</div><h3><b>The
Story behind this DVD </b></h3><div>
</div><p>Hi, I'm Chris Daniel, the Producer of this DVD. The reason I produced this video is
because I am a father (also a video producer).  I am also a martial artist, and firmly believe in being prepared.  I cannot
count the times that I've told my kids safety instructions whenever we went
out or when they would go to a friend’s house to play. One day I decided to try
to put that information into a video that could help other kids as well.  </p><div>
</div><p>I first met Dr. Long on a TV
commercial shoot. I brought my daughter Nicole along to the shoot because she was a big
fan of Dr. Long and loved watching her on Sesame Street.  So when it came
time to make the video, I immediately reached out to her and we created this
program.  <br/></p><p>When Dr. Long recently suggested that we re-issue this DVD as a
special give away...I said ""great idea"" and thought crowdfunding
could make it happen.  <br/></p><div>

 Division, is the last paratrooper who jumped from Whiskey 7 
over Normandy on D-Day.  Les is a hero, our friend, and a partner in the effort to stop time for that one moment where the past becomes the present for all Americans to enjoy.



Getting W7 back to her D-Day configuration will mean installing items that have long since been removed.  Equipment no longer available needs to be created from original drawings.  A fabrication shop has agreed to do the work and by becoming a partner you will insure the parts we need are installed for our next season.  We need $35,000 for Interior Items on our Phase One List: items for the radio room, navigator's station, and the cabin area (litter supports and troop seats.)


Additional dollars over Phase One will be used on restoration items to   includeg recovering flight controls and repainting them to the proper colors and markings:  exterior items like antennas, glider tow equipment, and many other minor.









Please select one of these levels of support and accept these items as our thanks for becoming part of our mission.



Our volunteers have been teaching about the events of World War II for 31 years from our base in Geneseo NY where we host an annual airshow known as ""The Greatest Show on Turf"".  We also send aircraft to events across the United States to serve as a living history lesson especially for children and young adults.  
With this funding we will:

Expand our ability to illustrate the techniques used during the airborne assaults in Europe.
Show technologies used to navigate and communicate with ground and air services across the globe.

Develop S.T.E.M. (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) programs by connecting the technology of the past  through the study of aircraft operations and navigation systems.

By becoming a partner in this project, you will be assisting the teaching of our history and encouraging young people to appreciate the struggles which helped make the world free for millions.  


in 1995 the National Warplane Museum was granted a Charter as an Educational Institution by the New York State Board of Regents and is a 501(c)(3) organization.  We have consistently demonstrated our ability to set goals, work toward reaching them and being a good steward of donations.  With this project, we will continue that legacy of trust by having a standard control of documents, artifacts and financial stewardship mandated by this endeavor.  The yearly audits of our programs and records insure the proper tracking of assets and costs.  We report all activity to New York State to insure we continue to earn and maintain our reputation as an educational institution. 



  


We realize not everyone is in a position to donate financially to this cause. 
Here are ways you can make this project a success:



Share this campaign with friends, roommates, relatives, military & veterans groups and coworkers -- both past and present! Share on Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, forums – every little bit counts!

<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>Without adequate funding, Boomerang must
raise funds to grow into the stand alone festival, and a major contributor to
the North NSW cultural landscape, tourism and economy, as well as a landmark
event for Australia.</p>
<p>NSW has the largest population of Aboriginal
Australians than any other state in the country, and less fiscal support than
other regions in the country. Ownership &amp; pro-activeness with art &amp;
culture is key to empowerment and inclusion in our diverse society.</p>
<p></p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>In order for Boomerang to run effectively in 2016 we need $30,000. We've already raised $7,000 - so we aim to raise the remaining $23,000 on this platform.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Additional funds will be placed in trust to go towards the future 
development of Boomerang into an independent, stand-alone festival (for which, we ultimately need over $600,000).</p>
<p>Each package has different features and benefits, with a focus on 
local and Indigenous experiences so you get a unique, cultural 
experience in exchange for your support.</p>

Boomerang Festival is a global indigenous
arts & culture event aimed at Aboriginal access for
audiences wishing
to engage
with a
quality, unique, true Indigenous experience. 
It encompasses dance, weaving, carving,
talks & ideas, workshops, music & authentic cultural
exchanges between Aboriginal & non-Aboriginal people.



With full support of and in conjunction with Bluesfest Byron Bay's 
Festival Director, Peter Noble, produced from an Aboriginal perspective
by one of Australia’s most accomplished & respected Artistic
Directors,  and proud Bundjalung woman,
Rhoda Roberts (Sydney
Opera House, The Dreaming Festival,  2000
Sydney Olympic Games Opening Ceremony, Garma Festival), Boomerang 
Festival is programmed with
high-quality performance art, featuring masters of craft & cultural 
leaders
from around the globe. 


Boomerang ran successfully in 2013 in Byron Bay, on the Bluesfest 
site, to widespread audience and critical acclaim. It was nominated for 
several major arts and tourism awards, and contributed significantly to 
the local tourism and economic sectors.




However, both arts and Indigenous funding was cut, and forced the 
indefinite suspension of what was heralded as new way forward in 
harmonious relations for all Australians, and imperative national 
healing.

   What We Need & What You Get 
Without adequate funding, Boomerang must
raise funds to grow into the stand alone festival, and a major contributor to
the North NSW cultural landscape, tourism and economy, as well as a landmark
event for Australia.
NSW has the largest population of Aboriginal
Australians than any other state in the country, and less fiscal support than
other regions in the country. Ownership & pro-activeness with art &
culture is key to empowerment and inclusion in our diverse society.



In order for Boomerang to run effectively in 2016 we need $30,000. We've already raised $7,000 - so we aim to raise the remaining $23,000 on this platform.


Additional funds will be placed in trust to go towards the future 
development of Boomerang into an independent, stand-alone festival (for which, we ultimately need over $600,000).
Each package has different features and benefits, with a focus on 
local and Indigenous experiences so you get a unique, cultural 
experience in exchange for your support.

Boomerang offers the solution to this
discrepancy between people interested in engaging, and not knowing how to

Risks & Challenges
As a progressive and forward-thinking artistic team, Bluesfest & 
Boomerang festival recognise that we might be ahead of our time. But the
 importance of the event, and readiness of the community for it is 
undeniable.
The volatility of the economy and arts industry will affect us, 
however, with the expertise of astute and revered festival programmers 
in Peter Noble and Rhoda Roberts, along with their dedicated and 
experienced teams, we are confident we can hedge against negative 
impacts.
Our biggest challenge is garnering the support of the people who will benefit from it the most - the Australian public.

       I am starting this fundraising campaign because I need your help in creating a school that I wish existed today. A school where my colleagues and I would be excited to teach every day. A school where technology helps advance musicianship. A place I wish I could have attended as a student. And a place where we prepare the musicians of tomorrow by cultivating artistry through community. 



I am Dave Carroll, the founder of The Conservatory. I've been teaching music in Massachusetts for over 10 years. I've taught everywhere from public schools to in-home private lessons. What I've seen throughout my work has inspired me to create a new school for music education and I need your help. So many schools and lesson programs are missing the 21st century learning model that students need for success today. My passion for music education has led me to build a school where we will provide the tools for musicians of all ages and skill levels to develop their craft and love of music together. I need your support to make this program flourish. 


Since graduating Boston University with a degree in music education and throughout my teaching experiences I have seen good and bad in music education. I have worked extensively in creating a model for teaching that is based on positive learning atmosphere coupled with technology. The model adapts to each student's individual learning style and integrates music theory with ease. With this technique I have seen students succeed and most importantly develop a love and appreciation for music. The Conservatory will embody this music education style.  


Located in Newton Highlands, Massachusetts we are easily accessible by the T and perfect to drive to with lots of parking. This location will allow the best musicians from Boston and elsewhere to join us in creating a vibrant music community.




 

Programs


   If we can reach our goal The Conservatory will offer very unique programs: 



Ensemble lessons where students can play together in rock bands, chamber groups, jazz bands and more. 


Private lessons where students learn one on one with the best teachers in the area.

Master classes taught by musicians from New England and beyond. These sessions will range from performances to lectures to song writing seminars. 

Adult group lessons where adults can learn an instrument together, or be directed in a band.

Special needs classes creating a a place where music is hands on for everyone in the community. 

Early education music and movement classes because the earlier you are exposed to music and movement the better!

Technology classes (recording, engineering, producing) specializing in the music production software that is becoming a bigger and bigger part of the music industry everyday. 

Performences/Open Mic recitals where students can present and perform their work. 








Help

We need a lot of help to get this project off the ground. Some of the funding for this project will go to the technology needed to create a 21st century learning model. Tablets, computers and recording equipment are needed to make this technological driven school a possibility. 

Creating an optimal space for performances and group lessons is very expensive. Although we were lucky enough to find an ideal location, it needs renovating to make it great.

It is going to take a lot of work to get The Conservatory started and we need the help of the community. Everything from marketing to construction is going to be a big initiative. And we need as much help as we can get!


Perks

With your contributions you can have access to discounts on private or group lessons as well as masterclasses in the first year of our school. You can be invited to our grand opening parties or just sign up for a T shirt or other great swag. 


    The Impact The Conservatory will not just be another music lesson school. My vision is a place where musicians grow together and prepare for the role that music will play in the rest of their lives. By contributing to this school you are helping create the best music education program in the area that will help so many students develop their goals in a positive learning environment.

</div></div>","Short Summary

We are Top Note Performing Arts Academy. We started as a summer camp with our sister company, Top Note Music 
Academy and have gained enough momentum to start our own school. 
Now we need your donations to successfully open the doors to our new space in the Lincolnwood Town Center in the Northwest suburbs of Chicago. 

We have made a lot of progress with the renovations. We are
 ready to start classes in early February, but we need some help with 
the finishing touches. 
Your donations will help our passionate educators bring arts education to children of all ages, so please donate.Your support for arts education will help create a generation of people who are confident, compassionate, and multi-faceted. 


  What We Need & What You Get
After seemingly never-ending issues with permits and licensing and self-crafted construction, we are almost ready to open our doors. We have beautifully painted walls and a nicely laid floor, a few odds and ends to piece together office and waiting room furniture, but our space is bare. Your generous donations will help us acquire the following:



 Audio equipment (surround-sound speakers for two classrooms, microphones, microphone stands, microphone cables, speaker cables, sound mixer)

Storage and shelving (This need includes: bookshelves, hooks/shelving/storage for students' belongings, storage bins/shelves for props, costumes, etc., and cabinets for our office and front desk areas.)
Props (This need includes all types of simple things that could help set a scene or story. For example: hats, capes, jackets, canes, sports balls, stuffed animal, blankets, overalls, purses, boots, lamp, pool floaties, neckties, tutus, and sports equipment.)
Refrigerator (Our classes take place after school, we host multiple hour long camps and workshops, and our educators plan on spending ample time in our space. We have a full kitchen, but nothing to keep our students' snacks cold. We're not looking for a stainless steel, freezer on bottom, ice maker in the door kind of fridge. Just a good ol' full size refrigerator.)
Dance bar and mirrored wall (We offer dance classes too! We also want our Theatre Fundamentals and Music and Performance students to be able to see themselves perform, to better understand what the audience sees. We have a perfect wall on the far side of our main classroom, all it's missing is a mirror and dance bar.) 

Furniture (seating for the lobby)

Decor (Your donations will help us decorate, adding lively and inviting artwork to a creative and energetic space.) 

A budget for future workshops and classes. The more resources we have, the better equipped we will be to expand our programming and most importantly, keep our prices as accessible as possible for families of all income brackets.

Our perks were carefully thought out by our own group of multi-talented educators and we hope you appreciate our thoughtful and handcrafted offerings. If we are unable to reach our goal of $5,000 we will still use whatever monies are acquired towards the purchase of the above items.

<p>11. Iron pipes (rebar) inserted in concrete foundation: COMPLETED 2016</p>
<h2><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h2>
<p>What we need moving forward (costs include transportation, workmanship and materials): </p>
<p>*Materials include cement, sand, metal, wood, nails, paint, stone, gravel, shovel, wheel barrows, toilets, pipes, kitchen appliances, bamboo and drinking water </p>
<p>1. Concrete poured to create first and second floor: $3500</p>

<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We need to finish the Artist Home. We need blocks, bricks, metal, concrete, wood and piping. We need to build 3 bathrooms, so we need to buy appliances for those as well as for an outdoor kitchen. We need materials to build a simple outdoor workshop shelter, and to build a playground for the community children. </li>
<li>We have drums, drum classes, lessons and a drum circle for up to 60 people as our perks. VERY EXCITING! Please do give and we'll ""Perk"" you. </li>
<li>If we do not reach our goal, all the money that's donated will still go toward building the Artist Home. We want you, our community to help us finish this project! This is our greatest hope.</li>
<li>YOUR DONATION is TAX-DEDUCTIBLE! </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>1st - Our craftworkers have a home and a place to work, indefinitely. THEY ARE NO LONGER AT RISK OF BEING DISPLACED. </p>
<p>2nd - Hands on Drums, with our without a storefront, can continue importing and selling our craftworkers' beautiful creations. This benefits the craftworkers and their families, as well as our work here in DC, and all of the people that work impacts. The more successful our cooperative economics become, the further our reach. Young women in YWDEP, young men in DUFP, all of our students and those who benefit from our workshops and performances. </p>
<p>3rd - We can begin regular mentoring programs on the land with young people from the village of Senya Beraku. These young people will engage in mentor/mentee relationships with our craftworkers. They will apprentice with them to learn crafts such as batiking, carving, jewelry and mask making, tailoring, drum building and more. Their knowledge becomes their power. They create, we purchase by direct trade, they have a place to live and work and money to take care of their families, in perpetuity. Their children go to school, and grow up with more opportunities and a better life. Amen and Ashe. </p>
<p>4th - When you come to Ghana (via our Akoma Tours or otherwise), you have a place to stay. Whether you are coming to learn how to build drums, or do batik arts or learn other crafts from our craftworkers, or take drumming and xylophone lessons, or spend time with the community children, playing with them and/or tutoring them, or if even if you just came to soak in the sun, sand and surf: WE HAVE A PLACE. </p>
<p>5th - Once the Artist Home, outdoor kitchen, playground and sheltered workshop are built, our next step is CREATE A COOPERATIVE. This means understanding how our craftworkers - and this includes a women's community near Senya Beraku who make black soap - can turn their arts into real life improvements. It means investigating models of co-operative building and figuring out which works best. Then working with the craftworkers to understand their own goals, how they match up with our goals, and figuring out how to achieve them together. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Despite obstacles and challenges, like rarely having cash-on-hand; living as self-employed artists in one of the most expensive areas of the country (Washington, DC); raising a child; moving our store from our basement to our first shop (for 3 months) to our current shop; miscommunications as we push forward, even though we come from such different backgrounds - we have achieved so much in just 7 years. Possibly the biggest success has been the growth of our community (YOU). We have taken 20 people to Ghana on fulfilling cultural immersion tours; we've received imports from our craftworkers no less than 12 times and have showed up to dozens of markets locally and regionally prior to receiving our storefront. And our storefront! This came from a contest we applied to and WON through Cultural DC. And even though that storefront was slated for only 3 months, ReCreative Spaces in DC believed in our work and found us another spot for a full year. Ashe! We have produced at least a dozen successful events including a yearly African bazaar and fundraiser; weekend workshop series with master drummers Monette Marino, Dr Djo Bi from the Ivory Coast and Sayon Camara from Guinea; Greenbelt Rhythm &amp; Drum Festival and more. We've performed over 100 times as the Bele Bele Rhythm Collective, the Akoma Drummers, YWDEP and with Cheick Hamala Diabate. We continue to teach classes and bring drumming experiences that uplift communities to wherever we are called. Building unity through the drum, and building a community based on the joy of drumming and the concept of cooperative economics. We will continue to rise with your support, as we always have. When we say WE, it means all of us, together.  Ashe! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We need assistance: </p>
<p>*Digital Assistant - someone to help us with updating websites, refreshing our online shop, keeping our brand popping up on all social media paradigms, especially when we have events or campaigns coming up </p>
<p>*Creative/Journalistic - someone to assist us in creating profiles of all our craftworkers. Photos, bios, and videos of each, so that our DC and Ghana communities can better interface with one another. </p>
<p>*Organizational - someone to help us creating and maintaining databases of our community both here and in Ghana. </p>
<p>*Logistical - someone we can call upon whenever we need assistance with our events. Set up, take down, running errands, etc. </p>
<p>*Childcare! - for our wonderful son Kwame, who will be inheriting all of this someday! </p>

</div><h2>The Problem</h2><p></p><p>Most Nigerian children share these challenges on a daily basis:</p><p>“Our teacher does not come to school.”</p>
<p>""I feel lost in the classroom but I can't ask questions because there are
so many of us in the classroom.""</p><p>""Our teacher comes to the classroom, writes the note on the board and leaves us alone""<br/></p>
<p>""I don't know how long I can stay in school for because my parents need me

</p><p>Their reality reflects a broken education system that makes it 
difficult for Nigerian children to
receive an excellent education, consequently making it impossible for them 
to fully
realize their potential. The statistics paint a grim picture: Nigeria has the largest number of out of school children in the world despite that, <b>60% of the children enrolled in primary 
school are not learning</b>. The quality of teaching and learning is so poor that many don't 
go to secondary school, and of those that go to secondary school many 
can't even read and write when they finish (WASSCE results indicate this rot),
 and only about 10% make it to the tertiary level. This has frightening consequences for the development of our country. We must ask ourselves - are we educating the teachers, doctors, entrepreneurs, politicians and leaders of tomorrow? <b>How will people of 
this quality of education build the kind of country we want?</b></p><b>Nigeria's educational system is in crisis and this is why Teach For Nigeria exist.</b><br/><p>We believe in the power of every

 solution starts with capable young Nigerians who are passionate about

Here are some photos from our Photo Booth day at Discover Engineering Family Day so you can see that your contribution will go to something you can feel really good about.Visit The Wall to see more photos of the kids and teens.And here are some photos of the booth...Who are we?We are a group of civil engineers and individuals who want to see more diversity in civil engineering.  Many of us are civil engineers ourselves and we know the challenges and rewards of the field. We started I Look Like A Civil Engineer after being inspired by Isis Anchalee and the worldwide response to I Look Like An Engineer last summer.  We’ve been operating so far on our own savings, passion, and belief that what we’re doing is as important now as ever. Visit our blog to learn more about how we got involved and why we're motivated by this issue. To read more about us, visit our About Us page. What investment has been made to date?1,000+ hours of work, fueled entirely by our passion and savings accounts$10,000 in donated funding$15,000 in donated servicesCountless generous contributions of family, friends, and colleagues - editing, filming, reviewing, providing feedback, designing graphics, and more. See a list of all of our Founding Contributors. If We Exceed our Target GoalIf we exceed our target goal, this will allow us to:Take our Photo Booth to more kids and teensSpread the word in more places, all over, through social media, visiting local colleges and schools, representing I Look Like a Civil Engineer at career and STEM events, and moreInterview and conduct surveys of Engineers, students, young people, and the public to refine our message and measure our impactThis Campaign is About More than 25KWe need your support.  What we plan to do can only be possible with the support of our communities.

</div><div> <p>Hi, America. I'm No One, the only <a href=""http://noone2016.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">openly parodical presidential candidate</a> in the 2016 field. While I'm not actually running for office, I would like to do something that many candidates for President never will: have lunch and candid discussion with people without charging thousands of dollars per plate. Since I'm a normal guy with a full time job, I need your help to make this happen.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">Where You Come In</span></p>
</div><div>
<div>There are 50 states in the Union, plus DC. I'd like to have a lunch with food and dialogue for anyone who's interested in attending--even if he or she is not a registered voter. Since state capitals are the seat of the state government, it makes the most sense to do it there. Assuming airfare of $500 round trip (low ball estimate) comes out to $25,500 for all 51 capitals. I'd also like to budget another $14,500 for food and venue, although I'm a frugal guy so I'll make every effort to keep costs at a minimum. That works out to just under $285 per location for food and a place to eat it. (I added a little extra because IndieGoGo takes a fee and depending on the number of backers I may need to get more stickers printed.)</div>
<div></div>
</div><h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The Purpose</span></h3><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Why am I doing this? Well, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-382TqnvgU"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">I made a video about that</a>, but in short:</span><br/></p><div> <ul> <li>It seems many people feel they aren't being heard by their government.</li> <li>Even though I'm not a government official and have no real plan to become one, I intend to take notes and send them to the elected officials who represent each state.</li> <li>To prove there <b>is</b> such a thing as a free lunch.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Challenges</h3>
<p> I have a full time job. I'm a normal-ish guy. I'm not looking to quit my job since I like it a lot. That means I will be doing most of this on the weekends, which makes for a difficult schedule. Given that there are 51 places to visit and 52 weeks in a year, I am going to have to double book some weekends in order to make sure I can visit every state. It's also possible I won't raise enough money to visit each capital city. Here are a few ways I plan on making at least some of this happen no matter what:</p> <ul> <li>Priority given to most populous and swing states.</li> <li>Itinerary will be optimized for as many double-capital weekends as possible.</li>
<li>Will coordinate with local activist groups for venue and food donations.</li>
<li>If necessary I can take a vacation day or two from work.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Believe me when I say I understand times are tight for many people. Even though pledge amounts start at $1, I know not everyone is in a position to give money. Fortunately there are still several ways you can help:</p> <ul> <li>Do you or someone you know live in a state capital?

 Hi, America. I'm No One, the only openly parodical presidential candidate in the 2016 field. While I'm not actually running for office, I would like to do something that many candidates for President never will: have lunch and candid discussion with people without charging thousands of dollars per plate. Since I'm a normal guy with a full time job, I need your help to make this happen.
Where You Come In

There are 50 states in the Union, plus DC. I'd like to have a lunch with food and dialogue for anyone who's interested in attending--even if he or she is not a registered voter. Since state capitals are the seat of the state government, it makes the most sense to do it there. Assuming airfare of $500 round trip (low ball estimate) comes out to $25,500 for all 51 capitals. I'd also like to budget another $14,500 for food and venue, although I'm a frugal guy so I'll make every effort to keep costs at a minimum. That works out to just under $285 per location for food and a place to eat it. (I added a little extra because IndieGoGo takes a fee and depending on the number of backers I may need to get more stickers printed.)

The PurposeWhy am I doing this? Well, I made a video about that, but in short:  It seems many people feel they aren't being heard by their government. Even though I'm not a government official and have no real plan to become one, I intend to take notes and send them to the elected officials who represent each state. To prove there is such a thing as a free lunch.    Challenges
 I have a full time job. I'm a normal-ish guy. I'm not looking to quit my job since I like it a lot. That means I will be doing most of this on the weekends, which makes for a difficult schedule. Given that there are 51 places to visit and 52 weeks in a year, I am going to have to double book some weekends in order to make sure I can visit every state. It's also possible I won't raise enough money to visit each capital city. Here are a few ways I plan on making at least some of this happen no matter what:  Priority given to most populous and swing states. Itinerary will be optimized for as many double-capital weekends as possible.
Will coordinate with local activist groups for venue and food donations.
If necessary I can take a vacation day or two from work.    Other Ways You Can Help Believe me when I say I understand times are tight for many people. Even though pledge amounts start at $1, I know not everyone is in a position to give money. Fortunately there are still several ways you can help:  Do you or someone you know live in a state capital? Get in touch with us if you are able to offer food or assistance with finding locations that can host large groups of people.
Help get the word out by sharing this fundraiser on Facebook, Twitter, G+, and other social networks. Follow the campaign on social media!   Thank you so much for your support and for reading!

A lined latrine is sustainable in that it can always be emptied whenever it is full up ( this would be once in a bout 6 years). This means that the school can be able to use it for many years.They latrine will provide 2 stands for boys, 2 stands for girls, a washroom for girls, a urinal for boys, a hand washing facility for all, and good sanitation messages to aid learning among the younger children.
 The project shall go a long way to improve the sanitation situation at the school. Children will get more interested in attending school, and improve on the classroom results of the entire school.We hope you can kindly consider helping us to help keep these children in school; for they need Education for a better future. 100% of the funds will be used towards the implementation of the project.Every donation counts. Nothing is small, and we appreciate our love and kindness. Share this campaign with your friends and family and help us reach our goal in time, so that the situation at the school can be saved in time.
Thank you so much.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>The design of the “Palenque Cultural Tambillo” is the result of
participatory workshops with the community and extensive architectural and
social investigation by the Ochún Foundation, Caá Porá and Siete86. The main
desire and need of the community was the construction of a space that
represented their cultural history and construction methods. As architects we
strove to understand the lengthy history, technical aspects and ceremonial
significance of each material and spatial configuration. We interviewed master
carpenters, fishermen and women, storytellers, dancers and musicians from
Tambillo and the neighboring communities to understand the best woods for each
phase of construction, traditional joinery methods and to understand the
meaning and legends behind the music and dances. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466637974/6_q2s8vh.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 591px;height: 394px;""/></p><p>We also investigated the ceremonial spaces of the African Diaspora and pre-colonial
African civilizations in Cameroon, Nigeria, the Congo amongst others to
understand spatial configuration and the ceremonial use of similar materials to
those available in Tambillo. This process of the reconstruction of
architectural ceremonial identities was inspired by the similar reconstruction
of social and spiritual identity undertaken by many communities of the African Diaspora.</p>
<p>Based on this information we worked with engineers to devise modern and replicable
construction solutions for the construction of the community center. </p><p><b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1467300332/20160223_3d_Estructura-01_vw9sai.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>During the process of investigation, many of the community members in Tambillo let us visit their land to see what construction materials where locally available. The challenges of building in a protected ecological reserve and in a mangrove grove inspired engineering solutions and creative use of materials. One example of the solutions developed with our structural engineer is the use of oyster and conch shells that are discarded as part of the heavy fishing industry in Tambillo as additives to our rammed earth walls and concrete foundations. The main structure elements of the performance hall are locally and responsibly sourced wood. The roof of the dance hall is made of palm thatch, while the classrooms and workshops have zinc roofs with acoustical and thermal insulation.<br/></p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466638023/7_yob2xj.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 594px;height: 396px;""/></p>
<p>The “Palenque Cultural Tambillo” is designed
as a refuge from the pressures of everyday life in Tambillo. The spaces are
sheltered and conceived as a series of intimate and public courtyards. These
flexible outdoor spaces are shaded and usable during the hot tropical days.
Each building has a direct relationship with nature, and an important part of
the project is the outside gardens that will function as nurseries for future
reforestation initiatives.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1467302251/05_INTERIOR_EDsm_e7keor.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>The performance hall has a dance floor made
of sand that hearkens to the traditional dances in outdoor spaces. The
musicians are on a second level permitting clear sight lines for the
spectators. The roof shell will conserve excellent acoustics while the palm
thatch will absorb excess percussive sound. One side of the building is opened towards
the mangroves to emphasize the direct relationship between the traditional
storytelling role of the dances and the natural environment that inspires them.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1467310889/20160227_plan_ENGLISH_vrk2da.jpg"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p><br/>
<p>The classrooms and workshops are more closely aligned to current local
construction. They have been designed as examples of cost-accessible,
earthquake-proof, easily constructed, climactically comfortable buildings using
materials that can be locally sourced with minimal ecological impact. This is
very important in Tambillo and other communities in the region where, because
of social aspirations to homogenous modernity, concrete block has replaced much
more cost and climactically efficient traditional forms of construction.</p>

These 25 workers, which will be supplemented by volunteers, have a cost of over $50,000 for the approximately four month long construction phase ($500 a month per worker, which is a standard monthly salary). Since not many people have credit cards in these communities we will also, in partnership with the Ochún Foundation and local government, be having fundraising musical events and dinners. If you are in Ecuador or can travel and would like to know more about these events please let us know. We will be posting pictures as these happen. </p><p>We are using locally sourced materials as much as possible to lower costs and to promote a real sense of ownership amongst the people of Tambillo.

Any construction, especially in areas that don't have road access to large cities, is always risky. We will have to take into consideration: varying and typically humid climates, difficulties with tool maintenance because of exposure to salty air, and the working with teams of workers with who we have not worked before. The good thing is that as a team we have several projects worth of experience of working together with all of these challenges. Patricio Cevallos is one of the leading alternative structural engineers in Ecuador and South America and has been our, and many other people's, guide in award-winning and challenging projects. We have been working for months with Patricio to prepare a detailed budget and construction schedule and with Malena, the President of Tambillo, to organize the site, materials, tools and coordination of labor logistics. We will continue to hammer out details and prepare materials during this crowdfunding phase. <div>
<br/><p>The biggest step we've taken to avoid risk has been to completely involve the community in every step of the process. Each meeting we have had with different members, whether they be farmers, carpenters, concheras, or teachers has taught us something new about how to best build this project, what it will real uses of the space, and what the pressing needs of the children are.

Tambillo es un centro cultural dedicado a continuar con las tradiciones
artísticas del pueblo afro ecuatoriano de Tambillo y es nacionalmente conocido
por el grupo de marimba y danza “Incrustados en el Mangar”. Este grupo promueve
el vinculo intergeneracional de transmisión oral e historia de la marimba del
pueblo de Tambillo, promueve a los niños y jóvenes a tener un lugar seguro
donde desarrollar una identidad basada en los saberes ancestrales de su
herencia cultural.</p>
<p>Como parte de una larga

<p>Las
oficinas de Caá
Porá arquitectura, Siete86 arquitectos e Ingeniería Alternativa empezamos un
proceso de investigación y diseño participativo con la comunidad de Tambillo en
Octubre 2015. Estos procesos participativos han generado en un diseño de un
complejo cultural compuesto de: un espacio de presentaciones y lugar de
encuentro, dos aulas multiuso, un taller de fabricación de instrumentos
musicales y una batería de baños con un sistema ecológico de recolección y
desalojo de agua. Estos espacios se han diseñado tomando en cuenta las
necesidades de la agrupación de niños y jóvenes, los problemas de
infraestructura de la comunidad y técnicas de construcción que se puedes
aplicar y replicar dentro de la comunidad para su desarrollo a futuro. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>SITUACIÓN ACTUAL</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Tambillo es un pueblo afro-ecuatoriano en una isla al extremo noroeste del Ecuador. Esta ubicación ha sido de suma importancia en el desarrollo de las costumbres de la zona. Es un lugar donde casi toda familia tiene primos de cada lado de la frontera con Colombia. Se considera que Tambillo queda justo en las Rutas de la Concha y de la Marimba que descienden desde Colombia.</p>
<p>El pueblo se encuentra dentro de la Reserva Ecológica Manglares Cayapas -Mataje en la provincia de Esmeraldas, Ecuador. Esta reserva cuenta con más de 49.000 ha, en su mayor parte bosques de manglares, y fue declarada como Sitio Ramsar por la UNESCO en 2003.Las aguas e islas aledañas a Tambillo se encuentran vestigios arqueológicos de la cultura Tolita (500 a.C. - 500 d.C.). Hoy en día los pobladores de Tambillo y los pueblos aledaños son en su mayoría afrodescendientes o mestizos.</p>
<p>La población de Tambillo es de 2200 personas, de las cuales un 60% están entre la edad de 5 a 19 años. Esta población tiene problemas como: violencia sexual y explotación sexual, violencia intrafamiliar, adolescentes que pierden vínculo con sus familias y habilitan su identidad y su sentido de pertenencia con otros grupos (pandillas, explotación sexual, otros delitos), la escuela no logra ser un referente de visión para ellos y ellas; su acción es insuficiente frente al entorno, maltrato psicológico, violencia intrafamiliar, embarazo adolescente, relación entre violencia común y delitos y situación de adolescentes y niños/as, trabajo infantil.</p>
<p></p>
<p>En el año 2005 Alfredo García, Héctor Ortiz y Malena Solís crearon la asociación “Incrustados en el Manglar”, un grupo de música y baile conformado por los niños y jóvenes entre 5 y 19 años de la isla de Tambillo. Durante más de una década esta agrupación ha alcanzado varios logros a nivel nacional posicionándose entre los representantes de la música de la marimba. Sin embargo este no ha sido un proceso sencillo y la falta de apoyo institucional ha frenado el desarrollo de la agrupación. Actualmente “Incrustados en el Manglar” comparte la sede con la junta parroquial de Tambillo donde realizan sus ensayos cada tarde en la planta baja del lugar.</p>
<p>Actualmente este espacio plantea una serie de dificultades, la construcción de bloque y cemento conforma una habitación de 112 metros cuadrados. Esta área alberga a la banda de música y a los bailarines, quienes en medio de un piso desgastado realizan los ensayos cada tarde. El área no es suficiente y los ensayos deben ajustarse a un espacio interrumpido por columnas, solo pueden practicar durante las noches pues la temperatura en horas del día los sofoca. En medio de estas condiciones los pobladores de Tambillo se reúnen a observar los ensayos, los sitios para observar son pocos, los niños se sientan procurando no estorbar la coreografía, mientras que el resto de público observa desde afuera, agrupándose en las ventanas disponibles.</p>
<p>La comunidad está comprometida con la agrupación y los acompañan en todos sus ensayos. Cada día tanto maestros como jóvenes se esfuerzan para sacar adelante a “Incrustados en el Manglar”.</p>
<p><b>EL PROYECTO</b></p>
<p>El diseño del Palenque Cultural Tambillo se hizo en conjunto con la comunidad por medio de talleres participativos e investigación intensiva realizada por Fundación Ochun, Caá Porá arquitectura y Siete86 arquitectos sobre la historia de la cultura afro-ecuatoriana. El gran anhelo y necesitad de la comunidad era la construcción de un espacio que represente su historia cultural y sistemas constructivos. Como arquitectos trabajamos muy duro para entender su legado histórico, aspectos técnicos y significado ceremonial de cada uno de los materiales y configuración espacial.</p>
<p>Realizamos una investigación sobre espacios ceremoniales de la Diáspora Africana y civilizaciones pre coloniales en Camerún, Nigeria, El Congo y otros para entender la configuración especial y usos ceremoniales de materiales de los que se pueden encontrar en Tambillo. Basándonos en esta información trabajamos con ingenieros para diseñar soluciones modernas que se puedan replicar para la construcción del centro cultural.</p>
<p>Los moradores de Tambillo nos permitieron ingresar a sus fincas dentro de los manglares para poder ver los materiales locales que disponen para la construcción.  Para la cimentación se utilizará cadenas de piedra que permiten aislar el suelo pantanoso y salobre. Con esta cimentación se puede alzar la estructura compuesta de madera cuadrada de 15 cm  de nato, laguna y laurel, las juntas de madera son tradicionales y  modernas.  Los muros de 40 cm de grosor se harán con mezclas de distintas tonalidades de tierras locales compactadas y mezcladas con ostiones. La cubierta será tejida de palma real.</p>
<p>El Palenque Cultural Tambillo se expresa en la forma de un centro de baile, una escuela de formación para músicos y bailarines y talleres para la creación de instrumentos musicales. Comprende dos espacios: el área de baile, que es el edificio principal, y las aulas de multiuso y talleres.</p>
<p>El área de baile cumple al papel de “refugio” en las afueras del pueblo generando privacidad. Es el lugar de ensayo y presentación la agrupación “Incrustados en el Manglar”. Se encuentra cerca del manglar y se abre hacia éste, creando un vínculo más estrecho entre lo natural y la expresión artística.</p>
<p>Las aulas y talleres proyectan la arquitectura local. Estos bloques se implantan dejando patios internos entre ellos que apoyan a las actividades internas. Finalmente existe un área de crecimiento donde se prevé el desarrollo del complejo, con una serie de servicios complementarios, como sala de grabación, alojamiento para turistas y cocina, etc. En esta zona de crecimiento se plantea la creación de un vivero durante las primeras etapas de construcción.</p>
<p>Este proyecto es una herramienta para que la agrupación Incrustados en el Manglar amplíe sus objetivos y siga instruyendo y apoyando a los niños y jóvenes de Tambillo en cultivar cultura y saberes ancestrales. La agrupación Incrustados en el Manglar ha impactado a los niños y jóvenes de Tambillo en su comportamiento, entendimiento de su entorno y generando vínculos de hermandad entre sus compañeros.</p>
<p><b>EL PRESUPUESTO</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Esto Proyecto se ha decidido construir en dos fases. El diseño que se recaudara servirá para los materiales que no son accesibles localmente, la transportación de los mismos  y costos de administración. El Gobierno Autónomo Descentralizado de Tambillo ha asumido la responsabilidad de cubrir los costos de mano de obra local de la comunidad. Estos 25 trabajadores y artesanos tendrán un costo de 50mil dólares aproximadamente por los cuatro meses que dure la construcción.</p>
<p>Estamos usando materiales locales lo mas posible para reducir los costos y promover la sensación de pertenencia dentro del pueblo de Tambillo. Adentrarnos a los manglares y fincas de los comuneros ha sido importantes para generar esta sensación de pertenencia con la gente de Tambillo que está involucrada.</p>

CULTURAL CENTER(Para español haga scroll hasta abajo, el video en español es el segundo cuadrado de las fotos mas arriba)“Palenque Cultural Tambillo”
is a cultural center dedicated to the continuing artistic traditions of the Afroecuadorean
town of Tambillo and its nationally renowned travelling marimba music and dance
troupe Incrustados en el Manglar.
This group provides an intergenerational link for the transmission of the oral
and physical history of the town of Tambillo, allowing children of all ages a
safe space to develop strong identities based in an awareness of their personal
and cultural heritage. As part of a larger
investigation of Afro-ecuadorean culture, its musical traditions and its
present challenges, The Ochún Foundation, Caá Porá Architects and Siete86
Architects identified the town of Tambillo as an ideal place to begin the pilot
program of “Palenques Culturales”. The “Palenques” project is dedicated to the
creation of a network of cultural centers in communities that form part of the “region
of the marimba” in the province of Esmeraldas, Ecuador. This cultural region
was recently inscribed in 2015 as a part of the UNESCO list of the intangible
heritage of humanity. (http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/RL/marimba-music-traditional-chants-and-dances-from-the-colombia-south-pacific-region-and-esmeraldas-province-of-ecuador-01099) These celebrated traditions
are at risk because of intra-generational learning gaps, immigration and other
social factors.
The offices of Caá Porá,
Siete86 and Ingeniera Alternativa began a process of a participatory research
and design workshops with the community of Tambillo in October of 2015. These
workshops have resulted in the design of a cultural complex composed of: a
large performance and meeting hall, two multi-use classrooms and rehearsal
spaces, an artisanal workshop for the fabrication of instruments and a block of
public bathrooms using ecologically friendly water systems. These spaces have
been designed taking into account the needs of the cultural group, the
community infrastructure issues and the development of easily replicable
construction technology for the future development of the community.
THE
SITUATIONIn 2005, Alfredo García,
Héctor Ortiz and Malena Solís, all schoolteachers at the time, created the Incrustados en Manglar  (loosely translated as Embedded in the
Mangrove) association. This music and dance group accepts children between 5
and 19 years of age and is by far the largest youth group in the town of
Tambillo. In the past decade this group has achieved national recognition for
their touring shows and work preserving and growing the traditional, endemic
marimba musical styles. The group has achieved this through grassroots
community organization and support. The lack of external sponsorship has
prevented the leaders of Incrustados en
el Manglar from creating suitable infrastructure for teaching and
performing. Currently they practice every afternoon on the cracked tile floor
of the town municipal building.
This space is far from
suitable for as a rehearsal space and presents strong challenges of size,
upkeep, acoustics and temperature. Regardless of these difficulties, there are
many children and adults that gather every evening, even outside looking in
through the windows, to watch the development of original choreographies and
musical themes. Tambillo has an estimated population of 2,200 people currently, of which 60% are between the ages of 5 and 19. This imbalance results in social health problems such as: sexual violence and exploitation, intra-family violence, loss of self identity amongst youth and growth of gangs and violence, lack of self-identification in school materials and education, psychological abuse, teenage pregnancies, child labor amongst many others. Working with the children has been a huge part of this project, as they share their dreams and concerns as part of the design process.THE PROJECT
The design of the “Palenque Cultural Tambillo” is the result of
participatory workshops with the community and extensive architectural and
social investigation by the Ochún Foundation, Caá Porá and Siete86. The main
desire and need of the community was the construction of a space that
represented their cultural history and construction methods. As architects we
strove to understand the lengthy history, technical aspects and ceremonial
significance of each material and spatial configuration. We interviewed master
carpenters, fishermen and women, storytellers, dancers and musicians from
Tambillo and the neighboring communities to understand the best woods for each
phase of construction, traditional joinery methods and to understand the
meaning and legends behind the music and dances. We also investigated the ceremonial spaces of the African Diaspora and pre-colonial
African civilizations in Cameroon, Nigeria, the Congo amongst others to
understand spatial configuration and the ceremonial use of similar materials to
those available in Tambillo. This process of the reconstruction of
architectural ceremonial identities was inspired by the similar reconstruction
of social and spiritual identity undertaken by many communities of the African Diaspora.
Based on this information we worked with engineers to devise modern and replicable
construction solutions for the construction of the community center. During the process of investigation, many of the community members in Tambillo let us visit their land to see what construction materials where locally available. The challenges of building in a protected ecological reserve and in a mangrove grove inspired engineering solutions and creative use of materials. One example of the solutions developed with our structural engineer is the use of oyster and conch shells that are discarded as part of the heavy fishing industry in Tambillo as additives to our rammed earth walls and concrete foundations. The main structure elements of the performance hall are locally and responsibly sourced wood. The roof of the dance hall is made of palm thatch, while the classrooms and workshops have zinc roofs with acoustical and thermal insulation.

The “Palenque Cultural Tambillo” is designed
as a refuge from the pressures of everyday life in Tambillo. The spaces are
sheltered and conceived as a series of intimate and public courtyards. These
flexible outdoor spaces are shaded and usable during the hot tropical days.
Each building has a direct relationship with nature, and an important part of
the project is the outside gardens that will function as nurseries for future
reforestation initiatives.The performance hall has a dance floor made
of sand that hearkens to the traditional dances in outdoor spaces. The
musicians are on a second level permitting clear sight lines for the
spectators. The roof shell will conserve excellent acoustics while the palm
thatch will absorb excess percussive sound. One side of the building is opened towards
the mangroves to emphasize the direct relationship between the traditional
storytelling role of the dances and the natural environment that inspires them.
The classrooms and workshops are more closely aligned to current local
construction. They have been designed as examples of cost-accessible,
earthquake-proof, easily constructed, climactically comfortable buildings using
materials that can be locally sourced with minimal ecological impact. This is
very important in Tambillo and other communities in the region where, because
of social aspirations to homogenous modernity, concrete block has replaced much
more cost and climactically efficient traditional forms of construction.

These buildings will be tools for the Incrustados en el Manglar group as they grow. The Ochún Foundation
is assisting the members of this association in the legal process of becoming a
foundation able to channel external resources to the community. The creation of
a local foundation is an important aspect of this project, as it will permit
local actors larger agency in the type of external investments that are
realized in their community.THE BUDGETWe've divided this project into two phases. The money that we raise will go towards materials that aren't locally available and will also go towards offsetting the team's transportation and administration costs. The local community government has already assumed the responsibility of covering labor costs from skilled artisans within the community. These 25 workers, which will be supplemented by volunteers, have a cost of over $50,000 for the approximately four month long construction phase ($500 a month per worker, which is a standard monthly salary). Since not many people have credit cards in these communities we will also, in partnership with the Ochún Foundation and local government, be having fundraising musical events and dinners. If you are in Ecuador or can travel and would like to know more about these events please let us know. We will be posting pictures as these happen. We are using locally sourced materials as much as possible to lower costs and to promote a real sense of ownership amongst the people of Tambillo. Traveling to find possible sources of material has been a huge source of partnership between all involved. However, because we are in an ecological reserve, there will be materials we cannot harvest responsibly. Our budget is based on the costs for materials that we have not previously surveyed and come to a donation agreement with the local landowners.THE TEAM

GarcíaRISKS

Any construction, especially in areas that don't have road access to large cities, is always risky. We will have to take into consideration: varying and typically humid climates, difficulties with tool maintenance because of exposure to salty air, and the working with teams of workers with who we have not worked before. The good thing is that as a team we have several projects worth of experience of working together with all of these challenges. Patricio Cevallos is one of the leading alternative structural engineers in Ecuador and South America and has been our, and many other people's, guide in award-winning and challenging projects. We have been working for months with Patricio to prepare a detailed budget and construction schedule and with Malena, the President of Tambillo, to organize the site, materials, tools and coordination of labor logistics. We will continue to hammer out details and prepare materials during this crowdfunding phase. 
The biggest step we've taken to avoid risk has been to completely involve the community in every step of the process. Each meeting we have had with different members, whether they be farmers, carpenters, concheras, or teachers has taught us something new about how to best build this project, what it will real uses of the space, and what the pressing needs of the children are. We are confident that we will be able to bring this project to fruition in the timeframe we have planned.

El Palenque Cultural
Tambillo es un centro cultural dedicado a continuar con las tradiciones
artísticas del pueblo afro ecuatoriano de Tambillo y es nacionalmente conocido
por el grupo de marimba y danza “Incrustados en el Mangar”. Este grupo promueve
el vinculo intergeneracional de transmisión oral e historia de la marimba del
pueblo de Tambillo, promueve a los niños y jóvenes a tener un lugar seguro
donde desarrollar una identidad basada en los saberes ancestrales de su
herencia cultural.
Como parte de una larga
investigación de la cultura afro ecuatoriana, la tradición de su música y sus
desafíos actuales, la Fundación Casa Ochun, Caá Porá arquitectura, Siete86
arquitectos identificamos el pueblo de Tambillo como el lugar ideal para
empezar el plan piloto de la Red de Palenques Culturales. Los Palenques es un
proyecto dedicado a la creación de una red de centros culturales en comunidades
que son parte de la región de la marimba en la provincia de Esmeraldas,
Ecuador. Esta región cultural fue declarada parte de la lista de patrimonio
intangible de la humanidad por la UNESCO. (http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/RL/marimba-music-traditional-chants-and-dances-from-the-colombia-south-pacific-region-and-esmeraldas-province-of-ecuador-01099). Esta
tradición esta en riesgo por las brechas de aprendizaje intergeneracionales, la
migración y otros factores sociales.
Las
oficinas de Caá
Porá arquitectura, Siete86 arquitectos e Ingeniería Alternativa empezamos un
proceso de investigación y diseño participativo con la comunidad de Tambillo en
Octubre 2015. Estos procesos participativos han generado en un diseño de un
complejo cultural compuesto de: un espacio de presentaciones y lugar de
encuentro, dos aulas multiuso, un taller de fabricación de instrumentos
musicales y una batería de baños con un sistema ecológico de recolección y
desalojo de agua. Estos espacios se han diseñado tomando en cuenta las
necesidades de la agrupación de niños y jóvenes, los problemas de
infraestructura de la comunidad y técnicas de construcción que se puedes
aplicar y replicar dentro de la comunidad para su desarrollo a futuro. 

SITUACIÓN ACTUAL

Tambillo es un pueblo afro-ecuatoriano en una isla al extremo noroeste del Ecuador. Esta ubicación ha sido de suma importancia en el desarrollo de las costumbres de la zona. Es un lugar donde casi toda familia tiene primos de cada lado de la frontera con Colombia. Se considera que Tambillo queda justo en las Rutas de la Concha y de la Marimba que descienden desde Colombia.
El pueblo se encuentra dentro de la Reserva Ecológica Manglares Cayapas -Mataje en la provincia de Esmeraldas, Ecuador. Esta reserva cuenta con más de 49.000 ha, en su mayor parte bosques de manglares, y fue declarada como Sitio Ramsar por la UNESCO en 2003.Las aguas e islas aledañas a Tambillo se encuentran vestigios arqueológicos de la cultura Tolita (500 a.C. - 500 d.C.). Hoy en día los pobladores de Tambillo y los pueblos aledaños son en su mayoría afrodescendientes o mestizos.
La población de Tambillo es de 2200 personas, de las cuales un 60% están entre la edad de 5 a 19 años. Esta población tiene problemas como: violencia sexual y explotación sexual, violencia intrafamiliar, adolescentes que pierden vínculo con sus familias y habilitan su identidad y su sentido de pertenencia con otros grupos (pandillas, explotación sexual, otros delitos), la escuela no logra ser un referente de visión para ellos y ellas; su acción es insuficiente frente al entorno, maltrato psicológico, violencia intrafamiliar, embarazo adolescente, relación entre violencia común y delitos y situación de adolescentes y niños/as, trabajo infantil.

En el año 2005 Alfredo García, Héctor Ortiz y Malena Solís crearon la asociación “Incrustados en el Manglar”, un grupo de música y baile conformado por los niños y jóvenes entre 5 y 19 años de la isla de Tambillo. Durante más de una década esta agrupación ha alcanzado varios logros a nivel nacional posicionándose entre los representantes de la música de la marimba. Sin embargo este no ha sido un proceso sencillo y la falta de apoyo institucional ha frenado el desarrollo de la agrupación. Actualmente “Incrustados en el Manglar” comparte la sede con la junta parroquial de Tambillo donde realizan sus ensayos cada tarde en la planta baja del lugar.
Actualmente este espacio plantea una serie de dificultades, la construcción de bloque y cemento conforma una habitación de 112 metros cuadrados. Esta área alberga a la banda de música y a los bailarines, quienes en medio de un piso desgastado realizan los ensayos cada tarde. El área no es suficiente y los ensayos deben ajustarse a un espacio interrumpido por columnas, solo pueden practicar durante las noches pues la temperatura en horas del día los sofoca. En medio de estas condiciones los pobladores de Tambillo se reúnen a observar los ensayos, los sitios para observar son pocos, los niños se sientan procurando no estorbar la coreografía, mientras que el resto de público observa desde afuera, agrupándose en las ventanas disponibles.
La comunidad está comprometida con la agrupación y los acompañan en todos sus ensayos. Cada día tanto maestros como jóvenes se esfuerzan para sacar adelante a “Incrustados en el Manglar”.
EL PROYECTO
El diseño del Palenque Cultural Tambillo se hizo en conjunto con la comunidad por medio de talleres participativos e investigación intensiva realizada por Fundación Ochun, Caá Porá arquitectura y Siete86 arquitectos sobre la historia de la cultura afro-ecuatoriana. El gran anhelo y necesitad de la comunidad era la construcción de un espacio que represente su historia cultural y sistemas constructivos. Como arquitectos trabajamos muy duro para entender su legado histórico, aspectos técnicos y significado ceremonial de cada uno de los materiales y configuración espacial.
Realizamos una investigación sobre espacios ceremoniales de la Diáspora Africana y civilizaciones pre coloniales en Camerún, Nigeria, El Congo y otros para entender la configuración especial y usos ceremoniales de materiales de los que se pueden encontrar en Tambillo. Basándonos en esta información trabajamos con ingenieros para diseñar soluciones modernas que se puedan replicar para la construcción del centro cultural.
Los moradores de Tambillo nos permitieron ingresar a sus fincas dentro de los manglares para poder ver los materiales locales que disponen para la construcción.  Para la cimentación se utilizará cadenas de piedra que permiten aislar el suelo pantanoso y salobre. Con esta cimentación se puede alzar la estructura compuesta de madera cuadrada de 15 cm  de nato, laguna y laurel, las juntas de madera son tradicionales y  modernas.  Los muros de 40 cm de grosor se harán con mezclas de distintas tonalidades de tierras locales compactadas y mezcladas con ostiones. La cubierta será tejida de palma real.
El Palenque Cultural Tambillo se expresa en la forma de un centro de baile, una escuela de formación para músicos y bailarines y talleres para la creación de instrumentos musicales. Comprende dos espacios: el área de baile, que es el edificio principal, y las aulas de multiuso y talleres.
El área de baile cumple al papel de “refugio” en las afueras del pueblo generando privacidad. Es el lugar de ensayo y presentación la agrupación “Incrustados en el Manglar”. Se encuentra cerca del manglar y se abre hacia éste, creando un vínculo más estrecho entre lo natural y la expresión artística.
Las aulas y talleres proyectan la arquitectura local. Estos bloques se implantan dejando patios internos entre ellos que apoyan a las actividades internas. Finalmente existe un área de crecimiento donde se prevé el desarrollo del complejo, con una serie de servicios complementarios, como sala de grabación, alojamiento para turistas y cocina, etc. En esta zona de crecimiento se plantea la creación de un vivero durante las primeras etapas de construcción.
Este proyecto es una herramienta para que la agrupación Incrustados en el Manglar amplíe sus objetivos y siga instruyendo y apoyando a los niños y jóvenes de Tambillo en cultivar cultura y saberes ancestrales. La agrupación Incrustados en el Manglar ha impactado a los niños y jóvenes de Tambillo en su comportamiento, entendimiento de su entorno y generando vínculos de hermandad entre sus compañeros.
EL PRESUPUESTO

Esto Proyecto se ha decidido construir en dos fases. El diseño que se recaudara servirá para los materiales que no son accesibles localmente, la transportación de los mismos  y costos de administración. El Gobierno Autónomo Descentralizado de Tambillo ha asumido la responsabilidad de cubrir los costos de mano de obra local de la comunidad. Estos 25 trabajadores y artesanos tendrán un costo de 50mil dólares aproximadamente por los cuatro meses que dure la construcción.
Estamos usando materiales locales lo mas posible para reducir los costos y promover la sensación de pertenencia dentro del pueblo de Tambillo. Adentrarnos a los manglares y fincas de los comuneros ha sido importantes para generar esta sensación de pertenencia con la gente de Tambillo que está involucrada.

RIESGOS Y DESAFÍOS
La construcción de cualquier objeto, especialmente en una zona de difícil acceso, siempre será riesgosa. Algunos de los posibles desafíos que enfrentaremos son un clima variante y húmedo y cierta escases de materiales de construcción y herramientas.
Aun así, buscando prevenir los problemas que se vayan a generar, Caapora y Siete86, estamos preparando rigurosamente la logística del proyecto con meses de anticipación, reservando materiales y herramientas para poder avanzar con las fases previas a la construcción paralelamente con nuestra iniciativa de crowdfunding.
A la vez tratamos de que los voluntarios de la comunidad que participen en la obra del Palenque se reencuentren con técnicas clásicas de construcción para asegurar que las técnicas constructivas usadas en este proyecto puedan a su vez ser replicables en el futuro.
Continuando con nuestra labor participativa nos hemos asociado con artesanos locales cuya experiencia levantando estructuras en la zona apoya a que la construcción del Palenque se desarrolle sin problemas dentro de un marco temporal adecuado.",16.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<strong>ProCare Counseling is a Pro-Active Addiction &amp; Opioid Education Center,</strong> <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">the idea came to me three years ago, while I owned and operated a large, successful pain management practice. This idea began to consume all of my free time until I felt I had to sell my pain clinic, and make ProCare my full-time job. I had no idea how large and important ProCare's Pro-Active Education would be to so many people. It was a great challenge to create this New Company that is dedicated to being Pro-Active about a huge problem in the health care industry.</span>
</h4>
<p>ProCare was designed to give Patient's <strong>Individualized Opioid Education</strong> and <strong>Counseling</strong> and <strong>Provide a Risk Management Package to Physicians</strong> with Signatures of Understandings that will Make the Patient More Responsible for their Opioid therapy, thus Strengthening the Doctors Chart and Lowering the Physician's Risk of Treating that Patient.</p>
<p><strong>Why is it So Difficult to Judge a Good Patient?</strong>  <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Some Patients are at Greater Risk for misuse, abuse, diversion, or addiction than others, but Identifying these Patients can be a Complex Task because there is No Clear Consensus on their Respective Definitions. Most Doctors Agree that Patients who take Opioids are Somewhere in Between: Those who Adhere to Their Treatment regimen and Those who Purposefully Abuse their medications.  On the Assumption that every patient has a degree of risk..... a Universal Precautions Approach is Suggested, beginning with a Thorough Risk Assessment for Every Patient who is prescribed opioids for chronic pain.</span></p>

ProCare Counseling is a Pro-Active Addiction & Opioid Education Center, the idea came to me three years ago, while I owned and operated a large, successful pain management practice. This idea began to consume all of my free time until I felt I had to sell my pain clinic, and make ProCare my full-time job. I had no idea how large and important ProCare's Pro-Active Education would be to so many people. It was a great challenge to create this New Company that is dedicated to being Pro-Active about a huge problem in the health care industry.

ProCare was designed to give Patient's Individualized Opioid Education and Counseling and Provide a Risk Management Package to Physicians with Signatures of Understandings that will Make the Patient More Responsible for their Opioid therapy, thus Strengthening the Doctors Chart and Lowering the Physician's Risk of Treating that Patient.
Why is it So Difficult to Judge a Good Patient?  Some Patients are at Greater Risk for misuse, abuse, diversion, or addiction than others, but Identifying these Patients can be a Complex Task because there is No Clear Consensus on their Respective Definitions. Most Doctors Agree that Patients who take Opioids are Somewhere in Between: Those who Adhere to Their Treatment regimen and Those who Purposefully Abuse their medications.  On the Assumption that every patient has a degree of risk..... a Universal Precautions Approach is Suggested, beginning with a Thorough Risk Assessment for Every Patient who is prescribed opioids for chronic pain.



 The United States has 10 Strategies to Stop the Epidemic, all of the Strategies are Re-Active and Designed to Keep the Bad Patient From Getting Worse....
1. Drug Monitoring 2. Mandatory use of Drug Monitoring 3. Dr. Shopping Law 4. Medicaid Expanded Coverage of Substance Abuse 5. Prescriber Education 6. Good Samaritan Law 7. Support Rescue Drug Use 8. Physical Exam Requirement 9. ID Requirements 10. Pharmacy Lock-in Programs

How do we solve it?
Opioid Education Consists of…..About Opioids, Responsible Use, Opioids while Driving /Pregnant,
Pain Contracts, Opioid Side Effects, Missing a Dose, Signs of Over Dose, Storing Medication, etc....
Pro Active Addiction Counseling Helping your Patients identify issues and concerns before they turn into problems, thus keeping Your Good Patients Compliant Longer.
Signatures of Understandings will Make the Patient More Responsible for their Opioid therapy, thus Strengthening the Doctors Chart and Lowering the Physician's Risk of Treating that Patient.     
The Solution is not being re-active, nor is it controlling the bad patient with 10 Strategies.
The Solution to any Epidemic Begins with Education..... And the Solution is Pro-Active Addiction Counseling and Opioid Education.
Think of Pro Care as the Training Wheels on a bike. These wheels keep the new rider from falling while learning to ride.  Through quarterly visits, ProCare keeps the Good Patients Compliant longer with Opioid Education and One-on-One Pro-Active Addiction Counseling. Pro Care has been test marketed, with over 5000 visits completed.  Please join with us to Make Pro Care the Nation's Solution.

<p><strong><u>Contexte :</u></strong></p>
<p>Une équipe de l’Université du Québec en Outaouais participera à la Simulation des Nations Unies (<strong>National Model United Nations</strong>) qui se déroulera à New York du <strong>18 au 23 mars 2017</strong>. Cette simulation rassemblera plusieurs milliers d’étudiants en provenance du monde entier qui reproduisent, dans un contexte très réaliste, les travaux de l’Assemblée Générale des Nations Unies et de la diplomatie internationale. Les étudiants y participant en reviennent transformés et enrichis de nouvelles perspectives.</p>
<p>Il s'agit d'une opportunité en or pour faire rayonner l'UQO ainsi que l’Outaouais dans le monde entier.</p>
<p><strong><u>Appel à tous :</u></strong></p>
<p>Nous faisons appel à vous afin d’amasser des fonds pour nous permettre de vivre cette expérience. Certains facteurs font en sorte que la collecte de fonds est plus difficile que les autres années puisque, entre autres, le <strong>taux de change avec le dollar des États-Unis est très désavantageux</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><u>Mandat :</u></strong></p>
<p>Cette année, l’UQO représente le Honduras, un petit pays d’Amérique Centrale. Nous travaillerons sur divers comités rattachés à l’Assemblée générale de l’ONU. Nous traiterons de <strong>plusieurs sujets d’actualité</strong> en plus de chercher des <strong>solutions innovatrices</strong>, tels le rôle des femmes dans le maintien de la paix, la pauvreté, les désastres naturels, le développement durable, l’accès à l’éducation, le commerce illégal et les déchets nucléaires.</p>
<p><strong><u>Frais :</u></strong></p>
<p>Les frais pour ce voyage s’élèvent à environ <strong>15 500 $.</strong> Ce montant inclut l’inscription à l’activité, le logement et le transport à New York. Le taux de change n’est pas à notre avantage en ce moment; ce qui fait en sorte que le défi est d’autant plus grand pour réunir cette somme.</p>
<p>Grâce à nos généreux donateurs, les associations étudiantes, les modules, le Décanat des études de l’UQO, la Fondation Desjardins et plus, nous avons jusqu’à présent amassé plus de <strong>6000 $.</strong> Nous sommes encore à 9000 $ de notre rêve!</p>
<p>Plusieurs d’entre nous sommes dans une situation financière précaire. Votre soutien va permettre ainsi à toute notre délégation de se déplacer pour cette opportunité unique qui autrement aurait été inabordable. Votre contribution pourrait ainsi transformer nos opportunités de carrière et nos vies.</p>
<p><strong><u>En guise de remerciement : </u></strong></p>
<p>En guise de remerciement pour les dons que nous recevrons, nous offrirons, pour tous les dons, notre immense gratitude. Pour tous les dons de <strong>25$</strong> et plus, une <strong>carte postale</strong> de New York signée par la délégation complète. Pour les dons de <strong>50$</strong> et plus, nous publierons une <strong>vidéo</strong> sur notre page Facebook vous remerciant publiquement de votre don. </p>
<p><br/>Ce n’est pas tout! Vous connaissez un <strong>talent</strong> caché chez l’un de nos délégués qui mériterait d’être dévoilé? Vous voulez nous mettre au défi? Laissez aller votre imagination et regroupez vos dons pour ajouter du piquant à cette collecte de fonds. Envoyez-nous vos défis à s.a.lemieux@hotmail.com.

<p>Hey everybody! My name is Pete Welty and I'm the President of Cyrus Foundation, an educational nonprofit organization. It was about five years ago, I was between jobs and a friend of mine who owned a small music store with a thriving lessons program invited me to teach guitar. I loved it! It was so fun building relationships with these awesome young people and I discovered that our relationship was much more than ""guitar teacher/guitar student"", it was more of a mentoring role with these bright kids. I soon discovered that my friend's lessons program had been almost twice the size just a few years before but was now seeing dramatic decline. He also told me that as the schools were dropping more and more of their music programs, there was still a strong desire from kids and their parents to learn music. However, after the economic recession of 2008, fewer and fewer families could afford private music lessons. I began to do some research on the benefits of a music education and was overwhelmed with what I found. Students who learn music actually develop their brains in a unique and very beneficial way. Watch our video to learn more about that.</p>
<p>Having a background with nonprofits I suggested that we start a nonprofit organization so that we could build up a scholarship program for families that could no longer afford lessons or perhaps could never afford lessons before without some kind of financial assistance.</p>
<p>My friend has offered to sell his music shop and lessons program to us for HALF its estimated value so that we can run the entire enterprise under the nonprofit company. Therefore, all proceeds from the music store will now go to the scholarship fund.</p>
<p>A few years ago we were able to build a really great little recording studio right next door to the shop, so we can now offer lessons in recording, producing and mixing to those who are interested in that aspect of the music business.</p>
<p>I am joined in these efforts by my two partners, Ralph Burnett and Peter Johnson. Ralph is in charge of the recording studio where he will not only teach recording arts and composition to students but also establishing a record label and publishing company so that artists and students can share and promote their music with the proceeds going to the scholarship fund as well. Ralph is a Music Supervisor and Composer for Television and Film and former Products Manager of MCA Records/ Universal Music in L.A., and brings a great deal of knowledge about the music industry to our company. Peter is our business mind. With a successful background in business, he is also a musician and a songwriter and has found that our vision is one he can get behind passionately and has dedicated this chapter of his career to it.</p>
<p>Today we are attempting to raise $50,000.00 to get our vision off the ground and really moving. This money will be used as follows:</p>
<p>1. $20,000.00 to pay off the purchase of existing program.</p>
<p>2. $10,000.00 to go immediately into the scholarship fund.</p>
<p>3. $10,000.00 to seed ongoing fundraising efforts.</p>
<p>4. $7,000.00 to purchase  much needed instruments and equipment for our students to begin learning and sharing their music.</p>
<p>5. $3,000.00 to pay money owed to talented and goodhearted professionals who have helped us with their expertise to this point, deferring payment until we raise the funds.</p>
<p>NOW...PLEASE KEEP READING! This is NOT an effort to launch a program in one location here in Auburn/Grass Valley CA. It is the beginning of a movement! We intend to create something that can be replicated anywhere there is the need.  Our goal is to open three locations within our first two years. From there...? the sky's the limit. We see this program in communities all over the US and beyond. While cultures and governments may not place a high value on music education, WE DO! And we know that you do as well. Please give as generously as you can today to help get this much needed program the start it deserves.</p>

But this grimy image we’ve been taught is far from the truth. Most addictions are hard to spot and can go unnoticed for many years. Having dealt with this first-hand I felt it important to shine a light on the matter because if untreated, or ignored, it can lead to unpredictable circumstances.Behind the scene images when we shot the ""mind"" scenes HowThe project features three 360° films that follow characters based on real stories and portray how addictions can come about and what the signs of addictions are. The films are also accompanied by an informative “extra” film that explores the topic in more depth correlating back to the three films. The way the films are shot was also an experimental VR technique which uses stills shot stitched together to form 360 image and transformed into a moving image.  The timeline of my MA project MA studiesI created this project for my Masters study but it has become something much more personal to me. Because of the emotional commitment I’ve put in, I want to make this as professionally as possible. The end goal for this project is to become a free educational tool for schools to show to 14-18 year olds and open the discussion surrounding the topic. I’ve self-funded the project up to this point, selling my things on a flea market to pay both for tuition and the initial production cost, but what this project needs is just one final push to reach the end goal and for that I need your help.Mockup for how final version looks without VR headsets  AddactionI have partnered up with a charity called Addaction and the aim is to publish a dedicated app that can be used on any smartphone. We have a working prototype that I built myself but there is cost of publishing an official app. Accompanying the app I want to create custom VR Cardboard viewers to allow better immersion and help bring VR to more people. Lastly, I want to use the funding for marketing since there is no point trying to help if no one know that the project exists. Challenges so farI’ve had to teach myself to become a film editor, director, sound technician and many other skills.

Some 2 millions souls were murdered under the bloody regime of the Khmer Rouge - 2 millions lives stolen in the most horrific way, women, children, elderly…A less known fact was the Khmer Rouge's policy of systematic extermination of all forms of religious, cultural and traditional legacy, killing 90% of artists dancers, musiciens, historians.  It is in this distressing context that our story began, in a few villages around the temple of Banteay Srei, which were still in 1999 under the control of the Khmer Rouge, in the heart of the Khmer cultural heritage site of Angkor – a UNESCO World Heritage Site. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This is how it all started----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our story centres around the determination of a woman called Ravynn Karet-Coxen, who after two decades in exile in Europe, had decided to go back to her homeland to contribute during the reconstruction from this unspeakable tragedy. In 1994 Ravynn set up in London, where she lives, the  Foundation Nginn Karet for Cambodia (www.nkfc.org), travelling twice a year to Cambodia to identify where the most contribution was needed. She journeyed through the countryside trying to figure out how and where to help, and organised 2 major fundraising events: 1999 in London, and 2000 in New York where  she gathered enough funds, 1 million American dollars, to begin the sustainable work in the 14 chosen villages in the heart of the Khmer cultural heritage of Angkor where the population were the most deprived and in a deep psychological distress.In 1999 when it all started, some of the villages were still under the control of the Khmer Rouge and for the first 6 months had to work under curfew. Eighteen years later her gamble has surpassed all her hopes, deploying all the energy, strength and determination, without a day of rest, nor a stress free night, hand in hand with the local authorities, villagers and her wonderful staff, NKFC managed to bring 2868 families (around 20,000 people) of the 14 villages of the District of Banteay Srei  to a dignified and sustainable livelihood. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The birth of the Sacred Dancers of Angkor---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In 2007, the first rural Khmer traditional dance and music school saw light. In a country still traumatised by the extermination of those who carried the  cultural knowledge transmitted orally, where the scars of the genocide perpetuated by the Khmer Rouges are still palpable in the mutilated souls. The creation of this traditional dance and music school has proven to be an important psychological healing factor reconciling the  families with their traditions and cultural values.In Cambodia, dance is neither a mere discipline nor is it entertainment. It is a timeless language that flows in the Cambodian veins, nourishing the souls of the people, it is a means to communicate with the Gods, celebrating them and thanking them.The Conservatoire of dance and music was a turning point to the Foundation as they discovered that all their previous efforts just improved physical being -  homes, crops, water supply, hygiene but still the eyes were empty, stone cold like beads. The medium of music and dance revived buried strengths and the memories of their cultural knowledge which were punished by death penalties during the Khmer Rouge period. It slowly liberated them from the state of limbo that they were forced to adopt for their own survival. Fitting to their profile of humble artists born and trained in the sacred land around their temple - a spiritual dimension was added to their curriculum of classical, folk and traditional music to give them a specific identity. All the artists piously meditate and pray daily before their trainings for the Peace in the World and the Welfare of Children beside dedicating rituals to reinstate the spiritual energy in the temples as well as profound rites for the souls of horrendrous devastation in the World. In ten years of daily training, five days a week, six hours per day, learning, repeating rehearsing and refining the most incredible and rare full length repertoires of the classical ballet, the Sacred Dancers of Angkor are accomplished artists mastering also the folk dance and traditional music. An extraordinary achievement from children who 10 years ago did not know what dance was about. The unique talent and spiritual dedication of the Sacred Dancers of Angkor has gained the support of His Majesty King Sihamoni and the Patronage of HRH Princess Buppha Devi, legendary Prima Ballerina and Cambodian Living legend of Dance.  In the last 10 years the dancers and musicians have dedicated spiritual rites in 32 major Angkorian temples - as far as Was Phou in Laos; have performed in United States from East to West to marvelled audiences; received standing ovations and soon will be going to Japan. The Sacred Dancers of Angkor built its credentials in the strength and energy transmitted to bring Peace in the World through their daily dedication. It is  through the power and concentration of meditation and prayer that each of the artists is piously sending messages around the World.  The charismatic illumination of the Sacred Dancers is slowly gaining recognition around the world, triggering many demands to see them perform .----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The survival of the Sacred Dancers of Angkor----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Their Conservatoire of Dance and Music is located one hour by  car from Siem Reap, near the temple of Banteay Srei in the Angkor archeological Park where visiting hours are strictly controlled. In 2015, despite a growing popularity and an increased radiance the Conservatoire was hit by a perilous situation due to its rural location far away from the heart of Siem Reap town where all visitors stay after a whole day of visit in the Angkor Park. The artists born and trained there face a dilemma. After 10 years of daily training, now young adults many are obliged to find a means to survive and help support their destitute large families by earning dangerously and unsafely in brick factories, construction sites, fields and even illegally in Thailand as low paid workers. Ravynn, far from being disconcerted, is trying,  as she always has done for the last 20 years, to find a solution. She has envisioned a little theatre in the heart of the town of Siem Reap easily accessible to all visitors eager to discover the unique talent of passionate and dedicated artists but also to share the authentic delicate beauty of the dance legacy.This proposal is closely linked on the survival and the sustainability of the troupe It is where they would introduce and share the most authentic legacy of the classical dance.

<h3><strong>Summary</strong></h3>
<p>Morgan O'Hara is a visual artist based in New York City. In January 2017, a time of stark political change in the United States, O'Hara felt the need to do something connected to her art practice which also addressed her political concerns and offered a sense of empowerment and encouragement to the community. Her practice of hand copying the Constitution of the United States - a document that is meant to protect the basic human rights of all American people - provided focus. Through hand copying, the writer absorbs information experientially, making room for reflection, new realizations, and an embodied understanding of the text. When done as a community, a sense of collaboration surfaces and nourishes.</p>
<p>HANDWRITING THE CONSTITUTION is not about learning by rote, but participation through writing. It is not about efficiency, but about taking time to contemplate meaning through the simple act of handwriting. As the writing flows, each person's gestures and choices give new form to the text, aligning the project with an art practice. It is also a social practice, a gathering in a public place for a collective effort. This project exists so people can know their rights, and resist negative thinking.</p>
<p>This project is not only intended for people in the United States. <i>The Universal Declaration of Human Rights</i> was hand copied in an O'Hara exhibition in Taipei, Taiwan in April and May of 2017, and she will hand write <i>The Magna Carta</i> in Dublin, Ireland in 2018. It is the intention of this project to involve as many people as possible to discover and handwrite documents that protect the basic human rights of all people. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>We are looking to fundraise $30,000 for:</p>
<p>- rental of space in which to work</p>
<p>- website hosting</p>
<p>- designer's work on the website <a href=""http://www.handwritingtheconstitution.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.handwritingtheconstitution.com</a></p>
<p>- website maintenance</p>
<p>- documentation of handwriting sessions (photo and video)</p>
<p>- outreach, daily correspondence, and collecting feedback from collaborators</p>
<p>- generation of national and international visibility, including writing press releases, interviews, and social media </p>
<p>Up to this point, we have volunteered time and skills, such as video and photo documentation, the design of invitations to handwriting sessions, gathering materials for sessions, researching human rights documents, and organizing handwriting sessions. We'd like to continue these efforts in order to bring this project to as many people as possible and, of course, the rent must be paid.</p>
<p>If we do not reach our entire goal, we will continue to the best of our ability. At its most basic, a handwriting session is simple and inexpensive: a few copies of the document being handwritten, paper, pens, and a group of people who decide to give their time to experience an important document. The time consuming aspect of the project is administrative. </p>

<p>$5000 Morgan will go to your town, give a lecture on the project, and organize a handwriting session in your place of choice</p>
<p>$30,000 Own a complete original handwritten copy of the Constitution done by Morgan O'Hara, approximately 10 handwritten pages on handmade paper.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>The process of HANDWRITING THE CONSTITUTION is transformative. It generates calm in the face of a daily bombardment from the news channels and social media. Clarity and peace of mind are essential to rational thought and decisive action and this process has been very useful in this regard. If you look at the website we created <a href=""http://www.handwritingtheconstitution.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.handwritingtheconstitution.com</a> under COLLABORATOR STATEMENTS you will get an idea of the impact the process has had on other individuals. What kind of impact will it have on you? There is only one way to find out.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3>
<p>The biggest risk or obstacle is that the project will diminish in scope rather than grow, simply because of limited resources for covering rent and professional services. Eventually it could turn back into one person at a table HANDWRITING THE CONSTITUTION as a solo activity. That wouldn't be bad, but it would be much better if the process and inspiration the practice generates would spread and more people would participate. The more cognizant we are of our rights as citizens, the more prepared we will be to recognize and act if these rights are threatened. If many of us are aware, the atmosphere can only improve.</p>
<p>We did not anticipate that putting HANDWRITING THE CONSTITUTION together would create such national enthusiasm. It was recently featured in the <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/30/opinion/sunday/the-constitution-by-hand.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">New York Times</a>, the <a href=""http://primolevicenter.org/printed-matter/devising-resistance/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Primo Levi Institute</a>, <a href=""https://news.artnet.com/art-world/morgan-ohara-handwriting-constitution-1018610?utm_content=from_&amp;utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=NYC%20newsletter%20for%207/13/17&amp;utm_term=New%20US%20Newsletter%20List"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Art Net</a>, and <a href=""http://observer.com/2017/07/independence-day-us-constitution/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The New York Observer</a>. Letters and emails arrive daily describing collaborators initiating their own handwriting sessions across the country. It is of course, wonderful that the idea generates interest and a desire to participate, but the time it takes to manage all of this and to make it grow is considerable. It has become a full time commitment and we still need to pay living expenses, rent, and professional services to keep it going. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>1. Organize a HANDWRITING THE CONSTITUTION session in your town and send a few good images to handwritingtheconstitution@gmail.com</p>
<p>2. Write a few paragraphs about your take on the value of HANDWRITING THE CONSTITUTION</p>
<p>3. Get your local newspaper to post an article about the project</p>
<p>4. Use Indiegogo tools to promote the project</p>

The Impact
The process of HANDWRITING THE CONSTITUTION is transformative. It generates calm in the face of a daily bombardment from the news channels and social media. Clarity and peace of mind are essential to rational thought and decisive action and this process has been very useful in this regard. If you look at the website we created www.handwritingtheconstitution.com under COLLABORATOR STATEMENTS you will get an idea of the impact the process has had on other individuals. What kind of impact will it have on you? There is only one way to find out.
 
Risks & Challenges
The biggest risk or obstacle is that the project will diminish in scope rather than grow, simply because of limited resources for covering rent and professional services. Eventually it could turn back into one person at a table HANDWRITING THE CONSTITUTION as a solo activity. That wouldn't be bad, but it would be much better if the process and inspiration the practice generates would spread and more people would participate. The more cognizant we are of our rights as citizens, the more prepared we will be to recognize and act if these rights are threatened. If many of us are aware, the atmosphere can only improve.
We did not anticipate that putting HANDWRITING THE CONSTITUTION together would create such national enthusiasm. It was recently featured in the New York Times, the Primo Levi Institute, Art Net, and The New York Observer. Letters and emails arrive daily describing collaborators initiating their own handwriting sessions across the country. It is of course, wonderful that the idea generates interest and a desire to participate, but the time it takes to manage all of this and to make it grow is considerable. It has become a full time commitment and we still need to pay living expenses, rent, and professional services to keep it going. 
 
Other Ways You Can Help
1. Organize a HANDWRITING THE CONSTITUTION session in your town and send a few good images to handwritingtheconstitution@gmail.com
2. Write a few paragraphs about your take on the value of HANDWRITING THE CONSTITUTION
3. Get your local newspaper to post an article about the project
4. Use Indiegogo tools to promote the project

Papua New Guinea was an Australian colony until 1975 and its school system is still heavily influenced by Australian models. Schools teach in English and while an effort is made to teach topics common to all Papua New Guineans, the many distinct tribal and local cultures remain invisible at school. </span></p><p style=""text-align: right;"">When you went to school, you probably read books about your own people, your own country, and your own culture. They were probably in the same language your parents, grandparents, and neighbours spoke. But when young Nalik children go to school, they see books in English, usually from another country, and talking about ways of life that are very different from their own.

Using stories from their parents, grandparents, clan matriarchs, and clan chiefs, they wrote about the birds in their local environment and what they mean to people there. Some stories were told by clan chiefs and female elders. Children listened to the stories, translated them into English, and drew pictures that eventually became part of the book. Children also asked their parents and grandparents for stories, legends, and information about birds. They worked in groups to retell these stories in English. We have gathered the stories and illustrations into a book: <i>A Maani, Birds and Nalik Culture</i>.

Besides being home to 5% of the world’s biodiversity, its 6.5 million people speak over 800 separate languages, about 12% of the world’s total.This incredible diversity is not reflected in the schools. Papua New Guinea was an Australian colony until 1975 and its school system is still heavily influenced by Australian models. Schools teach in English and while an effort is made to teach topics common to all Papua New Guineans, the many distinct tribal and local cultures remain invisible at school. When you went to school, you probably read books about your own people, your own country, and your own culture. They were probably in the same language your parents, grandparents, and neighbours spoke. But when young Nalik children go to school, they see books in English, usually from another country, and talking about ways of life that are very different from their own. There are no books talking about the culture of their ancestors. A Maani: Birds and Nalik Culture is an attempt to address the imbalance and show that the local culture has an important place in the education of young Papua New Guineans.

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>I have been working as a teacher for 20 years and have always been interested in tradition and culture and what makes a community.    The aim of this project is to found a place within the local community that gives space to locals to share both within the  community and further afield.   Having organised a few events, where local crafts such a lace making, music and different types of art are involved, I have discovered that there is no set place in which these events can happen.  It is therefore my wish to create such a place that will not only benefit the local community but improve it by bringing a possible tourist attraction to the area. </p>
<p><strong>Why this area?</strong></p>
<p>The area is rich in tradition and local crafts many of which are dying out.  By opening such a centre new life will be brought to the area and thus offering the opportunity for local economic growth and a re awakening and interest in the crafts that made a community. Not letting crafts that are dying out die and bring opportunities for new crafts to be taught and organised, will bring life and interest back to the area.  </p>
<p><strong>What will the money be used for?</strong></p>
<p>The funding required is to purchase a local building and fund the outfitting to be suitable to be used as a teaching area and as a centre for tourists to come and learn local Italian crafts and traditions, take part in art classes and music courses.   Part of the rewards that are to be offered include free courses, pieces of art work by local artists depicting the area and its natural rural beauty.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the full funds are not raised the money will be used to fund a smaller community project also based around the arts and crafts of the area.  </p>
<p><strong>What is in place so far?</strong></p>
<p>Through a network of local friends and colleagues I already have offers to hold classes and events, but we need a place to hold them.   A local architect has offered his services for free should the sum be raised and a builder at cost. </p>
<p><strong>Last thoughts</strong></p>
<p>Ever wished you had listened to or watched more what your grandmother did? Now is your chance not to let other people loose that opportunity too. Everyone can help, no matter how small, every little helps whether you can contribute or help by sharing this project with friends who maybe be able to help.  </p>

This room is dirty, dusty, full of clutter. In fact, the dirt is so substantial that the windows in the room are completely and totally covered in grime, so much so that no light from the outside is able to enter the room. Outside the room, the sun is beginning to rise. A beautiful sunrise is quickly developing.  Your friend has never seen a sunrise.  What would you do to show the beauty of the developing sunrise to your friend?  Clean the window! Cleaning the window would allow your friend the ability to see a sunrise for the first time. But the grime is so thick that cleaning the window takes time.  At first, your friend is only able to see a gradual brightening in the room.  Then little bits of orange colored light begin to shine through.  As you clean, more and more of the beautiful sight outside becomes visible and the beauty of the sunrise becomes reality for your friend.</p><p>All people have been locked in the room of sin since the Garden of Eden. The outside world, with the sunrise in all it’s glory, is an unknown to those who haven’t met the God of the Bible, known through Jesus. They know nothing of the reality of God’s reign through Christ in the world and in their lives. As those who have come to know the love of God and his reign in our lives, we have the ability, even the responsibility, to clean the windows.  In doing so, we give others a vision, an experience, of what the reign of God is all about.  We both demonstrate and announce the reign of God through Christ.  We are in no way adding to or helping the reign of God into existence.  The sunrise exists in all it’s glory regardless of our action. However, we have the wonderful opportunity to reveal that kingdom, the reign of God, the love of God, in the lives of people. </p><p>The window washing analogy first became part of my own story when attending Wikiconference 2013, a gathering of missional church leaders organized by the Five-Two organization of Katy, Texas. </p><p>What I learned and experienced while at this event, along with other stories of the missional work of God through His people, gave me the words to verbalize a new calling in my life and how I envision living out that call.</p><p>As I look back, I can see God working for years to start a fire for missional service in me.</p><p>I had failed to recognize it, until recently. </p><p><br/></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p><p></p>

This room is dirty, dusty, full of clutter. In fact, the dirt is so substantial that the windows in the room are completely and totally covered in grime, so much so that no light from the outside is able to enter the room. Outside the room, the sun is beginning to rise. A beautiful sunrise is quickly developing.  Your friend has never seen a sunrise.  What would you do to show the beauty of the developing sunrise to your friend?  Clean the window! Cleaning the window would allow your friend the ability to see a sunrise for the first time. But the grime is so thick that cleaning the window takes time.  At first, your friend is only able to see a gradual brightening in the room.  Then little bits of orange colored light begin to shine through.  As you clean, more and more of the beautiful sight outside becomes visible and the beauty of the sunrise becomes reality for your friend.All people have been locked in the room of sin since the Garden of Eden. The outside world, with the sunrise in all it’s glory, is an unknown to those who haven’t met the God of the Bible, known through Jesus. They know nothing of the reality of God’s reign through Christ in the world and in their lives. As those who have come to know the love of God and his reign in our lives, we have the ability, even the responsibility, to clean the windows.  In doing so, we give others a vision, an experience, of what the reign of God is all about.  We both demonstrate and announce the reign of God through Christ.  We are in no way adding to or helping the reign of God into existence.  The sunrise exists in all it’s glory regardless of our action. However, we have the wonderful opportunity to reveal that kingdom, the reign of God, the love of God, in the lives of people. The window washing analogy first became part of my own story when attending Wikiconference 2013, a gathering of missional church leaders organized by the Five-Two organization of Katy, Texas. What I learned and experienced while at this event, along with other stories of the missional work of God through His people, gave me the words to verbalize a new calling in my life and how I envision living out that call.As I look back, I can see God working for years to start a fire for missional service in me.I had failed to recognize it, until recently. 
For the past four summers, I served as a part of the leadership team for an event called UKANDU Chicago, a mission trip where teens and adults serve schools, churches, non-profit organizations, and individuals in inner-city Chicago.  As a member of the leadership team, I learned what is involved in assisting people with a variety of needs and I gained valuable skills in organizing and leading short and long-term service projects.

It was a beautiful August day and we decided to meet at the playground of a school near their home, located in the Hamline-Midway neighborhood.  As I was sitting there waiting for our friend to arrive and our kids were getting settled into playing on the playground, I had a clear sense that God was telling me, in a nearly audible voice, “Come here and do mission.  This is your mission field.”And yet, I still had no sense of what mission work in the Frogtown and Midway neighborhoods of Saint Paul would look like.  Until attending Wikiconference 2013.

</h1><h1>Systems</h1><h3>
<br/>    As is growing more evident by the media coverage that most Americans 
view daily, along with the rest of the world, and is spread through Facebook, Youtube as well as a multitude of 
other media avenues, there is a need. A need for the ability to hold 
people, all people, accountable for their actions. How many incidents 
have been brought to light because someone used video to expose what 
happened? How many more have been swept under the rug because no one had a video? Videos are only good if there is one. What do you do when you 
don't have one? What happens when the proof you are recording gets 
destroyed or deleted? To answer that question we must first answer this...<br/>
</h3><h3><br/></h3><h3>
<b>What is a Guardian?</b>
</h3><br/>   <i>Simply put, it is battery powered truth. It is a witness when no one else hears or sees. It is the ability to discern fact from fiction when taking the word of the right side of an argument means the difference between justice and an atrocity against you or a loved one. One of our devices is piece of mind when everything seems to be going haywire.</i><br/><br/>  That's the cliche answer.<br/><br/>   The more practical answer is a Guardian Device is one of several types of specialized recording and transmitting devices being developed by Praetorian Guardian Systems especially designed to be easily usable on a moments notice, secure from tampering or erasing and concealed from casual observation even when in plain sight.<br/><br/>   Get stopped in any small town in America and see how many rights you have in their local court or how much stock they place in what you know to be truth.<br/><br/>   Stand before any judge in a divorce and see how honest and ethical you're ex and their attorney turn out to be.<br/><br/>   Watch someone fake a fall in your business or crash into your car on the road and see what they really don't have to prove to run you broke in a he said she said contest. The insurance company just wants the cheapest way out. They will have no qualms throwing you under the bus.<br/><br/>   Even eye witnesses who honestly believe they saw an event accurately can easily be mistaken. It happens all the time. But without more potent evidence than just your testimony, what they think they saw IS what happened once it gets to court.<br/>  <br/>   Neighbors, friends or family call the police and lie about the other party? If you have ever had or seen this done then you know how hard such lies are to disprove without evidence.<br/><br/>   Events such as these are in the news every day but only when they are caught in the act.<br/><br/>   You also know how much negative impact such lies have, even if you manage to win in court later. Loosing because you can't prove a lie was told about you is beyond frustrating. It is often a terrible, life changing event. <br/><br/>   Are you willing to trust the city employed police, prosecutor and judge to protect your rights? Do recall how much of every city's yearly budget is provided by their courts collecting fines and court costs from people just like you.<br/>  <br/>   Worse, what if those same cops beat or abuse you, can you prove THEY are the criminal, and not YOU?<br/>   <br/>   These are but a few of the myriad examples of why someone might lie to or about you.<br/><br/>                                                People lie for one main reason.<br/><br/>                                                                  <b> IT WORKS.</b><br/><br/><br/>   Most people do not go through life prepared to PROVE THEIR INNOCENCE. That is precisely why the presumption of innocence exists. Most people are not able to catch and prove a lie they never saw coming. They only catch it once it is too late to prove it. But with a Guardian unit you can prove the truth. Don't be next.<br/><br/>   The greatest benefit of a Guardian Device is simply this. It can be used on your person, in your home, in your car or anywhere you choose without anyone else ever knowing; and right in front of those who would choose to lie or act in a way that would otherwise be very harmful to you.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2><b>Here is What We Need Right Now &amp; What You Get for Contributing</b></h2><br/>Let us break it down in detail:<br/><br/><b>Current Goal:</b> Our current funding goal is $25,000 USD. These funds will be used to pay for preparing the utility patent (we currently have a provisional patent in the works), cover testing and required FCC certification as well as provide outside consulting to finalize out aesthetic designs for both the bases, basic peripherals and complete system integration with certified components. There is also a small amount built into this budget to cover additional miscellaneous expenses related to these goals that invariably arise. If you want people to be held accountable as much as we do, we will fly by this funding goal and go In Demand and beyond to make this product commonplace!<br/><br/>     We are hoping through your support to not only expedite our project's completion, but to get you excited about changing how people protect themselves from liars and wrongdoers in addition to gauging just how much you, the Guardian Family, want these products to come to market. If this is something you believe the world needs, give what you can and tell everyone about it. <b>Make some noise!</b><p><br/></p><p><b>Stretch Goals:</b> We have a number of stretch goals to implement in the event that this campaign is as successful as we feel it will be. These goals will be lined out in greater detail as we move along with the campaign, but here is the basic plan.<br/><br/></p><p>Stretch Goal #1: $75,000 USD. By reaching this goal, will will begin to offer pre-orders on additional styles of Guardian recording systems for planned delivery estimated as summer of 2017. These funds will facilitate production and alpha testing of a DFM model and development of a smartphone and tablet app to control and download our systems remotely.</p><p><br/></p><p>Stretch Goal #2: $165,000 USD. Once we reach this funding goal, we will begin the production of injection molds and other tooling for mass manufacturing, purchase materials for this purpose, and begin the process of making these available to the public. Delivery is estimated at December 2016.</p><p><br/></p><p>Stretch Goal #3: $285,000 USD. At this funding goal we will be able to hire additional personnel to speed and expand product development. This will allow for several addition types of peripherals to be included in our first run production and bring the production to a more rapid realization, estimated as summer 2016.</p><p><br/></p><p>Stretch Goal #4: $450,000 USD. This would be a huge cry for accountability and an unprecedented mandate for our product to become a reality.  Reaching this goal will allow us to expand our efforts in the accountability movement to areas beyond just building an awesome product. At this level of support from you, the Guardian Family, we will open our planned non-profit wing with functions geared toward bringing about new accountability laws, helping our least advantaged clients receive devices at little to no cost, rights and accountability education programs and providing legal support for those facing accountability issues in the courts. We also want to hear from you what actions you would like to see taken in this arena, so email us, or hit us up of Facebook!</p><p>    As you can see, the more money we can raise the faster that this becomes a reality. Help us to help you protect yourself and your loved ones faster! <br/><br/><b>Perks for Now and Later:</b> Our early perks will give you some very useful informational booklets, several unique shirts and other neat tangibles, but more importantly you get all the updates offering new perks and first dibs on upgrades and additional products to pre-order as we reach each goal in our funding! </p><p>As we reach each goal, we will post many new and awesome perks, with a number of them being big discounts or pre-orders on additional peripherals and devices. </p><p>For example, when we reach Stretch Goal #1, we will begin offering perks that give contributors the opportunity to order expanded systems at a discount of 10-15% first. Exact discount numbers will depend on final funding levels. More funding will allow for larger discounts. </p><p>At Stretch Goal #3 we will post another perk giving contributors a wholesale package for extended systems to either use, or resale at any price they set. <br/><br/><br/></p><h3>Known Risks and Possible Challenges:  </h3><div>   </div>While every endeavor has an element of risk, we are committed to minimizing the risks we ask contributors to bear. There are always possible delays in any manufacturing process, and some regulatory hurdles left to jump. We are using all off the shelf, known to function components and are really not inventing any new technology. It's all stuff that already works, we are just putting it together in a very new and different way than anything available today. This greatly reduces the risk factors because everything we are combining already works in other applications.<br/>   <br/>  We have a very dedicated team of people with a wide range of skills to cover most possible contingencies. They have real world experience as well as the drive to recognize any challenge we may not have the skill set to overcome so we can find the right people to do just that. We have studied many other campaigns and manufacturing stories of technology products to see what challenges they faced and found ways to beat most of those before we will run into them. This being said we have built in extra delivery time to allow us to be on or ahead of schedule in a real world production environment.<div></div><br/><br/><b>If We Don't Reach Our Goal:</b> We feel sure we will reach our goal and well beyond with this campaign. However, we are not clairvoyant and anything is possible, so that may not happen. If we don't reach our initial goal, we will spend first on perk fulfillment, and all remaining funds will go toward the process of bringing our system to market. Our estimated time for perk fulfillment is Dec. 2017.

Systems
    As is growing more evident by the media coverage that most Americans 
view daily, along with the rest of the world, and is spread through Facebook, Youtube as well as a multitude of 
other media avenues, there is a need. A need for the ability to hold 
people, all people, accountable for their actions. How many incidents 
have been brought to light because someone used video to expose what 
happened? How many more have been swept under the rug because no one had a video? Videos are only good if there is one. What do you do when you 
don't have one? What happens when the proof you are recording gets 
destroyed or deleted? To answer that question we must first answer this...

What is a Guardian?
   Simply put, it is battery powered truth. It is a witness when no one else hears or sees. It is the ability to discern fact from fiction when taking the word of the right side of an argument means the difference between justice and an atrocity against you or a loved one. One of our devices is piece of mind when everything seems to be going haywire.  That's the cliche answer.   The more practical answer is a Guardian Device is one of several types of specialized recording and transmitting devices being developed by Praetorian Guardian Systems especially designed to be easily usable on a moments notice, secure from tampering or erasing and concealed from casual observation even when in plain sight.   Get stopped in any small town in America and see how many rights you have in their local court or how much stock they place in what you know to be truth.   Stand before any judge in a divorce and see how honest and ethical you're ex and their attorney turn out to be.   Watch someone fake a fall in your business or crash into your car on the road and see what they really don't have to prove to run you broke in a he said she said contest. The insurance company just wants the cheapest way out. They will have no qualms throwing you under the bus.   Even eye witnesses who honestly believe they saw an event accurately can easily be mistaken. It happens all the time. But without more potent evidence than just your testimony, what they think they saw IS what happened once it gets to court.     Neighbors, friends or family call the police and lie about the other party? If you have ever had or seen this done then you know how hard such lies are to disprove without evidence.   Events such as these are in the news every day but only when they are caught in the act.   You also know how much negative impact such lies have, even if you manage to win in court later. Loosing because you can't prove a lie was told about you is beyond frustrating. It is often a terrible, life changing event.    Are you willing to trust the city employed police, prosecutor and judge to protect your rights? Do recall how much of every city's yearly budget is provided by their courts collecting fines and court costs from people just like you.     Worse, what if those same cops beat or abuse you, can you prove THEY are the criminal, and not YOU?      These are but a few of the myriad examples of why someone might lie to or about you.                                                People lie for one main reason.                                                                   IT WORKS.   Most people do not go through life prepared to PROVE THEIR INNOCENCE. That is precisely why the presumption of innocence exists. Most people are not able to catch and prove a lie they never saw coming. They only catch it once it is too late to prove it. But with a Guardian unit you can prove the truth. Don't be next.   The greatest benefit of a Guardian Device is simply this. It can be used on your person, in your home, in your car or anywhere you choose without anyone else ever knowing; and right in front of those who would choose to lie or act in a way that would otherwise be very harmful to you.Here is What We Need Right Now & What You Get for ContributingLet us break it down in detail:Current Goal: Our current funding goal is $25,000 USD. These funds will be used to pay for preparing the utility patent (we currently have a provisional patent in the works), cover testing and required FCC certification as well as provide outside consulting to finalize out aesthetic designs for both the bases, basic peripherals and complete system integration with certified components. There is also a small amount built into this budget to cover additional miscellaneous expenses related to these goals that invariably arise. If you want people to be held accountable as much as we do, we will fly by this funding goal and go In Demand and beyond to make this product commonplace!     We are hoping through your support to not only expedite our project's completion, but to get you excited about changing how people protect themselves from liars and wrongdoers in addition to gauging just how much you, the Guardian Family, want these products to come to market. If this is something you believe the world needs, give what you can and tell everyone about it. Make some noise!Stretch Goals: We have a number of stretch goals to implement in the event that this campaign is as successful as we feel it will be. These goals will be lined out in greater detail as we move along with the campaign, but here is the basic plan.Stretch Goal #1: $75,000 USD. By reaching this goal, will will begin to offer pre-orders on additional styles of Guardian recording systems for planned delivery estimated as summer of 2017. These funds will facilitate production and alpha testing of a DFM model and development of a smartphone and tablet app to control and download our systems remotely.Stretch Goal #2: $165,000 USD. Once we reach this funding goal, we will begin the production of injection molds and other tooling for mass manufacturing, purchase materials for this purpose, and begin the process of making these available to the public. Delivery is estimated at December 2016.Stretch Goal #3: $285,000 USD. At this funding goal we will be able to hire additional personnel to speed and expand product development. This will allow for several addition types of peripherals to be included in our first run production and bring the production to a more rapid realization, estimated as summer 2016.Stretch Goal #4: $450,000 USD. This would be a huge cry for accountability and an unprecedented mandate for our product to become a reality.  Reaching this goal will allow us to expand our efforts in the accountability movement to areas beyond just building an awesome product. At this level of support from you, the Guardian Family, we will open our planned non-profit wing with functions geared toward bringing about new accountability laws, helping our least advantaged clients receive devices at little to no cost, rights and accountability education programs and providing legal support for those facing accountability issues in the courts. We also want to hear from you what actions you would like to see taken in this arena, so email us, or hit us up of Facebook!    As you can see, the more money we can raise the faster that this becomes a reality. Help us to help you protect yourself and your loved ones faster! Perks for Now and Later: Our early perks will give you some very useful informational booklets, several unique shirts and other neat tangibles, but more importantly you get all the updates offering new perks and first dibs on upgrades and additional products to pre-order as we reach each goal in our funding! As we reach each goal, we will post many new and awesome perks, with a number of them being big discounts or pre-orders on additional peripherals and devices. For example, when we reach Stretch Goal #1, we will begin offering perks that give contributors the opportunity to order expanded systems at a discount of 10-15% first. Exact discount numbers will depend on final funding levels. More funding will allow for larger discounts. At Stretch Goal #3 we will post another perk giving contributors a wholesale package for extended systems to either use, or resale at any price they set. Known Risks and Possible Challenges:     While every endeavor has an element of risk, we are committed to minimizing the risks we ask contributors to bear. There are always possible delays in any manufacturing process, and some regulatory hurdles left to jump. We are using all off the shelf, known to function components and are really not inventing any new technology. It's all stuff that already works, we are just putting it together in a very new and different way than anything available today. This greatly reduces the risk factors because everything we are combining already works in other applications.     We have a very dedicated team of people with a wide range of skills to cover most possible contingencies. They have real world experience as well as the drive to recognize any challenge we may not have the skill set to overcome so we can find the right people to do just that. We have studied many other campaigns and manufacturing stories of technology products to see what challenges they faced and found ways to beat most of those before we will run into them. This being said we have built in extra delivery time to allow us to be on or ahead of schedule in a real world production environment.If We Don't Reach Our Goal: We feel sure we will reach our goal and well beyond with this campaign. However, we are not clairvoyant and anything is possible, so that may not happen. If we don't reach our initial goal, we will spend first on perk fulfillment, and all remaining funds will go toward the process of bringing our system to market. Our estimated time for perk fulfillment is Dec. 2017. Again, the more money we can raise, the faster this will happen.     We are dedicated to doing this. We believe in it. This is important to us all personally and we will get it done. Your help by funding us is just going to see that it happens a lot faster. We hope you will agree that this is an awesome idea who's time has come and help make this happen now.Other Ways You Can HelpSome people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:Get the word out and make some noise about this campaign to make a monumental shift in accountability today!

<p>We are two fun, music and technology-loving duo! We are open to everything and like everything! Both of us enjoy technology, and not just for the video games. But we realized one traumatizing thing: there are hardly any girls involved in tech, especially girls of color, which we want to change. Our goal is to help girls across the world achieve their dreams in tech.</p>
<p>To support our campaign, you may participate in following ways: </p>
<p>- become our backers and contribute to Indiegogo campaign (and win great perks including ""hard copy"" of our latest book ""Silicon Valley Butterflies"" <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N0F5BFN/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N0F5BFN/</a>)</p>
<p>- encourage your young girls to create educational videos/slides (on youtube.com and/or slideshare.net) and help them win amazing educational toys</p>
<p>- help us creating awareness of low percentage of girls in tech and how to change this by sharing our campaign on facebook, twitter and more.</p>
<p>Our first step towards our goal is to write the book ""<strong>SIlicon Valley Butterflies</strong>"".</p>
<h3>About The Book!</h3>
<p>Our book, Silicon Valley Butterflies, is about a girl from Afghanistan named Roya who moves to Silicon Valley Bay Area as a host student. She meets her host family there and discovers how technology is changing the world and how far her home country is keeping up. There, she learns about several technologies and how they work (including automated cars, amazon alexa, 3D printing and more). This, sparks her passion and excitement to create something new and creates a community of girls. Thirty four years in the future, Roya wins the Nobel Peace Award for helping girls in tech.</p>

<h3>Our Goal</h3>

</ul>
<p><b>Think about it... how often have you read an empowering story about an Asian, Middle Eastern, Black, or Latina girl succeeding in tech? </b>Probably not very often. We believe that by writing uplifting stories about girls of color, we can help other young girls envision themselves as leaders in the world of tech. </p>
<p>We Strongly believe,<b> Dreaming is the first step to achieving.</b></p>

The purpose of this walk was to challenge people to think again about the Gospel message. Before leaving home Clive’s family and friends said, “It was impossible”. As they arrived home four weeks later Clive passed under a large billboard carrying the advertising slogan “They said it was impossible.” Reminding Clive and Lathan that what is impossible with men is possible with God.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>What is impossible with men is possible with God </i></p><p style=""text-align: right;""><i>Luke 18:27          </i></p><p>Clive, who comes from a broken background, knows that it was God’s love that rescued him from a life of alcohol, drugs, crime, violence and prison. For many people this gruelling expedition was seen as lunacy. But for Clive it provided a unique opportunity to challenge people to think again about the Gospel message and encourage both Christians and non-believers.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463589252/indiegogo_glencoe_1_m4ipww.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p>Clive and Lathan have now walked over 5000 miles with the cross. Travelling throughout Wales, from Land’s End to John O’Groats and from Jerusalem to Rome (in the Footsteps of the Apostle Paul). They have run in the London and New York Marathons and climbed Ben Nevis, Britain’s highest mountain, during winter. (Details of these activities and future plans can be seen on their website <a href=""http://www.threesixteen.co.uk."" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.threesixteen.co.uk.</a>)</p><p>The sight of the cross has provoked a range of emotions and responses, including anger, ridicule and interest. Viewing the cross forces people to ask ""do I believe"" and many people have stopped Clive to ask why, what must they do to become a Christian and how do they find out more.</p><p> </p><p><b>The Project</b></p><p>Clive and Lathan would now like to produce a series of Bible studies inspired by events that occurred during these adventures. A short story will be told through film and pictures and relevant Bible verses and passages explored. The Bible studies will be designed for individual and group use and will also be employed as tools by Clive and Lathan during future activities. These exciting and uniquely presented Bible studies will be suitable for young and old alike.</p><p>The studies will be available as downloads to a computer, tablet or Smartphone and easily accessible from Threesixteen’s website and through online stores such as Amazon. Discussions have highlighted the accessibility provided by the development of a download or ""app"" and the provision of a short film, Bible passage, study questions and links to further resources in this easily accessible and popular format. The studies will also be provided on DVD. The Bible study download (""app"") and DVD will be readily available to interested churches, groups and individuals around the world.</p><p>The first series of four studies has been carefully considered and filming is now underway.</p><ol>
<li><span>Study 1 – They said it was impossible </span></li>
<li><span>Study 2 – What am I worth</span></li>
<li><span>Study 3 – Faith</span></li>
<li><span>Study 4 – God's Provision</span></li>
</ol><p>Draft studies shown to a church home group and in a prison Bible study have been well received. Positive feedback and encouraging suggestions are now being incorporated in to the individual studies.  </p><p>It is expected that each Bible study will take 2-3 weeks to complete. This unique and engaging series is been filmed and edited by photographer Lathan Ball and the stories told by Counties evangelist Clive Cornish. Development and production of the four Bible studies will be finished in May 2017.</p><p>To support the launch of the Bible studies and facilitate interaction with those who want to know more about Christianity and Threesixteen we would like to develop a responsive website. A responsive websites will adapt to the screen size of the viewing device providing optimum viewing on a laptop, tablet and Smartphone. A responsive website will not only give a positive viewing experience on a mobile device but support social media communication and interaction on the move and during events. Discussions with a web design company have been undertaken. The new website will be ready for launch in May/June 2017.</p><p>A small charge will be made for the Bible studies and the income will be employed in new projects helping Threesixteen to become a successful, self-supporting, on-going concern. Future walks and runs are planned for 2017 and 2018 and an art exhibition is under consideration.  Please support Threesixteen and help establish a new, exciting and viable ministry. </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463589589/Indiegogo_boy_1_i1qlwh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p><b>Financial Requirements, Stretched Goals and Rewards</b></p><p>Threesixteen is now raising £3000 to cover the immediate cost of Bible study production and developing a responsive website.  The costs include support for website development through a professional design agency and the production of artwork to support web and app development, packaging and presentation.The development of an app and responsive website will provide the viewer with  an easily accessible, enjoyable, modern and up to date viewing experience on a Smartphone, tablet or computer.</p><p>However, we hope to raise additional funds to support the filming, editing and production of a second series of Bible studies based upon the ascents of Snowdon, Cader Idris and Pen-y-Fan - the Welsh Three Peaks.  The climbs of these mountains with the cross are complete and we excitedly look forward to editing the footage and producing three more Bible studies.</p><p>The project costs are shown below:</p><ul>

<br/> </div></div>","THREESIXTEEN They said it was impossible  Introduction In 2003, evangelist Clive Cornish and photographer Lathan Ball set out from Cardiff to walk 450 miles around the perimeter of Wales carrying a large wooden cross. The purpose of this walk was to challenge people to think again about the Gospel message. Before leaving home Clive’s family and friends said, “It was impossible”. As they arrived home four weeks later Clive passed under a large billboard carrying the advertising slogan “They said it was impossible.” Reminding Clive and Lathan that what is impossible with men is possible with God.What is impossible with men is possible with God Luke 18:27          Clive, who comes from a broken background, knows that it was God’s love that rescued him from a life of alcohol, drugs, crime, violence and prison. For many people this gruelling expedition was seen as lunacy. But for Clive it provided a unique opportunity to challenge people to think again about the Gospel message and encourage both Christians and non-believers.  Clive and Lathan have now walked over 5000 miles with the cross. Travelling throughout Wales, from Land’s End to John O’Groats and from Jerusalem to Rome (in the Footsteps of the Apostle Paul). They have run in the London and New York Marathons and climbed Ben Nevis, Britain’s highest mountain, during winter. (Details of these activities and future plans can be seen on their website www.threesixteen.co.uk.)The sight of the cross has provoked a range of emotions and responses, including anger, ridicule and interest. Viewing the cross forces people to ask ""do I believe"" and many people have stopped Clive to ask why, what must they do to become a Christian and how do they find out more. The ProjectClive and Lathan would now like to produce a series of Bible studies inspired by events that occurred during these adventures. A short story will be told through film and pictures and relevant Bible verses and passages explored. The Bible studies will be designed for individual and group use and will also be employed as tools by Clive and Lathan during future activities. These exciting and uniquely presented Bible studies will be suitable for young and old alike.The studies will be available as downloads to a computer, tablet or Smartphone and easily accessible from Threesixteen’s website and through online stores such as Amazon. Discussions have highlighted the accessibility provided by the development of a download or ""app"" and the provision of a short film, Bible passage, study questions and links to further resources in this easily accessible and popular format. The studies will also be provided on DVD. The Bible study download (""app"") and DVD will be readily available to interested churches, groups and individuals around the world.The first series of four studies has been carefully considered and filming is now underway.
Study 1 – They said it was impossible 
Study 2 – What am I worth
Study 3 – Faith
Study 4 – God's Provision
Draft studies shown to a church home group and in a prison Bible study have been well received. Positive feedback and encouraging suggestions are now being incorporated in to the individual studies.  It is expected that each Bible study will take 2-3 weeks to complete. This unique and engaging series is been filmed and edited by photographer Lathan Ball and the stories told by Counties evangelist Clive Cornish. Development and production of the four Bible studies will be finished in May 2017.To support the launch of the Bible studies and facilitate interaction with those who want to know more about Christianity and Threesixteen we would like to develop a responsive website. A responsive websites will adapt to the screen size of the viewing device providing optimum viewing on a laptop, tablet and Smartphone. A responsive website will not only give a positive viewing experience on a mobile device but support social media communication and interaction on the move and during events. Discussions with a web design company have been undertaken. The new website will be ready for launch in May/June 2017.A small charge will be made for the Bible studies and the income will be employed in new projects helping Threesixteen to become a successful, self-supporting, on-going concern. Future walks and runs are planned for 2017 and 2018 and an art exhibition is under consideration.  Please support Threesixteen and help establish a new, exciting and viable ministry.   Financial Requirements, Stretched Goals and RewardsThreesixteen is now raising £3000 to cover the immediate cost of Bible study production and developing a responsive website.  The costs include support for website development through a professional design agency and the production of artwork to support web and app development, packaging and presentation.The development of an app and responsive website will provide the viewer with  an easily accessible, enjoyable, modern and up to date viewing experience on a Smartphone, tablet or computer.However, we hope to raise additional funds to support the filming, editing and production of a second series of Bible studies based upon the ascents of Snowdon, Cader Idris and Pen-y-Fan - the Welsh Three Peaks.  The climbs of these mountains with the cross are complete and we excitedly look forward to editing the footage and producing three more Bible studies.The project costs are shown below:

Web development & artwork                          £ 3000


Production of Bible study downloads          £ 3000       

                                                           Project Costs  £6000    Project promotion/commission costs        £750                                                                   Total Costs  £6750 Project and promotion costs include the commission payable to Indiegogo and processing fees. If you are interested in supporting but are unable to donate please help by praying for this project. You can also support us by sharing our work with your friends and social networks - as all exposure is extremely helpful. Thank you, we are extremely grateful for all the help and support you provide.  Long term aims and objectivesOver 5000 miles have now been walked, Britain’s highest mountains have been climbed and challenging marathons successfully run. During these unique events many photographs have been taken and film shot under exciting and challenging conditions. The walks, runs and climbs have engaged a large audience of all ages and from all walks of life. The images and the film have been well received at presentations and exhibitions demonstrating that the excitement, adventure and unpredictability of listening to God and following Jesus captured people’s imaginations and interest.  Under the name Threesixteen new creative projects are being planned and developed. It is hoped that these exciting projects will continue to interest, engage, challenge and inspire.To support these activities Threesixteen will develop original Bible studies, films and documentaries that bring the bible and its message to life. By supporting this project you will help prepare a unique series of Bible studies and encourage and support the development of a new venture to creatively communicate Christianity.    Threesixteen – Communicating Christianity CreativelyThreesixteen was formed to creatively communicate Christianity:
Threesixteen’s unique projects will challenge people to think again about the Gospel message - that Jesus loves them no matter who they are or what they have done.  
Threesixteen promotes the Christian message through photography, film and other forms of creative communication.  
Threesixteen are different because our work reflects the excitement, adventure and unpredictability of listening to God and following Jesus.
Threesixteen aim to produce engaging Bible based studies, films and documentaries for individual and small group use.
Threesixteen will support its activities through the production of fresh and original pictures, films, books, Bible studies and presentations. 
Threesixteen needs your prayers. Please pray for Threesixteen, its projects and the people who are touched by these activities

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am Catalin Rudolf, founder and head of the <b>International</b> <b>Festival of Visual Arts</b> <b>VSLO</b> (Vama Sub Lumini de Oscar). I have a 10-year long experience in film making and in photography having worked as a Cameraman. In 2010 I have started the VSLO festival which this year will be in its 7th edition.</p>
<p>This crowdfunding is dedicated to the project of my life which became important to many people in the domain of art.</p>
<p>The festival VSLO also known as ""The Woodstock of Photography"" does not compare to anything similar in the domain.</p>
<p>It unfolds during 10 days and the participants benefit from 14 different photography workshops, 5 film making workshops, daily classes of film and photography, painting, theater, daily concerts, photographic exhibitions, movies (short and long) screenings and much more. A cultural exchange is taking place among generations, professionals and amator, international and national actors.</p>
<p>VSLO means <i>freedom of expression</i>, <i>a cultural and social melting pot</i>. Participation is totally <b>free of charge</b>. All 400 photographers , film makers and passionate of visual arts (selected upon a portfolio) may take part to any activity at no cost. The build contacts, professional and social, forming a community and exchanging ideas and opinions.</p>
<p>There is a moment in life when each of us is thrilled to offer something that counts to the other people. It is the happiest moment.</p>
<p>Even if the financial part should not intervene in this context, it is essential for the implementation. </p>
<p>I persevere, against all odds and pressures, to keep it a free of charge event. Nevertheless, its success and its exponential growth (in terms of subjects presented, of hours of courses, of number of lecturers and of participants) have been accompanied by an exponential growth of the production costs.</p>
<p>You can contribute in the development and the continuation of this unique festival. You can support and sponsor talented artists to get a free specialized training which otherwise they wouldn't  be able to afford. You can help young talents to reach out with their art. You can make people extremely happy and be part of this special community</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The festival is unfolding over ten days and comprises several modules: <b>photography, film, theater, painting and concerts</b>.</p>
<p>Partnerships with various equipment manufacturers or other areas greatly help but the amounts are very far from the required value.</p>
<p><b>The Photo module</b> includes daily theoretical and practical courses. Every day two or more themes are treated. The module over 12 seminars are scheduled on various topics related to photography. In total 14 lecturers from 7 countries will be present (many of them major international prize winners) and 10 special guests. Young artists are encouraged to present their photography and therefore 14 exhibitions are held. They are all dedicated to young artists who have not had the opportunity or did not have financial means to do so.</p>
<p><b>The Film making module</b> includes theoretical and practical courses. The participants are encouraged to produce, during the 10 days of the festival, a short documentary or a story about the what is happening in the Vama Veche beach (and much is happening). Participants are passionate about this field but generally are people who can not afford expensive equipment or can not afford to attend classes delivered by world famous lecturers (a winner of an Emmy is among them) as these present at the VSLO. Every day there are projections in three different locations each one with its own specific: documentaries, short films and feature films. All these locations are chosen in open areas (beach) to be accessed by as many people as possible (the population in the Vama Veche sums up to many tens of thousands during August).</p>
<p><b>The Painting module</b> takes place during the whole festival and aims to discover new talents both from Romania and abroad. The two speakers are Romanians making their living form painting in Germany and Finland. They can best express how and what to do in order to pass from an amatorial to a professional status. This year we will introduce also <b>a new module: sculpture. </b></p>
<p><b>The Theater module</b> will be represented with 3 plays interpreted by young actors who are generally not accepted in big stages but they can express themselves freely in VSLO. Also module includes theoretical and practical courses about staging of a puppet show life size.</p>
<p><b>Outdoor concerts </b>will take place over a period of three days and will be attended by foreign and Romanian groups. Some of them are already famous but some others are new in the Romanian and international music scene.<br/>On music module we will have during of 4 days  drumming classes. The participants are encouraged to produce one show  which will be presented on the final day in front of all participants from all modules.</p>
<p>Funds will be needed to cover all the expenses for the lecturers (flights, general transport, accommodation, food etc). It will also finance the insurance for both the equipment put at the participants' disposal (professional cameras rental, lighting, computers for editing etc.) and the equipment necessary for the implementation of the event (screens, projectors, stage, lighting, etc.)</p>
<p>If this campaign will not raise the necessary funds, I will have to restrict some activities, to remove some modules and/or seek new partners.</p>
<p>Up to now it never happened and I have always collected the necessary financing. Someone up there is watching over me!</p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Have you a talent that no one knows? Have you heard that a photograph of yours is not good? Have you ever wanted to have your own exhibition of paintings? Do you sing in a band but you have not been on a stage as everyone says ""you're unknown""?</p>
<p><b>All these are possible at Vama Sub Lumini de Oscar!</b></p>
<p>One of the international languages, if not the most important, is<b> art</b>. Without art and culture, the world would be much poorer. Ideas, freedom of expression, talent are characteristics of individuals who can move freely around the world and for which there are no borders. It's incredible how this festival brings together people of art, young talents, open minded people who learn to express themselves. To free their imagination and to unveil what society and everyday life repress! The love for the beauty. The festival is already on the verge of its 6th edition. Over time the number of direct participants increased from a few dozen to a few hundred totaling many thousands. <i>Thousands of friends in dozens of countries. Thousands of people who connected across borders through art.</i></p>
<p>All this happens in Vama Veche in Romania. Where, regardless where you come, you feel free, you feel important, you feel ... at home.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p><b>The project started 7 years ago</b>, at a time when nobody thought it would be possible to implement. A festival in which people interact 24/24 for 10 days it was hard to imagine. From this point of view, funding was a difficult obstacle. However there were few people who liked with the idea and helped me. I am talking about large companies that have sponsored or supported us through various forms (equipment, products ...). Nevertheless, the most important help came from the lecturers (photographers, film makers or visual art artists) who were invited to be part of this event. The were invited to hold a course of one day but in all cases they were present throughout the festival, answering questions, helping with various projects and being active in the community. This happens because they fall in love with the atmosphere of the festival, with Vama Veche, because they share the values of this event and ... of myself. Of my work, my dedication, my passion. I could say that I belong to the group of participants who are free to express their ideas, their wishes, their passion and which can come true. My passion is Vama Sub Lumini de Oscar.</p>
<p>Certainly the most difficult obstacle in achieving this dream is the lack of money. But I'm lucky to be surrounded by great people who helped me overcome the difficulties and helped me to make true this dream of mine and of hundreds other people!</p>

</div></div>","You can buy Speakify licenses
for refugees in Sweden in this crowd founding. This way you help refugees to
learn Swedish and start their life in a new society faster and you´ll provide
Speakify with more resources so we can develop our method further.  
Why Speakify?
I came to Sweden
to study my master in industrial engineering. Naturally I wanted to learn the language
to understand the people around me and get to know them. 
It should not take
you more than a few weeks before you really start to understand people! 
I did a little bit of academic research, talked to people that could speak a
few languages, referred to my own experiences of learning English and Swedish and
from that I made a new method. My dream is to improve the way people learn a
language throughout the world by Speakify´s method™. 

Help us to help
refugees!Help refugees and immigrants build a new life, by integration and reduction of exclusion, thru acceptance by Speakify´s language platform, since the key to integration is the language. Today refugees and immigrants are coming to Europe. In Sweden 60% of the daily conversation is made by only 500 words. Speakify is focusing on those particular and most common words, to get the user integrated in the society as quickly as possible.Refugees and immigrants are faced with exclusion and isolation while most of them just have the wish to blend in and start building their new life.With Speakify they can become a part of society, through understanding language and culture. It is vitally important to know how people in the society think and act for a better communication.""Nobody can do everything but everyone can do something""We can join together, contribute and help refugees and immigrants to a better life and hope for a brighter future. We can all do something to help and support each other.Refugees and immigrants come here with almost nothing in their pockets and your donations will make it possible for them to get licenses to use Speakify´s methods and learn the Swedish language.Your donations will make it possible for us to keep developing our method, grow and be seen by even more people that need our help.Learning the language is a way to get into the new country's society, with a different culture and different values.With its methods, Speakify contributes to help refugees and immigrants to a quicker way of getting integrated into the society. What is
Speakify?Speakify is a low cost private, mobile, reliable and time flexible language mentor, which teaches people a second language.  It is a learning language platform with a high quality standard on graphics, adjusted exercises that are user-friendly based on the user’s native language.  Speakify reduces the language learning time not by focusing on the grammatical aspects of a language, but on the most important words.

<p>Plants &amp; Electronics are two very important fields of human life yet most of us know so little about them. I believe to truly solve this problem, we need a game like environment where the end user learns as they complete it.

DIY electronics kits have created a brand new industry and a giant ""arduino making"" market. Yet to this day there is still no kit that focuses primarly on plants &amp; electronics. We have changed that two years ago. Our vision has gained attention over the last year resulting in many conversations around the globe across DIY greenhouse farmers and total beginners both in plants &amp; electronics including programming.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Who I am</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Before telling you who I am, I would like to tell you a story.</p>
<p>One day, I was on a train to work, and there was an old Chinese lady sitting next to me. She saw me reading a Chinese book then started a conversation with me. (The conversation was in Chinese.)</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">""You're learning Chinese?"", asked the lady.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">""No, I'm teaching Chinese,"" said me.  </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">""Oh...that's not good. Teachers don't make money."" She was so serious that I didn't know what to answer, so I just smiled. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">""You should be a lawyer or a doctor. They make a lot of money. You're young. Don't waste time on teaching."" The lady continued. </p>
<p>After our short conversation, the lady left the train and her kind career proposals to me. I could tell she was deeply concerned about my future and I really appreciated that. She wasn't the first person trying to talk me out of the education field. Because of their words, I hesitated and staggered. However, my hesitation didn't stop me from marching forward to what I love to do: teaching. Last winter, I started this language school on my own.</p>
<p><strong style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Why the Campaign Is Important to Me</strong></p>
<p>The campaign is important not only because it's for me but it will benefit other people. Students need better classes. Teachers need better benefits. Other institutions need to see there are people who really care about their students. The society needs to see how important education is. <strong>Everyone is talking how important education is, but no one tells their children to be a teacher. </strong> And that's why I'm here, and that's why this campaign is important.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484756570/fxokxlh8hagqxqsyusor.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>The Magnitude You Can Help Me Achieve</strong></p>
<p>Two scenarios. If the campaign is fully funded, we will be very likely to have further investments, which may give the business a very prosperous future. If the campaign is underfunded, we might encounter greater challenges in dealing with financial situations. However, we will not easily give up and will try our best to continue chasing our dreams.</p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What We Need</h3>
<p>To get the business on the ground, we need an initial funding to start out. Some of the major expenses include but not limited to, rent, teachers' salary, legal and accounting services, insurance, company registration fees, business line, textbooks, website and domain, business software, office supplies and advertisements. </p>
<p>We're asking for a little bit over $7,000 for starting out the business. It's a rather small number compared to many other projects on Indiegogo. With your help, we hope this little amount of money will keep our dreams alive in 2017. </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">How You Can Help</h3>
<p>It's actually quite simple to help. You just need to choose one of the perks from the right side; then you're contributing. By selecting a perk, you will also receive our different types of services (<u>Everything About China</u> and <u>Self-learning Start Kit</u> will be delivered to your email address) depending on the level of your contribution. </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>By backing us, you will get various perks. Depending on the level of your contribution, you will gain access and insight into Chinese food, culture, and other fun stuff at only $6; immediate access to learning Chinese by utilizing our self-starter kit at merely $29; and Chinese classes for all level of students at different prices. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484756050/vec14tr1syhacny6irm6.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Why Are We So Different</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Accessible Location </strong></p>
<p>Indacube is conveniently located and easily accessible in the heart of the Financial District, New York. We're based in a WeWork location (85 Broad Street, 16th Floor, New York, NY 10004).</p>
<p><strong>Flexible Schedule </strong></p>
<p>Indacube is not only opening early in the morning but also late at night. The office is running from 10 am to 10 pm every day. Same hours for weekends. Once you select a perk containing instructional classes, we will contact you within 24 hours to learn the best times for you. Time is all you got now.</p>
<p><strong>Unique Learning Experience</strong></p>
<p>Learning in the CUBE has never been like learning in other places. We're trying to build the most student-friendly and individualized learning environment by adapting our curriculum to students, constantly receiving students' feedback, minimizing students' pressure and periodically evaluating teachers' performance. </p>
<p><strong>Experiential Learning Events</strong></p>
<p>We call it ""experiential"" because students' future experience in learning Chinese should be based on their interests and feedbacks. We have been trying to make our classes more culturally meaningful, physically interactive, verbally communicative, and adaptively responsive to the current world. For instance, students may have their class in Museum of Chinese Americans to get a glimpse of Chinese history and culture. Students may go to a restaurant to practice conversations for ordering foods. Other events will be arranged according to students' needs. </p>
<p><strong>Our Teachers Care</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we care. That's the reason why we chose to be teachers. We believe teachers are the most important resource that we have so that we put tremendous attention on teachers through our consistent support. The CUBE cares for its teachers and the teachers care for their students in return.</p>
<p><strong>Complimentary Beverages</strong></p>
<p>There's nothing much to say. This is IMPORTANT.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">How We Impact</h3>
<p>Learning should just happen. Yet, there're so many unsatisfying factors that potentially hinder people's learning. We're here to change that. </p>
<ul>
<li>Once again, we care, even though we know it's cliche to say. We truly care about our students' progress and teachers' benefits. It's not only a business for us but also it's a school for people. </li>
<li>We believe money should never be an issue for people who wants to learn. To make learning more affordable, we're offering different discounts for educators, college students, and people who come in our less busy hours.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Although Indacube is well-prepared and strongly competitive in its industry, it's hard to avoid risks and challenges as a new business. Two major conceivable challenges could be the lack of clients and financial pressure. Thanks to crowdfunding, with your help, we can overcome these challenges at the same time. The mechanism is quite simple: once you have invested in us, you're not only a benefactor but also a client. </p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>You can always share this campaign with your friends and family.Next time you see them, they’ll be greeting you with Nihao (hello) and ordering Chinese takeout in Chinese!</p>

If the campaign is underfunded, we might encounter greater challenges in dealing with financial situations. However, we will not easily give up and will try our best to continue chasing our dreams.

What We Need
To get the business on the ground, we need an initial funding to start out. Some of the major expenses include but not limited to, rent, teachers' salary, legal and accounting services, insurance, company registration fees, business line, textbooks, website and domain, business software, office supplies and advertisements. 
We're asking for a little bit over $7,000 for starting out the business. It's a rather small number compared to many other projects on Indiegogo. With your help, we hope this little amount of money will keep our dreams alive in 2017. 
How You Can Help
It's actually quite simple to help. You just need to choose one of the perks from the right side; then you're contributing. By selecting a perk, you will also receive our different types of services (Everything About China and Self-learning Start Kit will be delivered to your email address) depending on the level of your contribution. 
What You Get
By backing us, you will get various perks. Depending on the level of your contribution, you will gain access and insight into Chinese food, culture, and other fun stuff at only $6; immediate access to learning Chinese by utilizing our self-starter kit at merely $29; and Chinese classes for all level of students at different prices. 


Why Are We So Different
Accessible Location 
Indacube is conveniently located and easily accessible in the heart of the Financial District, New York. We're based in a WeWork location (85 Broad Street, 16th Floor, New York, NY 10004).
Flexible Schedule 
Indacube is not only opening early in the morning but also late at night. The office is running from 10 am to 10 pm every day. Same hours for weekends. Once you select a perk containing instructional classes, we will contact you within 24 hours to learn the best times for you. Time is all you got now.
Unique Learning Experience
Learning in the CUBE has never been like learning in other places. We're trying to build the most student-friendly and individualized learning environment by adapting our curriculum to students, constantly receiving students' feedback, minimizing students' pressure and periodically evaluating teachers' performance. 
Experiential Learning Events
We call it ""experiential"" because students' future experience in learning Chinese should be based on their interests and feedbacks. We have been trying to make our classes more culturally meaningful, physically interactive, verbally communicative, and adaptively responsive to the current world. For instance, students may have their class in Museum of Chinese Americans to get a glimpse of Chinese history and culture. Students may go to a restaurant to practice conversations for ordering foods. Other events will be arranged according to students' needs. 
Our Teachers Care
Yes, we care. That's the reason why we chose to be teachers. We believe teachers are the most important resource that we have so that we put tremendous attention on teachers through our consistent support. The CUBE cares for its teachers and the teachers care for their students in return.
Complimentary Beverages
There's nothing much to say. This is IMPORTANT.
How We Impact
Learning should just happen. Yet, there're so many unsatisfying factors that potentially hinder people's learning. We're here to change that. 

Once again, we care, even though we know it's cliche to say. We truly care about our students' progress and teachers' benefits. It's not only a business for us but also it's a school for people. 
We believe money should never be an issue for people who wants to learn. To make learning more affordable, we're offering different discounts for educators, college students, and people who come in our less busy hours.


Risks & Challenges
Although Indacube is well-prepared and strongly competitive in its industry, it's hard to avoid risks and challenges as a new business. Two major conceivable challenges could be the lack of clients and financial pressure. Thanks to crowdfunding, with your help, we can overcome these challenges at the same time. The mechanism is quite simple: once you have invested in us, you're not only a benefactor but also a client. 

Other Ways You Can Help
You can always share this campaign with your friends and family.Next time you see them, they’ll be greeting you with Nihao (hello) and ordering Chinese takeout in Chinese!

<p>        Hello. I’m Van Parkman, the editor-in-chief of this fledgling bi-monthly magazine. I am a Mississippian with a B.A. in History from William Carey University and an M.Phil. in Classics (specialising in Classical and Enlightenment philosophy and ancient Athenian politics) from Trinity College Dublin. The majority of our writers are Mississippians: we are teachers, professors, nurses, students, doctors, philosophers, and concerned citizens. We differ in political and cultural opinion, yet are unified in our solid and sober-minded presentation of news and cultural analysis. We also have a growing number contributors from other regions in the U.S., as well as Europe.</p>
<p>        One of our most distinguishing characteristics is the format of our magazine which actually gives readers a reason to pick up a physical copy or flip through our digital edition and read it from cover to cover. The internet era trend of reading articles divorced from their traditionally edited format within a magazine or newspaper is pragmatic and seemingly time efficient even if it reeks of radical individualism. The vision we have for our magazine is to give our readers a reason to read from cover to cover. What we offer is an experience…a journey that puts the past two months of world events in fresh perspective. To achieve this we offer more than traditional sections and columns. From the front cover through to the rolling of the credits we use a director’s vision to present our various magazine stages, filled with insight, irony, judgement, and joshing, to illuminate a defining and meaningful period of both your life and the world, the past two months. By the time you lay our magazine down we hope you are ready to walk away with a renewed zeal for a life of possibilities and a renewed sober, yet hopeful, conviction that our actions as humans matter.</p>
<p>        The idea for this magazine initially sprung from The Salisbury Review, a conservative British magazine founded during the Cold War. Its namesake, the 3rd Marquis of Salisbury, Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, served three terms as prime minister of the United Kingdom in the late 19th century and was renowned for his relaxed government. Likewise, The Coolidge Review is named after the most notable yet humble U.S. president of the 1920s, Calvin Coolidge. Under his gentle hand, America prospered greatly and grew in creativity, although not altogether without negative consequence. Much of our current cultural consciousness, lifestyle, technology, societal merits and faults, and even precursors to our modern American spirit are derived from 1920s era manifestations. Questions commonly thought but seldom asked concerning this era include, ""What did people have in the '20s that we don't today?"" ""What is the relationship of traditional elegance and high culture to all that is modern and risqué?"" ""How do we achieve a balance between tradition and that which is distinctly new or modern?"" These questions are to be explored and answered not through prescriptive abstract language crafted to ideologically enslave the most minds for the cheapest price, but through creative and stubborn practical application and argument. The best way out of any puzzle is usually the most creative; however, first one must recognise limitations and the tools at one's disposal. The approach of The Coolidge Review employs all these elements, especially the stubbornness.  </p>
<p>        The basic intent of this magazine is fundamentally twofold. First, the intent is to demonstrate the dependent and complementary status of all that is modern, classy, and genuinely progressive to traditional aesthetic styles, values, and moral and societal principles. Secondly, it is to expand the applicability of those traditional guidelines to as many areas as possible to demonstrate what true activism and creativity is capable of when judgement is allowed to guide the proverbial potter's hand. This way what is traditional will always be challenging and constructive rather than stale and irrelevant.<br/><br/>       Perhaps counterintuitively, studies show that creativity occurs most prominently and effectively under certain helpful restrictions and guidelines. Our writers believe this applies to politics and activism as well. Creativity should not be banned from the public square in favour of quick fixes or lazy thinking; likewise creativity, humour, and irony shouldn't be banned from cultural and political criticism. We hope to demonstrate what purpose-driven creativity looks like when applied to the biggest issues of our day – whether those issues have escaped unnoticed under sensationalist radars, or are well known and mainstream.<br/><br/>       This vision of a sober-minded yet intensely imaginative magazine will feature much more than mere analytical articles and cultural commentary. From start to finish, it will be a refreshing respite from the superficial and superfluous in the format, style, content, and presentation of more than 10 diverse and insightful sections. The layout of the magazine will cut through the fog of commercial distraction, and bestow a clarity on the world that can only be seen when you choose to keep cool with The Coolidge Review. Even the style of the magazine, which will be reminiscent of the Art Deco style of the '20s and '30s, fits into the magazine's philosophical consistency. Art Deco featured an undeniably modern, classy, and edgy style. Essentially, however, it was little more than a gloss-over, or an update and revival of, classical designs, styles, and architecture. Originally Art Deco was employed to help the modern man and woman, both in Europe and the United States, find a fresh identity and a way of psychological escape after the preternatural trauma of the Great War. Nonetheless, it was unmistakably dependent upon the timeless aesthetic and existential needs of human beings, and cleanly expressed these needs. This function parallels the literary and philosophical aims of the magazine nicely.<br/><br/>       Please help us achieve the vision of bringing this magazine to life and spreading our voices throughout the world. Planet Earth deserves to hear more than frantic white noise. This is therefore an environmental concern of the gravest magnitude.<br/><br/>       Most magazines fail before they even publish their second issue. Our writer base is derived of a community of visionary friends who will cling to a common conviction and vision. However, even with that advantage we have many practical concerns, and require initial monetary assistance.<br/><br/>       Our strategy is to begin primarily as a digital magazine, using a prolific online digital magazine distributer (which we have already chosen) to minimise initial fees. However, we can't be the cat's meow without physical copies, and we can't capture the hearts and minds of real people without the aesthetics and acoustics of paper. Therefore, we will initially print a small supply of bulk copies to be distributed by hand, on demand, and through subscription. However, low-end printing is not conducive to low subscription prices; nor is printing in general, without purchasing our own printing equipment. To be competitive we need equipment, and we currently have the physical space necessary to do our own printing. We also need initial funds to cover that crucial initial marketing period. Our graphic artists, designers, writers, and editors also would like to get paid, and to know that they are making a good investment of time and energy. We also need to see that others share our vision and are prepared to vicariously achieve that vision through us for what the citizens of Sandford in the cult movie Hot Fuzz would call, ""the greater good."" We are inspired by your enthusiasm. Even if we don't meet our financial goal, the magazine will continue as long as possible (probably forever) so any amount of funding will help.<br/><br/>       By contributing through the perk system you can subscribe early to our magazine. If you contribute ten dollars you will get a year’s digital subscription. Twenty dollars will purchase the digital subscription, plus the first print copy (expected mid-February 2017). With thirty dollars you can buy both subscriptions, print and digital, for a full year. In addition, all contributions will help us achieve more competitive pricing, as well as a higher-quality product aesthetically and substantively. Needless to say, you will also be helping to expose untold numbers of readers to a fresh and challenging way of thinking. Whether or not you contribute financially, please spread the word! Indiegogo makes it easy to share our story with their share tools. This magazine is going to be the bee's knees!<br/><br/>       Our writers are committed to this project. Your money will not be wasted; trust us to make your investment worthwhile. I for one have always wanted to be a writer. I have always been a writer; in fact it's the only thing that I can commit to doing full-heartedly. This is our passion.  <br/><br/>       We will employ judgement, humour, compassion, irony, classiness, and imagination to slash through hype, ideological distraction, and commercial trappings. With your help, we will vibrantly illustrate why the things that really matter do not always get the media or attention they deserve.</p> <p>Be cool. Read The Coolidge Review.<br/><br/>Thanks so much,<br/>Van and friends</p>

Join us at our Alternative Studies and Retreat Center! “The bright future of Mankind is determined when the Youth can stand on the shoulders of Giants to see the way clear.” ... Norman Brown The VisionI am so pleased to extend to you for your consideration an invitation to unite with Imagine Thailand Alternative Studies and Retreat Center.Imagine Thailand is the evolution of Monte Vista a beautiful retreat center that was located on Koh Phangan, Thailand. Monte Vista was a 12 year success proving my vision to serve humanity by helping over 6,000 people make positive life changes. I am now manifesting that vision with conviction of creating alternative studies and retreat centers worldwide to broaden the impact of love and healing. Imagine Thailand is the first of many to come on my journey to help heal the world.After Monte Vista I realized I could positively affect so many more by creating the Imagine Thailand Alternative Studies center where teachers of progressive disciplines from all over the world could come together and teach their much needed skills and healing knowledge. Their students would then go and teach and heal others thus creating a ripple effect of beautiful energy and creation that continues to grow and influence others the further it emanates from the source.  Be a part of something magical from the very beginning. ""One should see any opportunity to serve as a rare and precious gift...and never waste such an opportunity.” ... Amma Your contribution will help Imagine Thailand bring balance and peace to the world. My heartfelt intention is to begin breaking ground on the island of Koh Samui Thailand in January 2017. As a founding contributor you will bring Imagine Thailand and all the future Centers to become a reality.My fullest intention is to have founding contributors like you help us raise $250,000. The effect of positivity, healing and light Imagine Thailand will have on individuals, communities and the world is profound and intangible as the rippling swell of its effect flows throughout the world.The tangible benefits include the perks associated with the level of your contribution but more importantly the healing of many, the bringing of joy back into lives, and the remembering of our magic.  Feel the healing by reading just a few testimonials of those who have been on this path with me. “This is the beginning of my journey and I will be back soon to join it again. My eyes, heart and soul have been awakened and I finally feel that I am ready to find peace and happiness. Thank you Norman!”“Thank you all for your kindness and your guidance. I never expected to let go of so much in such a short time but I am leaving here inspired to continue my healing process. Namaste.”  “To all the angels at Monte Vista- Thank you for loving me and taking such good care of me and for always being there for me. You’ve helped me change my life! Wishing you all the love in the world!”“Thank you so much for creating such a perfect welcoming and healing place in such a beautiful location. The perfect inspiration for our entire trip! You’ve changed my life for the better and I will never forget the experience!”  ""Your work is to discover your world, and then with all your heart give yourself to it.""... Buddha ThailandA place of beauty and innocence. Not only a place that has a garden, but a place that IS a beautiful garden. Koh Samui is one of the three most popular beach destinations in Thailand and is an island in the Thai Peninsula that stretches from the west side of the Gulf from Thailand to Maylasia. The island is diverse, from the hustle and bustle of the white sandy beach at Chaweng to the laid back privacy of Lip Noi. With sandy beaches and rocky shorelines, Koh Samiu offers a lush tropical climate of an island in the Thai Peninsula. It is also part of the AngThong Marine Park known for some of the best diving in the world.  “I am not a teacher, but an awakener.”  ... Robert Frost​ Your Contributions The generous funds raised will be used to build the alternative studies and retreat center including classrooms, bungalows, common areas, treatment rooms, yoga deck, pool and kitchen. I will bring in practitioners, healers and teachers of all disciplines from all over the world to practice within these divine and serene spaces. The opportunity to share divine gifts with others is also, a gift.  ""Your work is to discover your world, and then with all your heart give yourself to it.""... Buddha In GratitudeI have had a vision of creating a momentous opportunity for anyone wanting to learn to help others which now presents itself.For years and from thousands of people just like you and me, I have been asked: How can I be of service to myself, others and the world?Imagine Thailand is the answer.Thank you for your contribution and helping change the world.  ""If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more, and become more, you are a leader.""  ... John Quincy AdamsI am Norman BrownI am an international speaker, spiritual teacher, business owner and life coach with decades of experience in coaching and guiding people through transformational phases in their lives.

Some days I’d watch over six kids under the age of 7 including my youngest daughter. I would stop by the fabric or hardware store on my way home from work to get supplies to build the prototype. I remember taking an ordinary household saw, using it to cut a metal dry erase board in half, and thinking how on earth am I going to do this? </span>

</div></div>","We need your help to produce a small run of voiceboxes for our educational pilot program addressing the needs of refugee pre-school children in Lebanon, Jordan and the Netherlands.

Your contribution will help us take these next critical steps:

Determine best production methods,
Source materials,
Produce, assemble and ship within six months the necessary voiceboxes to run our pilot program.
I began this project alone in 2012, when my horror and outrage at the devastation and chaos unfolding in Syria turned to determination to find some way to help kids who’d become refugees overnight. 
I spent the next 10 months creating a functional prototype of The Voicebox. 
I’m a single mother, and at the time, I was a nanny for a family with baby triplets and an older sister. Some days I’d watch over six kids under the age of 7 including my youngest daughter. I would stop by the fabric or hardware store on my way home from work to get supplies to build the prototype. I remember taking an ordinary household saw, using it to cut a metal dry erase board in half, and thinking how on earth am I going to do this? 
I didn’t have all the answers, but truthfully, no one ever does. I pushed all doubts aside and focused on each next step. 
I invented The Voicebox to deliver hope.

 

""I learned about The Voicebox when its use was demonstrated to me by Katrina van Pelt, when I visited her sometime ago. Immediately I was interested, because also in the Netherlands we have a large number of refugees and among them many children. The importance of The Voicebox is that it gives children the chance to mix fantasy and reality, offering them a chance to process the nightmares of war as they play and learn. Please support this campaign so we can bring The Voicebox to refugee children in the Netherlands.” Immy Nieboer, Public Health Consultant
Millions of refugee children around the world have been displaced and are in limbo as they wait. The internet is awash with this tragedy, unfolding in real-time.The images are heartbreaking, I know you’ve seen them too. Young children, bewildered, searching for context in the pebbles near the water jugs that are now the family’s new water source.  Some stay huddled close to a parent, perhaps wondering whether the camera they see is really some sort of weapon. Displacement itself is devastating, when it’s the result of violence that claims family members and possessions, we’re talking about trauma.
These children need to keep learning, they need help dealing with the effects of what they’ve witnessed.

 

“As CEO of Vision Hope International I have been working in the Middle East since 2002. Trauma therapy for children is much needed in the countries we work in: Yemen, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. I have seen children in our Trauma kindergartens in Jordan, using The Voicebox. We are grateful that The Voicebox will be available soon in our day to day, play-based therapy with 200 children. Your support is more than welcome.” Matthias Leibbrand, CEO Vision Hope International e.V.

 
  

The Voicebox equips preschoolers with materials and experiences that:

encourage collaborative play
challenge young minds to think creatively
present 3D and 2D ways to acquire language
engage fine motor skill development
foster spatial awareness
aid in developing agency and a sense of self

I firmly believe that we can make a difference.  If there is one thing that has stood out as astounding in this project, it is the overwhelming show of support from all those who have stepped forward to help. Friends and family, professors and teachers, mentors and strangers, all have proven that there is an immense undercurrent of compassion and love for humanity. We can forget this when we are watching the news of babies being washed up on shore, whole villages being blown up. But, there is incredible power in that undercurrent, and if we go with it, we are infinite in our capacity to help. 


We can deliver hope where it is needed most. 

 

“We would like to use The Voicebox at our schools as it is a great fun learning toy that will help us teach vocabulary to the students. When they are able to see and touch they will learn faster. In addition, we are trying to add more creativity in our program and The Voicebox will surely do that!.“ Suha Tutunji, Jusoor Program Director

 




I can not tell you how amazing it feels to be this close to The Voicebox being in the hands of the children it was designed to help.This project has been a way for me to channel my outrage and frustration into a positive solution. Please contribute in any way you can. It’s amazing what we can accomplish together. 


p.s. We are Patent-Pending and ready to go.....Let's do this!  



Meet Our Team 





Katrina van Pelt I have been an educator of preschool-aged children for over twenty years. Professionally I have been a teacher, licensed daycare provider and nanny, and on a more personal level, I'm a proud mother of three amazing kids. Most of my experience has been within a progressive ""free school"" teaching model and over the course of my career I have helped guide more than 100 children within a context of social learning. It is my belief that early childhood experiences help to set the foundations for the type of learner a student will become. I have always been interested in how and why we become driven to learn new skills and understand new ideas, so I find this work highly rewarding. 

  






Jose PerezAfter 10 years working with a great variety of industries as an industrial engineer consultant I shifted my focus toward the IT field. In 2000, I returned to college and earned a second degree, a Master's in Open Information Systems, then worked as a Project Manager in IT projects for seven years. In 2011, I established my own company developing custom database applications.
Recently, I moved with my family to Amherst, MA, where I met Katrina and became engaged in the design for manufacturing of her humanitarian project: The Voicebox.  An unexpected return to my original career and passion as an industrial engineer.

 


 





Amanda Judd
I’m a lifelong learner, artist and an educator. Willing to bushwhack, I created my own Digital Arts major as an undergrad because, believe it or not, there was no such thing at the University then. I went on to get my Master’s in Learning, Media and Technology, where I boldly ventured off into MBA-land to study because I was curious about marketing, social media and how to get real results. 
Since then I’ve consulted with small business owners about marketing, built some websites, and last year, co-wrote and published a book about collaboration and art making.

<p> One Planet International School in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia was started with only 15 kids as a social enterprise in 2006.  The idea was to build a school which would balance academic excellence with character education.   The mission of the school is “to unravel the unique potential hidden in every child and to foster in him/her a desire to serve humanity.”   The school also has a longer-term vision to impact the quality of education on a broader scale:  to provide a model of education for the country, to improve the quality of learning, and to ultimately raise a society dedicated to serving humanity.   </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p><strong>Over Ten Years of Experience and Social Impact</strong></p>
<p>The school has now been self-sustaining for more than 10 years with nearly 500 students from age 3 through high school.  After adding one grade per year, the school will celebrate its first graduating class in June 2018.   </p>
<p>The school has created a model to extend its quality education to children who could not otherwise afford it.  15 girls from an orphan / street children's program have been offered full scholarships.  In addition, full or partial scholarships are provided to many other children in need.    In total, One Planet currently provides $86,000 worth of scholarships per year to 55 students.   Twenty-nine students receive 100% scholarships.   Seventeen students receive 50% scholarships or more, and nine students receive scholarships ranging from 15 to 35%. Currently 40% of students receiving scholarships are girls, but we plan to increase the percentage to at least 65%.</p>

<p>In addition, the school is committed to building the capacity of local teachers through its teacher training program. Its curriculum and quality control unit helps to monitor quality teaching, while at the same time providing mentorship to develop the capacity of the teachers. Providing quality education in Addis Ababa helps the country to attract international organizations, foreign investors, and returning diaspora. At the same time, the school assists in meeting the demands of the growing middle class, and encourages Ethiopia’s most-educated to stay and help the country to grow.</p>
<p><strong>Building a Permanent Facility for One Planet</strong></p>
<p>Currently the school is on rented property and it is spending over $150,000 a year on rent.    The school is under constant threat of losing its lease as high rises are going up all over the city and on every side of the school.    In November 2017, the school lost half of its high school and middle school playground due to a road expansion in front of the school.</p>

<p>Over the past few years the school has been trying to find a way to build a permanent facility for One Planet.   Earlier this year, Zelalem and Gail sold nearly everything they own in order to buy land for the school.   The school now owns 2,500 square meters of land in the heart of the CMC Summit area of Addis Ababa, where most of One Planet’s students live.  </p>

<p><strong>The Campaign -- Many Ways to Help</strong></p>

If we exceed our Indiegogo goal, it will help us to get that much closer to our ultimate goal.     Yes, US$50,000 is just a drop in the bucket of what we ultimately need,   But we believe in the miracle of universal participation.  Every little bit will help whether it is $5 or $10,000 -- so please help us to spread the word. </p>
<p><strong>Help us Fund our Scholarship Program</strong></p>
<p>As previously mentioned, One Planet is providing $86,000 worth of scholarships per year to 55 students.  One way to help One Planet would be to help us to cover the cost of these existing scholarships.  This would allow One Planet to use more of its own funds to cover the cost of construction.    Tuition and material fees vary by grade level, but on average, the total cost of supporting one student with tuition, fees, uniform, school trips and counseling support is US$3,000 per year.    A single student can be with One Planet up to 15 years, but students join us at varying ages.   </p>
<p>If you would like to fund a scholarship, you can choose a 50% or 100% scholarship as a perk from the right column.   If you would like to pay for multiple years you can purchase more than one.</p>
<p><strong>Dedicate a Brick, a Reading Corner, Classroom, Garden, Laboratory or even a Library</strong></p>
<p>You may contribute any amount you wish, or you may decide to contribute towards one of the goals mentioned in the right column.    For example, you may wish to dedicate a classroom or library in honor of a loved one or in the name of your community.     You or the children in your community may enjoy submitting artwork which will be printed on a ceramic tile and permanently installed in the school.   </p>
<p>If you are interested in helping One Planet, you can contribute, host a fund raiser, and tell your friends and family about this campaign. You may enjoy working together with your local community, your book club, your extended family or co-workers to raise funds to build a classroom, science lab, library or other feature listed under the perks.      You may even wish to check if you employer has corporate responsibility funds to make available.  If you are interested in hosting a fund raiser, we can share ideas for your event. </p>

<p> </p>
</div></div>","One Planet International School in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia was started with only 15 kids as a social enterprise in 2006.  The idea was to build a school which would balance academic excellence with character education.   The mission of the school is “to unravel the unique potential hidden in every child and to foster in him/her a desire to serve humanity.”   The school also has a longer-term vision to impact the quality of education on a broader scale:  to provide a model of education for the country, to improve the quality of learning, and to ultimately raise a society dedicated to serving humanity.   

 
Over Ten Years of Experience and Social Impact
The school has now been self-sustaining for more than 10 years with nearly 500 students from age 3 through high school.  After adding one grade per year, the school will celebrate its first graduating class in June 2018.   
The school has created a model to extend its quality education to children who could not otherwise afford it.  15 girls from an orphan / street children's program have been offered full scholarships.  In addition, full or partial scholarships are provided to many other children in need.    In total, One Planet currently provides $86,000 worth of scholarships per year to 55 students.   Twenty-nine students receive 100% scholarships.   Seventeen students receive 50% scholarships or more, and nine students receive scholarships ranging from 15 to 35%. Currently 40% of students receiving scholarships are girls, but we plan to increase the percentage to at least 65%.

In addition, the school is committed to building the capacity of local teachers through its teacher training program. Its curriculum and quality control unit helps to monitor quality teaching, while at the same time providing mentorship to develop the capacity of the teachers. Providing quality education in Addis Ababa helps the country to attract international organizations, foreign investors, and returning diaspora. At the same time, the school assists in meeting the demands of the growing middle class, and encourages Ethiopia’s most-educated to stay and help the country to grow.
Building a Permanent Facility for One Planet
Currently the school is on rented property and it is spending over $150,000 a year on rent.    The school is under constant threat of losing its lease as high rises are going up all over the city and on every side of the school.    In November 2017, the school lost half of its high school and middle school playground due to a road expansion in front of the school.

Over the past few years the school has been trying to find a way to build a permanent facility for One Planet.   Earlier this year, Zelalem and Gail sold nearly everything they own in order to buy land for the school.   The school now owns 2,500 square meters of land in the heart of the CMC Summit area of Addis Ababa, where most of One Planet’s students live.  

The Design
One of the parents of the school and renowned architect, worked with the students, parents, teachers and staff of One Planet through a participatory process to design the school. 

The architect has prepared two designs.  The first design, estimated to cost 3,8 million US dollars translates the vision of One Planet and the input from students, parents, teachers and staff into an ideal purpose-built facility.  The second design, estimated to cost 1.8 million US dollars, is a scaled down version of the first design.    The design we implement will depend on the amount we are able to raise to build the foundation.

As an internationally renowned health expert and nutritionist, one thing became painfully clear: Our children have little chance of growing into healthy, caring and happy adults, unless someone stepped up and offered a solution.I was committed to creating a global company and fan base to provide healthy, educational and inspirational alternatives, instead of just the traditional health information and fantasy role models available to kids and parents today.  The next step became clear overnight. It was time to dedicate 100% of my time to develop my vision. Pauli Broccoli & Friends were on the way to become global health heroes and educators! It was time to make Green The New Cool!After my first book ""The Adventures of Pauli Broccoli” became an absolute hit, I knew  what I had to do next. I had to pursue exactly what the world is in dire need of; empowering children and families through healthy, fun, positive education and entertainment.All that’s needed is your generous support to bring this book to life through animation, apps, games, and other educational products, which, as you can imagine, is a very resource-demanding process.But most of all, I need your support to make my vision a reality; to spread this message around the world. But before you decide whether or not to support my dream, consider this: What is more important than protecting our most valuable resource; our children? Book Testimonials""Brilliant! Mealtime has always been a chore with my 3 kids, as they refused to eat anything healthy / green. I bought the book after reading the positive reviews and WOW! Someone has finally figured out how to get my kids to eat their greens and LOVE them! Thank YOU for making our dinners fun again!"" Jannine M.""Pauli is a delightful story that takes your child on a wonderful journey. Not only are they learning about where healthy food comes from, but they are transported to different countries around the world. The fun and light-hearted dialogue is teaching our children how to eat properly and with recipes!. This is a wonderful read for children and their families! My grand-daughter (6 years old) was excited and engaged while we read of Pauli's adventures. We purchased a copy for her younger cousin as well. This is a fun way to share why eating healthy is so important.""  E. Moore, Seattle""This a great read! The storyline and vibrant illustrations do a beautiful job at keeping kids engaged! Characters are really personable and ""cool"". It is also a fun entertaining book to read to children from an adult perspective. Definitely worth it!"" Amazon Customer""This is a wonderful story!

Our mission to help raise more ecologically conscious and compassionate children who will become guardians of our planet AND OUR PEOPLE.Our mission is to inspire and empower families to make simple, sustainable changes starting at home. How do we do this? By teaching the following
how to create new patterns of behavior and thinking in order to make positive changes for the health of the world.
how to be ecologically conscious so that living sustainably will be second nature to them.
to understand how their immediate actions are connected to overall environmental health.
What’s inside our digital magazines? Each interactive issue will focus on a different area of the world, and will be chock full of  geographical projects, stories, DIY projects, a book club, inspiring videos and podcasts for you and your little global guardian.  By design, each magazine will have ongoing, interactive projects and challenges for you and your family to help take steps to become  global changemakers. There are two ways you can purchase our digital magazines.  Either through our a la carte option, where you can choose the magazines you’d like to receive immediately.The second option is to become a member by subscribing to our monthly program. As a subscriber, you’ll receive our digital magazine at a discounted rate in your inbox each month. We’ve spent the past year in beta mode, testing and tweaking our content.  We’ve had a core group of subscribers who have given us consistent feedback on what they like, what should change and how we can do better.  Now we’re ready to scale our project. We’re ready to start creating a serious impact on the world. Through your contribution, the Global Guardian Project will be able to inspire, educate and unite children across the planet.Global Guardian Project's stakeholders literally encompass the entire world.  It starts with you and me, flows to our children, schools, our community, natural environment, all living beings, and finally the Earth itself. There is no being or living thing that couldn't be positively affected by Global Guardian Project's work. Raising our kids to care deeply and passionately about the health of our planet should be one of our top priorities as parents. But sometimes the amount of issues seem so huge that it’s hard to know where to begin.That’s where we come in.Our project helps families change their actions in everyday life. These are actions aid in the overall health of the world.  And we’re targeting the entire family, so those new behaviors will create a generational shift, meaning that what we teach a 5 year old will stick with him or her through adulthood.  That child will have new opportunities to learn, and then in return, teach these new behaviors to those around him or her. This causes a ripple effect of change.Investing in our family’s future by educating and inspiring our children is the foundation to homeschooling. Our curriculum teaches children to care for our environment, and in turn, becoming future global contributors. Global Guardian Project gives you the tools to get you started and makes it easy to learn at your own pace. Each month we build on what you learn, helping you to make permanent, sustainable positive changes in the home.  Global Guardian Project focuses on providing global education, inspiring everyday activism, and bringing these together through monthly STEAM based (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, Math) lessons and learning activities. We believe this is a robust approach to educating the 21st century child. For example, we help children see how they can pair ideas with technology skills so they can actualize solutions. Our goal is to inspire change and give young global guardians tools to make it happen.We are creating a space, both online and off, called the Young Changemaker Community,  where children will be empowered to take what they've learned and pitch ideas on projects, actions or inventions that would make a positive shift toward sustainability and ecosystem health. There they can connect with each other to coordinate their own Global Guardian offline events and meet-ups. We’d be creating a space for kids to connect and develop their own ideas on how to change the world.GGP helps to prevent extinction on this planet by teaching how we are all interconnected and interdependent; which is what makes our approach unique.In each digital issue we teach about intrinsic value, which means that something or someone has inherent worth, and that their value does not only come from how useful they are to humans. It is more important than ever to protect each creature and its unique role on the planet. We believe that if we want to heal humanity, it is just as important that we need to heal our relationships with animals.It is imperative that we protect our Earth's ecosystems. To do that, we must educate our children on how nature works, how everything is interconnected and interdependent.  This will teach us that we are a small part of a whole, not separate, but inclusive of a much bigger picture.  That we depend on each other and the Earth, and the health of the Earth ultimately depends on us.Our home.  We only have one.  And we're facing huge challenges that we'll eventually have to hand off to our children and our grandchildren.  Unless, we can teach children NOW how to be global stewards, so that in the future caring for the Earth and it's inhabitants becomes second nature. Not an overwhelming issue as we treat it today, but a right and responsibility that's born at the core and ingrained in the soul.  We chose our goal of $15,000 to expand our efforts to produce more content, begin translating into other languages and further sustain our work. For the past year we have been building this initiative all pro bono, now we want to expand operations and we need this 15k to grow our content writing and marketing efforts.  “As an artist and social entrepreneur, global education and environmental awareness has always been the subject of my work.  I used art to tell stories of global struggles and the power of educating children for social change.As my own children grew, I started to see that there was a huge disconnect when it came to educating children on how to care for the Earth.  There was no place for me to turn to that teaches my children how the world is interconnected. How we all depend on each other.Through my art and global travels, somewhere along the line a seed was planted.  It grew deep inside me.  I knew I had to create a way to take my pairing of art and global education to create an interactive learning tool.  That seed sprouted into the Global Guardian Project.It was then that I really realized my calling in life is to create ideas, opportunities and solutions for global minded parents so they can teach their own children how to care for the Earth. This is how I contribute to the world- by using my art + passion for global awareness to create a ripple effect for global good."" -Rebecca Lane, FounderDanielle Chassin Known as Hippie in Disguise to the many who follow her blog and Instagram account, Danielle is a policy strategist for the Canadian government by day, urban adventurer and simplicity seeker by night.

Det vil bla. være ved brug af værktøjer fra fx HeartMath, Way of Council, Yoga, Entrepreneurship, innovative undervisningsmetoder og “best practice” fra både uddannelsessystemet og erhvervslivet. Skolen bliver selvfølgelig også holistisk dvs. at børnene hver dag skal næres både, fysisk, mentalt, følelsesmæssigt og åndeligt.</p><p>Skolens bygninger og beliggenhed vil afspejle skolens værdier med fokus på natur, ved at have fri adgang til masser af natur, drivhus og permakulturel dyrkning af både frugt og grøntsager.

Det vil bla. være ved brug af værktøjer fra fx HeartMath, Way of Council, Yoga, Entrepreneurship, innovative undervisningsmetoder og “best practice” fra både uddannelsessystemet og erhvervslivet. Skolen bliver selvfølgelig også holistisk dvs. at børnene hver dag skal næres både, fysisk, mentalt, følelsesmæssigt og åndeligt.Skolens bygninger og beliggenhed vil afspejle skolens værdier med fokus på natur, ved at have fri adgang til masser af natur, drivhus og permakulturel dyrkning af både frugt og grøntsager. Lokalerne skal støtte op om vores indsats om at imødekomme børns unikke behov og forskellige læringstyper.Bygninger, materiale, kost mv vil alt sammen blive så bæredygtigt som muligt og vi vil arbejde på at optimere dette år for år.Alt sammen det der skal til for at vores børn trives, udlever hver deres unikke potentiale og får en skolegang der både beriger deres barndom og skaber et stærkt fundament for resten af livet.

</p><p>In 2014 Daphne and I serendipitously
sat next to each other on an airplane. I found myself telling her of my
fantastic experience at Mpopongi Primary School in Kenya. While I listened to
her experience of exploring Kenya as a 12 year old, I explained how I wanted to
help the children at Mpopongi School. From this one amazing conversation
a friendship and this website was created! Together we can make a difference, we can improve the quality of these Maasai students lives.</p>

<p>The
problem begins with a lack of funding for education. Almost every day, these
Maasai children have to deal with overcrowded classrooms, unsanitary kitchens, extremely
poor bathroom conditions, and a lack of clean, filtered water. All classes need; <b>New floors, paint and windows. </b>The toilets are unusable and must be replaced. There are over 550 students in the school and as many as six share one desk, therefore new desks are essential.</p>

<p>Recently,
an earthquake of 7.9 magnitude had shattered entire Nepal. Leaving thousands of
people homeless, with no food to eat and water to drink. It is a saddening fact
that one might have worked entire life for building a house and live with their
loved ones. No one can compensate the loss they have suffered. Children have
lost their parents in the debris , mothers are left helpless, children are
shattered by their parents loss, adventurers show no sign of return.</p>
<p>In
this event of crisis, we pray for the well-being of the survivor victims of the
earthquake. What has happened wasn’t really in our hands, as no one can compete
with nature’s destiny. But, what is in our hands NOW at this moment is more
important.</p>
<p>Helping
someone wouldn’t decrease your wealth, instead will add thousands of well-wishes
from the beneficiaries. An amount doesn’t matter; it can be even a single
penny, as it can buy a piece of bread.</p>
<p>Need
of the hour is that we do as much as relief programs as possible. Or else, even
survival for the survivor victims would be impossible.</p>
<p>We
would request you to please contribute as much as you can, and don’t judge it
as a meager amount, as even a single penny from large sources could bring an
ocean of funds.</p>
<p>This
funding is going to be used entirely for the welfare of the survivor victims in
the villages in the rural areas of Nepal. The more funds, the more we can help.</p><p>We would be going to the rural parts of Nepal, helping &amp; providing Relief Packages Directly to them which would consist of all the necessary items like Food, Blankets &amp; so on.</p>

your valuable response.</p>

Nepal! </p><p></p><p>__</p>

They are helping us locally to reach & help the victims. All the funds contributed from you will be transferred to Yaman's Father, Navin Agarwal's bank a/c.As of 12th May, taking note of the collected funds we have ordered 300 Double Blankets. We will increase the number of blankets as the funds goes up. We are currently travelling to Mukwanpur, Nepal via road to donate the needy. We were informed by Bhuwan ji(President, Hetauda COC) that more than food, there is a necessity of blankets. As food is being contributed from round the globe. As the affected area gets extremely cold in the nights. With that, I hope there is transparency in the campaign about how the funds are going in.Quakes measured at 7.9 ritcher scale shook Nepal shattering people's lives & home need your help now.We're working with Jhapa Chamber of Commerce & Industry to help the survivor victims of the natural calamity in the villages of Nepal.We shall be releasing a video, of the relief program by the end of this month..We
are here from  CookingShooking, a cooking
channel on Youtube.
Recently,
an earthquake of 7.9 magnitude had shattered entire Nepal. Leaving thousands of
people homeless, with no food to eat and water to drink. It is a saddening fact
that one might have worked entire life for building a house and live with their
loved ones. No one can compensate the loss they have suffered. Children have
lost their parents in the debris , mothers are left helpless, children are
shattered by their parents loss, adventurers show no sign of return.
In
this event of crisis, we pray for the well-being of the survivor victims of the
earthquake. What has happened wasn’t really in our hands, as no one can compete
with nature’s destiny. But, what is in our hands NOW at this moment is more
important.
Helping
someone wouldn’t decrease your wealth, instead will add thousands of well-wishes
from the beneficiaries. An amount doesn’t matter; it can be even a single
penny, as it can buy a piece of bread.
Need
of the hour is that we do as much as relief programs as possible. Or else, even
survival for the survivor victims would be impossible.
We
would request you to please contribute as much as you can, and don’t judge it
as a meager amount, as even a single penny from large sources could bring an
ocean of funds.
This
funding is going to be used entirely for the welfare of the survivor victims in
the villages in the rural areas of Nepal. The more funds, the more we can help.We would be going to the rural parts of Nepal, helping & providing Relief Packages Directly to them which would consist of all the necessary items like Food, Blankets & so on.
Seeking
your valuable response.
Jai
Nepal! __

<p>The American Archive of Public Broadcasting (AAPB) has embarked on a project to preserve for posterity significant public television and radio programs of the past 60 years. A collaboration between WGBH Educational Foundation and the Library of Congress, the AAPB has digitized 40,000 hours of material from more than 100 public media organizations across the country. These materials are preserved at the Library of Congress and made available to researchers online at americanarchive.org. <br/></p>
<p>But the 40,000 hours is only a drop in the bucket.<br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Right
now, analog video and audio content is deteriorating before our eyes. Stored on
obsolete magnetic media formats such as 2"" and 1"" videotape, this
audiovisual documentation of our 20th century is at risk of being lost forever.
Experts in the field of moving image and sound preservation are in consensus
that<b> we have no more than 12 years, and likely less, to digitally
preserve analog recordings before they are lost forever</b>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Just as vulnerable as analog media are new productions that are created digitally. Managing content that is ""born digital"" is expensive and requires specific training in digital preservation.

<h3>The Perks of Funding the Scholarship<br/>
</h3>
Of course, the biggest perk of helping us educate public media professionals in the best practices of digital preservation is knowing that the knowledge gained through the project will contribute to the assurance that local history is preserved and made available for generations to come. But we'd like to give you more than that.<br/><br/>In exchange for your support, we want to give you an opportunity to become personally involved in the project and benefit from the educational opportunities. Needless to say, everyone needs to be able to personally manage and preserve their own archival materials -- from home movies to digital photographs and personal records. Check out the perks to see how you might gain skills in personal digital archiving. You could also get a personal archiving consultation with a professional moving image archivist on staff at WGBH or have your home movies digitized by WGBH. There are other cool perks, too.

The Impact San Francisco is one of the most historic American cities for the Korean Community, as the first Korean-American diplomatic project, first Korean-American newsletter, and first Korean-American monument were all established in SF. Now that many other American cities have KFest events, we feel that KFest San Francisco will bring the journey full circle. 
As Korea increasingly permeates popular TV/film, music, technology, and food, we can ride this ""Hallyu: Korean Wave"" toward learning more about this ancient yet leading edge country. It is important for us to get familiar with Korean culture, its artists, thinkers and people not only because Korea has opened itself to the world more recently than other Asian countries, but also because Korean society, policy & economics are increasingly influential, affecting us here in America. We'd like to shine a light on the mystery that surrounds Korea, in a celebratory and interactive way. So on July 11th, come KFest with us!

<a href=""http://oerhs.org/oerm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Oregon Electric Railway Museum </a>, the largest Trolley Museum in the Pacific Northwest, has received a collection of nine Brussels Trams (#BelgiumTrams). These cars need temporary protection from the elements until a new Carbarn can be built to permanently house this impressive collection. The Tram cars range in age from 63-80+ years old. They include passenger trams as well trams used to maintain the system.

<p>As you may know, Oregon is noted for rain for most of the year. Anything left outside needs to be covered to protect it. Tarps, however, can cause more damage long term keeping moisture in. The solution is what we call a Trolley Koozie. Basically it is all-weather protection that will drape around the car to protect them form the rain, and allow them to""breathe"". The trucking industry calls them ""Toaster Covers"". This will prevent further deterioration until a suitable building is built within the next 5 years. Here is an example of what it looks like:</p>

<h3></h3>
<p>The material we are considering is made of Armorlon. It is a lower cost alternative that will help protect the cars long enough for us to build the new carbarn. We will build a structure around the car and place the Armorlon over the structure. This will allow the car to breath and keep moisture from accumulating under the tarp.</p>

<h3>OERHS History with Major Projects</h3>
<p>The <a href=""http://oerhs.org/oerhs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">OERHS</a> does have a track record of taking on major projects. The group was founded in 1957, We built a museum in Glenwood, Oregon in the Coast Range mountains outside of Portland. In 1995 the museum needed to move due to a land sale. The entire trolley collection was moved to <a href=""http://antiquepowerland.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Antique Powerland</a>. We had to build a new museum from scratch. We completed building 2 miles of track and overhead, a carbarn and have recently completed a Interpretive Center, called Hopemere Station.  </p>
<p>The following Youtube Playlist was made for the OERHS 50th anniversary showing the old museum, the move and building the new museum. Since this video we have built Hopmere station.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><u><b>About the Work and its Author</b></u></p>
<p>At the site of the immunization against Chickenpox appeared a subcutaneous
lump. And a story was once published about a girl in Scotland who had such a
lump, and who also fell in a pit – a pit which pulled her 200 years back in
time. When the locals noticed the raised bump they were convinced that a demon
was hiding inside the swelling…</p>
<p>That was the way the Scots thought 200 years ago…so it shouldn't be too
hard to guess the status of human comprehension 1000 years ago…</p>
<p>Therefore, regarding the Bible – for which 3000 year old archaeological
proof of what is written was recently discovered – it obviously created a need for
innumerable interpretations that were suited to the intellectual abilities of
people living during the different periods after its dissemination <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">- in
the aftermath of many battles and revolutions worldwide, the interpretations of
the Bible underwent far-reaching upheavals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The ""Enlightenment"" moment that commenced about 250 years ago
lead to contradictory changes in the way the 
world looked at religion in general, and specifically at the ways Bible and other religious texts were viewed. The more progressive among the populace
reacted by separating State and Religion, and the less progressive dug their
heels in and held fast to religion – remaining essentially frozen in time.</span><br/></p>
<p>There is no doubt that if King Solomon – the wisest man of all,
according to Jewish tradition – was alive today, he would produce an
interpretation that applied to the world today, while including all the values
of the past…</p>
<p>One of King Solomon's descendants, who goes by the name of <b>Ben
Solomon</b> (son of Solomon) has taken upon himself to fulfill this task, to
write a new interpretation of the Bible. While his interpretation will not
stray even a millimeter from the inherent ideas conveyed in the original text,
it will integrate the past with the future, and provide answers for anyone who
questions or researches using the thinking patterns and intelligence of a man
living in the modern world today.</p>
<p>In other words: An interpretation which will return the Bible to its
place of prominence in every man's personal library, and more important – to
its place of respect in every man's mind. It will serve as a useful tool, as a
source of ideas and information for anyone at all who studies it.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that this is a grandiose project by any standards, and
one which demands reasonable proof of its feasibility before any request for
public funding can be made. The prospectus, if you will, for this tremendous

<p><i><b>2. 
Divine Supervision, or in
other words: Heavenly Intervention.</b></i></p>
<p>The previous chapter ended with
the expulsion of man from the Garden of Eden. But it was only natural that the
Divine supervision or instruction continued in man’s new home on Earth. As the
Bible tells us in Genesis 6, verses 2: <b>“And the sons of God saw the
daughters of man when they were beautifying themselves, and they took for
themselves wives from whomever they chose.” </b>The type of love between man
and God is not unique to this “story”. This style repeats itself, with words
that are even more erotic in the Song of Songs: 1. <b>The Song of Songs, which
is Solomon's.</b>  2<b>. Let him kiss me
with the kisses of his mouth, for your love is better than wine.</b> 3. <b>Because of
the fragrance of your goodly oils, your name is 'oil poured forth.' Therefore,
the maidens loved you...” </b>And there, as in the previous example, the Bible
describes the lofty emotions of satisfaction (and confidence) that man
experiences when he senses that God is supporting him or standing behind him in
everything he does.</p>
<p>But like every good thing, the instruction also
came to an end, and man became totally independent as a dominant presence on
Earth.  Independence that could of course
never be possible with continued instruction, or even with any sort of Heavenly
involvement.  This does not resemble the
interaction between father and son, where the instruction and mentoring can
continue for a lifetime – for a son’s rejection of his father (something which
is quite common…) is nothing like man’s rejection of God. That is to say: Man
can make decisions about his life as an independent entity, only if the
relationship is completely severed. As it is written in Genesis 6, verse 3: <b>And
the Lord said, ""Let My spirit not quarrel forever concerning man, because
he is also flesh…” </b>Perhaps at first glance this sounds cruel, but in fact –
from here on out there is no more Godly mentor and/or Godly protection or
supervision over man on Earth, which destined to transform into the wished or
dreamed of world for future mankind. And meanwhile, he must take his fate in
his hands, within the limitations also defined in Psalm 115, verse 16: <b>The
heavens are heavens of the Lord, but the earth He gave to the children of men.</b></p>
<p>And indeed, disengaging man from Heavenly
supervision requires of him to take full control of his life. However, man’s
wisdom rapidly and quite naturally led him to feed his desires for possession
and mastery, and intensified those desires a thousand fold. Man’s dominance and
simultaneous acts enslavement became the central means of meeting his own needs,
which constantly increased. And with appetite there must come sustenance. In
other words, the strongest ruled, oppressed, robbed, and killed the weakest. As
it is written in Genesis 6, verse 5: <b>And the Lord saw that the evil of man
was great in the earth, and every imagination of his heart was only evil all
the time. </b>So there was no other option but to bring a Flood upon the world.</p>
<p>Over the course of history we have seen many
examples of  <b>“the evil of man was
great”</b>, due to ignorance, due to the desire to control and conquer, and
even due to the mental illness of leaders. So why is that that <b>“the evil of
man was great” </b>we are dealing with was sentenced with a Flood?</p>
<p>The contiguity between the disengagement of
Heavenly supervision from and <b>“the evil of man was great” </b>(just one
verse later) is the key to understanding this issue. The continuation of man’s
enslavement to Divine supervision/protection, even after the official
detachment – constitutes until this day the reason for oppression, robbery, and
killing in the world – and it is all “authorized and permitted”!</p>
<p>For even those who believe – as is the case with
all people everywhere – have needs. But today we realize that what we need
doesn’t drop out of the sky. So evil deeds are committed with the permission of
“God”, and there is no way to stop them other than to wipe out an entire
generation (like the Flood generation).</p>
<p>And we can actually see for ourselves that all of
the evils mentioned above that man committed in the world have decreased in
scope and number in the world, except for those evil acts committed with “God’s
permission” – and they are only increasing. And all of those acts are rooted in
blind subservience to a God that promises – as something that goes without
saying – his supervision and protection. But in the end, it all brings a Flood
upon the world.</p>
<br/><p><b>Introduction and prospectus of the Project </b></p>
<p>Nobody will dispute that the
Jewish Nation is an extraordinary phenomenon in the history of the world. And
what is particularly amazing is the Jewish Nation’s ability to survive for
three thousand, five hundred years, particularly when for two thousand of those
years they were scattered all over the globe - among nations that tried to
force them to forfeit their religion, among nations that ultimately expelled
the Jews from their homes, attacked them in pogroms, habitually murdered,
robbed, and plundered them, and imposed upon them exorbitant taxes and fines. </p>
<p>Along with this incredible
ability to survive comes the fact that 24.5% of the scientists who won the
Noble <span>Prizes (not including Noble
Peace Prizes) are Jews, while Jews only account for 0.2% of the entire
world population. That means that relative to the world population, for every <b>100</b>
Jews who won prizes, only one non-Jew won a prize!</span></p>
<p>And rumor has it around the
globe, that the distribution of wealth among Jews is even proportionally higher
than the number of Nobel Prize winners, to the point where no small number of
people fantasize that the Jews control the world…</p>
<p>But in any case, what is most
impressive is the fact that wherever the Jews ended up in the Diaspora, they
quickly integrated into the most prestigious cultural and economic social
domains and became an influential force – if not <i>the</i> <i>most </i>influential
force – relative to their proportional representation in the general population.</p>
<p>In this book we will determine
whether these phenomena are part of the general plan for the creation of man with
regard to the most important stage of his development: improving his ability to
think independently, which is in fact man’s main goal in the world – <b>and
also</b> <b>the correct way to achieve true happiness as humans</b>.</p>
<p>Unlike what was acceptable in
the past, this book was written using an approach and language style that can be
comprehensible to every person. Concepts and perceptions that have evolved from
human development in our own times are also included. And if you ask what value
today's miniscule accumulation of knowledge has opposite the insights originating
in the great minds of the past, we will quote one of the sages from long ago: <b>""If
a dwarf is placed on the shoulders of a giant, who sees farther? Surely the
dwarf! For the eyes of the dwarf are now higher than the eyes of the giant. So
too, we are dwarfs astride the shoulders of giants…"" </b>Rabbi Yeshaya bar
Mali, Di Trani, the <b>""Rid""</b> (1180 – 1250), one of the greatest
scholars of his time (and among the greatest of the ""Rishonim"" among
Jewish commentators).</p>
<p>The Bible is the most famous
and most widely disseminated creation in the world, and has served (and still
serves) as the basis for the three monotheistic religions, that all believe in
one God, and in fact in the same God. And the followers of these religions, who
account for nearly half of the world's population, each in turn claims to have
found the best way to achieving happiness in life on earth, and even more
importantly, to achieving happiness in the World to Come.</p>
<p>It's true that as time passed,
these religions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) produced a few moredenominations, and each denomination interprets or
understandsthe holy writings slightly (or
extremely) differently. In recent times, university professors have discovered
countless examples that disprove things written in the holy texts.</p>
<p>This book will be earthshaking
for people on both ends of the spectrum, in that it will also challenge the
authenticity of the Bible. Due to the proliferation of so many theories,
interpretations, holy wars, and the building of personal careers, the main idea
inherent in the Bible has gotten lost by the wayside.</p>
<p>Different theories developed
as a result of the widening gap between the established interpretations of the
early scholars, which were considered immutable, and the evolving reality. That
contradicts what is written in the Bible (to be explained later), and even goes
against the aforementioned quoted essay, by the ""RID"", and even what
other scholars wrote even later on.</p>
<p>If we ignore for a moment the
classic interpretations, we will discover that the Bible is not a religious
text at all, but rather contains a continuum of narrative, educational methods,
and iron<span><del>-</del>clad rules, all with the purpose of
guiding and instructing man on how to create an <b>environment</b> conducive to
developing <u>independent thinking!</u> </span></p>
<p><b>The narrative</b> in
the Bible is a way of transmitting messages to man, and the main characteristic
of the narrative is its uncompromising preservation of man's right to free
will, that is part of his very essence. And in fact, the first
""story"" that appears in the Bible, after the breakneck description of
Creation itself, is the text describing how free choice was first awarded to
man (Genesis 3, verses 1-7). In this story, which takes place in the Garden of
Eden, the Creator forbids man from eating fruit from the Tree of Knowledge. But
he doesn't actually prevent man from committing that transgression, and eating
from the forbidden fruit. It's clear that if the Creator did not want to give
man the freedom of choice (to receive wisdom), it never would have happened.
And it's also clear that this was not a case of God testing man, for what can
be gained from testing someone who is only one day old? At that stage, man
couldn't even discern between good and evil.</p>
<p>Therefore, it can also be
understood that when the Biblical story is taken literally, at face value,
there is no one right or wrong answer presented – for if there were, what would
happen to our free choice? And so, one should not be surprised that man won't
get far by trying to understand the literal meaning of a “story”…Here is an
example of how it is possible to learn about a man’s character from just ten
simple words, and how to deal with him accordingly (Genesis 8, verse 21): <b>“the
imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth”</b></p>
<p>Man is automatically driven by
his survival instinct (or “drive”, according to the more accepted terminology),
just like all other living creatures. Once he was granted wisdom (together with
the ceremonial bestowal of free choice) man was transformed into the most
splendid work of Creation - when he acquired the ability to activate his
intellect (consciously), which set him apart from all other creatures on Earth.
The ability to activate his intellect gave man the potential for unlimited
independent thought – and that is the highest ability and goal attributed to
humans in this world.</p>
<p>The complexity of human
creation becomes increasingly complicated when man’s wisdom (which begins to
develop from his youth) is naturally channeled to nurture his inclinations
towards possessiveness and dominance, and intensifies them a thousand times
over. And their influence on man subordinates him, and his subjugation to them
is in total opposition to his innate ability to achieve independent thought
(his mission in life)…</p>
<p>Now we can begin to provide an
initial answer to the question so many deliberate over: “What am I doing here
in this world?”</p>
<p>“I am here to offer human
substance to the world we live in!” Or in simpler language: To succeed in
channeling the wisdom to combat the “animal” tendency, and to overcome it, in
order to change the world into a place suitable for man to live in. There are
no shortcuts. Everything must be accomplished with man’s freedom of choice.</p>
<p>And regarding this matter we
have not made much progress....  Is it
due to man’s lack of desire to part from his “animalistic” traits, or is it
because of the “animalistic” tendency of one man to control another? The
control is manifested either with physical force, as was the case in the first
days of Creation, or with brain power – in the form of persuasion and/or
propagating theories and “ruminations” that send man back to a dawn of Creation
state of ignorance. And the result is the same – most of the world still lives
in environments that prevent the development of independent thought. </p>
<p>In the book we will elaborate
on this topic, and will also touch upon that Biblical suggestions for coping
with man’s inclinations. And also (perhaps for the first time ever), we will
implement innovative logic to deal with the confusion caused by some of the
scholars and researchers that results from the aforementioned “complexities”
which have led man to believe he has created himself. Man has failed to make
the distinction that law-based regularity is the opposite of fortuity or probability.
And therefore: It doesn’t matter how high we throw the parts of an iPhone, nor
does it matter for how many thousands of years we keep trying – the parts will
never fall on each other “by themselves” exactly the way the manufacturer
intended for them to be connected to each other. The phone will never ring…</p>
<p>In order to strike the iron
while it’s still hot, we will illustrate this concept with a “story” or two,
and will be surprised to discover (or not) that everything is connected to one
principle idea: </p>
<p>The “story” of the Flood
describes for us the severe repercussions that can occur when man’s wisdom is
naturally channeled to nurture his inclinations towards possessiveness and
dominance (Genesis 6, verse 5): <b>And the Lord saw that the evil of man was
great in the earth, and every imagination </b>(= instinct)<b> of his heart was
only evil all the time. </b>There was no possible solution other than to bring
a flood upon the land, and to wipe out every living thing on earth, except for
Noah (and his family), who was saved because Noah found favor in the Lord’s
eyes – that is to say: He behaved like a human being. (Genesis 6 – 8).</p>
<p>Without a doubt, the message
that jumps out of the Flood “story” is: a leader of nation that “has no God”
(in terms of law and order) will meet a tragic end.</p>
<p>But what interest does the
Bible have in telling us that building the ark took 120 years – especially when
just a few years would have been enough?</p>
<p>In fact, the practical answer
to this question can be found with the commentators: So that people would
understand the significance of Noah’s actions, and repent. But what is the
message for later generations, and for today?</p>
<p>To answer that question, we
will return to the “ceremonial” words granting the freedom of choice to man, in
Genesis 2, verse 17: <b>“But of the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil you
shall not eat of it, for on the day that you eat thereof, you shall surely
die.” </b>Well, man ate and didn’t die…</p>
<p>But as stated before, according
to the simple interpretation of the “story” itself, man won’t get very far…</p>
<p>The: <b>“you shall surely die”</b>
refers to those who decide to forfeit their right to free will. In other words:
The right to free will that was granted to man is not an option, but rather man
must take initiative and extend his hand to take hold of his fate. Otherwise, his
very life will be in danger. That is to say, Noah survived the Flood, and
together with him anyone else could have been saved, had he only chosen to use
his intelligence and understand the significance of Noah’s actions, and join
him in the ark. And Noah intentionally extended the time of his “actions”
(building the ark) by over 100 years…</p>
<p>Therefore, if we go over our
bloodstained history (until today), we will discover that may evils in the
world could have been prevented, if people would have only taken their fate in
their hands rather than passively sitting and waiting for a heavenly or earthly
agent to save them…</p>
<p>Indeed, the “story” of the
Flood is told in different version is different cultures, but as we have
already begun to understand – the lessons to be learned from this Biblical
“story” have far reaching ramifications even on tomorrow’s reality…</p>
<p>And surely, if we delve a
little bit more into the “story” of the Flood, we will discover that during the
special circumstances of the generation of the Flood, there was still no law
and order in the world. The “story” in fact investigates the ability of the
most righteous man of the generation (in this case Noah) to have a good
influence on his generation (and even on his city, in similar “stories”).  And the conclusion (in all versions) was
negative. That is to say: <b>Isolated individuals</b> do not have the power to
influence the masses. So the world is doomed, and there is nothing to be done
about it?</p>
<p>But actually, the main message
of that “story” is: A man’s wisdom and freedom of choice are not able, in of
themselves, to bring him to state of independent thought – which is his
purpose. Therefore, despite the fact that freedom of choice is mainly expressed
through a total absence of Divine intervention in what happens here on Earth,
there is no reason to rule out (occasional) Divine intervention to save/repair
the world from man’s actions…. Divine intervention occurs at important
junctures in the course of humanity - when without that intervention, the world
would not be able to achieve its purpose.</p>
<p>And in fact, after the reason
for the Divine intervention is made clear to the world, and only the above
mentioned reason, man’s status as a person with free will is reinstated
(Genesis 8, verses 21-22): <b>“…and the
Lord said to Himself, ""I will no longer curse the earth because of man,
for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth, and I will no longer
smite all living things as I have done.</b> <b>So
long as the earth exists, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and
winter, and day and night shall not cease.” </b>That is to say: For as long as the earth exists, the Lord will not punish
or reward man for his actions during his lifetime and everything will occur
according to the laws of nature – so that man will feel confident in choosing
whatever his heart desires – either good or evil, but he will choose!</p>
<p>Therefore,
the Bible consistently explains to man everything happening around him, in
order to give him the opportunity to choose his next moves. For instance:
Genesis 3, verse 22: “Now the Lord God said, <b>""Behold
man has become like one of us, having the ability of knowing good and evil…”  </b>That
is to say, the Bible tells us that man’s wisdom is in fact Divine (infinite).</p>
<p>Genesis
3, verse 24: <b>“And
He drove the man out, and He stationed from the east of the Garden of Eden the
cherubim and the blade of the revolving sword, to guard the way to the Tree of
Life.” </b>That is to say, the Bible tells
us that: Man was banished from the Garden of Eden, and a special guard was
stationed there to prevent him any access to the Tree of Life (the future).</p>
<p>The
three scenarios below, based on three (aforementioned) quotes from the Bible,
should be sufficient to test the innovativeness and moral rectitude of the
messages transmitted to man via Bible narratives (which were authored at least 3,000
years ago).</p>
<p><b>1.<span> 
</span></b>Without a doubt, if someone from the Humanist community had announced 500
years ago that the Divine Creator that religious people believe in doesn’t help
and doesn’t redeem and doesn’t punish, and also doesn’t reward man in this
world: “as long as the earth exists” - he would be burned at the stake or had
his throat slit by sword, or he would have been excommunicated to the end of
his days…</p>
<p><b>2.<span> 
</span></b>And it is likewise certain that if someone would dare to claim 500 years
ago that Man has been blessed with Divine wisdom (infinite) – he would also
have beenburned at the stake or had his throat
slit by sword, or he would have been excommunicated to the end of his days…</p>
<p><b>3.<span>  </span></b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Similarly, if someone would hazard announcing that 500 years ago: It
is not within man’s power (any man) to know what his future brings or the day
of his death – not by reading coffee, or cards, or the stars, or in any other
way (except, of course, the bright future of those who earn a living engaging
in all of those professions), he should be burned at the stake or have his
throat slit by sword, or be excommunicated to the end of his days…</span></p>
<p><b><span>
</span></b></p>
<p><b>Note: This proves that predicting the future has no
advantage over the wise sages of ancient times!</b></p>
<b>
</b><p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Note: This proves that predicting the future has no
advantage over the wise sages of ancient times!</p>
<p>And
now we will state the opposite. The aforementioned lessons to be learned have
been internalized (by some of us), as we understand them in light of
accumulated experiences. But what lessons could have been learned by those
verses back then? Keep on reading!*</p>
<p>How
could Divine intervention have been explained for the next ten generations
after the Flood? (Genesis 11, verses 5 - 7): <b>And
the Lord descended to see the city and the tower that the sons of man had
built. And the Lord said, ""Lo! [they are] one people, and they all have
one language, and this is what they have commenced to do. Now, will it not be
withheld from them, all that they have planned to do? Come, let us descend and
confuse their language, so that one will not understand the language of his
companion."" </b><b>And the
Lord scattered them from there…” </b>But what exactly were
they “punished” for?</p>
<p>One
would think that the response would be just the opposite, for it is good to be
united and build a magnificent world. For is that not the reason that man was
created in the first place? Once again, if we only read into the simple meaning
of the “story” itself, we won’t get very far…</p>
<p>Why
a punishment all of a sudden?</p>
<p>This
is, once again, an instance of Divine intervention in order to repair/save the
entire world. At that time, even more than is the case today, only sinister
dictatorships were able to pursue and partially achieve the goal of having <b>only one ruler</b> over the entire world. And we have already learned
that the man’s mission is to achieve independence, independent thought –
through use of his right to free will, which was ultimately granted him.</p>
<p>Therefore,
by <b>dispersing</b> the population into separate tribe, nations, and
countries, the opportunity for man to utilize his free will was maximized –
from then until today. That is the anticipated fate for all autocratic empires
in the world…</p>
<p>*And
what came next: Dispersing the population into separate nations emphasized the
problem created for man, which was a combination of man’s awareness of his
environment (when he acquired wisdom) together with his lack of knowledge of
what the morrow would bring (the blocked path to the Tree of Life – the
future). This problem caused him to fear anything unfamiliar. And the solution
that man found – from within his state of all-encompassing ignorance – was to
placate or appease any force that seemed stronger than him and/or that might
have some influence on his fate/future. Every nation adopted gods of its own:
human gods, animal gods, celestial god, wood and stone gods, etc.</p>
<p>That is to say:
Different and strange laws and moral standards, which were
""formulated"" by each separate God. So in addition to man's
subjugation to different gods that did not allow man to realize his right to
free choice, the wars and conflicts between the gods with regard to their
different laws and moral standards created a situation that was impossible to
live with at all. (Even today, wars are being ceaselessly fought by the fanatical
Muslims against the entire world, in the name of their own laws and moral
standards.)</p>
<p>The Divine (and
ingenious) solution offered then to man to help him also overcome his
dependence on gods was: <b>Monotheism</b> (Exodus 20, verse 3): “<b>You shall
not have the gods of others in My presence.” </b>Obviously, this is not a case of jealousy or
competition with the stone and wood gods. Rather, this is a way to release man
from his total subjugation to the different gods. This solution was also
intended to do away with the chaos created by the multiplicity of various laws
and moral standards.</p>
<p>Monotheism, which
also came down to the world through Divine intervention – was, once again, an
instance of Divine intervention in order to repair/save the entire world - and
it first happened ten generations after the intervention that occurred during
the “Tower of Babel Generation”.</p>
<p>As a “lesson
learned”, Monotheism and its rules would not be taught/demonstrated by isolated
individuals”, but by an entire nation: <b>the Treasured Nation</b>. This nation would
receive special training to become mentors for the entire world, and would be
dispersed among the other nations after completing the training, and live with
them for hundreds of years. This nation would demonstrate the Monotheistic ways
of conduct in its daily life, and would of course observe all the related laws <b>unconditionally
</b>– uniform laws and
moral standards for the whole world. And they would be the people who would
create the best environment for developing man’s independent thought – which is
man’s ultimate objective in this world. </p>
<p>It is commonly
acknowledged that the beginning of this intervention occurred simultaneously
with man’s involvement in choosing Abraham as the Father of Monotheism – and
his direct descendants were chosen to become the <b>Treasured Nation</b>.</p>
<p>One can reasonably
assume that our forefather Abraham (who was active in approximately 1800 BC)
was not the first person in the world to understand that wooden and stone gods
could not really rule the world, or the first to have faith in one Creator
(Like Malchizedek, “priest to the most High God” – Genesis 14). But he was the
first to understand that God had to be singular and that there is no other, and
that only the laws that come from the one and only God are laws that man can
uphold and accept for himself all in once, collectively. In other words, at
that time (and perhaps until today…), only fear of one God can unify the laws
and moral standards for everyone. This was particularly true regarding the
elite members of society, who were in the habit of choosing a god that was
convenient for them to obey. As it says in Genesis 20, verse 11: And Abraham
said, <b>“For I said, ‘Surely, there is no fear of God in this place, and they
will kill me…’” </b>There was no shortage of gods back then, but who could guess which law or
which god any local leader was loyal to on any given day?</p>
<p>And indeed, Avraham didn’t
only understand that everyone must follow the same laws, but he was a living
example of it for the whole world to see, with his complete willingness to
sacrifice his only son – as he was commanded by God (the law).</p>
<p>Even
those who don’t believe in God will surely agree that there is no educational
method better than accustoming people to follow rules – and especially people
who are used to following their own self-made rules (or those set down by their
“own” god…). And indeed, after successfully passing his final test (binding his
son for sacrifice), Abraham is informed that his descendants have been selected
as the <b>Treasured Nation</b>, as it is written in Genesis 12, verse 18: <b>And through your children shall be blessed
all the nations of the world, because you hearkened to My voice.</b></p>
<p>Thus
far we have provided a few examples of how Biblical narrative can be understood
– every “story” is complemented by the “story” that follows. And their lessons
are still relevant today. This idea is expanded upon in this book, and the
personal world of every reader will be illuminated by what the book has to
offer.</p>
<p>“…the
Bible is not a religious text at all, but rather contains a continuum of
narrative, <b>educational
methods</b>, and iron-clad rules, all with
the purpose of guiding and instructing man on how to create an <b>environment </b>conducive to…”</p>
<p>The <b>educational methods</b> of the Bible – as is the case with the narratives –
are also presented in the language of olden times, but they certainly still
apply to today’s world (and to tomorrow’s…). The educational methods were the
main tool available for training the <b>Treasured
Nation</b>, where the training process
itself served as a real time demonstration for the rest of the world: How to
establish a family (the strict prohibitions against the “family” chaos that was
once so commonplace, especially among slaves), how to set up an equal
opportunity community, and how to build a united nation.</p>
<p>Therefore,
every detail in the training process of the <b>Treasured
Nation</b> was illuminated with a thousand
spotlights, so that every other nation could see and hear, learn and imitate
their behavior, in preparation for the promise made by God to Abraham. To that
end, the descent to Egypt and terrible period of slavery also served as an
example to every other nation or individual who was oppressed or enslaved
(which was, in fact, the state of existence of most of humanity in ancient
times…). For it did not matter what dismal state a person found himself in. His
hope should never waver.</p>
<p>The
climax of the Egypt “story” was the deliverance from Egypt (the release from
bondage in Egypt). According to the Biblical descriptions, this event occurred
about 3,500 years ago, when most of the world was entrenched in a state of
total ignorance and living in caves or temporary dwellings. They established
remote villages without any means of communicating with each other. Even today,
if a person is born into some far-flung tribe in the Amazon rainforest, he will
live in similar conditions. Most of his day will be spent searching for food
for his family – primarily hunting with a sharpened bone as a spearhead…</p>
<p>If
we were to go back to those times, it is certain that ignorance was rampant
because of the difficult living conditions people had to endure – no small
amount of time was spent in battling others to conquer (or defend), capturing
and selling slaves (or freeing them), and burning villages to the ground (or
saving them). Wars between villages and tribes were commonplace, and sometimes
the people associated with a particular village or tribe fought among
themselves. This all created a situation that prevented anyone from learning
anything more than what he needed to survive.</p>
<p>Today
we know that learning requires time and peace of mind. Even the most skillful
teachers and guides will never be able to make their mark if they have no time
to teach, and have no willing students…</p>
<p>And
now, going back to the main “story” line of the Bible, which deals with the
trials and travails of the Children of Israel as they wandered the desert for
40 years: An entire nation of slaves that was released from bondage, and
completely detached from all the suffering it had undergone on a daily basis
for approximately 400 years. A dispersed and scattered nation was gathered from
all its places of dwelling in Egypt, and united within the framework of shared
troubles and hardships. They went on a long journey lasting 40 years, with the
Levites (the teachers) separated from the rest of the nation straight at the
outset… Consequently, how surprising (or not) to discover that this is in fact
the optimal way to learn, to teach, and to formulate a national ethos, without
which its long term existence would be doubtful, if not defunct.</p>
<p>And
what about the ceaseless obstinacy and bitterness expressed by the nation who
left Egypt, against the God who acted so graciously towards them? That is
simply valid evidence of the great difficulties undergone by the dispersed and
scattered slave nation that was at the bottom of humanity's social ladder – as
it struggled to transform itself into a free and united nation that would one
day stand at the forefront of humanity.</p>
<p>The
readers should not take this lightly: Even after more than 200 years of
anti-slavery laws in the United States (laws that were passed only 50 years
later in the Southern States) – and despite human advancement in the USA -
there is still a small group of slave descendants who don't feel like they are
part of the American nation. And they even find it difficult to integrate into
daily life there – even though they have lived there for generations as free
men, in the most developed country in the world.</p>
<p>It
is true that many Bible researchers do not acknowledge all of the events, the
miracles and wonders experienced by the Children of Israel – exactly as they
are related in the Bible. But nobody will deny that these ""stories""
serve as the very necessary ethos for creating a nation out of remnants of
tribes and the mixed multitude that joined them. The ethos that was common to
everyone who left Egypt, and which continued to unify the Nation for another
1000 years in the Land of Israel - and even later when the people were
displaced to thousands of different settlements in the Diapsora. This unifying
ethos continues to accompany the Jewish nation - <span>that was established by the descendants of those former
Egyptian slaves - until today!</span></p>
<p>And
if anyone thinks that building a strong foundation for this nation is a matter
of ancient history, he need only look at what is happening today in the Middle
East, Africa, etc, and what will happen tomorrow or the day after in many of
the European countries…</p>
<p>It
is almost impossible to understand that Bible and its educational methods,
without understanding the time period in question, the period when most of
humanity was exceedingly ignorant and primitive, and when most were slaves. The
free people, or the ""enlightened"" amongst them, believed in or served
dozens (if not hundreds) of gods – and making sacrifices on platforms or in sanctuaries
to please/calm the anger of the gods, or to ensure success, was a central
cultural activity. The sacrifices were made by the kings or important priests.</p>
<p>Now
it should be easy to understand why a significant portion of the Bible
discusses the construction of different elements for the Tabernacle (for God),
and sacrificial offerings, which were actually the main educational method at
that time. We of course must take note of the ""minor"" changes the
Bible introduced into these ceremonies, which in fact made all the difference. </p>
<p>Unlike
sacrifices made by many other cultures at that time, most of the sacrificial
offerings made by men who lived according to the Bible were voluntarily made
based upon each individual's decision to do so. Whether to express thanks or
repent for his sins, sacrificial offerings were an accepted way of placating
God. On the other hand, a person was at the same time taking responsibility for
his actions. (How many people today are willing to publically take
responsibility for their failures?) And it wasn't just about acknowledging
personal responsibility, but also about paying ""atonement"" (out of
his own pocket) for his sins or his successes with the most lucrative currency
of that time: sheep or cattle! Could there have been any better educational
method at that time, for instilling the value of taking personal responsibility
– which also requires independent thought?</p>
<p>It
is important to emphasize that the use of the Tabernacle permanently ended with
the construction of a permanent sanctuary, just as offering sacrifices was
discontinued at the end of the Second Temple Period. When synagogues were
built, prayer replaced sacrifices – as was the case with many more practices
that became outdated with the development of humanity, in the sense of: ""since
the day has passed the sacrifice lapses"" (Brachot Tractate 26a) – meaning:
If the prescribed time for doing something has passed, the opportunity is lost.</p>
<p>Thus
we have demonstrated to some extent the educational methods of the Bible, and
specifically the ideas and understandings behind them, which are still relevant
today. Later, while reading this book in its entirety, these ideas will be
expanded upon for the purpose of applying them to modern life.</p>
<p>""…the Bible is not a religious text at all, but rather
contains a continuum of narrative, educational methods, and <b>iron-clad rules</b>, all with the purpose of guiding and instructing
man on how to create an <b>environment</b> conducive to developing independent thinking!""</p>
<p>Iron
clad rules (the laws) of the Bible – in contrast to the educational methods,
and despite the fact that they are written in a language style no longer in use
– are constant and permanent, and will still be valid tomorrow. The goal of the
rules is to build up and strengthen the best environment possible for
developing independent thought. That environment will provide: </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Freedom to learn together with the obligation to teach society's
children. Freedom to engage in economic activities.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Personal and public responsibilities. </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>National unity and help for the needy individual. </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Maintenance of public servants, and support for the poor. </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Regulations pertaining to the accumulation of personal property (the
right of ownership) together with social justice. </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Laws of work and rest, and even proper behavior towards animals. </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Etc.</p>
<p>Therefore,
it's no wonder that the first sentence (law) in the Bible, in the series of
""laws and ordinances"" deals with freedom – with the release of slaves
(Exodus 21, verses 1 - 2): <b>""And
these are the ordinances that you shall set before them. Should you buy a
Hebrew slave, he shall work [for] six years, and in the seventh [year], he
shall go out to freedom without charge."" </b>Temporary bondage (the temporary denial of freedom) is
part of reality, even today. But how should society deal with a person who
wants to live as a slave for his entire life – that is to say, free of
responsibility regarding his own life?</p>
<p>(Exodus
21, verses 5 - 6): But if the slave says, <b>""I
love my master..I will not go free. His master shall bring him…to the door or
to the doorpost, and…bore his ear with an awl, and he shall serve him
forever."" </b>This iron clad rule
teaches us that despite man's right to free will, he can also choose not to be
free. That is to say: He doesn't want to take responsibility for his actions,
and thereby disrupts the main purpose of his creation and ability to reach
independence and independent thought. Society should condemn such an individual
for all eternity.</p>
<p>Incidentally:
Regarding the purchase of a slave – The intention is to a form of punishment
imposed upon a person who stole or inflicted damage, and who has no way of
making amends to the owner. In the Biblical method of punishment (in the future
we will surely also implement this method), damages are always remunerated, and
in addition, the culprit must also pay the costs of his imprisonment. That
creates a Win-Win situation.</p>
<p>The
commandment to teach one's children, and the learning process itself, are among
the most central iron clad Biblical rules. This commandment is observed today
throughout the entire world (in every modern place), without any deviation, as
the <b>Treasured Nation </b>once demonstrated. As it is written in the book of Deuteronomy,
chapter 6, verse 7: <b>""And
you shall teach them to your sons and speak of them when you sit in your house,
and when you walk on the way, and when you lie down and when you rise up.""</b> This became most apparent at the beginning of the
Middle Ages, when the world was still stuck in total cultural darkness but most
of the Jews had ""University"" degrees from the first plebian
university in the world. It taught: Torah, Mishna, Talmud, Law, Astronomy,
Ethics, Science, Economics, etc, with an almost infinite list of pluralistic
lecturers…</p>
<p>Today
it is clear that the crowning glory of independent thought is the acquisition
of an education. And even clearer is that the Jewish People, in their role as
the Treasured Nation who must guide and educate the world, had an even greater
incentive to invest in studies, so that everyone would recognize their wisdom
and intelligence. As it says in the concluding remarks made by Moses to the
Children of Israel in the book of Deuteronomy (chapter 4, verses 5 – 7): Behold,
<b>""I have taught you
statutes and ordinances, as the Lord, my God, commanded me, to do so in the
midst of the land to which you are coming to possess. </b><b>And you shall keep them and uphold them
for that is your wisdom and your understanding in the eyes of the peoples, who will
hear all these statutes and say, 'Only this great nation is a wise and
understanding people. For what great nation is there that has God so near to
it, as the Lord our God is at all times that we call upon Him?'""</b></p>
<p><u>This
is the key to understanding the reason for the wondrous facts about the Jewish
nation, which can be found in the opening statement of the introduction, regarding
events beginning 3,500 years ago… </u></p>
<p>In
the book itself <span>I will expand on the difference
between a Biblical commandment, which is an iron clad rule for generations to
come, and the commandments that served as educational methods in their times. A
failure to differentiate, or to be more exact – a failure to
understand…ultimately created a separation of ""religion"" and (the
modern) State. ""Religious"" laws, which are in fact the ""laws and
ordinances"" (the iron clad rules) that appear in the Bible, formed the
basis for the modern laws of the Western World. These laws were only applied
about two hundred years ago (in the wake of the French Revolution). Today they
are accepted everywhere in the (free) world.</span></p>
<p>This
failure to differentiate between Biblical commandments and educational methods was
already transpiredonce beforeby a basic mistake made by all of the Monotheistic religious
leaders, including Rabbi Akiva (17-137 C.E), who was one of the greatest Jewish
rabbis living near the time of the destruction of the Second Temple. This mistake
that can only be explained today by Rabbi Akiva's insufficient historical
perspective. We can see that Divine Intervention took place, if only in order
to remove the obstacles that man himself created. These obstacles prevented him
from realizing his right to free will – without which there is no reason for
existence in this world. And realizing one's free will, whether one's intentions
are good or bad, does not lead to Divine Intervention. As it is written in
Genesis 8, verses 21 – 22: <b>""I
will no longer smite all living things as I have done. </b><b>So long as the earth exists, seedtime and
harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease...""</b> But indeed, when man makes bad decisions there are
ramifications, and sometimes they are very serious, as in the case of Rabbi
Akiva: He chose to decree war against the largest and best trained military
force in the world at that time. He thought (mistakenly) that God would
intervene on the side of the just, or on the side of the righteous, or on the
side of those <span>who made the right
choices. </span></p>
<p>This
bad decision, lead to the deaths of Rabbi Akiva and ""24,000"" of his
students, together with a large percentage of the Jewish People. They were
killed, burnt, crucified, taken as captives, and exiled – just as hundreds, and
thousands, and millions of others over the course of generations who ignored
the laws of nature.</p>
<p>And
just like those who ignore the <span>Biblical
warning  </span><b>""you shall surely die""</b> – which has no respite (until today) for
populations who willingly (or unwillingly) avoid taking their fate into their
own hands, and do not make use of their right to choose that was not granted as
an option, but as part of our nature.</p>
<p>Therefore,
it is no wonder that populations that decided to make use of their free will,
and did so correctly (according to the recommendations found in the Bible),
turned their countries into ""Gardens of Eden"". There is no better
proof of this than the increasing flow of people to those countries from places
that are run according to different standards altogether. And in no instance
has the opposite every happened…(<span>an
uncontrollable flow of people to the ""Garden of Eden"" country that
would turn to one that is more like ""Gehinom"" – ""Hell"").</span></p>
<p>A
""Garden of Eden"" is possible after an understanding is reached that
the belief in one God does not obligate the believers to join ranks behind the
god of the <b>""Chosen
People""</b>. As the prophet
Micah clarified (about 700 years before the Common Era) in chapter 4, verse 5: <b>""For all peoples shall go, each one
in the name of his god, but we will go in the name of the Lord…"" </b>That is to say, each People and its beliefs, each
People and its ceremonies according to the traditions they hold close to their
hearts. Because love for God or the desire to be close to Him is the
recommended way to sustain justice and morality in the world. Justice and
morality form the basis for creating the environment necessary for man to
achieve independent thought.</p>
<p>In this
book itself I will explain in depth the advantages of humanity believing in one
God, as well as the significance of creativity/activity from a position of
independent thought – which is the only thing that remains with man for
eternity.</p>

At the site of the immunization against Chickenpox appeared a subcutaneous
lump. And a story was once published about a girl in Scotland who had such a
lump, and who also fell in a pit – a pit which pulled her 200 years back in
time. When the locals noticed the raised bump they were convinced that a demon
was hiding inside the swelling…
That was the way the Scots thought 200 years ago…so it shouldn't be too
hard to guess the status of human comprehension 1000 years ago…
Therefore, regarding the Bible – for which 3000 year old archaeological
proof of what is written was recently discovered – it obviously created a need for
innumerable interpretations that were suited to the intellectual abilities of
people living during the different periods after its dissemination - in
the aftermath of many battles and revolutions worldwide, the interpretations of
the Bible underwent far-reaching upheavals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The ""Enlightenment"" moment that commenced about 250 years ago
lead to contradictory changes in the way the 
world looked at religion in general, and specifically at the ways Bible and other religious texts were viewed. The more progressive among the populace
reacted by separating State and Religion, and the less progressive dug their
heels in and held fast to religion – remaining essentially frozen in time.
There is no doubt that if King Solomon – the wisest man of all,
according to Jewish tradition – was alive today, he would produce an
interpretation that applied to the world today, while including all the values
of the past…
One of King Solomon's descendants, who goes by the name of Ben
Solomon (son of Solomon) has taken upon himself to fulfill this task, to
write a new interpretation of the Bible. While his interpretation will not
stray even a millimeter from the inherent ideas conveyed in the original text,
it will integrate the past with the future, and provide answers for anyone who
questions or researches using the thinking patterns and intelligence of a man
living in the modern world today.
In other words: An interpretation which will return the Bible to its
place of prominence in every man's personal library, and more important – to
its place of respect in every man's mind. It will serve as a useful tool, as a
source of ideas and information for anyone at all who studies it.
There is no doubt that this is a grandiose project by any standards, and
one which demands reasonable proof of its feasibility before any request for
public funding can be made. The prospectus, if you will, for this tremendous
project is attached.

2. 
Divine Supervision, or in
other words: Heavenly Intervention.
The previous chapter ended with
the expulsion of man from the Garden of Eden. But it was only natural that the
Divine supervision or instruction continued in man’s new home on Earth. As the
Bible tells us in Genesis 6, verses 2: “And the sons of God saw the
daughters of man when they were beautifying themselves, and they took for
themselves wives from whomever they chose.” The type of love between man
and God is not unique to this “story”. This style repeats itself, with words
that are even more erotic in the Song of Songs: 1. The Song of Songs, which
is Solomon's.  2. Let him kiss me
with the kisses of his mouth, for your love is better than wine. 3. Because of
the fragrance of your goodly oils, your name is 'oil poured forth.' Therefore,
the maidens loved you...” And there, as in the previous example, the Bible
describes the lofty emotions of satisfaction (and confidence) that man
experiences when he senses that God is supporting him or standing behind him in
everything he does.
But like every good thing, the instruction also
came to an end, and man became totally independent as a dominant presence on
Earth.  Independence that could of course
never be possible with continued instruction, or even with any sort of Heavenly
involvement.  This does not resemble the
interaction between father and son, where the instruction and mentoring can
continue for a lifetime – for a son’s rejection of his father (something which
is quite common…) is nothing like man’s rejection of God. That is to say: Man
can make decisions about his life as an independent entity, only if the
relationship is completely severed. As it is written in Genesis 6, verse 3: And
the Lord said, ""Let My spirit not quarrel forever concerning man, because
he is also flesh…” Perhaps at first glance this sounds cruel, but in fact –
from here on out there is no more Godly mentor and/or Godly protection or
supervision over man on Earth, which destined to transform into the wished or
dreamed of world for future mankind. And meanwhile, he must take his fate in
his hands, within the limitations also defined in Psalm 115, verse 16: The
heavens are heavens of the Lord, but the earth He gave to the children of men.
And indeed, disengaging man from Heavenly
supervision requires of him to take full control of his life. However, man’s
wisdom rapidly and quite naturally led him to feed his desires for possession
and mastery, and intensified those desires a thousand fold. Man’s dominance and
simultaneous acts enslavement became the central means of meeting his own needs,
which constantly increased. And with appetite there must come sustenance. In
other words, the strongest ruled, oppressed, robbed, and killed the weakest. As
it is written in Genesis 6, verse 5: And the Lord saw that the evil of man
was great in the earth, and every imagination of his heart was only evil all
the time. So there was no other option but to bring a Flood upon the world.
Over the course of history we have seen many
examples of  “the evil of man was
great”, due to ignorance, due to the desire to control and conquer, and
even due to the mental illness of leaders. So why is that that “the evil of
man was great” we are dealing with was sentenced with a Flood?
The contiguity between the disengagement of
Heavenly supervision from and “the evil of man was great” (just one
verse later) is the key to understanding this issue. The continuation of man’s
enslavement to Divine supervision/protection, even after the official
detachment – constitutes until this day the reason for oppression, robbery, and
killing in the world – and it is all “authorized and permitted”!
For even those who believe – as is the case with
all people everywhere – have needs. But today we realize that what we need
doesn’t drop out of the sky. So evil deeds are committed with the permission of
“God”, and there is no way to stop them other than to wipe out an entire
generation (like the Flood generation).
And we can actually see for ourselves that all of
the evils mentioned above that man committed in the world have decreased in
scope and number in the world, except for those evil acts committed with “God’s
permission” – and they are only increasing. And all of those acts are rooted in
blind subservience to a God that promises – as something that goes without
saying – his supervision and protection. But in the end, it all brings a Flood
upon the world.
Introduction and prospectus of the Project 
Nobody will dispute that the
Jewish Nation is an extraordinary phenomenon in the history of the world. And
what is particularly amazing is the Jewish Nation’s ability to survive for
three thousand, five hundred years, particularly when for two thousand of those
years they were scattered all over the globe - among nations that tried to
force them to forfeit their religion, among nations that ultimately expelled
the Jews from their homes, attacked them in pogroms, habitually murdered,
robbed, and plundered them, and imposed upon them exorbitant taxes and fines. 
Along with this incredible
ability to survive comes the fact that 24.5% of the scientists who won the
Noble Prizes (not including Noble
Peace Prizes) are Jews, while Jews only account for 0.2% of the entire
world population. That means that relative to the world population, for every 100
Jews who won prizes, only one non-Jew won a prize!
And rumor has it around the
globe, that the distribution of wealth among Jews is even proportionally higher
than the number of Nobel Prize winners, to the point where no small number of
people fantasize that the Jews control the world…
But in any case, what is most
impressive is the fact that wherever the Jews ended up in the Diaspora, they
quickly integrated into the most prestigious cultural and economic social
domains and became an influential force – if not the most influential
force – relative to their proportional representation in the general population.
In this book we will determine
whether these phenomena are part of the general plan for the creation of man with
regard to the most important stage of his development: improving his ability to
think independently, which is in fact man’s main goal in the world – and
also the correct way to achieve true happiness as humans.
Unlike what was acceptable in
the past, this book was written using an approach and language style that can be
comprehensible to every person. Concepts and perceptions that have evolved from
human development in our own times are also included. And if you ask what value
today's miniscule accumulation of knowledge has opposite the insights originating
in the great minds of the past, we will quote one of the sages from long ago: ""If
a dwarf is placed on the shoulders of a giant, who sees farther? Surely the
dwarf! For the eyes of the dwarf are now higher than the eyes of the giant. So
too, we are dwarfs astride the shoulders of giants…"" Rabbi Yeshaya bar
Mali, Di Trani, the ""Rid"" (1180 – 1250), one of the greatest
scholars of his time (and among the greatest of the ""Rishonim"" among
Jewish commentators).
The Bible is the most famous
and most widely disseminated creation in the world, and has served (and still
serves) as the basis for the three monotheistic religions, that all believe in
one God, and in fact in the same God. And the followers of these religions, who
account for nearly half of the world's population, each in turn claims to have
found the best way to achieving happiness in life on earth, and even more
importantly, to achieving happiness in the World to Come.
It's true that as time passed,
these religions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) produced a few moredenominations, and each denomination interprets or
understandsthe holy writings slightly (or
extremely) differently. In recent times, university professors have discovered
countless examples that disprove things written in the holy texts.
This book will be earthshaking
for people on both ends of the spectrum, in that it will also challenge the
authenticity of the Bible. Due to the proliferation of so many theories,
interpretations, holy wars, and the building of personal careers, the main idea
inherent in the Bible has gotten lost by the wayside.
Different theories developed
as a result of the widening gap between the established interpretations of the
early scholars, which were considered immutable, and the evolving reality. That
contradicts what is written in the Bible (to be explained later), and even goes
against the aforementioned quoted essay, by the ""RID"", and even what
other scholars wrote even later on.
If we ignore for a moment the
classic interpretations, we will discover that the Bible is not a religious
text at all, but rather contains a continuum of narrative, educational methods,
and iron-clad rules, all with the purpose of
guiding and instructing man on how to create an environment conducive to
developing independent thinking! 
The narrative in
the Bible is a way of transmitting messages to man, and the main characteristic
of the narrative is its uncompromising preservation of man's right to free
will, that is part of his very essence. And in fact, the first
""story"" that appears in the Bible, after the breakneck description of
Creation itself, is the text describing how free choice was first awarded to
man (Genesis 3, verses 1-7). In this story, which takes place in the Garden of
Eden, the Creator forbids man from eating fruit from the Tree of Knowledge. But
he doesn't actually prevent man from committing that transgression, and eating
from the forbidden fruit. It's clear that if the Creator did not want to give
man the freedom of choice (to receive wisdom), it never would have happened.
And it's also clear that this was not a case of God testing man, for what can
be gained from testing someone who is only one day old? At that stage, man
couldn't even discern between good and evil.
Therefore, it can also be
understood that when the Biblical story is taken literally, at face value,
there is no one right or wrong answer presented – for if there were, what would
happen to our free choice? And so, one should not be surprised that man won't
get far by trying to understand the literal meaning of a “story”…Here is an
example of how it is possible to learn about a man’s character from just ten
simple words, and how to deal with him accordingly (Genesis 8, verse 21): “the
imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth”
Man is automatically driven by
his survival instinct (or “drive”, according to the more accepted terminology),
just like all other living creatures. Once he was granted wisdom (together with
the ceremonial bestowal of free choice) man was transformed into the most
splendid work of Creation - when he acquired the ability to activate his
intellect (consciously), which set him apart from all other creatures on Earth.
The ability to activate his intellect gave man the potential for unlimited
independent thought – and that is the highest ability and goal attributed to
humans in this world.
The complexity of human
creation becomes increasingly complicated when man’s wisdom (which begins to
develop from his youth) is naturally channeled to nurture his inclinations
towards possessiveness and dominance, and intensifies them a thousand times
over. And their influence on man subordinates him, and his subjugation to them
is in total opposition to his innate ability to achieve independent thought
(his mission in life)…
Now we can begin to provide an
initial answer to the question so many deliberate over: “What am I doing here
in this world?”
“I am here to offer human
substance to the world we live in!” Or in simpler language: To succeed in
channeling the wisdom to combat the “animal” tendency, and to overcome it, in
order to change the world into a place suitable for man to live in. There are
no shortcuts. Everything must be accomplished with man’s freedom of choice.
And regarding this matter we
have not made much progress....  Is it
due to man’s lack of desire to part from his “animalistic” traits, or is it
because of the “animalistic” tendency of one man to control another? The
control is manifested either with physical force, as was the case in the first
days of Creation, or with brain power – in the form of persuasion and/or
propagating theories and “ruminations” that send man back to a dawn of Creation
state of ignorance. And the result is the same – most of the world still lives
in environments that prevent the development of independent thought. 
In the book we will elaborate
on this topic, and will also touch upon that Biblical suggestions for coping
with man’s inclinations. And also (perhaps for the first time ever), we will
implement innovative logic to deal with the confusion caused by some of the
scholars and researchers that results from the aforementioned “complexities”
which have led man to believe he has created himself. Man has failed to make
the distinction that law-based regularity is the opposite of fortuity or probability.
And therefore: It doesn’t matter how high we throw the parts of an iPhone, nor
does it matter for how many thousands of years we keep trying – the parts will
never fall on each other “by themselves” exactly the way the manufacturer
intended for them to be connected to each other. The phone will never ring…
In order to strike the iron
while it’s still hot, we will illustrate this concept with a “story” or two,
and will be surprised to discover (or not) that everything is connected to one
principle idea: 
The “story” of the Flood
describes for us the severe repercussions that can occur when man’s wisdom is
naturally channeled to nurture his inclinations towards possessiveness and
dominance (Genesis 6, verse 5): And the Lord saw that the evil of man was
great in the earth, and every imagination (= instinct) of his heart was
only evil all the time. There was no possible solution other than to bring
a flood upon the land, and to wipe out every living thing on earth, except for
Noah (and his family), who was saved because Noah found favor in the Lord’s
eyes – that is to say: He behaved like a human being. (Genesis 6 – 8).
Without a doubt, the message
that jumps out of the Flood “story” is: a leader of nation that “has no God”
(in terms of law and order) will meet a tragic end.
But what interest does the
Bible have in telling us that building the ark took 120 years – especially when
just a few years would have been enough?
In fact, the practical answer
to this question can be found with the commentators: So that people would
understand the significance of Noah’s actions, and repent. But what is the
message for later generations, and for today?
To answer that question, we
will return to the “ceremonial” words granting the freedom of choice to man, in
Genesis 2, verse 17: “But of the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil you
shall not eat of it, for on the day that you eat thereof, you shall surely
die.” Well, man ate and didn’t die…
But as stated before, according
to the simple interpretation of the “story” itself, man won’t get very far…
The: “you shall surely die”
refers to those who decide to forfeit their right to free will. In other words:
The right to free will that was granted to man is not an option, but rather man
must take initiative and extend his hand to take hold of his fate. Otherwise, his
very life will be in danger. That is to say, Noah survived the Flood, and
together with him anyone else could have been saved, had he only chosen to use
his intelligence and understand the significance of Noah’s actions, and join
him in the ark. And Noah intentionally extended the time of his “actions”
(building the ark) by over 100 years…
Therefore, if we go over our
bloodstained history (until today), we will discover that may evils in the
world could have been prevented, if people would have only taken their fate in
their hands rather than passively sitting and waiting for a heavenly or earthly
agent to save them…
Indeed, the “story” of the
Flood is told in different version is different cultures, but as we have
already begun to understand – the lessons to be learned from this Biblical
“story” have far reaching ramifications even on tomorrow’s reality…
And surely, if we delve a
little bit more into the “story” of the Flood, we will discover that during the
special circumstances of the generation of the Flood, there was still no law
and order in the world. The “story” in fact investigates the ability of the
most righteous man of the generation (in this case Noah) to have a good
influence on his generation (and even on his city, in similar “stories”).  And the conclusion (in all versions) was
negative. That is to say: Isolated individuals do not have the power to
influence the masses. So the world is doomed, and there is nothing to be done
about it?
But actually, the main message
of that “story” is: A man’s wisdom and freedom of choice are not able, in of
themselves, to bring him to state of independent thought – which is his
purpose. Therefore, despite the fact that freedom of choice is mainly expressed
through a total absence of Divine intervention in what happens here on Earth,
there is no reason to rule out (occasional) Divine intervention to save/repair
the world from man’s actions…. Divine intervention occurs at important
junctures in the course of humanity - when without that intervention, the world
would not be able to achieve its purpose.
And in fact, after the reason
for the Divine intervention is made clear to the world, and only the above
mentioned reason, man’s status as a person with free will is reinstated
(Genesis 8, verses 21-22): “…and the
Lord said to Himself, ""I will no longer curse the earth because of man,
for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth, and I will no longer
smite all living things as I have done. So
long as the earth exists, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and
winter, and day and night shall not cease.” That is to say: For as long as the earth exists, the Lord will not punish
or reward man for his actions during his lifetime and everything will occur
according to the laws of nature – so that man will feel confident in choosing
whatever his heart desires – either good or evil, but he will choose!
Therefore,
the Bible consistently explains to man everything happening around him, in
order to give him the opportunity to choose his next moves. For instance:
Genesis 3, verse 22: “Now the Lord God said, ""Behold
man has become like one of us, having the ability of knowing good and evil…”  That
is to say, the Bible tells us that man’s wisdom is in fact Divine (infinite).
Genesis
3, verse 24: “And
He drove the man out, and He stationed from the east of the Garden of Eden the
cherubim and the blade of the revolving sword, to guard the way to the Tree of
Life.” That is to say, the Bible tells
us that: Man was banished from the Garden of Eden, and a special guard was
stationed there to prevent him any access to the Tree of Life (the future).
The
three scenarios below, based on three (aforementioned) quotes from the Bible,
should be sufficient to test the innovativeness and moral rectitude of the
messages transmitted to man via Bible narratives (which were authored at least 3,000
years ago).
1. 
Without a doubt, if someone from the Humanist community had announced 500
years ago that the Divine Creator that religious people believe in doesn’t help
and doesn’t redeem and doesn’t punish, and also doesn’t reward man in this
world: “as long as the earth exists” - he would be burned at the stake or had
his throat slit by sword, or he would have been excommunicated to the end of
his days…
2. 
And it is likewise certain that if someone would dare to claim 500 years
ago that Man has been blessed with Divine wisdom (infinite) – he would also
have beenburned at the stake or had his throat
slit by sword, or he would have been excommunicated to the end of his days…
3.  Similarly, if someone would hazard announcing that 500 years ago: It
is not within man’s power (any man) to know what his future brings or the day
of his death – not by reading coffee, or cards, or the stars, or in any other
way (except, of course, the bright future of those who earn a living engaging
in all of those professions), he should be burned at the stake or have his
throat slit by sword, or be excommunicated to the end of his days…


Note: This proves that predicting the future has no
advantage over the wise sages of ancient times!




Note: This proves that predicting the future has no
advantage over the wise sages of ancient times!
And
now we will state the opposite. The aforementioned lessons to be learned have
been internalized (by some of us), as we understand them in light of
accumulated experiences. But what lessons could have been learned by those
verses back then? Keep on reading!*
How
could Divine intervention have been explained for the next ten generations
after the Flood? (Genesis 11, verses 5 - 7): And
the Lord descended to see the city and the tower that the sons of man had
built. And the Lord said, ""Lo! [they are] one people, and they all have
one language, and this is what they have commenced to do. Now, will it not be
withheld from them, all that they have planned to do? Come, let us descend and
confuse their language, so that one will not understand the language of his
companion."" And the
Lord scattered them from there…” But what exactly were
they “punished” for?
One
would think that the response would be just the opposite, for it is good to be
united and build a magnificent world. For is that not the reason that man was
created in the first place? Once again, if we only read into the simple meaning
of the “story” itself, we won’t get very far…
Why
a punishment all of a sudden?
This
is, once again, an instance of Divine intervention in order to repair/save the
entire world. At that time, even more than is the case today, only sinister
dictatorships were able to pursue and partially achieve the goal of having only one ruler over the entire world. And we have already learned
that the man’s mission is to achieve independence, independent thought –
through use of his right to free will, which was ultimately granted him.
Therefore,
by dispersing the population into separate tribe, nations, and
countries, the opportunity for man to utilize his free will was maximized –
from then until today. That is the anticipated fate for all autocratic empires
in the world…
*And
what came next: Dispersing the population into separate nations emphasized the
problem created for man, which was a combination of man’s awareness of his
environment (when he acquired wisdom) together with his lack of knowledge of
what the morrow would bring (the blocked path to the Tree of Life – the
future). This problem caused him to fear anything unfamiliar. And the solution
that man found – from within his state of all-encompassing ignorance – was to
placate or appease any force that seemed stronger than him and/or that might
have some influence on his fate/future. Every nation adopted gods of its own:
human gods, animal gods, celestial god, wood and stone gods, etc.
That is to say:
Different and strange laws and moral standards, which were
""formulated"" by each separate God. So in addition to man's
subjugation to different gods that did not allow man to realize his right to
free choice, the wars and conflicts between the gods with regard to their
different laws and moral standards created a situation that was impossible to
live with at all. (Even today, wars are being ceaselessly fought by the fanatical
Muslims against the entire world, in the name of their own laws and moral
standards.)
The Divine (and
ingenious) solution offered then to man to help him also overcome his
dependence on gods was: Monotheism (Exodus 20, verse 3): “You shall
not have the gods of others in My presence.” Obviously, this is not a case of jealousy or
competition with the stone and wood gods. Rather, this is a way to release man
from his total subjugation to the different gods. This solution was also
intended to do away with the chaos created by the multiplicity of various laws
and moral standards.
Monotheism, which
also came down to the world through Divine intervention – was, once again, an
instance of Divine intervention in order to repair/save the entire world - and
it first happened ten generations after the intervention that occurred during
the “Tower of Babel Generation”.
As a “lesson
learned”, Monotheism and its rules would not be taught/demonstrated by isolated
individuals”, but by an entire nation: the Treasured Nation. This nation would
receive special training to become mentors for the entire world, and would be
dispersed among the other nations after completing the training, and live with
them for hundreds of years. This nation would demonstrate the Monotheistic ways
of conduct in its daily life, and would of course observe all the related laws unconditionally
– uniform laws and
moral standards for the whole world. And they would be the people who would
create the best environment for developing man’s independent thought – which is
man’s ultimate objective in this world. 
It is commonly
acknowledged that the beginning of this intervention occurred simultaneously
with man’s involvement in choosing Abraham as the Father of Monotheism – and
his direct descendants were chosen to become the Treasured Nation.
One can reasonably
assume that our forefather Abraham (who was active in approximately 1800 BC)
was not the first person in the world to understand that wooden and stone gods
could not really rule the world, or the first to have faith in one Creator
(Like Malchizedek, “priest to the most High God” – Genesis 14). But he was the
first to understand that God had to be singular and that there is no other, and
that only the laws that come from the one and only God are laws that man can
uphold and accept for himself all in once, collectively. In other words, at
that time (and perhaps until today…), only fear of one God can unify the laws
and moral standards for everyone. This was particularly true regarding the
elite members of society, who were in the habit of choosing a god that was
convenient for them to obey. As it says in Genesis 20, verse 11: And Abraham
said, “For I said, ‘Surely, there is no fear of God in this place, and they
will kill me…’” There was no shortage of gods back then, but who could guess which law or
which god any local leader was loyal to on any given day?
And indeed, Avraham didn’t
only understand that everyone must follow the same laws, but he was a living
example of it for the whole world to see, with his complete willingness to
sacrifice his only son – as he was commanded by God (the law).
Even
those who don’t believe in God will surely agree that there is no educational
method better than accustoming people to follow rules – and especially people
who are used to following their own self-made rules (or those set down by their
“own” god…). And indeed, after successfully passing his final test (binding his
son for sacrifice), Abraham is informed that his descendants have been selected
as the Treasured Nation, as it is written in Genesis 12, verse 18: And through your children shall be blessed
all the nations of the world, because you hearkened to My voice.
Thus
far we have provided a few examples of how Biblical narrative can be understood
– every “story” is complemented by the “story” that follows. And their lessons
are still relevant today. This idea is expanded upon in this book, and the
personal world of every reader will be illuminated by what the book has to
offer.
“…the
Bible is not a religious text at all, but rather contains a continuum of
narrative, educational
methods, and iron-clad rules, all with
the purpose of guiding and instructing man on how to create an environment conducive to…”
The educational methods of the Bible – as is the case with the narratives –
are also presented in the language of olden times, but they certainly still
apply to today’s world (and to tomorrow’s…). The educational methods were the
main tool available for training the Treasured
Nation, where the training process
itself served as a real time demonstration for the rest of the world: How to
establish a family (the strict prohibitions against the “family” chaos that was
once so commonplace, especially among slaves), how to set up an equal
opportunity community, and how to build a united nation.
Therefore,
every detail in the training process of the Treasured
Nation was illuminated with a thousand
spotlights, so that every other nation could see and hear, learn and imitate
their behavior, in preparation for the promise made by God to Abraham. To that
end, the descent to Egypt and terrible period of slavery also served as an
example to every other nation or individual who was oppressed or enslaved
(which was, in fact, the state of existence of most of humanity in ancient
times…). For it did not matter what dismal state a person found himself in. His
hope should never waver.
The
climax of the Egypt “story” was the deliverance from Egypt (the release from
bondage in Egypt). According to the Biblical descriptions, this event occurred
about 3,500 years ago, when most of the world was entrenched in a state of
total ignorance and living in caves or temporary dwellings. They established
remote villages without any means of communicating with each other. Even today,
if a person is born into some far-flung tribe in the Amazon rainforest, he will
live in similar conditions. Most of his day will be spent searching for food
for his family – primarily hunting with a sharpened bone as a spearhead…
If
we were to go back to those times, it is certain that ignorance was rampant
because of the difficult living conditions people had to endure – no small
amount of time was spent in battling others to conquer (or defend), capturing
and selling slaves (or freeing them), and burning villages to the ground (or
saving them). Wars between villages and tribes were commonplace, and sometimes
the people associated with a particular village or tribe fought among
themselves. This all created a situation that prevented anyone from learning
anything more than what he needed to survive.
Today
we know that learning requires time and peace of mind. Even the most skillful
teachers and guides will never be able to make their mark if they have no time
to teach, and have no willing students…
And
now, going back to the main “story” line of the Bible, which deals with the
trials and travails of the Children of Israel as they wandered the desert for
40 years: An entire nation of slaves that was released from bondage, and
completely detached from all the suffering it had undergone on a daily basis
for approximately 400 years. A dispersed and scattered nation was gathered from
all its places of dwelling in Egypt, and united within the framework of shared
troubles and hardships. They went on a long journey lasting 40 years, with the
Levites (the teachers) separated from the rest of the nation straight at the
outset… Consequently, how surprising (or not) to discover that this is in fact
the optimal way to learn, to teach, and to formulate a national ethos, without
which its long term existence would be doubtful, if not defunct.
And
what about the ceaseless obstinacy and bitterness expressed by the nation who
left Egypt, against the God who acted so graciously towards them? That is
simply valid evidence of the great difficulties undergone by the dispersed and
scattered slave nation that was at the bottom of humanity's social ladder – as
it struggled to transform itself into a free and united nation that would one
day stand at the forefront of humanity.
The
readers should not take this lightly: Even after more than 200 years of
anti-slavery laws in the United States (laws that were passed only 50 years
later in the Southern States) – and despite human advancement in the USA -
there is still a small group of slave descendants who don't feel like they are
part of the American nation. And they even find it difficult to integrate into
daily life there – even though they have lived there for generations as free
men, in the most developed country in the world.
It
is true that many Bible researchers do not acknowledge all of the events, the
miracles and wonders experienced by the Children of Israel – exactly as they
are related in the Bible. But nobody will deny that these ""stories""
serve as the very necessary ethos for creating a nation out of remnants of
tribes and the mixed multitude that joined them. The ethos that was common to
everyone who left Egypt, and which continued to unify the Nation for another
1000 years in the Land of Israel - and even later when the people were
displaced to thousands of different settlements in the Diapsora. This unifying
ethos continues to accompany the Jewish nation - that was established by the descendants of those former
Egyptian slaves - until today!
And
if anyone thinks that building a strong foundation for this nation is a matter
of ancient history, he need only look at what is happening today in the Middle
East, Africa, etc, and what will happen tomorrow or the day after in many of
the European countries…
It
is almost impossible to understand that Bible and its educational methods,
without understanding the time period in question, the period when most of
humanity was exceedingly ignorant and primitive, and when most were slaves. The
free people, or the ""enlightened"" amongst them, believed in or served
dozens (if not hundreds) of gods – and making sacrifices on platforms or in sanctuaries
to please/calm the anger of the gods, or to ensure success, was a central
cultural activity. The sacrifices were made by the kings or important priests.
Now
it should be easy to understand why a significant portion of the Bible
discusses the construction of different elements for the Tabernacle (for God),
and sacrificial offerings, which were actually the main educational method at
that time. We of course must take note of the ""minor"" changes the
Bible introduced into these ceremonies, which in fact made all the difference. 
Unlike
sacrifices made by many other cultures at that time, most of the sacrificial
offerings made by men who lived according to the Bible were voluntarily made
based upon each individual's decision to do so. Whether to express thanks or
repent for his sins, sacrificial offerings were an accepted way of placating
God. On the other hand, a person was at the same time taking responsibility for
his actions. (How many people today are willing to publically take
responsibility for their failures?) And it wasn't just about acknowledging
personal responsibility, but also about paying ""atonement"" (out of
his own pocket) for his sins or his successes with the most lucrative currency
of that time: sheep or cattle! Could there have been any better educational
method at that time, for instilling the value of taking personal responsibility
– which also requires independent thought?
It
is important to emphasize that the use of the Tabernacle permanently ended with
the construction of a permanent sanctuary, just as offering sacrifices was
discontinued at the end of the Second Temple Period. When synagogues were
built, prayer replaced sacrifices – as was the case with many more practices
that became outdated with the development of humanity, in the sense of: ""since
the day has passed the sacrifice lapses"" (Brachot Tractate 26a) – meaning:
If the prescribed time for doing something has passed, the opportunity is lost.
Thus
we have demonstrated to some extent the educational methods of the Bible, and
specifically the ideas and understandings behind them, which are still relevant
today. Later, while reading this book in its entirety, these ideas will be
expanded upon for the purpose of applying them to modern life.
""…the Bible is not a religious text at all, but rather
contains a continuum of narrative, educational methods, and iron-clad rules, all with the purpose of guiding and instructing
man on how to create an environment conducive to developing independent thinking!""
Iron
clad rules (the laws) of the Bible – in contrast to the educational methods,
and despite the fact that they are written in a language style no longer in use
– are constant and permanent, and will still be valid tomorrow. The goal of the
rules is to build up and strengthen the best environment possible for
developing independent thought. That environment will provide: 
· 
Freedom to learn together with the obligation to teach society's
children. Freedom to engage in economic activities.
· 
Personal and public responsibilities. 
· 
National unity and help for the needy individual. 
· 
Maintenance of public servants, and support for the poor. 
· 
Regulations pertaining to the accumulation of personal property (the
right of ownership) together with social justice. 
· 
Laws of work and rest, and even proper behavior towards animals. 
· 
Etc.
Therefore,
it's no wonder that the first sentence (law) in the Bible, in the series of
""laws and ordinances"" deals with freedom – with the release of slaves
(Exodus 21, verses 1 - 2): ""And
these are the ordinances that you shall set before them. Should you buy a
Hebrew slave, he shall work [for] six years, and in the seventh [year], he
shall go out to freedom without charge."" Temporary bondage (the temporary denial of freedom) is
part of reality, even today. But how should society deal with a person who
wants to live as a slave for his entire life – that is to say, free of
responsibility regarding his own life?
(Exodus
21, verses 5 - 6): But if the slave says, ""I
love my master..I will not go free. His master shall bring him…to the door or
to the doorpost, and…bore his ear with an awl, and he shall serve him
forever."" This iron clad rule
teaches us that despite man's right to free will, he can also choose not to be
free. That is to say: He doesn't want to take responsibility for his actions,
and thereby disrupts the main purpose of his creation and ability to reach
independence and independent thought. Society should condemn such an individual
for all eternity.
Incidentally:
Regarding the purchase of a slave – The intention is to a form of punishment
imposed upon a person who stole or inflicted damage, and who has no way of
making amends to the owner. In the Biblical method of punishment (in the future
we will surely also implement this method), damages are always remunerated, and
in addition, the culprit must also pay the costs of his imprisonment. That
creates a Win-Win situation.
The
commandment to teach one's children, and the learning process itself, are among
the most central iron clad Biblical rules. This commandment is observed today
throughout the entire world (in every modern place), without any deviation, as
the Treasured Nation once demonstrated. As it is written in the book of Deuteronomy,
chapter 6, verse 7: ""And
you shall teach them to your sons and speak of them when you sit in your house,
and when you walk on the way, and when you lie down and when you rise up."" This became most apparent at the beginning of the
Middle Ages, when the world was still stuck in total cultural darkness but most
of the Jews had ""University"" degrees from the first plebian
university in the world. It taught: Torah, Mishna, Talmud, Law, Astronomy,
Ethics, Science, Economics, etc, with an almost infinite list of pluralistic
lecturers…
Today
it is clear that the crowning glory of independent thought is the acquisition
of an education. And even clearer is that the Jewish People, in their role as
the Treasured Nation who must guide and educate the world, had an even greater
incentive to invest in studies, so that everyone would recognize their wisdom
and intelligence. As it says in the concluding remarks made by Moses to the
Children of Israel in the book of Deuteronomy (chapter 4, verses 5 – 7): Behold,
""I have taught you
statutes and ordinances, as the Lord, my God, commanded me, to do so in the
midst of the land to which you are coming to possess. And you shall keep them and uphold them
for that is your wisdom and your understanding in the eyes of the peoples, who will
hear all these statutes and say, 'Only this great nation is a wise and
understanding people. For what great nation is there that has God so near to
it, as the Lord our God is at all times that we call upon Him?'""
This
is the key to understanding the reason for the wondrous facts about the Jewish
nation, which can be found in the opening statement of the introduction, regarding
events beginning 3,500 years ago… 
In
the book itself I will expand on the difference
between a Biblical commandment, which is an iron clad rule for generations to
come, and the commandments that served as educational methods in their times. A
failure to differentiate, or to be more exact – a failure to
understand…ultimately created a separation of ""religion"" and (the
modern) State. ""Religious"" laws, which are in fact the ""laws and
ordinances"" (the iron clad rules) that appear in the Bible, formed the
basis for the modern laws of the Western World. These laws were only applied
about two hundred years ago (in the wake of the French Revolution). Today they
are accepted everywhere in the (free) world.
This
failure to differentiate between Biblical commandments and educational methods was
already transpiredonce beforeby a basic mistake made by all of the Monotheistic religious
leaders, including Rabbi Akiva (17-137 C.E), who was one of the greatest Jewish
rabbis living near the time of the destruction of the Second Temple. This mistake
that can only be explained today by Rabbi Akiva's insufficient historical
perspective. We can see that Divine Intervention took place, if only in order
to remove the obstacles that man himself created. These obstacles prevented him
from realizing his right to free will – without which there is no reason for
existence in this world. And realizing one's free will, whether one's intentions
are good or bad, does not lead to Divine Intervention. As it is written in
Genesis 8, verses 21 – 22: ""I
will no longer smite all living things as I have done. So long as the earth exists, seedtime and
harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease..."" But indeed, when man makes bad decisions there are
ramifications, and sometimes they are very serious, as in the case of Rabbi
Akiva: He chose to decree war against the largest and best trained military
force in the world at that time. He thought (mistakenly) that God would
intervene on the side of the just, or on the side of the righteous, or on the
side of those who made the right
choices. 
This
bad decision, lead to the deaths of Rabbi Akiva and ""24,000"" of his
students, together with a large percentage of the Jewish People. They were
killed, burnt, crucified, taken as captives, and exiled – just as hundreds, and
thousands, and millions of others over the course of generations who ignored
the laws of nature.
And
just like those who ignore the Biblical
warning  ""you shall surely die"" – which has no respite (until today) for
populations who willingly (or unwillingly) avoid taking their fate into their
own hands, and do not make use of their right to choose that was not granted as
an option, but as part of our nature.
Therefore,
it is no wonder that populations that decided to make use of their free will,
and did so correctly (according to the recommendations found in the Bible),
turned their countries into ""Gardens of Eden"". There is no better
proof of this than the increasing flow of people to those countries from places
that are run according to different standards altogether. And in no instance
has the opposite every happened…(an
uncontrollable flow of people to the ""Garden of Eden"" country that
would turn to one that is more like ""Gehinom"" – ""Hell"").
A
""Garden of Eden"" is possible after an understanding is reached that
the belief in one God does not obligate the believers to join ranks behind the
god of the ""Chosen
People"". As the prophet
Micah clarified (about 700 years before the Common Era) in chapter 4, verse 5: ""For all peoples shall go, each one
in the name of his god, but we will go in the name of the Lord…"" That is to say, each People and its beliefs, each
People and its ceremonies according to the traditions they hold close to their
hearts. Because love for God or the desire to be close to Him is the
recommended way to sustain justice and morality in the world. Justice and
morality form the basis for creating the environment necessary for man to
achieve independent thought.
In this
book itself I will explain in depth the advantages of humanity believing in one
God, as well as the significance of creativity/activity from a position of
independent thought – which is the only thing that remains with man for
eternity.
Pleasant

</p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>The
first steps</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>In
the autumn of 2014 some families in Paks region, Tolna county,
Hungary met and began to talk about a new way of education there.
Their dream was to found a Waldorf kindergarten and elementary school
in the region. 
</p>
<p>In the Paks Region of Hungary (in Tolna
county, which is one of the poorest and less developed counties of our country) there is
only one kind of education - maintained and ruled by the state. State schools are year by year more strict and the teaching method is completely against children's natural needs - deals only with the lexical knowledge and keeps children between very strict walls, there's nothing to do with creativity, community, social activities and the mind's freedom. <br/></p><p>Waldorf Education is based on an understanding of human development that
 addresses the needs of the growing child. Waldorf teachers strive to 
transform education into an art that educates the whole child—the heart 
and the hands, as well as the head.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437248391/oofqcsdeqhoiwv3wtjzh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p>When you enter a Waldorf school, the first thing you may notice is 
the care given to the building. The walls are usually painted in lively 
colors and are adorned with student artwork. Evidence of student 
activity is everywhere to be found and every desk holds a uniquely 
created main lesson book.</p><p>Another first impression may be the 
enthusiasm and commitment of the teachers you meet. These teachers are 
interested in the students as individuals. They are interested in the 
questions:</p><ul>
<li>How do we establish within each child his or her own high level of academic excellence?</li>
<li>How
 do we call forth enthusiasm for learning and work, a healthy 
self-awareness, interest and concern for fellow human beings, and a 
respect for the world?</li>
<li>How can we help pupils find meaning in their lives?</li>
</ul>All these facts led these families to take the serious decision and risk and started to think and work on a project to bring this alternative education for their
own and the area's children and families.
<p>Only
few months passed and more families joined the founders and they all
agreed on the aim: building a real Waldorf institution in this region.</p><p><br/></p><p><b></b></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437250845/bz3pdoamv6qxlsdmzlms.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><b>The
Goldfish Waldorf Association</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>The
idea of the foundation was born in September 2014
and in January 2015 ten families and a Waldorf teacher founded the
nonprofit Goldfish Waldorf Association (GWA) which would run the
institution. Since then the number of the members is rising and more and more parents and teachers join the work. <br/></p><p>One of
the most important things was to find the right place for the institution.
The solution occurred in March: the local government of the town Paks offered
the association the old school building of Dunakömlőd
(which town belongs to Paks) for renting.</p>
<p>The
villigers were delighted to hear about the new school because the
building had not been used for twelwe years and therefore the village's future turned into a bad direction - where you can't find good education, sooner or later that place will be empty. 
</p>
<p>The community has a busy summer now, parents and volunteers are ready to work because there are a lot of things to do. The places for the children in the
kindergarden and the first class need to be built and equipped and garden needs to be cleaned and arranged. We would like to open the door this september if possible, 25 children with their families are waiting at this moment to start this ""mission"" and to show that it is possible to do life and education on a different way.</p><p>“Our highest endeavor must be to develop free human beings who are able 
of themselves to impart purpose and direction to their lives. The need 
for imagination, a sense of truth, and a feeling of responsibility—these
 three forces are the very nerve of education.”

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Waldorf

<li>
<p>Waldorf
	is social experience not for the children only but for the parents

</li>
<li>
<p>Three

	the maintaining association (GWA).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The
	role of the community is more obvious when founding a new

	world. Parents work on the accomplishment of the future institution.

</li>
<li>
<p>There
	is no owner who would want profit.

</li>
<li>
<p>There

</p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Future
of the Goldfish Waldorf </b>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There
will be eight classes at the elementary school and one group at the
kindergarten, so approximately 180 children are going to attend our
school. It will be like an original Waldorf: natural and harmonic,
where it is happy to enter for both children and parents. We believe
that it will remind everyone of the morale it was born with:
enthusiasm, love of life, desire to do, harmony, acceptance and most
importantly the devotion to children in the area. <br/></p><p>And last but not least, it is a chance for families to form a community of people which thinks and takes breath together upon good and noble thoughts, makes social activities for the children and therefore for the better and democratic future of our country in the heart of Europe.<br/></p>

</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Esély
Gyermekeinknek</b></p>
<p><b>A
kezdetek:</b></p>
<p>2014
őszén
összesodort néhány paksi és Paks környéki családot az élet, s
beszélgetéseik egyre inkább egy irányba indultak: egyetértettek
abban, hogy gyermekeiket Waldorf intézménybe szeretnék járatni,
és abban is, hogy ez lehetőleg ne járjon utazással a kicsiknek. <br/>A paksi kistérségben állami- és egyházi oktatási formákat választhatnak az itt élők, egyetlen alternatív iskola sincs. <br/>Mindössze néhány hónap
alatt az alapítókhoz
új
családok csatlakoztak, akik határozottan vallották: Waldorf
intézményt akarnak Pakson. 
</p>
<p><b>Az
Aranyhal Waldorf Egyesület:</b></p>
<p>Az
alapítvány ötlete 2014
szeptemberében született. 2015 januárjában tíz
család és egy Waldorf tanár megalapították
az intézmény majdani fenntartóját,
a nonprofit Aranyhal Waldorf Egyesületet. A létszám azóta
is folyamatosan bővül, amint
egyre többen, szülők és
pedagógusok kapcsolódnak
be a munkába. Az egyik legfontosabb teendő
az óvoda és iskola helyszínének
megtalálása volt. Márciusban megszületett a megoldás: Paks Város
Önkormányzata felajánlotta, hogy bérbe adja az egyesületnek a
régi dunakömlődi iskolát. A
falubeliek nagy örömmel fogadták, az óvodáról,
és iskoláról szóló
hírt, az iskolaépületet
ugyanis már több mint egy évtizede nem használták. Sűrű
nyár vár ezért az Aranyhal Waldorf formálódó
szülői közösségére, a
komplexumban ki kell alakítani
az óvoda és az iskola első
osztályát befogadó részeket,
és rendbe kell tenni a kertet.</p>
<p><b>Miben
más a Waldorf? </b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Különbözik
	a hagyományos oktatási módtól,
	mivel a Waldorf pedagógia
	teljes mértékben gyermekközpontú.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A
	Waldorf közösségi élmény mind a gyermekek, mind a szülők
	részére.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A már
	működő
	óvodákat, és iskolákat 3
	egyenrangú pillér harmóniája
	tartja egyensúlyban: a
	pedagógusoké, szülőké,
	és a fenntartó egyesületé.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Az
	intézmény alapításakor a
	közösség szerepe még nyilvánvalóbb:
	a Waldorf intézmények a világon mindenhol szülői
	kezdeményezésre jönnek létre, a szülők
	dolgoznak azon, hogy az első
	gondolattól az utolsó
	szögig minden a helyére kerüljön, a majdani óvodában,
	és iskolában. 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nincs
	tulajdonos, aki profitot várna. 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nincs
	döntéshozó, előíró
	grémium vagy szerv.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a
	szülők közössége dönti el,
	a szülők közös felelőssége,
	hogy hogyan és milyen intézmény születik a munkájukból.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>Pontosan
így történik ez az Aranyhal
Waldorf esetében is.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Az
Aranyhal Waldorf jöv</b><b>ő</b><b>je</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Egészen
biztosan lesz öt évfolyam, és legalább egy óvodai
csoport, azaz mint egy száz gyerek jár majd ide. Ízig-vérig
Waldorf lesz: természetes és harmonikus, ahová öröm belépni
felnőttnek és gyereknek
egyaránt. Hiszünk abban, hogy magán viseli majd az alapító
közösség keze nyomát, s hangulata felidézi majd azt, ahogyan
született: a lelkesedést, az életörömöt, a tenni akarást, a
be- és elfogadást és főként
a gyermekek iránti odaadást.</p>

Waldorf:Chance
for our Children in the Eastern Heart of Europe


The
first steps

In
the autumn of 2014 some families in Paks region, Tolna county,
Hungary met and began to talk about a new way of education there.
Their dream was to found a Waldorf kindergarten and elementary school
in the region. 

In the Paks Region of Hungary (in Tolna
county, which is one of the poorest and less developed counties of our country) there is
only one kind of education - maintained and ruled by the state. State schools are year by year more strict and the teaching method is completely against children's natural needs - deals only with the lexical knowledge and keeps children between very strict walls, there's nothing to do with creativity, community, social activities and the mind's freedom. Waldorf Education is based on an understanding of human development that
 addresses the needs of the growing child. Waldorf teachers strive to 
transform education into an art that educates the whole child—the heart 
and the hands, as well as the head.When you enter a Waldorf school, the first thing you may notice is 
the care given to the building. The walls are usually painted in lively 
colors and are adorned with student artwork. Evidence of student 
activity is everywhere to be found and every desk holds a uniquely 
created main lesson book.Another first impression may be the 
enthusiasm and commitment of the teachers you meet. These teachers are 
interested in the students as individuals. They are interested in the 
questions:
How do we establish within each child his or her own high level of academic excellence?
How
 do we call forth enthusiasm for learning and work, a healthy 
self-awareness, interest and concern for fellow human beings, and a 
respect for the world?
How can we help pupils find meaning in their lives?
All these facts led these families to take the serious decision and risk and started to think and work on a project to bring this alternative education for their
own and the area's children and families.
Only
few months passed and more families joined the founders and they all
agreed on the aim: building a real Waldorf institution in this region.The
Goldfish Waldorf Association

The
idea of the foundation was born in September 2014
and in January 2015 ten families and a Waldorf teacher founded the
nonprofit Goldfish Waldorf Association (GWA) which would run the
institution. Since then the number of the members is rising and more and more parents and teachers join the work. One of
the most important things was to find the right place for the institution.
The solution occurred in March: the local government of the town Paks offered
the association the old school building of Dunakömlőd
(which town belongs to Paks) for renting.
The
villigers were delighted to hear about the new school because the
building had not been used for twelwe years and therefore the village's future turned into a bad direction - where you can't find good education, sooner or later that place will be empty. 

The community has a busy summer now, parents and volunteers are ready to work because there are a lot of things to do. The places for the children in the
kindergarden and the first class need to be built and equipped and garden needs to be cleaned and arranged. We would like to open the door this september if possible, 25 children with their families are waiting at this moment to start this ""mission"" and to show that it is possible to do life and education on a different way.“Our highest endeavor must be to develop free human beings who are able 
of themselves to impart purpose and direction to their lives. The need 
for imagination, a sense of truth, and a feeling of responsibility—these
 three forces are the very nerve of education.”
    ―
    Rudolf Steiner

Why
is Waldorf different?



Waldorf
	pedagogy
	is completely child-focused. 
	


Waldorf
	is social experience not for the children only but for the parents
	as well.


Three
	equal pillars operate Waldorf institutions: pedagogues, parents and
	the maintaining association (GWA).


The
	role of the community is more obvious when founding a new
	institution: Waldorf initiations are made by parents all over the
	world. Parents work on the accomplishment of the future institution.
	
	


There
	is no owner who would want profit. 
	


There
	is no regulatory department, it is completely self-governing.


The
	parents decide what kind of institution they want and it is their
	responsibility as well.



This
is how it works with the GWA too.

Future
of the Goldfish Waldorf 


There
will be eight classes at the elementary school and one group at the
kindergarten, so approximately 180 children are going to attend our
school. It will be like an original Waldorf: natural and harmonic,
where it is happy to enter for both children and parents. We believe
that it will remind everyone of the morale it was born with:
enthusiasm, love of life, desire to do, harmony, acceptance and most
importantly the devotion to children in the area. And last but not least, it is a chance for families to form a community of people which thinks and takes breath together upon good and noble thoughts, makes social activities for the children and therefore for the better and democratic future of our country in the heart of Europe.

What
will the funds be used for?

Our
goal of $50,000 would be used for the following:


renovating
	an old school building (painting, changing windows...)

repairing
	the electricity (lamps, connectors...)
repairing the watering system and bathrooms

equipping
	the canteen (cutlery, chairs, tables...)

creating and equipping an art room and room for wood-works
buying a piano and musical equipments to a music room
creating a community space for performances, feasts and social activities
creating a room for eurythmy (a special important subject in waldorf education)
doing and arranging
	the garden (cleaning, planting, building raised beds for vegetables and flowers)
renting a school bus
equipping the PE room

In Hungarian: 

Aranyhal
Waldorf 

Esély
Gyermekeinknek
A
kezdetek:
2014
őszén
összesodort néhány paksi és Paks környéki családot az élet, s
beszélgetéseik egyre inkább egy irányba indultak: egyetértettek
abban, hogy gyermekeiket Waldorf intézménybe szeretnék járatni,
és abban is, hogy ez lehetőleg ne járjon utazással a kicsiknek. A paksi kistérségben állami- és egyházi oktatási formákat választhatnak az itt élők, egyetlen alternatív iskola sincs. Mindössze néhány hónap
alatt az alapítókhoz
új
családok csatlakoztak, akik határozottan vallották: Waldorf
intézményt akarnak Pakson. 

Az
Aranyhal Waldorf Egyesület:
Az
alapítvány ötlete 2014
szeptemberében született. 2015 januárjában tíz
család és egy Waldorf tanár megalapították
az intézmény majdani fenntartóját,
a nonprofit Aranyhal Waldorf Egyesületet. A létszám azóta
is folyamatosan bővül, amint
egyre többen, szülők és
pedagógusok kapcsolódnak
be a munkába. Az egyik legfontosabb teendő
az óvoda és iskola helyszínének
megtalálása volt. Márciusban megszületett a megoldás: Paks Város
Önkormányzata felajánlotta, hogy bérbe adja az egyesületnek a
régi dunakömlődi iskolát. A
falubeliek nagy örömmel fogadták, az óvodáról,
és iskoláról szóló
hírt, az iskolaépületet
ugyanis már több mint egy évtizede nem használták. Sűrű
nyár vár ezért az Aranyhal Waldorf formálódó
szülői közösségére, a
komplexumban ki kell alakítani
az óvoda és az iskola első
osztályát befogadó részeket,
és rendbe kell tenni a kertet.
Miben
más a Waldorf? 



Különbözik
	a hagyományos oktatási módtól,
	mivel a Waldorf pedagógia
	teljes mértékben gyermekközpontú.


A
	Waldorf közösségi élmény mind a gyermekek, mind a szülők
	részére.


A már
	működő
	óvodákat, és iskolákat 3
	egyenrangú pillér harmóniája
	tartja egyensúlyban: a
	pedagógusoké, szülőké,
	és a fenntartó egyesületé.


Az
	intézmény alapításakor a
	közösség szerepe még nyilvánvalóbb:
	a Waldorf intézmények a világon mindenhol szülői
	kezdeményezésre jönnek létre, a szülők
	dolgoznak azon, hogy az első
	gondolattól az utolsó
	szögig minden a helyére kerüljön, a majdani óvodában,
	és iskolában. 
	


Nincs
	tulajdonos, aki profitot várna. 
	


Nincs
	döntéshozó, előíró
	grémium vagy szerv.


a
	szülők közössége dönti el,
	a szülők közös felelőssége,
	hogy hogyan és milyen intézmény születik a munkájukból.




Pontosan
így történik ez az Aranyhal
Waldorf esetében is.


Az
Aranyhal Waldorf jövője


Egészen
biztosan lesz öt évfolyam, és legalább egy óvodai
csoport, azaz mint egy száz gyerek jár majd ide. Ízig-vérig
Waldorf lesz: természetes és harmonikus, ahová öröm belépni
felnőttnek és gyereknek
egyaránt. Hiszünk abban, hogy magán viseli majd az alapító
közösség keze nyomát, s hangulata felidézi majd azt, ahogyan
született: a lelkesedést, az életörömöt, a tenni akarást, a
be- és elfogadást és főként
a gyermekek iránti odaadást.


Mire
fordítjuk
a pénzt?


A 50.000 dolláros célunkat a következőkre
használnánk:


a
	régi iskolaépület felújítsa
	(festés, ablakcserék…)


iskolai
	felszerelések beszerzése (bútorok,
	táblák, könyvek…)


a
	kert rendbe hozása (faültetés, kertrendezés…)


a
	tanári felszerelése (asztalok, számítógépek,
	nyomtatók…)


az
	elektromos hálózat
	karbantartása (lámpa csere, konnektorok…)

vizesblokkok felújítása
színházterem kialakítása
euritmiaterem kialakítása
zeneterem kialakítása (zongora, egyéb hangszerek)
kézimunka- és asztalos műhely kialakítása

iskolabusz-bérlés


a
	testnevelés terem felszerelése

<p><b>WE ARE AVATAR VIRTUAL
LEARNING</b></p>
<p>We're a group of professors, course
developers and test administrators with over 40 years of combined experience in
higher education.<span>  We know college can be
the incredible experience limited to those few who can afford the high cost of
a higher education.  Right now too many
students can't afford college.  They
either never start, drop out part way or finish college with</span> unmanageable student debt.<span> 
The 1.2 Trillion dollar bill being carried around by former students is a
sign of the importance of the problem. We believe there is a way to make college affordable and lower the
burden on students and taxpayers. We are starting our own non-institutional
approach to getting college credit without college tuition cost.  A new model for higher education that pushes
the burden on learning more on student shoulders and less on the expensive
college institutional approach.</span></p>
<p><b></b><br/></p>
<p><b>COLLEGE LEARNING
REIMAGINED</b></p>
<p>All college education is fundamentally
self-education. The purpose of a college degree program has always been to teach
you how to learn and direct you to resources so you can use it to improve your knowledge
and skills. For this reason most accredited universities fully recognize
passing scores on the
College-Level Examination Program (CLEP) tests as full
credit in their degree programs. To graduate with an undergraduate degree,
you’ll need to accumulate a minimum of 120 credits in 40 or so classes of which
well over half can be tested out of using the CLEP program. This approach allows students with intelligence,
ingenuity, drive, and persistence to complete their undergraduate studies with
little or no financial aid including student loans. Getting a degree from the college of their
choice with less than a year of tuition cost is a very real achievement that that
only takes drive and persistence. We stand committed to helping students whose
goal is a higher education find a affordable path to gaining it.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>WHAT WILL IT BE LIKE TO
BE AN AVATAR STUDENT?</b></p>
<p>Students don’t have to worry about an admissions
process, student affairs offices, course offering schedules, qualifying for financial
aid or other bureaucratic issues until it's time to enroll in their college.
All they need to do to get started is register on the Avatar site and select
the courses they feel comfortable about completing and testing for. Students
can focus on one course at a time, finishing each one in a few weeks or do
several at once taking a few months to complete.<span>  Video lectures, text books and virtual labs
along with real time student discussion is available for students. In addition
the process of course selection and the work they put into them will help the
students find what they are passionate about and what they might be good at. This
allows students to better identify the future career for themselves and the path
to reach it.  Help and support is
available through peer to peer interaction and recommended support links. For a
student studying full-time it’s possible to study for and pass a CLEP examination
with course accreditation every few weeks.</span></p>
<p><span></span><br/></p>
<p><b>WHY DO WE NEED YOUR
HELP?</b></p>
<p>We took some of the first steps to making
Avatar Learning a reality, but we need your support to take the next ones. We’re
now raising funds on Indiegogo to develop the course content and infrastructure
for 33 exams in five subject areas that the College Boards has approved for
CLEP exams.<span>  These course content shells modeled
after traditional college online programs will covering the material taught in
courses that are generally taken in the first few years of college. Indiegogo
is an amazing platform designed to accelerate support for ideas like ours.
After watching our video, we hope you'll share our excitement about making
college more affordable to everyone and possibly reducing the country's 1.2
Trillion dollar student loan debt.  Our initial
one course prototype (although limited) is fully functional at a college level
of instruction.  We’re ready to move on
to the next step of developing all 33 courses. Thanks to your support, our experienced
staff will be ready to start production of course work at the end of the
campaign. We're be all set to deliver college level course work for a small fraction
of the cost of students attending a full college course schedule.</span></p>

<p><b>WHAT WILL THE FUNDS BE
USED FOR?</b></p>

far but additional staff and support is needed. Our goal of $50,000 will enable

</div><p><b>About Anupshahr, Where We
Are!</b></p>
<p>Anupshahr is a tehsil, situated on the banks of the
Ganges, comprising of several villages in the district of Bulandshahr in
Western Uttar Pradesh state in India.</p>
<p>The place is also infamous for widespread poverty,
unemployment and illiteracy. The condition of women and girls is even worse in
the highly patriarchal societal arrangements there.</p>
<p>In the villages where we work, girls and women rank
the lowest in societal hierarchy. Spending on education for girls is considered to be a
waste as parents are highly concerned about marrying her off soon. Due to such mind-sets, daughters are
considered to a burden in the families and are always neglected over sons. Women work continuously in fields and other
household chores and are still the victims of domestic violence and again, seen
as a burden.</p>
<p>Main occupations are farming and labour work – and both earn very less
income. There are fewer opportunities to engage in occupations that led to
economic and social growth of the families. For girls and women especially,
there are almost no other options than assisting their families in farming,
which doesn’t led to any added income.</p>
<p>Most of the families are below poverty line in Anupshahr and many of
them have no access to electricity, basic healthcare facilities, or even access
to toilets for that matter.</p>
<p><b>What we do at Pardada
Pardadi</b></p>
<p><b>Empowering girls and
women through education and employment</b></p>
<p>Pardada Pardadi Educational Society has been
working in Anupshahr since 2000, having initiated several programmes for
economic and social empowerment of girls and women.</p>
<p>Education for girls has been the core of Pardada
Pardadi’s initiatives. We run four Pardada Pardadi Schools in Anupshahr which
provide free education from Kindergarten to class XII, to nearly 1400 girls
from marginalised communities from over 65 villages. The school has pioneered
the ‘Ten rupees a Day’ model wherein students receive a scholarship for each
day’s attendance, to encourage their families. </p>
<p>We also work through Self-Help Groups with over
2000 women from nearly 50 villages providing them skills training and
employment opportunities.</p>
<p>Quality schooling for girls that offers a
complete package of academic education, personality development classes,
exposure through sports, cultural activities, computer training, English
speaking, food and nutrition, health and hygiene – aiming at the holistic
growth of the girls; Transportation to school and back home, for girls coming
from far off villages – bicycles and school buses, depending on the distance; Rs.
10 being credited to every girl’s account starting class VI, for a day’s
attendance at school; Opportunities for girls to engage in meaningful
vocational learning and pursuing dignified employment opportunities later,
thereby bringing their families out of the trap of poverty; Career counselling
of girls and trainings and exposure for their overall personality development; Four
girls from Pardada Pardadi, have also been selected for Community College
Initiative Programme by US Govt. to study in the US for a year; Engaging the
girls in a variety of cultural activities that challenge the regressive social
norms and raise awareness on creating an environment that encourages mental and
physical growth of girls; Healthcare and counselling on adolescent issues which
otherwise is unimaginable for the girls in the community; Mobilising the women
from the community into Self Help Groups that empower them socially as well as
economically, through group savings; Offering vocational trainings to the women
and jobs to sustain their families comfortably; Distribution of solar lanterns
to the families from villages at subsidised rates; getting individual toilets
made in the houses of our regular students and getting community toilets made
in the villages.</p>
<p>Time and again, we have tried to awaken the
community to be sensitive towards the rights of their daughters and women. For
example, through Ganga Arti (prayer of the holy river Ganga (<i>Ganges</i>) by girls, the way male priests
have been doing for centuries – to challenge the male dominance in this field
and to challenge the norm that restricts the women from worshipping during
their menstrual cycle) and Rural Marathon (marathon for girls and women,
encouraging them to come out and claim spaces – girls otherwise are expected to
be homely and not go out of their homes at all - playing and running are unimaginable
for adolescent girls)</p>
<p>In 2012, PPES launched the sports initiative as an
additional means to inculcate leadership skills, confidence, endurance and team
spirit amongst its students.</p>
<p>In 2014, the first Pardada Pardadi Half Marathon
was organised in which 1000+ runners participated. PPES goes beyond education
by implementing a number of community development initiatives spanning gender
empowerment, financial empowerment and health and hygiene.</p>
<p><b>We need your help!</b></p>
<p><b>Half Marathon for promoting
the girl child in rural villages on 23rd August 2015</b></p>
<p>We are holding the event on 23<sup>rd</sup> August
2015, on the theme ‘Aao Saath Chalein’
to promote the ‘Right to Play’ especially among the girls in the villages. The
girls come from the communities where they are treated as inferior humans to
boys. We, through our school and other initiatives, have been trying to break
this and our girls have been setting new standards by participating in a
variety of sports at different levels, competing with the world and becoming
role models for other girls.</p>
<p>Marathon is one such initiative through which we
are trying to promote this cause and encouraging girls from the community to
come out and claim the surroundings. This also goes to encourage the parents to
provide their girls with equal opportunities to learn, grow and explore as much
as they provide for their boys.</p>
<p>In light of the recent campaigns to promote the
right to play in the country, we really feel that more of such initiative
should be organised. In a highly patriarchal society like Anupshahr, such
initiatives matter all the more. This marathon would be our attempt to engage
our girls from Pardada Pardadi as well as from surrounding villages, in play
and other such expressions which enable their physical and mental growth. This
would also go a long way in developing their personalities, enlightening the
parents and encouraging them to give equal opportunities to their girls to grow
and live!</p>
<p><b><i>We solicit your participation in this run for
the girl child!</i></b></p>
<p>Please
help us make this event a success by donating for organising it.</p>
<p>We are organising the event with a
professional marathon event management organization named “<b><i>Run with Me</i></b>” and the
marathon will be held in Anupshahar (Bulandshahr, Uttar Pradesh). The total
population of the village is approx. 2,00,000 from which expected population of
more than 20,000 will be viewing these events.</p>
<p>Total expected runners are going to be
approx. 2000 plus which include girls from our school, local runners, runners from
Bulandshar, Delhi, other non-governmental organisations, participants from
corporates etc.</p>
<p>Through this event, we aim at raising a
minimum of Rs. 20,00,000. The budget for the direct and indirect costs for
organising the event is approximately Rs. 10,00,000 and we aim at raising an
equal amount to support free-of-cost education, health and nutrition and skill
building programmes for the girls from villages of Anupshahr. It would also be
utilised for the women empowerment initiatives of Pardada Pardadi.</p>
<p>So,
we urge you to raise your hands and yourself to come with us for the cause and
initiative we are working on to create a better India for our coming future.</p>
<p><b>Anybody donating for the
cause is registered free for the marathon!</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Let’s run for our girls together!</b></p>
<p>Your
presence and participation in the marathon would be very encouraging for our
girls and women from these villages and also for Pardada Pardadi team.</p>
<p>Details
for the marathon are as follows:</p>
<p></p>

and where girls are given all the opportunity to grow and learn in a dignified
way, thereby leading to girls’ empowerment in rural villages.</p>

economic and social growth of the families. For girls and women especially,
there are almost no other options than assisting their families in farming,
which doesn’t led to any added income.
Most of the families are below poverty line in Anupshahr and many of
them have no access to electricity, basic healthcare facilities, or even access
to toilets for that matter.
What we do at Pardada
Pardadi
Empowering girls and
women through education and employment
Pardada Pardadi Educational Society has been
working in Anupshahr since 2000, having initiated several programmes for
economic and social empowerment of girls and women.
Education for girls has been the core of Pardada
Pardadi’s initiatives. We run four Pardada Pardadi Schools in Anupshahr which
provide free education from Kindergarten to class XII, to nearly 1400 girls
from marginalised communities from over 65 villages. The school has pioneered
the ‘Ten rupees a Day’ model wherein students receive a scholarship for each
day’s attendance, to encourage their families. 
We also work through Self-Help Groups with over
2000 women from nearly 50 villages providing them skills training and
employment opportunities.
Quality schooling for girls that offers a
complete package of academic education, personality development classes,
exposure through sports, cultural activities, computer training, English
speaking, food and nutrition, health and hygiene – aiming at the holistic
growth of the girls; Transportation to school and back home, for girls coming
from far off villages – bicycles and school buses, depending on the distance; Rs.
10 being credited to every girl’s account starting class VI, for a day’s
attendance at school; Opportunities for girls to engage in meaningful
vocational learning and pursuing dignified employment opportunities later,
thereby bringing their families out of the trap of poverty; Career counselling
of girls and trainings and exposure for their overall personality development; Four
girls from Pardada Pardadi, have also been selected for Community College
Initiative Programme by US Govt. to study in the US for a year; Engaging the
girls in a variety of cultural activities that challenge the regressive social
norms and raise awareness on creating an environment that encourages mental and
physical growth of girls; Healthcare and counselling on adolescent issues which
otherwise is unimaginable for the girls in the community; Mobilising the women
from the community into Self Help Groups that empower them socially as well as
economically, through group savings; Offering vocational trainings to the women
and jobs to sustain their families comfortably; Distribution of solar lanterns
to the families from villages at subsidised rates; getting individual toilets
made in the houses of our regular students and getting community toilets made
in the villages.
Time and again, we have tried to awaken the
community to be sensitive towards the rights of their daughters and women. For
example, through Ganga Arti (prayer of the holy river Ganga (Ganges) by girls, the way male priests
have been doing for centuries – to challenge the male dominance in this field
and to challenge the norm that restricts the women from worshipping during
their menstrual cycle) and Rural Marathon (marathon for girls and women,
encouraging them to come out and claim spaces – girls otherwise are expected to
be homely and not go out of their homes at all - playing and running are unimaginable
for adolescent girls)
In 2012, PPES launched the sports initiative as an
additional means to inculcate leadership skills, confidence, endurance and team
spirit amongst its students.
In 2014, the first Pardada Pardadi Half Marathon
was organised in which 1000+ runners participated. PPES goes beyond education
by implementing a number of community development initiatives spanning gender
empowerment, financial empowerment and health and hygiene.
We need your help!
Half Marathon for promoting
the girl child in rural villages on 23rd August 2015
We are holding the event on 23rd August
2015, on the theme ‘Aao Saath Chalein’
to promote the ‘Right to Play’ especially among the girls in the villages. The
girls come from the communities where they are treated as inferior humans to
boys. We, through our school and other initiatives, have been trying to break
this and our girls have been setting new standards by participating in a
variety of sports at different levels, competing with the world and becoming
role models for other girls.
Marathon is one such initiative through which we
are trying to promote this cause and encouraging girls from the community to
come out and claim the surroundings. This also goes to encourage the parents to
provide their girls with equal opportunities to learn, grow and explore as much
as they provide for their boys.
In light of the recent campaigns to promote the
right to play in the country, we really feel that more of such initiative
should be organised. In a highly patriarchal society like Anupshahr, such
initiatives matter all the more. This marathon would be our attempt to engage
our girls from Pardada Pardadi as well as from surrounding villages, in play
and other such expressions which enable their physical and mental growth. This
would also go a long way in developing their personalities, enlightening the
parents and encouraging them to give equal opportunities to their girls to grow
and live!
We solicit your participation in this run for
the girl child!
Please
help us make this event a success by donating for organising it.
We are organising the event with a
professional marathon event management organization named “Run with Me” and the
marathon will be held in Anupshahar (Bulandshahr, Uttar Pradesh). The total
population of the village is approx. 2,00,000 from which expected population of
more than 20,000 will be viewing these events.
Total expected runners are going to be
approx. 2000 plus which include girls from our school, local runners, runners from
Bulandshar, Delhi, other non-governmental organisations, participants from
corporates etc.
Through this event, we aim at raising a
minimum of Rs. 20,00,000. The budget for the direct and indirect costs for
organising the event is approximately Rs. 10,00,000 and we aim at raising an
equal amount to support free-of-cost education, health and nutrition and skill
building programmes for the girls from villages of Anupshahr. It would also be
utilised for the women empowerment initiatives of Pardada Pardadi.
So,
we urge you to raise your hands and yourself to come with us for the cause and
initiative we are working on to create a better India for our coming future.
Anybody donating for the
cause is registered free for the marathon!

Let’s run for our girls together!
Your
presence and participation in the marathon would be very encouraging for our
girls and women from these villages and also for Pardada Pardadi team.
Details
for the marathon are as follows:

Minimum Age Eligibility:
ü  Half
Marathon – 18 years as on 23rd August 2015
ü  5
Kms and 10 Kms – 18 years as on 23rd August 2015
Remember,
you donation would go a long way in creating a society that cherishes its girls
and where girls are given all the opportunity to grow and learn in a dignified
way, thereby leading to girls’ empowerment in rural villages.

Donate
for the cause!

<p><b>WHAT IN THE WORLD AM I DOING?</b></p>
<p>It's not just me...WE'RE BUILDING A SCHOOL IN KENYA! What a THRILL. For those of you who don't know me, my name is Kamari and I just got back from one of the craziest experiences of my life. I went to Kenya on a relief/missions trip and got my heart handed to me when I visited the <a href=""http://www.preciouskids.center/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Precious Kids Center</a> in Kitale. Small but mighty, The Precious Kids Center serves children with disabilities to provide the support they need to learn, grow, and reach their full potential. Many of the children live on the current property. The founder and director of the center is <a href=""http://www.preciouskids.center/about/sammy/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sammy Hammork</a>, a 20 something rock star from Orange County,CA who MOVED to Kitale and now takes care of the kids on every level possible. From their health, education, and emotional support Sammy literally does it all... frequently will little help. This last week through generous donors, God has provided the funds to finish a new home for the children currently living at Precious Kids Center! There are currently 38 kids and four house mothers packed into a little house on less than a quarter of an acre. It’s crowded and, though the kids don’t seem to mind, they have all been patiently working towards the goal of moving the new property where there will be more space to learn play and grow. I personally spent a couple of days at the current property and fell in love with the children. There are many difficulties but I have so much hope in their future and this center will provide more than an education but a home. My goal is to get the new school built asap and get the kids learning and thriving on their new campus! </p>
<p>
</p><p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>There will be a few surprises for donors as we get closer and closer to our goal. So, other than giving out of the kindness of your heart there's that to look forward to. WHO DOESNT LIKE SURPRISES!?</p>

<p><b>School Vision:</b></p>
<p><i>Our vision for all Rosewood students is that they acquire a far different set of knowledge, skills and perspectives than previous generations.  They will be prepared to share with, work alongside and communicate with persons from different backgrounds.  We will begin the teaching necessary for our students to be better prepared to understand and confront complex global issues as they continue on their academic journey.</i></p>
<p><b>Our Story:</b></p>
<p>My name is Linda Crowder and I am the proud principal at Rosewood Elementary, School for Advanced Studies (SAS), home of the HUSKIES!  This is my 7<sup>th</sup> year as the principal at Rosewood.  During my tenure we became a SAS in 2011, with a focus on Project Based Learning which is strongly tied to the CCSS and 21<sup>st</sup> Century Skills. Rosewood is a Transitional Kindergarten (TK) through 6<sup>th</sup> grade campus located in a densely populated area of Los Angeles and West Hollywood. We were one of 37 schools within the LAUSD and only 1 of 4 schools in Local District 4 to pilot the TK program in 2010, so we have the evidence to support the importance of early education and differentiation.  Approximately 325 students attend Rosewood: there is 1 TK, 2 first grades, 2 second grades, 2 third grades, 2 forth grades, 1 fifth grade, 1 sixth grade and 2 Autism Core special day classes.  I have 15 classroom teachers and one resource specialist.  I have no out of classroom personnel.</p>
<p>Though our neighborhood student enrollment is increasing, most of our students attend under either work permit (parent works in the neighborhood), open enrollment (we are school of choice), or inter district permit (student resides in a different school district).  Many of our parents work at Cedars-Sinai Hospital, The Beverly Center, local hotels, other various businesses in the neighborhood and some work as nannies. Students come to us from Palmdale, the San Fernando Valley, Inglewood, South Gate, and many other areas throughout LA County and because of this we are a very diverse school.</p>
<p>Demographics:  40% Latino</p>
<p>  26% African American</p>
<p>  26% White</p>
<p>  3.9% Korean </p>
<p>  2.7% Filipino</p>
<p>  .9% Chinese</p>
<p>  .9% Japanese</p>
<p>  .3% Laotian</p>
<p>  .3% American Indian</p>
<p>  .6% Indian</p>
<p>  1.3% Other</p>
<p>Rosewood Elementary is a school wide Title I school.  “Title I is part of the Elementary and Secondary Education act of 1965, and is the foundation of the federal commitment to closing the achievement gap between low-income and other students.  The 1994 reauthorization of Title I shifted the program’s emphasis from remedial education to helping all disadvantaged children reach rigorous state academic standards expected of all children”. Approximately 54% of our students are eligible for free or reduced lunch.  We provide all students with free breakfast through a program called Breakfast in the Classroom.  Students staying in an after school program receive a free meal through a program called Supper at School.  I have students in homeless situations, parents that are or were incarcerated, and families struggling to put food on the table.  I take students regularly to Operation School Bell, an organization that provides new school clothes to students from impoverished circumstances. By working with these children, we improve school attendance, promote learning and enhance self-esteem.</p>
<p>As a School for Advanced Studies, we begin early identification of gifted youth, beginning in Transitional Kindergarten. We received “Exemplary” status based on the school-site GATE data and comprehensive school wide Gifted and Talented Education (GATE) program narrative.  We also exceeded the District’s 6% identification goal for African American, Latino, or school wide population.  </p>
<p>Though we are a School for Advanced Studies we believe in educating the whole child.  Though we live in a global society that requires students to think critically and creatively and solve complex problems; we must first ensure that the basic needs of our students are met so that they can be active participants in their learning.  We follow <b>Maslow's hierarchy of needs,</b> a theory of human <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_psychology"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>developmental psychology</u></a> in which basic needs must be met before one can grow.  Maslow used the terms ""physiological"" (food, water, etc.), ""safety"" (feeling safe), ""emotional"" (feelings of belonging and love) and ""esteem"" (feeling good about oneself), and ""self-actualization"" (reaching full potential). I have students who worry about their next meal, having a place to sleep, and abuse or neglect in the home.  For these students in particular engaging in an academic setting is not their priority.  As a school we have many services to help at risk youth as well as all youth – we offer after school tutoring during our first semester and Saturday School during our second semester.  The National Council of Jewish Women provides a homework club twice a week for students in need,  Koreah  L.A. sends volunteer readers to read to and with students needing additional supports as well as self- esteem boosts, Cedars-Sinai Hospital provides an art therapy program, at the school site, to students that have suffered some type of trauma, and students take part in The Morning Mile, a running club that takes place before the start of the school day to get them motivated for the day and as a means to address the issue of childhood obesity . </p>
<p><b>Why are we running this campaign?</b></p>
<p>We are running a campaign to raise $ 278,634.  This funding is for a <b>Technology Media Lab</b>.</p>
<p><i>“In the 21<sup>st</sup> century, students must be fully engaged.  This requires the use of technology tools and resources, involvement with interesting and relevant projects, and learning environments – including online environments – that are supportive and safe.</i></p>
<p><i>…In the 21<sup>st</sup> century educators must be given and be prepared to use technology tools; they must be collaborators in learning – constantly seeking knowledge and acquiring new skills along with their students.”</i></p>
<ul><li>
<p>Arne Duncan, U.S. Secretary of Education</p>
<p>We currently have a computer lab with the old iMAC 3g’s, those colorful plastic bubble type computers.  It is a working lab and allows students the opportunity to word process, research, use some educational software, and to take their Accelerated Reader (AR) online tests.  With Common Core State Standards and the charge to ensure that all students are college and career ready in literacy no later than 12<sup>th</sup> grade, we must be able to provide all of our students and teachers with the tools to be successful.</p>
<p>Rosewood students are at a disadvantage in that the state tests administered to students in grades 3 – 12 are no longer pencil paper tests, but done on a device.  The test is called the SBAC – Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium.  Students that do not have access to the necessary technology may not do as well and when the scores begin to count, these students will not have the same academic opportunities.  One example of this is when students in grades 2 – 12 took the California Standards Test (CST); those scores were part of the documentation for eligibility in the Gifted and Talented Education program.  We are going into year three of this test.  During the rollout two years ago, Rosewood Elementary was given 35 iPads with keyboards for students to use during testing and the iPads were removed from the school after testing.  During this last school year we were given 70 iPads with keyboards for students to use for testing and I am grateful that they were not taken at the end of the school year.  My students will be able to begin the 2015-2016 school year with this working technology.</p>
<p>With this information you may be wondering “Why a Technology Media Lab and not just give every child a device”?  Placing an iPad in a child’s hand without either the child or teacher knowing what to do with the device is not a good use of resources.  We are viewing this campaign as the first of two fundraising campaigns.  This campaign will fund a Technology Media Lab and the second campaign will be to place a device in every student’s hand.  </p>
<p>During this campaign our goal is to have a Technology Media Lab with a fully credentialed technology teacher, a lab with both pc’s and mac’s so our students know how to use different computers, students will learn typing and basic and advanced computer skills, students will learn to make and edit movies, create websites or pod-casts, learn to code, art design, and be able to learn these things through active learning.  Teachers and Teaching Assistants will be provided necessary professional development to ensure they know how to use the technology and how to integrate that technology into the classroom.  The Technology Media Lab will ensure the 21<sup>st</sup> Century Skills of communication, collaboration, creativity and innovation along with providing students with the much needed media and technology skills are being met. </p>
<p>The Technology Media Lab teacher will also assist teachers with integrating the use of technology into the curriculum as well as the appropriate in class use of the iPads.  This year we will have 5 Smartboards in 5 classrooms, the Technology Media Lab teacher will also work with these teachers to ensure they are effectively using the Smartboards in the classrooms.</p>
<p>The Technology Media Lab teacher will:</p>
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>teach students in grades TK – 6 how to use the     technology in the Technology Lab</li>
<li>stress the importance of the safe use of technology at     school, at home, and in the community </li>

</div>","School Vision:
Our vision for all Rosewood students is that they acquire a far different set of knowledge, skills and perspectives than previous generations.  They will be prepared to share with, work alongside and communicate with persons from different backgrounds.  We will begin the teaching necessary for our students to be better prepared to understand and confront complex global issues as they continue on their academic journey.
Our Story:
My name is Linda Crowder and I am the proud principal at Rosewood Elementary, School for Advanced Studies (SAS), home of the HUSKIES!  This is my 7th year as the principal at Rosewood.  During my tenure we became a SAS in 2011, with a focus on Project Based Learning which is strongly tied to the CCSS and 21st Century Skills. Rosewood is a Transitional Kindergarten (TK) through 6th grade campus located in a densely populated area of Los Angeles and West Hollywood. We were one of 37 schools within the LAUSD and only 1 of 4 schools in Local District 4 to pilot the TK program in 2010, so we have the evidence to support the importance of early education and differentiation.  Approximately 325 students attend Rosewood: there is 1 TK, 2 first grades, 2 second grades, 2 third grades, 2 forth grades, 1 fifth grade, 1 sixth grade and 2 Autism Core special day classes.  I have 15 classroom teachers and one resource specialist.  I have no out of classroom personnel.
Though our neighborhood student enrollment is increasing, most of our students attend under either work permit (parent works in the neighborhood), open enrollment (we are school of choice), or inter district permit (student resides in a different school district).  Many of our parents work at Cedars-Sinai Hospital, The Beverly Center, local hotels, other various businesses in the neighborhood and some work as nannies. Students come to us from Palmdale, the San Fernando Valley, Inglewood, South Gate, and many other areas throughout LA County and because of this we are a very diverse school.
Demographics:  40% Latino
  26% African American

Rosewood Elementary is a school wide Title I school.  “Title I is part of the Elementary and Secondary Education act of 1965, and is the foundation of the federal commitment to closing the achievement gap between low-income and other students.  The 1994 reauthorization of Title I shifted the program’s emphasis from remedial education to helping all disadvantaged children reach rigorous state academic standards expected of all children”.

Why are we running this campaign?
We are running a campaign to raise $ 278,634.  This funding is for a Technology Media Lab.
“In the 21st century, students must be fully engaged.  This requires the use of technology tools and resources, involvement with interesting and relevant projects, and learning environments – including online environments – that are supportive and safe.
…In the 21st century educators must be given and be prepared to use technology tools; they must be collaborators in learning – constantly seeking knowledge and acquiring new skills along with their students.”

Arne Duncan, U.S. Secretary of Education
We currently have a computer lab with the old iMAC 3g’s, those colorful plastic bubble type computers.  It is a working lab and allows students the opportunity to word process, research, use some educational software, and to take their Accelerated Reader (AR) online tests.  With Common Core State Standards and the charge to ensure that all students are college and career ready in literacy no later than 12th grade, we must be able to provide all of our students and teachers with the tools to be successful.
Rosewood students are at a disadvantage in that the state tests administered to students in grades 3 – 12 are no longer pencil paper tests, but done on a device.  The test is called the SBAC – Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium.  Students that do not have access to the necessary technology may not do as well and when the scores begin to count, these students will not have the same academic opportunities.  One example of this is when students in grades 2 – 12 took the California Standards Test (CST); those scores were part of the documentation for eligibility in the Gifted and Talented Education program.  We are going into year three of this test.  During the rollout two years ago, Rosewood Elementary was given 35 iPads with keyboards for students to use during testing and the iPads were removed from the school after testing.  During this last school year we were given 70 iPads with keyboards for students to use for testing and I am grateful that they were not taken at the end of the school year.  My students will be able to begin the 2015-2016 school year with this working technology.

<div>Mi nombre es Gabriel Silva. Soy un abogado panameño con un gran interés en mejorar la calidad de educación de mi país. Fui profesor en la Universidad Católica Santa María la Antigua, he dictado seminarios en colegios públicos y privados a lo largo de Panamá y he fundado y trabajado en varias organizaciones no gubernamentales (ONG) que buscan mejorar la educación en Panamá.  </div> <p>Yo también, como muchos de ustedes, reconozco que uno de los retos más grande para Panamá es la calidad de educación. El desarrollo que está viviendo el país no será sostenible si no le damos las herramientas apropiadas a las actuales y futuras generaciones. </p>
<p>Por eso, junto con otros jóvenes, hemos empezado una ONG llamada Enseña por Panamá que tiene como objetivo incrementar los niveles de educación en Panamá al posesionar a jóvenes líderes profesionales como docentes en colegios en áreas principalmente marginales a lo largo y ancho del país. </p> </div> <div> <h3>¿Qué es Enseña por Panamá?</h3> <p>Enseña por Panamá es una ONG panameña que forma parte de la reconocida red internacional de ONGs llamada Teach for All. En términos sencillos, estamos abriendo en Panamá una ""franquicia"" de Teach for All. Teach for All tiene operaciones exitosas en más de 35 países. </p>
<p>En concreto, Enseña por Panamá reclutará, entrenará y posesionará a jóvenes profesionales graduados de universidades en colegios públicos del país. Estos talentosos profesionales dictarán las clases como docentes en las áreas que son expertos, desde química hasta inglés. Sin embargo, nuestros profesionales han pasado por un riguroso proceso de selección en donde fueron elegidos los más competentes, líderes, inteligentes,dinámicos, y los que tienen mayor potencial para ser agentes de cambio en las comunidades de los colegios que atiendan. </p>

</div></div>","¿Quién soy?
Mi nombre es Gabriel Silva. Soy un abogado panameño con un gran interés en mejorar la calidad de educación de mi país. Fui profesor en la Universidad Católica Santa María la Antigua, he dictado seminarios en colegios públicos y privados a lo largo de Panamá y he fundado y trabajado en varias organizaciones no gubernamentales (ONG) que buscan mejorar la educación en Panamá.   Yo también, como muchos de ustedes, reconozco que uno de los retos más grande para Panamá es la calidad de educación. El desarrollo que está viviendo el país no será sostenible si no le damos las herramientas apropiadas a las actuales y futuras generaciones. 
Por eso, junto con otros jóvenes, hemos empezado una ONG llamada Enseña por Panamá que tiene como objetivo incrementar los niveles de educación en Panamá al posesionar a jóvenes líderes profesionales como docentes en colegios en áreas principalmente marginales a lo largo y ancho del país.    ¿Qué es Enseña por Panamá? Enseña por Panamá es una ONG panameña que forma parte de la reconocida red internacional de ONGs llamada Teach for All. En términos sencillos, estamos abriendo en Panamá una ""franquicia"" de Teach for All. Teach for All tiene operaciones exitosas en más de 35 países. 
En concreto, Enseña por Panamá reclutará, entrenará y posesionará a jóvenes profesionales graduados de universidades en colegios públicos del país. Estos talentosos profesionales dictarán las clases como docentes en las áreas que son expertos, desde química hasta inglés. Sin embargo, nuestros profesionales han pasado por un riguroso proceso de selección en donde fueron elegidos los más competentes, líderes, inteligentes,dinámicos, y los que tienen mayor potencial para ser agentes de cambio en las comunidades de los colegios que atiendan. 
¿Cuál es la Situación Actual?Al día de hoy Enseña por Panamá ya cuenta con un equipo de trabajo tiempo completo, un convenio de cooperación con el Ministerio de Educación de Panamá, un convenio de cooperación con Teach for All, el patrocinio de algunas personas y empresas y muchas ganas de trabajar y mejorar la educación en Panamá.  Sin embargo, es importante que el proyecto se de a conocer y recaude fondos adicionales para poder empezar a posesionar a los profesionales en colegios en el próximo ciclo escolar del 2016. 
Por ello, el 6 de agosto de 2015 empiezo  un viaje en bicicleta a lo largo del país, por 30 días, en donde visitaré los colegios más remotos de nuestro país para dar a conocer el proyecto y entender a mayor plenitud la realidad educativa de Panamá que sólo conocemos por estudios.

Its epicenter was located in the Dolakha district destroying hundreds of thousands of homes, injuring thousands and killing hundreds. </p>
<p>For a week I (Kathrine Norsk) visited the district, lived in their temporary homes and met up with the principals of two schools that collapsed during the earthquake. The school management boards each made an estimate cost of building a new school. They are all ready to do the work so their kids can study in a safe environment. All they need is your help to get the materials. </p>
<p>The greatest thing about this project is that the money goes directly to the source. This is our personal contribution to helping Nepal. There is no administration fee. No profit. All the donations will go towards buying the needed materials and it is managed by the Co-Founder of the project, Suman Nepal, who is currently living in Denmark and working for Unicef. He is visiting his home country in October to ensure the completion of the project. </p>
<p>Your contribution to this project ensures that the children in a minimum of two schools can study in a safe environment once agin. Education is the way out of poverty and you will be able to ensure the future of these children. The schools are in an area where other donations are scarce due to the location. However these children deserve an education just as much as everybody else and you can be a part of making the difference! </p>

<h3>How it all started:</h3>
<p>After a semester abroad at SCAD Hong Kong, I planned a two month journey around Asia, to explore the continent I had never seen. The last stop was Nepal, where I was suppose to hike the Annapurna circuit. Since it was the last stop, I booked my ticket back to Denmark months prior to the trip. </p>
<p>On April 25th the first Earthquake happened in Nepal, and though I have never been there, I have close friends from Nepal and I have exhibited at the Kathmandu National Museum. As a self-paying student, money does not grow on the trees, and the donation I was able to make had minimal impact. Instead I thought of changing my purpose in Nepal and use my photographic skills to help fundraising in the way I know best - through images and storytelling.</p>
<p>I contacted my friend Suman Nepal, who I met through Unicef back in Denmark 2014. I expressed my intentions, got him on board, and before I knew it I had a place to stay and a project to research.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What we did:</h3>
<p>On May 12 2015 the second earthquake occurred with a 7.3 magnitude. Its epicenter was located in the Dolakha district destroying hundreds of thousands of homes, injuring thousands and killing hundreds. </p>
<p>From the 22nd-28th of July, I visited the Dolakha district in Nepal. This area takes around seven hours to reach by bus from Kathmandu (the capital), however after the earthquake and with the current monsoon rain, many landslides and floods are making it difficult to reach the district and the aid distributed has been limited. Despite the obstacles, we managed to get there and back to complete the research.</p>
<p>After hours of driving and walking, I witnessed the hundreds of thousands of collapsed homes. It was almost three months after the earthquakes, yet the damages were vivid. New temporary homes had been built out of the rooftops and utilities had been rescued from the destroyed homes. </p>

<p>During my stay in Dolakha I  was accompanied by Yadav Ghimlrey, one of Suman Nepal's friends. Yadav grew up in Dolakha and he was my research partner and translator during my stay in Dolakha. We spent the next days visiting schools which had been destroyed by the earthquakes. The children were now being taught in something called TLC's - Temporary Learning Centers, which locals had built with their own time and money so the kids could continue learning. </p>
<p>One day we hiked an hour up a mountain to Kutidada Primary school. On the way to the school we came across another school. After being surrounded by collapsed buildings I was surprised to see that this particular school was still standing. Due to a more robust foundation, the school had survived the earthquake. This is the type of structure that we wish to construct for the other schools if we get enough funding.</p>

<p> We came unannounced but the enthusiasm from the principal was felt immediately. He made a few phone calls and before I knew it nearly twenty men and women, the school management board, had reached the top, ready to hear about the possibilities of improving the educational environment for the children. It was warming to see the enthusiasm of the community. They were ready to help get Nepal and the school back on its feet, all they needed was a little help - This is where all of you now have the chance.  <br/></p>

<p>We met up with a few other schools, but the same enthusiasm wasn't felt, so we kept searching for people who needed and wanted our help. In the end of the week we met up with another principal in Charikot, the biggest city in the Dolakha district. Once again we were met with eager and a principal who wanted the best for his children. He handed me over a plan of what he would like to do for the school. As we told him that we could not confirm any amount (because it all depends on you), he replied: ""Any help is greatly appreciated"". We again sat down to discuss the financials, to have an overview of the cost of rebuilding the school. This school has children from grade one through high school, and like Kutidada it was in great need.</p>
