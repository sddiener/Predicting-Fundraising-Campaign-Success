<p>Love Bikes is a small bicycle build and repair shop in Pittsburgh, PA. In April of 2012 I celebrated one full year in business (we made it through winter!!) This year's bicycle season has been great and the people in the neighborhood have been super supportive and excited about having a repair shop close by where previously there were none. And for that I am entirely grateful.</p>
<p>Now I'd like to start something new and different and fun. With your help I'd like to begin producing hand-built bamboo bicycle frames and complete bikes. I'd like people to be able to walk into the shop and see and touch a bamboo bike - take one out for a ride and see just how comfortable, strong, and reliable they are. In the summer of 2011 I learned how to build bamboo bike frames at a small shop in Brooklyn not unlike my own. While there I not only learned about the process and the tools and materials but also about the advantages of riding a bamboo bike and the positive effect producing them can have on a neighborhood.</p>
<p>Bamboo bicycles are essentially, functional Art. Not only are they beautiful, they represent ingenuity and can inspire creativity. They promote environmental and cultural awerness. They give their riders and the poeple that build them a real sense of pride that what they're riding and what they're making is unique and ecological. And best of all, bamboo really makes a great bike. It's light, it's stronger than steel, it's comfortable, and it's budget-friendly.</p>
<p>Eventually I'd like all the bamboo used in our bicycles to be grown and harvested right here in Pittsburgh. I'd like to offer free seminars a few times a year to people that want to learn about bamboo bikes and how they're made.  I'd even like to offer one on one studio time for those who'd like to build their own bike right here in the shop. All this starts here by raising the money for the tools, jigs, and materials to start producing our first line of bikes. Our goal amount will be just enough to get us going. Any money beyond that will be used  to buy more material and will get us started off with that much more of a bang!</p>
<p>There are 4 Love Bikes tshirts available at the $100 donation level that also includes a 25% off of labor coupon at the shop. After the shirts run out the $100 dollar level perk will be a Love Bikes sticker, pin and 30% off of labor at the shop.</p>
<p>The $50 level of donation includes a Love Bikes sticker and 10% off of labor at the shop.</p>
<p>The $25 level of donation includes a Love Bikes sticker and pin.</p>
<p>Your generous donation will not only help a small business but will also benefit the environment and people of the developing community in which we're based.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

Our idea
The idea originated in the restaurant industry of Mr Ravinder Issar's Kohinoor restaurant in Esslingen, Germany.
There is hardly an Indian restaurant that does not serve Indian tea and the guests love it.
Who does not love the smell of hot, freshly brewed Indian Chai?
Behind the scenes however, the restaurateurs deal with several problems. Before the restaurant opens, restaurateurs prepare about 3 liters of tea and store it in a thermos flask, so guests get their tea served as soon as possible.
It is nearly impossible to offer fresh Indian tea to guests during operating hours, because of the stress in the kitchen the hot milk might overflow should just a second of distraction occur. And if the milk does overflow a cook might spend a lot of time cleaning up a big mess.
Our new innovation called ""ENCHAIMENT"" solves this problem and it enables the host to offer his guests freshly made tea without reluctance.
Economically ENCHAIMENT will offer a vast advantage for restaurateurs, as they will save about 1 Euro a day of extra tea they would otherwise through away with the thermos method.

<h2><strong><em>What and Why..</em></strong></h2>
<p><strong>My project is intended to save lives and millions of dollars in property damage that are caused by residential gas and propane explosions.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>For me, this project is a personal goal of thirty years.  On a cool September morning in 1982, our house exploded due to a propane leak, killing both of my parents.  Thirty years later, I now have a chance to prevent this tragedy from occuring to others.  </strong><strong>I want to save lives, and I can do so with your help.  I am a disabled engineer who has designed a safety valve system which could prevent tragedies like the one that killed my parents.  In addition to having the technical skill, I believe that due to my history, I may be able to serve as a type of rallying point, the type required to change an entire industry.</strong></p>
<p><img alt=""The newspaper story covering the explosion that killed my parents and destroyed everything we owned. These tragedies continue to happen. With your help, it may be possible to prevent these horrific events in the future."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-d9m0vM4H9bA/US-YV_X9uwI/AAAAAAAABFQ/AM_pJxTRFvA/s902/sept11.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 770px; height: 258px;"" title=""This is for you, Mom and Dad.""/></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>With your help, I now have the ability to make a difference for others.  Recent changes in manufacturing and pricing have made key elements in making a safety valve which could prevent these tragedies a reasonable and attainable goal.</p>
<p>Over the past year I have experimented with various versions of a sensor-controlled safety valve, and achieved success with a prototype costing under $100 at ""model"" scale, as demonstrated in the video for the project.  Though functional, I have built this prototype using parts not designed for the purposes I am using them for, factory surplus parts purchased from ebay, and uncalibrated sensors.  The next step is to obtain the proper tools and parts, and build a proper, presentable prototype.</p>
<p>My goal is to scale this project up to incorporate proper equipment, and then to bring the valve system to a major manufacturer.  Due to the immense number of certifications required, it simply is impossible for a small company or individual to produce the actual valve.  Ideally, I would like to pass the design on to a Trane or Honeywell or the like, companies that can actually implement these safety features as standard gas equipment in the future.</p>
<p>This is not about money.  It's about knowing that I can help prevent others from the horrible events I have lived.  I can do it, with your help.</p>
<p>The challenges are twofold.  I became disabled by something called Crohns Disease and other medical issues a number of years back.  My work ""schedule"" is sporadic and not at all amenable to most companies.  I may start work at three in the morning and continue for sixteen hours.. or I may be sick on any given day, at any time.  This inability to conform to any type of schedule due to my illness is a constant challenge.  A key portion of the funding is to be channeled into converting a basement corner into a reasonable technical workspace so that I can continue to work at the pace I am able to manage given my condition.</p>
<p>To bring this project to it's proper end- mass production and establishing this type of safety system as a standard for utilities- will take more than a few thousand dollars.  It will take the help and cooperation of at least one major corporation capable of handling the intricacies, and it will also require wide public support.  As potential supporters review this, please also consider if there may be support that can be given that isn't monetary.  I will need the assistance of a large manufacturer and utility companies, ideally also the legal and political assistance that will be required to handle regulatory hurdles.</p>
<p>The technology is now within reach.  I can make a difference.  It may just be what I am on this planet to do. </p>
<p>I have the technical skills and the time.  What I need now is the finances to assemble a proper full scale prototype, and also the assistance and cooperation of people in the industry.  It is my hope that public support of this safety device will be the catalyst needed to engage the required resources to mass produce the final product.  If you can't contribute, tell people you know about it.  Tell them to tell their friends.  Maybe, if we can get enough people to ask ""Why isn't in my home already?"", I can make it happen for all of us. </p>
<p>Thank you for your time and interest in my project.  Please help me make a difference.  The home, the life saved could be your own.  Allow me to turn the deaths of my parents into something meaningful.  Let's make it so that nobody else has to know the horror that still haunts me three decades later.</p>

<h3>The Basics</h3>
<p>We love rugs, and we're not afraid to say it.</p>
<p>Back in 2010, we picked up this crazy hobby of turning scrap from a well-known Pacific Northwest woolen mill into thick, fuzzy rugs. Our feet loved them. Our pets loved them. We started making them as gifts for family &amp; friends. We donated beds and toys to shelters at the holidays. We started an Etsy shop and looked for local craft fairs. We offered rugs up for school auctions and animal charity fundraisers.</p>
<p>Three years later, we've got a steady business, some fantastic and enthusiastic supporters, two wholesale clients, and the drive to keep expanding.</p>
<p><img alt=""Aimee and a friend"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/535720_309139049165910_293221229_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: baseline;"" title=""Our First OHS Doggie Dash (2012)""/> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need From You...</h3>
<h3>And What You Get From Us!</h3>
<p>We have our eyes on some big shows in 2013 and 2014, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Portland Pet Expo (October 2013) and the Seattle Pet Expo (April 2014)</li>
<li>the Portland Mini-Maker Faire and the New York World Maker Faire (both September 2013)</li>
<li>the Seattle Gift Show (August 2013) and the Portland Gift &amp; Accessories Show (March 2014)</li>
<li>the NW Pet and Companion Animal Expo (April 2014 - our 2nd year)</li>
<li>the Oregon Humane Society Doggie Dash (May 2014 - our 3rd year)</li>
<li>and other events in the Portland, OR area</li>
</ul>
<p>There are plenty of rugs just waiting for good homes... and mountains of materials for making even more fuzzy, loveable, huggable RugEmpire rugs. It's the entry fees and travel costs for these shows that makes them just a little bit (or in some cases, a LOT) out of our reach.</p>
<p>So that's what we're asking for: help with the entry fees. No, the $3100 we're asking for doesn't cover them entirely. But it covers a big chunk of them, plus some extra for marketing (advertising and promo items).</p>
<p>What's in it for you? Besides, of course, our everlasting gratitude?</p>
<p>All the rug-related memoribilia you could ever dream of. Bumper stickers, personalized pendants, and yes... RUGS. Want to learn how to make rugs the way we do? That's on offer, too.</p>
<p><img alt=""RugLove bumper stickers"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-frc3/2502_448954988517648_516672481_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: baseline;"" title=""RugLove bumper stickers""/></p>
</div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help Us Grow</h3>
<p>Your encouragement and love means a lot to us! This really isn't <em>just</em> about the money. It's about our tribe believing in us, and in RugEmpire. It's about the energy and excitement you share with us.</p>
<p> </p>
<ol>
<li>
<em><strong>Visit us at craft shows and expos</strong></em>. Lots of the shows we choose have free admission, so you can come and browse. It's awfully nice to see a friendly, familiar face.</li>
<li>
<em><strong>Help spread the word about RugEmpire</strong></em>. Share our pics/links on the social networking site of your choice. We have a Facebook page, a website, and an Etsy shop any time you feel inclined to share.</li>
<li>
<em><strong>Show off YOUR RugLove</strong></em>! If you have a RugEmpire rug, let us see some pics of you and your family enjoying the ruglove! Our Facebook page has a photo album for pictures of pets and their rugs.</li>
<li>Gimme that gogo factor -- <em><strong>share our indiegogo fundraiser on the social networking site of your choice</strong></em>. The bigger social reach we have, the better chance we have of being featured by indiegogo itself. More exposure = more gooder for our fundraiser.</li>
<li>
<em><strong>Host a rug-a-thon or a toymaking session.</strong></em> It's always fun to take the crafty goodness on the road! You don't have to work, just keep us company.</li>
<li>
<em><strong>Give the gift of display items</strong></em>: old folding tables, TV trays, storage tubs, tablecloths, and other stuff we could use for display at craft fairs. If you don't need them, that is. Our products are recycled, and most of our display is recycled, too (only the canopy is new).</li>
<li>
<em><strong>Give the gift of supplies</strong></em>. Our rugs are made of scrap materials from a Pacific Northwest woolen mill... we'd be happy to have you take us scrap shopping.</li>
<li>
<em><strong>Give the gift of rugs</strong></em>. Shop via Etsy, catch up with us at a craft fair, or if you're in the Portland, OR area you can have a private rug showing.</li>
</ol><h3> </h3>
<h3>The Potential Impact of All This</h3>
<p>RugEmpire has been slowly and consistiently growing over the last three years. We sold one lonely rug in 2010... so okay, that wasn't a hard goal to beat. Since then, we've learned a lot about the value of our product and our time, and about finding the right audience. Our little Etsy shop is chugging along. We've got three wholesale clients (two on the West Coast and one on the East Coast). Each year, we take and fill more custom rug orders.</p>
<p>It's time to take this fuzzy little business to the next level, and that means more exposure. We're ready for bigger shows, more wholesale clients, partnerships with vet offices and rescues... this is the seed money that will get us growing.</p>
<p>What's the eventual goal? There's that Holy Grail of ""quit your day jobs"" but let's be honest: that's a very long way off. But these rugs are something we love doing and strongly believe are a quality, valuable product.</p>
<p>The bottom line is: we want to share the RugLove. Doing any one of the above shows -- let alone multiple shows -- will help us do just that.</p>

Three years later, we've got a steady business, some fantastic and enthusiastic supporters, two wholesale clients, and the drive to keep expanding.
 


What We Need From You...
And What You Get From Us!
We have our eyes on some big shows in 2013 and 2014, like:

the Portland Pet Expo (October 2013) and the Seattle Pet Expo (April 2014)
the Portland Mini-Maker Faire and the New York World Maker Faire (both September 2013)
the Seattle Gift Show (August 2013) and the Portland Gift & Accessories Show (March 2014)
the NW Pet and Companion Animal Expo (April 2014 - our 2nd year)
the Oregon Humane Society Doggie Dash (May 2014 - our 3rd year)
and other events in the Portland, OR area

There are plenty of rugs just waiting for good homes... and mountains of materials for making even more fuzzy, loveable, huggable RugEmpire rugs. It's the entry fees and travel costs for these shows that makes them just a little bit (or in some cases, a LOT) out of our reach.
So that's what we're asking for: help with the entry fees. No, the $3100 we're asking for doesn't cover them entirely. But it covers a big chunk of them, plus some extra for marketing (advertising and promo items).
What's in it for you? Besides, of course, our everlasting gratitude?
All the rug-related memoribilia you could ever dream of. Bumper stickers, personalized pendants, and yes... RUGS. Want to learn how to make rugs the way we do? That's on offer, too.


Other Ways You Can Help Us Grow
Your encouragement and love means a lot to us! This really isn't just about the money. It's about our tribe believing in us, and in RugEmpire. It's about the energy and excitement you share with us.
 


Visit us at craft shows and expos. Lots of the shows we choose have free admission, so you can come and browse. It's awfully nice to see a friendly, familiar face.

Help spread the word about RugEmpire. Share our pics/links on the social networking site of your choice. We have a Facebook page, a website, and an Etsy shop any time you feel inclined to share.

Show off YOUR RugLove! If you have a RugEmpire rug, let us see some pics of you and your family enjoying the ruglove! Our Facebook page has a photo album for pictures of pets and their rugs.
Gimme that gogo factor -- share our indiegogo fundraiser on the social networking site of your choice. The bigger social reach we have, the better chance we have of being featured by indiegogo itself. More exposure = more gooder for our fundraiser.

Host a rug-a-thon or a toymaking session. It's always fun to take the crafty goodness on the road! You don't have to work, just keep us company.

Give the gift of display items: old folding tables, TV trays, storage tubs, tablecloths, and other stuff we could use for display at craft fairs. If you don't need them, that is. Our products are recycled, and most of our display is recycled, too (only the canopy is new).

Give the gift of supplies. Our rugs are made of scrap materials from a Pacific Northwest woolen mill... we'd be happy to have you take us scrap shopping.

Give the gift of rugs. Shop via Etsy, catch up with us at a craft fair, or if you're in the Portland, OR area you can have a private rug showing.
 
The Potential Impact of All This
RugEmpire has been slowly and consistiently growing over the last three years. We sold one lonely rug in 2010... so okay, that wasn't a hard goal to beat. Since then, we've learned a lot about the value of our product and our time, and about finding the right audience. Our little Etsy shop is chugging along. We've got three wholesale clients (two on the West Coast and one on the East Coast). Each year, we take and fill more custom rug orders.
It's time to take this fuzzy little business to the next level, and that means more exposure. We're ready for bigger shows, more wholesale clients, partnerships with vet offices and rescues... this is the seed money that will get us growing.
What's the eventual goal? There's that Holy Grail of ""quit your day jobs"" but let's be honest: that's a very long way off. But these rugs are something we love doing and strongly believe are a quality, valuable product.
The bottom line is: we want to share the RugLove. Doing any one of the above shows -- let alone multiple shows -- will help us do just that.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>#Or are you so busy that you can't recall the last time you paused for a moment after a cup of coffee?</strong></p>
<p>This is a story of transforming dreams into reality.</p>
<p>Tenmoku, also known as Jian Ware, is a legendary, precious type of porcelain that produces unique designs that are both mystical and unpredictable. It’s impossible to produce two identical Tenmoku porcelains. The name of Tenmoku comes from the word ""Tenmo (天目)"". It means the eyes of the sky in Chinese and Japanese.</p>
<p>Ever since my younger years, I have been fascinated by the nebula-like patterns produced by Tenmoku. This simple fascination with Tenmoku transformed into awe-inspiring respect upon learning that there are only 3 intact Yohen Tenmoku porcelains left from the Song Dynasty 800 years ago. Despite current potters possessing much more advanced techniques and devices for making pottery, they still can’t replicate the workmanship of the original Yohen Tenmokus!</p>
<div data-id=""27505004""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1580144618/ldzsp8mo6xhfh7s3ktfx.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p> </p>
<p>I was born in the Fujian Province of China. In China, tea drinking culture began thousands of years ago as far back as history has been recorded and it was in Fujian, that Tenmoku teacups were invented about a thousand years ago during the Song Dynasty.</p>
<p>Other than just being a cultural symbol, many elderly people from China and Japan appreciate Tenmoku for its potential ability to soften water and enhance flavour thanks to the special clay and glaze used to produce Tenmoku. One time when I was getting my morning cup of coffee, I serendipitously used a Tenmoku teacup for my coffee instead of my normal coffee cups. The feeling I got when drinking my coffee out of the Tenmoku was unlike anything else I had experienced with common coffee cups.</p>
<div data-id=""27517871""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1580144619/xued3wsj3tohwoqmqyah.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p> </p>
<p>Drinking my morning coffee out of the Tenmoku that day made me realize that there are no authentic Tenmoku coffee cups on the market currently and that the delicate and exquisite designs of Tenmoku perfectly match the elegant and fine flavours of coffee.</p>
<p>Then the epiphany, being an avid Kickstarter backer myself with having backed over 100 projects, I knew it was now time for me to embark on my first Kickstarter journey.</p>
<p>I hope that you can now join me in this wonderful porcelain adventure.</p>

<p>The unique geographical features of an area greatly influence the soil properties in that area. Fujian is situated in a mountainous territory near the ocean. The complexity of Fujian’s environment gave birth to unparalleled clay soils that create one-of-a-kind porcelain products. Tenmoku is made of naturally iron-rich clay that is hard to find anywhere else in the world besides Fujian. </p>
<div data-id=""27413971""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1580144623/th3ytagiavzyziudqss9.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p> </p>
<p>The chemical analysis shows that the clay and glaze of authentic Tenmokus can contain upwards of around 15% Fe2O3! This enables Tenmoku to attract magnets! I could hardly believe it when I first heard this stunning fact. I don’t think any ceramics found in the everyday home could do that!</p>
<div data-id=""27525331""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/dWqnXcSsw20GmLrQ2r/giphy.gif"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p> </p>
<p>Fujian’s incredible iron-rich soils are also the key to the unpredictable nebular patterns found on Tenmoku. Many other kilns located in different regions of China attempted to imitate Fujian Tenmoku and failed because their soils did not possess nearly enough iron.</p>
<div data-id=""27416689""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1580144625/qvvx5g8hkzru7ud70fxz.png"" src=""""/></figure></div> <div data-id=""27517908""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1580144625/o4njph9oxecayzfg98tp.png"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p> </p>
<p>In Chinese and Japanese tea culture, the water, the teapot, the teacup, and even the heating method used all affect the tea’s flavour. Tenmoku was originally designed with specific materials and shapes to bring out the best flavours of the tea and to present bubbles just right in tea ceremonies for matcha.</p>
<div data-id=""27413968""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1580144626/hngpzev32mmioqhzrogw.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p> </p>
<p>Although some might dismiss me as an idealist, I do taste subtle differences in tea and coffee when I drink them out of a Tenmoku rather than just an ordinary cup. The flavour of the drink appears to be amplified and longer-lasting and the liquid seem to flow more smoothly out of the Tenmoku.</p>
<p>The pottery master who helped us make some Tenmoku samples provided some relatively scientific explanations.</p>
<div data-id=""27515766""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1580144627/gcx2auv0yomm0hnca15p.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p> </p>
<p>Tenmoku formed a nanoporous surface on the glaze. The iron-rich glaze and clay may continuously release a small number of iron ions when in use.  Both of these may help absorb the residual chlorine and heavy metal in water. Additionally, the thick body of Tenmoku insulates heat better than other porcelain and ceramic cups.</p>
<p>Iron is an essential element for the human body, however, an increasing number of studies have shown that coffee and other caffeinated drinks can reduce iron absorption. Although there is no research on the exact amount of iron that is possibly leached out into coffee, cast iron cookware has been prescribed to patients combating anaemia. So at the very least, Tenmoku can help alleviate some of the guilt you feel when you overdose on coffee.</p>
<div data-id=""27525379""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/dU0gVTrz4D61p2XlWb/giphy.gif"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p> </p>
<p>A Tenmoku’s colour and patterns may even change slightly over many years of use and every time you finish a cup of coffee or tea, and you stare into the empty cup, you may get a relaxing moment of bliss as you ponder the mysterious pattern contained within the Tenmoku.</p>
<br/><br/><br/> <div data-id=""27517923""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1580144629/oxrqrkrnrd0kvceba6km.png"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p> </p>
<p>Lightning never strikes in the same place twice, and no potter can produce an identical Tenmoku.</p>
<p>Due to the art of happenstance, and akin to the concept of “Ichi-go Ichi-e” (once in a lifetime), Tenmoku is known for its unpredictable variability in its sophisticated factors of production including its clay, glaze, firing temperature, oxidizing atmosphere, and even its precise location inside the kiln.</p>
<p>Every Tenmoku is its own unique creation.</p>
<div data-id=""27495327""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1580144629/azoeqy5ymgtapc2ekajs.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p> </p>
<p>As the key to those nebular patterns, the iron-rich clay and glaze will form unpredictable iron crystals on the surface during the heating and cooling process.</p>
<p>In the hopes of producing many of the different possible nebular patterns for Tenmo, we’ve done a further study with Tenmoku potters on the subtle reactions in the production process.</p>
<p>Under increasingly higher firing temperatures, more oxygen dissolves and penetrates deeper into the surface, thus ferric oxide can be crystallized in a deeper and broader region in the ceramic. This then forms streak-like patterns on the surface when cooled.</p>
<div data-id=""27414016""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1580144630/koe2s9qtlpcfudrmfunm.png"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p> </p>
<p>While under lower firing temperatures, the dissolved oxygen concentrates at a shallower level in the ceramic and creates a more focused concentration below the surface. In these conditions, the surface of the ceramic will produce oval or round spots instead of streaks.</p>
<div data-id=""27414019""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1580144631/c3lurjrwiascvo6nzfmf.png"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p> </p>
<p>Tenmoku is fired in a very narrow temperature region (1,300℃ - 1,400℃) to create an ideal oxidizing atmosphere for producing iron oxide crystallites, which is different from most ceramics and potteries.</p>
<div data-id=""27425987""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1580144631/mwdpb3qgyclpivn0lyoh.png"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p> </p>
<p>Due to the chemical characteristics of iron, the various temperatures between 1,300℃ - 1,400℃ and the various cooling speeds cause Tenmoku to exhibit different colours in the finished product including dark plum, grey, silver, blue, yellow, and even multi-coloured.</p>
<div data-id=""27505008""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1580144632/g5y5fgpwgqvscihbtld9.png"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p> </p>
<p>If the firing process is carried out either too slowly or too quickly, then an undesirable deformation and blistering effect will result in the Tenmoku. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to produce a qualified Tenmoku with a beautiful appearance. Additionally, purely on the large randomness of Tenmoku creation, an unprecedented Tenmoku may appear accidentally in a potter’s kiln.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Adjusting the glaze formula and testing more and more combinations of firing techniques can lead us to the mystical patterns imbued by Tenmoku production. One of the first questions I had, when I came up with the Tenmoku coffee cup idea, was what kind of handle should be used to complement the beautiful nebulas inside the cup.</p>
<div data-id=""27456994""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1580144634/btyy26u7glv2ajrmmb2n.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p> </p>
<p>For getting a grip on this question, pun intended, I turned to my friend Lee for help. Lee graduated from one of the most famous academies of art &amp; design in China and is also fascinated by the idea of Tenmoku coffee cups. He helped me out immensely by providing me with a bunch of drafts and 3D models of the cups.</p>
<div data-id=""27456939""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1580144635/ia8blzplpf26u2rxgdmk.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p> </p>
<p>Despite greatly appreciate all the hard work he puts into each handle design, I rejected design after design not feeling that any of them matched Tenmoku. I wanted a handle design that coincided with Tenmoku’s destiny! I recited, again and again, everything I knew about Tenmoku to Lee, the history, the colours, and the legends hoping that this would help him to produce my dream design. Lee never believed that Tenmoku could attract magnets until he finally saw it for himself, and then one day he brought me this:</p>
<div data-id=""27505011""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1580144635/dav5kortuee8pn7ko8xx.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p> </p>
<p>With a concept in mind, I set out to visit master Sun Wenzha to get help in bringing our concept to life. He helped me realize why most ceramic cups all use the same boring handle. Fragile clay has a hard time resisting the influence of gravity. The conventional cup handle is very stable and can keep the breakage level at a relatively low rate. Master Sun Wenzha was extremely patient and open-minded, and he understood the image we had in my minds for the handle. We worked together for over 30 hours to create the optimal shape for the cup handle.</p>

<p>Honestly speaking, after working with many potters and kiln owners, I don’t think these Tenmoku cups will ever be some kind of standard product selling on e-commerce sites after this Kickstarter. The cups are more likely to be an unduplicated artwork rather than a product. Thanks to my vast experiences during the last few months, I have become friends with many potters and even more kiln owners. One of the kiln owners accompanied us on every step of the Tenmoku making process even though he had no obligation to. He missed two very important expos because of his ardent desire to help us with Tenmoku and he also invested a lot more money into formula testing than I ever paid him. It appears that both of us are just as obsessed with creating the perfect Tenmoku coffee cup with beautiful nebula-like patterns.</p>
<p>We set the base price as USD 99 and 134 because it is nigh impossible to acquire an authentic Tenmoku cup of this size for less than USD 100. The USD 134 Tenmo Nebula is even more special in that it’s a formula that we adjusted and tested ourselves. There is nothing else like it on the market and it is extremely similar to the Yohen Tenmoku from the Song Dynasty now preserved in the Fujita Museum. We’re thrilled to continue our journey and find the colours and patterns that will appear next!</p>
<p>To thank all the backers who join us in this great Tenmoku adventure, we set a price that barely covers the cost of production for the first 300 backers. We did this to simply share with as many people as possible the beauty and joy of Tenmoku. And yeah, I’m also well aware that USD 39 and 49 are already hefty prices for coffee cups.</p>

#Or are you so busy that you can't recall the last time you paused for a moment after a cup of coffee?
This is a story of transforming dreams into reality.
Tenmoku, also known as Jian Ware, is a legendary, precious type of porcelain that produces unique designs that are both mystical and unpredictable. It’s impossible to produce two identical Tenmoku porcelains. The name of Tenmoku comes from the word ""Tenmo (天目)"". It means the eyes of the sky in Chinese and Japanese.
Ever since my younger years, I have been fascinated by the nebula-like patterns produced by Tenmoku. This simple fascination with Tenmoku transformed into awe-inspiring respect upon learning that there are only 3 intact Yohen Tenmoku porcelains left from the Song Dynasty 800 years ago. Despite current potters possessing much more advanced techniques and devices for making pottery, they still can’t replicate the workmanship of the original Yohen Tenmokus!

 
I was born in the Fujian Province of China. In China, tea drinking culture began thousands of years ago as far back as history has been recorded and it was in Fujian, that Tenmoku teacups were invented about a thousand years ago during the Song Dynasty.
Other than just being a cultural symbol, many elderly people from China and Japan appreciate Tenmoku for its potential ability to soften water and enhance flavour thanks to the special clay and glaze used to produce Tenmoku. One time when I was getting my morning cup of coffee, I serendipitously used a Tenmoku teacup for my coffee instead of my normal coffee cups. The feeling I got when drinking my coffee out of the Tenmoku was unlike anything else I had experienced with common coffee cups.

 
Drinking my morning coffee out of the Tenmoku that day made me realize that there are no authentic Tenmoku coffee cups on the market currently and that the delicate and exquisite designs of Tenmoku perfectly match the elegant and fine flavours of coffee.
Then the epiphany, being an avid Kickstarter backer myself with having backed over 100 projects, I knew it was now time for me to embark on my first Kickstarter journey.
I hope that you can now join me in this wonderful porcelain adventure.
 

 
 
The unique geographical features of an area greatly influence the soil properties in that area. Fujian is situated in a mountainous territory near the ocean. The complexity of Fujian’s environment gave birth to unparalleled clay soils that create one-of-a-kind porcelain products. Tenmoku is made of naturally iron-rich clay that is hard to find anywhere else in the world besides Fujian. 

 
The chemical analysis shows that the clay and glaze of authentic Tenmokus can contain upwards of around 15% Fe2O3! This enables Tenmoku to attract magnets! I could hardly believe it when I first heard this stunning fact. I don’t think any ceramics found in the everyday home could do that!

 
Fujian’s incredible iron-rich soils are also the key to the unpredictable nebular patterns found on Tenmoku. Many other kilns located in different regions of China attempted to imitate Fujian Tenmoku and failed because their soils did not possess nearly enough iron.
 
 
In Chinese and Japanese tea culture, the water, the teapot, the teacup, and even the heating method used all affect the tea’s flavour. Tenmoku was originally designed with specific materials and shapes to bring out the best flavours of the tea and to present bubbles just right in tea ceremonies for matcha.

 
Although some might dismiss me as an idealist, I do taste subtle differences in tea and coffee when I drink them out of a Tenmoku rather than just an ordinary cup. The flavour of the drink appears to be amplified and longer-lasting and the liquid seem to flow more smoothly out of the Tenmoku.
The pottery master who helped us make some Tenmoku samples provided some relatively scientific explanations.

 
Tenmoku formed a nanoporous surface on the glaze. The iron-rich glaze and clay may continuously release a small number of iron ions when in use.  Both of these may help absorb the residual chlorine and heavy metal in water. Additionally, the thick body of Tenmoku insulates heat better than other porcelain and ceramic cups.
Iron is an essential element for the human body, however, an increasing number of studies have shown that coffee and other caffeinated drinks can reduce iron absorption. Although there is no research on the exact amount of iron that is possibly leached out into coffee, cast iron cookware has been prescribed to patients combating anaemia. So at the very least, Tenmoku can help alleviate some of the guilt you feel when you overdose on coffee.

 
A Tenmoku’s colour and patterns may even change slightly over many years of use and every time you finish a cup of coffee or tea, and you stare into the empty cup, you may get a relaxing moment of bliss as you ponder the mysterious pattern contained within the Tenmoku.
 
 
Lightning never strikes in the same place twice, and no potter can produce an identical Tenmoku.
Due to the art of happenstance, and akin to the concept of “Ichi-go Ichi-e” (once in a lifetime), Tenmoku is known for its unpredictable variability in its sophisticated factors of production including its clay, glaze, firing temperature, oxidizing atmosphere, and even its precise location inside the kiln.
Every Tenmoku is its own unique creation.

 
As the key to those nebular patterns, the iron-rich clay and glaze will form unpredictable iron crystals on the surface during the heating and cooling process.
In the hopes of producing many of the different possible nebular patterns for Tenmo, we’ve done a further study with Tenmoku potters on the subtle reactions in the production process.
Under increasingly higher firing temperatures, more oxygen dissolves and penetrates deeper into the surface, thus ferric oxide can be crystallized in a deeper and broader region in the ceramic. This then forms streak-like patterns on the surface when cooled.

 
While under lower firing temperatures, the dissolved oxygen concentrates at a shallower level in the ceramic and creates a more focused concentration below the surface. In these conditions, the surface of the ceramic will produce oval or round spots instead of streaks.

 
Tenmoku is fired in a very narrow temperature region (1,300℃ - 1,400℃) to create an ideal oxidizing atmosphere for producing iron oxide crystallites, which is different from most ceramics and potteries.

 
Due to the chemical characteristics of iron, the various temperatures between 1,300℃ - 1,400℃ and the various cooling speeds cause Tenmoku to exhibit different colours in the finished product including dark plum, grey, silver, blue, yellow, and even multi-coloured.

 
If the firing process is carried out either too slowly or too quickly, then an undesirable deformation and blistering effect will result in the Tenmoku. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to produce a qualified Tenmoku with a beautiful appearance. Additionally, purely on the large randomness of Tenmoku creation, an unprecedented Tenmoku may appear accidentally in a potter’s kiln.


 
Adjusting the glaze formula and testing more and more combinations of firing techniques can lead us to the mystical patterns imbued by Tenmoku production. One of the first questions I had, when I came up with the Tenmoku coffee cup idea, was what kind of handle should be used to complement the beautiful nebulas inside the cup.

 
For getting a grip on this question, pun intended, I turned to my friend Lee for help. Lee graduated from one of the most famous academies of art & design in China and is also fascinated by the idea of Tenmoku coffee cups. He helped me out immensely by providing me with a bunch of drafts and 3D models of the cups.

 
Despite greatly appreciate all the hard work he puts into each handle design, I rejected design after design not feeling that any of them matched Tenmoku. I wanted a handle design that coincided with Tenmoku’s destiny! I recited, again and again, everything I knew about Tenmoku to Lee, the history, the colours, and the legends hoping that this would help him to produce my dream design. Lee never believed that Tenmoku could attract magnets until he finally saw it for himself, and then one day he brought me this:

 
With a concept in mind, I set out to visit master Sun Wenzha to get help in bringing our concept to life. He helped me realize why most ceramic cups all use the same boring handle. Fragile clay has a hard time resisting the influence of gravity. The conventional cup handle is very stable and can keep the breakage level at a relatively low rate. Master Sun Wenzha was extremely patient and open-minded, and he understood the image we had in my minds for the handle. We worked together for over 30 hours to create the optimal shape for the cup handle.
 





 







 
 
Honestly speaking, after working with many potters and kiln owners, I don’t think these Tenmoku cups will ever be some kind of standard product selling on e-commerce sites after this Kickstarter. The cups are more likely to be an unduplicated artwork rather than a product. Thanks to my vast experiences during the last few months, I have become friends with many potters and even more kiln owners. One of the kiln owners accompanied us on every step of the Tenmoku making process even though he had no obligation to. He missed two very important expos because of his ardent desire to help us with Tenmoku and he also invested a lot more money into formula testing than I ever paid him. It appears that both of us are just as obsessed with creating the perfect Tenmoku coffee cup with beautiful nebula-like patterns.
We set the base price as USD 99 and 134 because it is nigh impossible to acquire an authentic Tenmoku cup of this size for less than USD 100. The USD 134 Tenmo Nebula is even more special in that it’s a formula that we adjusted and tested ourselves. There is nothing else like it on the market and it is extremely similar to the Yohen Tenmoku from the Song Dynasty now preserved in the Fujita Museum. We’re thrilled to continue our journey and find the colours and patterns that will appear next!
To thank all the backers who join us in this great Tenmoku adventure, we set a price that barely covers the cost of production for the first 300 backers. We did this to simply share with as many people as possible the beauty and joy of Tenmoku. And yeah, I’m also well aware that USD 39 and 49 are already hefty prices for coffee cups.

 
 
We’ve worked with many potters to complete a few worthy Tenmo cups, but we still haven’t tested all the candidate formulas for the glaze. We may also continue to adjust the size and shape of the handles. The potential to enhance appearance is still large and we want to produce something extraordinary and beautiful. To continue on our journey, we need to place a lot more orders to the kiln.
The good news is that the kiln we’re working with is one of the most experienced kilns in Fujian employing many skilful and highly talented potters. Because every process for manufacturing Tenmoku requires the utmost care and delicate control, a professional kiln is essential to ensuring high-quality products.


 
Let alone the financial side of things, I also would like to share my work with more and more people from all around the world. Tenmoku should not merely be an ancient art representing traditional Chinese and Japanese ways of living but should be an intricate art piece made from endless coincidence that brings a sense of calm and power to coffee and tea drinkers alike.

Some want to be doctors and some want to be lawyers.<br/>There was a boy who dreamed of becoming a robotics engineer. Taegu Noh, CEO and Founder of PurrSong, was just an average cat lover when he was a student. After finishing his school years, he joined the ROK Navy as an officer. There was a street cat near his base and he felt pity so he brought him, took care of him and raised him for about a year. One day Taegu saw the cat was limping so he took him to the hospital. Sadly, the cat was diagnosed with kidney failure and he died a week later. Taegu was overwhelmed with grief and thought about how to prevent sudden death caused by urinary disease. He decided to make an automatic litter box which can keep track of cats’ urinary health to provide a better quality of life to all cats.</p><p>In 2017, Taegu established PurrSong with six other members to put his idea into practice. Talents from diverse backgrounds come together to develop the most innovative automatic litter box. The LavvieBot, the first-generation model, was born. It was decent but not superb as members of PurrSong expected. All of the members worked so hard and improved LavvieBot’s performance and functions.

Some want to be doctors and some want to be lawyers.There was a boy who dreamed of becoming a robotics engineer. Taegu Noh, CEO and Founder of PurrSong, was just an average cat lover when he was a student. After finishing his school years, he joined the ROK Navy as an officer. There was a street cat near his base and he felt pity so he brought him, took care of him and raised him for about a year. One day Taegu saw the cat was limping so he took him to the hospital. Sadly, the cat was diagnosed with kidney failure and he died a week later. Taegu was overwhelmed with grief and thought about how to prevent sudden death caused by urinary disease. He decided to make an automatic litter box which can keep track of cats’ urinary health to provide a better quality of life to all cats.In 2017, Taegu established PurrSong with six other members to put his idea into practice. Talents from diverse backgrounds come together to develop the most innovative automatic litter box. The LavvieBot, the first-generation model, was born. It was decent but not superb as members of PurrSong expected. All of the members worked so hard and improved LavvieBot’s performance and functions. And now, here comes LavvieBot S.    What Media Say about LavvieBot S        What Previous Backers Say about LavvieBot S    What LavvieBot S Can Do  1. Auto cleanIf you are too busy to clean up the litter box regularly or are forced to leave your home without cleaning job, the litter box will become dirty and stink.The litter box filled with excrement is a bad influence on the cat.LavvieBot S is able to efficiently get rid of the excreta just through a patented rotating rake mechanism. When the cat's done its business in LavvieBot S, it automatically starts cleaning after a certain amount of wait time.The time can be set by users from 15 to 90 minutes and this gives enough time for excrements to get harden so even diarrhea can be perfectly taken care of.In addition, LavvieBot S used non-sticky material on the bottom of the tray so it always keeps itself hygienically clean.  LavvieBot's waste drawer is designed large enough (16.1*4.7*6.3"") to collect waste for up to 3 weeks. You may cover a plastic bag on the waste drawer when you use it and you can simply throw the plastic bag away for disposal.      2. Auto refillLavvieBot S automatically refills litter from its 6.5L extra storage after cleaning so it keeps the inside of LavvieBot S in top shape for your cats at all times.     3. Compatible with ‘PurrSong’ appLavvieBot S App, ‘PurrSong’ enables you to monitor your cat in real-time and provide you other information needed. 1) Able to Check the LavvieBot's statusThrough the App ‘PurrSong’, users are able to check the status of LavvieBot. 2) Litter Box UsageThe app keeps track of how often and how long your cat uses LavvieBot S so you can always stay on top of your cat’s health. LavvieBot S also recognize each cat in a multi-cat household if their weights differ by more than 1.5 lb.If the weights are similar, cats can be distinguished through the ID tag that will be selling in the near future.  3) Customized NotificationThe notification alarms could be set to four different types, including Default, Cute, and Custom mode. Each notification from your cat will brighten up your day.   4) Be Smart All the TimeLavvieBot's Firmware update is available through your mobile device. Wirelessly.This wireless update which can be done by touching it for your mobile app will make your LavvieBot S even smarter.   See How Cat Uses LavvieBot S for 21 DaysLavvieBot S keeps itself clean for up to 21 days per cat.    Check Our Highlights1) Prevent Cat Litter Tracking  The footrest is properly placed inside of LavvieBot S to prevent cat litter tracking. 2) Prevent Odor LavvieBot S effectively neutralizes odor through its activated coconut carbon deodorizer. The deodorizer absorbs up to 93.3% of ammonia and also functions as a dehumidifier. By replacing it once or twice every year, LavvieBot S will prevent most of the odors and keep your place pleasant. 3) Low-NoiseLavvieBot S’s noise level is only 26.5dB (Decibels), which is less than the noise level of an average residential bedroom, so the noise wouldn't bother your cat.    4) Easy to WashAfter opening the door on the side, you can easily detach the litter tray by pressing the ""Empty"" button. You may clean the tray and seperator with water if you want to keep it cleaner.   What Makes LavvieBot S Design Different?1) 20% Less SpaceCompared to other litter boxes on the market, LavvieBot S takes up more than 20% less space. Furthermore, it is designed considering the optimal size and shape that can go very well with the house.W19.5"" X D22.9"" X H 27.7"" 2) Comfy Enough for PrivacyDue to its inner dimensions (12.5*17*14.2”), LavvieBot S can be fitted comfortably for most of the cats. Besides, the tray contains up to 6L of the litter, which is 50% more than other automatic litter boxes.  ""Footage of Large 16.5lb Cat Using LavvieBot"" 3) Easy ControlThe LED display enables the users to easily see the internal and operation states of Lavviebot S. Plus, the operation buttons associated with the indicator lights are placed directly on the lower part so that the users can recognize the functions of the buttons. 4) Safety – 3 Types of SensorsSafety, above all, is always the first consideration. LavvieBot S's indented buttons are placed on the front to prevent cats from pressing them accidentally.If the cat tries to enter when LavvieBot S is on auto-clean mode, the infrared sensor in the front immediately detects its entry and switches the separator to standby.This allows the cats to be perfectly safe and use LavvieBot S anytime they want to.  What PurrSong will provide youin the future1) One-Touch Order SystemWhen the litter level is getting low, the app notifies and immediately provides a way of purchasing the litter (One-touch order system may not be possible in certain areas depending on the circumstances/country) 2) Connecting with Other ‘PurrSong’ DevicesWe will have various PurrSong pet appliances in our lineup such as ID tag, auto water fountain, auto feeder and etc. in the future. We will try to gather as many data as possible so we can help to detect any disease or health problems for our pet in advance.   Timeline

<h3><strong>Lucy is your home's superhero.</strong></h3>
<p>She's an AI-powered home robot that keeps learning her environment and protects the family while she cleans. Lucy comes with a <strong>1080P HDR color camera</strong> and a <strong>depth sensor</strong> that ensures night vision, providing unique day and night surveillance functionality on a mobile platform. </p>
<p>Lucy is the first smart home robot to <strong>recognize and divide rooms automatically</strong>. With an advanced 6-core ARM SoC, Lucy pushes the limit of accurate and efficient inference and brings edge AI to reality. For example, when she sees a bed in a room, she would recognize it as a bed. Together with object recognition and advanced scene understanding capability, she would label the room as a bedroom. </p>
<p>While most home robots cannot recognize obstacles less than 4” tall, Lucy sees it all,<strong> down to 1”</strong>. Slippers, lost socks, moving pets, and even unexpected pet accidents never come into contact with her. Whatever you need, she's got you covered!</p>

<h3><strong>A Bit About Lucy</strong></h3>
<p>You might wonder if we named Lucy after the Beatles track, ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,"" or the American television sitcom, “I Love Lucy.” Truth is, the birth of Lucy was inspired by the oldest hominin skeleton ever discovered, who illuminates the human evolution timeline. Her discovery altered our understanding of human evolution, just as Trifo Lucy’s birth rewrites our company history. With the introduction of Lucy, we officially evolved from a smart robot vacuum maker into an AI home robot company.</p>
<p>As a young yet ambitious startup, our vision is to build a family of home robots that enhance people’s lives and let them focus on what’s important. To bring Lucy to life, our team has spent years developing highly advanced algorithms, deep learning models, and AI-based robotic intelligence. <strong>That’s why she’s able to keep learning the environment by herself, interact with the family members when needed, and keep an eye out for the possible intruders. </strong></p>
<p> </p>

<p>There’s nothing that can escape Lucy's sight. Her 1080p HD camera and infrared camera can stream live video and audio during the day or night!</p>
<p>Lucy is sensitive to any slight movements while you’re away from home. If something’s amiss, you’ll be the first to know where and when it happened. </p>

<p>Lucy is always aware of her surroundings. While most home robots cannot recognize obstacles less than 4” tall, Lucy can scan, detect, and avoid obstacles under 1"", such as slippers and scattered socks using an advanced real-time object detection with a combination of proprietary 3D geometry and 3D semantics algorithms.</p>

She's an AI-powered home robot that keeps learning her environment and protects the family while she cleans. Lucy comes with a 1080P HDR color camera and a depth sensor that ensures night vision, providing unique day and night surveillance functionality on a mobile platform. 
Lucy is the first smart home robot to recognize and divide rooms automatically. With an advanced 6-core ARM SoC, Lucy pushes the limit of accurate and efficient inference and brings edge AI to reality. For example, when she sees a bed in a room, she would recognize it as a bed. Together with object recognition and advanced scene understanding capability, she would label the room as a bedroom. 
While most home robots cannot recognize obstacles less than 4” tall, Lucy sees it all, down to 1”. Slippers, lost socks, moving pets, and even unexpected pet accidents never come into contact with her. Whatever you need, she's got you covered!


 
A Bit About Lucy
You might wonder if we named Lucy after the Beatles track, ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,"" or the American television sitcom, “I Love Lucy.” Truth is, the birth of Lucy was inspired by the oldest hominin skeleton ever discovered, who illuminates the human evolution timeline. Her discovery altered our understanding of human evolution, just as Trifo Lucy’s birth rewrites our company history. With the introduction of Lucy, we officially evolved from a smart robot vacuum maker into an AI home robot company.
As a young yet ambitious startup, our vision is to build a family of home robots that enhance people’s lives and let them focus on what’s important. To bring Lucy to life, our team has spent years developing highly advanced algorithms, deep learning models, and AI-based robotic intelligence. That’s why she’s able to keep learning the environment by herself, interact with the family members when needed, and keep an eye out for the possible intruders. 
 


There’s nothing that can escape Lucy's sight. Her 1080p HD camera and infrared camera can stream live video and audio during the day or night!
Lucy is sensitive to any slight movements while you’re away from home. If something’s amiss, you’ll be the first to know where and when it happened. 
 
Lucy's Night Vision: 



 
 

Lucy is always aware of her surroundings. While most home robots cannot recognize obstacles less than 4” tall, Lucy can scan, detect, and avoid obstacles under 1"", such as slippers and scattered socks using an advanced real-time object detection with a combination of proprietary 3D geometry and 3D semantics algorithms.
 
And Yes, She Avoids Pet Poop!

Lucy is built to serve and protect. At every opportunity, she takes the time to learn more about our home. Utilizing the onboard camera imagery and my active depth sensor, Lucy develops detailed indoor maps, devises efficient cleaning and patrol routes, and automatically divides and names your rooms, so you don’t have to.  Lucy Not Only Vacuums, But Mops!Lucy not only vacuums and monitors, but also mops. Lucy comes with a mopping pad and a water tank (86ml) that can be attached to the bottom of the robot. If you have vinyl, tile, or hardwood floor at home—especially in bathrooms and the kitchen—Lucy can add an extra level of clean to your routine! The whole family can interact with Lucy in several ways. Because it's Alexa-enabled, Lucy reacts when hearing simple voice commands.Just ask, “Alexa, turn on Lucy” and she will get to work. When you're away from home, you can see, speak, and listen to other family members, pets, or even intruders when connected through the Trifo Home App.  Crumbs, pet hair, and dust don’t stand a chance to the optimized brushes and 3,000 Pa of suction of Lucy. She attacks deep into corners with her six-claw side brush—nothing can escape. The larger dustbin and washable primary filter make it easier for Lucy to stay sharp and ready for any mess. The perfect sidekick for Lucy is here! Program her remotely to set no-go lines, pre-define patrolling routes, and more. You can even manually drive Lucy from your phone or tablet. The free app is available for download on the Apple App Store and Google Play.To see is to believe! Let's see how Lucy works with the app after she finishes mapping your home and creates a floor map.

Set ""No-Go"" Zones: Don't want Lucy to go in certain rooms or areas? Just tell her where to avoid by selecting No-Go zones on your map.

Define Patrol Routes: Pin specific locations on the map, and Lucy will follow the routes accordingly.

Clean Designated Areas: Easily direct Lucy where to go by framing certain rooms or areas on the map.
  One-Step Wi-Fi ConnectionWe've heard stories about how Wi-Fi configuration scares people away when they first set up their home robot. To make the setup fast and smooth, we simplified the Wi-Fi configuration process, allowing users to connect Lucy to their home Wi-Fi by scanning the QR code.

She seems like the average capturer of crumbs, pet hair, and dust, but Lucy has a secret. She has the vision and intelligence more powerful than some of the best home surveillance devices out there. She protects and cleans her home 24/7, ensuring every family member can focus on what’s important.  *See more FAQs in the FAQ section! Our Final PickWe chose the current design because it is our vision to perfect people's lives by offer them the optimal balance between family, work, and personal life. ""Trifo is a newcomer to the robot vacuum market, but the Lucy is aiming to advance what's possible in object recognition. It features two cameras—one for HD color imaging and one for depth recognition—that are able to discern objects as small as one inch in height. The color camera also live-streams to your phone if you want to peek into your house while you're gone. Additionally, the Lucy can automatically divide rooms without the need for magnetic strips."" —Reviewed.comPrior to the creation of Trifo, Zhang was co-founder and CEO of PerceptIn, a full-stack visual intelligence company aimed at making scalable hardware/software integrated solutions for autonomous robotics systems.

</div></div>","Stormforce has developed an innovative and unique spiral-funnel wind turbine 
ensuring the efficient and continuous production of clean and free energy, 
in any outdoor location, even in low wind.


Our spiral-funnel wind turbine in use for drinking water treatment and/or irrigation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Totally silent and completely customizable our wind turbine, often described as
 resembling a piece of sculptured art, integrates seamlessly into its 
environment and surroundings.







Our aims, our vision :
Primarily, we want to make clean energy accessible to everyone, everywhere,
everyday.
Private residential usage of our wind turbines as well as business and agricultural 
usage will be core components to achieving our aims and goals. However, our vision
 also extends to helping governments serve and manage their national/regional 
energy requirements, especially in underdeveloped regions and countries. 
The supply and installation of our spiral-funnel wind turbines in underdeveloped 
regions and countries can be affordably financed by corporate sponsorship as well 
as government and private funding, to the mutual benefit of everyone. 


How?


Each turbine with a completely customizable surface area of 6.9m² (74.5ft²) offers 
a unique and flexible medium for communication and advertising campaigns,
providing innovative visibility to companies and organisations at a very competitive 
price.
The energy produced, not only is it clean and green, it is FREE. This free energy can
 provide endless benefits to the local communities, supplying energy for :


 -> drinking water treatments (water pumps, well and filtration systems),
 -> agricultural advances (water pumps and irrigation systems),
 -> domestic usage (lighting, cooking, heating/air-      conditioning, water/sanitary systems)
 -> educational programmes (accessing internet and TV/radio, lighting, heating/

         air-conditioning, water/sanitary systems),
 -> medical and health programmes (medical equipment, lighting, heating/

     air-conditioning, 
water/sanitary systems) 

Following are some typical installation types and usages :




Private use, home energy requirements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Clubs & Associations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Rural & Mountainous areas
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Limited access, ""off-grid"" sites

At KRUVE, our aim is to elevate the coffee experience by designing beautiful, innovative, and high quality products. That's not an empty promise - we can 'Walk the Talk' too! We've crowdfunded multiple projects and have successfully exceeded our crowdfunding goal each time. Add to that, the products we've crowdfunded went on to win top awards. This time around, we're re-imagining the way we consume espresso. 
Introducing the PROPEL espresso glass! 

By leveraging key design features like headspace, internal fins, and a double-to-single-walled construction, the PROPEL is taking espresso to new heights! 

We can't wait for you to experience espresso in the PROPEL.


 

 

 
In Early 2019, we took home - not one, but two - of the Specialty Coffee Association’s most coveted awards for our EQ glassware line, including Best New Product and the Design Lab Award.   

We took the lessons we learned from the research and development of our EXCITE and INSPIRE glasses, and applied that same design-thinking to our PROPEL espresso glass. 
 


The PROPEL is specifically designed for espresso unlike any other glass. The Patent Pending design centers around these key features:

 


The PROPEL features a robust amount of headspace to capture and circulate aroma, involving the nose in a meaningful way, and enhancing flavor like never before.


 

 
The PROPEL uses internal fins and a convex bottom to help destratify the espresso layers as they separate, providing you with a consistent flavor in every sip.   

Why is this important? World Champion Barista and Industry Expert, James Hoffmann explains...

 

The PROPEL is shaped in a way that encourages you to cup the glass in your hand, which makes swirling natural and intuitive. 
 
When swirled, the espresso coats the inside of the glass, highlighting aromas even further.

 


As with all other glassware in the EQ line, the PROPEL features a double-to-single-wall construction, so the coffee will remain hot, while cool to the touch. 

 


We made the PROPEL dishwasher-safe so it's easy to clean once your done enjoying your espresso. 

 


 
We were lucky to have the PROPEL Espresso glass tested and reviewed by many of our friends and colleagues in the community, including the world's top coffee experts and sensory scientists! Here is just a sample of what they had to say:
 As espresso brews, the liquid quickly stratifies and separates into layers based on density, gasses, soluble and insoluble solids.  Each layer has a different taste so stirring the espresso to combine all those layers is vital to get the most consistent flavour throughout the entire shot.Don't take our word for it, listen to what World Champion Barista and Industry Expert, James Hoffmann has to say about it... For decades, espresso has been consumed via a tiny ceramic cup, which definitely helps when you’re in a rush, but that’s about it.  Today, we know that espresso has evolved into a much more robust coffee drinking experience, with attention being paid to the entire supply chain. From growing to roasting - and especially the espresso machines themselves - espresso has evolved in leaps and bounds. However, espresso glassware has mostly remained stagnant.  We also know that glassware significantly impacts the way you consume a beverage. For example, if someone pours you Whiskey in a shot glass, you’re likely going to slam it back. However, if we pour that same whiskey into a snifter glass, you will take time to savor the rich aromas and flavor notes. Espresso is no different. When served in a tiny ceramic cup, we instinctively shoot it back. However, when poured into a PROPEL glass, you will naturally want to swirl it, smell it, and sip it slowly. That’s why our patent-pending espresso glass applies precisely these design principles.    The glasses are in production now and should start shipping in Late December 2019.Be sure to order asap! Our first PRODUCTION RUN HAS SOLD OUT so order now to get in on round two and we will ship on a first-come, first-served basis. Shipping starts December 2019 for round two of production.  The PROPEL is a small, but mighty addition to the award-winning KRUVE EQ family!

Sounds great right?

 From our health to our oceans to our economy, it’s an unsustainable material that’s slowly choking every aspect of our livelihood.  
 
Plastic is killing us and our planet.In fact, nearly all of us have traces of the chemicals already in us due to plastic use. Exposure to these chemicals is linked to cancer, birth defects, impaired immunity, infertility, mental disease, endocrine disruption, and other ailments. Additionally, plastic poisons our food and water sources. 
 Plastic doesn’t break down, it breaks up into tiny microscopic pieces and gets stored in the fatty tissue of the foods we eat and in the water we drink.Everything suffers because of plastic pollution — tourism, recreation, business, the health of humans, animals, fish, and birds. In fact, plastic presence costs about $13 billion a year in losses for the tourism, shipping, and fishing industries alone,  The financial damage continuously being inflicted across the world and every industry is inestimable.
 
 Imagine a world without plastic—a world where we don’t have to worry about destroying our oceans and the air we breathe. It’s time to take a real stand and show up for our planet and ourselves by making 2019 the year we go plastic free.We’ve been selling our wraps and bags on our website for some time now - and it’s been great. Our goal is to offer all the best plastic free household solutions in one place at an affordable price. 
 In order to fulfill our mission, we wanted to give everyone the ability to convert fully to a plastic-free lifestyle without buffer. This is why we chose to launch our full line on Indiegogo through a membership subscription. We’re able to fund production without outside investors, and you get up to 50% OFF on our premium products for LIFE. Plus, you’ll get first access to new products down the line.Be A Member Now - If you back our membership reward tiers, you become a member immediately after our campaign ends! This means you immediately get all the membership benefits, including up to 50% OFF of products on our website.

<h3>FAQs</h3>
<p><strong>Is WLabs first to market with this type of device?               </strong></p>
<p>We believe we are the first to market in the U.S. with an indoor food recycler that converts a week's worth of food waste into ready-to-use homemade fertilizer within 24 hours.* Competitive products take at least a week to process and the output is not as uniform. There are other products on the market in the U.S. that are purely ""food dehydrators"" that do not have an additive and do not progress the food decomposition as far as Zera™ Food Recycler.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How does Zera™ Food Recycler work?    </strong></p>
<p>The Zera™ device uses oxygen, moisture, heat, and agitation to speed decomposition of a week's worth of food scraps within 24 hours*. The additive provides the ""brown"" material necessary for the decomposition process.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How is the Zera™ food recycling process different from the traditional composting process?        </strong></p>
<p>The Zera™ food recycling process converts food waste into fertilizer through a fully automatic process, accepts a variety of food types including meat and dairy, and can be performed inside your home within 24 hours.* Unlike traditional composting, Zera™ Food Recycler automatically controls moisture, heat, air, and the process is not exposed to unwanted pests or wildlife. Traditional composting takes months to process, requires a large outdoor space, manual heap maintenance, and can attract pests and wildlife.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What types of food can the Zera™ device recycle?             </strong></p>
<p>The Zera™ device can recycle 95% of a typical family’s household food waste (including meat and dairy). It is not recommended to recycle large bones and pits.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How large is the unit?     </strong></p>
<p>Zera™ Food Recycler is designed to seamlessly fit in your kitchen. It is counter height so that food scraps can easily be deposited into the unit. The dimensions are 11""W x 22""D x 33.75""H.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How much does the unit weigh?</strong></p>
<p>Zera™ Food Recycler weighs 118.6 pounds (53.8 kilograms).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How much energy does the device use per year?       </strong></p>
<p>The Zera™ Food Recycler energy consumption is approximately 300 kWh/year, assuming a cycle is run once a week.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How often do I need to run a cycle?</strong></p>
<p>A cycle should be run once food waste is filled to the top of the mixing blades. It can be run more frequently if desired, even daily. The Zera™ Additive must be used each time you run a cycle.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How long does it take a cycle to run?       </strong></p>
<p>A cycle will complete within 24 hours.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Once a cycle is started, can it be paused to add additional food waste?    </strong></p>
<p>Yes, once the cycle is started, you can pause it during the first 30 minutes to add additional food. Once it is past 30 minutes, it cannot be paused, but the cycle can be cancelled.  If cancelled, the cycle will restart when the Start button is pressed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why can't food scraps be added after the 30-minute window has passed?               </strong></p>
<p>The device needs enough time to fully process any food added to the cycle.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Is the device child-resistant?       </strong></p>
<p>Yes, the controls can be locked out (through the control panel or the mobile app). Additionally, the lid locks when the cycle is active, so children cannot access the mixing compartment. Finally, there is a retention tab on the output bin.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Is there anything special required for installation?            </strong></p>
<p>No, simply plug Zera™ Food Recycler into a standard power outlet. It has a 6-foot power cord to provide flexibility of placement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is the output of Zera™ Food Recycler?         </strong></p>
<p>The output of Zera™ Food Recycler is a ready-to-use, homemade fertilizer that can be used on lawns and gardens. It appears similar to coffee grounds, is dry, and spreads easily.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Is the homemade fertilizer the same as compost?              </strong></p>
<p>The homemade fertilizer is not standard compost because it is not created from a traditional outdoor composting process. Instead, it is a ready-to-use homemade fertilizer that, once spread on the lawn and garden, will release nutrients into the soil as it continues to mature.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How should the output be used?                </strong></p>
<p>The homemade fertilizer should only be used outdoors. It is recommended to apply the homemade fertilizer on the soil surface, not to exceed ¼-inch thick. Keep the product away from roots and plant stems.</p>
<p>The homemade fertilizer can also be broadcast on grass using a lawn spreader.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How should the homemade fertilizer be stored?                </strong></p>
<p>The homemade fertilizer should be stored in an air-tight container in a cool, dry area (i.e., garage, basement, closet) for up to six months.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Will the homemade fertilizer attract bugs during storage?             </strong></p>
<p>The homemade fertilizer should not attract insects, especially if stored in an air-tight container as recommended.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is the Zera™ Additive made out of?</strong></p>
<p>The Zera™ Additive is made from coir and baking soda. Coir is made from coconut husk, a rapidly renewable plant-based resource. The Zera™ Additive Pack is made from paper and designed so the entire additive (including bag packaging) can be placed in the Zera™ device.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How often do I need to use the Zera™ Additive?                 </strong></p>
<p>One Zera™ Additive Pack is used every time a cycle is run. It is estimated that on average, a U.S. family will run a cycle once a week.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How does the Zera™ Air Filter work? What is it made of?                  </strong></p>
<p>The filter within the Zera™ device is made of activated carbon and HEPA layers, designed to continuously filter the air.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>H</strong><strong>ow long does the Zera™ Air Filter last?  How frequently should it be changed? </strong></p>
<p>For best performance, the Zera™ Air Filter should be changed every two months.</p>

There are other products on the market in the U.S. that are purely ""food dehydrators"" that do not have an additive and do not progress the food decomposition as far as Zera™ Food Recycler.
 
How does Zera™ Food Recycler work?    
The Zera™ device uses oxygen, moisture, heat, and agitation to speed decomposition of a week's worth of food scraps within 24 hours*. The additive provides the ""brown"" material necessary for the decomposition process.
 
How is the Zera™ food recycling process different from the traditional composting process?        
The Zera™ food recycling process converts food waste into fertilizer through a fully automatic process, accepts a variety of food types including meat and dairy, and can be performed inside your home within 24 hours.* Unlike traditional composting, Zera™ Food Recycler automatically controls moisture, heat, air, and the process is not exposed to unwanted pests or wildlife. Traditional composting takes months to process, requires a large outdoor space, manual heap maintenance, and can attract pests and wildlife.
 
What types of food can the Zera™ device recycle?             
The Zera™ device can recycle 95% of a typical family’s household food waste (including meat and dairy). It is not recommended to recycle large bones and pits.  
 
How large is the unit?     
Zera™ Food Recycler is designed to seamlessly fit in your kitchen. It is counter height so that food scraps can easily be deposited into the unit. The dimensions are 11""W x 22""D x 33.75""H.
 
How much does the unit weigh?
Zera™ Food Recycler weighs 118.6 pounds (53.8 kilograms).
 
How much energy does the device use per year?       
The Zera™ Food Recycler energy consumption is approximately 300 kWh/year, assuming a cycle is run once a week.
 
How often do I need to run a cycle?
A cycle should be run once food waste is filled to the top of the mixing blades. It can be run more frequently if desired, even daily. The Zera™ Additive must be used each time you run a cycle.
 
How long does it take a cycle to run?       
A cycle will complete within 24 hours.
 
Once a cycle is started, can it be paused to add additional food waste?    
Yes, once the cycle is started, you can pause it during the first 30 minutes to add additional food. Once it is past 30 minutes, it cannot be paused, but the cycle can be cancelled.  If cancelled, the cycle will restart when the Start button is pressed.
 
Why can't food scraps be added after the 30-minute window has passed?               
The device needs enough time to fully process any food added to the cycle.
 
Is the device child-resistant?       
Yes, the controls can be locked out (through the control panel or the mobile app). Additionally, the lid locks when the cycle is active, so children cannot access the mixing compartment. Finally, there is a retention tab on the output bin.
 
Is there anything special required for installation?            
No, simply plug Zera™ Food Recycler into a standard power outlet. It has a 6-foot power cord to provide flexibility of placement.
 
What is the output of Zera™ Food Recycler?         
The output of Zera™ Food Recycler is a ready-to-use, homemade fertilizer that can be used on lawns and gardens. It appears similar to coffee grounds, is dry, and spreads easily.
 
Is the homemade fertilizer the same as compost?              
The homemade fertilizer is not standard compost because it is not created from a traditional outdoor composting process. Instead, it is a ready-to-use homemade fertilizer that, once spread on the lawn and garden, will release nutrients into the soil as it continues to mature.
 
How should the output be used?                
The homemade fertilizer should only be used outdoors. It is recommended to apply the homemade fertilizer on the soil surface, not to exceed ¼-inch thick. Keep the product away from roots and plant stems.
The homemade fertilizer can also be broadcast on grass using a lawn spreader.
 
How should the homemade fertilizer be stored?                
The homemade fertilizer should be stored in an air-tight container in a cool, dry area (i.e., garage, basement, closet) for up to six months.
 
Will the homemade fertilizer attract bugs during storage?             
The homemade fertilizer should not attract insects, especially if stored in an air-tight container as recommended.
 
What is the Zera™ Additive made out of?
The Zera™ Additive is made from coir and baking soda. Coir is made from coconut husk, a rapidly renewable plant-based resource. The Zera™ Additive Pack is made from paper and designed so the entire additive (including bag packaging) can be placed in the Zera™ device.
 
How often do I need to use the Zera™ Additive?                 
One Zera™ Additive Pack is used every time a cycle is run. It is estimated that on average, a U.S. family will run a cycle once a week.
 
How does the Zera™ Air Filter work? What is it made of?                  
The filter within the Zera™ device is made of activated carbon and HEPA layers, designed to continuously filter the air.
 
How long does the Zera™ Air Filter last?  How frequently should it be changed? 
For best performance, the Zera™ Air Filter should be changed every two months.

As there is only one manufacturing process involved in the production of the pots, we have worked closely with our manufacturer on the die cutting tooling design. Having run production trials on a small number of samples, we have gained confidence in the manufacturing process and its ability to produce our desired design. </p><p>With any hardware product, there are risks associated with producing parts at higher volumes, in particular the consistency of the part being produced.

PP is robust meaning it will last a lifetime; unlike traditional plant pots, POTR pots will not break if they are dropped or knocked. The unique mechanical properties of recycled PP also ensure the longevity of the folding origami hinges.</p><h3>Reusability and recyclability</h3><p>POTR Pots are made from 100% recycled materials and are 100% recyclable (should you ever decide to get rid of your pots!). Polypropylene is one of the most commonly recycled plastics in the world meaning that the infrastructure is in place to make recycling this material easier than ever. </p><p>We have purposely chosen a transparent grade of polypropylene due to the fact this makes recycling much more straight forward. A common problem with colored plastics is their post recycling usability. The use of colour limits the application of the plastic for further usage, meaning it is less valuable and less likely to be reused. Using a neutral, transparent grade of plastic means there are multiple posses uses after being recycled.</p><h3>Sustainable materials</h3><p>From the get go, our goal has been to make POTR Pots using 100% recycled materials. We are immensely proud to have achieved this goal by finding suppliers capable of producing recycled materials to the visual and aesthetic standards we desired. </p><p>This has not been an insignificant task! It took several weeks of discussions and multiple sample reviews with several suppliers across Europe to find the right combination of material specification, colour, finish and cost. </p><p>Our recycled polypropylene is being supplied from a materials manufacturer in France and our recycled cotton cord we are purchasing from Bobbiny, based in Poland.</p><h3>Environmentally friendly factories</h3><p>We have purposely partnered with a local manufacturer to ensure we minimise the movement of materials and goods. By staying local we cut our CO2 footprint!</p><h3>Sustainable fulfillment and distribution</h3><p>POTR pots have 100 x less CO2 footprint than clay or concrete plant pots.

Now we need your support to help cover the up front manufacturing costs to bring POTR Pots to life! The benefits to backing us are more than just purchasing a beautiful modern plant pot. You will also be preventing plastic ending up in landfill, as well as supporting a start up with big ambitions to change the way we design and manufacture products to create a greener environment.Check out our media kit if you'd like to share our story!Featured OnRead the BBC article here! POTR Pots Features Flat pack postage POTR pots arrive flat packed in an envelope!The pots will be shipped flat packed so they can be slipped through your letter box. This ensures that POTR has the smallest carbon foot print possible from our manufacturer to your home. Once opened, they are unfolded and laid flat in their net shape.  Easy assemblyPull the draw string to assemble!POTR Pots are super easy (and super satisfying) to assemble using the quick draw cotton cord, transforming the flat pattern into a beautiful multi-faceted pot, capable of holding water in its base.   The cord is tied and tucked inside the pot, before the inner pot stand is assembled into a ring and placed into the pot’s base. The two ends of the cord are then looped under the inner pot stand and inserted into your plant’s soil; using an old pencil is a handy way to do this. Finally the plant can be placed on top of the inner pot stand. Self-wateringAdd water to POTR and watch your plant drink!Simply add water into the pot - if your plant is thirsty it will automatically start drinking the water through the cotton cord. Magic! Water is drawn up through the cotton by the plant using tried and tested wicking technology; this is a common way to water your plants and is particularly useful if you aren’t able to water them yourself on a regular basis! With a semi transparent finish to the pots, its easy to see when your plants are getting thirsty, making it obvious when it’s time to refill. Easy to Clean POTR pots are super easy to clean!If your pot happens to get dirty, it’s super easy to clean. Simply unfold the pot and wipe clean. The recycled polypropylene is chemically resistant and can be washed using cleaning product.  RobustPOTR pot vs ceramic potDon’t worry if you happen to knock your POTR on the floor, unlike a traditional ceramic pot it will take the fall in its stride. Space Efficient POTR are easy to store if you're on the move!If you need to store or move your pot (perhaps you’re moving home!), POTR pots can be folded into their flat pack state making them incredibly space efficient to store. Environmentally friendlyMaking your house plants even greener.POTR Pots makes your house a greener home!Throughout their development we have been determined to make POTR Pots as environmentally friendly as possible, ensuring they fit with our long term ambition of creating a circular economy. With this in mind, all materials used in our pots are made from 100% recycled materials and are 100% recyclable at the end of life (should you ever choose to get rid of your POTR!). All materials have been sourced from within Europe to reduce our carbon footprint when transporting the raw materials, and all manufacturing is carried out in the UK. CO2 footprint of POTR vs concrete potPOTR pots have almost 100 x less CO2 footprint than clay or concrete plant pots. The reason for this is due to POTR pots being capable of fitting in a standard envelope when being delivered, whereas a traditional pot requires a much larger parcel, requiring delivery by van. By using recycled plastic, this also drastically cuts the CO2 impact compared with producing new materials like concrete or clay. It also prevents plastics ending up in landfill sites.Read more about the environmental impact of POTR vs traditional plant pots here. POTR Pots love the environment...they also love this string of hearts! Which size POTR for my house plant ? Pre potted plants come in fairly standard sized pots, and can be classified into one of two categories:Diameter - generally for smaller plant pots (10cm in diameter or less at the rim)Volume - generally this starts at 1 litre and rises to infinity and beyond!To begin our collection, we have designed our pots to fit a range of common house plant pot sizes: Small POTR Pot = 10cm diameter (0.49 litre) house plant pot or lessLarge POTR Pot = 14cm diameter (1.5 litre) house plant pot or lessPOTR Pots have a little bit of give around the top rim so can fit slightly larger sizes than the recommended sizes stated above if necessary.POTR size chart.Having spoken with many plant shop owners, house plant enthusiasts and from our personal experience, we believe the sizes we have designed will cover a large majority of house plants. We intend to release more sizes in the future! Designed and manufactured in the UK  ManufactureTo help minimize our environmental foot print, we have decided to partner with a local manufacturer based here in Bristol. Not only does this mean saving on transport, we have involved our manufacturer from the beginning, helping to eliminate risks and ensure we deliver POTR pots on time and in budget. We have partnered with a company who specialise in die cutting - the main manufacturing process used to create our nets shapes. Not only do they have a skilled and experienced work force, they also design and manufacture the die cutting tools in house. This has allowed us to collaborate on the design of the tool from an early stage, ensuring a space efficient design which minimizes scrap off cuts. We are excited to work together and are proud to manufacture POTR Pots here in Bristol.In house die making at our local manufacturer based in Bristol!MaterialWe selected recycled polypropylene due to its fantastic mechanical properties. PP is robust meaning it will last a lifetime; unlike traditional plant pots, POTR pots will not break if they are dropped or knocked. The unique mechanical properties of recycled PP also ensure the longevity of the folding origami hinges. Multiple POTR Pots are cut from a single sheet of recycled polypropylene.We have chosen Bobbiny recycled cotton cord to use as our draw string and wicking cord. Not only is it 100% recycled, it looks great and works really well at wicking water. We have selected 3 colours of cord to choose from which you will be able to pick in the perk options.  Bobbiny cotton cord colour options (you will have the option to choose your colour when you select a perk).Specifications:0.7mm recycled polypropylene5mm / 9mm recycled cotton cord  POTR Pots outer dimensions.PerksChoose from one of our many perks listed below! You will be able to pick your colour of cotton cord when you choose a perk.Choose from one of our many perks!Cotton cord colours are chosen via the perk options. POTR Pots compliment other house hold objects.Development StoryAs designers, we believe in designing through making, therefore, we have taken a very hands on approach to developing POTR pots right from the beginning. Traditional origami techniques lie at the heart of POTR's design and functionality - we began our journey by creating hundreds of paper origami iterations, experimenting with different forms and fold functionality. We strived to achieve something that would look beautiful in your home while being incredibly functional and intuitive to use. Origami experimentsMini origami pot wrapOrigami pattern makingEfficient prototyping - 1/4 segment pot prototypes!To select a suitable wicking cord material, we took a somewhat scientific approach to determine wicking efficiency. Using a control measure to monitor the rate of evaporation, we created an experiment where each of the cord types raced one another to transfer water from the test tube to the soil in the pot. The winner of this experiment was the Bobbiny cotton cord.From left to right; control measure, Vans shoe lace, Bobbiny cord, candle wick, Kurzwaren cord, Bristol Scrap Store twisted cordMeet the POTR team! Martin (left) and Andy (right)Andy and Martin are experienced product designers with a love of plants and the environment. They have over ten years combined industry experience in bringing products to market at some of the worlds largest consumer product companies.Having studied Product Design Engineering together at the Glasgow School of Art, they have a long history of working as a team on a variety of design projects. POTR Pots combines a passion for simple, playful design with a desire to improve our environment through a thoughtful selection of materials and processes. Pot inspectionConnect with POTRFollow us on Instagram to see more of our development!Milestones and dates We have ensured both our material suppliers and die cutting manufacturers are ready to go!May - June 2019: Research, ideas, prototypes and sourcing suppliers July 2019: Finalise design and test final prototypesAugust 2019: Launching of Kickstarter (Quickstarter) campaign September 2019: End of Kickstarter campaign + beginning of Indiegogo!October 2019: Die cutting production trialsNovember 2019: Bulk order of materialDecember 2019: Indiegogo campaign endsDec 2019 - Feb 2020: Manufacture + deliver perks POTR Pots are ready to go!Budget and Shipping  We’re raising the amount required for a minimum production of 250 units. This covers the cost to make the units as well as the cost for tooling which will allow us to continue making POTR Pots.If you like POTR Pots, you just have to pay a small amount for the shipping which varies depending on your receiving destination, see details when you click the “Back this project” button. We're pretty sure this will be less than the cost of shipping a traditional plant pot!POTR Pots will be posted to anywhere in the world!Risks and challengesWe have purposely partnered with a local manufacturer to minimize the risk of producing POTR Pots. As there is only one manufacturing process involved in the production of the pots, we have worked closely with our manufacturer on the die cutting tooling design. Having run production trials on a small number of samples, we have gained confidence in the manufacturing process and its ability to produce our desired design. With any hardware product, there are risks associated with producing parts at higher volumes, in particular the consistency of the part being produced. This requires fine tuning of the manufacturing process during the set up phase of production. This is something we have discussed in detail with our production partner and will begin this process as soon as we reach funding.With a background in product design and mechanical engineering, and over 10 years combined industry experience, we are very familiar with working with manufacturers both here in the UK and abroad.Most importantly, we are passionate about what we have created and are committed to seeing POTR Pots through to production so that our backers receive them on time and in spec.Environmental commitmentsLong-lasting designWe selected recycled polypropylene due to its fantastic mechanical properties. PP is robust meaning it will last a lifetime; unlike traditional plant pots, POTR pots will not break if they are dropped or knocked. The unique mechanical properties of recycled PP also ensure the longevity of the folding origami hinges.Reusability and recyclabilityPOTR Pots are made from 100% recycled materials and are 100% recyclable (should you ever decide to get rid of your pots!). Polypropylene is one of the most commonly recycled plastics in the world meaning that the infrastructure is in place to make recycling this material easier than ever. We have purposely chosen a transparent grade of polypropylene due to the fact this makes recycling much more straight forward. A common problem with colored plastics is their post recycling usability. The use of colour limits the application of the plastic for further usage, meaning it is less valuable and less likely to be reused. Using a neutral, transparent grade of plastic means there are multiple posses uses after being recycled.Sustainable materialsFrom the get go, our goal has been to make POTR Pots using 100% recycled materials. We are immensely proud to have achieved this goal by finding suppliers capable of producing recycled materials to the visual and aesthetic standards we desired. This has not been an insignificant task! It took several weeks of discussions and multiple sample reviews with several suppliers across Europe to find the right combination of material specification, colour, finish and cost. Our recycled polypropylene is being supplied from a materials manufacturer in France and our recycled cotton cord we are purchasing from Bobbiny, based in Poland.Environmentally friendly factoriesWe have purposely partnered with a local manufacturer to ensure we minimise the movement of materials and goods. By staying local we cut our CO2 footprint!Sustainable fulfillment and distributionPOTR pots have 100 x less CO2 footprint than clay or concrete plant pots. The reason for this is due to the flat packed design of POTR pots which means they are capable of fitting in a standard envelope when being delivered.

<p dir=""ltr""><span>A: That will happen as soon as Google gets the BLE API into Android. We don't want to create special Samsung or HTC or other software. But you are welcome to do so. Sign up for the developer program.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Q: Why are you using pigtail wires and not terminals?</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>A: We hate light switches with terminals. These are exposed metal parts carrying high voltage. And you stick your finger inside.... Also in the light of cost savings, additional metal parts that can influence RF and safety we use pigtails.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Q: The light switch requires NEUTRAL connection as well?</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>A: Yes it does, we are not using leak currents through the lamp that make some LED light blink uncontrolled. Also our green electronics uses a switching power supply for the 5V electronics that has an efficiency of about 80%. Yes, from 165V down to 5V at 80% efficiency. Its actually hard to measure the current on the 110V side when the lights are off. It is only a few hundred micro amps.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Q: What is the maximum lamp power I can control?</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>A: The SmartDimmer is rated 200W, we think this is enough for LED lights. The SmartDimmer is only usable for 120V AC with 60Hz, NOT at 50Hz or at 220V. It will likely not power a 200W incandescent lamp or 200W CFL because the in-rush current will set off the safety features.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Q: What are the safety features of the SmartDimmer?</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>A: First, the SmartDimmer checks for overload. It has a current limiter to 2.5A inside, and never lets more power through. During overload within 1 second it will disable itself. Hardware and firmware work together through a triple fail safe mechanism to build the safest lightswitch in the world. Second the SmartDimmer checks internal temperature. At 60C it will switch off the lamp. Third, lifting off the rocker disables the power to the electronic and to the lights manually.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Q: Can I use the dimmer for lights that are not dimmable, older LED?</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>A: Yes, you can. No problem you just need to switch off the dimming function and also remember that we do not officially test incandescent lights. Hey, they are outlawed, aren't they?? CFLs are also introducing a high in-rush current and the maximum wattage may be lower.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Q: The night light is very bright, can I switch it off completely?</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>A: Yes you can configure the brightness of the night light from 3000mcd down to 10mcd or even switch it off completely.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Q: Can one SmartDimmer talk to another SmartDimmer?</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>A: No, the SmartDimmer is only a slave device. You can connect to it and you can control it, but it does not make connections by itself. Use your cell phone to communicate to multiple SmartDimmers, or get the settings from one and apply it to another.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Q: How many SmartDimmers can I have in my house? Is there a limit communicating with that many wireless devices?</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>A: We don't know of any limit. Communication between the iPhone and the SmartDimmer or the Companion Switch and the SmartDimmer takes only 0.1 seconds, maybe a bit longer if you are too far away.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Q: Does Bluetooth Low Energy communication interfere with my Wifi?</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>A: BLE uses channels for advertising that are out of the Wifi spectrum. Also see: </span><span><a href=""http://zone.ni.com/devzone/cda/pub/p/id/1685"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://zone.ni.com/devzone/cda/pub/p/id/1685</a></span></p>

Would you like to turn off the lights in your bedroom from the bed or change the mood in your living room without having to get up off the couch? Have you had to get out of the car because someone forgot to switch off the lights? 


Would you like to control all the lights in your home with one simple smart phone application?


All you need is to change the light switch. The easy to install AIRcable SmartDimmer™ is the solution for you; a game-changing alternative to expensive home automation equipment. 


The AIRcable SmartDimmer™ from Wireless Cables Inc. is the ONLY in-wall lighting controller that allows to switch lights directly from the iPhone.
 

Built with Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy (BLE) wireless technology the SmartDimmer allows to switch lights directly from the iPhone. No infrastructure, no WiFi or special equipment is required. 
 
The SmartDimmer application allows users to view the status of all lights in the house, the light intensity, the light level, the temperature in the room and the power consumption of each lamp. With the app each light switch is set-up by location, disable or enable dimming function and specify the intensity and function of the night light. 
Additional features such as a timer function as well as the automatic porch light can also be configured during setup.

The AIRcable SmartDimmer™ is easy to install, just as easy as installing a new light fixture. And pairing with the iPhone app is very simple. Optimized for LED lights the combination of iPhone application and the SmartDimmer light switch brings convenience and comfort as well as big savings on material and installation cost. Review our installation guide here.

The most compelling feature is the matched Companion Switch. Running only on batteries, the Companion Switch can be installed anywhere, even in areas that don’t have wiring, such as interior columns. Installation of 2-way, 3-way or even multi-way with the Companion Switch is easy and does not require additional costly wiring, ideal for remodeling. The two AAA batteries last for over 10 years. There is no limit for the number of Companion Switches that control one Smart Dimmer and pairing makes communication secure.

I'm the very proud father of my 14 year old son, was a successful owner/operator of my own screen printing business for 15 years, and recently have been getting by as a landlord and a handyman for hire. I am a diesel and small engine mechanic, a property manager, a carpenter, landscaper, tree worker, lumber sawyer, graphic designer, and avid gardener and chicken herder. By necessity I've taught myself to do whatever needs doing with the attitude that if a thing can be done, then I can do it as well as any. Now I want to re-invent myself as an inventor, and The Firebox is the first one on my list.</p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">    The Firebox is a premade fire in a box, much like the packaged firewood that you see in your local store, except that The Firebox becomes a comfortable log wood fire with just the touch of a match. Clean, </span>efficient<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">, and long lasting, I want to have the Firebox available in stores throughout the nation and then perhaps around the world. If you like the idea of the Firebox, and would like to have it available in your local store, then now is the time to act and make a pledge. I'm running a 45 day campaign to establish a national demand and also a state by state local supplier network capable of filling that demand. It's a tall order, an ambitious attempt, and I'm confident that you will see the value in this campaign and help out as best you can to make the Firebox a reality.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">      A firebox burns for about 3 hours in three stages. The first hour is the burnoff and topper log consumption. Once the toppers have burnt sufficiently, about an hour, they are dropped into the center and the rail logs spread out a bit, creating a coal bed perfect for grilling your food when you put your grill over the rail logs. This cooking section lasts about an hour and then you pull the grill and roll the rails logs up for the final burn off. Here you might want to throw on some more logs, or maybe another Firebox.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">     Because of state laws forbidding transportation of firewood over state lines, and because of the prohibitive costs of fire wood transportation, and not least because I want the Firebox be a means of supporting local rural economic empowerment, the Fireboxes you receive will have been made not only in your state, but most likely in your local region. The good news here is that when you support the Firebox Campaign you are not only supporting a product made in America, but also made in your state and likely your local region, thereby supporting your own local economy. The bad news is that, until we establish a local supplier in your region, I won't be able to fulfill your perk. It's a bit of a risk, but I'm hoping that the idea and the product is good enough that we can blow right through the </span>initial establishment of demand phase and start enlisting suppliers in the regions where the demand is. </p><p>     This campaign is pretty much my job now, and I'll be working non-stop to make it successful. Like you, I am a veritable force of nature once my intention is clear and I know what I want. Trust me. I'll be using all of my obsessive compulsions, all of my fairly vast experience, and call in every one of my favors, real or imaginary, to make this campaign a success and to make sure your pledge is fulfilled. So catch fire, this is happening now. Make a pledge.</p><ul><li><br/></li></ul><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>I'm setting the goal at $25,000 and using flexible funding mainly because it allows both paypal and credit card contributions. What we really need though is your support and then, more than anything, we need to establish a state by state and regional supplier network. The Firebox is a good deal for suppliers, and will enable them to make 2-3 times the money on their woodlots. It likely will take a season or three to really get rolling, and initially they may have to modify their current stock of firewood, but long range it will be well worth it, and any suppliers willing to get on board early will get special attention and consideration when the Firebox really takes hold. This campaign is an opportunity to get in ground floor on something that will enable you to make a good deal more money for your work. The numbers are fair, the product unique though obvious, and your involvement crucial. $1,500 is a considerable chunk, but your investment will be virtually guaranteed as it will come with a local customer base which you would be wise to expand. K.O.A. campgrounds, state and national parks, local retail outlets, get some cards made free at vistaprint and establish more accounts. Once we get rolling I'll turn my attention towards establishing national retail accounts and you will be hard pressed to keep up with the demand, and always making more money. I promise. My job will be to produce and supply the boxes, the point of purchase displays, moderate the forum and web site, and then work on establishing models for extracting fuel wood from forests while making them more healthy and less prone to wildfire.</p><p>     I've set up the perks to cover a range of end user involvement, a reasonable buy in for suppliers, an upper tier for retailers, and ranges for more minor and then angel levels of involvement. In the beginning of this campaign I think the $1-$50 dollar pledges will be the heart of the matter and I urge you to take the chance. It's your initial support that will give the suppliers the confidence to get on board the campaign and thus enable the fulfilling of your pledges.</p><p>     I've included with the 5 and 10 dollar pledge levels, rainbow stickers. These are over 20 years old, vintage original translucent rainbow stickers. This is kind of a flyer, but I've got thousands of these and they are virtually unobtainium.  I remember  fondly the Seventies when these were common on the back windows of cars and held only the meaning of happiness and appreciation of natural beauty and I want these to be the new environmental stickers of the age. So for 5 bucks you get one, and for 10 you get two. They're cool stickers, you can't get them anywhere but here, and you'll be supporting a worthy campaign.</p><p></p><p></p><h3><br/></h3><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>No matter what level of involvement you are able to contribute to, or even if you cannot contribute at all, I urge you all to share the Firebox campaign with your friends. Tell your local store about the campaign and let them know you'd buy Fireboxes if they were available, let your local firewood guy know the opportunity exists. C'mon, it's just the click of a button, the comment at the store, a phone call to your local firewood guy. Tell your friends, they'll like it too, everybody likes a good fire. This is real and it's happening right now.</p></div>","Short SummaryHello there,My name is Michael Appley, and I live off-the-grid deep in the coastal mountains North of Santa Cruz, California.

This cooking section lasts about an hour and then you pull the grill and roll the rails logs up for the final burn off. Here you might want to throw on some more logs, or maybe another Firebox.     Because of state laws forbidding transportation of firewood over state lines, and because of the prohibitive costs of fire wood transportation, and not least because I want the Firebox be a means of supporting local rural economic empowerment, the Fireboxes you receive will have been made not only in your state, but most likely in your local region. The good news here is that when you support the Firebox Campaign you are not only supporting a product made in America, but also made in your state and likely your local region, thereby supporting your own local economy. The bad news is that, until we establish a local supplier in your region, I won't be able to fulfill your perk. It's a bit of a risk, but I'm hoping that the idea and the product is good enough that we can blow right through the initial establishment of demand phase and start enlisting suppliers in the regions where the demand is.      This campaign is pretty much my job now, and I'll be working non-stop to make it successful. Like you, I am a veritable force of nature once my intention is clear and I know what I want. Trust me. I'll be using all of my obsessive compulsions, all of my fairly vast experience, and call in every one of my favors, real or imaginary, to make this campaign a success and to make sure your pledge is fulfilled. So catch fire, this is happening now. Make a pledge.What We Need & What You GetI'm setting the goal at $25,000 and using flexible funding mainly because it allows both paypal and credit card contributions. What we really need though is your support and then, more than anything, we need to establish a state by state and regional supplier network. The Firebox is a good deal for suppliers, and will enable them to make 2-3 times the money on their woodlots. It likely will take a season or three to really get rolling, and initially they may have to modify their current stock of firewood, but long range it will be well worth it, and any suppliers willing to get on board early will get special attention and consideration when the Firebox really takes hold. This campaign is an opportunity to get in ground floor on something that will enable you to make a good deal more money for your work. The numbers are fair, the product unique though obvious, and your involvement crucial. $1,500 is a considerable chunk, but your investment will be virtually guaranteed as it will come with a local customer base which you would be wise to expand. K.O.A. campgrounds, state and national parks, local retail outlets, get some cards made free at vistaprint and establish more accounts. Once we get rolling I'll turn my attention towards establishing national retail accounts and you will be hard pressed to keep up with the demand, and always making more money. I promise. My job will be to produce and supply the boxes, the point of purchase displays, moderate the forum and web site, and then work on establishing models for extracting fuel wood from forests while making them more healthy and less prone to wildfire.     I've set up the perks to cover a range of end user involvement, a reasonable buy in for suppliers, an upper tier for retailers, and ranges for more minor and then angel levels of involvement. In the beginning of this campaign I think the $1-$50 dollar pledges will be the heart of the matter and I urge you to take the chance. It's your initial support that will give the suppliers the confidence to get on board the campaign and thus enable the fulfilling of your pledges.     I've included with the 5 and 10 dollar pledge levels, rainbow stickers. These are over 20 years old, vintage original translucent rainbow stickers. This is kind of a flyer, but I've got thousands of these and they are virtually unobtainium.  I remember  fondly the Seventies when these were common on the back windows of cars and held only the meaning of happiness and appreciation of natural beauty and I want these to be the new environmental stickers of the age. So for 5 bucks you get one, and for 10 you get two. They're cool stickers, you can't get them anywhere but here, and you'll be supporting a worthy campaign.Other Ways You Can HelpNo matter what level of involvement you are able to contribute to, or even if you cannot contribute at all, I urge you all to share the Firebox campaign with your friends. Tell your local store about the campaign and let them know you'd buy Fireboxes if they were available, let your local firewood guy know the opportunity exists. C'mon, it's just the click of a button, the comment at the store, a phone call to your local firewood guy. Tell your friends, they'll like it too, everybody likes a good fire. This is real and it's happening right now.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><strong>Swish: The Perfect Shot</strong></h3>
<p>Swish was created by founder Dean Alms who is equally passionate about tools (a garage full of them) and craft cocktails.  Dean brought together his two passions to create Swish, a unique bar tool for making your favorite craft cocktails.   </p>
<p>In 2020, with most happy hours taking place at home, Swish turns the 5 o'Clock hour into an even better cocktail experience.   Swish will elevate your home bar and showcase your love of craft cocktails.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1605483133/tm0vt9akyc86nfldr87i.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Swish elevates your bar experience</strong></p>
<p>Swish is an innovation on the traditional jigger, with stainless steel construction and thoughtful design to make your pours easy and streamlined.  Hold the swish above your glass, pour in your spirits, then push down on your glass, shaker or mixer and watch as it releases cleanly out of the bottom of the funnel.  When done, place Swish back on the stand and catch tray.   At the end of the evening, both Swish and the catch tray and stand are ready for the dishwasher.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Key Features of the Swish</strong></p>
<p>After a few years of designing and prototyping, Swish is in production.  Pending arrival from manufacturing, we'll start shipping out to our backers. Currently, Swishes are due to arrive into HQ in December.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Primary measurements of 1 oz, 1.5 oz and 3 oz on one side and<br/>Secondary measurements of .5 oz, .75 oz and 2 oz on the other.</strong></p>
<p>The Swish measurements we created were the result of feedback from many backers and their favorite drink recipes.  Primary measurements have an etched in ring around the complete diameter of the Swish. Secondary measurements have a small line on the opposite side of the stainless steel funnel to indicate the level of the pour.</p>

<h3><strong>The Swish Story Continues</strong></h3>
<p>Swish is our first product and we want to make it widely available.  Since we're still in launch phase, crowdfunding helps us get early product feedback and funds the first wave of manufacturing.  It also helps us get the word out there about Swish!  After Indiegogo, we're targeting to make Swish available via retail distributors around the world.   <strong>Now is the time to get your Swish at the best price.</strong></p>
</div><div>
<ul>
<li>We have reached our funding goal on another crowdfunding site.</li>
<li>We believe there is a loyal crowd on Indiegogo who would also enjoy an elevated cocktail experience.  We manufactured additional Swishes to reach the Indiegogo audience.</li>
<li>You can make a pledge for a single Swish, two-pack and a four-pack.</li>

</div></div>","Swish: The Perfect Shot
Swish was created by founder Dean Alms who is equally passionate about tools (a garage full of them) and craft cocktails.  Dean brought together his two passions to create Swish, a unique bar tool for making your favorite craft cocktails.   
In 2020, with most happy hours taking place at home, Swish turns the 5 o'Clock hour into an even better cocktail experience.   Swish will elevate your home bar and showcase your love of craft cocktails.

Swish elevates your bar experience
Swish is an innovation on the traditional jigger, with stainless steel construction and thoughtful design to make your pours easy and streamlined.  Hold the swish above your glass, pour in your spirits, then push down on your glass, shaker or mixer and watch as it releases cleanly out of the bottom of the funnel.  When done, place Swish back on the stand and catch tray.   At the end of the evening, both Swish and the catch tray and stand are ready for the dishwasher.

Key Features of the Swish
After a few years of designing and prototyping, Swish is in production.  Pending arrival from manufacturing, we'll start shipping out to our backers. Currently, Swishes are due to arrive into HQ in December.

Primary measurements of 1 oz, 1.5 oz and 3 oz on one side andSecondary measurements of .5 oz, .75 oz and 2 oz on the other.
The Swish measurements we created were the result of feedback from many backers and their favorite drink recipes.  Primary measurements have an etched in ring around the complete diameter of the Swish. Secondary measurements have a small line on the opposite side of the stainless steel funnel to indicate the level of the pour.
 
The Swish Story Continues
Swish is our first product and we want to make it widely available.  Since we're still in launch phase, crowdfunding helps us get early product feedback and funds the first wave of manufacturing.  It also helps us get the word out there about Swish!  After Indiegogo, we're targeting to make Swish available via retail distributors around the world.   Now is the time to get your Swish at the best price.


We have reached our funding goal on another crowdfunding site.
We believe there is a loyal crowd on Indiegogo who would also enjoy an elevated cocktail experience.  We manufactured additional Swishes to reach the Indiegogo audience.
You can make a pledge for a single Swish, two-pack and a four-pack.
Each Swish comes in a well-designed package ready for gift-giving.

window of her bedroom in the straw house she shared with her grandmother.   The straw house, whose body is composed of firm straw, and whose roof is laid with lighter straw.   She sat up, and she stretched out her arms as the light continued to rise, tickling her eyelids open.   She then went to wash up and returned to her room to don a flannel shirt and a fresh pair of pajama bottoms.   Jilleas descended the staircase where she found her grandmother sitting at the breakfast table with a bowl of fresh berries and crisp wafers.</p><p> </p><p>Jilleas went about preparing one of the cucumber, mayonnaise and dill sandwiches which she so enjoyed.   She sat across from her grandmother, and through the course of the meal her grandmother asked, “Jilleas, would you like to go into town this day and travel to the market?”   Jilleas responded, saying, “Surely.”   And so her grandmother rummaged about and gave Jilleas three thank-you notes: one for the baker, one for the farmer, and one for the dairy farmer.</p><p> </p><p>Once Jilleas finished her meal she called upon a puff of wind, which was really more of a pet.   And the puff of wind took her dishes and dropped them into the silken basin that held the water fairies.   Then Jilleas donned a straw cap and took up her twine bag that makes everything one-tenth its standard size, and she was on her way.</p><p> </p><p>Jilleas traveled north along the clearing upon which she lives in a straw house with her grandmother, along the Sandy Path and then onto the cobblestone of the main township of the Mystical Realm Township and County.   And as she trod the cobblestone she saw the carpenter leaning against the fountain in the center of town with something she had never seen before.   The carpenter, seeing her fascination, waved her over.   As she came closer she could see that there were two wooden discs, with a string wrapped between them, and the other end of the string tied to one of his fingers.   The carpenter opened his hand and she saw the wooden discs go plummeting down as though they were going to crash into the earth, and then stop, and then move upwards once again, returning to the palm of his hand.   And it was as though there were fireworks exploding in the sky overhead.</p><p> </p><p>Jilleas spoke, saying, “What is that that you have there?”   The carpenter responded, saying, “It is something that I fashioned out of spare bits of wood on my workroom floor, and I call it a yo-yo.   You may have heard that what goes up must come down, but when it comes to a yo-yo, what goes down must come up.”   And the carpenter rummaged about in one of his corduroy pockets, and he handed Jilleas a yo-yo of red wood that was bereft of string, wood harvested from the Maroon Forest, which is about a thousand days' journey north of the Mystical Realm Township and County.</p><p> </p><p>It is said that should you touch even so much as a speck of soil upon which the trees of the Maroon Forest grow, that should you press a palm upon any manner of leafy tree, delectable fruit shall spring forth, and should you lower a pail into a well whose flow has dried, it shall come up brimming and bubbling, and a garment of thick wool shall wear as fine linen, and more besides.</p><p> </p><p>Jilleas clasped the yo-yo of red wood, and she began to fantasize, and she fantasized so long that it ascended into her imagination, and she imagined so long that it ascended into a dream, and she dreamt so long that she felt she needed to bring that dream into the world.   And all this took place in the space of a single heartbeat, which is as long as a thousand years in our world.</p><p> </p><p>And Jilleas's dream was this: to let the yo-yo of red wood fall from the tallest tower that was within her reach, that it may nearly touch the ground and then ascend, once more returning to the palm of her hand.</p><p> </p><p>Jilleas then thanked the carpenter in the manner that the townspeople were often wont to do, and she continued on her way to the market, which is along the eastern portion of the main township.   And so she traveled north along the rounded stones, and she soon came to the stand of the baker.   The baker, who was placing warm loaves of crusty bread on a wide hearthstone, whose fragrance emanated throughout the Mystical Realm Township and County.</p><p> </p><p>You may have heard tell that a person cannot live on bread alone.   However, this bread provides all the nourishment for which one could ever wish.</p><p> </p><p>Jilleas procured such a loaf, and offered a thank-you note in exchange.   She continued farther north, and she soon came to the market stand of the farmer, whose wife was something of a free spirit.   She often went on adventures of her own, far and wide.   Though, when she did, buttercup flowers sprung up round about the farmhouse she shared with her husband.   She was currently on such an adventure.</p><p> </p><p>The farmer had brought a bouquet of buttercups to market, and he gave a buttercup to Jilleas, and when she placed it on her tongue, its taste was as a pad of butter, and the texture became as the foam of the sea.</p><p> </p><p>Jilleas curtsied, and he placed a hand upon his breast.   She asked after his wife, and one of the hairs across the top of his head stood, and it formed in the shape of a dove.   Jilleas then procured a jar of mayonnaise, as well as a basket of berries, and a bunch of cucumbers, for which she offered a thank-you note.</p><p> </p><p>She was soon on her way once more, and continued north until she came to the stand of the dairy farmer, who was filling crystal jugs with milk that had a frothing layer of cream extending nearly to the lip.   The dairy farmer flipped one of the bottles whizzing through the air and handed it to Jilleas, and though there did not appear anything between the milk and her hands, the milk did not pour out.   And so Jilleas placed the jug into her twine bag that makes everything one-tenth its standard size, and she offered him a thank-you note.</p><p> </p><p>Jilleas glided south, along the cobblestone of the main township and along the Sandy Path, and soon found herself on the clearing upon which she lives in a straw house with her grandmother.   She had heard tell that there was a queen spider in the Rickety Woods who weaves silk of the finest grade, that was, as far as anyone knew, indestructible.   She wished to procure such a strand for her yo-yo, so she traveled south into the Rickety Woods, round about the bare trees and through the Clean Swamp and the Dry Wood, until she came to a gathering of gemshard trees.   There the Queen Spider rested on a wide web, surrounded by all manner of creatures and critters who were native to that place.   And as Jilleas came upon the gathering of gemshard trees the Queen Spider spoke, saying, “Ah, Jilleas, but it is a glad day that brings you here once more.”</p><p> </p><p>Jilleas, perplexed, responded saying, “But I've not been here ataul.”</p><p> </p><p>The Queen Spider smiled, saying, “Very well then.”   And the creatures and critters surrounding her chattered and clapped.</p><p> </p><p>The Queen Spider continued on, saying, “What then brings you here, young Jilleas?”</p><p> </p><p>Jilleas responded, saying, “I fantasized so long that it ascended into my imagination, and I imagined so long that it ascended into a dream, and I dreamt so long that I felt I needed to bring that dream into the world.   And the dream is this: to let a yo-yo fall from the top of the tallest tower that is within my reach, that it may nearly strike the ground, and then ascend once more, returning to the palm of my hand.</p><p> </p><p>          Would you be willing to provide a strand of the proper length?”</p><p> </p><p>The Queen Spider swayed to and fro, and the many crowns atop her head jostled and clinked.   And the Queen Spider responded, saying, “Surely, though there is something I would ask of you.  There is a chill hugging the floor of the Rickety Woods that that makes my legs cold.   And so I would ask that you bring eight leg warmers to this, my royal court.”</p><p> </p><p>And Jilleas, who had a mind for such matters, could see the path laid out before her, as clear as day.   And she responded, saying, “Surely.”</p><p> </p><p>The Queen Spider spoke farther on, saying, “And you shall know that the strand is of the proper length, when it has emerged on the clearing upon which you live in a straw house with your grandmother.”</p><p> </p><p>And so Jilleas proceeded north, through the Dry Wood, the Clean Swamp and round about the bare trees until she came upon the clearing once more.   And Jilleas sat upon the Resting Log, which is very near the Rickety Woods, that she might enjoy one of the cucumber, mayonnaise and dill sandwiches which she had packed.</p><p> </p><p>The Resting Log, which was once the tallest and most beloved of all the trees in the Mystical Realm Township and County.   Through the seasons the tree was decorated with all manner of streamers and ornaments, and people would find comfort resting their backs upon the soft wood of its curves.   And the tree grew to love the people to such a degree that it wished to be closer to them.   So one day it bent over and it began to grow along the ground, and ever since, it has been referred to as the Resting Log.</p><p> </p><p>Jilleas soon emerged from the Resting Log, and she traveled along the clearing, and along the Sandy Path, and came upon the cobblestone of the main township of the Mystical Realm Township and County.   And she traveled east toward the straw hut of the clothier.   The clothier, who was something of a hermit, but he always kept a boiling pot of water on the stove in the spirit of hospitality.</p><p> </p><p>As Jilleas traveled she came across a mayberry bug traveling in the other direction.   She greeted the mayberry bug, and the mayberry bug did likewise.  And as they passed one another he took one of the mayberry seeds from his burlap sack and tossed it into the air, and it landed snugly into one of the pockets of her pajama bottoms.   It melted into her clothes, and all manner of red vine-like patterns played across the cloth, extending upward to her flannel shirt and even the straw hat which sat upon her head.</p><p> </p><p>Jilleas soon found herself at the hut of the clothier, who, with ruddy demeanor, waved her in.   She sat at the stone table as he prepared two mugs of tea.   The clothier crushed various spices and herbs in his paws, and he poured water from a thick stoneware teapot into mugs, mugs which were fashioned from stone of the Azgul Quarry.</p><p> </p><p>He plucked flowers from a vase and they twirled through the air, landing on the surface of the water.  And the clothier brought the mugs over, and he greeted her in the manner that the townspeople were often wont to do, and he said, “What then brings you here, young Jilleas?”</p><p> </p><p>Jilleas gripped her hands around the mug, which was cool to the touch, as the herbs, spices and flora dissolved completely and utterly into its contents.   She hoisted the mug, and though boiling, the water was soothing to her lips.   And Jilleas spoke, saying, “Well, I fantasized so long that it ascended into my imagination, and I imagined so long that it ascended into a dream, and I dreamt so long that I felt that I needed to bring that dream into the world.</p><p> </p><p>          And the dream is this: to let a yo-yo fall from the top of the tallest tower that is within my reach, that it may nearly touch the ground, and ascend once more, returning to the palm of my hand.”</p><p> </p><p>The clothier ran his fingers through the cloth beard that adorned his face, and responded, saying, “Surely this is a worthwhile aim, though what would you ask of me?”</p><p> </p><p>And Jilleas responded, saying, “Well, the Queen Spider is weaving a strand of the length I require, though she has requested that I procure for her eight leg warmers, for there is a chill that comes upon her legs in the Rickety Woods.”</p><p> </p><p>The clothier spoke, saying, “I shall do as you wish, and I shall go one farther, for I shall knit a stocking cap for your grandmother.   And I shall go one farther beyond that, for I shall knit a pair of stocking leggings for you.</p><p> </p><p>          Though there is something that I would ask of you.   On the dawn of your seventeenth birthday, I would like you to sing a song of your choosing.”</p><p> </p><p>Jilleas stood up from the stone table, and she spun around, and for an instant it was as though she were lifting off the ground.   She responded, saying, “I shall do as you wish, and the song shall in some manner relate to those who tend the land.”</p><p> </p><p>The clothier extended a paw and Jilleas extended a hand, and they clasped.  And as they did so a lightning dewdrop darted across his window, and flashes of light played across the thick red fur on his stout arms.</p><p> </p><p>Jilleas was soon on her way once more, and the clothier stood at his hut waving, even as she traveled beyond the cobblestone of the main township.  She tread lightly upon stones of glass, circling to the west until she came to the northern portion of the Auberjeen Forest, and the residing place of the wizened old tree.   The wizened old tree, who holds lessons for creatures of every size and proportion and children of all ages, lessons on how to be well and how to grow in the promise of long-term happiness, wellbeing and fulfillment.   And as Jilleas came upon the residing place of the wizened old tree, a confetti of leaves burst forth from his hollow, all manner of kaleidoscopic hues as they were falling.</p><p> </p><p>As they came to the ground they meshed and became as one, and Jilleas sat on the confetti of leaves, and found that wherever she placed pressure, they shone even more brilliantly than before.   She somersaulted and she cartwheeled, and she lay upon the soft leaves with her arms outstretched.</p><p> </p><p>The wizened old tree addressed the gathering, and through the course of the afternoon he sent over saplings with a glass of moonberry juice, and those in attendance sipped the nectar as the saplings shuffled about.   Moonberry juice, which soothes every fear, and dispels every ill, and grants wings to the spirit, wings that may one day become wings that the whole world can see, upon which one may ascend to the Sky Kingdom insofar as one wishes.</p><p> </p><p>As she sipped the moonberry juice she cast a luminous shadow in the shape of wings.</p><p> </p><p>Jilleas then traveled farther west through the Auberjeen Forest to the gathering of trees whose branches are as vines, and she was grasped tenderly and tossed into the air, caught by one vine, and another and another and tossed once again, and once more, and she spun, and she stretched her arms as though she were gliding, breathing the strawberry air.   She cupped her hands and sent vibrations coursing through the air, and the trees rumbled.   The vines then picked her up and tossed her once again.</p><p> </p><p>After catching her breath Jilleas traveled northeast to the bare tree stump.   The bare tree stump, which is as large as a city, yet as small as a thimble, a thimble as large as a city.   She sat upon its surface, and as she did so, she caught glimpse of creatures sprouting wings and ascending to the Sky Kingdom.   And as they peered from the Sky Kingdom, the Mystical Realm Township and County appeared as a gem the colors of autumn leaves, burgundy-gold and blazing orange and pomegranate and pale yellow, and that is why it is also called the Autumn Jewel.</p><p> </p><p>Jilleas found that her eyelids were heavy, and she fell asleep as the light of the sun paled, though the light of the sun shines clearly, and is clearly visible in the Mystical Realm, even through the course of evening.   Jilleas awoke during the twinkling of the sands.   Then Jilleas called upon her morningray dove, and gave a packet of light to bring to the sun that read: “Please shine as though it were high noon.”   And the sun did so, and the light was glorious.</p><p> </p><p>Jilleas was soon on her way once more, and she went through the forest, and along the glass stones, and south along the cobblestone of the main township of the Mystical Realm Township and County, and soon came to the hut of the clothier, who gave her eight leg warmers, a stocking cap for her grandmother, and a pair of stocking leggings for Jilleas.   She continued south along the Sandy Path and along the clearing, and as she came upon the clearing, she could see the glimmer of a silken strand just beginning to emerge.   She returned to the straw house in which she lives with her grandmother, and set the goods she had gathered at the marketplace upon the kitchen table.   Steam was arising from one of the silken basins, as licks of flame ran over the dishes, along the contours of the mugs, and along the ridges of the butter knives, and all manner of utensils.</p><p> </p><p>Jilleas slung the twine bag about her shoulder that makes everything one-tenth its standard size, and she walked through the opening carved into the northern wall of the straw house.   And she traveled south along the clearing, and set about gathering up the silken strand as she went round about the bare trees, and through the Clean Swamp, and the Dry Wood, coming upon the residing place of the Queen Spider once more.</p><p> </p><p>Jilleas greeted the Queen Spider in the manner that the townspeople were often wont to do, and she placed the sphere of silk into her twine bag that makes everything one-tenth its standard size.</p><p> </p><p>The Queen Spider spoke, saying, “Ah, Jilleas, but it is a glad day that brings you here once more.”</p><p> </p><p>And the various creatures and critters surrounding the Queen Spider formed a spindly line, and they placed the leg warmers from one to another, fitting each one snugly upon the Queen Spider's legs.   And when the eighth leg warmer was placed, the chill covering the floor of the Rickety Woods vanished, yet there remained an encircling mist around the Queen Spider herself.</p><p> </p><p>And the Queen Spider spoke saying, “Go then, Jilleas, go then and live your crazy dream.”</p><p> </p><p>Jilleas responded, saying, “It is not a crazy dream, for it is a dream that I can bring into the world.”</p><p> </p><p>And the creatures and the critters applauded Jilleas, and the glimmer that shone from deep within the gem shards of the gemshard trees came nearer to the surface, and the light of the gems set in the many crowns atop the Queen Spider's head pulsed.</p><p> </p><p>The Queen Spider then tipped her head, and one of her many crowns tumbled through the air, and along the ground, and it struck a pebble, leaping through the air, as it landed into the twine bag upon Jilleas's shoulder.   And the creatures and the critters of the Rickety Woods circled the wide web upon which the Queen Spider rested, and her cheeks became the color of rose.</p><p> </p><p>Jilleas spun about, thanking the Queen Spider.   She traveled north once more through the Dry Wood and the Clean Swamp and round about the bare trees, and once she had come upon the clearing she tread the southern portion of the Auberjeen Forest, which wraps around the western edge of the Mystical Realm Township and County.   She soon found herself standing before the cast-iron spire of the Felleye Tower.   The Felleye Tower, which is so named, for it is said that a mighty creature once lumbered 'neath its arches.</p><p> </p><p>And so Jilleas climbed the Felleye Tower, past the bark of the trees of the Auberjeen Forest, through the canopy of the trees, through the sky, through the clouds, through the azure blue gradient and the billowing white cloud of smoke, until she came upon the landing.   The landing, which is nearly within reach of the Sky Kingdom.   And she tied one end of the silken strand to one of her fingers, and the other end to the yo-yo of red wood, and she let it go plummeting down.   And it went through the billowing white cloud of smoke and the azure blue gradient and the clouds and the sky and the canopy, past the bark of the trees of the Auberjeen Forest, and it came to an abrupt halt, a rest.</p><p> </p><p>And it was as though Jilleas's heart had become arrested.</p><p> </p><p>Then, an earthworm emerged from the soil, whose head is its tail and whose tail is its head.   And the earthworm arched as it slithered over to the yo-yo: slinkity-slink, slinkity-slink.   The pinkity-slink stood, and it nudged the yo-yo, and the yo-yo went soaring upwards as fast as though it were falling, past the bark of the trees of the Auberjeen Forest and through the canopy, through the sky and through the clouds, through the azure blue gradient, through the billowing white cloud of smoke as it began to slow, and slow, and slow.</p><p> </p><p>And the spinning wooden discs returned to her outstretched palm, and she closed her fingers around the yo-yo.</p><p> </p><p>Jilleas sighed, and the sigh bounded along the air, and it caught the wind, and it became the wind, and it traveled around the world, until it returned, tousling the hair on the back of her head.   And her grandmother, upon whose visage was a somewhat dour expression, well, her lips curled upwards around the edges, though she was unsure as to why.   And the fireworks that Jilleas had seen when the yo-yo had first met her eyes became real fireworks, fireworks that the whole world could see.</p><p> </p><p>And Jilleas could see that all is peace,</p><p> </p><p>All is well.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><br/></p><p>The beginning.</p></div>","Hello, I've put up this page because I'd like to raise $500-$1000 to be set

Jilleas then thanked the carpenter in the manner that the townspeople were often wont to do, and she continued on her way to the market, which is along the eastern portion of the main township.   And so she traveled north along the rounded stones, and she soon came to the stand of the baker.   The baker, who was placing warm loaves of crusty bread on a wide hearthstone, whose fragrance emanated throughout the Mystical Realm Township and County. You may have heard tell that a person cannot live on bread alone.   However, this bread provides all the nourishment for which one could ever wish. Jilleas procured such a loaf, and offered a thank-you note in exchange.   She continued farther north, and she soon came to the market stand of the farmer, whose wife was something of a free spirit.   She often went on adventures of her own, far and wide.   Though, when she did, buttercup flowers sprung up round about the farmhouse she shared with her husband.   She was currently on such an adventure. The farmer had brought a bouquet of buttercups to market, and he gave a buttercup to Jilleas, and when she placed it on her tongue, its taste was as a pad of butter, and the texture became as the foam of the sea. Jilleas curtsied, and he placed a hand upon his breast.   She asked after his wife, and one of the hairs across the top of his head stood, and it formed in the shape of a dove.   Jilleas then procured a jar of mayonnaise, as well as a basket of berries, and a bunch of cucumbers, for which she offered a thank-you note. She was soon on her way once more, and continued north until she came to the stand of the dairy farmer, who was filling crystal jugs with milk that had a frothing layer of cream extending nearly to the lip.   The dairy farmer flipped one of the bottles whizzing through the air and handed it to Jilleas, and though there did not appear anything between the milk and her hands, the milk did not pour out.   And so Jilleas placed the jug into her twine bag that makes everything one-tenth its standard size, and she offered him a thank-you note. Jilleas glided south, along the cobblestone of the main township and along the Sandy Path, and soon found herself on the clearing upon which she lives in a straw house with her grandmother.   She had heard tell that there was a queen spider in the Rickety Woods who weaves silk of the finest grade, that was, as far as anyone knew, indestructible.   She wished to procure such a strand for her yo-yo, so she traveled south into the Rickety Woods, round about the bare trees and through the Clean Swamp and the Dry Wood, until she came to a gathering of gemshard trees.   There the Queen Spider rested on a wide web, surrounded by all manner of creatures and critters who were native to that place.   And as Jilleas came upon the gathering of gemshard trees the Queen Spider spoke, saying, “Ah, Jilleas, but it is a glad day that brings you here once more.” Jilleas, perplexed, responded saying, “But I've not been here ataul.” The Queen Spider smiled, saying, “Very well then.”   And the creatures and critters surrounding her chattered and clapped. The Queen Spider continued on, saying, “What then brings you here, young Jilleas?” Jilleas responded, saying, “I fantasized so long that it ascended into my imagination, and I imagined so long that it ascended into a dream, and I dreamt so long that I felt I needed to bring that dream into the world.   And the dream is this: to let a yo-yo fall from the top of the tallest tower that is within my reach, that it may nearly strike the ground, and then ascend once more, returning to the palm of my hand.           Would you be willing to provide a strand of the proper length?” The Queen Spider swayed to and fro, and the many crowns atop her head jostled and clinked.   And the Queen Spider responded, saying, “Surely, though there is something I would ask of you.  There is a chill hugging the floor of the Rickety Woods that that makes my legs cold.   And so I would ask that you bring eight leg warmers to this, my royal court.” And Jilleas, who had a mind for such matters, could see the path laid out before her, as clear as day.   And she responded, saying, “Surely.” The Queen Spider spoke farther on, saying, “And you shall know that the strand is of the proper length, when it has emerged on the clearing upon which you live in a straw house with your grandmother.” And so Jilleas proceeded north, through the Dry Wood, the Clean Swamp and round about the bare trees until she came upon the clearing once more.   And Jilleas sat upon the Resting Log, which is very near the Rickety Woods, that she might enjoy one of the cucumber, mayonnaise and dill sandwiches which she had packed. The Resting Log, which was once the tallest and most beloved of all the trees in the Mystical Realm Township and County.   Through the seasons the tree was decorated with all manner of streamers and ornaments, and people would find comfort resting their backs upon the soft wood of its curves.   And the tree grew to love the people to such a degree that it wished to be closer to them.   So one day it bent over and it began to grow along the ground, and ever since, it has been referred to as the Resting Log. Jilleas soon emerged from the Resting Log, and she traveled along the clearing, and along the Sandy Path, and came upon the cobblestone of the main township of the Mystical Realm Township and County.   And she traveled east toward the straw hut of the clothier.   The clothier, who was something of a hermit, but he always kept a boiling pot of water on the stove in the spirit of hospitality. As Jilleas traveled she came across a mayberry bug traveling in the other direction.   She greeted the mayberry bug, and the mayberry bug did likewise.  And as they passed one another he took one of the mayberry seeds from his burlap sack and tossed it into the air, and it landed snugly into one of the pockets of her pajama bottoms.   It melted into her clothes, and all manner of red vine-like patterns played across the cloth, extending upward to her flannel shirt and even the straw hat which sat upon her head. Jilleas soon found herself at the hut of the clothier, who, with ruddy demeanor, waved her in.   She sat at the stone table as he prepared two mugs of tea.   The clothier crushed various spices and herbs in his paws, and he poured water from a thick stoneware teapot into mugs, mugs which were fashioned from stone of the Azgul Quarry. He plucked flowers from a vase and they twirled through the air, landing on the surface of the water.  And the clothier brought the mugs over, and he greeted her in the manner that the townspeople were often wont to do, and he said, “What then brings you here, young Jilleas?” Jilleas gripped her hands around the mug, which was cool to the touch, as the herbs, spices and flora dissolved completely and utterly into its contents.   She hoisted the mug, and though boiling, the water was soothing to her lips.   And Jilleas spoke, saying, “Well, I fantasized so long that it ascended into my imagination, and I imagined so long that it ascended into a dream, and I dreamt so long that I felt that I needed to bring that dream into the world.           And the dream is this: to let a yo-yo fall from the top of the tallest tower that is within my reach, that it may nearly touch the ground, and ascend once more, returning to the palm of my hand.” The clothier ran his fingers through the cloth beard that adorned his face, and responded, saying, “Surely this is a worthwhile aim, though what would you ask of me?” And Jilleas responded, saying, “Well, the Queen Spider is weaving a strand of the length I require, though she has requested that I procure for her eight leg warmers, for there is a chill that comes upon her legs in the Rickety Woods.” The clothier spoke, saying, “I shall do as you wish, and I shall go one farther, for I shall knit a stocking cap for your grandmother.   And I shall go one farther beyond that, for I shall knit a pair of stocking leggings for you.           Though there is something that I would ask of you.   On the dawn of your seventeenth birthday, I would like you to sing a song of your choosing.” Jilleas stood up from the stone table, and she spun around, and for an instant it was as though she were lifting off the ground.   She responded, saying, “I shall do as you wish, and the song shall in some manner relate to those who tend the land.” The clothier extended a paw and Jilleas extended a hand, and they clasped.  And as they did so a lightning dewdrop darted across his window, and flashes of light played across the thick red fur on his stout arms. Jilleas was soon on her way once more, and the clothier stood at his hut waving, even as she traveled beyond the cobblestone of the main township.  She tread lightly upon stones of glass, circling to the west until she came to the northern portion of the Auberjeen Forest, and the residing place of the wizened old tree.   The wizened old tree, who holds lessons for creatures of every size and proportion and children of all ages, lessons on how to be well and how to grow in the promise of long-term happiness, wellbeing and fulfillment.   And as Jilleas came upon the residing place of the wizened old tree, a confetti of leaves burst forth from his hollow, all manner of kaleidoscopic hues as they were falling. As they came to the ground they meshed and became as one, and Jilleas sat on the confetti of leaves, and found that wherever she placed pressure, they shone even more brilliantly than before.   She somersaulted and she cartwheeled, and she lay upon the soft leaves with her arms outstretched. The wizened old tree addressed the gathering, and through the course of the afternoon he sent over saplings with a glass of moonberry juice, and those in attendance sipped the nectar as the saplings shuffled about.   Moonberry juice, which soothes every fear, and dispels every ill, and grants wings to the spirit, wings that may one day become wings that the whole world can see, upon which one may ascend to the Sky Kingdom insofar as one wishes. As she sipped the moonberry juice she cast a luminous shadow in the shape of wings. Jilleas then traveled farther west through the Auberjeen Forest to the gathering of trees whose branches are as vines, and she was grasped tenderly and tossed into the air, caught by one vine, and another and another and tossed once again, and once more, and she spun, and she stretched her arms as though she were gliding, breathing the strawberry air.   She cupped her hands and sent vibrations coursing through the air, and the trees rumbled.   The vines then picked her up and tossed her once again. After catching her breath Jilleas traveled northeast to the bare tree stump.   The bare tree stump, which is as large as a city, yet as small as a thimble, a thimble as large as a city.   She sat upon its surface, and as she did so, she caught glimpse of creatures sprouting wings and ascending to the Sky Kingdom.   And as they peered from the Sky Kingdom, the Mystical Realm Township and County appeared as a gem the colors of autumn leaves, burgundy-gold and blazing orange and pomegranate and pale yellow, and that is why it is also called the Autumn Jewel. Jilleas found that her eyelids were heavy, and she fell asleep as the light of the sun paled, though the light of the sun shines clearly, and is clearly visible in the Mystical Realm, even through the course of evening.   Jilleas awoke during the twinkling of the sands.   Then Jilleas called upon her morningray dove, and gave a packet of light to bring to the sun that read: “Please shine as though it were high noon.”   And the sun did so, and the light was glorious. Jilleas was soon on her way once more, and she went through the forest, and along the glass stones, and south along the cobblestone of the main township of the Mystical Realm Township and County, and soon came to the hut of the clothier, who gave her eight leg warmers, a stocking cap for her grandmother, and a pair of stocking leggings for Jilleas.   She continued south along the Sandy Path and along the clearing, and as she came upon the clearing, she could see the glimmer of a silken strand just beginning to emerge.   She returned to the straw house in which she lives with her grandmother, and set the goods she had gathered at the marketplace upon the kitchen table.   Steam was arising from one of the silken basins, as licks of flame ran over the dishes, along the contours of the mugs, and along the ridges of the butter knives, and all manner of utensils. Jilleas slung the twine bag about her shoulder that makes everything one-tenth its standard size, and she walked through the opening carved into the northern wall of the straw house.   And she traveled south along the clearing, and set about gathering up the silken strand as she went round about the bare trees, and through the Clean Swamp, and the Dry Wood, coming upon the residing place of the Queen Spider once more. Jilleas greeted the Queen Spider in the manner that the townspeople were often wont to do, and she placed the sphere of silk into her twine bag that makes everything one-tenth its standard size. The Queen Spider spoke, saying, “Ah, Jilleas, but it is a glad day that brings you here once more.” And the various creatures and critters surrounding the Queen Spider formed a spindly line, and they placed the leg warmers from one to another, fitting each one snugly upon the Queen Spider's legs.   And when the eighth leg warmer was placed, the chill covering the floor of the Rickety Woods vanished, yet there remained an encircling mist around the Queen Spider herself. And the Queen Spider spoke saying, “Go then, Jilleas, go then and live your crazy dream.” Jilleas responded, saying, “It is not a crazy dream, for it is a dream that I can bring into the world.” And the creatures and the critters applauded Jilleas, and the glimmer that shone from deep within the gem shards of the gemshard trees came nearer to the surface, and the light of the gems set in the many crowns atop the Queen Spider's head pulsed. The Queen Spider then tipped her head, and one of her many crowns tumbled through the air, and along the ground, and it struck a pebble, leaping through the air, as it landed into the twine bag upon Jilleas's shoulder.   And the creatures and the critters of the Rickety Woods circled the wide web upon which the Queen Spider rested, and her cheeks became the color of rose. Jilleas spun about, thanking the Queen Spider.   She traveled north once more through the Dry Wood and the Clean Swamp and round about the bare trees, and once she had come upon the clearing she tread the southern portion of the Auberjeen Forest, which wraps around the western edge of the Mystical Realm Township and County.   She soon found herself standing before the cast-iron spire of the Felleye Tower.   The Felleye Tower, which is so named, for it is said that a mighty creature once lumbered 'neath its arches. And so Jilleas climbed the Felleye Tower, past the bark of the trees of the Auberjeen Forest, through the canopy of the trees, through the sky, through the clouds, through the azure blue gradient and the billowing white cloud of smoke, until she came upon the landing.   The landing, which is nearly within reach of the Sky Kingdom.   And she tied one end of the silken strand to one of her fingers, and the other end to the yo-yo of red wood, and she let it go plummeting down.   And it went through the billowing white cloud of smoke and the azure blue gradient and the clouds and the sky and the canopy, past the bark of the trees of the Auberjeen Forest, and it came to an abrupt halt, a rest. And it was as though Jilleas's heart had become arrested. Then, an earthworm emerged from the soil, whose head is its tail and whose tail is its head.   And the earthworm arched as it slithered over to the yo-yo: slinkity-slink, slinkity-slink.   The pinkity-slink stood, and it nudged the yo-yo, and the yo-yo went soaring upwards as fast as though it were falling, past the bark of the trees of the Auberjeen Forest and through the canopy, through the sky and through the clouds, through the azure blue gradient, through the billowing white cloud of smoke as it began to slow, and slow, and slow. And the spinning wooden discs returned to her outstretched palm, and she closed her fingers around the yo-yo. Jilleas sighed, and the sigh bounded along the air, and it caught the wind, and it became the wind, and it traveled around the world, until it returned, tousling the hair on the back of her head.   And her grandmother, upon whose visage was a somewhat dour expression, well, her lips curled upwards around the edges, though she was unsure as to why.   And the fireworks that Jilleas had seen when the yo-yo had first met her eyes became real fireworks, fireworks that the whole world could see. And Jilleas could see that all is peace, All is well.   The beginning.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

Dedicated to inspiring creative living in personal spaces, our small team of 9 has been working towards bringing you premium products that embrace style and function for today's consumer.
<p>We've recently implemented a Design Partnership program that works with talented designers like Ben Uyeda to constantly bring our customers innovative products while supporting the design community.</p>
<p>The UX4 is our first crowdfunded project, but we hope to bring products like the UX4 to the crowdfunding community 4 or 5 times a year with your support.</p>
<p>When we first spoke with Ben about SWENYO and our philosophy, it was immediately apparent that we were on the same page. Why does modern furniture have to either be expensive or low-quality? The answer is, it doesn't. Ben already had the idea for the UX4, but teaming up to bring this product to the lovely people of Indiegogo made it a reality.</p>
<p>We want to give a big thanks to all of our supporters and backers who stand behind good design, quality products, and cool people doing cool things :) Stay tuned for campaign updates with extra tips, design ideas, and our progress! </p>

The UX4 Bracket Kit includes 4 steel, powder coated (or raw steel) brackets, the hardware, and guidelines for assembly. Screw any standard 2x4 into each bracket, choose a good surface, attach your bracketed legs with the screws, and you have yourself a table!Below you'll find a quick guide to a couple common furniture pieces and the needed 2x4 leg lengths to build them. Keep in mind, the recommended leg lengths add a couple of inches to accommodate angled 2x4 legs.Any contribution you can make is greatly appreciated! With your support, we can bring this design to the people as a SWENYO product, while keeping costs low. Whether you want a simple or complex project, The UX4 Kit lets you create your own customized piece of modern furniture at an affordable price. 

SWENYO is a new online home goods brand and retailer located in sunny Encinitas, CA. Dedicated to inspiring creative living in personal spaces, our small team of 9 has been working towards bringing you premium products that embrace style and function for today's consumer.
We've recently implemented a Design Partnership program that works with talented designers like Ben Uyeda to constantly bring our customers innovative products while supporting the design community.
The UX4 is our first crowdfunded project, but we hope to bring products like the UX4 to the crowdfunding community 4 or 5 times a year with your support.
When we first spoke with Ben about SWENYO and our philosophy, it was immediately apparent that we were on the same page. Why does modern furniture have to either be expensive or low-quality? The answer is, it doesn't. Ben already had the idea for the UX4, but teaming up to bring this product to the lovely people of Indiegogo made it a reality.
We want to give a big thanks to all of our supporters and backers who stand behind good design, quality products, and cool people doing cool things :) Stay tuned for campaign updates with extra tips, design ideas, and our progress!

Risks and Challenges
SWENYO has already been working with a high quality manufacturer and there could be changes in commodity prices but we're very confident we can deliver the UX4. We've already built 3-4 versions of prototypes, tested development, and are ready for the production run.
SWENYO has been designing and manufacturing home goods products for two years so your money is in good hands!",24.0,0,"2 Campaigns

To realize our vision we undertook an interdisciplinary approach involving product design, user experience design, as well as landscape and architecture design. We actively sought to answer essential questions: What is a planter now vs. what a planter could be? How can a planter change our appreciation of plants and our behaviors toward them? How could a planter turn a plant into something more consequential? These questions are not trivial. They provided a starting point for rethinking the role of both plant and planter in our everyday lives.</p><p>In designing a prototype, we made hundreds of sketches and produced 32 different design iterations of Livi. Eventually, we 3D printed several dozen prototypes and carefully painted them to study color variations.</p><p>Since we believe that great design is a shared, participatory experience between designers and users, we approached this human-centered design strategy very seriously. We invited many different groups of people to engage with our prototypes for several weeks, and encouraged them to provide feedback throughout the process. Although the end-goal is the design of a great product, we are just as interested in enhancing people's lives at home or in the workplace by engaging with greenery through Livi.</p><p>Livi can hold a variety of plants and has a capacity of up to 10oz (17.5 cubicinches, 275cc), which allows for planting a variety of greenery and herbs, or displaying your favorite flowers. You can also simply insert a small planter pot directly in Livi. </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1465974668/livi-KS-section_diagrams_nskor9.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>Manufacturing</b></p><p>We are thrilled with all the possibilities Livi can offer. Livi’s design involves complex curvature forms and geometry. We spent literally hundreds of hours consulting with designers, technicians, and manufacturers from North America, Europe, and Asia for the smoothest and best manufacturing results. We sent out digital models and 3D printed prototypes to manufacturers, and either met them face-to-face or communicated with them to review the entire process. The manufacturing process involves an injection molding technique that uses a resin (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) that is 100% recyclable. The process includes:</p><p>•<span>  </span>Mold design </p><p>•<span>  </span>Mold tooling </p><p>•<span>  </span>Sample production </p><p>•<span>  </span>Production Run </p><p>•<span>  </span> Assembly (attaching microsuction pads on livi’s palms).</p><p>•<span>  </span>After a great deal of research, we are excited to share that we have partnered with a great manufacturer, and are passionately waiting to start the process!</p><p><b>Microscution Pads:</b></p><p>Livi's palms are made of micro-suction pads using an innovative nanotechnology process developed in Japan.</p><p>Livi sticks to smooth, even, clean, and dry surface. Micro-suction pads function like suction cups, but at the microscopic level. Micro-suction tapes have hundreds of microscopic air pockets that create a vacuum once they are pressed against smooth surfaces, creating a bond. That’s why it’s so important to clean the surface prior to affixing Livi so that dirt/dust particles do not affect the micro-suction pads. When removing Livi from surfaces, please do so gently since rapid removal may result in tearing and damaging the micro-suction pads—thus weakening the bonding power of Livi’s pads. Do not use Livi in areas that are wet and too humid (bathrooms or sauna) because microscopic water particles will lower or remove its adsorption force. In case you want to stick Livi to a new surface, we do recommend cleaning both the new surface and the pads by wiping the micro-suction off with a damp cloth to remove the dust and let it completely dry. Once dry, the suction power will be restored. If the micro-suction pads are not well maintained (get dirty, absorb dust particles, or tear due to rapid removal from surfaces), it loses its function and won't re-adhere to surfaces properly and there is a chance that Livi will drop from the surface. We have tested micro-suction pads on our own prototypes for several months and those that are well-maintained are functioning properly. We have not tested the micro-suction tape beyond 12 months and have relied on the the manufacturer/supplier specifications. Our supply of micro-suction pads come with a protection film, and since we won't remove the film we will not test them individually, so we don't guarantee any possible malfunction resulting from micro-suction pads.</p><p><b>Responsible Manufacturing: </b></p><p> Livi is committed to social and environmental sustainability. We are pleased to say that the entire manufacturing process is socially responsible, resulting in a resin material that is also fully recyclable!</p><p> </p><h3>About Us:</h3><p>The Livi team is dedicated to developing new ways in which we as humans can incorporate plants and ecological systems into the built environment.

 A New Experience 
 Livi is a vivid creature that reimagines the way we relate to plants! We believe that by reimagining the most ordinary everyday products in innovative ways, we can create treasured experiences that enhance our environment and impact our well-being. That is why we created Livi (patent pending)—a colorful creature that reimagines the way we experience and relate to our plants. Livi is a versatile portable planter for virtually any vertical surface. Livi does not require any assembly and is ready to attach to a window (or other surface) in your home or office with a gentle push. Inspired by nature, Livi’s micro-suction palms are made of an innovative nanotechnology material that is able to bond with smooth surfaces repeatedly, including windows!     Press:  You visit our PR page at here Why Livi? We believe that many people view plants as static decorations, relegated to the corner of a room, table, or window ledge. We want to change this perception. By reimagining the commonplace planter as a playful animated creature, we sought to create a more engaging and pleasurable experience with plants and flowers. Although Livi may be small and compact, it can have a big impact by enhancing the way we live, work, and play.     Bring Outside In: Livi makes it possible to grow our favorite plants virtually everywhere. No more worries about whether indoor light is too dim or your home lacks window ledges for plants. Simply stick Livi to your window and bring the natural world inside!How does it work? •  Remove the protective film from Livi’s palms (micro-suction)•  Simply place a size-appropriate planter pot inside Livi. (Alternatively, you can fill Livi with nutrient-rich soil and then directly plant your flowers, herbs or greenery within.)•  Stick Livi to your window. Enjoy adorning your windows and turning them into a beautiful vertical garden. Colors + Stretch Goals:•  The Campaign Starts with Medow Colors (Jasmine, Sunflower, Lime, Aqua)•  Stretch Goal 1 will unlock two more colors (Orange, Lavender)•  Stretch Goal 2 will unlock addition two colors (Serenity Blue, Rose)    Design Process: We aspired to design a new experience with plants. To realize our vision we undertook an interdisciplinary approach involving product design, user experience design, as well as landscape and architecture design. We actively sought to answer essential questions: What is a planter now vs. what a planter could be? How can a planter change our appreciation of plants and our behaviors toward them? How could a planter turn a plant into something more consequential? These questions are not trivial. They provided a starting point for rethinking the role of both plant and planter in our everyday lives.In designing a prototype, we made hundreds of sketches and produced 32 different design iterations of Livi. Eventually, we 3D printed several dozen prototypes and carefully painted them to study color variations.Since we believe that great design is a shared, participatory experience between designers and users, we approached this human-centered design strategy very seriously. We invited many different groups of people to engage with our prototypes for several weeks, and encouraged them to provide feedback throughout the process. Although the end-goal is the design of a great product, we are just as interested in enhancing people's lives at home or in the workplace by engaging with greenery through Livi.Livi can hold a variety of plants and has a capacity of up to 10oz (17.5 cubicinches, 275cc), which allows for planting a variety of greenery and herbs, or displaying your favorite flowers. You can also simply insert a small planter pot directly in Livi.  ManufacturingWe are thrilled with all the possibilities Livi can offer. Livi’s design involves complex curvature forms and geometry. We spent literally hundreds of hours consulting with designers, technicians, and manufacturers from North America, Europe, and Asia for the smoothest and best manufacturing results. We sent out digital models and 3D printed prototypes to manufacturers, and either met them face-to-face or communicated with them to review the entire process. The manufacturing process involves an injection molding technique that uses a resin (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) that is 100% recyclable. The process includes:•  Mold design •  Mold tooling •  Sample production •  Production Run •   Assembly (attaching microsuction pads on livi’s palms).•  After a great deal of research, we are excited to share that we have partnered with a great manufacturer, and are passionately waiting to start the process!Microscution Pads:Livi's palms are made of micro-suction pads using an innovative nanotechnology process developed in Japan.Livi sticks to smooth, even, clean, and dry surface. Micro-suction pads function like suction cups, but at the microscopic level. Micro-suction tapes have hundreds of microscopic air pockets that create a vacuum once they are pressed against smooth surfaces, creating a bond. That’s why it’s so important to clean the surface prior to affixing Livi so that dirt/dust particles do not affect the micro-suction pads. When removing Livi from surfaces, please do so gently since rapid removal may result in tearing and damaging the micro-suction pads—thus weakening the bonding power of Livi’s pads. Do not use Livi in areas that are wet and too humid (bathrooms or sauna) because microscopic water particles will lower or remove its adsorption force. In case you want to stick Livi to a new surface, we do recommend cleaning both the new surface and the pads by wiping the micro-suction off with a damp cloth to remove the dust and let it completely dry. Once dry, the suction power will be restored. If the micro-suction pads are not well maintained (get dirty, absorb dust particles, or tear due to rapid removal from surfaces), it loses its function and won't re-adhere to surfaces properly and there is a chance that Livi will drop from the surface. We have tested micro-suction pads on our own prototypes for several months and those that are well-maintained are functioning properly. We have not tested the micro-suction tape beyond 12 months and have relied on the the manufacturer/supplier specifications. Our supply of micro-suction pads come with a protection film, and since we won't remove the film we will not test them individually, so we don't guarantee any possible malfunction resulting from micro-suction pads.Responsible Manufacturing:  Livi is committed to social and environmental sustainability. We are pleased to say that the entire manufacturing process is socially responsible, resulting in a resin material that is also fully recyclable! About Us:The Livi team is dedicated to developing new ways in which we as humans can incorporate plants and ecological systems into the built environment. Livi is our pet project, which emerged from an afternoon brain-storming session and made us all excited.  We share passion for our new pet project, Livi.  We aim to reimagine the way the humans interact with the greenery and plants in the built environment and cities.  Hooman Koliji Hooman is an architect, landscape designer, and educator. He is passionate about exploring imaginative solutions for critical problems. His work on Ecological Design Thinking has yielded several innovative design research projects.Parsa Shirazi Parsa is a designer and experienced architect. After years of practicing architecture, graphic design, and teaching, Parsa pursued User Experience Design (UX) and Interaction Design and poured all of his experience and passion into the user experience.Yildirim Yazgaranikan  Yildirim is a designer with a background in architecture, product design, and technology. He is passionate about finding intelligent ways to solve complex problems.Mandana ParvinianMandana is a landscape designer and an architect based in San Francisco Bay Area. She is interested in creating meaningful and well-crafted design.Risks and challengesIf we are funded successfully, we expect a smooth production process. It must be said, however, that manufacturing in large scale has the potential to present some inherent challenges. A critical point in our process is the Design for Mold (DFM) stage, which sometimes requires minor design modifications to ensure manufacturability and quality production. In fact, we made several design revisions to our initial production run to address ""undercut"" areas and the “side pulling action” of the mold during the injection molding process.

Our manufacturing partner solved this issue by using specialized resins with additives, as well as increasing the cycle time to eliminate that risk. With respect to this issue, we do not foresee any major problems ahead; we are also confident that any minor issues that might arise during the manufacturing process can be easily mitigated.Color mixing in plastic injection mold is a challenge, but always achievable. Manufacturers simply mix color pigments to achieve the desired hue. Our manufacturing partner will use the Pantone color code to match production colors to our design specifications. Prior to full production we will receive several sample color runs to review and approve, thereby ensuring that the final colors will match to color selection.We feel confident in stating that we have minimized possible risks by consulting with manufacturing experts and our manufacturing partner through numerous back-and-forth exchanges throughout the design and manufacturing process.In summary, we feel that we are well on our way to the beginning of an exciting adventure with Livi!For more information please visit Livi's page at http://livi.creodes.com",16.0,0,"1 Campaign

The Eva team combined the power of technology with the sensibility of conservation to create a concept with the potential to make a significant impact on water usage with these principles in mind:</p> <ul><li><h4>Water Crisis</h4></li></ul>
<p>Countries all over the world are currently in some of the worst drought conditions in history, experiencing ""exceptional"" drought conditions - the harshest on a five-level scale. Consequences of this high level of drought include: exceptional and widespread crop/pasture losses and shortages of water in reservoirs, streams, and wells, creating water emergencies. According to the International Water Management Institute, the world can expect more extreme weather and rising numbers in the world's population, which will dramatically increase a demand for water. </p>
<ul><li><h4>Smart Technology</h4></li></ul>
<p>Equipped with a specialized free mobile app, Eva gives users a more personalized way to shower. Through bluetooth technology, the Eva app is able to provide comprehensive shower statistics that allow you to track your water conservation efforts and compare results with the rest of the Eva community. An advanced algorithm also allows the shower’s sensor system to determine the amount of water used during a shower, while maintaining a high quality experience.</p>
<ul><li><h4>Shower Experience</h4></li></ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Breakthrough Eva technology introduces users to a whole new way of showering. This high-tech mechanism features a desired temperature setting, unique sensor system that throttles water flow based off user’s needs, and a timer reminding users when their shower is too long.  </p>
<p>Eva's temperature shut off is one of the biggest water saving components of the device. Waiting just 30 seconds for your shower to warm up can equal a gallon of water wasted. With Eva, your shower will cut off water flow once your desired water temperature is reached. So if you turn on your shower and walk away to brush your teeth or make the bed, you won't have to worry about wasting any water.</p>
<ul><li><h4>Knowledge and Awareness</h4></li></ul>
<p>Providing Eva users with a simple, easy solution to conserve water is our way of shifting the way society views water consumption. With smart shower app statistics that bring daily awareness to users, we continue the cycle of revolutionizing the practice of water conservation, inspiring smart shower users to explore other ways of saving water and bettering the world.</p>

Eva in the Press


""This Gizmo wants to make your shower 'smart', cutting your water use in half"" - Entrepreneur Magazine
""Many parts of the world are experiencing the most debilitating water crises in recent history... Perhaps most people don’t talk about it because they don’t feel like much can be done. For this reason, the creators give you the chance to play your part with the Eva Smart Shower."" - Venture Beat
""It's a new gadget that can help you save big when it comes to your water bill"" - ABC7 Detroit  


 When you are directly underneath the shower head, wetting your hair or rinsing off soap, Eva sets your water flow to 100%. Providing you with a strong water flow right when you need it.
When you step away from the shower, shampooing your hair or scrubbing your body, Eva reduces the water flow; still keeping you nice and warm.
When you are further away from the shower, shaving your legs or anything else outside the flow of water, Eva reduces the water even more.  Simple and automatic.  

Eva begins tracking your water temperature from the moment your shower is turned on. Once the water reaches your desired temperature, Eva shuts off the flow of water and notifies you that your shower is ready; assuring you don’t waste any water.
 
 

Set your desired shower goals and Eva will track, remind and lead you to a more water conscious shower experience.
 

Eva automatically throttles water flow from 0% - 100% and everything in between. Saving water when its not needed, while maintaining an enjoyable shower experience.
 

Eva is designed to work with 90% of showers and shower heads.  Using standard 1/2” pipe fittings, Eva is mounted between your wall and shower head. Modern and sleek, Eva looks great in every shower.
 
  
Eva can be calibrated for an optimal shower experience, fitting any personal preferences or needs
 

Free specialized app provides you with comprehensive shower statistics, showing water usage habits and allowing comparison with the Eva community. Helping users learn and discover how to improve their water conservation efforts. Eva Smart Shower pays for itself in less than a year.
With the average price of water rising and majority of household water waste being in the shower, Eva will be able to pay for itself within a year of use. Eva's affordable price and water saving capabilities will prove to be an investment for the future.
 
 The Cause / Inspiration We believe, now more than ever, society needs to change its view on water consumption. The Eva team combined the power of technology with the sensibility of conservation to create a concept with the potential to make a significant impact on water usage with these principles in mind: Water Crisis
Countries all over the world are currently in some of the worst drought conditions in history, experiencing ""exceptional"" drought conditions - the harshest on a five-level scale. Consequences of this high level of drought include: exceptional and widespread crop/pasture losses and shortages of water in reservoirs, streams, and wells, creating water emergencies. According to the International Water Management Institute, the world can expect more extreme weather and rising numbers in the world's population, which will dramatically increase a demand for water. 
Smart Technology
Equipped with a specialized free mobile app, Eva gives users a more personalized way to shower. Through bluetooth technology, the Eva app is able to provide comprehensive shower statistics that allow you to track your water conservation efforts and compare results with the rest of the Eva community. An advanced algorithm also allows the shower’s sensor system to determine the amount of water used during a shower, while maintaining a high quality experience.
Shower Experience
 
Breakthrough Eva technology introduces users to a whole new way of showering. This high-tech mechanism features a desired temperature setting, unique sensor system that throttles water flow based off user’s needs, and a timer reminding users when their shower is too long.  
Eva's temperature shut off is one of the biggest water saving components of the device. Waiting just 30 seconds for your shower to warm up can equal a gallon of water wasted. With Eva, your shower will cut off water flow once your desired water temperature is reached. So if you turn on your shower and walk away to brush your teeth or make the bed, you won't have to worry about wasting any water.
Knowledge and Awareness
Providing Eva users with a simple, easy solution to conserve water is our way of shifting the way society views water consumption. With smart shower app statistics that bring daily awareness to users, we continue the cycle of revolutionizing the practice of water conservation, inspiring smart shower users to explore other ways of saving water and bettering the world.

Interesting Facts 
The average shower is 9 minutes long, using an estimated 19 gallons of water per shower.     - Using Eva can save up to 9.5 gallons/ shower
With 316.1 million people in the U.S., we are averaging 6 billion gallons of shower water per day.     - Eva could save the U.S. 3 billion gallons of water per day
The U.S. uses an average of 2.2 trillion gallons of shower water per year.     - Eva could save the U.S. over a trillion gallons of water every year.

On average, people spend half of their shower time away from the showerhead; shampooing, body washing, shaving, etc...
Due to drought, the cost of water has been rising rapidly in the past few years, and is quickly becoming one of a household’s costliest utility bills. Showers are one of the top contributors to a high water bill.

<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p><strong>We design, engineer, and manufacture products for simplicity and value.</strong></p>
<p>By having direct access and control over the full supply chain, as well as our sales and marketing efforts throughout North America and Europe, we are uniquely positioned as a DTC manufacturer who can cycle information and insights up or down channel extremely quickly. </p>
<p>We are confident we will meet our planned schedule, but there are risks that may be out of our control. If there are any delays, we promise to communicate with our backers right away. </p>
<p>After the campaign, we will share the steps of our journey towards manufacturing, packaging, and shipping, allowing each backer to stay in the loop and know where we are at in our timeline. </p>

Although they look the same, the inside key electronic components are updated with a more advanced motor and designed with different materials to ensure the product is fully certified with FCC and cTUVus.</p>
<p>We’ve also found some unauthorized sites “selling” our beta launch version of townew. As of now, <u><strong>Indiegogo is the ONLY official channel for backing TOWNEW in North America</strong></u>. We have not authorized any vendors or resellers at this point. To all our supporters, we urge you to be careful of any fake websites.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>Our team is hard at work developing large-size models for release next year. The Indiegogo community is amazing. Your feedback and support has played a critical role in the success of townew so far, which is why pre-order customers will have access to a special offer when the large size model is available.</p>

4 invention patents, 6 utility model patents and 2 appearance patents.& iF Design Award 2020

 

Are you still mopping the floor with your hands, bending down till you’re exhausted?Handi-mopper has got your back. With its high-frequency reciprocating motion, the robot mop’s patented dual-fiber pad technology simulates the rubbing action of your hands, leaving your floor clean, stainless, and shining like new!

 

No one likes hidden dirt under beds, sofas, along edges, and in corners. Neither does Handi-mopper. With its multiple modes of operation and a gyroscopic navigation system, it cleans every inch of your floor. Its small size means it can fit under your sofa and furniture, efficiently cleaning all hard-to-reach spaces.
 

Handi-mopper knows your home better than you do! It uses advanced positioning technology, mapping, and continuous learning to automatically plan its cleaning route for every room in your home. By track recording, the robot locates itself, remembers clean and non-clean zones, and navigates to new zones to avoid omissions and repetitions.

 


 

The sleek square design of this robot mop is not accidental: Unlike rounded moppers, Handi-mopper has access to all the corners of your house and leaves no dust there.


 

Handi-mopper not only gives the floor in your house a first-class deep clean but it can also disinfect and polish it. Just add any cleaning solution or polish to its tank. Keeping your floor clean has never been this easy! Empty water tank after using wax and dishwashing liquid.
 

No matter whether it’s light dust or stubborn spots caused by juice residue, Handi-mopper will remove them easily, effectively, and totally. Simply set the relevant mode and forget those stains ever existed.Adjust the humidity level of the water sprayer and mopping frequency and choose one of 3 modes. Handi-mopper will take care of all the rest! 

 

Edge Cleaning: The robot starts mopping alongside the walls.
 Standard Cleaning: The robot starts moving from the charging dock, mopping within 4m*4m zones one by one. Spiral Cleaning: The robot starts mopping from the setting point, drawing circles outward — one circle anti-clockwise and one circle — clockwise, following which it goes back to the start point. The diameter is 1.25 meters.   Handi-mopper works with the intuitive Tuya Smart App. Simply connect your robot mop to your Tuya app, set the cleaning mode and start mopping anytime, no matter where you are. You can also time the regular auto works for weeks to ensure the floor in your house is always clean. Handi-mopper is always on duty. With its built-in Wi-Fi connectivity, you can order it to clean your floor while you’re in the office or on vacation! And if you need more control, turn it on and track its progress through the app. All in all, what can be better than stepping into your house with a floor as clean as new?   Handi-mopper won’t ever fall down stairs. Thanks to its smart fall prevention sensors, it detects and escapes any height of at least 7 cm.  You don’t need to worry your robot mop will ever let you down and leave your floors dirty. Handi-mopper goes to the charge dock automatically once it finishes its cleaning task or its power is below 20%. After getting the necessary juice, it continues the unfinished task or waits for your next order. Made of durable materials, Handi-mopper is designed to last. It comes with a set of durable mops — made of 80% dacron and 20% chinlon — that can be used repeatedly. 1. Install the mops on the vibrating pieces and add water to the tank 2. Connect to Tuya App, set the cleaning mode 3. The robot mop starts smart cleaning 4. It returns automatically to the dock to recharge 5. Uninstall the mops and clean the tank     SWDK was developed by Ningbo SWDK Electronic Technology Co., Ltd..

<p><span>I failed my first two tests at school – my vision &amp; hearing tests! The tests revealed I was half-blind and half-deaf.</span></p>
<p>The crazy thing is … my vision loss was preventable. Early detection is critical.</p>My name is Chelsea Elliott, Executive Director of the <b><a href=""http://halfhelen.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Half Helen Foundation</a></b>. After learning about Helen Keller’s extraordinary life in 4th grade, I declared, “I’m half-blind, I’m half-deaf. I am half-Helen!” Helen Keller said, “The only thing worse than being blind is having sight but no vision.”<br/><br/>
</div><div><h3>The Facts ...</h3></div><div>
<p>Today, my passion is to improve vision and hearing globally by advocating for and strengthening screening practices. Advanced photoscreening technology exists, yet schools across the country still use the <b>153-year-old eye chart</b>.  Within seconds, a photoscreening device can screen children as young 6 months old for the 6 most common eye disorders. By December 2015, we will have screened over <b>20,000 children</b>. Approximately 2,600 of those children will need eye examinations and corrective ware.</p>
<p>Our biggest challenge is ensuring these children receive an eye exam and corrective treatment after identification of a problem. There is <b>NO </b>system in place to track a child through the process of initial screening, comprehensive exam, and follow-up care.</p>
<p><a href=""Why%20I%20Beg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><b>Half-Helen’s</b></a> next phase is to facilitate the interchange of children’s vision and hearing data between HHF and their parents, school, and doctors, to create wrap-around services that ensure that identified problems are addressed. </p>
<p>Our SaaS platform will allow stakeholders to communicate within the system and have access to the right information as a child moves from IN NEED to SUCCEED. Doctors, insurances companies, schools, and families - <b>CONNECTED</b>.</p>
<p><b>We Need Your Support!</b></p>

</div></div>","Why I Began The Half Helen Foundation ... 
I failed my first two tests at school – my vision & hearing tests! The tests revealed I was half-blind and half-deaf.
The crazy thing is … my vision loss was preventable. Early detection is critical.My name is Chelsea Elliott, Executive Director of the Half Helen Foundation. After learning about Helen Keller’s extraordinary life in 4th grade, I declared, “I’m half-blind, I’m half-deaf. I am half-Helen!” Helen Keller said, “The only thing worse than being blind is having sight but no vision.”
The Facts ...
Today, my passion is to improve vision and hearing globally by advocating for and strengthening screening practices. Advanced photoscreening technology exists, yet schools across the country still use the 153-year-old eye chart.  Within seconds, a photoscreening device can screen children as young 6 months old for the 6 most common eye disorders. By December 2015, we will have screened over 20,000 children. Approximately 2,600 of those children will need eye examinations and corrective ware.
Our biggest challenge is ensuring these children receive an eye exam and corrective treatment after identification of a problem. There is NO system in place to track a child through the process of initial screening, comprehensive exam, and follow-up care.
Half-Helen’s next phase is to facilitate the interchange of children’s vision and hearing data between HHF and their parents, school, and doctors, to create wrap-around services that ensure that identified problems are addressed. 
Our SaaS platform will allow stakeholders to communicate within the system and have access to the right information as a child moves from IN NEED to SUCCEED. Doctors, insurances companies, schools, and families - CONNECTED.
We Need Your Support!
Half Helen needs your support to develop and expand our screening and follow up services. Help us reach our goal today!  
The children are back in school!

80% of learning is visual. The equation is simple: if kids can't see, kids can't learn. 

All children deserve clear vision. Since 2013, Half Helen has provided high-tech vision screenings to over 12,000 children, referring over 1,200 for complete eye exams by eye care professionals. Support Half Helen in our mission to ensure children are capable of experiencing life's opportunities, and are not limited by preventable vision impairments.

With it, you can sear, bake, or fry with unbeatable results. No other type of pan even comes close. But out of convenience, cast-iron is often overlooked in favor of coated non-stick pans. We set out to change that — introducing Prepd Skillet.Prepd Skillet combines non-stick convenience with the performance, versatility, and durability of cast-iron, to create the ultimate pan. With a beautiful minimal aesthetic and polished smooth cooking surface, our skillet is unlike any cast-iron you’ve ever seen. Prepd Skillet can handle any challenge you throw at it and will take your cooking to the next level. It’s the only pan you will ever need. 
The cast-iron skillet is a durable and versatile workhorse, but the typically rough cooking surface means it’s not always a smooth operator, and food will occasionally stick. Through precision machining, we completely transform the cooking surface into one that’s perfectly smooth, making it naturally non-stick. The key to high performing cast-iron is a quality seasoning. With Prepd Skillet, we’ve done the hard work so you don’t have to. After polishing, we apply multiple coatings of grapeseed oil and extensive heat treatment so that it will outperform any other skillet, right out of the box.The extra hours of polishing and seasoning result in an incredibly smooth, non-stick finish — so smooth that you can fry an egg on it, without it sticking to the pan. 
Prepd Skillet rivals even the most high end coated non-stick pans — without any of the synthetic chemicals, so you can cook at high heat without any worries.

Prepd Skillet is designed to be the most versatile pan you have ever used. It gives the best results, whether you’re cooking on gas, electric or induction cooktops -- you can even use it on the campfire! Unlike other types of pans, cast-iron cooks food evenly -- not just on the surface. Cast-iron has far superior heat retention and volumetric heat capacity, emitting heat beyond the surface of the pan. This results in unbeatable sears, juicy roasts, and perfectly golden bakes that no other pan can offer. 
Prepd Skillet does the job of a roasting pan, a stainless steel skillet, and a non-stick all in one.

Our skillets are made with care, attention to detail and to the highest quality. Prepd Skillet is an investment that will last many generations, and better yet, it will only improve with age. Every use adds to the layers of seasoning, so your skillet will become even more non-stick the longer you use it.


Our skillet alone will dramatically improve how you cook. But we didn't stop there... We have created a resource of our favorite cast-iron dishes so that you'll be able to find awesome new recipes to cook for breakfast, lunch or dinner. From simple one-pan meals to fancy dishes that will impress your friends, there’s a recipe for every occasion.We’ve also designed an innovative set of accessories to complement your Prepd Skillet. Made from high-grade leather, the Handle Cover protects you when the pan gets hot. The cover is perfectly contoured to fit the Prepd Skillet handle while still allowing you to easily slide the cover on and off.  The Table Trivet protects your dining table or kitchen surface so you can take your meal directly from the oven to the table. It’s perfect for entertaining. Made from premium silicone and with a unique ventilated design, the trivet is also easy to clean.
 








 






We have been designing and working on the details of the skillet since 2017. Although the product looks very simple it has taken multiple iterations and prototypes of design and we have visited the facilities of dozens of manufacturers to get to this stage.
 
We have already created and refined the tooling for the product and we are very confident in our ability to deliver on time and at scale.

Over the last couple of years of developing Prepd, cooking has become one of the most important parts of our lives. Some of the most enjoyable moments have been sharing a home-cooked meal with friends and family, old and new, with a cast-iron skillet often taking center stage.
 
We became obsessed by cast iron skillets, not only for the results they give in the kitchen but by the way that they are made and as industrial designers and engineers we couldn’t help ourselves, we had to challenge convention and take this classic staple in the kitchen and respectfully modernized it, improving performance for everyday excellent cooking whilst retaining the heirloom quality of a 100-year-old skillet. 


We've already completed our first round of tooling, trialed the machining process, made first full samples and put them through their paces. We are truly blown away with the performance of these Skillets.

And they will help us to continue developing more products for the Dovetail collection.",29.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>Fermenta Lock - Makes Pickling Fresh Foods Easy</h2>
An all new Airlock Fermenting Lid, for Mason Jars. No awkward water lock sticking up on top of the lid, just a low profile, elegant little one-way valve that lets air out, but not in. <strong>So simple, all you need to know how to do, is twist the lid onto your pickling jar!</strong>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div align=""center""><img alt=""Pickled Salsa with Fermenta Lock Airlock Cap"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://fermentacap.com/salsasm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<div align=""center""><strong>Pickled Salsa</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Fermenta Lock is more economical than water lock pickling systems. One lid fits any size canning jar (you choose between narrow or wide mouth lid size). Unlike other Airlock Pickling Systems, you do not have to purchase an entire system for each size you need. One wide mouth lid goes on any wide mouth mason jar.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>The one-way valve is manufactured by hand in the United States. It is made of food grade silicone, not latex!</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>We need your help to make a good product better!</div>
<div>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>Where We Got Stuck</h2>
<strong>We are currently making the valves by hand.</strong> (""We"" means Kevin and Laura - you can read more about us, and our business model on our website.) <strong>We intend to continue to do so.</strong> Since no part exists that is like the one we need, we had to create our own mold for it. The materials available are not the best ones for the purpose, and our product is a little rougher than we need it to be. It functions well, but has a lot of surface texture.</div>
<div> </div>
<div align=""center""><img alt=""Fermenta Lock Airlock Valve"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://fermentacap.com/valve.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<div align=""center"">You can see the texture in this unretouched image.<br/>The valve is made of yellow silicone.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>We are also stuck having to pour just a few at a time, because we've only been able to make a few molds with the current method.</strong> This makes manufacturing very slow, since each pour has to cure for several hours in the molds.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>We can SELL the products. We can't produce them fast enough.</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<h2><strong>We need more molds! And we need BETTER molds.</strong></h2>
<div> </div>
<div>If we can obtain a Master Mold for each molded item, from which we can cast as many molds as we need, we will be able to expand as much as we need at an affordable cost. The Master Molds must be custom made (we can get them made in the U.S.). They must be custom machined, and this is a costly process.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>We also need some additional materials and equipment so that we can improve some of our other products.</strong> With these additional materials, we will be able to do the following:</div>
<ul>
<li>Create an <strong>airlock valve for our glass pickling crock, and purchase equipment to manufacture the lid and valve</strong>.</li>
<li>Get master molds and dies for our <strong>gaskets for crocks and lids</strong> (to make the manufacturing process faster), and obtain better home manufacturing tools for these items.</li>
<li>Improve the<strong> design and style of our Dunker food weights</strong>, and increase the weight so they function better. This will also bring the manufacturing of this product to the US (currently this product is ONLY available imported).</li>
<li>Develop a <strong>training program to train home business owners to manufacture the valves and glass products</strong>,  and create starter kits for home manufacturing, so that we do not have to create a factory environment to meet rising demand. This will allow other home business owners to earn a good living from making our products. (Laura has extensive experience developing training programs, she wrote the curriculum and materials for a Certification course for the University of Wyoming.) <strong>This will also make it possible for our product to go International - and for it to be manufactured in other countries to supply international needs.</strong>
</li>
<li>If we do not meet our goal, we'll make what we do receive go as far as possible in reaching our goals. If we receive more than our goal, we'll use the funds to invest in the next level of efficiency and productivity to make our product more available and better quality.<strong><br/></strong>
</li>
</ul><div>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>It Isn't Just About Making a Product to Make Food at Home</h2>
</div>
<div style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>It is about jobs in America - and jobs in other countries to fill orders placed in those countries.</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>We are committed to the concept of local and home food production, but we are also committed to the concept of home business and cottage industry. We've been involved in business startups (as a successful web development and startup consulting company for very small businesses), for more than a decade, and we know how to operate a successful company. When we chose to change our line of work, we knew we wanted to build something different.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you make a product from plastic or rubber (including silicone rubber), it must meet very specific requirements to be FDA approved for food use. It isn't just the components of the rubber or plastic, it is also how it is manufactured. Additional ingredients such as hardeners or substances to improve flexibility may be added during the manufacturing of the parts. <strong>It is difficult to tell which chemicals have been used.</strong>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Given the recent problems with contaminated products which were imported into the US, we knew that we did NOT feel good about contracting internationally for the parts we needed. <strong>Virtually all rubber and plastic fabrication is now done in India or China.</strong> Even companies in the US which provide fabrication services typically have the work done overseas. This hurts our company because we have less control over quality (we cannot see the materials used), and <strong>it hurts America (and many other countries) because jobs have left our country</strong>, along with the ability to GET certain kinds of work done within our own borders.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>By manufacturing this product ourselves, and expanding our business through small subcontractors, we can keep production for US orders in our own country, and REDUCE THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT of those jobs.</strong> When manufacturing occurs in a small shop setting, there are no catastrophic environmental impacts from factory facilities. Transportation is also reduced, because parts can be made close to the point of assembly.</div>
<div> </div>
<div style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>This isn't just a revolution in Airlock Pickling. It is a revolution in manufacturing!</strong></div>

An all new Airlock Fermenting Lid, for Mason Jars. No awkward water lock sticking up on top of the lid, just a low profile, elegant little one-way valve that lets air out, but not in. So simple, all you need to know how to do, is twist the lid onto your pickling jar!

 

Pickled Salsa
 
Fermenta Lock is more economical than water lock pickling systems. One lid fits any size canning jar (you choose between narrow or wide mouth lid size). Unlike other Airlock Pickling Systems, you do not have to purchase an entire system for each size you need. One wide mouth lid goes on any wide mouth mason jar.
 
The one-way valve is manufactured by hand in the United States. It is made of food grade silicone, not latex!
 
We need your help to make a good product better!

 
Where We Got Stuck
We are currently making the valves by hand. (""We"" means Kevin and Laura - you can read more about us, and our business model on our website.) We intend to continue to do so. Since no part exists that is like the one we need, we had to create our own mold for it. The materials available are not the best ones for the purpose, and our product is a little rougher than we need it to be. It functions well, but has a lot of surface texture.
 

You can see the texture in this unretouched image.The valve is made of yellow silicone.
 

We are also stuck having to pour just a few at a time, because we've only been able to make a few molds with the current method. This makes manufacturing very slow, since each pour has to cure for several hours in the molds.
 
We can SELL the products. We can't produce them fast enough.
 
We need more molds! And we need BETTER molds.
 
If we can obtain a Master Mold for each molded item, from which we can cast as many molds as we need, we will be able to expand as much as we need at an affordable cost. The Master Molds must be custom made (we can get them made in the U.S.). They must be custom machined, and this is a costly process.
 

We also need some additional materials and equipment so that we can improve some of our other products. With these additional materials, we will be able to do the following:

Create an airlock valve for our glass pickling crock, and purchase equipment to manufacture the lid and valve.
Get master molds and dies for our gaskets for crocks and lids (to make the manufacturing process faster), and obtain better home manufacturing tools for these items.
Improve the design and style of our Dunker food weights, and increase the weight so they function better. This will also bring the manufacturing of this product to the US (currently this product is ONLY available imported).
Develop a training program to train home business owners to manufacture the valves and glass products,  and create starter kits for home manufacturing, so that we do not have to create a factory environment to meet rising demand. This will allow other home business owners to earn a good living from making our products. (Laura has extensive experience developing training programs, she wrote the curriculum and materials for a Certification course for the University of Wyoming.) This will also make it possible for our product to go International - and for it to be manufactured in other countries to supply international needs.

If we do not meet our goal, we'll make what we do receive go as far as possible in reaching our goals. If we receive more than our goal, we'll use the funds to invest in the next level of efficiency and productivity to make our product more available and better quality.


 
It Isn't Just About Making a Product to Make Food at Home

It is about jobs in America - and jobs in other countries to fill orders placed in those countries.
 
We are committed to the concept of local and home food production, but we are also committed to the concept of home business and cottage industry. We've been involved in business startups (as a successful web development and startup consulting company for very small businesses), for more than a decade, and we know how to operate a successful company. When we chose to change our line of work, we knew we wanted to build something different.
 
If you make a product from plastic or rubber (including silicone rubber), it must meet very specific requirements to be FDA approved for food use. It isn't just the components of the rubber or plastic, it is also how it is manufactured. Additional ingredients such as hardeners or substances to improve flexibility may be added during the manufacturing of the parts. It is difficult to tell which chemicals have been used.

 
Given the recent problems with contaminated products which were imported into the US, we knew that we did NOT feel good about contracting internationally for the parts we needed. Virtually all rubber and plastic fabrication is now done in India or China. Even companies in the US which provide fabrication services typically have the work done overseas. This hurts our company because we have less control over quality (we cannot see the materials used), and it hurts America (and many other countries) because jobs have left our country, along with the ability to GET certain kinds of work done within our own borders.
 

By manufacturing this product ourselves, and expanding our business through small subcontractors, we can keep production for US orders in our own country, and REDUCE THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT of those jobs. When manufacturing occurs in a small shop setting, there are no catastrophic environmental impacts from factory facilities. Transportation is also reduced, because parts can be made close to the point of assembly.
 
This isn't just a revolution in Airlock Pickling. It is a revolution in manufacturing!

The other conventional solutions available currently are either extremely complex to configure as a parent or highly expensive to own. Often, the other available solutions are hard-coded in the device you use and lack latest updates to protect you from ever-evolving threats.</p><p>Audra believes every home has its own ecosystem of values and beliefs. These values should reflect in the digital habits of the members of that home. So the possible set of internet controls should reside as choices, in a simple and playful manner; parents will decide which controls to apply - how, when, and to what extent. While we have kept robust performance at the back-end, we ensured the interface is extremely simple, to deliver playfulness and delight at the parent end. Audra comes with an aesthetically appealing gateway device, that syncs and pairs up with the intelligent cloud AI. The cloud AI works as the core brain and gives updated controls to parents through the gateway device, to prevent users and smart devices from unwanted use, cyber threats, external attacks and more.</p><p>Like we said earlier, the re-engineered Audra HomeShield is the result of thousands of hours of R&amp;D, user feedbacks and design works. And now, we have finally gone into mass production!

We kept effectiveness at the core and simplicity on the interface, to ensure that parents across the world can easily set their own internet rules to bring digital balance in and secured internet for the beloved members of their home.After multiple rounds of R&D and prototyping, we unveiled the first version of Audra HomeShield with Audra Cloud AI to 1,000+ beta testers across the US, Europe, South America and SE Asia, who shared with us their valuable insights, suggestions and feedback.We are now ready to offer you the re-imagined and perfectly engineered Audra HomeShield; the 'DO IT ALL' cloud AI-based internet security solution that comes with a sleek gateway device, for your own protection, and for the protection of your connected home and its occupants. With Audra HomeShield, you now can easily...​The Audra philosophy: My internet, My rulesAudra Team is relentlessly working to bring in the solid controls needed to ensure cyber security from known and unknown threats. The other conventional solutions available currently are either extremely complex to configure as a parent or highly expensive to own. Often, the other available solutions are hard-coded in the device you use and lack latest updates to protect you from ever-evolving threats.Audra believes every home has its own ecosystem of values and beliefs. These values should reflect in the digital habits of the members of that home. So the possible set of internet controls should reside as choices, in a simple and playful manner; parents will decide which controls to apply - how, when, and to what extent. While we have kept robust performance at the back-end, we ensured the interface is extremely simple, to deliver playfulness and delight at the parent end. Audra comes with an aesthetically appealing gateway device, that syncs and pairs up with the intelligent cloud AI. The cloud AI works as the core brain and gives updated controls to parents through the gateway device, to prevent users and smart devices from unwanted use, cyber threats, external attacks and more.Like we said earlier, the re-engineered Audra HomeShield is the result of thousands of hours of R&D, user feedbacks and design works. And now, we have finally gone into mass production! It has been quite a fascinating and rewarding journey.  WHAT SOME OF THE EXPERTS SAY  Encourage Audra to bring secured internet for millions of homes.",28.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Can Homefarm grow fruits and vegetables?</strong></p>
<p>Homefarm is not designed to grow fruits and vegetables. It should be used to grow leafy greens, herbs and microgreens, as per the available selection of seed-pods. Refer to crop examples above for an example of the types of crops Homefarm can grow.</p>
<p><strong>Why does Homefarm not grow fruits and vegetables?</strong></p>
<p>Fruits and vegetables have very long yield times and low harvests per unit area in comparison to herbs and microgreens. This is why Homefarm's primary use is geared towards leafy greens, herbs and microgreens which can be harvested regularly by the user. Fruit and vegetable plants also require a greater amount of light to bear fruit than what Homefarm has been designed to offer. Note: Homefarm has had limited success with chillies.</p>
<p><strong>How will I get my seedpods after I get my Homefarm?</strong></p>
<p>You will be able to purchase seed-pods through our online store which we will be launching in October this year. If you live outside of South Africa we will only post Homefarm seed pods in minimum quantities of 10 boxes per shipping.</p>
<p><strong>How much will the Seed-Pod boxes cost?</strong></p>
<p>For a box of 6 seed-pods we will be charging approximately 15$ per box or R150 in South Africa.</p>
<p><strong>How much will I be able to harvest with my Homefarm?</strong></p>
<p>If growing 50% microgreens and 50% herbs in a Homefarm you can expect to harvest 1 – 2 portions of microgreens per day and 2-3 handfuls of herbs each week.  </p>
<p><strong>How long will it take to pay off my Homefarm from my savings incurred as a result of being able to grow my own herbs and greens?</strong></p>
<p>You could pay off a Homefarm within 18 months.</p>
<p><strong>If I cannot connect it to my water-mains, how often will I need to re-water?</strong></p>
<p>You will need to manually re-fill the water tank every 3 to 4 days. You will be notified on the User Interface as well as through the dedicated Homefarm App.</p>
<p><strong>Will I need to turn the lights on and off manually with the product?</strong></p>
<p>No. The products automatically controls the lighting cycles as well as the other Homefarm systems.</p>
<p><strong>Does Homefarm grow organic produce?</strong></p>
<p>Not yet. We have plans to sell an organic seed-pod range in the future but for now Homefarm uses a non-organic nutrient, much the same as all other non-organic produce bought in stores.</p>
<p><strong>Do Homefarm crops require pesticide?</strong></p>
<p>No. If used correctly, Homefarm creates a closed environment for its crops and therefore crops are protected from bugs infesting them.</p>
<p><strong>Can Homefarm grow Marijuana?</strong></p>
<p>If, in accordance with the laws of your country, you are allowed to grow Marijuana in your own home, and you possess all of the necessary permits, Homefarm can be used to grow Marijuana plants for the first 8-10 weeks of the growth cycle.</p>

<p>There are four possible challenges we face which could result in the late delivery of contributor’s perks.</p>
<p>The first is compliance. The compliance process typically takes about 2 months if all goes smoothly. However, it is possible that the compliance process takes a little longer if design improvements and development interventions are needed during the process. The cost of these interventions would not be high but could lead to a delay.</p>
<p>The second is manufacturing. When one goes through your first major production run of a physical product, the failure rate can be higher than you’d ideally like, which means some parts may need to be sent back to the manufacturer for re-manufacture. This can lead to delays. We would be covered by Quality Assurance agreements so this would not pose a financial risk to the project and ultimate delivery.</p>
<p>The third is around the logistics of distribution and delivery. We will do everything ahead of time to ensure that our delivery plans are in place for all the relevant geographical locations that we ship to, but sometimes there can be unforeseen challenges in the shipment process which can cause delays.  </p>
<p>The fourth is related to the outcome and success of the campaign itself. If we receive many more pledges than we expect and as a result have to produce many more Homefarms to reward our backers, we will need to re-assess our manufacturing strategy which will likely cause a delay, most probably by a couple of months as we would need the time to scale our manufacturing capability beyond what we are planning for this campaign. </p>
<p>In every instance, we promise to be completely transparent and will communicate frequently with our backers to ensure that they are in the know regarding our progress and schedule at all times.</p>

The income and opportunity gap between the rich

anywhere else in the nation.  Did you
know that when families are homeless or hungry, school clothing is not a top
priority?  As the result, thousands of
children living in poverty miss school or are unable to fully participate in
class or on the playground due to a lack of suitable clothing.  Attending school in ill-fitting shoes and
clothing can be physically uncomfortable and embarrassing for children. It can
affect their self-esteem and mark them as easy targets for bullying.   </div><div><br/></div><div>

</div></div>","The Problem
Stress and fatigue in the United States are at an all time high.
As a result, sugary energy drinks and coffee are being consumed at an alarming rate. 
But...we all know that these products aren't healthy or sustainable solutions.
The Solution
Tea is one of the healthiest drinks on the planet.
As a health nut in search of a better way, I have devoted the last 4 years of my life to creating the best supplements for natural energy. 
It started with superfood tea blends.

ClearTea provides physical energy that keep you feeling energized throughout the day.
Brainiac provides a smooth boost of mental energy to help you concentrate and focus.

The feedback from tea drinkers has been even better than expected. Most people are raving about them...

Enter the capsule...



Using a capsule allows you to completely avoid the taste.
It also allows us to use some amazing ingredients that we wanted to include in our tea blends, but quickly ruled out due to their awful taste.
Bacopa Monnieri and Ginkgo Biloba give Brainiac capsules an enhanced focus boost.
Ashwaganga and Panax Ginseng give ClearTea capsules a lasting endurance boost.

But trust us, you don't want these ingredients anywhere near your taste buds. 
Now you really can get the healthiest supplements your way...

FAQ...

  
Q: How will Opportuniteas superfood tea blends help me?
Our superfood tea blends are natural, nutrient dense formulas designed to cover the needs of active people. You get phenomenal nutritional insurance because we use a wide variety of ingredients from nature. This makes it much easier to avoid nutrient deficiencies and optimize total body health. Whole foods boost energy. You can feel the difference. Most importantly...Absolutely no compromises! 
We don’t use any artificial sweeteners, colors, flavors, additives, or preservatives.

Q: I have a medical condition or am pregnant/nursing. Is it safe to use Opportuniteas or other dietary supplements?
Check with your doctor first. Everyone is beautiful and unique. Some foods are perfectly fine for most everyone but can be harmful to others. Thousands of people have tried our superfood tea blends and we have not heard of any major adverse reactions beyond not enjoying the natural flavor. While medical experts have guided us in every step along the way, we cannot give advice on your specific medical conditions.
Q: What are the major risks and challenges? 
Any business that relies on crops grown outdoors has some degree of variability. Not every batch of matcha or goji berry is the exact same. However we've put in a lot of time finding the best sources for ingredients. We already have a robust supply chain in place with multiple ingredient suppliers, manufacturers, and distributors ready to go.  
We've already gone through the painstaking process of bringing new products to market for our current superfood tea blends. If anything unexpected arises manufacturing capsules we will let you know right away, but we expect everything to be delivered on time or even early.

Q: Where are Opportuniteas products made?
All of our products are manufactured in a Good Manufacturing Processes Certified and FDA certified facility here in the USA.

Conventional thermometers can be uncomfortable for children. Kids don’t like
things in their mouth, ears … or elsewhere! Fever Smart sits comfortably under a
child’s armpit.</p>
<p><b>Continuous Readings:</b>
Normal thermometers can’t catch dangerous temperature spikes because they only
provide one-time readings. Fever Smart can help address a health problem before
it’s too late.</p>
<p><b>Accurate:</b> We chose to
measure axillary temperature because it is the most accurate non-invasive
temperature reading. Fever Smart is less prone to effects from ambient
temperature than other devices that measure temperature on extremities like
hands or feet.</p>

Smart is less expensive than most other wearables on the market.</p><p></p>

<p>
</p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Is Fever Smart safe to use?</b><br/></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Fever Smart is absolutely safe. We have FDA certification and our device is designed to provide the most accurate temperature readings in a safe, non-invasive way. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p>
<p><b>How does Fever Smart measure temperature?</b></p>
<p>Fever Smart uses axillary (under the armpit) temperature. Axillary temperature is usually 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) lower than an oral temperature reading.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p>
<p><b>Why does Fever Smart use axillary temperature?</b></p>
<p>Fever Smart uses axillary temperature because it allows for accurate non-invasive temperature readings.<br/></p>
<p><b>What is a ""relay unit""?</b></p>
<p>The relay unit is a iPad, iPod touch or smartphone that sits in the same room as the child. The relay unit is able to receive the bluetooth transmission from the Fever Smart device and relay it to you over wifi. The Fever Smart device can also communicate directly to your smartphone via bluetooth, but the range is limited (15 feet).</p>
<p><b>What devices can be used as a ""relay unit""?</b></p>
<p>We currently support any device after (and including): iPhone 4s, iPod Touch 5, iPad 3, and iPad Mini. The new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus will also be compatible with the device.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Will Fever Smart work with Android, Blackberry, Windows? When will my platform be supported?</strong></p>
<p>Prior to launch, we are developing for iOS. In the future, Fever Smart will also be accessible through Android, and a mobile-friendly and tablet-friendly web app which can be accessed on any web-enabled device or any device within Bluetooth range.</p>
<p><b>Does Fever Smart come with any of the disposable patches?</b></p>
<p>Of course! Each Fever Smart is shipped with 10 disposable patches. Additional patches can be purchased at an affordable price. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>How can Fever Smart help my child's pediatrician?</b></p>
<p>With Fever Smart, you can track your child's temperature trends over time and send this information to their pediatrician. Doctors can use the data to create personalized healthcare solutions.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>I live outside of the United States, can I pre-order a Fever
Smart?</b></p>
<p>Yes. Fever Smart will ship worldwide.</p>
<p><strong>What are the shipping costs?</strong></p>
<p>Shipping in the US is included. There is an additional cost of
$20 for international shipping. Shipment does not include extra fees from
customs, or additional costs associated with your country. If it turns out that
shipment to your country proves impossible, we will reimburse your order.</p>
<p><b>Is the battery replaceable?</b></p>
<p>Yes - if the battery ever runs out, you can simply replace
it. Fever Smart uses CR2025, which can be purchased at any convenience
store.</p>
<p><b>Is the device waterproof?</b></p>
<p>No. Fever Smart should not be used in the bath or pool. </p>

We created this device
with children in mind. The Fever Smart team worked together with parents and
children to create the best design and product for our users. We performed
extensive testing to ensure quality, accuracy, and safety.




Why we are different
Easy to Use: Fever
Smart’s system is quick to set up, and our device is extremely easy to use.
Comfortable:
Conventional thermometers can be uncomfortable for children. Kids don’t like
things in their mouth, ears … or elsewhere! Fever Smart sits comfortably under a
child’s armpit.
Continuous Readings:
Normal thermometers can’t catch dangerous temperature spikes because they only
provide one-time readings. Fever Smart can help address a health problem before
it’s too late.
Accurate: We chose to
measure axillary temperature because it is the most accurate non-invasive
temperature reading. Fever Smart is less prone to effects from ambient
temperature than other devices that measure temperature on extremities like
hands or feet.
Affordable: Fever
Smart is less expensive than most other wearables on the market.

Product Development
Our device is designed
and developed- we are 100% ready to manufacture. The machines are tooled up and
the sample devices have been tested.
After two years of hard work, we’ve come a long way with Fever Smart. Now we need your help: your support will allow us to finalize the first round of manufacturing so that we can make Fever Smart available to the public. Help us share our technology so that together we can bring peace of mind to millions of parents around the world.How it works

Place the small device underneath your child's armpit using one of the disposable patches.The device constantly measures the child's temperature and sends the data to a relay unit, which is any iPad, iPod touch or smartphone that sits in the same room as the child. This relay unit then sends the data to the cloud, so you can access the information from anywhere in the world via a smart device.  



Download the Fever Smart app on your phone and use it to track your child's health. 
You can set individual parameters for temperature thresholds: when the
child's temperature exceeds the set thresholds, you will receive alerts so you can
take immediate action.

FAQ



Is Fever Smart safe to use?
Fever Smart is absolutely safe. We have FDA certification and our device is designed to provide the most accurate temperature readings in a safe, non-invasive way. 

How does Fever Smart measure temperature?
Fever Smart uses axillary (under the armpit) temperature. Axillary temperature is usually 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) lower than an oral temperature reading.


Why does Fever Smart use axillary temperature?
Fever Smart uses axillary temperature because it allows for accurate non-invasive temperature readings.
What is a ""relay unit""?
The relay unit is a iPad, iPod touch or smartphone that sits in the same room as the child. The relay unit is able to receive the bluetooth transmission from the Fever Smart device and relay it to you over wifi. The Fever Smart device can also communicate directly to your smartphone via bluetooth, but the range is limited (15 feet).
What devices can be used as a ""relay unit""?
We currently support any device after (and including): iPhone 4s, iPod Touch 5, iPad 3, and iPad Mini. The new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus will also be compatible with the device.

Will Fever Smart work with Android, Blackberry, Windows? When will my platform be supported?
Prior to launch, we are developing for iOS. In the future, Fever Smart will also be accessible through Android, and a mobile-friendly and tablet-friendly web app which can be accessed on any web-enabled device or any device within Bluetooth range.
Does Fever Smart come with any of the disposable patches?
Of course! Each Fever Smart is shipped with 10 disposable patches. Additional patches can be purchased at an affordable price. 

How can Fever Smart help my child's pediatrician?
With Fever Smart, you can track your child's temperature trends over time and send this information to their pediatrician. Doctors can use the data to create personalized healthcare solutions.

I live outside of the United States, can I pre-order a Fever
Smart?
Yes. Fever Smart will ship worldwide.
What are the shipping costs?
Shipping in the US is included. There is an additional cost of
$20 for international shipping. Shipment does not include extra fees from
customs, or additional costs associated with your country. If it turns out that
shipment to your country proves impossible, we will reimburse your order.
Is the battery replaceable?
Yes - if the battery ever runs out, you can simply replace
it. Fever Smart uses CR2025, which can be purchased at any convenience
store.
Is the device waterproof?
No. Fever Smart should not be used in the bath or pool.

<p>From basic security monitoring to complex devices, homeowners are increasingly focusing on comfort and convenience.</p>
<p>For security and privacy reasons, people have already gone for risk-free, easy-to-use solutions in the shape of security camera systems, and with fast-changing technology, these systems look as if they're popped from the future.</p>
<p>Along with advantages, existing security cameras also come with disadvantages such as laborious installation, pesky false alerts, high cost, etc.</p>
<p>We want to change all that:</p>

<p>One of the biggest challenges in the development of eyecloudCam was to collect all smart features of security cameras on a single device. We also wanted to make<strong> all AI features</strong> - motion and person detection, and face recognition - <strong>as accessible as possible</strong>.</p>
<p>Thanks to our team, we worked out the right solution.</p>

<div> </div></section></div>","eyecloudCam is the first standalone battery-powered home security camera with built-in AI that also features on-device face recognition.
 


 
From basic security monitoring to complex devices, homeowners are increasingly focusing on comfort and convenience.
For security and privacy reasons, people have already gone for risk-free, easy-to-use solutions in the shape of security camera systems, and with fast-changing technology, these systems look as if they're popped from the future.
Along with advantages, existing security cameras also come with disadvantages such as laborious installation, pesky false alerts, high cost, etc.
We want to change all that:


 
One of the biggest challenges in the development of eyecloudCam was to collect all smart features of security cameras on a single device. We also wanted to make all AI features - motion and person detection, and face recognition - as accessible as possible.
Thanks to our team, we worked out the right solution.
 




 
In the long run, the most important thing for us was to develop an all-in-one intelligent, affordable, easy-to-use solution that does not require cables or any other additional devices, and keeps people in touch with their homes regardless of their location.
 

 


 

 
Cordless and Wireless
 
eyecloudCam is amazing in that it is an independent, flexible, cordless device. You don't have to worry about the [un]available sockets in your house, cable management, the dust that might gather on the wiring, your cat chewing the cords, or about a power outage.
 

 
Easy-to-Mount
 
eyecloudCam can be placed on any horizontal area or can be stuck to a vertical surface, ceiling or roof in a jiffy.
Thanks to our practical and innovative design, our portable security solution provides an easy & quick set-up and can be installed anywhere, without any pins and needles.
Just a double glued circle sticker, a magnetic mount, and 3 extra-screws, just to be sure.
 

 
A Rechargeable Battery That Can Last Up to 6 Months
 
eyecloudCam comes with a built-in rechargeable battery. To enhance the experience, we've managed to extend the battery life by using a high-capacity rechargeable lithium battery inside eyecloudCam & applying energy saving AI technology for less energy consumption.
 

 
Depending on user settings, usage and temperature, the battery can last up to six months in standby mode.
 

 
Eliminates Most False Alerts
 
eyecloudCam goes along with a PIR  sensor that measures infrared light radiating from ""objects"" and distinguishes humans from other non-humans [animals, environment]. 
When eyecloudCam detects a person, it starts recording and stores videos locally.
 






 
Superior Data Privacy
 

After food, water, warmth and rest, security and safety are next in the hierarchy of needs.
The same goes for data. For us, data privacy should be neither an option nor a luxury - it is an imperative and a necessity that we are committed to.
Our awesome solution allows on-device processing, without requiring an internet connection, and provides a high-level of protection similar to bank-grade encryption, to ensure that your sensitive data stays with you only and as safe as possible.
 
24/7 Crisp Videos and Livestreaming
 
Truly wireless, portable, weatherproof and noninvasive, eyecloudCam is the perfect solution for your outdoor security and safety needs, recording 1080p videos, day and night, at a 110° viewing angle. 
eyecloudCam stores ±1600 10 to 30-second videos locally. When the internal storage [32 GB] reaches maximum capacity, the oldest videos are automatically erased, making space for the latest ones. If you wish to save certain videos, you can download them to your phone.
 

 


 

 
Your Home - A Pocket Away
 
With eyecloudCam you can take your home everywhere you go. Get remote access and live stream anytime you want, no matter your location via your iOS or Android smartphone.
Oh, and there's more! You can also share your camera with others, as long as they have the app on their phones. So, if you're in the middle of nowhere and don't have access to the internet, you can ask a friend to check over your crib.
 


 

 

 

 
Embedded Person Detection Technology Eliminates Almost All False Alerts
 
Most false alarms are caused by falling leaves, animals, cars and other moving objects in the monitoring range.
To solve this problem, we have developed and implemented an optimized embedded neural network, and employed AI algorithms on people detection to eliminate most false alarms.
 


 
 
Embedded Neural Network allows eyecloudCam to see and analyze objects in the monitoring range, avoiding false alarms caused by falling leaves, animals, cars and other moving objects.
 

 

 
Essential to our innovation was our experience working on Intel's Movidius VPU, as well as our expertise in computer vision, image sensors, and AI algorithms.
 


 
 


 

 


 

 
Premium No Longer Means Expensive
 
Rechargeable batteries, 32GB of local storage, product versatility, and no cables - these are the ingredients chosen to create the perfect small home security camera to the tune of $130.
 

 

 

 

 
Our intuitive app was designed in such a way that it does all the setup for you.
Just download the app, register with your email, log in, switch on eyecloudCam, and then sync your smartphone to the device.

the first 3D Printer and Mini CNC machine designed specifically for home

CNC communities and put them in a home friendly form. It is constructed from precision cnc machined MDF parts and quality components to produce a strong and accurate machine. Each machine will also include a professionally engineered and machined 0.4mm nozzle.

The build area is 150mmx150x100. It is shipped ready for 1.75mm PLA filament but can be adapted easily for 3mm PLA.

Also we have finalised a website, SUMPOD.COM, that not only will be

<h3>Our Story:</h3>
<h3>Two years ago I decided to take a break from my life as a puppeteer.  I loved my work, but my aging body was having a hard time with the set-up, tear-down, tour around, part of it.  I took that break by going to S. Korea to teach English. While there, I discovered the most wonderful ancient art form of Hanji and completely fell in love!  Hanji is hand made paper art for the home; lamps, bowls, platters, paintings, and furniture.  The possibilities are endless.  Now I'm making these beautiful lamps and people are ooohing and ahhhing, but it's a <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">hand made object</span> and in order to grow the business at all, I must be able to make more product. I need building support!!  <br/>
</h3>
<h3>I recently ran an ad on Craig's List for piece work thinking to sub-contract some of the components. I had over 50 responses!  People are hungry out there!  Heck, I'm hungry!  So my dream is to create a small cottage industry that can keep myself and a 2-4 other people happily employed. This campaign will support me in creating enough Hanji lamps and other objects for the home to do my first arts festival in Atlanta, Georgia. It is the Inman Park Festival which runs April 30 and May 1. <br/>
</h3>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact:  </h3>
<h3>The response to the Craig's list ad was a bit sad on the one hand, but uplifting on the other.  I feel good about being able to offer reasonable pay for happy, part time work. I can see the possibility of this becoming an ongoing,  thriving cottage industry.  Local artists will get some  part time work, we get to support an ancient hand made craft of S. Korea, and we get to  light the world, one hand made lamp at a time!  <br/>
</h3>
<h3>If this campaign doesn't happen, I'll just do the best I can.  It's hard out here folks. <br/>
</h3>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get:</h3>
<h3>We need $2,860.00 to accomplish the following: <br/>
</h3>
<h3>Get two local artists to work 10 hours a week for the next 8 weeks @ $10.00/hr. = $1600. <br/>
</h3>
<h3>Support in buying and shipping some of the materials from Korea = $400.</h3>
<h3>Materials to make a booth = $500. <br/>
</h3>
<h3>Application fee for the Inman Park Festival, Atlanta, Georgia = $300.  <br/>
</h3>
<h3>$60.00 to rent a generator for the weekend (got to light the lamps!)<br/>
</h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>What you get: </h3>
<h3>For a $10 donation you get a cup of joe if you can make it to Asheville. <br/>
</h3>
<h3>For a $25 donation you get a piece of Hanji paper mailed to your home. <br/>
</h3>
<h3>For $50 you get a little 3x5 Hanji painting (unframed) mailed to your home. <br/>

The original Duck House did so much for the chapter, and many brothers have said that when <strong>ΔΥ</strong> had that house, that it was the peak of DU...The men of Delta Upsilon have become a closer brotherhood and are bouncing back from a tough spot in which the hardwork of these men have started a movement of new positive momentum...it is do or die time brothers, either we keep the positive momentum strong and we bounce back better than ever before, or we will fall and fail.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A central house for DU will add additional fuel to spark the momentum that our men have started. Currently we have no central place to come together except for at chapter. The Duck House will provide the central location for new event's, a welcoming place to hang out, an opportunity to grow and gain a sense of brotherhood many haven't yet seen. The house is a house full of memories for our Alumni, and getting this house back will be an honor to them. This house is essential to the future of DU.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The men moving into this house will have to overcome the most infamous landlord in all of Tempe, and are doing so for the sake of the chapter. Rent is $1500, and the deposit will be 1-1.5x rent which will put move-in costs at $3000+. The house is 5 bedrooms, and will quickly fill. The rent after move-in after being filled is very affordable, but move-in will be financially difficult. Help these brothers stepping up to bring back the Duckhouse, and we will grow!</p>
<p>$1000 will negate the costs enough to make move-in possible, if over $1000 is raised, all the money will go to getting this house set up for DU and benefit the chapter....a Duck House party will definately be happening when we have this house.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Anyone that can donate will be recognized and be greatly appreciated by the entire chapter. Dispursement of financial aid for Spring starts on 12/31/12, so the deadline will be set for slightly after that date. Please donate what you can..All the funds will go directly to bringing the Duck House back for DU.</p>

The Duck House will provide the central location for new event's, a welcoming place to hang out, an opportunity to grow and gain a sense of brotherhood many haven't yet seen. The house is a house full of memories for our Alumni, and getting this house back will be an honor to them. This house is essential to the future of DU.
 
The men moving into this house will have to overcome the most infamous landlord in all of Tempe, and are doing so for the sake of the chapter. Rent is $1500, and the deposit will be 1-1.5x rent which will put move-in costs at $3000+. The house is 5 bedrooms, and will quickly fill. The rent after move-in after being filled is very affordable, but move-in will be financially difficult. Help these brothers stepping up to bring back the Duckhouse, and we will grow!
$1000 will negate the costs enough to make move-in possible, if over $1000 is raised, all the money will go to getting this house set up for DU and benefit the chapter....a Duck House party will definately be happening when we have this house.
 
Anyone that can donate will be recognized and be greatly appreciated by the entire chapter. Dispursement of financial aid for Spring starts on 12/31/12, so the deadline will be set for slightly after that date. Please donate what you can..All the funds will go directly to bringing the Duck House back for DU.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Biogas is an amazing natural energy source that has been greatly under-utilized in the United States.Biogas is virtually identical to fossil natural gas, only instead of taking 65 million years to make, it can be made every day in your own backyard using a simple biodigester using no moving parts, special equpment or chemicals.</p>
<p>My name is Warren Weisman, I am one of only a handful of biogas and anaerobic digestion experts in the United States, even though biogas is easier to make a fire with than wood. I have over 20 years experience as a builder and have worked as a heavy equipment mechanic and power plant operator. Together with my business partner David Rasmussen, we want to popularize biogas technology by offering simple, low-cost biodigesters that are easy-to-operate by busy homeowners and small farmers to generate clean burning biogas for home cooking fuel, or to fuel electric generators, pumps or water heaters.</p>
<p>There are nearly 50 million households in China presently using biogas and in Sweden many cities run their entire transit bus fleets off biogas, yet less than a dozen homes in the United States. We would like to introduce small-scale domestic biogas use to the United States for customers to enjoy energy independence, reduce environmental impacts and utility bills while recycling valuable nutrients for local gardening and farming. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are seeking $10,000 to put towards development of a double burner biogas stovetop that is UL approved for indoor domestic use in North America currently under development at Oregon State University and a marketing campaign to increase local and national awareness of home biogas.</p>
<p>We will offer $25 contributors a pdf version of Warren Weisman's ""Energy From Organic Waste Vol. 1: Introduction to Biogas"" booklet, which includes several links to learn more about biogas online. The pdf file will be delivered electronically and  a copy of Hestia Home Biogas Home Biogas Generator Building Plans, a complete set of building plans for building one of our 600-gallon home biogas digesters. This includes a copy of ""Energy From Organic Waste Vol. 1"" and unlimited online technical support during bulding, start-up and operation of your home biogas digester.</p>
<p>Our $100 contributors will receive a complete biogas demonstration kit with 5-gallon anaerobic digester and 10-page instruction booklet. </p>
<p>Our $1,000 contributors will receive and a Hestia Home Biogas double burner stovetop legal for indoor domestic use in North America and a $500 discount on any home biogas digester or small farm digester purchase.</p>
<p>The Marketing campaign will be scalable, and if our goals aren't met, we will downsize our plans to suit our available budget.</p>
<p>Home scale biogas could be far better utilized if more people were aware of it. If you cannot contribute, please be sure to learn more about biogas and tell your friends about this amazing completely natural energy. Please share if you cannot contribute yourself. Thank you!</p>

<div><h3>Health Cam AI (Under Development)</h3></div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://accendstudios.com/gifs/fishmobile.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The FELIX Healthcam lets you know when your fish and plants are doing well or when it's time to take notice; alerting you of any potential problems before they happen. FELIX will also make recommendations based on this feedback. The technology we are developing is centred around image recognition, machine learning and neural networks. In its simplest explanation, it's a recommendation engine using image recognition to compare your fish against other fish in our data base. This is a long term project that will be developed and deployed in stages. We are passionate and committed to it as we believe that the implications of this technology will be game changing, not only for aquarium owners, but for zoos, conservationists, universities and researchers. We look forward to sharing more information about the FELIX Healthcam in the months ahead. You can read more about  <a href=""https://medium.com/intro-to-artificial-intelligence/deep-learning-series-1-intro-to-deep-learning-abb1780ee20"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">deep learning and neural networks here.</a></p>

Pro Guide AR


The FELIX Pro Guide Augmented Reality helps you create the perfect aquarium. It's as simple as scanning your aquarium with your AR enabled smartphone. Based on your existing layout, FELIX AR engine will provide you with recommendations on how to improve your existing aquarium.
 
Health Cam AI (Under Development)

The FELIX Healthcam lets you know when your fish and plants are doing well or when it's time to take notice; alerting you of any potential problems before they happen. FELIX will also make recommendations based on this feedback. The technology we are developing is centred around image recognition, machine learning and neural networks. In its simplest explanation, it's a recommendation engine using image recognition to compare your fish against other fish in our data base. This is a long term project that will be developed and deployed in stages. We are passionate and committed to it as we believe that the implications of this technology will be game changing, not only for aquarium owners, but for zoos, conservationists, universities and researchers. We look forward to sharing more information about the FELIX Healthcam in the months ahead. You can read more about  deep learning and neural networks here.
 

Arrow Certification Program

FELIX is proudly Arrow Certified! With the assistance of Arrow Electronics and their extensive knowledge of supply chain management, engineering and production, we look to produce a world class product on time and on budget.
 
Give us a Turbo Boost

We’ve completed our prototyping, sourced our parts, and are now finalizing the development of our tools and molds with the aim of starting initial production for supporters in March and full production for retail in June. To launch production, we have set a goal of $30,000 for this campaign. 
The best part about being a supporter of our campaign is the direct input you will have in creating some of the features that will end up in the APP. We'll stay in very close contact with all of our supporters and provide you with tools to communicate your ideas to us. 
 

Meet The Co-Founders

Oliver Knott, George Farmer and Esther Mous are some of the passionate co-founders of FELIX. Their extensive experience with fish, plants, and aquariums, combined with a team of talented engineers, software developers, researchers and entrepreneurs, has brought FELIX to this stage.

Fed up of having our helmets hidden in cupboards or torn by traditional coat hooks, we came up with a solution: the Halley Helmet Rack.Our aim at Halley is to give your helmet the place it deserves in your home, somewhere special to display it. We wanted our first product to look elegant and attractive as a piece of design whilst also prioritizing function.  The smooth, spherical design is made to create a large surface area and fewer pressure points inside the helmet. This stops the lining from tearing and distorting, a problem often caused by traditional racks and hooks.  The design is minimalist and smart, whilst also versatile to suit the rider’s own style. The black matt coloring represents our clean and sophisticated aesthetics. Our vision is to create a timeless look by using quality materials and smooth finishes. Halley obeys just one rule: our love for motorcycles isn’t restricted to the road so give your helmet the place it deserves in your home.    Quality design, high speed and big icons like Steve McQueen and Paul Newman – this is how we envision the world of motorcycles.   Halley is made for the unwavering rider who embodies tenacity and freedom on and off the road; who appreciates the balance between a minimalistic aesthetic and a functional-orientated approach to design; a devoted rider who cares about the function of their kit.   Founded in Barcelona in 2017 to make timeless and innovative motorcycle accessories, Halley was born out of a willingness to never stop questioning and searching for new answers. A university project inspired our first product, the Halley Helmet Rack, which has been tweaked and perfected over the past year. We’re thrilled to start this new journey together – we hope you enjoy the ride.          For use with open and full face helmets          Easy to assemble in 5 minutes          Includes:  · 1- Helmet Rack body  · 2- Trim · 3- Stainless Steel Ball · 4- Wall plug x4 · 5- Screw x4 · 6- Washer x4 · 7- Technical Screw x2 · 8- Installation Instructions    Supporters of the Halley Kickstarter campaign can buy a custom designed motorbike vector file for a donation of their choice.

<p>My name is Marina, I am 25 and live in Melbourne, Australia.</p>
<p>My campaign here is to raise funding to bring to life a piece of technology from the fictional world of Star Trek. The Combadge.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The abilty to communicate with someone simply by pushing one single button brings 24th century technology here today.</p>
<p>With your contributions, my team and I aim to produce an operational prototype with the goal of putting the device into mass production.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Being that Star Trek is owned by CBS Television Studios and Viacom/Paramount Pictures, the initial prototype would have to be of an original design. But it is my intention to produce the prototype with the aim to allow licensing arrangements to be made from companies such as Viacom/Paramount that would enable me to mass produce a functional Star Trek Combadge. This will not only appeal to Trekkies as the small size of the technology allows me to licence this product to corporations such as Disney, Time Warner, DC and Marvel. This means under licensing agreements, I will be able to produce these Combadges in the form of a Mickey Mouse or Donald Duck badge, a Superman or Batman logo badge etc.. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: What's the point of a Combadge when almost everyone has a Mobile/Cell Phone these days?</p>
<p> A: Well, aside from the fact that another part of Star Trek technology will be brought out of the fictional world and into reality, a Combadge is communication at it's simplest.</p>
<p>These days, the vast majority of us carry around a smartphone. These are wonderful devices that are packed with many features.</p>
<p>The problem with all those features is that the smartphones main feature, telephony, takes a back seat.</p>
<p>How many times have you accidentally hung up on someone because your cheek or ear accidentally pressed disconnect? How many times have you been speaking to someone for a few minutes, telling them something important before you realise that what you just said to them wasn't heard because you had mute activated by mistake?</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>The answer to that question is simple.</p>
<p>A smartphones primary function is no longer to make a simple phone call.</p>
<p>It's the reason why people have and use both an iPhone and an iPod.</p>
<p>Sometimes you just want to listen to music.</p>
<p>Just like sometimes you just want to make a call.</p>
<p>This is where the Combadge comes into play.</p>
<p>No camera, no text, just pure and simple phone calls. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Combadge is also a parents best friend.</p>
<p>The Combadge will allow parents to program a selection of phone numbers into the device which the child will able to access and dial using voice activation.</p>
<p>Once programmed, the Combadge is secured to the child's clothing, and to contact any one of the pre-programmed numbers the child simple presses the Combadge and says the name of person they wish to call and within seconds, that person is talking to the Combadge wearer. For instance, the child presses the Combadge and says ""DAD"", The Combadge then calls DAD. </p>
<p>The Combadge will also contain a GPS which enables a parent to keep track of their childs whereabouts at any time of the day or night. This feature is invaluable as the childs exact location can be monitored by either an app or pc based program. </p>
<p>Another great reason is the kids won't lose their $200+ phone anymore.</p>
<p>No need for text messaging, big phone bills, or worrying that your child is wasting their life away on social media websites, as the child will only be able to call the numbers programmed into the Combadge.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: Why produce more than one variation of the Combadge?</p>
<p>A: Simply put, not everyone is a Star Trek Fan, and for this to be commercially viable, it must appeal to a broad range of potential customers.</p>
<p>To achieve this, I have estimated it will take about $100,000 to produce a prototype. Designing and producing the tech that makes it work is available now. To actually take it to the stage of mass production including the licensing agreements will cost a lot more, but by having the functional prototype, it allows investors to actually see what they can invest in.  </p>
<p>With your help, I can make this revolutionary communication device come to life.</p>
<p>Thanks for your support,</p>

<p>Smart Meters provide hourly data on your energy consumption, and about 1/3 of U.S. households now have a smart meter.  Utilities offer lower hourly rates at night when wind power is strongest, and higher rates during the day when natural gas plants are cranking up.  Therefore, the more wind power you use relative to fossil fuels, the more money you save.  It's easy to save 10% just by signing up and following our messaging on Facebook.  Users that install energy efficient appliances, solar, and charge their electric car at night have higher Wind Numbers.  The App is free, all you have to do is make informed purchasing decisions that improve your quality of life, lower your energy costs, and reduce your impact on the environment.</p>
<p>After years of development, I filed a provisional patent application on the Wind Number method of saving money on utility costs last year, concurrent with the creation of a prototype of the Green Button App with the help of a computer programmer.   During the Summer of 2014, I conducted a <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/windnumber"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">social game on Facebook</a>.  The marketing campaign focused on the San Francisco Bay Area, presented information on how to use more clean energy and save money, then people ran the program and posted their Wind Numbers on the Facebook page.  The User with the highest Wind Number each month won a box of LEDs.  Although a box of LEDs costs only $60, it can save more than $1,500 over a 20-25 year period, making it a compelling investment.  It also lowers carbon emissions!  Overall, Sabreez gave away about $10,000 in savings this Summer.  In summary, <i>People Like Winning</i>.</p>

<h2><strong>Laundry runs in the family</strong></h2>
<p><span>We're Equator Advanced Appliances, a small business that makes high-efficiency appliances, including washing machines. It was started in 1991 by entrepreneur, Atul Vir, when he pioneered Combo Washer-Dryers in the US market.

<h2><strong>Equator Hybrid</strong></h2>
<p>Atul pioneered the combo washer-dryer market in the US 18 years ago. These machines allowed one to put laundry in, press a button, and return a couple of hours later to clean clothes. In addition to the time saved by these front-load machines, they are also highly energy efficient and use 1/3 the water used by traditional top-loading machines.</p>
<p>The problem with front-load machines is that consumers must bend down to load and unload their laundry. We decided to tackle this issue by designing a machine that opens like a conventional top-loading washer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""Equator Hybrid"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i45.tinypic.com/fux5rm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><em>Equator Hybrid</em></p>
<p>What makes the Equator Hybrid unique is the horizontal-axis technology that uses a front-load design but enables it to be opened from the top, providing exceptional ease-of-use.</p>
<p>The research and development for this concept was done by a world-class American design team to better satisfy the needs of the busy American consumer. The result was 14 patents (10 for design and 4 for technology). In addition to being the first top-loading horizontal-axis machine with a one-touch opening mechanism, the Equator Hybrid will also include the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Size of a conventional washing machine (H40""x W27""x D28"")</li>
<li>Uses 220 volts, allowing less drying time</li>
<li>Capacity of 3.5 cubic feet, the size of a conventional washer</li>
<li>Touch screen controls with one-touch start </li>
<li>One button operation for loading access to the drum </li>
<li>Automatic water input depending on laundry weight </li>
<li>Automatic dry time and dry temperature </li>
<li>Pause/Add-a-sock feature </li>

There is adequate space for parts storage, assembly staging, testing, and packing. While some of the components will be manufactured in other plants, some of the components will be manufactured in-house. Much of the equipment is already in place.</span></p>

<p>The project will generate about 30 jobs in the first year. Particular attention will be paid to testing the product in order to ensure it has a robust feel to it. We believe that it will deserve the label “Made in America.”</p>

<p> </p>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p><span>The Equator Hybrid is no ordinary washing machine. It is designed to be the most advanced laundry appliance in the world and will have huge export potential, especially to Europe and Australia.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<h2><span>Risks and Challenges</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The main challenge in the Equator Hybrid project is putting all the moving parts of the project together.

In addition, there will be the challenge of getting manpower for the assembly of machines. We have anticipated this by situating the site in Schulenburg, where one can draw on employees with German heritage who are known for precision engineering.

Surrounded by smartphones, apps and video games, there’s been a quite an increase in behavioral issues. This isn’t just an idea. Just as the following references show, many studies, theories and modalities have been created to help children in this phenomenon. Practices such as meditation, concentration or therapy through play are being proposed to help our children attain a calmer, more natural state of being and to help manage their emotions.10 Tips to Increase Your Child's Concentration7 In-Class Activities to Improve Concentration in ChildrenHow to Practice ADHD Play Therapy at HomeRock Balancing Stone Stacking Art STEAM Activity for KidsHow Stacking / Nesting Toys Can Develop Early Language and Fine Motor SkillsThese techniques are really inspiring and we feel they should should be available to all children. And this is why we decided to create Piks.Avez-vous déjà remarqué que les enfants sont de moins en moins concentrés ? Puisque ce sujet devient chaque jour plus présent, nous avons décidé de créer un jouet qui permettra aux enfants de s’épanouir tout en se divertissant ! Tout comme le montrent les références ci-dessous, de nombreuses théories et pratiques améliorent la concentration, les capacités cognitives et favorisent le contrôle des émotions. Et ceci tout en plaçant nos enfants dans un environnement plus calme et naturel.Comment aider un enfant à se concentrer?Pourquoi jouer aide nos enfants à grandirArt-thérapie : la créativité au service des élèves perturbésÉduquer, c’est (aussi) jouerNous croyons que ces pratiques sont très inspirantes et qu'elles devraient être appliquées d’une manière ou d’une autre à tout les enfants. Et c'est pourquoi nous avons décidé de créer Piks. The aim of the Piks game is simple - to create the most original and impressive structure by positioning all of the pieces without any of it falling down.  By playing with Piks, children explore the intricacies of balance while decision-making, motor skills and imagination all come into play transforming the players into artists in a performance of concentration and skill.Le but du jeu est simple : créer la structure la plus originale et impressionnante sans laisser tomber aucune pièce  ! La prise de décision, la motricité fine et l'imagination transformeront les joueurs en de véritables artistes en pleine performance de concentration. Because we take playing seriously, this isn’t just a toy! Carefully designed, Piks offers many great educational skills and benefits for kids. Parce que s’amuser sainement est un thème sérieux pour nous, Piks n’est pas un jouet comme un autre. Conçu avec soin, Piks développe de nombreuses compétences pédagogiques et présente de nombreux avantages pour les enfants.Because of our commitment to offer a toy that develops concentration skills, we decided to seek inspiration and direction from the field of education, more precisely from research on kids' concentration disorders.  Why are we inspired by education and behaviors issues ?Toys are the first objects that our kids have in their hands so they provide an immense opportunity for development through fun. Our belief is that these objects should convey important values and skills and be conceived using the best educational knowledge possible. To do this, we truly believe that dialogue between the fields of design and education is mandatory.Du fait de nos valeurs et notre engagement à développer des compétences de concentration, nous avons décidé de nous inspirer du domaine de l'éducation et plus précisément des recherches et des solutions alternatives aux troubles de l'attention et de la concentration. Pourquoi sommes-nous inspirés par l'éducation et par des troubles de comportements ?Les jouets sont les premiers objets que nos enfants reçoivent entre leurs mains. Nous croyons que ces objets doivent véhiculer des valeurs importantes et doivent être conçus de la manière la plus éducative possible. De ce fait, nous croyons fortement que le lien entre le domaine du design et de l’éducation est important. Our goal is to send you all Piks by March 2019 so all can enjoy the toy and its valuable benefits in the coming year!  Check out our rewards below and support our project Piks and our brand O P P I ®.Thank you so much for your support!Notre objectif est de vous envoyer Piks au mois de Février 2019 afin que nous puissions tous profiter du jouet et de ses précieux avantages en 2019 ! Découvrez nos contreparties ci-dessous et soutenez Piks et notre marque O P P I ®.Merci beaucoup pour votre soutien !Based in France and co-founded by two brothers, O P P I ® is the result of Hansel Schloupt’s passion for product design, toys and education; and the in-depth knowledge of production of his brother, Bastien Schloupt. After suffering from an undiagnosable illness for 10 years, Hansel was finally cured in the city of Barcelona, Spain. He then decided to study industrial design there at ELISAVA School of Design. Inspired by his own health experience, he was quickly interested in the fusion between design and human behavior. He explored his interest further at ECAL/Cantonal Art School in Lausanne Switzerland, obtaining a Product Design Master. After several years of practical experience, his projects led him to the topic of therapy and fun and from there he found his true passion - designing educational toys based psychological/educational insights.After receiving different awards including the Core 77 Design Awards 2013 or the IKEA Swiss Foundation Award 2016, Hansel and his brother, Bastien, decided to create O P P I ® together.Basé en France et co-fondé par deux frères, O P P I ® est le fruit de la passion de Hansel Schloupt pour la conception de produits, des jouets et de l'éducation ; et de la forte connaissance de production de son frère Bastien Schloupt.  Suite à 10 années de lutte contre une maladie orpheline, Hansel a eu la chance d'être guéri dans la ville de Barcelone et a décidé d'étudier le Design Industriel à l'école de design ELISAVA. Inspiré par son expérience personnelle, il s'intéresse très vite à la fusion entre le design et les comportements humains et explore ses intérêts au cours d'un Master de Design Produit à l'ECAL / École Cantonale d'Art de Lausanne en Suisse. Après plusieurs années de pratique, ses recherches et ses projets l'ont amené à aborder le sujet de la thérapie et du jeu, pour ainsi trouver une passion pour la conception de jouets éducatifs. Après avoir reçu différents prix, dont le Core 77 Design Awards 2013 ou le soutien de la Bourse IKEA Swiss Foundation 2016, Hansel s'entoure de son frère Bastien, avec qui il créé O P P I ®.Do you like Piks?

I'm George Biasco. I and my team are  Social Innovator.         


The
 social innovator is a new figure  highly 
specialized that was created to bring and sensitize the society to the issues of environment, energy,
 health and digital communication. The basis for the specialization of each innovator is the research and
 development of innovative prototypes that can best safeguard today's 
society without compromising the future of his children. So, we thought MGT (MacGyverTools). MgT is a small, lightweight and portable smart screwdriver. This screwdriver is obtained from the RECYCLED ALUMINIUM that you normally buy at hardware stores. 
The idea of ​​the tools is to sensitize people to respect the environment with the recycling of aluminum by joining something that is useful to your own lifestyle and your character. We thought associate a MGT a color to represent our personality, our character.


SILVER.
Represent: silver is respectable and courteous, mature and determined, wise and organized. It reflects back the energy sent out, whether that energy is positive or negative. Silver opens the mind and lights the way forward
                         
BLUE. 
Represent: Intelligence, communication, trust, efficiency, serenity, duty, logic, coolness, reflection. Blue is the colour of the mind and is essentially soothing. Consequently it is serene and mentally calming. It is the colour of clear communication. Blue is the world's favourite colour.                             
GREEN. Raprensent: Harmony, balance, refreshment, universal love, rest, restoration, reassurance, environmental awareness, equilibrium, peace. Green strikes the eye in such a way as to require no adjustment whatever and is, therefore, restful. It is the colour of balance.                                         

RED.
Represent: Physical courage, strength, warmth, energy, basic survival, 'fight or flight', stimulation, masculinity, excitement. Its effect is physical, it stimulates us and raises the pulse rate, giving the impression that time is passing faster than it is. It is stimulating and lively, very friendly.                                          
MGT was born because I am a heedless person. Often when I go to do the repairs I forget my screwdrivers. Today I have not this problem because the screwdrivers with MGT are always with me.


Yes, A small aluminum keychain, very light (only 30g x 2.7"" of lenght and 0.5 "" width )

<p>Welcome to Chicago Brew - a North Chicago coffee shop with a diverse cast of characters, both customers and staff alike. If you spend just an hour in any Starbucks you’ll agree the potential story lines are virtually endless. In fact, the inspiration for Chicago Brew comes from nearly 7 years of combined experiences Executive Producer Glenn Selby and Co-creator Andrew Voigt have had actually working at Starbucks. Chicago brew is like many time-tested, work-place sitcoms - Taxi, Cheers, The Mary-Tyler Moore Show, WKRP in Cincinnati - and many more. Chicago Brew is next in line for this legacy.</p>

<p>We want to share with you our vision to bring Chicago Brew to network television.</p>
<p>The script for the pilot is complete and we plan to pitch it at the October New York TV Festival. We want to take advantage of every networking opportunity available. With that in mind we are producing a sizzle reel, a DEMO if you will. This is simply a shorter version of the pilot we can use to generate interest at the festival and open even more doors. To do this we need to raise $18,900. Why $18,900? We realize if we want to be taken seriously by the networks, we need to play on their level. To do that, the sizzle reel must be a quality production. To produce a quality production we must hire quality people, which mean actors, crew, and all the logistical support to pull it off. Chicago Brew is NOT an experiment, we believe <strong>it’s the next Classic Television Comedy</strong>. So please consider helping us make this a reality.</p>

<h3>
<br/><strong>FAQ</strong>
</h3>
<p><strong>PRODUCT USAGE - Can we use tea bags/loose leaf tea/other ingredients?</strong></p>
<p>Certainly! For small pieces of tea like fannings and dust grade, we strongly suggest placing them in tea filtered bag before brewing them in your Qi Aerista. You are welcome to put your favourite spices when you want to brew your chai. However, we suggest to run a brewing cycle (e.g. 2-3 mins) with just water first after each brew of strong flavored tea. If that does not satisfy you, then add a little vinegar to run the brew with water.</p>
<p><strong>PRODUCT USAGE - How much tea leaves/water can I add?</strong></p>
<p>We recommend using  one heaped teaspoon (about 3 grams) for every 250ml (about 8oz) of water.</p>
<p><strong>PRODUCT USAGE - What kind of water should I use?</strong></p>
<p>Most of your cup of tea consists of water, therefore, choosing the right kind of water is a key step to brew a perfect cup of tea. Avoid choosing water that is high in mineral contents as you may find unwanted metallic flavour in your tea.  Also, if the water’s mineral content is too high it will leave scale deposits in your pot. Absolutely purified water is also not recommended as it will make the tea flat and dull. As a result, we advise using clean drinking water that has either low or balanced mineral content.</p>
<p><strong>PRODUCT USAGE - Can we use Qi Aerista just to boil/heat the water?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, once the infuser is removed from Qi Aerista, it will turn into variable temperature kettle mode. Via our app, you can set the temperature to boiling or to other temperatures between 20C to 100C (68F to 212F) you like.</p>
<p><strong>PRODUCT USAGE - How do we make milk tea with Qi Aerista? Can I add milk directly?</strong></p>
<p>We recommend using Qi Aerista to make the base tea, then mix with milk and other ingredients (e.g. sugar) in an external container (e.g. mug). We don't recommend directly adding milk inside your Qi Aerista.</p>
<p><strong>PRODUCT USAGE - How do we clean it?</strong></p>
<p>All parts in contact with water (e.g. infuser and pot) can be removed for cleaning or rinsed under the tap.</p>
<p><strong>TECHNICAL ASPECTS - Can we replace the glass pot?</strong></p>
<p>Currently, we do not offer replacement for the glass pot.</p>
<p><strong>TECHNICAL ASPECTS - How does the Wi-Fi work and what kind of access it needs?</strong></p>
<p>You can link the app to Qi Aerista through a direct Wi-Fi connection (i.e. no Wi-Fi network needed). Basically look up the list of Wi-Fi networks to connect to (say Qi-Aerista-123 in SSID) on your smartphone and enter the corresponding password to connect. The exact procedures will be outlined when our product is ready to ship.</p>
<p><strong>TECHNICAL ASPECTS - </strong><strong>How far can Qi Aerista be from our smartphone?</strong></p>
<p>Similar to the other Wi-Fi devices depending on the home's interior design.</p>
<p><strong>TECHNICAL ASPECTS - </strong><strong>What voltage and power plugs does it have and use?</strong></p>
<p>We are offering two versions initially: 220V+UK plug and 110V+US plug. So if you live in a place that uses neither of these plug types, then you will need an earthed adaptor that can safely support 1000W (e.g. 10A current for 220V).</p>
<p><strong>TECHNICAL ASPECTS - </strong><strong>Does it have a warranty? Can we replace different pieces of it if one was broken?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Qi Aerista comes with 1-year limited warranty from the date of delivery that would cover the repairs, replacement or refund of our product due to a defect in product material or its workmanship within the warranty period. Terms and conditions apply, including the product should be used in a manner that is consistent with the user manual. Details of the warranty claim arrangement with our agents and partners in your local jurisdiction will be provided at the time of shipping.</p>
<p><strong>TECHNICAL ASPECTS - </strong><strong>Do we have to use the app in order to brew tea?</strong></p>
<p>No. You don’t have to use the app. The app is available to provide you with more great features like customizing your brewing temperature and time. If you are happy with our preset temperature and time for your favourite tea type, then just use Qi Aerista as a one-button press tea brewer.</p>
<p><strong>TECHNICAL ASPECTS - </strong><strong>What’s the standby and timer set power?</strong></p>
<p>Standby power is less than 0.5W. For timer set, power is about 1W.</p>
<p><strong>SHIPPING - How is the shipping handled and how much does it cost?</strong></p>
<p>International shipping dates may vary. For single-unit shipping to Hong Kong, add $10. For shipping to other countries, including mainland China, add $20. Note that backer will be liable for any tax or import duties that you may be required to pay upon importing your reward into your country.</p>
<p><strong>SHIPPING - </strong><strong>We live outside of Hong Kong. Can we still pre-order?</strong></p>
<p>Certainly. Qi Aerista ships anywhere in the world.</p>
<p><strong>SHIPPING - </strong><strong>Do we add the shipping fee to the pledge amount or is it charged later?</strong></p>
<p>The shipping fee will be added to your pledge amount based on the shipping address you choose and you’ll be charged once you confirm payment.</p>
<p><strong>SHIPPING - </strong><strong>How can we confirm the shipping address?</strong></p>
<p>Our shipping address will be confirmed right before we are ready to ship. So no worries if you have a change in shipping address in the meantime.</p>

<h3>OK, That sounds awesome. But why?</h3>
<p>We love the Aeropress® coffee maker; it's been in our families morning routine for many years. If you own one, you've almost definitely encountered that moment when you've made a coffee for a friend or partner, and then you've got to re-do the whole process for yourself before you can enjoy them together; with the 2POUR®, you no longer have that problem.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531817054/ipvojbl0rcfmpesdnjxp.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>Features of the 2POUR</h3>
<p><strong>Reusable</strong>. We believe in buying once, buying better. That doesn't mean it has to be expensive either; we are committed to ensuring everything we design is made to last and at an affordable cost for all. The 2POUR® has been designed to last a long time - meaning you'll only ever have to buy one, that is, unless you're buying one for a friend too.</p>
<p><strong>Washable</strong>. We designed the 2POUR® not only for a great coffee brewing experience but we also made it super easy to clean. The product is a single-unit design with no removable parts, resulting in a quick and easy cleaning experience with most household cleaning cloths. </p>
<p><strong>Easy to use</strong>. The Aeropress® is one of the easiest products we've ever used to make coffee and the 2POUR® is no different. It was really important for us to design the 2POUR® so that when combined with the Aeropress® it has little to no impact on the original brewing experience; meaning, 'less fussing, more sipping! - but this time, with friends!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531817161/v6v4qohkqiq5s8dl85c4.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Design</h3>
<p>When designing the 2POUR® our main goal was to ensure that it remained in line with the same principles of the Aeropress® coffee maker; harvesting smooth, rich coffee in just a few minutes. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531817203/tikypgmkaq5pd4lpy773.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>

</div></div>","OK, That sounds awesome. But why?
We love the Aeropress® coffee maker; it's been in our families morning routine for many years. If you own one, you've almost definitely encountered that moment when you've made a coffee for a friend or partner, and then you've got to re-do the whole process for yourself before you can enjoy them together; with the 2POUR®, you no longer have that problem.  
 

 

Features of the 2POUR
Reusable. We believe in buying once, buying better. That doesn't mean it has to be expensive either; we are committed to ensuring everything we design is made to last and at an affordable cost for all. The 2POUR® has been designed to last a long time - meaning you'll only ever have to buy one, that is, unless you're buying one for a friend too.
Washable. We designed the 2POUR® not only for a great coffee brewing experience but we also made it super easy to clean. The product is a single-unit design with no removable parts, resulting in a quick and easy cleaning experience with most household cleaning cloths. 
Easy to use. The Aeropress® is one of the easiest products we've ever used to make coffee and the 2POUR® is no different. It was really important for us to design the 2POUR® so that when combined with the Aeropress® it has little to no impact on the original brewing experience; meaning, 'less fussing, more sipping! - but this time, with friends!
 

 
Design
When designing the 2POUR® our main goal was to ensure that it remained in line with the same principles of the Aeropress® coffee maker; harvesting smooth, rich coffee in just a few minutes. 
 

 
We've taken very subtle design influences from both the portafilter (used on commercial coffee machines) and the Chemex style pour-over brewer - resulting in a new, but familiar 2POUR® which is equally at home on your countertop. 
 

 
As we've already mentioned, using the 2POUR® impacts on your Aeropress® routine very little and requires minimal setup; all you need to do is put your Aeropress® on top, it's that easy!

The stick packaging is also new to detergents and therefore requires the research and creation of new packaging that will not react with the detergent itself. However, our Smacle team has been working diligently over the past year to create stable packaging for transport and moisture exposure using trial and error as well as altering the shape of the crystals used in Smacle to minimize the chance of reducing the effectiveness of Smacle after being transported. In addition, using natural extracts as previously mentioned, in addition to orange, coconut extracts, etc. we ensure and have received certified test report and patents that our products' cleaning effectiveness is same, if not better, than conventional detergents. To address the stick packaging issues, we have equipped our own facilities to be able to create our own packaging, ruling out any issues with outsourcing a crucial part of our product delivery. Our team guarantees that Smacle will be everything it's expected to be and will ensure proper delivery of Smacle to all of our backers.</b></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1425192/files/20150429051441-20.png?1430309681"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>How much can one stick of Smacle handle?</b><br/></p><p>- For a standard drum/front loading machine, 1 stick of Smacle can handle a 10kg load. If larger than 10kg, then 2 sticks can be used. If the 10kg machine is not full, then only half of a stick is needed and the rest can be saved for later use. For standard/top loading machines, a 100 liter machine that's full should use 2 sticks, an 80 liter machine will take 1 stick, and lower capacity machines (50 liters) should only take 1/2. If you hand wash your laundry, a 5 liter load will only need 1/4 of a stick and should only soaked for 30 minutes. Smacle works will with any washing mchine. <br/></p><p><b>What if I want to use less than 1 stick?</b><br/></p><p>- In the case where you have a small load of laundry, simply fold, clamp, tape, the   end of the stick and use it next time. <br/></p><p><b>Storage Conditions</b><br/></p><p>- Because our product is sensitive to moisture, it is important to keep Smacle's exposure to moisture or humidity minimized. Please keep away from direct sunlight and extreme temepratures and keep indoors. Please keep out of children's reach. <br/></p><p><b>Can the package be recycle?</b><br/></p><p>- Yes, the packaging is recyclable. It falls under the same category as plastic bags, etc. <br/></p><p><b>How much do I save by using Smacle?</b><br/></p><p>- A standard load of laundry using a 10kg machine uses anywhere between 40g-80g of detergent. With Smacle you only need about half and in some cases, only a quarter. <br/></p><p><b>How much is a spoonful?</b><br/></p><p>- A measuring spoon will equal about 20g, which is the same amount as a Smacle stick.<br/></p><p><b>Isn't there any residual detergen when using cold water?</b><br/></p><p>- There is absolutely no soap residue left even when using cold water, but will take longer to dissolve than when using hot warmer. As long as the amount of water is enough to dissolve Smacle, then it will completely dissolve. <br/></p><p><b>Is there any bleach or fabric softener?</b><br/></p><p>- Smacle is different from standard alkaline detergents and is mild enough where where a separate fabric softener is not needed. However, if you wish to use a particular scented softener, then that is up to you. We are currently developing a new product to replace the need for bleach. <br/></p><p><b>Is there any risk of color bleeding (dye transfer)?</b><br/></p><p>- Color bleeding will not occur. As long as the garment label does not contain any   special instruction for washing, then there is nothing to worry about. <br/></p><p><b>How do I prevent moisture exposure? What do I do if this happens?</b><br/></p><p>- Once the product has been opened and used, attention must be paid to sealing the product again in between uses. If possible, transferring the contents to a sealed container will be helpful. <br/></p><p><b>How effective is the foaming feature?</b><br/></p><p>- The combination of water and Smacle creates a super effective foaming solution that removes the hidden dirty in your clothing using ultra fine bubble and ultrasound techniques. Also, this removes any detergent residue to protect your skin and reduce pollution. <br/></p><p><b>Can Smacle can be placed together with clothing in the machine?</b><br/></p><p>- Yes, Smacle can be poured directly into the machine.

Also, since there are no hazardous materials in our detergent, Smacle will prevent any damage to the interior/exterior of your machine.Sparkling TechnologyWith Smacle's countless foam generated bubbles, when the bubbles come in contact with the fabric's cells, a reacion occurs that destroys dirt and other contanimating items. This action promotes  a chemical reaction in the detergent that increases the dispersion effect and dirt and any unseeable foreign matter attached to the cloth is washed out completely. Just like the invention of liquid detergent and its innovation into the the detergent industry with its unparred emulsifying power for washing clothes, Smacle is the first in the world of its kind and will revolutionize the detergent industry.Using less than 1/2 the amount of traditional detergent, Smacle generates more cleaning agents and bubbles to demonstrate its outstanding capability for washing large loads of laundy while using less detergent.The human ear can only process certain wavelengths of ultrasound (16Hz~20kHz?). Most people will have seen glasses cleaners of ultrasound machines used for pregnancy. The reason that ultrasound waves are used for cleaning is because ultrasound waves generated in the water has the ability to remove objects that are stuck to the surface of an obect.INNOVATION OF DETERGENT!Smacle is the world's first detergent to use ultrasonic cleaning technology. Most ultrasonic cleaners out there require the use of a separate machine or device in order to do so. Smacle is an ultrasonic cleaner that doesn't need a separate device and is all combined into our ultrasonic detergent.Detergent has been a neccesity in our lives for decades, especially in powder form > the only change has been the addition in liquit detergent. In addition, the reality is that detergents can have an adverse effect on the environment or personal health. Can we solve these problems? Is their a way to overcome? These are the questions that Smacle was developed to address. Ultrasonic cleaners were the first thing we thing we discovered in our research to address these issues while reducing the amount of detergent used to lean. For 13 month, the efforts of our team were combined to create an effective foaming agent that would clean fabric effectively while being harmless to the fabric and to us.Smacle is an environmental research and development company that specializes life-friendly products. Our vision is the realization of creative ideas that benefit both people and the planet.Smacle's name come from the derivtaion of Smart & Cleaner. Being a smart detergent means, unlike conventional detergents, Smacle does not use any hazardous materials and uses the least amount of chemical surfactants as possible. Smacle uses extracted ingredients from plants, fruits, etc. producuring the safest detergent possible. By reducing the amount of hazardous materials and chemical surfactants, Smacle maximizes the safety to people and the environment. Also, it reduces the amount of land and water contamination by reducing the amount of overall detergent you use. Smacle's strong point is that by using our detergent, you're watching out for the health of your family as well as helping protect the environment.

Hi-Seoul Brand company, Lightors has received recognition for being a promising and representative small-medium enterprise by the city of Seoul.Only those companies that offer globally competitive innovative technological products are able to receive this special recognition in hopes of expanding Korea's domestic export enterprise.Smacle greatest feature is that it's a foaming detergent that is 100% water soluble.

<p>My name is Sonya Spagnola-Lee. I am the founder and creator of Scratch Fresh Foods Inc. and mother of 3 amazing children! I created Scratch Fresh Foods because I found there was a need for healthy alternatives to snacking and fast foods. Everything we make is made from scratch, using locally sourced ingredients.  I founded this company just over a year ago after taking some business classes with the Toronto Business Development Centre. I quickly found my location and set to work.</p>
<p>After a little while, my advisor came to see me and asked me if I would be interested in renting out some of my space to someone who was also getting started in the food business. Since I had a huge amount of space and only required a very little bit of it, I thought sure, why not.</p>
<p>And so it began! That was the start of The Scratch Kitchen. Since that very first client, I have fallen in love with being able to help others start their dreams.  As more people became interested in my space, I would add more equipment.  I was a single mom who was solely responsible for caring for 3 children, so the idea of going into debt and perhaps failing was a big scare for me. I added to the kitchen as I could afford to, using what little I had in my savings, finding the best deals possible, even if that meant 3 days of cleaning and scrubbing the 40 year old convection oven I purchased used.(yes, I litterally scrubbed that oven for 3 days...but now she looks brand new and works like a beast!)</p>
<p>Things had been going great. In our first 5 months, we helped two businesses grow and launch into their own locations. I had a steady stream of clients and things were great.</p>
<p>In hind sight, I should have stuck to my plan.  Save and buy, save and buy.  In January I made a deal with a new client. I thought it was a good deal(I can always see the positive in everything). I rented space to a cclient at a reduced rate, in return they would put bigger and better equipment into the kitchen for all of my clients to use. This would mean better production, faster production time, better quality etc etc. It seemed easy enough, fair enough.  We had the agreement that should either party become unhappy then we would give the other party 6 month’s notice. I felt would be a fair amount of time to replace the equipment or buy it from them should they leave.</p>
<h3>Why Things Are Never As Good As They Seem....</h3>
<p>On June 4<sup>th</sup> I received an email informing me that my client would be ending their contract and withdrawing all of their equipment by the end of the month. There was no negotiating, no conversation, no warnings. No offers to buy equipment. No professionalism. I did my best to try to negotiate with them.There were plenty of lies.</p>
<p>On June 30<sup>th</sup>, with no notice and a Police escort by their side, I was forced to stand by and watch as they not only ripped apart my dreams and all I had worked so hard for, but the dreams of each one of my clients. How could we continue with no stove, no hood vent? I begged for them to at least leave the hood vent and I would pay for it. I was laughed at. </p>
<p>Since that day, I have not been able to get them to honour their agreement and fix the damages they caused. The back door alone is damaged in excess of $700.  I have taken on a second full time job in a factory, hoping that the $13.00 an hour I make will somehow add up to enough to replace the equipment. I have lost 3 of my clients because there is nothing for them to work on. And I am in very close danger of just closing down the doors altogether.</p>
<p>In my life, I can honestly say that I have always done what I could to help someone out. I have given away free kitchen time at my expense to help a new business launch. I have always given my time and knowledge free to help others get on their feet. I would never consider even for a second to treat someone so badly, to rip apart everything they have worked so hard for. I guess that’s why I was so blind-sided by this. I have a girlfriend who says I am not “city” enough. I don’t want to believe that I have to be hard and cold. There are good people out there. I have seen them and met them.</p>
<h3>Why We Need Your Support Today...</h3>
<p>I have never had to ask anyone for help before. It is a difficult thing to do, I’ll admit, much tougher than I thought. I much prefer to be the one helping others.</p>
<p>Today I must give up a little of my pride, be a little embarrassed, and ask for your support. Not just to save my business for me, but to help me save my kitchen for everyone who works there. I have great clients who don’t deserve to lose out in their business because of a mistake I made. Finding commercial kitchen space in Toronto is a very difficult thing to do. Even though I still feel very sad and hurt by the actions of my client, I know there are still good people out there worth helping.</p>
<p>With your support, The Scratch Kitchen needs to raise $15 000. We need to replace the hood vent and fire suppression system that was removed. This is the most important use of our funds. On average, the cost for a hood system runs at $1000 per foot. We need to replace at minimum, an 8 foot hood. We also need to replace our gas range. Used, we have been able to find a good one for $1000. We would need to pick it up and also have it installed, which will also run $1000 as the client had my gas line removed with his equipment and refuses to put it back.  If we had funds left from that, a walk in cooler is next on the list to be replaced. We currently had a commercial 2 door cooler, but have a difficult time sharing a small space with so many people.</p>
<p>We aren’t looking for the best, most expensive equipment. We just need to find equipment that will allow us to survive. That will allow us to use the funds in the best possible way so we can all continue our businesses and grow! </p>
<p>If we don't get the full amount asked for, then we will use whatever funds we get to first go towards a new hood vent and fire supression system. Without that, we are nothing. </p>

<h1 style=""text-align: center;"">Octave Light R1</h1>
<h4 style=""text-align: center;"">the Highest Precision and the Most Dependable 3D Printer with an affordable price</h4>
Every 3D Printer enthusiast knows that top-down style
stereolithography is great. The Top-down with Recoater blade
method is what have been used in industrial-scale
stereolithography machines for more than 20 years. It is proven
and trusted. <br/>
<br/>
Yet, nobody knows how to manufacture an accurate top-down 3D
Printer with an affordable price. But things are OK now, because
the Octave Light R1 DLP Desktop 3D Printer is here to show people
how it is done. <br/>
<br/>
This is the pre-sales of the Octave Light R1, the highest
precision and the most dependable 3D Printer with an affordable
price. The objects printed by the Octave Light R1 are so accurate
that you can see the imprint of each individual DLP pixels when
inspecting the printed objects under a microscope. The 365 nm
versions of the R1 is also the first affordable 3D Printer in the
world with a 365 nm LED light source, which used to be only
available in industrial scale stereolithography machines. <br/>
<br/>
All orders will be delivered, even if our Indiegogo Flexible
Funding goal were not reached. I own the Octave Light company and I own its small factory, so I can personally promise you that your order will be
delivered, with high quality. The R1 will help you turn your
inspirations into reality. <br/>
<br/>
Since our first public announcement one month ago on 15th
February, 2016, we are already featured on two of the most
prominent 3D Printing online magazines: <br/>

The pre-sales orders received from this Indiegogo campaign will be
shipped out of our factory starting 31st May, 2016. Why we can
deliver so fast? It is because we already have 11 full-time staffs
worked for 10 months on the Octave Light project; all major
manufacturing equipments are already installed; and the engineering
of the R1 is already in mass production stage. <br/>
<br/>
Hi, I am Charles Lo. It is my personal goal to engineer,
manufacture, and deliver the best 3D Printer to every family
on this planet. I am so committed to this mission I have already
invested my whole saving bank account into the Octave Light project.

<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://octavelight.com/static/indiegogo2016/charles-lo.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>
<br/>
Why the Octave Light R1 is the highest precision and the most
dependable desktop 3D Printer with an affordable price? Please see
the reasons below. <br/>
<br/>
<hr/>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Laser Measured Precision</h2>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://octavelight.com/static/indiegogo2016/laser.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>
The Octave Light R1 features a Laser Measurement Sensor, that has a
resolution of 3 μm. 3 μm is less then the radius of a red blood
cell. The red dot you see on the resin in the photo above is the
laser. The rectangular and stylish box above the red dot is the
Sensor. <br/>
<br/>
This is the exact same Laser Measurement Sensor that is used in
silicon wafer manufacturing machines, in the semi-conductor industry
right now. When I say the R1 uses industrial grade components, I am
being serious. <br/>
<br/>
Why a Laser Measurement Sensor is essential for accuracy? It is
because when you put objects inside and under the resin surface, the
resin surface rises; and when you take objects out of the resin, the
resin surface lowers. <br/>
<br/>
All other affordable Top-down 3D Printers in the market today do not
know how to correctly solve their Z axis direction inaccuracy
problem, because of the rising and lowering of the resin surface. They
are out of control on how tall their printed objects actually are. <br/>
<br/>
The Octave Light R1 is the only affordable Top-down 3D Printer that
has Z axis precision! For each layer that we print, we are using the
Laser Measurement Sensor to determine the exact location of our
resin surface in real time, while we are vertically adjusting our
build platform. Therefore, the height of our printed objects are
always accurate, and all layers are always equally thin. <br/>
<br/>
All other affordable Top-down 3D Printers in the market today also
have the problem of having their projected image out of focus,
because of the varying location of the resin surface. So their
projected image is blurry. And their printed objects are deformed in
the X direction and Y direction. <br/>
<br/>
The Octave Light R1 is the only affordable Top-down 3D Printer that
can keep its projected image in shape focus. For each layer that we
print, after we have determined the exact location of our resin
surface with our Sensor, we move our Optical Engine vertically to
make sure that the focal plane always land on the resin surface.
When you inspect our printed objects, you will see our focus is so
accurate that each individual pixel of our Optical Engine is sharply
imprinted on the objects. <br/>
<br/>
Further, our Sensor is able to measure the top surface of
transparent resins. That's an astounding achievement, if you ask any
laser sensor engineer. So, the Octave Light R1 is compatible with
transparent and semi-transparent resins. <br/>
<br/>
Before we go to the next point, let's enjoy this photo of a
cathedral, two castable patterns of multi-stone rings, our logo, a
sphere, and various other interesting objects. They are all printed
simultaneously by the Octave Light R1 at 25 µm per layer. A normal
piece of letter paper is 100 µm thick. 25 µm is one quarter the
thickness of a piece of paper here. <br/>
<br/>
This 25 μm per layer performance of the Octave Light R1 is matching any industrial-scale Stereolithography machines. We are putting the precision and dependably of true industrial-level machines, right onto your desktop. Think of the implications of that! <br/>
<br/>
These printed objects are still attached to the build plate. We took the whole plate of objects
directly out of the R1, rinsed them with isopropyl alcohol, and put
them straight in front of a camera for you to see. No supporting rods
were added or removed. It was printed just this way. <br/>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://octavelight.com/static/indiegogo2016/cathedral-yard.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>
<br/>
The next photo is the angel on top of the cathedral. All details are
printed perfectly.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Ultraviolet LED runs cool</h2>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://octavelight.com/static/indiegogo2016/r1-led.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>
The light source of the Octave Light R1 is a powerful ultraviolet
LED, which has a long lifetime and is energy efficient. The Octave
Light R1 only turns on the ultraviolet LED right before each
exposure and immediately turns off the ultraviolet LED after each
exposure. The ultraviolet LED is off most of the time, when there is
no resin exposure to do. This further prolongs the already long
lifetime of the ultraviolet LED and the digital micro mirrors. The
Octave Light R1 is the first affordable 3D Printer to turn off its
ultraviolet LED during the time in between each exposures. <br/>
<br/>
The 365 nm LED version of the Octave Light R1 is the first
affordable 3D Printer to offer a 365 nm light source, which was
traditionally only used in industrial Stereolithography machines. <br/>
<br/>
Why our 365 nm light source is a groundbreaking feature for the whole affordable market? It is
because the majority of useful and advanced resin chemistries
only works with a true Ultraviolet light in the 365 nm range. With
our 365 nm LED, you are opened to a wide wide ranged of existing,
proven, and advanced stereolithography material selections! <br/>
<br/>
If you have any medical, dental, or orthodontic certified resins
that can only be printed with the 365 nm wavelength area (hint: <a href=""http://www.dsm.com/content/dam/dsm/somos/en_US/documents/Brand-Status-Product-Datasheets/US%20English%20-%20A4/Somos%20BioClear%20Datasheet%20-%20US%20English%20A4.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">
DSM
Somos BioClear is ISO 10993-5, ISO 10993-10, and USP VI certified.</a>), 
then the Octave Light R1 365nm is for you. The Octave Light R1 365nm 
is especially attractive to orthodontist who want to bring their 
previously out-sourced 3D Printing in-house, onto their own desktop. <br/>
<br/>
If you have any existing and traditional industrial grade
stereolithography resins (hint: <a href=""https://www.dsm.com/content/dam/dsm/somos/en_US/documents/selector-guide-letter-print-0412.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">all of those DSM Somos resins
engineered for 355nm Solid State Lasers</a>), that have specific
mechanical properties or transparency properties you want, and those
existing resins are only sensitive to the 365 nm wavelength area,
then Octave Light R1 365nm can get the job done. <br/>
<br/>
Before we go to the next point, let's enjoy this Octave Light R1 print out at 1:1 scale of an orthodontic 3D scan. We are again printing at the finest setting of 25 µm layer thickness. The orthodontic model in the two photos below is still attached to the build plate. As always, we took it straight out of the R1, rinsed it with isopropyl alcohol, and put it directly in front of a camera for you to see. <br/>
<br/>
Doctors can use the Octave Light R1 to print out models of internal organs and structures from the 3D data of medical scanners. These 3D printed highly detailed and accurate physical models are particularly valuable for surgical planning. <br/>
<br/>
To push the boundary of technology further, doctors and dentists can digitally model surgical guides by referencing 3D scanned data, and then print out the surgical guides with medically certified resins. This will help the whole world perform surgeries in a even more precise and efficient way. Imagine, the day when every hospital in this world can easily effort their own high precision 3D Printer. Today is the day with the Octave Light R1. <br/>
<br/>
Orthodontists can use the Octave Light R1 to put their intraoral scanners to good use, by printing out orthodontic models directly on their own desktop, in their own office. <br/>
<br/>
Medial devices can be quickly tailor made, by trained medical professionals, with the Octave Light R1. The latest scientific discoveries and the newest technologies can be easily transformed into functional prototypes, with the Octave Light R1. <br/>
<br/>
This print out of a jaw of teeth excites not only orthodontist, dentist, and doctors. If you are a 3D artist, you can see how the Octave Light R1 correctly prints out the organic texture of the teeth and the gum. If you can digitally 3D sculpt the texture, we can print it out.<br/>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Custom Ultraviolet Optics with <br/>Direct Light Path</h2>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://octavelight.com/static/indiegogo2016/optical-engine.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>
The Octave Light R1 is the only DLP 3D Printer in the affordable
market today, that offers both a UV LED light source and a more than
two millions pixels industrial-stereolithography-grade optical
engine. <br/>
<br/>
The majority of affordable DLP 3D Printers today (e.g., the
previous-market-leader B9 Creator) contain a consumer-grade
entertainment-level projector and use a projector light bulb as
their light source. Those projector light bulbs have short lifetime,
are energy inefficient, produce a lot of heat, and are needed to be
replaced frequently. Those cheap projectors they use were designed
and intended for movies playing and office presentation. Those
projectors were engineered to project a visual (non-ultraviolet)
colorful image a few meters away on a white wall. Those projectors
are simply inaccurate when being modified into a DLP 3D Printer,
resulting in their distorted images and their distorted prints. <br/>
<br/>
Some newer entries (for examples, Ember, MoonRay, M-Jewelry) into
the affordable DLP 3D Printers market tell you that they use an UV
LED Light Engine. What they did not tell you is that, their 405 nm
light engine contains a low end digital-micro-mirror array. Their
digital-micro-mirror array has only 912 X 1140 pixels. (That's about
1 million pixels) And those pixels are in diamond shape for cost
saving reasons. Diamond shaped pixels can cause inaccuracy and
blurry images. <br/>
<br/>
The optical engine of the Octave Light R1 is custom made from the
ground up for the purpose of industrial grade stereolithography. It
contains 1920 X 1080 (more than 2 millions) square pixels to
precisely control the light pattern on the surface of the liquid
resin. Its optical components are specifically engineered to
precisely transmit ultraviolet light. Each Octave Light R1 is
calibrated with 9 digital microscopes simultaneously, to ensure its
optical and mechanical precision, before shipping out of our
factory. <br/>
<br/>
The largest pixel count digital-micro-mirror array available on the
market with an affordable price today, is a 1920 X 1080 array. With
the Octave Light R1 you are already getting the highest number of
pixel counts, in the affordable market segment. The digital micro
mirror array in the R1 is so advanced that it is only available on
the market since the Q4 of 2015. We are at the edge of technology
here. <br/>
<br/>
All other affordable DLP 3D Printers that uses UV LED light source
destroyed the accuracy of their own optics by putting mirrors and
plastic windows in the optical path of the UV light. Their design is
compromising the accuracy of their optical engine, for packaging
reasons and for cost saving reasons. <br/>
<br/>
The Octave Light R1 rejects all compromises. There are no mirrors,
no glass or plastic windows, no vat (resin tray) bottom, nothing is
blocking the optical path of our optical engine. The precision lens
of the optical engine of the R1 throw its UV light directly onto the
top surface of resin. This is another reason why our optics are of
the highest precision in the whole desktop 3D Printer market. <br/>
<br/>
As always, we go one step further. The Optical Engine of the Octave
Light R1 has an internal light intensity sensor to detect the
brightness of the LED light source. This enables the accurate
adjustment of the Ultraviolet light intensity, to ensure that the
resin layers cure depth is consistent. <br/>
<br/>
Before we go to the next point, let's inspect two printed objects
with microscope. The photo directly below is the top of the 12 mm
diameter sphere in the cathedral print. Do you see the pixels on it?
Each pixel is an exact 50 µm X 50 µm square, which is just enough
area to tightly fit in four human macrophages. <br/>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://octavelight.com/static/indiegogo2016/top-of-sphere.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>
<br/>
The Octave Light R1 is so accurate with our laser measured top-down
printing method and our industrial-stereolithography grade optics,
that you can use a microscope to look at our printed parts and see
the imprints of each of the 2 millions 50 μm X 50 μm pixels. <br/>
<br/>
The microscopic photo below is the gum between the lower two centre
front teeth of the orthodontic print. Again, you can see the square pixels.
Because our Optical Engine is sharply focused for each printed
layer, each pixel is sharply and precisely imprinted onto the
model. We do not blur things out; we are always sharply
focused. All details, even down to a pixel, are preserved with our
Top-down-with-Recoater-blade printing method. When we say the Octave
Light R1 is of the highest precision, we have the results to fully
back it up. This is not science fiction; this is the Octave Light
R1. <br/>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Top-down Printing with Recoater Blade</h2>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://octavelight.com/static/indiegogo2016/printing-loop.gif"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>
The Top-down Printing with Recoater Blade method of the Octave Light R1, is how stereolithography is done on the industrial level, since more than 20 years ago. It is proven, reliable, and widely trusted. All other popular affordable DLP / SLA 3D Printers in the market today uses the bottom-up printing method. <br/>
<br/>
Ever wonder why a bottom-up 3D Printer fails to print frequently? Printing every layer in a bottom-up 3D printer is a Tug-of-war between their build plate and their resin tray bottom. And this Tug-of-war is not two teams pulling a rope, it is their bottom-up 3D printer pulling apart the objects it is trying to print. Will the printed object breaks away from the resin tray bottom and remains attached to build plate? Or will the printed object breaks in half and falls off from the build plate? If the printed object survives the printing of this layer, will it survives the printing of the next layer and the next? Each layer is a gamble with a bottom-up 3D printer. And one print job composes of thousands of layers. This is an exponential accumulation of the risk of failure. When they are taking thousands of gamble in each of their print job, it is easy for them to loss in their gambling. <br/>
<br/>
Occasionally, when a printed object survives the act of bottom-up 3D Printing, most of the fine details on that printed object may already be gone. <br/>
<br/>
The Bottom-up way of 3D Printing also requires a larger amount of thick support rods, to hopefully hold the printed object tightly onto their build plate. The many and thick support structures required by the Bottom-up method, means long manual clean up time and rough printed objects. It also means that the Bottom-up way of 3D Printing is wasting your valuable resins to print many and thick supporting rods. <br/>
<br/>
The Octave Light R1, with our Top-down with Recoater blade method, solidifies the currently printing layer of resin between air and the previously printed portion of the object, then proceed to Recoat the next layer of liquid resin on top of the just solidified layer. There are no peeling actions and no forceful actions with the Octave Light R1. It just works. <br/>
<br/>
Our Top-down with Recoater blade method does not require many support structures. With our method the supporting rods can be thin and the connecting points can be invisibly tiny. This means we save you manual clean up time on the the printed objects and we preserve the surface of your printed objects. This also means you can effectively utilize your valuable resins to print the objects you actually want to print. <br/>
<br/>
The Top-down printing with Recoater blade process is industrially proven to be the most reliable. That's why the Octave Light R1 is the most dependable 3D Printer with an affordable price. <br/>
<br/>
All other affordable Top-down 3D printers in the market today do not have a Recoater blade. So, their printer cannot keep each printed layer flat, unless they wait forever for each layer of resin to eventually flows flat by itself. With the thickness and flatness of their layers being uncontrollable, those without-Recoater-blade Top-down 3D printers are jokes. <br/>
<br/>
The Octave Light R1 has a Recoater blade to keep each layer precisely flat and keep the print time fast. This is how it is correctly done, and we are doing it with an affordable price. <br/>
<br/>
Before we go to the next point, let's be amazed by the two photos below, from the first print featured in our Indiegogo campaign video. (Our Indiegogo campaign video will be uploaded and posted soon.) You can see a superbly spherical 12 mm diameter sphere supported by only one long 1 mm diameter thin rod. Any experienced 3D printer user would think he/she is seeing a miracle here. <br/>
<br/>
Again, this is printed by the Octave Light R1 at 25 µm per layer. We took it straight out of the R1 along with the build plate attached, rinsed it with isopropyl alcohol, and put it directly in front of a microscope for you to see. This is exactly how it was printed, by the R1. <br/>
<br/>
I hereby challenge any bottom-up 3D printers to print this. This may be an impossible miracle for any other affordable 3D printers, but this is business as usual for the Octave Light R1. <br/>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Adapts to Various Resin Levels</h2>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://octavelight.com/static/indiegogo2016/min-max.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>
Unlike the majority of top down stereolithography machines that require you to fill the resin tank full to function, the Octave Light R1 can print normally with any amount of resin you have in the tank between the min mark and the max mark. The photo above on the left is the Octave Light R1 printing at the minimum resin level, and on the right is the R1 printing at the maximum resin level. The printhead of the Octave Light R1, is always hovering right above the resin surface during a print, no matter the resin surface is at a high or a low position. This is a feature we cannot find even in high-end industrial-scale Stereolithography machines. The Octave Light R1 is full of innovative and useful functions. <br/>
<br/>
The more resin you have in the tank, the taller the objects you can print; the less resin you have in the tank, the lower is your resin level, and the shorter in height the objects you can print. This means you can save on resins with the Octave Light R1, because you only need to keep the resin level just high enough to print the objects you want to print. <br/>
<br/>
Before we go to the next point, let's see the final design of the mass production version of the Octave Light R1. The taller design is the 405nm version of the R1. The shorter-in-height design is the 365nm version of the R1. We are only displaying four design drawings of the 405nm version on this page. To view the design of the 365nm version, and to view the rest of the drawings, please check our Indiegogo campaign image gallery. <br/>
<br/>
There is a Protective Light Shield around the Octave Light R1. So, don't worry. The Shield is made with the same ultraviolet light shielding transparent plastic as our orange color resin tank. There is a sensor to detect whether the Shield is opened or closed. And the Octave Light R1 will perform an emergency stop, if the Shield is accidentally opened. The design of the Shield is beyond being functional. The R1 still looks stylish and futuristic with the Shield installed, because the Protective Light Shield is always part of the design from the beginning. <br/>
<br/>
In between prints, you can leave the remaining resin in the tank of the Octave Light R1. You can store unused resin inside the R1, just like what you would do with any industrial-scale stereolithography machines. <br/>
<br/>
The resin tank is easily removable and replaceable. We sell spare resin tanks. So you can use an extra resin tank to conveniently and quickly switch between different kind of resins.<br/>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">No Consumables, No troubles</h2>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://octavelight.com/static/indiegogo2016/emerge-from-resin.gif"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>
Rejoice, for the Octave Light R1 has no consumable parts or coatings to be replaced! 
(And it is a joy to see the finished print emerging out of resin too.) <br/>
<br/>
Gone are the days of manually scraping and reapplying the silicone PDMS coating on the B9Creator and the Form 2. Gone are the days of replacing thin and stretchy PET films. Gone are the days of spending money, time, and energy on replacing consumables. <br/>
<br/>
All other bottom-up 3D Printers in the market today has consumable parts that needed to be replaced, frequently. The B9 Creator, the Form 2, and the Ember, etc, all have a week and soft silicone PDMS coating that needed to be reapplied after printing around 1 kg of resin. It is troublesome to manually remove the old silicone coating, manually level the resin tray, and then manually apply a new layer of silicone in a dust free environment. (Or does the Formlabs company expect you to buy a brand new resin tank every time the silicone coating gets sticky or cloudy? That's a big hidden cost for their Form 2 3D Printer.) If you are printing some long and vertical rods repeatedly in the same resin tray location, you will wear out the silicone coating on their bottom-up 3D Printer so fast that it won't last more than three prints. <br/>
<br/>
Other bottom-up 3D Printers that do not have a silicone coating have stretchy and thin Teflon based PET films that gets deformed, destroyed, or punctured by their printing action and needed to be replaced often. When those 3D Printer companies describe their flexing PET film as ""permanent"", I think they actually mean ""a few months"". <br/>
<br/>
The Octave Light R1 has no consumable parts to be replaced. We save your money and, most importantly, we save you valuable time. With the Octave Light R1, you can just print, print, and print, without interruption. <br/>
<br/>
Before we go to the next point, let's enjoy three photos of the beautiful prototype #4 of the Octave Light R1. The outer ultraviolet light shield and some appearance metal panels are not installed on the prototype #4. The four integrated handles, some round corners, and a few details were not machined into the prototype #4. Otherwise, the prototype #4 is nearly mass production ready. It was already manufactured with our mass production equipments. It was made with the same kind of large scale CNC milling machines that's used for manufacturing the Macbook Pro. By the way, the Octave Light company have purchased the CNC mill in November 2015 for the sole purpose of manufacturing Octave Light 3D Printers. <br/>
<br/>
At this moment when I am writing this, we are assembling the prototype #5 and the prototype #6 simultaneously, to help us adjust our own manufacturing processes. We are already one foot stepped into mass production. <br/>
<br/>
The 365 nm Optical Engine of the prototype #7 is already completely built and fully tested. We are also machining the mechanical parts of the prototype #7 at this moment. <br/>
<br/>
I promise you the mass production version of the R1 is at least three times more stunning then the already aesthetically pleasing prototype #4. Put the Octave Light R1 in an art gallery and it fits just right in. <br/>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Industrial-grade and Easy to Use</h2>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://octavelight.com/static/indiegogo2016/mechanical-details.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>
Besides the advanced technologies already mentioned above, the Octave Light R1 contains these industrial-grade components: <br/>
<ul>
<li>Two 16 mm specification thick <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_screw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ball-bearing screws</a> to precisely and smoothly drive the Printhead Z axis and the Build platform W axis; </li>
<li>Three Nema 23 big stepper motors, to efficiently produce high torque with low electric current; and </li>
<li>Three pairs of matched, preloaded, and P5 rated, Angular Contact Bearings, to accurately support the Recoater C axis, the Printhead Z axis, and the Build platform W axis. </li>
</ul>
We use 6061 T651 aluminum and stainless steels to CNC machine the chassis of the Octave Light R1. Even the T651 heat treatment on our aluminum is aircraft grade. <br/>
<br/>
Most importantly, all of these technical achievements and industrial-grade components are integrated perfectly into the easy to use Octave Light R1. All you need to do is load your 3D Model into a computer and press the print button. We are here to put the the full power of industrial grade Stereolithography right into you hand today, in a stylish and simple-to-use desktop machine. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
If you are jewelry designer, the Octave Light R1 405nm Fine is for you. You can print out castable pattens of your beautiful jewelries right on your own desktop. Any reasonably priced castable resins designed for DLP 3D Printer is going to work. With the R1, your jewelries are going to have the finest and most beautiful details, which other bottom-up 3D Printers cannot achieve. <br/>
<br/>
The Fine versions of the R1 are perfect for investment casting of precious metals. Besides making jewelries, you can also make precision medical or dental devices with this method. <br/>
<br/>
If you are a 3D artist, then the Octave Light R1 405nm Big is for you. With the R1's comfortably big build volume, you can do limited productions of 1:6 scale figures right in your home. And if your imaginations are running wild, then larger scale figures like 1:4 can be accomplished with certain tricks. The R1 can correctly represent any textures you can digitally sculpt. The R1 preserves the surface of your model and saves your time doing post-processing, because the contact place between the support rods and the printed objects are tiny dots. It is time to turn your digital arts into real physical collectables. <br/>
<br/>
Engineers and Industrial Designers can use the Octave Light R1 to print their CAD drawings into accurate and functional prototypes. If you need to use existing industrial grade stereolithography resins to simulate the physical properties of certain types of plastics (e.g. PE, PP, ABS) or to print highly visually transparent models, then the 365nm versions is for you. If you want the cost saving of using cheap DLP 3D Printer resins, while still having the power of a true industrial-level Stereolithography machine, then the 405nm versions are for you. The Fine versions of the R1 with their 50 um X 50 um pixel pitch is perfect for printing smooth running small gears and mechanisms. If you don't print small and fast-spining gears often, then the Big version is for you. <br/>
<br/>You can even do digital manufacturing with the Octave Light R1 right in your home. <br/>
<br/>
If you are an orthodontist, then it is time to bring your previously out-sourced 3D Printing in-house, with the Big versions of the Octave Light R1. Please determine which resins you are going to use first, before selecting between the 365nm versions or the 405nm versions. The <a href=""http://www.dsm.com/content/dam/dsm/somos/en_US/documents/Brand-Status-Product-Datasheets/US%20English%20-%20A4/Somos%20BioClear%20Datasheet%20-%20US%20English%20A4.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ISO 10993-5, ISO 10993-10, and USP VI certified DSM Somos BioClear</a> is compatible with the 365nm versions of the R1. <a href=""http://dentamid.dreve.de/en/products/cad/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dreve Dentamid</a> is selling dental/orthodontic resins that are engineered to be printed with 405 nm LED DLP system. But I know that Dreve also have stereolithography resins that can be printed with the 365nm versions of the R1. <br/>
<br/>
The resin from a famously expensive German 3D Printer company, which I will not name here, are actually compatible with the 405nm versions of the R1. The price of the R1 is at least 1/5 the price of a 3D Printer from that German 3D Printer company. <br/>
<br/>
If you are a doctor, a dentist, an orthodontist, or other medical professionals, the Octave Light R1 is here to help you provide medical services quicker and at a lower cost.

</a><br/>
<br/>
<h4>2. How about software? </h4>
The computer software that is distributed with the Octave Light R1, is called Octave Light App. It is written from the ground up by my software engineer. Our software is right now in alpha stage. It will be ready in two months, when we are shipping out the Octave Light R1. <br/>
<br/>
Here is a bit of history on how our computer software came to be. The full source code of a computer software called UVDLPSlicerController, was licensed to me by the original author of UVDLPSlicerController, in May 2015. In June of 2015, I emailed the author saying that I would like to pay him to distribute his software. But the author replied saying that they ""are currently not accepting any new clients"". So, I made the decision of totally abandoning that UVDLPSlicerController computer software. And started hiring my own full-time software engineer in July 2015 to write our own computer software called the Octave Light App, from scratch. We have worked on our own independent piece of computer software for 8 months now. <br/>
<br/>
The Octave Light App is easy to use and powerful. It is going to be a free download from our website, when the R1 is shipping. So you can download the latest software upgrade from our website regularly. And every month you will get new features and improvements to the software, for free. <br/>
<br/>
The firmware of the R1 is packaged inside the Octave Light App too. So, when you are upgrading the Octave Light App, you can conveniently upgrade the firmware inside the R1 over the USB cable, by clicking a few buttons. The firmware inside the prototypes is written by me. The firmware inside the final mass production version of the R1 is written by my electrical engineer and me, using industrially proven components, including the FreeRTOS. (By the way, we design and layout the printed circuit boards of the R1, in-house.) <br/>
<br/>
Here are some of the planned features of the Octave Light App: <br/>
<ul>
<li>Functions to help you conveniently determine the optimum ultraviolet light intensity and exposure time, for any resin you put into the Octave Light R1. </li>
<li>Functions to guide you through the initial setup and preparation of the Octave Light R1. </li>
<li>Basic features like resizing, rotating, duplicating, and positioning 3D models within the build volume. </li>
<li>Basic features like importing mesh based 3D file formats, e.g. STL and OBJ. </li>
<li>Direct importing of parametric solid modeling file formats, e.g. STEP and IGES. Engineers and Industrial Designers would love this feature. Solid modeling do not have the inaccuracy of the mesh based formats. </li>
<li>Auto analyzing the 3D model and color highlighting potentially problematic areas, such as, overhang, trapped volume, etc. </li>
<li>Automatic generation of support structures. This one is critical. </li>
<li>Automatic placement of multiple 3D models on the build plate. </li>
<li>Function to hollow 3D models and the automatic generation of lattice structure inside a hollowed model. </li>
<li>Resin Drain Hole drilling function, incase your 3D model contains any trapped volumes. </li>
<li>Mesh 3D model smoothing function. </li>
<li>Antialiasing. </li>
</ul>
Let's talk about computer system requirements too. <br/>
<ul>
<li>A computer that's capable of driving a secondary display at 1920 X 1080 pixels Full HD, with HDMI cable. </li>
<li>An USB port on the computer to connect with the Octave Light R1. </li>
<li>64-bit Windows 7 SP1 or 64-bit Windows 8. </li>
</ul>
I myself have been using Mac as my primary computer for the past 13 years. So, I will push hard to have Mac OS X supported before October 2016. <br/>
<br/>
<h4>3. What resin to use? </h4>
The majority of reasonably priced resins, that are engineered for DLP 3D Printers, works with the 405nm version of the Octave Light R1. <br/>
<br/>
If your resin is sensitive to 405 nm, then the 405nm version of the Octave Light R1 is for you; if your resin is engineered for UV wavelength around 365 nm (for example, resins engineered for 355nm Solid State Lasers), then the 365 nm version of the R1 can get the job done. <br/>
<br/>
The Octave Light R1 is compatible with most stereolithography resin in the market. You can print with your own medical, dental, or orthodontic certified resins. <br/>
<br/>
The viscosity and other physical properties of the resin determine how thin the layers you can print. The resin that I used in the videos and photos of the Octave Light R1 is <a href=""https://www.makerjuice.com/shop/sf/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Maker Juice SF</a>. It is a low viscosity resin, so I can print at 25 um per layer reliably. It is reasonably priced; it is tough; and it is popular among 3D Printer enthusiasts. The only problem with Maker Juice resin is that you have to stir the tank of resin in between prints, to keep the pigments in their resin from slowly settling to the bottom. Otherwise, everything is fine with the Maker Juice SF. There are of course other reasonably priced low viscosity resins out there that do not have this pigment settling problem. <br/>
<br/>
The Octave Light R1 is compatible with transparent resins, semitransparent resins, and opaque (non-transparent) resins. <br/>
<br/>
<h4>4. What's the actions plan of delivering the Octave Light R1 by May and June of 2016? </h4>
Please <a href=""http://octavelight.com/static/indiegogo2016/actions-plan.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">click here</a> to download the pdf file of the actions plan. You can see that we ourselves have already invested all of the money into the Octave Light's engineering and manufacturing. We take the risk on our shoulders by spending our own money, time, and energy. We do this to make sure that you are not taking any risks. Place a purchase order on this pre-sales, and the Octave Light R1 is going to be delivered to you door, quickly. <br/>

Octave Light R1
the Highest Precision and the Most Dependable 3D Printer with an affordable price
Every 3D Printer enthusiast knows that top-down style
stereolithography is great. The Top-down with Recoater blade
method is what have been used in industrial-scale
stereolithography machines for more than 20 years. It is proven
and trusted. 

Yet, nobody knows how to manufacture an accurate top-down 3D
Printer with an affordable price. But things are OK now, because
the Octave Light R1 DLP Desktop 3D Printer is here to show people
how it is done. 

This is the pre-sales of the Octave Light R1, the highest
precision and the most dependable 3D Printer with an affordable
price. The objects printed by the Octave Light R1 are so accurate
that you can see the imprint of each individual DLP pixels when
inspecting the printed objects under a microscope. The 365 nm
versions of the R1 is also the first affordable 3D Printer in the
world with a 365 nm LED light source, which used to be only
available in industrial scale stereolithography machines. 

All orders will be delivered, even if our Indiegogo Flexible
Funding goal were not reached. I own the Octave Light company and I own its small factory, so I can personally promise you that your order will be
delivered, with high quality. The R1 will help you turn your
inspirations into reality. 

Since our first public announcement one month ago on 15th
February, 2016, we are already featured on two of the most
prominent 3D Printing online magazines: 







(Please click the two images above to open new windows to the articles. They are both good reads.) 

The pre-sales orders received from this Indiegogo campaign will be
shipped out of our factory starting 31st May, 2016. Why we can
deliver so fast? It is because we already have 11 full-time staffs
worked for 10 months on the Octave Light project; all major
manufacturing equipments are already installed; and the engineering
of the R1 is already in mass production stage. 

Hi, I am Charles Lo. It is my personal goal to engineer,
manufacture, and deliver the best 3D Printer to every family
on this planet. I am so committed to this mission I have already
invested my whole saving bank account into the Octave Light project.
You can help our mission by spreading the words, or by purchasing
one Octave Light R1 in this pre-sales campaign.

Why the Octave Light R1 is the highest precision and the most
dependable desktop 3D Printer with an affordable price? Please see
the reasons below. 


Laser Measured Precision

The Octave Light R1 features a Laser Measurement Sensor, that has a
resolution of 3 μm. 3 μm is less then the radius of a red blood
cell. The red dot you see on the resin in the photo above is the
laser. The rectangular and stylish box above the red dot is the
Sensor. 

This is the exact same Laser Measurement Sensor that is used in
silicon wafer manufacturing machines, in the semi-conductor industry
right now. When I say the R1 uses industrial grade components, I am
being serious. 

Why a Laser Measurement Sensor is essential for accuracy? It is
because when you put objects inside and under the resin surface, the
resin surface rises; and when you take objects out of the resin, the
resin surface lowers. 

All other affordable Top-down 3D Printers in the market today do not
know how to correctly solve their Z axis direction inaccuracy
problem, because of the rising and lowering of the resin surface. They
are out of control on how tall their printed objects actually are. 

The Octave Light R1 is the only affordable Top-down 3D Printer that
has Z axis precision! For each layer that we print, we are using the
Laser Measurement Sensor to determine the exact location of our
resin surface in real time, while we are vertically adjusting our
build platform. Therefore, the height of our printed objects are
always accurate, and all layers are always equally thin. 

All other affordable Top-down 3D Printers in the market today also
have the problem of having their projected image out of focus,
because of the varying location of the resin surface. So their
projected image is blurry. And their printed objects are deformed in
the X direction and Y direction. 

The Octave Light R1 is the only affordable Top-down 3D Printer that
can keep its projected image in shape focus. For each layer that we
print, after we have determined the exact location of our resin
surface with our Sensor, we move our Optical Engine vertically to
make sure that the focal plane always land on the resin surface.
When you inspect our printed objects, you will see our focus is so
accurate that each individual pixel of our Optical Engine is sharply
imprinted on the objects. 

Further, our Sensor is able to measure the top surface of
transparent resins. That's an astounding achievement, if you ask any
laser sensor engineer. So, the Octave Light R1 is compatible with
transparent and semi-transparent resins. 

Before we go to the next point, let's enjoy this photo of a
cathedral, two castable patterns of multi-stone rings, our logo, a
sphere, and various other interesting objects. They are all printed
simultaneously by the Octave Light R1 at 25 µm per layer. A normal
piece of letter paper is 100 µm thick. 25 µm is one quarter the
thickness of a piece of paper here. 

This 25 μm per layer performance of the Octave Light R1 is matching any industrial-scale Stereolithography machines. We are putting the precision and dependably of true industrial-level machines, right onto your desktop. Think of the implications of that! 

These printed objects are still attached to the build plate. We took the whole plate of objects
directly out of the R1, rinsed them with isopropyl alcohol, and put
them straight in front of a camera for you to see. No supporting rods
were added or removed. It was printed just this way. 


The next photo is the angel on top of the cathedral. All details are
printed perfectly. 



Ultraviolet LED runs cool

The light source of the Octave Light R1 is a powerful ultraviolet
LED, which has a long lifetime and is energy efficient. The Octave
Light R1 only turns on the ultraviolet LED right before each
exposure and immediately turns off the ultraviolet LED after each
exposure. The ultraviolet LED is off most of the time, when there is
no resin exposure to do. This further prolongs the already long
lifetime of the ultraviolet LED and the digital micro mirrors. The
Octave Light R1 is the first affordable 3D Printer to turn off its
ultraviolet LED during the time in between each exposures. 

The 365 nm LED version of the Octave Light R1 is the first
affordable 3D Printer to offer a 365 nm light source, which was
traditionally only used in industrial Stereolithography machines. 

Why our 365 nm light source is a groundbreaking feature for the whole affordable market? It is
because the majority of useful and advanced resin chemistries
only works with a true Ultraviolet light in the 365 nm range. With
our 365 nm LED, you are opened to a wide wide ranged of existing,
proven, and advanced stereolithography material selections! 

If you have any medical, dental, or orthodontic certified resins
that can only be printed with the 365 nm wavelength area (hint: 
DSM
Somos BioClear is ISO 10993-5, ISO 10993-10, and USP VI certified.), 
then the Octave Light R1 365nm is for you. The Octave Light R1 365nm 
is especially attractive to orthodontist who want to bring their 
previously out-sourced 3D Printing in-house, onto their own desktop. 

If you have any existing and traditional industrial grade
stereolithography resins (hint: all of those DSM Somos resins
engineered for 355nm Solid State Lasers), that have specific
mechanical properties or transparency properties you want, and those
existing resins are only sensitive to the 365 nm wavelength area,
then Octave Light R1 365nm can get the job done. 

Before we go to the next point, let's enjoy this Octave Light R1 print out at 1:1 scale of an orthodontic 3D scan. We are again printing at the finest setting of 25 µm layer thickness. The orthodontic model in the two photos below is still attached to the build plate. As always, we took it straight out of the R1, rinsed it with isopropyl alcohol, and put it directly in front of a camera for you to see. 

Doctors can use the Octave Light R1 to print out models of internal organs and structures from the 3D data of medical scanners. These 3D printed highly detailed and accurate physical models are particularly valuable for surgical planning. 

To push the boundary of technology further, doctors and dentists can digitally model surgical guides by referencing 3D scanned data, and then print out the surgical guides with medically certified resins. This will help the whole world perform surgeries in a even more precise and efficient way. Imagine, the day when every hospital in this world can easily effort their own high precision 3D Printer. Today is the day with the Octave Light R1. 

Orthodontists can use the Octave Light R1 to put their intraoral scanners to good use, by printing out orthodontic models directly on their own desktop, in their own office. 

Medial devices can be quickly tailor made, by trained medical professionals, with the Octave Light R1. The latest scientific discoveries and the newest technologies can be easily transformed into functional prototypes, with the Octave Light R1. 

This print out of a jaw of teeth excites not only orthodontist, dentist, and doctors. If you are a 3D artist, you can see how the Octave Light R1 correctly prints out the organic texture of the teeth and the gum. If you can digitally 3D sculpt the texture, we can print it out.




Custom Ultraviolet Optics with Direct Light Path

The Octave Light R1 is the only DLP 3D Printer in the affordable
market today, that offers both a UV LED light source and a more than
two millions pixels industrial-stereolithography-grade optical
engine. 

The majority of affordable DLP 3D Printers today (e.g., the
previous-market-leader B9 Creator) contain a consumer-grade
entertainment-level projector and use a projector light bulb as
their light source. Those projector light bulbs have short lifetime,
are energy inefficient, produce a lot of heat, and are needed to be
replaced frequently. Those cheap projectors they use were designed
and intended for movies playing and office presentation. Those
projectors were engineered to project a visual (non-ultraviolet)
colorful image a few meters away on a white wall. Those projectors
are simply inaccurate when being modified into a DLP 3D Printer,
resulting in their distorted images and their distorted prints. 

Some newer entries (for examples, Ember, MoonRay, M-Jewelry) into
the affordable DLP 3D Printers market tell you that they use an UV
LED Light Engine. What they did not tell you is that, their 405 nm
light engine contains a low end digital-micro-mirror array. Their
digital-micro-mirror array has only 912 X 1140 pixels. (That's about
1 million pixels) And those pixels are in diamond shape for cost
saving reasons. Diamond shaped pixels can cause inaccuracy and
blurry images. 

The optical engine of the Octave Light R1 is custom made from the
ground up for the purpose of industrial grade stereolithography. It
contains 1920 X 1080 (more than 2 millions) square pixels to
precisely control the light pattern on the surface of the liquid
resin. Its optical components are specifically engineered to
precisely transmit ultraviolet light. Each Octave Light R1 is
calibrated with 9 digital microscopes simultaneously, to ensure its
optical and mechanical precision, before shipping out of our
factory. 

The largest pixel count digital-micro-mirror array available on the
market with an affordable price today, is a 1920 X 1080 array. With
the Octave Light R1 you are already getting the highest number of
pixel counts, in the affordable market segment. The digital micro
mirror array in the R1 is so advanced that it is only available on
the market since the Q4 of 2015. We are at the edge of technology
here. 

All other affordable DLP 3D Printers that uses UV LED light source
destroyed the accuracy of their own optics by putting mirrors and
plastic windows in the optical path of the UV light. Their design is
compromising the accuracy of their optical engine, for packaging
reasons and for cost saving reasons. 

The Octave Light R1 rejects all compromises. There are no mirrors,
no glass or plastic windows, no vat (resin tray) bottom, nothing is
blocking the optical path of our optical engine. The precision lens
of the optical engine of the R1 throw its UV light directly onto the
top surface of resin. This is another reason why our optics are of
the highest precision in the whole desktop 3D Printer market. 

As always, we go one step further. The Optical Engine of the Octave
Light R1 has an internal light intensity sensor to detect the
brightness of the LED light source. This enables the accurate
adjustment of the Ultraviolet light intensity, to ensure that the
resin layers cure depth is consistent. 

Before we go to the next point, let's inspect two printed objects
with microscope. The photo directly below is the top of the 12 mm
diameter sphere in the cathedral print. Do you see the pixels on it?
Each pixel is an exact 50 µm X 50 µm square, which is just enough
area to tightly fit in four human macrophages. 


The Octave Light R1 is so accurate with our laser measured top-down
printing method and our industrial-stereolithography grade optics,
that you can use a microscope to look at our printed parts and see
the imprints of each of the 2 millions 50 μm X 50 μm pixels. 

The microscopic photo below is the gum between the lower two centre
front teeth of the orthodontic print. Again, you can see the square pixels.
Because our Optical Engine is sharply focused for each printed
layer, each pixel is sharply and precisely imprinted onto the
model. We do not blur things out; we are always sharply
focused. All details, even down to a pixel, are preserved with our
Top-down-with-Recoater-blade printing method. When we say the Octave
Light R1 is of the highest precision, we have the results to fully
back it up. This is not science fiction; this is the Octave Light
R1. 

 
Top-down Printing with Recoater Blade

The Top-down Printing with Recoater Blade method of the Octave Light R1, is how stereolithography is done on the industrial level, since more than 20 years ago. It is proven, reliable, and widely trusted. All other popular affordable DLP / SLA 3D Printers in the market today uses the bottom-up printing method. 

Ever wonder why a bottom-up 3D Printer fails to print frequently? Printing every layer in a bottom-up 3D printer is a Tug-of-war between their build plate and their resin tray bottom. And this Tug-of-war is not two teams pulling a rope, it is their bottom-up 3D printer pulling apart the objects it is trying to print. Will the printed object breaks away from the resin tray bottom and remains attached to build plate? Or will the printed object breaks in half and falls off from the build plate? If the printed object survives the printing of this layer, will it survives the printing of the next layer and the next? Each layer is a gamble with a bottom-up 3D printer. And one print job composes of thousands of layers. This is an exponential accumulation of the risk of failure. When they are taking thousands of gamble in each of their print job, it is easy for them to loss in their gambling. 

Occasionally, when a printed object survives the act of bottom-up 3D Printing, most of the fine details on that printed object may already be gone. 

The Bottom-up way of 3D Printing also requires a larger amount of thick support rods, to hopefully hold the printed object tightly onto their build plate. The many and thick support structures required by the Bottom-up method, means long manual clean up time and rough printed objects. It also means that the Bottom-up way of 3D Printing is wasting your valuable resins to print many and thick supporting rods. 

The Octave Light R1, with our Top-down with Recoater blade method, solidifies the currently printing layer of resin between air and the previously printed portion of the object, then proceed to Recoat the next layer of liquid resin on top of the just solidified layer. There are no peeling actions and no forceful actions with the Octave Light R1. It just works. 

Our Top-down with Recoater blade method does not require many support structures. With our method the supporting rods can be thin and the connecting points can be invisibly tiny. This means we save you manual clean up time on the the printed objects and we preserve the surface of your printed objects. This also means you can effectively utilize your valuable resins to print the objects you actually want to print. 

The Top-down printing with Recoater blade process is industrially proven to be the most reliable. That's why the Octave Light R1 is the most dependable 3D Printer with an affordable price. 

All other affordable Top-down 3D printers in the market today do not have a Recoater blade. So, their printer cannot keep each printed layer flat, unless they wait forever for each layer of resin to eventually flows flat by itself. With the thickness and flatness of their layers being uncontrollable, those without-Recoater-blade Top-down 3D printers are jokes. 

The Octave Light R1 has a Recoater blade to keep each layer precisely flat and keep the print time fast. This is how it is correctly done, and we are doing it with an affordable price. 

Before we go to the next point, let's be amazed by the two photos below, from the first print featured in our Indiegogo campaign video. (Our Indiegogo campaign video will be uploaded and posted soon.) You can see a superbly spherical 12 mm diameter sphere supported by only one long 1 mm diameter thin rod. Any experienced 3D printer user would think he/she is seeing a miracle here. 

Again, this is printed by the Octave Light R1 at 25 µm per layer. We took it straight out of the R1 along with the build plate attached, rinsed it with isopropyl alcohol, and put it directly in front of a microscope for you to see. This is exactly how it was printed, by the R1. 

I hereby challenge any bottom-up 3D printers to print this. This may be an impossible miracle for any other affordable 3D printers, but this is business as usual for the Octave Light R1. 




Adapts to Various Resin Levels

Unlike the majority of top down stereolithography machines that require you to fill the resin tank full to function, the Octave Light R1 can print normally with any amount of resin you have in the tank between the min mark and the max mark. The photo above on the left is the Octave Light R1 printing at the minimum resin level, and on the right is the R1 printing at the maximum resin level. The printhead of the Octave Light R1, is always hovering right above the resin surface during a print, no matter the resin surface is at a high or a low position. This is a feature we cannot find even in high-end industrial-scale Stereolithography machines. The Octave Light R1 is full of innovative and useful functions. 

The more resin you have in the tank, the taller the objects you can print; the less resin you have in the tank, the lower is your resin level, and the shorter in height the objects you can print. This means you can save on resins with the Octave Light R1, because you only need to keep the resin level just high enough to print the objects you want to print. 

Before we go to the next point, let's see the final design of the mass production version of the Octave Light R1. The taller design is the 405nm version of the R1. The shorter-in-height design is the 365nm version of the R1. We are only displaying four design drawings of the 405nm version on this page. To view the design of the 365nm version, and to view the rest of the drawings, please check our Indiegogo campaign image gallery. 

There is a Protective Light Shield around the Octave Light R1. So, don't worry. The Shield is made with the same ultraviolet light shielding transparent plastic as our orange color resin tank. There is a sensor to detect whether the Shield is opened or closed. And the Octave Light R1 will perform an emergency stop, if the Shield is accidentally opened. The design of the Shield is beyond being functional. The R1 still looks stylish and futuristic with the Shield installed, because the Protective Light Shield is always part of the design from the beginning. 

In between prints, you can leave the remaining resin in the tank of the Octave Light R1. You can store unused resin inside the R1, just like what you would do with any industrial-scale stereolithography machines. 

The resin tank is easily removable and replaceable. We sell spare resin tanks. So you can use an extra resin tank to conveniently and quickly switch between different kind of resins.







No Consumables, No troubles

Rejoice, for the Octave Light R1 has no consumable parts or coatings to be replaced! 
(And it is a joy to see the finished print emerging out of resin too.) 

Gone are the days of manually scraping and reapplying the silicone PDMS coating on the B9Creator and the Form 2. Gone are the days of replacing thin and stretchy PET films. Gone are the days of spending money, time, and energy on replacing consumables. 

All other bottom-up 3D Printers in the market today has consumable parts that needed to be replaced, frequently. The B9 Creator, the Form 2, and the Ember, etc, all have a week and soft silicone PDMS coating that needed to be reapplied after printing around 1 kg of resin. It is troublesome to manually remove the old silicone coating, manually level the resin tray, and then manually apply a new layer of silicone in a dust free environment. (Or does the Formlabs company expect you to buy a brand new resin tank every time the silicone coating gets sticky or cloudy? That's a big hidden cost for their Form 2 3D Printer.) If you are printing some long and vertical rods repeatedly in the same resin tray location, you will wear out the silicone coating on their bottom-up 3D Printer so fast that it won't last more than three prints. 

Other bottom-up 3D Printers that do not have a silicone coating have stretchy and thin Teflon based PET films that gets deformed, destroyed, or punctured by their printing action and needed to be replaced often. When those 3D Printer companies describe their flexing PET film as ""permanent"", I think they actually mean ""a few months"". 

The Octave Light R1 has no consumable parts to be replaced. We save your money and, most importantly, we save you valuable time. With the Octave Light R1, you can just print, print, and print, without interruption. 

Before we go to the next point, let's enjoy three photos of the beautiful prototype #4 of the Octave Light R1. The outer ultraviolet light shield and some appearance metal panels are not installed on the prototype #4. The four integrated handles, some round corners, and a few details were not machined into the prototype #4. Otherwise, the prototype #4 is nearly mass production ready. It was already manufactured with our mass production equipments. It was made with the same kind of large scale CNC milling machines that's used for manufacturing the Macbook Pro. By the way, the Octave Light company have purchased the CNC mill in November 2015 for the sole purpose of manufacturing Octave Light 3D Printers. 

At this moment when I am writing this, we are assembling the prototype #5 and the prototype #6 simultaneously, to help us adjust our own manufacturing processes. We are already one foot stepped into mass production. 

The 365 nm Optical Engine of the prototype #7 is already completely built and fully tested. We are also machining the mechanical parts of the prototype #7 at this moment. 

I promise you the mass production version of the R1 is at least three times more stunning then the already aesthetically pleasing prototype #4. Put the Octave Light R1 in an art gallery and it fits just right in. 





Industrial-grade and Easy to Use

Besides the advanced technologies already mentioned above, the Octave Light R1 contains these industrial-grade components: 

Two 16 mm specification thick ball-bearing screws to precisely and smoothly drive the Printhead Z axis and the Build platform W axis; 
Three Nema 23 big stepper motors, to efficiently produce high torque with low electric current; and 
Three pairs of matched, preloaded, and P5 rated, Angular Contact Bearings, to accurately support the Recoater C axis, the Printhead Z axis, and the Build platform W axis. 

We use 6061 T651 aluminum and stainless steels to CNC machine the chassis of the Octave Light R1. Even the T651 heat treatment on our aluminum is aircraft grade. 

Most importantly, all of these technical achievements and industrial-grade components are integrated perfectly into the easy to use Octave Light R1. All you need to do is load your 3D Model into a computer and press the print button. We are here to put the the full power of industrial grade Stereolithography right into you hand today, in a stylish and simple-to-use desktop machine. 

Right before we go to the final point, let me introduce you to some of our core team members. In the photo below, from left to right, is

If you are jewelry designer, the Octave Light R1 405nm Fine is for you. You can print out castable pattens of your beautiful jewelries right on your own desktop. Any reasonably priced castable resins designed for DLP 3D Printer is going to work. With the R1, your jewelries are going to have the finest and most beautiful details, which other bottom-up 3D Printers cannot achieve. 

The Fine versions of the R1 are perfect for investment casting of precious metals. Besides making jewelries, you can also make precision medical or dental devices with this method. 

If you are a 3D artist, then the Octave Light R1 405nm Big is for you. With the R1's comfortably big build volume, you can do limited productions of 1:6 scale figures right in your home. And if your imaginations are running wild, then larger scale figures like 1:4 can be accomplished with certain tricks. The R1 can correctly represent any textures you can digitally sculpt. The R1 preserves the surface of your model and saves your time doing post-processing, because the contact place between the support rods and the printed objects are tiny dots. It is time to turn your digital arts into real physical collectables. 

Engineers and Industrial Designers can use the Octave Light R1 to print their CAD drawings into accurate and functional prototypes. If you need to use existing industrial grade stereolithography resins to simulate the physical properties of certain types of plastics (e.g. PE, PP, ABS) or to print highly visually transparent models, then the 365nm versions is for you. If you want the cost saving of using cheap DLP 3D Printer resins, while still having the power of a true industrial-level Stereolithography machine, then the 405nm versions are for you. The Fine versions of the R1 with their 50 um X 50 um pixel pitch is perfect for printing smooth running small gears and mechanisms. If you don't print small and fast-spining gears often, then the Big version is for you. 
You can even do digital manufacturing with the Octave Light R1 right in your home. 

If you are an orthodontist, then it is time to bring your previously out-sourced 3D Printing in-house, with the Big versions of the Octave Light R1. Please determine which resins you are going to use first, before selecting between the 365nm versions or the 405nm versions. The ISO 10993-5, ISO 10993-10, and USP VI certified DSM Somos BioClear is compatible with the 365nm versions of the R1. Dreve Dentamid is selling dental/orthodontic resins that are engineered to be printed with 405 nm LED DLP system. But I know that Dreve also have stereolithography resins that can be printed with the 365nm versions of the R1. 

The resin from a famously expensive German 3D Printer company, which I will not name here, are actually compatible with the 405nm versions of the R1. The price of the R1 is at least 1/5 the price of a 3D Printer from that German 3D Printer company. 

If you are a doctor, a dentist, an orthodontist, or other medical professionals, the Octave Light R1 is here to help you provide medical services quicker and at a lower cost. Obviously, I am an industrialist; I am not a doctor, not a dentist, not an orthodontist, and not any other medical professionals. So, please do your own researches and make your decision yourself. You are welcome to contact me by emailing to 
charles@octavelight.com to discuss more on the potential usages of the Octave Light R1. 

No matter who you are, the Octave Light R1 helps you easily turn your inspirations into reality. 



Before we go to the Q&A section, please click here to download the pdf file of the bonus gifts, when the pre-sales orders exceeds certain volumes. 
These are attractive gifts. So, here are even more reasons to share the news on the Octave Light R1. 




And here is the first video we every publicly posted, on 15th Feb, 2016. It is a bit long, and our video shooting skills certainly improved a lot within one month. 



Questions and Answers Section: 
1. How does the Octave Light R1 3D printer compare to others? 
Please click here to download the pdf file of comparison. I promise an entertaining read. 




2. How about software? 
The computer software that is distributed with the Octave Light R1, is called Octave Light App. It is written from the ground up by my software engineer. Our software is right now in alpha stage. It will be ready in two months, when we are shipping out the Octave Light R1. 

Here is a bit of history on how our computer software came to be. The full source code of a computer software called UVDLPSlicerController, was licensed to me by the original author of UVDLPSlicerController, in May 2015. In June of 2015, I emailed the author saying that I would like to pay him to distribute his software. But the author replied saying that they ""are currently not accepting any new clients"". So, I made the decision of totally abandoning that UVDLPSlicerController computer software. And started hiring my own full-time software engineer in July 2015 to write our own computer software called the Octave Light App, from scratch. We have worked on our own independent piece of computer software for 8 months now. 

The Octave Light App is easy to use and powerful. It is going to be a free download from our website, when the R1 is shipping. So you can download the latest software upgrade from our website regularly. And every month you will get new features and improvements to the software, for free. 

The firmware of the R1 is packaged inside the Octave Light App too. So, when you are upgrading the Octave Light App, you can conveniently upgrade the firmware inside the R1 over the USB cable, by clicking a few buttons. The firmware inside the prototypes is written by me. The firmware inside the final mass production version of the R1 is written by my electrical engineer and me, using industrially proven components, including the FreeRTOS. (By the way, we design and layout the printed circuit boards of the R1, in-house.) 

Here are some of the planned features of the Octave Light App: 

Functions to help you conveniently determine the optimum ultraviolet light intensity and exposure time, for any resin you put into the Octave Light R1. 
Functions to guide you through the initial setup and preparation of the Octave Light R1. 
Basic features like resizing, rotating, duplicating, and positioning 3D models within the build volume. 
Basic features like importing mesh based 3D file formats, e.g. STL and OBJ. 
Direct importing of parametric solid modeling file formats, e.g. STEP and IGES. Engineers and Industrial Designers would love this feature. Solid modeling do not have the inaccuracy of the mesh based formats. 
Auto analyzing the 3D model and color highlighting potentially problematic areas, such as, overhang, trapped volume, etc. 
Automatic generation of support structures. This one is critical. 
Automatic placement of multiple 3D models on the build plate. 
Function to hollow 3D models and the automatic generation of lattice structure inside a hollowed model. 
Resin Drain Hole drilling function, incase your 3D model contains any trapped volumes. 
Mesh 3D model smoothing function. 
Antialiasing. 

Let's talk about computer system requirements too. 

A computer that's capable of driving a secondary display at 1920 X 1080 pixels Full HD, with HDMI cable. 
An USB port on the computer to connect with the Octave Light R1. 
64-bit Windows 7 SP1 or 64-bit Windows 8. 

I myself have been using Mac as my primary computer for the past 13 years. So, I will push hard to have Mac OS X supported before October 2016. 

3. What resin to use? 
The majority of reasonably priced resins, that are engineered for DLP 3D Printers, works with the 405nm version of the Octave Light R1. 

If your resin is sensitive to 405 nm, then the 405nm version of the Octave Light R1 is for you; if your resin is engineered for UV wavelength around 365 nm (for example, resins engineered for 355nm Solid State Lasers), then the 365 nm version of the R1 can get the job done. 

The Octave Light R1 is compatible with most stereolithography resin in the market. You can print with your own medical, dental, or orthodontic certified resins. 

The viscosity and other physical properties of the resin determine how thin the layers you can print. The resin that I used in the videos and photos of the Octave Light R1 is Maker Juice SF. It is a low viscosity resin, so I can print at 25 um per layer reliably. It is reasonably priced; it is tough; and it is popular among 3D Printer enthusiasts. The only problem with Maker Juice resin is that you have to stir the tank of resin in between prints, to keep the pigments in their resin from slowly settling to the bottom. Otherwise, everything is fine with the Maker Juice SF. There are of course other reasonably priced low viscosity resins out there that do not have this pigment settling problem. 

The Octave Light R1 is compatible with transparent resins, semitransparent resins, and opaque (non-transparent) resins. 

4. What's the actions plan of delivering the Octave Light R1 by May and June of 2016? 
Please click here to download the pdf file of the actions plan. You can see that we ourselves have already invested all of the money into the Octave Light's engineering and manufacturing. We take the risk on our shoulders by spending our own money, time, and energy. We do this to make sure that you are not taking any risks. Place a purchase order on this pre-sales, and the Octave Light R1 is going to be delivered to you door, quickly. 




5. Why use Indiegogo? 
Indiegogo is utilized for its popularity and global reach. We are selling one of the best desktop 3D Printer in the world with an extremely affordable price, so we need a large quantity of orders to be economical. 

6. Where is Octave Light Ltd.? 
Our Hong Kong address is 
Unit 1, 3/F., Block A, New Trade Plaza, 6 On Ping Street, Shatin, N.T., Hong Kong
Our Hong Kong location manages accounting and logistics. 

Our mainland China address is 
No.8 Qiaoxin Road, Qiaotou Dongguan, Guangdong, P.R. China
Postal Code: 523525
Our mainland China location is where our R&D, engineering, and manufacturing is done. 

Your Octave Light R1 is going to be shipped out of our Hong Kong warehouse, to every location on this planet that FedEx can reach. 

The Octave Light R1 is big in size, because we reject all compromises in our engineering. The shipping cost we charge is reasonable for a package of the size of the R1. 

If you do not see your country in the shipping cost calculation of this Indiegogo pre-sales, please drop me an email (
charles@octavelight.com) and I will get it fixed. 

7. Why name your company Octave Light? 
People know about the octave musical scale of sound. Only a few people know that lightwave, which is also called electromagnetic wave, has the octave scale too. Our company is named after the natural phenomenon of the octave wave scale in light. 

According to modern science, there are no differences between music and noise. Both are sound. However, music is actually different from noise or ordinary sound. What makes music eternal? What ordinary sound lacks? 

I would like our products to have that musical eternal quality, which is a most subtle thing to be noticed. 

8. When will you put up something on your OctaveLight.com website? 
You are looking at a one man publicity team here. We have 11 full-time staffs, but all of them are focused on engineering and manufacturing the Octave Light R1. All of our resources are focused sharply onto engineering and manufacturing the R1. 

I am going to put up something good onto our website once I have time available. I do not do something, unless I do it with quality and heart.",33.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p>This is a knife so this is something every parent will have to decide
for themselves. I (Chef Randall) as a parent allow my 3 kids to use it. My son
is 12 years old and can use it extremely well, and we always supervise our
daughters (age 8-10). I don’t let them cut hard vegetables, but as many parent
knows kids like to participate in cooking so as an example my 8 year old helped
me cut up parsley. I took off the leaves for her and then I showed her how to
do it without having her hand on the cutting board so there was no way she
could cut herself – I would not of course let her cut a carrot, which needs to
be held when cutting.</p>

Here's the BedShelfie in a nutshell:(1) Made for the Millennial Minimalist. The BedShelfie clears up floor space while still giving you the ease of a nightstand. It’s also more fun to transport :)(2) Smart Design. The BedShelfie attaches to nearly any bed frame, without tools, using a clamping system that comfortably holds up to 15 pounds of your most important bedside items within arm’s reach.(3) Eco-Friendly. The BedShelfie is handcrafted out of bamboo which grows exponentially faster than wood.           The BedShelfie is perfect for:

Minimalists freeing themselves of clunky furniture ( ... looking at you Tiny House Peeps)

Urbanites mastering the fine art of Small Space City Living 

College Students squeezed into sardine-like dorm rooms

Parents who want to give their kids the best bunk bed experience ever
       The BedShelfie features:
A clean and minimal design profile for versatility 
A wire slot for easy device charging 

Rounded edges for safety 

A versatile clamp design that accommodates bedframe edges up to 2.25 inches wide 
A sturdy hold - it can hold up to 15 pounds


Thick felt padding on clamp touch points to prevent scratching


2 Colors: Natural Bamboo + Black Oil Stained Bamboo 
Surface Area: ~12.75 x 8.5 inches (think 13 inch Macbook) 
Weight: ~3.5lbs
     Rewind two years.Rent was skyrocketing in LA causing apartment square footage to shrink+I was beginning to realize “less is more” (after reading 'The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up')=I sought to free myself from bedroom clutter. Some combination of traveling for work (as a Disney Imagineer) + moving apartments every few years allowed me to finally give up on clunky furniture. From working in the complex world of Theme Parks, I knew the best design always fulfilled multiple goals. To replace the nightstand, the solution had to be equal parts beautiful, sturdy, easy to use and eco-friendly.    My first ‘aha’ moment came when studying the incredible strength and versatility of the time-tested clamp mechanism.The design question, at hand, became finding a way to translate the strength of something that was traditionally metal, into something both beautiful and eco-friendly.       Building a sustainable future is absolutely paramount to us. We're proud to handcraft the BedShelfie out of Bamboo. Even though Bamboo is technically considered a grass, it's harder than Oak and matures in just 3-5 years (vs 100 years for Oak). So it's an incredible renewable resource.         After months of prototyping, samples and real world testing (several of which are on my own bed right now), we're proud to partner with a production facility that shares the same values of craftsmanship, ethics and environmental standards. As you can see in the images below, we're nearing the completion on our first 500 BedShelfies for the first 500 backers. We're excited to announce the BedShelfie is ready for the world!",20.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>I am astonished how quickly we reached our goal! Thank you so much to everyone who contributed!! But don't stop now, we still have many days of fundraising left to go.  The original $550 will go directly to buying ten mattresses for the children currently going without, but that doesn't mean more funds couldn't be utilized. Any extra money raised will go towards purchasing  new bed frames which will be placed in the new residential building, when construction is over. We had already started planning a Haitian art auction to raise the additional $4500 needed  to replace the mattresses for all the children and buy new bed frames, but if some of that could be raised on this site that would be great! Once again, thank you everyone for your donations, your support means everything to the orphanage, as well as, to myself. </p>
<p><strong>************************************************************************************************</strong></p>
<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>In early 2011 I was given the opportunity to work with the Rutgers School of Social Work to raise money for the charity of my choice. In my research I came across LaConcorde Orphanage. Located in Carrefour, Haiti, the institution was severely affected by the 2010 earthquake. The facilities were completely destroyed, leaving 50 orphans with just a few tents to live under in a lot of only 700 sq feet. Along with Architecture for Humanity and through Love Takes Root, I have been raising money for the construction of a new school for the Orphanage. While this campaign has been extremely successful, there are still several basic needs for the children that are not being met. On a recent visit, I discovered that 10 of the children were sleeping on wire bed frames with no mattresses. This is absolutely unacceptable, as all children at least deserve a bed to sleep on. I have launched this campaign in order to alleviate the situation as quickly as possible, hoping to raise enough funds so that the director of the orphanage may purchase mattresses for the children. </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>The funds raised from this campaign will be sent to the director of the orphanage, Frantz Bastien. Frantz will then use the funds to purchase mattresses for the 10 children sleeping without them. We would prefer to purchase the mattresses in Haiti, as Frantz will have better discretion in deciding which mattresses will fit the bed frames, in addition to the expense and time commitment involved in sending materials to Haiti. If we do not reach our entire goal, we will use the funds collected to buy as many mattresses as possible and some of the children will remain on the wire frames until funds can be secured.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>It is important that we do not overlook the simple necessities when dealing with disaster zones. For these children to grow into successful adults, it is important that they have their basic needs met while they are young. By having mattresses to sleep on, the children will be more able to focus in school and become educated and strong young adults; which is exactly what Haiti needs for a sustainable future.</p>

<p><strong>Other Ways We Have Helped</strong></p>
<p>In the past, infectious disease transferring from child to child was a big issue in the small lot that the orphanage is currently located. In order to prevent this from occurring, Love Takes Root held a fundraiser and collected enough funds to provide each child with their own personalized blanket, reducing the amount of germs that are spread. Since that initiative began, the occurrence of ring worm and other disease in the children has been cut in half.</p></div>","*******************************************Update***********************************************
I am astonished how quickly we reached our goal! Thank you so much to everyone who contributed!! But don't stop now, we still have many days of fundraising left to go.  The original $550 will go directly to buying ten mattresses for the children currently going without, but that doesn't mean more funds couldn't be utilized. Any extra money raised will go towards purchasing  new bed frames which will be placed in the new residential building, when construction is over. We had already started planning a Haitian art auction to raise the additional $4500 needed  to replace the mattresses for all the children and buy new bed frames, but if some of that could be raised on this site that would be great! Once again, thank you everyone for your donations, your support means everything to the orphanage, as well as, to myself.

Short Summary
In early 2011 I was given the opportunity to work with the Rutgers School of Social Work to raise money for the charity of my choice. In my research I came across LaConcorde Orphanage. Located in Carrefour, Haiti, the institution was severely affected by the 2010 earthquake. The facilities were completely destroyed, leaving 50 orphans with just a few tents to live under in a lot of only 700 sq feet. Along with Architecture for Humanity and through Love Takes Root, I have been raising money for the construction of a new school for the Orphanage. While this campaign has been extremely successful, there are still several basic needs for the children that are not being met. On a recent visit, I discovered that 10 of the children were sleeping on wire bed frames with no mattresses. This is absolutely unacceptable, as all children at least deserve a bed to sleep on. I have launched this campaign in order to alleviate the situation as quickly as possible, hoping to raise enough funds so that the director of the orphanage may purchase mattresses for the children. 
What We Need & What You Get
The funds raised from this campaign will be sent to the director of the orphanage, Frantz Bastien. Frantz will then use the funds to purchase mattresses for the 10 children sleeping without them. We would prefer to purchase the mattresses in Haiti, as Frantz will have better discretion in deciding which mattresses will fit the bed frames, in addition to the expense and time commitment involved in sending materials to Haiti. If we do not reach our entire goal, we will use the funds collected to buy as many mattresses as possible and some of the children will remain on the wire frames until funds can be secured.
The Impact
It is important that we do not overlook the simple necessities when dealing with disaster zones. For these children to grow into successful adults, it is important that they have their basic needs met while they are young. By having mattresses to sleep on, the children will be more able to focus in school and become educated and strong young adults; which is exactly what Haiti needs for a sustainable future.
