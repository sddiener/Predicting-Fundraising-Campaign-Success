guitar thing already”. That was, until the apple fell out of the
double neck tree, and hit me on the head.</p><p>

<p></p><h3>What is it?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>	My Double Neck is actually two guitars that connect together in
seconds (patent pending), and is the coolest thing your guitar
friends, and your audience will ever see! Play the main guitar –
play the mini – then hook 'em together and blow everyone's mind! 
</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<h3>What makes Flux special?</h3>
<p>Great guitars have to be more than cool looking, they have to play
like butter and sound amazing – these do! 12 strings are my thing, it's what I play with my <i>own</i> band. They're like the perfect effects pedal - your super-lush secret weapon!
</p>
<p>The Flux Double Neck isn't just some novelty (although it is fun to see a whole audience go ""WTF!"" at once!), it's a first class, hand-built, tour-ready machine!<br/></p>
<p>If you order a guitar during this Indiegogo campaign, you'll get our low-as-we-dare introductory prices. Also, you'll notice a select few perks have a delivery date of December 25th. And with Christmas coming up, a Flux guitar would completely freak out that guitar-nut in your life! <br/></p>
<p>Orders placed after this campaign or that exceed my perk limits will sell for the same price, with a 6 to 8 month delivery time (from date of order). And <b>we love lefties</b> - no extra charge for left-handed models!<br/></p>
<p></p>~A word about guitar pricing:
<br/>The other day, as I waited for my son to get out of his piano lessons at
a local music store, I sat there playing a new $129 big-name guitar.
<i>$129?!</i>  Increasingly, guitar companies move their production overseas, to
countries with questionable human rights and unfair wages, resulting
in very low prices (and sometimes, quality). At Flux, I do every operation by
hand, using as many locally-sourced materials as possible; my prices
reflect that. Just something to keep in mind.<p></p>

Only three available at this price! Look for our new perk!

Whoa! Sean Lennon checking out the Magnetic Double Neck!
Who builds these things?
	I do. My name is Scott Gorsuch, and I've been building guitars
and tube amps for almost 40 years. My musician friends have always
told me I ought to get into the custom guitar market, and I've always
shook my head and replied, “no, too many guys doing the boutique
guitar thing already”. That was, until the apple fell out of the
double neck tree, and hit me on the head.
	Now I've got something unique to offer: the Flux
magnetic double neck.

This certification should take three to five weeks (3 to 5) depending on the country. Following this will we select a manufacturer and move forward with production.If everything goes according to plan, the first batch of Lexes Connectors should be received by the end of February 2017. Our early bird delivery date is set for March 2017; this gives us a margin of approximately four (4) weeks. Delay and design changes could result from the certification process and the four week margin allows for this.Finally, logistics and communication issues could arise, especially in case of a high number of backers. We have established agreements with a company experienced in Kickstarter campaigns; they will support our efforts throughout this adventure.Our main goal is making our backers happy and sending their rewards on time; we will do our best to stay on track, reward our backers and fulfill their expectations. No matter what obstacles lie ahead we promise to be 100% transparent in our communication with you. We want the best - and we know you do too.",24.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Hello everyone,</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Let me
present you the story of a kit-car assembled entirely according to my own
design.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The
first idea of assembling my own car came into my mind on 9<sup>th</sup>
December 2005. From the beginning it was supposed to be a kit-car with a closed
body and weight not exceeding 550 kg (due to Polish regulations in force at the
time allowing such cars to be driven from the age of 16) based on Fiat Seicento
car parts.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Low mass,
series-produced mechanical components and architecture typical for a race car were
to result in an extremely effective, but at the same time rather inexpensive
sports car. It would be the first modern sports car competing with the world
class sport cars without any inferiority complex. Nobody expected that in a few
years a prototype equipped with an engine with the lowest power possible (55
km) would beat Subaru Impreza GT on the race track…</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><i>“Adding power makes you faster
on the straights. Subtracting weight makes you faster everywhere.”</i></blockquote>
<p>                                                       – Colin Chapman, F1 driver, founder of Lotus Cars</p>
<p>In the prototype I used a 1100
ccm engine, but ultimately I plan to use a 1400 ccm T-Jet engine with an increased
power of 200–230 hp ;-).</p>
<p></p>
<p>The
concept is based on a few basic premises:</p>
<ol>

is much more uncompromising and more prepared for the real sport competition,
while still adjusted to everyday use on the road. It will be fitted with a roll cage that is a standard component
of the car’s structure, so the chassis doesn’t have to be modified in order to
allow safe track racing. A smaller engine and a simplified structure result in
a reduced length and mass of the car, which has a positive effect on its performance
and steering.</span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Ultimately, it will be possible
to order Kozmo as a finished product constructed in line with a previously determined
specification or as a kit-car to be assembled by the customer. Within the
framework of series production several dozens of cars are planned to be
manufactured in the first year. A more long-term forecast is harder to provide
due to the unique nature of the project.</p><p><br/></p>
<h3>STAGE
1.</h3><h4>Everything started with sketches on an A4 sheet of paper.</h4>
<p>I have
always dreamed of a small, two-man sports car with a rear engine – inexpensive,
with a simple structure and as effective as possible in high-speed driving,
while at the same time always ready to be used at a race track or a special stage of a rally.</p>

<h3>STAGE 5.</h3><h4>Body model.</h4>
<p></p>
<p>After successful tests of the
framework, I started working on the body model.</p>
<p>The model has to mirror the
shape of a real car body. It will be the basis for future moulds (negatives) to
be used for production of the actual body components. Such models are often
created from clay or Styrofoam with a plaster finish. I chose Styrofoam,
because in our case the model was to be mounted on the actual prototype
framework. Due to the fact that at the time when we begun works 3D CNC machines
were very expensive, the project planned to use digitally cut 5 cm thick Styrofoam
boards of increased density glued together.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After precisely matching and gluing
together the cut and meticulously numbered puzzle pieces, the edges and uneven
spots were to be smoothed out, plastered and polished. At each stage, the
symmetry of both sides of the body has to be carefully watched. Keeping it
requires measuring the body, marking it in the measuring grid and carefully comparing
every point using a profile gauge.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After achieving the body shape in
line with the design, the model has to be cut into body components (i.e. doors
and flaps have to be separated etc.) and carefully finished, including
technical profiles. When each part has the final shape it should be primed by spray
so that the surface is prepared for creating a mould.</p>

</div><div><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></div><div></div></div>","A car made of passion and
dreams, created to bring the world of racing closer. An inexpensive race car authorised
to be used in road traffic.

Hello everyone,

Let me
present you the story of a kit-car assembled entirely according to my own
design.

The
first idea of assembling my own car came into my mind on 9th
December 2005. From the beginning it was supposed to be a kit-car with a closed
body and weight not exceeding 550 kg (due to Polish regulations in force at the
time allowing such cars to be driven from the age of 16) based on Fiat Seicento
car parts.

Low mass,
series-produced mechanical components and architecture typical for a race car were
to result in an extremely effective, but at the same time rather inexpensive
sports car. It would be the first modern sports car competing with the world
class sport cars without any inferiority complex. Nobody expected that in a few
years a prototype equipped with an engine with the lowest power possible (55
km) would beat Subaru Impreza GT on the race track…

“Adding power makes you faster
on the straights. Subtracting weight makes you faster everywhere.”
                                                       – Colin Chapman, F1 driver, founder of Lotus Cars
In the prototype I used a 1100
ccm engine, but ultimately I plan to use a 1400 ccm T-Jet engine with an increased
power of 200–230 hp ;-).

The
concept is based on a few basic premises:

Architecture typical for race cars (space frame),
Inexpensive and easily accessible mechanical components
     from popular models of Fiat / Alfa Romeo,
Equipment allowing the car to be authorised to be
     used in road traffic.


Currently,

Compared to its competitors, Kozmo
is much more uncompromising and more prepared for the real sport competition,
while still adjusted to everyday use on the road. It will be fitted with a roll cage that is a standard component
of the car’s structure, so the chassis doesn’t have to be modified in order to
allow safe track racing. A smaller engine and a simplified structure result in
a reduced length and mass of the car, which has a positive effect on its performance
and steering.

Ultimately, it will be possible
to order Kozmo as a finished product constructed in line with a previously determined
specification or as a kit-car to be assembled by the customer. Within the
framework of series production several dozens of cars are planned to be
manufactured in the first year. A more long-term forecast is harder to provide
due to the unique nature of the project.
STAGE
1.Everything started with sketches on an A4 sheet of paper.
I have
always dreamed of a small, two-man sports car with a rear engine – inexpensive,
with a simple structure and as effective as possible in high-speed driving,
while at the same time always ready to be used at a race track or a special stage of a rally.


STAGE 2.Designing a digital
version of the framework and the body.

STAGE 3. Constructing the space
frame.

Finally, the long-awaited day
came when the engine was started for the first time.


STAGE 4.Then the car was
tested on the Rakietowa race track.
On 28th December
2008, the first drive with a prototype chassis took place.

In April, we took
several test drives on a race track in Wroclaw. The main test driver was my
youngest brother, who is a rally driver and who was able to adjust the
suspension and test the prototype to its fullest potential.


STAGE 5.Body model.

After successful tests of the
framework, I started working on the body model.
The model has to mirror the
shape of a real car body. It will be the basis for future moulds (negatives) to
be used for production of the actual body components. Such models are often
created from clay or Styrofoam with a plaster finish. I chose Styrofoam,
because in our case the model was to be mounted on the actual prototype
framework. Due to the fact that at the time when we begun works 3D CNC machines
were very expensive, the project planned to use digitally cut 5 cm thick Styrofoam
boards of increased density glued together.

After precisely matching and gluing
together the cut and meticulously numbered puzzle pieces, the edges and uneven
spots were to be smoothed out, plastered and polished. At each stage, the
symmetry of both sides of the body has to be carefully watched. Keeping it
requires measuring the body, marking it in the measuring grid and carefully comparing
every point using a profile gauge.

After achieving the body shape in
line with the design, the model has to be cut into body components (i.e. doors
and flaps have to be separated etc.) and carefully finished, including
technical profiles. When each part has the final shape it should be primed by spray
so that the surface is prepared for creating a mould.

Windows frames
use elements from Fiat Seicento and Alfa Romeo GTV.
In mid-2008 the project was
transferred from Wrocław to Warsaw.

The basic tool used for
symmetrical modelling the body – a profile gauge.

Before/after polishing.

Having modelled the body in
line with the design, I cut it into separate parts.

Doors only required a great
deal of work:

This is how the car looked at
the final stage of polishing, before being primed.

Here you can see KOZMO wrapped
in foil:

STAGE 6.Priming.
Currently, the body model is primed
and prepared for creating the mould that will be used for series production of
the final body components.


In the meantime,
first glass fibre body parts were created. These include interior elements of
doors manufactured by carbonbike.pl company that specialises in production of
the world’s lightest handbikes and various types of car body parts made of
carbon fibre. Below you can see the photos of the moulds and the first
prototype body component:
Currently, I have reached this
stage. The prototype looks like this:

And
that is how Kozmo is going to look after completion. These renders take into
account all the stylistic changes I introduced in the course of works on the
actual body model.
In
order to finish the prototype I need your support!

managed to read up to this point ;-)

</p>
<p>With your tablet
attached to mangroovv you gain a complete computer work station. You now have the
option to work comfortably, efficiently and in an ergonomic position at any
location. You simply use your tablet where you choose to ... without even
thinking of a table or board to put it on.</p>
<p>mangroovv makes
an ultra-mobile office or an ultra-mobile leisure park.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>The first floor stand that
is fun to carry around.</b></p>
<p>Every
single feature helps you to enjoy using mangroovv intuitively:</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>1. One grip and mangroovv is ready for transport.</b></p>

<p>If you can pass
an obstacle or a narrow doorway by yourself, you can pass it with mangroovv. It will be at your hand, without leaving scratches on your
furniture or any precious accessories, without bumping into door frames or
getting stuck in lifts. And you do not have to worry about your legs – no
bumping, no trouble, no damages.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p><b>One hand only</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Nearly all of
mangroovv’s functions can be accomplished by only one hand:</p>
<p>To fold and
unfold the feet, lower the working height, adjust the angle, fasten or unfasten
the tablet ... You will appreciate the numerous advantages very soon,
especially when you need to hold something in your other hand.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Advantages: more
comfortable, more efficient and more healthy</b></p>
<p>Now you can have
even more fun with your tablet, while working, gaming or doing whatever you
love to do with it:</p>
<p>Use
it at any location with both hands, <b>or</b>
have both hands free!</p>
<p>- 
Both hands
are free for activities while you get all your information on your tablet (cooking,
crafting, playing an instrument ...)</p>
<p>- 
Change
whatever you are doing spontaneously without having to think for one moment where
to put your tablet down (get fresh coffee, wash your hands ...)</p>
<p>- 
Minimize the
stress on your hands, sinews and muscles as you do not have to hold your tablet
in an unnatural position all the time.</p>
<p>- 
You can be
sure to have your tablet in safety, even in ‚unfavourable’ surroundings like
garages, kitchens, building sites.</p>

<br/>
<p><b>Historical facts</b></p>
<p>The idea of mangroovv
was born even before tablets started their trail of success 2010. In 2007, the ‚pre-tablet’
era, we created a floor stand to hold and present printed information. One year
later we had the vision of a lightweight screen with an integrated computer
allowing for numerous applications instead of a plain board presenting paper.
The only thing was that there was no such computer at that time.</p>
<p>When finally the
first iPad entered the market we realized that this was exactly the computer
that we had dreamt of. What we did not like was the idea to combine a flexible
and mobile tool like an iPad with rather a cumbersome floor stand.</p>
<p>Then the basic concept
for an ultra mobile floor stand emerged at the beginning of 2012. We saw a
vision of a stand that folds automatically when you snatch it, and that can be
put down easily again wherever you choose. A stand that holds a tablet safely,
but also offers the option to use it again on its own without much fuss.</p>
<p>It took us more
than one year to develop all the mechanics that led to mangroovv as you can see
here now: showing features that surely make it the world’s most ergonomic floor
stand.</p>
<p>By the way,
mangroovv marks a completely new era in our company as well: It  stands for the first product since we
realigned our ideas concerning the future of our company. In 2012 we decided to
create only those products that we would love to have and use ourselves. This
being the only way to infuse our products time and time again with passion, joy and the
strong commitment for continual improvement.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Timetable</b></p>
<p>As mangroovv is
not our first product to be launched we are adept at planning ahead, however we
are aware that unexpected things may and will happen.</p>
<p>Our estimated
timetable:</p>
<p>- 
May 2015:
ready to go into production. Basically mangroovv is nearly ready for mass
production, but still some features need to be cleared with producers, some of
these aspects depending on the number of first orders. We will know the numbers
more exactly after the crowdfunding will be finished. The more orders, the more
potential ...</p>
<p>- 
until November
2015: production (including quality and load tests, manufacturing of tools ...)</p>
<p>- 
December

floor stand mangroovv is as mobile as your tablet... and ready for use
instantly.



With your tablet
attached to mangroovv you gain a complete computer work station. You now have the
option to work comfortably, efficiently and in an ergonomic position at any
location. You simply use your tablet where you choose to ... without even
thinking of a table or board to put it on.
mangroovv makes
an ultra-mobile office or an ultra-mobile leisure park.

The first floor stand that
is fun to carry around.
Every
single feature helps you to enjoy using mangroovv intuitively:


1. One grip and mangroovv is ready for transport.





When you grasp
mangroovv with one of your hands, its feet fold automatically and it gets very
slim. Now you can cross any room or doorway.
If you can pass
an obstacle or a narrow doorway by yourself, you can pass it with mangroovv. It will be at your hand, without leaving scratches on your
furniture or any precious accessories, without bumping into door frames or
getting stuck in lifts. And you do not have to worry about your legs – no
bumping, no trouble, no damages.



2. One move and mangroovv is ready for use.



You put mangroovv
down and off you go. Just one move of your hand and the feet unfold exactly
where you choose to be. Mangroovv stands securely, be it on carpet, parquet,
tiles, gravel, grass ... even in a puddle if necessary.
Good
to know: its legs fold and unfold at any height!



3. You lift it and it feels
light.



Mangroovv is
ultra-light, weighing only 800 grams (1,8 pound).



These features
offer the option to have mangroovv at hand and even change rooms easily. Now,
the following features were created to use your tablet in a healthy and comfortable
position at any location:

4. One move and the working height is right.




Only one move of
your hand is necessary to adjust mangroovv to the height that is needed for you
to work either in a sitting or standing position – the working height ranging
from about 75 to 110 cm (30 to 43 inches).



5. One move and your working position is perfect




With another
simple move of your hand you adjust your tablet to the desired  working position. No annoying locking and
unlocking of the ball joint as you know it from a camera tripod. Due to our
cageless ball-joint you rotate, tilt or turn your tablet around, at any chosen
angle, and your tablet stays exactly in that position when you take off your
hand.

The following
feature makes us proud: do you want to use your tablet on its own again?
6. You grab your tablet and it is solo
again

Only one move and
you unfasten your tablet ... to use it on its own again – just as you are used
to. To fasten it again works just as fast.



One hand only

Nearly all of
mangroovv’s functions can be accomplished by only one hand:
To fold and
unfold the feet, lower the working height, adjust the angle, fasten or unfasten
the tablet ... You will appreciate the numerous advantages very soon,
especially when you need to hold something in your other hand.

Advantages: more
comfortable, more efficient and more healthy
Now you can have
even more fun with your tablet, while working, gaming or doing whatever you
love to do with it:
Use
it at any location with both hands, or
have both hands free!
- 
Both hands
are free for activities while you get all your information on your tablet (cooking,
crafting, playing an instrument ...)
- 
Change
whatever you are doing spontaneously without having to think for one moment where
to put your tablet down (get fresh coffee, wash your hands ...)
- 
Minimize the
stress on your hands, sinews and muscles as you do not have to hold your tablet
in an unnatural position all the time.
- 
You can be
sure to have your tablet in safety, even in ‚unfavourable’ surroundings like
garages, kitchens, building sites.

Design






Our intention was to give mangroovv rather a plain design with all its precious features hidden inside.
Concerning the attachment of your tablet, we created a pure look with nearly invisible clips. These tailored clips will be delivered for all full-size iPads from iPad 2 up to current iPad versions at the time of delivery. So, if there will be a bigger version (iPad pro?) you can be sure to use mangroovv with it.
We will also deliver a pair of universal clips fitting any common 10-13 inch tablet.
All types of clips will be easily interchangeable.


mangroovv comes in two
versions

As you see in our
video, mangroovv is available in silver. You can opt for black as well (e.g.
for musicians on stage).

And who are we?
We always have been committed to developing new product categories, like our magnet sail as
the first transparent magnetic pin board. Or our desk sail: it radically
renewed those ever so conservative looking table banners.
Our references
include numerous internationally wellknown companies, by way of example Audi,
VW, Siemens, Bayer, Ergo, Airbus ...
We have received
several internationally respected design awards:
- 
red dot:
best of the best 2002
- 
iF product
design award 2008
- 
iF product
design award 2011
- 
several
nominations for Germany’s Design Award

Historical facts
The idea of mangroovv
was born even before tablets started their trail of success 2010. In 2007, the ‚pre-tablet’
era, we created a floor stand to hold and present printed information. One year
later we had the vision of a lightweight screen with an integrated computer
allowing for numerous applications instead of a plain board presenting paper.
The only thing was that there was no such computer at that time.
When finally the
first iPad entered the market we realized that this was exactly the computer
that we had dreamt of. What we did not like was the idea to combine a flexible
and mobile tool like an iPad with rather a cumbersome floor stand.
Then the basic concept
for an ultra mobile floor stand emerged at the beginning of 2012. We saw a
vision of a stand that folds automatically when you snatch it, and that can be
put down easily again wherever you choose. A stand that holds a tablet safely,
but also offers the option to use it again on its own without much fuss.
It took us more
than one year to develop all the mechanics that led to mangroovv as you can see
here now: showing features that surely make it the world’s most ergonomic floor
stand.
By the way,
mangroovv marks a completely new era in our company as well: It  stands for the first product since we
realigned our ideas concerning the future of our company. In 2012 we decided to
create only those products that we would love to have and use ourselves. This
being the only way to infuse our products time and time again with passion, joy and the
strong commitment for continual improvement.

Timetable
As mangroovv is
not our first product to be launched we are adept at planning ahead, however we
are aware that unexpected things may and will happen.
Our estimated
timetable:
- 
May 2015:
ready to go into production. Basically mangroovv is nearly ready for mass
production, but still some features need to be cleared with producers, some of
these aspects depending on the number of first orders. We will know the numbers
more exactly after the crowdfunding will be finished. The more orders, the more
potential ...
- 
until November
2015: production (including quality and load tests, manufacturing of tools ...)
- 
December
2015: estimated delivery

<p><b>What is KaVii made of?</b></p>
<p>KaVii is made from AB Glue. AB glue is the nickname of two mixed hardening liquid
glues. One is a base labeled as ""B,"" and the other is additive or hardener labeled ""A.""  Mixing A with B will result in hardening, which does not have to rely on
temperature to cure, so it is a kind of room temperature curing adhesive. </p>
<p>AB glue is usually referred to as acrylic modified
epoxy adhesive or epoxy adhesive. Component A is acrylic modified epoxy, component B is modified amine
or other hardening agents. They
will be mixed according to a certain proportion. Catalysts can control the curing
time; other additives control properties (such as viscosity, rigidity, flexibility,
adhesiveness, etc).<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> </span></p>

<br/><p></p>
<p>The composition to make KaVii is so complicated since we can not freeze or heat the basic material.  Therefore, we need to make sure a balance of the flexibility and adhesivity is perfect for each pad. </p>
<p>Also, the material is recyclable :)</p>

What we learned from our previous campaign is: it's not easy to find an adhesive pad that is really sticky and has stable consistency for each pad when mass produced. That is why we are working so hard to make sure the composition of the mixing material is perfect.  We have been really selective in picking the best manufacture for our Ver.2 this time, and we have a stricter quality control policy. <div>

</div></div>","Find out what you get if you share our campaign ↓↓↓KaVii Adhesive (Ver.2)
Earlier this year we brought you the best adhesive gel pads in the market, and people are loving it!  We shipped more than 10,000 PCs of KaVii from January 2015 to September 2015.  Now we want to move to another crowdfunding platform to share our Version 2 of KaVii Adhesive. It's bigger, better and stickier!



KaVii Adhesive is a durable adhesive gel pad that affixes mobile 
technology to nearly any flat surface. It functions very much 
like double-sided tape, but KaVii has a thicker core, and unique texture. It's an alternative way for you to stick your electronic gadgets, trinkets, office supplies, and more at an affordable price.
KaVii is rewashable and reusable!

Take off, Wash, Air dry, Reuse!If KaVii loses it stickiness because of dust and dirt, you can easily wash it with water and let it air dry. KaVii will regain its stickiness significantly in no time. 
For our Ver.2, we made KaVii bigger and better for adhering larger objects to a variety of flat surfaces.  Now you can stick remote controls, small picture frames, medium size external batteries, and of course big smartphones and tablets to nearly any flat surface.Comparison with Smartphone



When using KaVii, we always recommend to TWIST OFF rigid objects when removing.  Please do not pull with force from the surface. Instead of nails that leave permanent holes in your walls, or tape that can potentially damage posters and are also difficult to remove from your walls, KaVii can be a great replacement for sticking up your favorite photos and posters. 


Poster Size 55"" x 35""
If you're nervous about using those foamy double-sided tapes that usually come packaged with car ornaments (such as air fresheners, or bobble head trinkets), you can use KaVii to securely attach any car accessories to your dash board without worrying about leaving a mark on any surface.  You can re-size your KaVii pad for smaller items by cutting it into smaller pieces. 





KaVii can hold in an environment between 0°F to 150°F and will not melt inside your heated car!

What is KaVii made of?
KaVii is made from AB Glue. AB glue is the nickname of two mixed hardening liquid
glues. One is a base labeled as ""B,"" and the other is additive or hardener labeled ""A.""  Mixing A with B will result in hardening, which does not have to rely on
temperature to cure, so it is a kind of room temperature curing adhesive. 
AB glue is usually referred to as acrylic modified
epoxy adhesive or epoxy adhesive. Component A is acrylic modified epoxy, component B is modified amine
or other hardening agents. They
will be mixed according to a certain proportion. Catalysts can control the curing
time; other additives control properties (such as viscosity, rigidity, flexibility,
adhesiveness, etc). 



The composition to make KaVii is so complicated since we can not freeze or heat the basic material.  Therefore, we need to make sure a balance of the flexibility and adhesivity is perfect for each pad. 
Also, the material is recyclable :)
KaVii Adhesive material passed the SGS Protection test.




KaVii can be used for so many things:

Sticking your tablet on the wall while you watch your favorite shows



Sticking your smartphone to any flat surface to take group pictures so nobody feels left out :)






Have video conference calls with friends and loved one, Hands free!






Make your own Time lapse video with your smartphone.










Make extra room on your working table by sticking all your important accessories on the wall, like USB cards, charging cables, external batteries and more.






Best dashboard car mount in the world, will not melt under high sun heat. Easy to apply and easy to remove.
A new tool to put up posters on the wall without needing to worry about making any holes.
More, more and more! Share ideas on how you use your KaVii with us on Instagram by following us @KaVii_adhesive



Through personal testing with the Ver.2, we made sure the size and thickness of each KaVii pad is perfect for securing bigger objects.  Most sticky pads out there are so thin with just 0.03"", we made KaVii thicker with 0.12"" thickness. 

Original KaVii Size 1.89"" x 1.89"" x 0.08"" - KaVii Ver.2 Size is 2.96"" x 2.56"" x 0.12""

<br/>Since our crowdfunding efforts failed, we decided to form a relationship with several private investors/lenders who are providing us with the capital we need to get things done. Obviously, we missed our planned launch date of 2/17/2016 due to many unforeseen issues including both hardware and software related. But now, that phase is behind us and we're finally shipping devices. Nuclius Orders from all sources will resume in June following a major DRM/Security firmware update that needs to be installed by the manufacturer. This is a critical update that is designed to protect both ours and other's Live TV and exclusive content. IGG Backers will get theirs first followed by everyone else. And several IGG Backers will receive their devices prior to that time so you can begin spreading the word and your experience with Nuclius.</div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494642967/zprzw7dhb7bt8cftnrna.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div>
<p>We've also completely removed ourselves from our former MLM roots and have converted to a new hybrid Referral-based business model fully positioned to allow all Consumers to capitalize on the Tsunami of customers that will flood into Triniti as a result of people hearing about Nuclius for the very first time. Like Nuclius, this system is a first of its kind and will change the way products/services are introduced to Consumers. The timing couldn't be better because people are ready to make the mad dash from Cable &amp; Satellite as fast as they can. We're paying $100 for <b>each</b> Subscriber Household that Locks-In their Nuclius Order as we prepare for launch. Yes you read that right. $100 Cash for each Nuclius Offer Lock-In and it's paid Lightning Fast... every week.

We do apologize for the long period of silence, and now I am extremely excited to announce that we've finally emerged from the BatCave ready to accomplish what we've set out to accomplish so long ago. The Live TV Hostile Takeover is officially about to begin!As many of you obviously know, our efforts to get Nuclius into the mainstream by way of crowdfunding were thwarted due to the stonewalling efforts of our Cable/Satellite competition, the media companies they own and now even the banks they deal with. But they all doubted our resolve!

All is for free!<br/><br/></p><h4>Q: Keeping my WiFi active will consume more battery than keeping the 3G active?</h4><p>Wi-Fi is more efficient and uses less battery in modern phones than the 3G radio while associated with an access point. - More info: <a href=""http://people.cs.umass.edu/~arun/papers/TailEnder.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://people.cs.umass.edu/~arun/papers/TailEnder.pdf</a></p><p><a href=""http://people.cs.umass.edu/~arun/papers/TailEnder.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><br/></p><h4>Q: Will my smartphone be able to receive this information?</h4><p>The information is transmitted to your phone using the regular WiFi connection. It means that, if your smartphone has WiFi, it's “able” to benefit from this service.<br/><br/></p><h4>Q: Does this mean I can access Internet for free in the tram?</h4><p>No. WIPIN gives you read-only access of the vehicle information. You can only receive what the tram decides to tell your phone.<br/><br/></p><h4>Q: Is this secure?</h4><p>All information is cryptographically signed and cannot be faked.<br/><br/></p><h4>Q: How far is this service available from the autobus/tram/train?</h4><p>WIPIN transmission range works just like any other WiFi device, with ranges up to 200 meters. However, we plan to limit the transmitters to ~2m range to make sure you won't be confused with info from more than one vehicle.<br/><br/></p><h4>Q: Why do you want to make it free?</h4><p>Like everyone we like free and useful stuff, WIPIN is going to be a platform made by US for US. We believe that only free services have a chance of spreading worldwide! This isn't a business for us, it's an opportunity, with your help, to create something really cool and useful for everybody, and the most important thing, free!<br/><br/></p><h4>Q: Can I interact in the WIPIN app with other users in the autobus?</h4><p>No, the point of WIPIN is to give you information (context) about the bus, not to communicate.<br/><br/></p><h4>Q: Is WIPIN app trying to replace the others public transport applications?</h4><p>We are not trying to replace those apps. We want to give you real time information about the physical bus you are standing next to. Depending on the situation and your need, you can use any public transport app that is more suitable for you.<br/><br/></p><h4>Q: But my phone is able to find my location with GPS in 3 seconds! Why are you talking about location?!</h4><p>99% of the time your phone is using WiFi scanning to triangulate your location based on data from Google or others. If you have no Internet connection (e.g. abroad) you will quickly find out how ""slow"" and inaccurate your GPS really is.</p><p><br/></p></div>","Brochure -> English, EspañolHave you ever found yourself in any of the following situations?

No, the Wipin device is in the autobus/Tram/train and you don't need to do anything with it, when you're using the Wipin app, this is requesting the information to the Wipin device automatically, basically, all what you'll ""see"" is only the Wipin app.FAQQ: How much will the app cost?Nothing! It's for free!Q: Will this service consume a lot data transfer from my internet plan in my phone?No, You don't need to have Internet data transfer in your phone at all. No internet connection is required.Q: How much do I need to pay to get the information in my smartphone?Nothing! All is for free!Q: Keeping my WiFi active will consume more battery than keeping the 3G active?Wi-Fi is more efficient and uses less battery in modern phones than the 3G radio while associated with an access point. - More info: http://people.cs.umass.edu/~arun/papers/TailEnder.pdfQ: Will my smartphone be able to receive this information?The information is transmitted to your phone using the regular WiFi connection. It means that, if your smartphone has WiFi, it's “able” to benefit from this service.Q: Does this mean I can access Internet for free in the tram?No. WIPIN gives you read-only access of the vehicle information. You can only receive what the tram decides to tell your phone.Q: Is this secure?All information is cryptographically signed and cannot be faked.Q: How far is this service available from the autobus/tram/train?WIPIN transmission range works just like any other WiFi device, with ranges up to 200 meters. However, we plan to limit the transmitters to ~2m range to make sure you won't be confused with info from more than one vehicle.Q: Why do you want to make it free?Like everyone we like free and useful stuff, WIPIN is going to be a platform made by US for US. We believe that only free services have a chance of spreading worldwide! This isn't a business for us, it's an opportunity, with your help, to create something really cool and useful for everybody, and the most important thing, free!Q: Can I interact in the WIPIN app with other users in the autobus?No, the point of WIPIN is to give you information (context) about the bus, not to communicate.Q: Is WIPIN app trying to replace the others public transport applications?We are not trying to replace those apps. We want to give you real time information about the physical bus you are standing next to. Depending on the situation and your need, you can use any public transport app that is more suitable for you.Q: But my phone is able to find my location with GPS in 3 seconds! Why are you talking about location?!99% of the time your phone is using WiFi scanning to triangulate your location based on data from Google or others. If you have no Internet connection (e.g. abroad) you will quickly find out how ""slow"" and inaccurate your GPS really is.",14.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>The OMS acts as an ""always on"" display. Staff simply view customer app orders and ring them into your current till as normal.

<p>We have spent almost 2 years working alongside staff to find the best solution thats easily integrated into their existing daily habits. They love that they don't have to learn how to use complex and intimidating new software and that the screen real estate of their till isn't made smaller to allow room for the app OMS. All staff have found it a familiar process akin to serving a customer at the counter, and because the order tablet is attached just above the till screen, alerting them as orders arrive, they never miss a trick. </p>

</div></div>","At BeansUp, we make beautiful, intuitive technology that enhances your brand ethos and your businesses bottom line. Everything we do is underpinned by a passion for coffee.  ""This Indiegogo Campaign Gives Any Coffee Shop a Branded Order + Pay App Just Like Starbucks....With None Of The Huge Expense""We take all the time, expense and technical knowledge required out of creating a beautiful, fully branded mobile order & payment app for your coffee shop. We give you an app, and the simple, intuitive software to integrate it into your business today.The large corporate brands like Starbucks are making mobile payment apps, and the new levels of customer convenience they offer, ubiquitous throughout the coffee industry....increasing their customer loyalty and spend as they do it. Why can't coffee shops just like yours offer customers this same innovative technology?? The huge cost and time of developing your own solution makes it an unaffordable and high risk proposition. This is where BeansUp comes in. We bring you this innovative coffee-focused app technology for an affordable subscription. Your app is completely customised with your branding and available in the iOS and Android app stores. Customers simply search your brand name and hit download. It's that easy. Your app enables your customers to order & pay from their phones, earning loyalty points as they spend. Whether thats an office worker pre-ordering and paying for a sandwich and a coffee to collect, or a customer at a table working on their laptop ordering a second coffee without having to leave their seat and precious cargo unattended! Engage your customers by sending tailored offers directly to their phones. Easily edit your loyalty reward, menu or almost anything using our intuitive web-based business dashboard. Check out our features list and videos belowWe launched nearly a year ago and have built a customer base from Chicago to Dublin, with our apps being used to process thousands of orders, increase consumer loyalty and spend while promoting the rich origins of coffee. Our wealth of experience means you can have confidence that we can deliver...we already have, to customers just like you. Back us today, to receive the latest version of our customised order & payment app, the intuitive management software used to run it and updates that are free, forever. Your help on Indiegogo will be invaluable in enabling us to add exciting new features into what is already an award winning product. Take advantage of these exclusive Indiegogo discounts. Future-proof your business, today. Why have we spent two years developing, improving and testing this amazing product for coffee shops? We have immersed ourselves in the world of coffee from perfecting our Aeropress techniques at home, to exhibiting at the SCAE World of Coffee events in Rimini and Gothenburg. One thing is clear, how customers are interacting with coffee shops is changing rapidly. The coffee industry is in the midst of a seismic shift towards consumer focused technology. This focus is revolutionising how customers interact with coffee shops just like yours. The entire industry has awoken to the huge opportunity of mobile and payment technology. These innovations are app based, and industry shaping. This technology isn't being utilised merely for technologies sake, it is consistently boosting sales, loyalty, customer satisfaction and in-store efficiencies.  This shift towards mobile app innovation is becoming a staple of the branded chains, boosting their performance and winning them new customers, but the opportunity hasn't yet filtered to the independents and smaller chains. Why?!  While we have been hard at work creating an amazing product for the independently owned coffee shops, the corporate giants like Starbucks have proven the global markets embrace of this new app technology. Their latest app update, like our product, enables customers to pre-order and pay to collect, and has been a resounding success with over 20% of total orders being placed by customers through their app, millions of transactions a week, and to quoteHoward Schultz (Starbucks CEO) ""In those stores where mobile order and pay app has been deployed...lines are shorter....service is faster.....we are more efficient""This order & pay app technology is fast becoming ubiquitous across the coffee industry and with the clear benefits it presents, this would be a brilliant opportunity for all coffee shops.....if there was a level playing field. A bespoke app solution involves a budget in the tens of thousands, upfront risk, a development team and months of work. This is a huge problem, not for the large corporate chains with exponential resources, but for the vibrant independent coffee shops like yours, who have worked tirelessly to source their coffee, create their menu, and earned the loyalty of their customers. Why should you not be able to take full advantage of this technology to offer your customers the quality products and service you have perfected, with all the convenience offered by a customised app solution. In a modern age where faster simply isn't fast enough, your customers convenience is everything, and convenience is an app based solution for your cafe. We believe technology should work to enhance your customer experience and compliment your brand ethos, and our platform does. Over the coming years the term customer experience will be all encompassing of both your face to face AND digital to consumer interactions. Both should be personal, and personalised, with our bespoke apps they will be. We've built our platform from the ground up with and for coffee shop owners just like you. We've listened to what you care about and brought these ideas to life. Like having a way to tell your bean to cup coffee story to customers. Check out our app feature list below to find out more about our""Origin and Traceability"" feature. 


At BeansUp we give you so much more than an app. We give you an ecosystem with all the necessary tools including an intuitive, easy to use CMS (content management system). This means that although we provide everything setup, and ready to earn you money out of the box, you have all the control if you wish to tweak any aspect of your content. The power is in your hands!



How Do My Staff Receive The App Orders?
We've created an amazingly simple and intuitive Order Management Software (OMS) for your staff. The best part? 100% Compatibility with your current Point of Sale. 
We've built our OMS with staff in mind from the ground up. The Order Management System runs on a tablet that attaches to your current POS. This means we are compatible with any till system and highly adaptable to any of your needs.
The OMS tablet is provided as part of our Essentials Package Reward but the software is web based and can run on any wi-fi enabled device you own like a laptop. If you already own tablets or want to source your own thats no problem. The OMS device we supply (Google Nexus Retina Tablet) simply attaches to your current POS. 
The OMS acts as an ""always on"" display. Staff simply view customer app orders and ring them into your current till as normal. All app orders are already paid for so we recommend staff input the order into the till, keeping their end of day receipts and totals balanced. Most of our customers simply programme an ""App"" button to sit alongside ""cash"" and ""card"" on their POS. 
We have spent almost 2 years working alongside staff to find the best solution thats easily integrated into their existing daily habits. They love that they don't have to learn how to use complex and intimidating new software and that the screen real estate of their till isn't made smaller to allow room for the app OMS. All staff have found it a familiar process akin to serving a customer at the counter, and because the order tablet is attached just above the till screen, alerting them as orders arrive, they never miss a trick. 
View the order and ring it into the POS. It's that simple. 


Order & Pay
Your customers can order + pay from your menu. Whether that's office workers pre-ordering and pre-paying their lunch to collect, or someone looking to order a 2nd coffee from their table.


Pre-Order To Collect
Customers can pre-order & pre-pay to collect. It's as easy as pre-order, walk-in store, collect + go! Customers ♡ the convenience, and staff ♡ that they know exactly when customers are arriving. Less pressure = happier staff!

Your customers earn loyalty through your app as they spend. Unlike the very limited, traditional stamped loyalty cards you can reward your customers in exciting and engaging new ways. Double reward points on the quieter weekdays? No problem!



Tailored Offers
No more marketing guesswork. Engage your customers with personalised offers. The best thing....our software does the hard work for you! Want to reward only your top 5% of most loyal customers with a free coffee? BeansUp has you covered.



Promote Your Coffee Origins & Traceability
Educate your customers in a personalised way on the origins and traceability of your coffee. You simply enter the origin, roast and body type. You can even add brew methods. We take this information and display it in a beautiful way to the customer. Of course, you can choose to ignore this feature and simply upload your coffees with name and price. The control is in your hands.


Bank Level Security
All customer payments made to you by customers are secured with 256 bit encryption, that's bank level security. This is why we use Stripe as our payment processor. One-touch payments, an intuitive payments interface and data security.....also they have the cheapest payment processing rate available.

We had purchased various VPN (virtual private network) services which claimed to be able to access blocked sites. Not to mention most charged an expensive recurring fees, ranging from $6 to more than $30 per month,  it's also a <strong>great hassle to download the vpn software</strong> in each computer, and the <strong>need to switch from servers to servers</strong> as she keeps blocking VPN servers.

I was in Malaysia and was not able to access some China websites and some sites were very slow loading. After I plugged in the USB into the computer, all the sites can be accessed within just a few seconds. </p><p>A side advantage is that our team has developed an encryption technology, which prevents tracking the ip address of the computer we are using, <strong>to maintain our online data privacy and security.</strong></p><p>This  has turned into a major security for virtually everybody as we are now all at risks of being <strong>spied over by authorities or even hackers</strong>

everything you have done online, who may report to government authorities on
your activities. <strong>Hackers can use your IP address to </strong>trace
your personal information such as street address and phone number.  </p><p> However, our encryption technology enables our <strong>VPN USB to act as an
IP shield</strong> so no matter where you go online, your real IP address cannot be
traced. They can only get the IP address of our server.<span>  Hackers are therefore prevented from stealing

So this sparks the idea of <strong>making this device commercially available for everyone</strong>. To make this possible, we need to subscribe for more dedicated servers, and upgrade encryption technology for more widespread use. Currently, this USB can only be used for Win7 operating system. We will need <strong>to develop new USB for Win8, and also for Mac</strong> in the near future, if there is sufficient demand. </p><p>So we appeal to your contribution to enable us to complete this project to <strong>help make the Web safer and more secure</strong>, not just for our benefits, but also to <strong>protect the data privacy and security of all our families and young children</strong> as we can't live without going online in this era of the Great Internet.</p><p>Wait, we need a brand name for this USB.

As most of us know, the Great Wall has blocked popular sites such as Google, Facebook, Twitter and Youtube. We had purchased various VPN (virtual private network) services which claimed to be able to access blocked sites. Not to mention most charged an expensive recurring fees, ranging from $6 to more than $30 per month,  it's also a great hassle to download the vpn software in each computer, and the need to switch from servers to servers as she keeps blocking VPN servers. Recently,  we experienced even more difficulty in accessing VPN services in China with a widespread blockage of VPN servers. See a report at the International Business Times.To solve this problem, we have hired a team to develop the first ""Plug and Browse"" USB flash drive in-built with VPN services. It's just the size of a thumb and is easy to carry.There is no software to download. Just carry this small USB and plug to any laptop or computer usb port. Then I will be prompted to enter a password and click confirm.Voila!  I can successfully access Google, Facebook, and Twitter in just less than 3 seconds! This can even unblock Youtube and the videos can be played smoothly. So a computer dummy like me can use this magic device with super ease.This magic VPN USB also works anywhere to access blocked sites. I was in Malaysia and was not able to access some China websites and some sites were very slow loading. After I plugged in the USB into the computer, all the sites can be accessed within just a few seconds. A side advantage is that our team has developed an encryption technology, which prevents tracking the ip address of the computer we are using, to maintain our online data privacy and security.This  has turned into a major security for virtually everybody as we are now all at risks of being spied over by authorities or even hackers
when we are using computers or going online. They can see the web sites we are
visiting and the things we are writing, even what we are doing is perfectly legal.
Your ISP knows
everything you have done online, who may report to government authorities on
your activities. Hackers can use your IP address to trace
your personal information such as street address and phone number.   However, our encryption technology enables our VPN USB to act as an
IP shield so no matter where you go online, your real IP address cannot be
traced. They can only get the IP address of our server.  Hackers are therefore prevented from stealing
your personal information or launching attacks against your IP address.I am now going online and writing in Kuala Lumpur, and my ip address can be tracked online  as shown below.
Now I plug our USB into my laptop, and my real ip address is masked and changed to another ip in Hong Kong immediately as shown below.Accordingly, we are able to surf the Web anonymously with privacy, security and peace of mind. Currently, this USB is only for the use of our own team. However, we have received a lot of requests from our customers and friends who are interested to get one or more for their use and their company's. So this sparks the idea of making this device commercially available for everyone. To make this possible, we need to subscribe for more dedicated servers, and upgrade encryption technology for more widespread use. Currently, this USB can only be used for Win7 operating system. We will need to develop new USB for Win8, and also for Mac in the near future, if there is sufficient demand. So we appeal to your contribution to enable us to complete this project to help make the Web safer and more secure, not just for our benefits, but also to protect the data privacy and security of all our families and young children as we can't live without going online in this era of the Great Internet.Wait, we need a brand name for this USB. What about ""Faceoff VPN"" USB? Surfing the Web without showing our face, unless we want to! Sounds good?UPDATE as at March 3, 2015One backer asked me whether this device can access banned sites in schools and offices. While I have not personally tried this out, I have consulted my tech team and they replied in the affirmative, as sites are banned only with the server they are using to access the banned sites. However, this USB will change the original server to our server automatically, and our server can access any sites.FAQs",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>See all those people that are bogged down in airport lounges, crowded around the outlets charging their phones? Do you want to elbow your way around them? Do you want to fight for an outlet just to have to sit down to recharge? </p>
<p><b>FORGET IT!</b> Its bad enough that you are going to have to sit in a tight airplane seat next to a total stranger.</p>
</div>
<p>Rolopower has a unique USB power generating and storage technology. There are no moving gears or parts, so there is no drag.  It has been specifically designed to fit inside each wheel of the base trolley. So you have not one, but two dynamos for extra power and efficiency. They do not take up any of the valuable space inside the bag.</p>

<div><p><b style=""background-color: initial;"">The way it works:</b><br/></p></div></b>
<p>When you pull the Rolopower carry-on, the wheels rotate and immediately start generating electric power. This power is then stored in a large internal battery which is capable of recharging your phone several times.This way you can charge your phone anytime, even when you are not walking.<br/></p>
<p>You can also recharge the battery externally using a powered USB connection.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1054222/files/20141128132148-scene_02.jpg?1417209708"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>With a press of a button you can easily see the level of charge left in the internal battery. Also the LEDs will light up when you walk indicating that power is being generated and stored.</p>

<p>Whenever you need to recharge you phone, simply plug it in Rolopower<b> </b>USB port and continue on your journey.</p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>There is a convenient phone holder on top of the bag with a see through cover. This way you can plug your phone in and let it charge while you walk. The clear cover allows you to easily see if you have a call or a message.</p>

<p>Rolopower is really SMART. It comes with a free mobile app that connects with the Carry-on via Bluetooth. You can monitor the internal battery, your walking max/current/average speed. You can also keep track of the distance covered, distance to full charge and other smart features.</p>
<p>You will also need to know the distance you covered and upload it to our website if you wish to join the Rolopower Challenge... More about that later...</p>
<p>And for those smart geeks out there like ourselves, we decided to add the ability to check the status of each generator such as the RPM and voltage being generated. We thought it would be a nice engineering touch!<br/></p>
<h3>STAY TUNED! WE WILL BE INTRODUCING A LOT OF EXCITING NEW FEATURES TO THE APP.</h3>

<p>With Rolopower carry-on bag you can continue walking past all of the crowds and head straight to your gate, take a stroll or do your last minute shopping. A bit of walking before a long flight is good for you and helps the time pass more quickly.</p>
<p><b>DUMP </b>all the external batteries, power banks, chargers or other fancy bags with internal batteries. <b>WHY? </b>Because all batteries eventually run out of juice and need to be plugged into a power outlet. You don't have time for this, and no one wants the frustration of a dead battery! With the Rolopower carry-on, you have an endless power source at your disposal.</p>
<p>Go to your gate sooner with a charged phone.</p>
<p><b>RETAIN</b> your mobility. It is called a mobile phone after all. It is supposed to keep you mobile. This is true except for when it needs to be recharged, then it has to stay plugged into an outlet with you babysitting it. Well now you have green power generation at your disposal that will keep you and your phone mobile again.</p>
<p>Lets face it, airports are getting bigger and bigger and terminals are getting longer and longer. Why not use all that energy in walking for a useful purpose? Why not convert that green energy to charge our power-hungry mobile devices?</p>
<p>Also, after using many same-old boring carry-on bags and luggage, we thought ""why not come up with an innovative, smart, stylish and modern design"".</p>
<p>By combining an ingenious USB charging power features and stylish designs the <b>ROLOPOWER </b>idea was born.</p>

Blue Rolopower Prototype




On your next trip, take a Rolopower Carry-on bag with you and we promise that your phone will never run out of battery again.....EVER!



See all those people that are bogged down in airport lounges, crowded around the outlets charging their phones? Do you want to elbow your way around them? Do you want to fight for an outlet just to have to sit down to recharge? 
FORGET IT! Its bad enough that you are going to have to sit in a tight airplane seat next to a total stranger.

Rolopower has a unique USB power generating and storage technology. There are no moving gears or parts, so there is no drag.  It has been specifically designed to fit inside each wheel of the base trolley. So you have not one, but two dynamos for extra power and efficiency. They do not take up any of the valuable space inside the bag.





NO GEARS OR MOVING PARTS

Direct Drive Technology

The way it works:
When you pull the Rolopower carry-on, the wheels rotate and immediately start generating electric power. This power is then stored in a large internal battery which is capable of recharging your phone several times.This way you can charge your phone anytime, even when you are not walking.
You can also recharge the battery externally using a powered USB connection.


With a press of a button you can easily see the level of charge left in the internal battery. Also the LEDs will light up when you walk indicating that power is being generated and stored.




Whenever you need to recharge you phone, simply plug it in Rolopower USB port and continue on your journey.


There is a convenient phone holder on top of the bag with a see through cover. This way you can plug your phone in and let it charge while you walk. The clear cover allows you to easily see if you have a call or a message.



Rolopower works with all types and sizes of phones.You can also charge any USB rechargeable device - phones, tablets, or eBook readers too!



SMART CONNECTED APP



Rolopower is really SMART. It comes with a free mobile app that connects with the Carry-on via Bluetooth. You can monitor the internal battery, your walking max/current/average speed. You can also keep track of the distance covered, distance to full charge and other smart features.
You will also need to know the distance you covered and upload it to our website if you wish to join the Rolopower Challenge... More about that later...
And for those smart geeks out there like ourselves, we decided to add the ability to check the status of each generator such as the RPM and voltage being generated. We thought it would be a nice engineering touch!
STAY TUNED! WE WILL BE INTRODUCING A LOT OF EXCITING NEW FEATURES TO THE APP.



With Rolopower carry-on bag you can continue walking past all of the crowds and head straight to your gate, take a stroll or do your last minute shopping. A bit of walking before a long flight is good for you and helps the time pass more quickly.
DUMP all the external batteries, power banks, chargers or other fancy bags with internal batteries. WHY? Because all batteries eventually run out of juice and need to be plugged into a power outlet. You don't have time for this, and no one wants the frustration of a dead battery! With the Rolopower carry-on, you have an endless power source at your disposal.
Go to your gate sooner with a charged phone.
RETAIN your mobility. It is called a mobile phone after all. It is supposed to keep you mobile. This is true except for when it needs to be recharged, then it has to stay plugged into an outlet with you babysitting it. Well now you have green power generation at your disposal that will keep you and your phone mobile again.
Lets face it, airports are getting bigger and bigger and terminals are getting longer and longer. Why not use all that energy in walking for a useful purpose? Why not convert that green energy to charge our power-hungry mobile devices?
Also, after using many same-old boring carry-on bags and luggage, we thought ""why not come up with an innovative, smart, stylish and modern design"".
By combining an ingenious USB charging power features and stylish designs the ROLOPOWER idea was born.



Next time you go to the airport stop searching for that elusive power outlet. You don't need it!





Rolopower can come in a number of unique color accents once we hit our first stretch goal.
We are not calling it Rolopower innovative just because it can generate power and recharge your phone. Wait until you see the new features we want to add when we reach some of our stretch goals! You will see how truly innovative Rolopower really can be!!  More on Stretch Goals later!

<h1>What is ‘Tree Trauma’? </h1>
<p>Tree Trauma is a mobile app where you play as a squirrel, trying to climb a tree. Sounds simple? not quite, while climbing the tree you have to move from left to right and right to left to avoid falling apples. Pick up your IOS device and get ready because tree trauma will be jumping its way into the Apple app store by the end of April! Rack up a high score, Try out each character and get your reaction speed up because once you start playing this fun and addicting you’ll never stop! Want to give it a try? Currently Tree Trauma is in its late stages of development but we currently don’t have the resources to get the necessary licences and software to finish it off. Even a donation of $1 will help us finish this app and get it published to the Apple App Store as soon as possible.

<p>Developing games and apps, even small ones take time and money. You need software for programming, graphics and licences to put the app on the App Store. Since ZapdoMedia is a small company we do not have funding for a large amount of these products. Tree Trauma will be free on the App Store, and the only revenue we will earn is a small amount from advertising in the game. Although we don’t want to have to put adverts in the game, even with the Indiegogo campaign we still need funding to continue development of Tree Trauma to insure there are regular updates and to keep our small company alive. We really hope you can help with the creation of this game by contributing to this campaign. </p><p><br/></p> <div> <h3>

</div></div>","Optimal is an ultra-thin, high-end protection case that's designed to keep your smartphone in its ideal operating temperature. By constantly monitoring for temperature shifts and adjusting accordingly, Optimal makes sure your smartphone operates at maximum performance levels during any task or weather conditions. 




Optimal is designed to function as an active extension to your smartphone’s metal chassis and it is specifically planned from the ground up for each phone model by their individual thermal characteristics. The case measures just 5 mm/0.19 inches thin and is equipped with the latest in micro technology. 
To date, Optimal is the smartest way you can protect your smartphone, from the inside out.












__________________________________________________________________________


""Optimal is just
one way our devices are getting smarter, cooler and much better in performance
levels.""- iPhone Life magazine
""Up until now, it has been difficult to find a solution to such problems, though one company has managed to do just that."" - Topweb


""A great new product is in the making "" - Recognition


""Optimal letting you continue your work without any sudden off or hang of it, due to excess heat"" - Technoguide




_____________________________________________________________________________


In addition to Optimal sensors, the case syncs with your smartphone over Bluetooth and constantly analyses the phone's temperature. If it gets too hot, Optimal will cool your phone using the latest technology in micro-fans. These fans help the phone dissipate heat faster and cools down the device before it gets to the point of overheating.





Placing your smartphone in direct sun light will overheat your device to the point it fails. With Optimal case, you can now track and use multiple applications for long hours, your smartphone will never let you down.
















At an average temperature of 0°C (32°F), a lithium-ion battery will lose six per cent of its maximum capacity. At 25°C (77°F) degrees that number jumps to 20%. With Optimal’s unique approach, your battery is always kept at recommended operating temperatures. Don't carry bulky battery cases when you can utilize your own battery - in a smart way.




Playing a game requires a lot of resources from your phone’s CPU and graphics engine and heat builds up quickly during highly demanding tasks. Optimal micro fans are strategically placed in order to dissipate heat from key areas and eliminates the risk of overheating (SoC). Optimal case brings Mobile Gaming to a whole new level.


One of the most common effects of cold weather is battery drain. You may notice that your smartphone is losing charge quicker than usual, or it will suddenly go dead. Optimal is designed to sense the slightest temperature drop and will engage Anti-freeze heating coils to make sure your device and battery stays within the safe zone. With Optimal, your smartphone is protected from the cold. 










It doesn't matter what the conditions are, have no fear from the elements. Optimal’s unique IP56 certified breather grills blocks fine dust, small particles, rain, snow and water while allowing fresh air movement into the chassis for thermal management operation. 

 ____________________________________________________________________________







All the major manufacturers warn about using their smartphones in extreme temperatures and offer operational guidelines. For instance, Apple provides a temperature range of 0 to 35 degree Celsius for their devices and are not covered under warranty if you use it in conditions that are any colder or warmer. 
Extreme temperature will affect your smartphone by slowing down overall performance levels, degrading GPU & CPU, Battery lifespan, system shut downs and it could even cause permanent damage.






We believe that in 2015, our smartphones should keep up with our fast paced lives and ever changing weather. We decided to create the most advanced protection case ever made, and we're going to cut no costs in making it.
We approached the problem with the following goals in mind:








Our first mission was to make sure Optimal will allow your smartphone to operate at maximum performance levels and never fails, anywhere you go, in cold or hot climates, and during any task.



We designed Optimal to feel like it is an integrated part of your smartphone, and not just another phone cover. Every component was carefully chosen and tested in order to develop Optimal into a complete effective solution, while keeping it under 5mm.





Optimal can be ordered to fully protect your smartphone in one smart button click, (Ghost) and will only engage protection when sensing a temperature shift that could risk your device. if you are interested in a bit more, you can dive into Optimal dedicated application and control everything from independent fans rpm's to setting your own multiple safe zones.



_____________________________________________________________________________







_____________________________________________________________________________




Smartphones have a very different set of thermal constraints then your PC. If the device’s thermal threshold is suppressed, the SoC begins to throttle back its frequencies, and thus performance in efforts to reduce heat. The proximity of high power components and the material used in your smartphone to dissipate the heat are some of the methods employed by manufacturers to help cool down your device. 









Optimal is designed to work in the same manner and function as an active extension to your smartphone metal chassis. Using high thermal conductivity materials, boosted with our dead silent micro-fans and high accuracy sensors, Optimal makes sure your smartphone dissipates heat much faster, and the reason Optimal is designed and can be used on higher-end smartphones models only, that share the same metal chassis design. Optimal system and is incompatible and could never be used for lower-end, plastic or polycarbonate smartphones models.
_____________________________________________________________________________






While all other case manufacturers offer you drop and shock protection, We at Amited choose to take a different approach and create a true protection case, A case that will protect both, the delicate internals components and the external chassis of your smartphone.



_____________________________________________________________________________







_____________________________________________________________________________








At our current stage of development, we are offering Optimal for : 
Apple iPhone 5/5s, iPhone 6 and Samsung Galaxy S5*. 
with the following Anodized coating colors: 
Space grey, Natural silver and Champagne gold. 





* Samsung Galaxy S5 back cover should be removed when installing Optimal

 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________


Throughout the campaign and for our Indiegogo backers only, we will offer a limited version of Optimal in Copper. This is the case with the highest efficiency and is the most beautiful out of them all. Optimal in Copper is electronically treated with 3 layers of protective coating to the highest standards, in order to maintain the characteristics and the stunning looks of the case during continuous use.

<h3>Imagine Having a Magic Mirror in your Pocket, To Tell you How to Be the Fairest One of All</h3>

<p>Imagine a personal shopper following you everywhere on the web, but also in stores; you know what you like, he knows what fits you.</p>

<h3>Don’t You Want a Revolution?</h3>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><i>“We all want to change the world” (The Beatles)</i></p>
<p>Do you know the Blue Ocean strategy?</p>
<blockquote>“Blue oceans, in contrast, denote all the industries not in existence today – the unknown market space, untainted by competition. In blue oceans, demand is created rather than fought over. There is ample opportunity for growth that is both profitable and rapid. In blue oceans, competition is irrelevant because the rules of the game are waiting to be set. Blue ocean is an analogy to describe the wider, deeper potential of market space that is not yet explored.” (Wikipedia)</blockquote>
<p>Belooky fits into this powerful strategy: its activity does not yet exist, direct competition either.</p>
<p>By offering to individuals a free complete image consulting service online (immediate, available 24 / 24 and 7 / 7, with an unlimited access), Belooky is indeed about to disrupt the rules of image consultant trade.</p>
<p>At a glance, here are some of Belooky’s highlights :</p>

Do you know the Blue Ocean strategy?
“Blue oceans, in contrast, denote all the industries not in existence today – the unknown market space, untainted by competition. In blue oceans, demand is created rather than fought over. There is ample opportunity for growth that is both profitable and rapid. In blue oceans, competition is irrelevant because the rules of the game are waiting to be set. Blue ocean is an analogy to describe the wider, deeper potential of market space that is not yet explored.” (Wikipedia)
Belooky fits into this powerful strategy: its activity does not yet exist, direct competition either.
By offering to individuals a free complete image consulting service online (immediate, available 24 / 24 and 7 / 7, with an unlimited access), Belooky is indeed about to disrupt the rules of image consultant trade.
At a glance, here are some of Belooky’s highlights :



Get Rid of Whatever You Can’t Stand in your Appearance for Free
You don’t like your flat nose? Your big calves? Your straight hair? Your small size? Your thin lips? Belooky has an answer for each issue. All you have to do is to follow advice. Amazing, right?
Never forget Belooky's bet: being the first complete (face, silhouette, colors and style) virtual makeover website in real time, and totally free.
The Truth About Belooky Founders
Because makeover naturally fits into a ""human"" relationship between client and counselor, it's Eva Cordel, image consulting specialist and “Allure sur mesure” company founder, who welcomes visitors in her virtual private room, and reveals her secrets, know-how and advice.

On the scientific side (algorithms and automation), Cecile Duclos, a computer scientist fascinated by new technologies and challenges of all kinds, will be in control.

Two sisters involved in the same completely innovative project, with an international goal (French touch requires)!
See Belooky in Action
In 2013, we've been through a long creative process, from early concepts to online platform, and a variety of test handsets.
Launched in January 2014, Belooky already offers key services to individuals:  


Both simple and ergonomic, the website is optimized for desktop computers, laptops, tablets and smartphones.

You can yet take advantage of the first automatic detection functionalities, using your webcam or downloading a photo.
You can join the community, registration is free. As a VIP member, you have access to many exclusive benefits. A space is entirely dedicated to hairstyle, another one to eyeglasses.

Thousands of French Citizens Now are Satisfied with their Look – Who Never Thought They Could
And the first feedbacks are quite promising: in 14 months, Belooky won almost 16 000 users in France! With an average session length of 8 minutes, we can affirm that the interest is here.
That’s why we established a complete business plan, with its market research, detailed application development plan, financing plan and business model. And now, all we need is… YOU!
Where Your Money will Go?
“All the things I could do, if I had a little money” (ABBA)
After spending two years developing Belooky makeover platform, perfecting algorithms, testing, writing down our own business plan, we are finally “ready to roll”!
We’ll use the Indiegogo funds to fulfill all your dreams for expected deliveries between December 2015 and December 2016, and here's how:
We will create a powerful mobile application (Android, iOS, Windows Phone).
We will develop our platform adding a lot of amazing services.
We will do research in advanced technologies like facial recognition and augmented reality, to implement a real virtual “magic” mirror (on computers but also for mobiles). 
We will transform your smartphone into a handheld scanner to know in real time what colors show you at your best.
We will create a “magic” guide, following you anywhere you want (not only on Internet), helping you to choose clothing, shoes and glasses, to change haircut, to prepare a wedding, a romantic date or a job interview, or even to sort your wardrobe.
We will offer you the opportunity to know if you are well dressed and what is wrong with your outfit.
For all this, we will forge partnerships with fashion industry and welfare professionals, hairdressers, beauticians and opticians, in order to make our makeover services available for everybody everywhere, on Internet but also in real life (shops, beauty salons, supermarkets…).

Will You Help Us Embellish Your Life?
Belooky services are free for individuals and will always be free, because everyone should have control of his image. However, as we need individual contributors right now, we do have some special perks for them. Let discover those perks!

Belooky in The PressEva Cordel, the image consultant of Belooky and “Allure sur mesure” (she founded her own French agency in 2007), is regularly the subject of articles, TV shows and media reports. Here are some :

Excerpts :""The employer is not seeking to hire someone with the look of a supermodel, but someone with a neat appearance, in accordance with his profession. For the same job, he will often have several candidates with equal skills. In the end, their image will make the difference."" (Eva Cordel, in Maxi)""My mission? Highlight a person without resorting to surgery, through the revelation of a potential existing in each of us"" (Eva Cordel, in Brèves de Bordeaux)""We all have strengths that we can play to. While some will develop them naturally, others will leave them fallow. To remedy this situation, minor adjustments are often enough.” (Eva Cordel, in Ça m'intéresse)

<li><p>We are passionate about the design of SPARROW and we want this to be a product Macbook users will love to use. The campaign funding goal we set for this does not cover all the tooling, certification, production costs etc. The goal we set is to determine if there is enough interest in SPARROW to continue moving forward with us putting a lot of our own $$$ to cover the costs to manufacture and ship. </p></li>
<li><p>Since the USB Type C port is so new, we might have compatibility issues with other peripheral standards. Part of your contribution will be going to solve these potential problems before we ship the product to our backers. </p></li>
<li>
<p>The core SPARROW team has worked with manufacturers (ODMs/OEMs) for over 10 years. So this isn't our first rodeo. Our experience with creating products allows this campaign the best chance for on-time delivery. Why just a best chance and not 100%? Well, we would be lying if we could guarantee it. Life throws a tonne of randomness and obstacles so we have to respect that. Of course we will be working like crazy to deliver on-time. </p>

<p><b>Q: Why do I want the SPARROW DOCK?</b></p>
<p>A: Because it's freaking edgy! Pretty much all products for apple now have the apple design language.

<p></p>
<p><b><b>Q:</b> How many external monitors can connect to the SPARROW DOCK ?</b></p>

<p></p>
<p><b><b>Q:</b> What monitors are supported?</b></p>
<p>A: Monitors that support Mini Display Port or HDMI should have no problem working.</p>
<p><b><b>Q:</b> Does the SPARROW DOCK work with Thunderbolt Display?</b></p>
<p>A: No, the SPARROW DOCK does not work with Thunderbolt Display. (This needs to be firmed up.)</p>

<p>A: Sorry but at this time we only support one or the other. Not both at the same time.</p>
<p><b><b>Q:</b> Does the SPARROW DOCK need to be connected to an external power or does it work with the MacBook's USB-C?</b></p>
<p>A: Yes, the SPARROW DOCK uses its own provided power adapter to power all ports. </p>
<p><b><b>Q:</b> What are the specs for the SD card reader?</b></p>
<p>A: These are the specs:<br/></p>
<ul>
<li><p>SDHC/ SDXC support</p></li>

</div></div>","Now you have ports again.Sparrow connects the Macbook USB-C with the world you live in.Sparrow is a collaboration from a bunch of curious, fun loving, semi-crazy tech folks living and breeding all around the Bay Area, California. Team Sparrow currently works with or has worked with a tonne of companies including: Apple, Amazon LAB 126, Hitachi, CNET, ZDNET, G-Technology, Seagate, Western Digital, Boxbee, Handle, Blue Otter Corp, Roxio, Glam Media, Stanford Learning, Clever Solar, Reach Media, Shopping.com/eBay, etc... so yeah, we have some experience.As an old Greek philosopher — whose name we forgot, so maybe we'll leave it for your own Googling — once said: “The only constant is change.” In the longview, this is a positive concept; innovation leads to bigger and better things. In the short-term, though, it can be annoying as all hell. Take the new 12-inch, super-thin MacBook's maddening lone USB Type C port.// THE GOOD: The USB-Type C is one of those so-called “game-changers.” It adapts to all sorts of peripherals, is backwards-compatible with other USB ports, and has the potential to transfer data at incredible speeds while powering them at the same time! All the while using only using one port. Say hello to the new gold port standard.  // THE BAD: It's only one port. Quick! Look around at the myriad of devices you have plugged into your laptop right meow. Maybe an external monitor, external hard drive, SD card reader, perhaps a keyboard, how 'bout ethernet? Certainly, your power cord's also nearby if you're running low on juice. With the new 12” MacBook design, you're allowed one—and only one—of those input/outputs at a time and of course only if you purchase an adapter. With SPARROW, all you do is slide in your cool, new 12” MacBook into our badass, new dock. From there, it'll split into 7 different ports. SPARROW will support your external monitor, your external hard drive, your HDMI enabled device, SD cards, or charge any mobile device much faster than standard USB*. The point is, if you want to keep your desk clean/ free of clutter, have a much more efficient workflow, and you want to look awesome doing it, SPARROWS's your bird. *SPARROW DOCK supports 2.1 amp USB Type A chargingOf course we created SPARROW to be functional but we designed it to be different then anything the marketplace currently offers. We wanted to invoke sci-fi, anime, uniqueness, edginess, gaming, origami and wow.

We are passionate about the design of SPARROW and we want this to be a product Macbook users will love to use. The campaign funding goal we set for this does not cover all the tooling, certification, production costs etc. The goal we set is to determine if there is enough interest in SPARROW to continue moving forward with us putting a lot of our own $$$ to cover the costs to manufacture and ship. 
Since the USB Type C port is so new, we might have compatibility issues with other peripheral standards. Part of your contribution will be going to solve these potential problems before we ship the product to our backers. 

The core SPARROW team has worked with manufacturers (ODMs/OEMs) for over 10 years. So this isn't our first rodeo. Our experience with creating products allows this campaign the best chance for on-time delivery. Why just a best chance and not 100%? Well, we would be lying if we could guarantee it. Life throws a tonne of randomness and obstacles so we have to respect that. Of course we will be working like crazy to deliver on-time. 




Q: Why do I want the SPARROW DOCK?
A: Because it's freaking edgy! Pretty much all products for apple now have the apple design language. Go against the grain. Ours has the sci-fi / anime / origami / mech / edgy look that no one does anymore.
Q: Do we support worldwide shipping?  
A: Yep, we have options for both US and Worldwide shipping in the Perks section.
Q: Will the SPARROW DOCK include a USB-C to USB-C cable?
A: The Sparrow will not come with an included USB-C cable. The USB-C cable that comes with the 12” MACBOOK will be used for the SPARROW. However, depending on the funding amount we might include another one in a future stretch goal.

Q: How many external monitors can connect to the SPARROW DOCK ?
A: At the moment we support one external monitor, but we are working on functionality for two.
Q: Does the SPARROW DOCK charge your MacBook when docked?
A: Yep, the SPARROW DOCK is meant to be as convenient as possible. Just dock it and you are ready to go.
Q: What Mini Display Port version are you going to support?
A: The display port version we will be using is 1.2 and it supports 4k at 60hz.
Q: What USB standard are you supporting?
A: All the USB ports will be 3.0. One USB port will be 2.1 amps. This allows for much faster charging of your iphone/ipad or other mobile devices. 

Q: What monitors are supported?
A: Monitors that support Mini Display Port or HDMI should have no problem working.
Q: Does the SPARROW DOCK work with Thunderbolt Display?
A: No, the SPARROW DOCK does not work with Thunderbolt Display. (This needs to be firmed up.)

Q: Can I use the Mini Display Port and HDMI at the same time?
A: Sorry but at this time we only support one or the other. Not both at the same time.
Q: Does the SPARROW DOCK need to be connected to an external power or does it work with the MacBook's USB-C?
A: Yes, the SPARROW DOCK uses its own provided power adapter to power all ports. 
Q: What are the specs for the SD card reader?
A: These are the specs:

SDHC/ SDXC support
Up to 500 Mbps transfer rates

Q: Will there be a version of SPARROW for other Mac laptops?
A: Yes we plan on it! Visit us at www.sparrowdock.com and sign up for our updates. (of course we will not spam or sell your info) Or send an email to products@sparrowdock.com and let us know which version you want us to support. The 13” Macbook Pro Retina or 15” Macbook Pro Retina.
Q: What color choices do I have for my Sparrow? 
A: The choices are:



Standard Colors

<p>Flash Pack utilizes the same chemistry which is used in bulky <b><i>electric car batteries</i></b>. Now, you can use it for your mobile devices! The technology significantly increases charging speed, durability and reliability of the battery banks, combined with a slower rate of capacity loss (aka greater calendar life).</p>
<p>Flash Pack battery bank features a <b><i>3 times longer cycle life</i></b> compared to conventional lithium ion batteries. Even if you recharge it to full capacity on a daily basis, it will serve you for a minimum of 4 years.</p>
<p>Nano-phosphate battery chemistry used in Flash Pack is <b><i>environment friendly</i></b> because the lithium doesn't cause environmental hazards, unlike ordinary lead-acid or lithium polymer batteries. </p>
<p>Our product offers <b><i>improved safety features</i></b> and great performance in the toughest conditions by providing battery short circuit and fuse protection in the battery bank to safeguard the device and the user in case of unexpected voltage or current spikes. In addition, the battery bank has excellent abuse tolerance so it won’t be damaged easily even if you accidentally supply greater current.</p>

  Has any of this happened with you?


 

Technology has improved our lives by offering thousands of helpful devices. They are becoming smaller and more mobile: from huge desktops to laptops, onto tablets and smartphones, and now we have smart watches and glasses. Your smartphone isn't just a communication device any more. It is your business associate and an entertainment buddy. You take it everywhere you go. 
Too Many Apps Drain Your Battery   How often has your cellphone died in the middle of an urgent task?The reason is that you rely on a lot of applications that make your day to day work possible and those apps consume a huge chunk of your battery. And suddenly, we find ourselves powerless, and restricted by old-fashioned wires and proximity to the closest wall outlet; until now.  Here Is The Solution             Introducing Flash Pack - the new rapid-charging power bank. 
 Click Bellow to view the 3D version of Flash Pack. You can even view it through VR Headset. We Make Mobile Devices Truly MobileWe have found a great solution to “dead battery syndrome”. Flash Pack utilizes a 2500 mAh Lithium Nano Phosphate battery for a fast and full charging. Our technology reduces the charging period by up to ten times!The best thing about it is that you can use it to charge ANY of your devices! Flash Pack is a cross-platform and cross-device charger, equipped with auto-sense technology. Hence, it is compatible with Android, iOS and Windows Phones, or any other USB powered devices. Auto-sense technology automatically adjusts to a device’s needs for optimum charging. This simple, all-in-one solution makes Flash Pack the most versatile battery bank in the market.   Flash Pack can be re-charged by two modesFlash Pack employs a single fast charging rechargeable battery that can be charged by two methods: fast and conventional charging. The fast charging mode allows you to fully recharge the battery in 14 minutes. You can achieve this by charging the Flash Pack with any of the existing standard laptop chargers with the following specs:Output Voltage Range = 18 - 20 VOutput Current Range = 3 - 3.2 AThis is all you need to get enough power to, for example, recharge an iPhone 6s for one and a half times!Plug in your laptop chargerThe conventional mode uses the standard micro USB cable (1A), which takes about 2 hours to recharge the battery. You can utilize it as an emergency tool, when no laptop charger is available.Also charges from your phone chargerCampers, off-the-grid adventurers, and even ordinary travelers will appreciate the opportunity to charge their batteries super-fast, ensuring that all of their devices will remain active for several days. With the Flash Pack, you’ll never miss an important call, taking an unforgettable photo, or a chance to connect with friends, family, or colleagues.  How To Use ItPlug the charger into the port on Flash Pack, and it will begin to charge immediately. The indicators monitor the process by showing tri-colored LED: -less than 33% charged - red light-between 33% and 66% - yellow light-more than 66% charged – green light.After 14 minutes, just remove the battery bank and you are good to go! Charge your smartphones, tablets, or smart watches whenever they need some extra juice.Flash Pack is Supper Easy to useJust Plug in your device with your own charging cable and your device will instantly start charging Never again be on a short leash of your device’s charging cord. Free yourself with Flash Pack!    In The BoxWe understand that you might have a different connector than the one showed here, but we have got you covered. You would be asked to provide your preference for the charger tip that would sit on top of your existing laptop charger. The connector may that be a Mac charger or an HP/Dell, etc.    

Update! 


 Flash Pack Advantages
Flash Pack utilizes the same chemistry which is used in bulky electric car batteries. Now, you can use it for your mobile devices! The technology significantly increases charging speed, durability and reliability of the battery banks, combined with a slower rate of capacity loss (aka greater calendar life).
Flash Pack battery bank features a 3 times longer cycle life compared to conventional lithium ion batteries. Even if you recharge it to full capacity on a daily basis, it will serve you for a minimum of 4 years.
Nano-phosphate battery chemistry used in Flash Pack is environment friendly because the lithium doesn't cause environmental hazards, unlike ordinary lead-acid or lithium polymer batteries. 
Our product offers improved safety features and great performance in the toughest conditions by providing battery short circuit and fuse protection in the battery bank to safeguard the device and the user in case of unexpected voltage or current spikes. In addition, the battery bank has excellent abuse tolerance so it won’t be damaged easily even if you accidentally supply greater current.

<h3>Riscos e Obstáculos</h3>
</div>
</div><div> <p>Como em qualquer projecto, existe um risco associado. Um website sobre o Windows Mobile, um sistema operativo que possui uma fatia diminuta do mercado móvel, associado a um público alvo que se baseia apenas em Portugal, nos PALOP - principalmente o Brasil - e ainda na comunidade portuguesa no estrangeiro, exige que o projecto seja bem delineado de forma a se tornar numa referência a nível nacional. Só assim se tornará num projecto auto sustentável criando uma comunidade à volta dos diversos meios utilizados pelo Windows Mobile Portugal para a comunicação com os nossos leitores. Aqui fica essa promessa!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Como nos pode ajudar?</h3>
<div>A ajuda que mais queremos é uma: Que sejam leitores fidelizados ao nosso site. O nosso trabalho dia após dia tem como princípios a informação correcta, isenta e fidedigna sobre tudo aquilo que se passa no mundo Windows Mobile. </div>
<div>Existem, claro, outras maneiras de ajudar na sustentação de todo o nosso projecto. A publicidade que apresentamos nos nossos meios de comunicação são um mal necessário para que consigamos combater todos os custos associados ao nosso projecto, sejam eles de alojamento ou mesmo domínio. É importante salientar que nenhum membro da nossa equipa recebe remuneração, sendo todo o trabalho feito numa base de gosto e interesse em informar os nossos leitores da melhor forma possível.</div>

Um website sobre o Windows Mobile, um sistema operativo que possui uma fatia diminuta do mercado móvel, associado a um público alvo que se baseia apenas em Portugal, nos PALOP - principalmente o Brasil - e ainda na comunidade portuguesa no estrangeiro, exige que o projecto seja bem delineado de forma a se tornar numa referência a nível nacional. Só assim se tornará num projecto auto sustentável criando uma comunidade à volta dos diversos meios utilizados pelo Windows Mobile Portugal para a comunicação com os nossos leitores. Aqui fica essa promessa!

    Como nos pode ajudar?
A ajuda que mais queremos é uma: Que sejam leitores fidelizados ao nosso site. O nosso trabalho dia após dia tem como princípios a informação correcta, isenta e fidedigna sobre tudo aquilo que se passa no mundo Windows Mobile. 
Existem, claro, outras maneiras de ajudar na sustentação de todo o nosso projecto. A publicidade que apresentamos nos nossos meios de comunicação são um mal necessário para que consigamos combater todos os custos associados ao nosso projecto, sejam eles de alojamento ou mesmo domínio. É importante salientar que nenhum membro da nossa equipa recebe remuneração, sendo todo o trabalho feito numa base de gosto e interesse em informar os nossos leitores da melhor forma possível.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<li>How can I leave a tag on anything that will not expire or change even when I change my contact information or travel?</li>
<li>How can I be anonymously notified without exposing my identity or contact information?</li>
<li>How can I leave specific messages for each physical ""notification tag"" and also update the messages?</li>
<li>How can I leave crucial medical information for easy access in the event of an emergency?</li>

<li>It allows you to leave specific messages for visitors to your home (delivery person, friends, repairman, or anyone who needs access while you are away).</li>
<li>Lost &amp; found - Post a ReachMe QR Code on luggage tag, pet or a child's school bag.</li>
<li>For the retail shop owner, office worker, warehouse manager, medical staff and just about anyone who needs to be reached when they are away from their usual location or outside of office hours the ReachMe LiveTag service allows customers and patients to connect with you without surrendering your personal contact information.</li>
<li>Allow emergency response personnel to quickly access a person's critical medical information and contact friends and families.</li>
<li>You want your clients or customers to be able to reach you outside of office hours, but do not want to give out your mobile phone number.</li>

How can I leave a tag on anything that will not expire or change even when I change my contact information or travel?
How can I be anonymously notified without exposing my identity or contact information?
How can I leave specific messages for each physical ""notification tag"" and also update the messages?
How can I leave crucial medical information for easy access in the event of an emergency?
How Does ReachMe Work?You register as a ReachMe user with an ID.The ReachMe administration allows you to configure how you can be reached through:
NousLogic ReachMe App (via push notification message)
Social media messaging
Chat with GPS support
Email (future release)
Phone call
SMS (future release)
You then post a QR Code generated by the ReachMe web application on anywhere that you expect to be notified.Anyone looking for you can then simply scan the QR Code to contact you and then the web application will prompt the person to type in a message. The NousLogic server will then locate you through Push Notification. If you are using NousLogic App, you will then be able to communicate back (through chat service) with the person looking for you without exposing your personal contact information.What Can You Do with ReachMe LiveTag?Here are just a few of the examples of what you can do with the ReachMe LiveTag app and service:
It allows an emergency response personnel to contact the user if he is not at home in case of emergency (home fire or maintenance issues such as a power outage or fallen tree).
It allows you to leave specific messages for visitors to your home (delivery person, friends, repairman, or anyone who needs access while you are away).
Lost & found - Post a ReachMe QR Code on luggage tag, pet or a child's school bag.
For the retail shop owner, office worker, warehouse manager, medical staff and just about anyone who needs to be reached when they are away from their usual location or outside of office hours the ReachMe LiveTag service allows customers and patients to connect with you without surrendering your personal contact information.
Allow emergency response personnel to quickly access a person's critical medical information and contact friends and families.
You want your clients or customers to be able to reach you outside of office hours, but do not want to give out your mobile phone number.
You have a vacation rental property and ReachMe service allows your visitor to reach someone if there is any emergency where they can not access the property or reach the rental office.

Your desk no longer needs to be simplistic. Now, with Deskbloks, you can make it larger, smaller, you can rotate it, make it fit any of your walls, add new bloks with some cool gadgets that will save your space, etc.If you want to use Deskbloks as a regular desk, no problem, you can use just regular bloks. But if you need USB ports, for example, then you can use bloks with USB ports. Hey, but what about a speaker? Maybe you don’t have enough room on your desk or you simply hate the cables. No problem - in that case, you can use bloks with a USB speaker built-in.In today’s modern times, you probably own a smartphone. We thought of that as well, with bloks that have wireless charger built-in.What about cables for your PC or a laptop? All our bloks are designed with cable management in mind, that’s why we created channels in bloks and holes in desk legs for cables to pass through. Cable mess behind your desk is history!At the moment, there are 5 different bloks that we created. With your help and if the crowdfunding campaign proves to be a success, we will create additional bloks.Some of you will even get a chance to design their own bloks.The great thing about that is - you earn percentage of profit from sales of that particular bloks, as long as that bloks keeps selling! Possibilities for bloks are endless.                  Currently, for our prototype, we are only using one type of wood - the Croatian oak, but in the future, we will allow our customers to choose between more types of wood, depending on their preferences of desk color, structure and design. Our bloks are connectable in all directions, providing for infinite possibilities. It takes less than a few minutes to connect 6 types of bloks, together with legs, into a fully functional desk.The process is easy:
Pick your bloks, then group and arrange them as you wish
Put them on the backside
Use our metal plates and screws to secure them together
Add legs
Done
The same process is used for adding new bloks and reversed for disassembly.It's practical and easy to transport it.Perfect cable management.All future orders will be goin through our web shop where you will have online configurator that will help you to create your perfect desk.The idea of Deskbloks goes a few years back. We saw Dave Hakkens, a Dutch designer and his concept of a modular mobile phone - Phonebloks, and later Project Ara from Google, with a similar design.We decided that we wanted to build a modular PC case, but that proved to be challenging, so we came to an idea to build a modular desk.First it was supposed to be only a simple case/desk, but one day I played Lego with my little cousin and we built a desk out of Legos. That’s when I came to an idea for Deskbloks (the name came later).After some research on the Web, we saw that no one has made anything like it. One day we were watching Lord of the Rings at our friend’s house and talked about this idea. They liked it, and one of the friends shouted “One desk to rule them all!”We liked it and stuck to that motto till today.After that, we started working on Deskbloks. In our first versions we used cheap wood but soon discarded it since it proved not to be up to our desired quality level. We decided that from now on, we’ll only be using a good, hard wood, resistant to wear by time, weather conditions, and temperatures and chose to go with the world famous Croatian oak.During the production time, we usually get ideas for new bloks, but since we don’t have our own CNC machinery, we had to pay others to make them for us, which had impact on our budget and we were thus able to produce only 5 different bloks.Build to last.Our team now counts 2 members only.

<p>Du möchtest eine Fremdsprache lernen, ohne lästiges Vokabeln pauken und Grammatik büffeln? Mit jetMovie lernst du <strong>gehirn-gerecht, effizient und vor allem mit mehr Spaß!</strong></p>
<p><i>You want to learn a new language without cramming of vocabularies and grammar? <br/>With jetMovie you'll learn <strong>brain-suitable, more effective and with more fun!</strong></i></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>So funktioniert's </strong></h3>
<h3><i>How it works</i></h3>
<p><br/><strong>Die Birkenbihl-Methode</strong><br/>Vera F. Birkenbihl war Bestsellerautorin und eine der erfolgreichsten Managementtrainerinnen Deutschlands. Über 20 Jahre lang beschäftigte sie sich mit dem Sprachenlernen. Dabei entwickelte sie eine Methode, mit der ihre unzähligen Schüler verblüffende Erfolge erzielten.</p>
<div>
<div> </div>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/225667382?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
</div>
<p><strong>Das Erfolgsgeheimnis der Methode:</strong><br/>Gehirn-gerecht: So wie es unser Gehirn will. Neues Entdecken, Zusammenhänge verstehen und Interessantes, sich merken. So wie wir die Muttersprache gelernt haben.  Und jetzt machen wir es mit Filmen. Das ist (fast) so wie es selbst erlebt zu haben, wie ein Aufenthalt im fremden Land. Intuitiv. Die ""De-Kodierzeile"" (Oben ist die Fremdsprache, unten die Wort-für-Wort Übersetzung) hilft uns die Bedeutung der Fremdsprache zu verstehen, anstatt mühevollem Vokabeln pauken.</p>
<p><i><strong>The Birkenbihl Approach, </strong></i><i><strong>Language learning made easy!​</strong><br/>The Birkenbihl Approach is based on study results from neuroscience and social sciences. The idea is to learn a foreign language just like you have learned your own mother tongue. Children learn their mother tongue completely intuitively – without any cramming of vocabs or grammar rules. Adults should learn the same way as children, with the only difference to use their abilities to read, listen carefully and compare a foreign language to the mother tongue.</i></p>

<i>jet</i>Movie – Sprachen lernen mit Filmen</h3>
<h3><i><strong>jetMovie – learning languages by entertainment</strong></i></h3>
<p><strong>Es geht noch mehr: Sprachkurse mit TV-Filmen!</strong><br/>Seit knapp 2 Jahren sind die ersten Episoden (Folgen) in Englisch und Spanisch verfügbar. Alle User fragen nach mehr. Weil's lustig und erfolgreich ist. Sprache lernen und Filme sehen!</p>
<p><strong>There is one more thing:  Language Courses using Movies!</strong><br/><i>Five so-called jetMovies are already available, and the project plans to release 64 new films in the near future (next 3 month) in German, English, French and Spanish. Episodes of the television show Discovery Extra are already licensed and ready to be used. </i></p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/223771171?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Jetzt im Crowdfunding Angebot: </strong><br/>  * 64 neue Episoden (Folgen) in<br/>  * 4 Sprachen (EN,ES,FR,DE)<br/>  * 1700 Minuten Lern-Spaß<br/>  * Mega-Preis-Reduktion (bis zu -45% vom regulären Verkaufspreis)</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/171369001?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
<p>Vera F.Birkenbihl – Zitat nach der Vorstellung der ersten marktfähigen Englisch-Kurse (2009): <i>""Ja das ist gut, so kann man mit dem Computer erstmals wirklich eine Sprache lernen! Und jetzt machen Sie das ganze noch mit Filmen! Ein Blockbuster enthält mehr als 1200 Wörter (Wortschatz) damit können Sie die Sprache perfekt lernen. Sehr gut, darauf freue ich mich!""</i></p>
<p><i>We used The Birkenbihl Approach successfully with our Linguajet courses for years. Now we go even further: Using TV and movies as a learning strategy!</i></p>
<p><strong><i>To summarize it: you get to watch funny movies in a foreign language, including a “karaoke”-like program called jetline, three times a day for ten-minutes. After six weeks, you’ll speak a new language effortlessly!</i></strong></p>
<p><i><strong>Together we can realize jetMovies in all languages – to make language learning so easy like never before.</strong></i></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Lerne  wann, wo und wie oft du möchtest!</h3>
<h3><i>Learning when, where and how often you want!</i></h3>
<p>Bestimme deinen Lernerfolg. Dieser ist garantiert und hängt nur von der Anzahl Ihrer Übungen ab. Jeder kann so eine (oder mehrere - auch gleichzeitig) Fremdsprachen lernen.</p>
<p><strong>Beispiel Ihres Lernerfolges:<br/>  * 6 Wochen lang lustige Filme ansehen<br/>  * 3 x 10 Minuten pro Tag genügen<br/>  = Fremdsprache erlernt! </strong></p>

You want to learn a new language without cramming of vocabularies and grammar? With jetMovie you'll learn brain-suitable, more effective and with more fun!
 
So funktioniert's 
How it works
Die Birkenbihl-MethodeVera F. Birkenbihl war Bestsellerautorin und eine der erfolgreichsten Managementtrainerinnen Deutschlands. Über 20 Jahre lang beschäftigte sie sich mit dem Sprachenlernen. Dabei entwickelte sie eine Methode, mit der ihre unzähligen Schüler verblüffende Erfolge erzielten.

 

 

Das Erfolgsgeheimnis der Methode:Gehirn-gerecht: So wie es unser Gehirn will. Neues Entdecken, Zusammenhänge verstehen und Interessantes, sich merken. So wie wir die Muttersprache gelernt haben.  Und jetzt machen wir es mit Filmen. Das ist (fast) so wie es selbst erlebt zu haben, wie ein Aufenthalt im fremden Land. Intuitiv. Die ""De-Kodierzeile"" (Oben ist die Fremdsprache, unten die Wort-für-Wort Übersetzung) hilft uns die Bedeutung der Fremdsprache zu verstehen, anstatt mühevollem Vokabeln pauken.
The Birkenbihl Approach, Language learning made easy!​The Birkenbihl Approach is based on study results from neuroscience and social sciences. The idea is to learn a foreign language just like you have learned your own mother tongue. Children learn their mother tongue completely intuitively – without any cramming of vocabs or grammar rules. Adults should learn the same way as children, with the only difference to use their abilities to read, listen carefully and compare a foreign language to the mother tongue.
 

jetMovie – Sprachen lernen mit Filmen
jetMovie – learning languages by entertainment
Es geht noch mehr: Sprachkurse mit TV-Filmen!Seit knapp 2 Jahren sind die ersten Episoden (Folgen) in Englisch und Spanisch verfügbar. Alle User fragen nach mehr. Weil's lustig und erfolgreich ist. Sprache lernen und Filme sehen!
There is one more thing:  Language Courses using Movies!Five so-called jetMovies are already available, and the project plans to release 64 new films in the near future (next 3 month) in German, English, French and Spanish. Episodes of the television show Discovery Extra are already licensed and ready to be used. 

 
Jetzt im Crowdfunding Angebot:   * 64 neue Episoden (Folgen) in  * 4 Sprachen (EN,ES,FR,DE)  * 1700 Minuten Lern-Spaß  * Mega-Preis-Reduktion (bis zu -45% vom regulären Verkaufspreis)

 
Vera F.Birkenbihl – Zitat nach der Vorstellung der ersten marktfähigen Englisch-Kurse (2009): ""Ja das ist gut, so kann man mit dem Computer erstmals wirklich eine Sprache lernen! Und jetzt machen Sie das ganze noch mit Filmen! Ein Blockbuster enthält mehr als 1200 Wörter (Wortschatz) damit können Sie die Sprache perfekt lernen. Sehr gut, darauf freue ich mich!""
We used The Birkenbihl Approach successfully with our Linguajet courses for years. Now we go even further: Using TV and movies as a learning strategy!
To summarize it: you get to watch funny movies in a foreign language, including a “karaoke”-like program called jetline, three times a day for ten-minutes. After six weeks, you’ll speak a new language effortlessly!
Together we can realize jetMovies in all languages – to make language learning so easy like never before.
 
Lerne  wann, wo und wie oft du möchtest!
Learning when, where and how often you want!
Bestimme deinen Lernerfolg. Dieser ist garantiert und hängt nur von der Anzahl Ihrer Übungen ab. Jeder kann so eine (oder mehrere - auch gleichzeitig) Fremdsprachen lernen.
Beispiel Ihres Lernerfolges:  * 6 Wochen lang lustige Filme ansehen  * 3 x 10 Minuten pro Tag genügen  = Fremdsprache erlernt! 

 
 
Alle Vorteile auf einen Blick: That's what it makes unique!

Can you tell which tire is underinflated just by looking? The Dangerous Facts About Underinflated Tires:  Meet the ZUS Smart Tire Safety Monitor. With ZUS, you no longer have to guess what's wrong with your tires. View individual tire pressure data directly on your smartphone for a safer drive and improved gas mileage. Powered by an intelligent algorithm, ZUS warns you of any slow leaks before they become a serious problem. It's perfect for your 4-wheel drive or pickup truck.  Top auto vlogger, Chris Fix, takes the ZUS Smart Tire Safety Monitor for a spin. Click to start watching.

All our products undergo rigorous testing before release, including several rounds of Beta testing. Here are comments from some of our Beta testers.
 A set of 4 sensors, one for each tire, detects tire temperature and pressure data in real-time.Data passes wirelessly through the in-car receiver and instantly appears on the ZUS app through Bluetooth. The receiver will blink and sound off an alarm whenever an issue is detected.View individual tire pressures (as PSI/kPa/Bar) and temperatures (°F/°C) directly on your smartphone. Get app notifications whenever things look abnormal. Why Slow Leaks Are Hard to DetectSlow leaks caused by tire punctures from screws are hard to detect because the leakage rate is often too low (i.e. ~0.1% PSI per hour).

</div></div>","Introducing the Mu Two - the World's thinnest international USB Type-C fast charger, and our most powerful Mu wall charger yet. Simultaneously charge your devices with the dual USB Type-C ports. Designed with a primary USB C port for the latest compatible Type-C charged laptops, and secondary USB C port for tablets and smartphones. The Mu Two has a fixed split to share the 63W maximum power output to make it more useful for your daily charging needs. Though capable of 63W output, we guarantee that port #1 will always be able to deliver 45W to charge a Type-C PD compatible laptop when the secondary port is in use. Therefore, the maximum output of port #2 is 18W which is plenty to charge tablets and smartphones.  One charger, Two USB Type-C ports
 This next generation USB Type-C 63W charger is more powerful than its predecessor - it charges Type-C laptops including the latest Macbooks and notebooks, as well as all tablets and smartphones.Designed to charge Type-C, Micro USB and Lightning charged devices. Simply plug in to the wall and then use a Type-C to C cable, C to Micro USB cable or C to Lightning cable to your devices.
 

Charge a Type-C charged laptop, and a smartphone (or tablet) simultaneously Under the Hood:
 Gallium Nitride Technology (GaN) Technology - Enabling very high-power in a super small space, all with over 90% efficiency. This technological breakthrough in power is the real genius under the hood, enabling us to provide big power in our tiny Mu Two.
 Power Delivery (PD) Technology - Fast charge, adaptive charge, quick charge – it’s all about being able to change the voltage output of the charger to adjust to devices and create a quick charging experience. The Mu Two comes with a PD controller onboard and will charge fast. 
 Quick Charge (QC) compliant - As well as PD technology, the Mu Two is also Quick Charge compatible for QC enabled devices.
 Auto-Detect Chip - Providing intelligent identification to iOS, Android and other devices to ensure that they charge at an optimum rate. The Mu Two provides the perfect charge no matter which device, make or model is being used, upto 63W.

Risks and challenges
Our small design team first successfully launched our UK version of the Mu in 2012 and since then we've continued to design and build a Mu family, whilst expanding to an international audience.
So, this isn't our first rodeo. In fact it's our 4th major product launch - previously we've successfully raised around $500K through crowd funding projects, have won numerous industry awards and we don't settle for second best!
Having run campaigns like this before we know that timelines can occasionally slip, but we have taken time to develop this next generation product and we have full confidence in our timescales, new manufacturing base and ability to roll out a first class product!
Saying that, as we have done this before, and we know that nothing is plain sailing! We have added some contingency into our timescales for the inevitable random item that we can't predict right now, but we know is coming.
We have a manufacturer already engaged and our enthusiasm is hitting the high notes.

<p>It was built to address the privacy concerns we all have about our personal information like mobile number, email address, real name, etc... </p>
<p>We wanted a solution for this issue, therefore we thought, planned, designed and engineered this state of the art application and wanted to share it with the world. </p>

<p>The app is currently running on Android market places (Google Play store), we got 220'000 downloads in the first 45 days. Amazing right?!</p>
<p>This idea is being developed and maintainted by a group of engineers and developers to ensure the best quality possible. Maintenance and development require new hardware, software, manhelp and many other expensive things. </p>
<p>We can fund the project but we need your help. We want to develop the iOS and Windows Phone versions to make sure that this is available to most smartphone users.</p>
<p>The current funding target - if met - will keep us moving for the next 6 months!</p>

</div></div>","What is TexyFi?

TexyFi is a new messaging app for smartphones.


It was built to address the privacy concerns we all have about our personal information like mobile number, email address, real name, etc... 
We wanted a solution for this issue, therefore we thought, planned, designed and engineered this state of the art application and wanted to share it with the world. 



You don't need to share your mobile number to use it.


You don't need to share your name. 


All your messages are encrypted and only you have access to them.


The app is currently running on Android market places (Google Play store), we got 220'000 downloads in the first 45 days. Amazing right?!
This idea is being developed and maintainted by a group of engineers and developers to ensure the best quality possible. Maintenance and development require new hardware, software, manhelp and many other expensive things. 
We can fund the project but we need your help. We want to develop the iOS and Windows Phone versions to make sure that this is available to most smartphone users.
The current funding target - if met - will keep us moving for the next 6 months!
The most powerful 3 features of TexyFi are:


Encryption of messages
Protection of privacy
Translation of messagesRead below for more details..





Powerful protection of messages

 
Complete privacy: you don't need a mobile number

 
Meet friends: chat with users from around the glob using the coolest map everA user can search of fellow TexyFi-ers aroud the world. Select the country and hit the green button, a grid of images will illustrate the results. Search can be refined using gender or Pin. A pin is a unique 8-digits number assigned to each user to be used of identification. It can be used to invite or call using the upcoming voice call service. No mobile number is required! Here is a snapshot taken from an Android device running TexyFi:



Instant translation: you can chat with anyone no matter what their language was

<p>2. <b>An Alternative Theory of Economics</b></p>
<p>It took me the better part of 18 years to develop an alternative theory of economics that was based upon probability theory and wave theory. This theory explained the difference between inflation and hyperinflation, showed the relationship between Demand and Supply and Inflation. Also showed that probability can be greater than 1 or 100% and invented group (or crowd) probability theory. It showed that economies experience oscillations or business cycles and if we could identify these oscillations we could predict stock and commodity trends up to 2 to 3 years into the future. The main equations developed were:-</p>
<p>M(z) = W(z) + I(z) + N(z) ... Market Behaviour<br/></p>
<p>and <br/></p>
<p>D - S = kI ... the relationship between Demand, Supply and Inflation <br/></p>
<p>Was awarded a Doctorate in Economics for developing this theory.</p>

The data used is based upon one closing price data per month. On 12th December 2012, when the Brent Crude prices was 
$110, I had published my prediction that Brent Crude price would peak in
 2013 and then drop by 2014. <br/><p></p>

it dropped further. When I published my charts in December 2012, no one was expecting the 
price to drop, in fact most people thought my predictions were wrong and
 Brent Crude prices would hold at around $110 forever. Amazing. May be I should have done a little more analysis to show how the price would behave into 2015 or 2016. I was 
predicting Brent Crude price trends one and a half years into the 
future. Did I make history?

Of course some fund managers got it into their head that their duty was to spend millions to ensure the spike did to occur so the top of the spike was flattened.<br/><br/>As you can see from <a href=""http://www.macrotrends.net/1470/historical-silver-prices-100-year-chart"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.macrotrends.net/1470/historical-silv...</a> and select the 5 year chart option you will see that the actual silver price peaked in August 2011.

<p>It is truly an amazing price prediction as I had tried to predict the rapeseed price trend up to 3 years ahead.

I expected the rapeseed price to rally after that. The rally came a little earlier than expected. What is amazing is that the prediction trend shows that rapeseed price falls in 2012. That is almost 2 to 3 years ahead I was predicting that the rapeseed prices fall. The price has been falling since 2012 until end of 2014!

<b>Soybean Price Trend Prediction</b><br/><br/>I must admit that I may have done this soybean price prediction erroneously and I did not go back to update the prediction.

<h2>The Perks and what you get</h2>1. <b>Short Stories : Perfect Love</b><br/><br/><p>This
 book, PDF version to be emailed, ""Perfect Love and Other Stories"", was 
written around 1996 / 1997 when I was stuck with some mathematical 
problems. Writing the book was an emotional roller coaster ride and I 
enjoyed every minute of it. <br/><br/>My stories are true fiction. They range from soppy mushy romances to 
ghost and horror stories. I even have some science fiction and ghost 
stories.  Some are really funny fiction and others are horrid. Many have
 a moral behind the story … if you can find them. Most are set in 
Malaysia but there are some stories set in Japan, UK (...errrrr...almost 
partially ) and Singapore. Much of my fiction is twisted. You will know 
what I mean when you read the book. By the way, many of the stories are 
of mature content so I don’t think they are suitable for children.<br/><br/>I
 tested out my short stories on friends and strangers before deciding 
to publish them hence they clearly have a reasonably high standard of 
narration … at least with respect to the people I tested them on. 
Actually, while I was field testing my short stories I found out that 
the girls tended to cry but the guys tended to laugh at the

<p> This
 is a 39 page book, PDF version to be emailed, ""My Secret Techniques to 
Forecast the Stock Market"", on some of my 'secret' and original 
techniques to forecasting the stocks and commodity trends. I wrote this 
later after I published my first book, ""Market Theories &amp; Predicting
 the Stock Market by Visual Inspection"". The main idea was to add a 
summary of my techniques and additional simplified methods that I had 
overlooked in the first book. It includes words of advise before you try
 any trading, some of my personal anecdotes and different methods I had 
developed over the years.</p>

<p>4. Predicting Stocks, Commodities
This book, softcover to be posted by registered mail, covers my 
research work in economics and is an extension of my doctoral thesis. 
Its a revolutionary different approach to modeling in Economics and uses
 Probability Theory and Wave Theory to explain many economic phenomena. I
 have explained the maths so that non mathematical readers can 
understand the essence of the theories and models and apply them to the 
Visual Inspection Techniques I had developed. The theory goes on to 
explain why stocks and commodities are predictable and how to predict 
them by visual inspection. You can even enter your trend data into Excel
 worksheets and generate the predictions. </p>
<p>My first public 
prediction, shown below, was done in 1998 during the Asian Financial 
Crisis. That was the year I began publishing my charts.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1450147572/szaqxt7mbxou521hvz8d.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3><b><b><b>The 4 month training course
</b></b></b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>I have not used these theories and models to predict Forex trends. 
It's 
not easy to predict charts if you are a novice at reading trends. You 
will need a lot of practice and patience. The training course includes 
my book ""Market Theories &amp; Predicting the Stock Market by Visual 
Inspection"" and my time 
and labour to answer your questions over the next 4 months after getting
 the book. That would include helping you with your questions and 
helping you predict 2 to 4 charts per 
month. The book explains how to select stocks or commodities 
that are predictable and having understood the methods I had developed, 
shows you how to forecast price trends one or more years into the 
future. You will need to enter the price data into a Excel work sheet 
and massage the data to generate the predictions.</p>
<p>Your Requirements: 
</p>
<p>1. You will need to supply the data for the charts you need help with prediction 
</p>
<p>2. From a mathematical point of view you need to know what are sine 
and cosine functions. These are school level mathematics, 
trigonometrical functions -sine, cosine tangent to be able to use Visual
 Inspection Methods to predict the markets. Do purchase the 4 month 
training course if you meet the above two requirements.</p>
<p>Some of the contents of the book is shown in the video below.

</p>
<p>I have only a limited amount of books, about 50 books, printed for 
this 
training course. After that I doubt I will print anymore books as I need
 to focus on my anti hacking software sales and marketing. <br/></p>

<h3>Crowd Funding for The Bad Bot Exterminator for WordPress blogs</h3> <p>The Bad Bot Exterminator, with its proprietary engine, has a unique way to identify and block hackers and bad bots from attacking your WordPress websites. It took under three years of development and testing to launch this powerful anti hacking PHP software. It is so good that even DoS (Denial of Service) attacks failed to crash my WordPress website. <br/></p>
<p>My bread making blog is at <a href=""http://bachutha.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://bachutha.com</a>, and many hackers from Russia, Ukraine, Moldova, France, Germany, USA, Canada, Turkey and China continuously attack my blog every day, every year. As a result, during 2011 to 2013, my web hosting server was overloaded trying to meet the demand for webpages to be viewed by these hackers and the site slowed down considerably. Some days no one could view my website and as a result my visitor count dropped from 1200 per day to 200 per day. Worst still my website pagerank dropped from 4 to 2. So after two years of hacker attacks I decided to do something about it and developed the Bad Bot Exterminator.</p>
<br/><p><b>Always monitor the activity around your website</b><br/></p>
<p>Originally, I was monitoring my other website manually by checking the visitor statistics daily.  Actually, you will not know if your website was attacked until you check the historical data.<br/>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444372464/f8r49d1ij8fcdfs2uxds.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>As you can see from the data above, there was nothing I could do about it but just watch them attack my sites. <br/></p>
<p>The hosting services provide Awstats and Webalizer for you to monitor the activity on your website. Awstats does removes bot activity from the data so you will never know how many bots are visiting or attacking your site. Webalizer should show you all the data, whether its bot or human activity but it is difficult to manually go through all the data to determine if they were bots or human visitors.<br/></p>
<p>It was for this reason I developed the The Bad Bot Exterminator, a anti hacking software firewall, to block hackers as they came in for the attack. This meant that I did not have to look helplessly at the data after the attacks occurred. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>You will never know how severely your site is under attack</b><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444372666/lswcffr8mzzitcqty6z3.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Here was my e-commerce cart under attack. They attacked this site 28 million times in a single day.<br/><p><br/></p>
<p><b>The Bad Bot Exterminator defends against DDoS attacks successfully</b><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444373357/y9y18ts9prty8fgmyr2b.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>The table above shows how successfully my website was protected during the DDoS attack that lasted 9 days. That is a very long period of time to be under an attack. The attack was carried out by a large multinational corporation and yet no one noticed the attack. My WordPress website was running as if all was well with the world.<br/><br/><br/><b>Websites are attacked very often<br/></b>Our websites are attacked more often then we think as most of us are not monitoring visitor activity of our sites on a regular basis.<br/><br/>We never know when our websites will be attacked by hackers. In most cases, based on my experience, about 10% to 30% of our webpages are attacked by hackers looking for weaknesses. <br/><p><br/></p>

This is because the cache accelerator is built into the Bad Bot Exterminator. Together you WordPress webpages run about 100% to 300% faster. This means your visitors and Google will notice the performance difference. <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1451696356/wa7ramn4yhtp8xn7qvbg.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

I am not allowed to apply for patents in Malaysia. In 1998 / 1999 I applied for a patent but the patent office held back my applications for 7 years, until 2005. This means my patent applications are blocked.</p>
<p>2. In 2011, my house was robbed and my computer was stolen. They took all the backups drives and CD's. There was about 20 years of research work in my computer. This work involved unpublished mathematical models on product pricing and other works.<br/></p>

<p>The police refused to check for fingerprints. In Malaysia everyone, the locals and foreign workers, are issued Identity Cards with their fingerprints stored in the chip and government databases. This means that with the fingerprint, offenders can be identified within seconds. Many of my friends suspected that very powerful people were involved in the theft and that was why the police did not check for fingerprints.<br/></p>
<p>3. In 2015, the bank blocked my debit card from being used to make payments overseas, to Google and my hosting accounts. When I complained to the bank, they froze my account and I could not withdraw any funds from my account. It is frightening what the banks are now doing. I have found missing money and extra money in many banks over the last 7 years and the banks are in denial of this.<br/></p>
<p>4. In January 2016, the Inland Revenue department is now claiming I had earned a huge amount of money between 1992 and 1997 (fictitious figures - this is what powerful people can do behind the scenes) and want to take me to court to declare me a bankrupt. I was broke during this period and worked temporary jobs, like waiter &amp; typist, to fund my research. I have since written a 26 page letter to the Inland Revenue Service.</p>
<p>5. I suspect that my emails are monitored and many times I am blocked from accessing my websites. I had complained to my hosting provider in London and they said that the problem was coming from the Malaysian side.<br/></p>
<p><br/>I blogged about the first two situations at <a href=""http://drpetersnews.com/problems-problems-and-more-problems.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://drpetersnews.com/problems-problems-and-more-problems.html</a>. I do not know why very powerful people want to destroy my work. I have been under constant attacks, over the last 18 years, by these people. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I think these powerful people found out that I was applying for crowdfunding and had decided that, before the crowdfunding funds materialises,  I should be declared a bankrupt so that the can sell off my apartment, my computer (sell to themselves) and my car - the house and car I bought with my pension funds. That is how they are planning to get all my technology for free!<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Please help donate so that I can escape these difficulties. Please pass the word around as my only protection is if the public know how very powerful people are trying to destroy me.</p>

As an engineer I have spent most of my working life developing and inventing new technologies, software, equipment and gadgets.

Inventions to date

1. Car air conditioner electronic control system 
The car air conditioner can consume anywhere between 10% to 30% of the engine power and fuel consumption, depending upon your engine size, make and air conditioner. I had developed an unconventional air conditioner controller that was saving me upto 10% in fuel consumption but never tested on other cars.





2. An Alternative Theory of Economics
It took me the better part of 18 years to develop an alternative theory of economics that was based upon probability theory and wave theory. This theory explained the difference between inflation and hyperinflation, showed the relationship between Demand and Supply and Inflation. Also showed that probability can be greater than 1 or 100% and invented group (or crowd) probability theory. It showed that economies experience oscillations or business cycles and if we could identify these oscillations we could predict stock and commodity trends up to 2 to 3 years into the future. The main equations developed were:-
M(z) = W(z) + I(z) + N(z) ... Market Behaviour
and 
D - S = kI ... the relationship between Demand, Supply and Inflation 
Was awarded a Doctorate in Economics for developing this theory.

Brent Crude Predictions made in December 2012

The prediction charts below show the actual trend, blue line, and the predicted trend, red/maroon/brown line.

Did you notice that I got the turning points, when it turns up and when it turns down, on the trend line almost spot on? The data used is based upon one closing price data per month. On 12th December 2012, when the Brent Crude prices was 
$110, I had published my prediction that Brent Crude price would peak in
 2013 and then drop by 2014. 

I was expecting it to drop down to $73 but 
it dropped further. When I published my charts in December 2012, no one was expecting the 
price to drop, in fact most people thought my predictions were wrong and
 Brent Crude prices would hold at around $110 forever. Amazing. May be I should have done a little more analysis to show how the price would behave into 2015 or 2016. I was 
predicting Brent Crude price trends one and a half years into the 
future. Did I make history? Please check  the 5 year chart at http://www.tradingeconomics.com/commodity/brent-crude-oil which shows that Brent Crude actually hit $118 in February 2013. I got that right!
Palm Oil Price Prediction done in 14th January 2013


You can compare this prediction with the current palm oi prices as shown in http://www.indexmundi.com/commodities/?commodity=palm-oil&months=120. My chart was don in Malaysian Ringgit where as the current data by indexmundi is in US$. The Malaysian Ringgit has fluated during this period from RM3.30 to RM4.4 to the US$. The blue line is the actual trend and the red line is the predicted trend.

Silver Price prediction between June 2011 to September 2011

I predicted, on 19th June 2011, that the price of silver would spike between June 2011 and September 2011. Those who believed my prediction could have made a lot of money. Of course some fund managers got it into their head that their duty was to spend millions to ensure the spike did to occur so the top of the spike was flattened.As you can see from http://www.macrotrends.net/1470/historical-silv... and select the 5 year chart option you will see that the actual silver price peaked in August 2011. The price peaked around $42. My timing was remarkable. Rapeseed Price Prediction in 2009 for trend until 2012
It is truly an amazing price prediction as I had tried to predict the rapeseed price trend up to 3 years ahead. I did the price prediction chart in October 2009, the top chart and came back in 2012 to show the actual price trend which is the lower chart. That is why there are two charts on this image.

Between 2009 and 2010 I was expecting a sideways market - not worth trading in. I expected the rapeseed price to rally after that. The rally came a little earlier than expected. What is amazing is that the prediction trend shows that rapeseed price falls in 2012. That is almost 2 to 3 years ahead I was predicting that the rapeseed prices fall. The price has been falling since 2012 until end of 2014! Please see http://www.indexmundi.com/commodities/?commodity=rapeseed-oil&months=120 for the actual historical price trend.
Soybean Price Trend PredictionI must admit that I may have done this soybean price prediction erroneously and I did not go back to update the prediction. There can be several reasons for this error but I still show this prediction to show you the truth - that it is possible to make errors when generating the  prediction trend charts.The actual price trend is shown in http://www.nasdaq.com/markets/soybean.aspx?timeframe=5y.  For the trained eye there are a lot of similarities but I mistook the overall trend so my prediction does not look similar. I did predict that the soybean price would peak in 2013 which it did, so that part was correct. 

3. A method of making bread without kneading - The Batter and Dough Method
For over thousands of years mankind has made bread with the Straight Dough Method or the Sponge and Dough Method. The Batter and Dough Method is very different way of making bread and is based on allowing gluten formation in batter. This reduces the need for kneading the dough. The recipes and more explanation is provided at http://bachutha.com/how-to-make-homemade-bread-that-does-not-go-stale-9-days/
Use bread flour, instead of plain flour / all purpose flour or strong bread flour, then you will not need to change the amount of water used in the recipe.You will notice, in the video, that I am using Calcium Propionate as an anti-fungal agent. You can leave it out if you do not want any chemicals in your bread. If you do leave it out your bread would last about 4 to 5 days before you may see fungal growth on your bread and need to throw it away even though the bread has not gone stale or dried up.I am freely giving away this method of making bread so that many people can benefit especially the poor who cannot afford a bread making machine and the old who have no strength to knead bread.Try making your own bread at home with bread flour and you will find that even simple bread recipes are simply delicious.If you liked this video and found it helpful please make a donation as research and development takes a lot of time and funds.4. The Bad Bot Exterminator - WordPress website Firewall
The latest development is PHP firewall to protect WordPress sites from hackers and bad web crawlers from attacking and overloading your websites as described below.
There are other inventions, related to rubber technology and computer architecture, that I have not included here.


The Perks and what you get1. Short Stories : Perfect LoveThis
 book, PDF version to be emailed, ""Perfect Love and Other Stories"", was 
written around 1996 / 1997 when I was stuck with some mathematical 
problems. Writing the book was an emotional roller coaster ride and I 
enjoyed every minute of it. My stories are true fiction. They range from soppy mushy romances to 
ghost and horror stories. I even have some science fiction and ghost 
stories.  Some are really funny fiction and others are horrid. Many have
 a moral behind the story … if you can find them. Most are set in 
Malaysia but there are some stories set in Japan, UK (...errrrr...almost 
partially ) and Singapore. Much of my fiction is twisted. You will know 
what I mean when you read the book. By the way, many of the stories are 
of mature content so I don’t think they are suitable for children.I
 tested out my short stories on friends and strangers before deciding 
to publish them hence they clearly have a reasonably high standard of 
narration … at least with respect to the people I tested them on. 
Actually, while I was field testing my short stories I found out that 
the girls tended to cry but the guys tended to laugh at the 
stories. Are my stories so twisted that guys and gals see my stories 
from different points of view?2. Secret Stock Forecasting

 This
 is a 39 page book, PDF version to be emailed, ""My Secret Techniques to 
Forecast the Stock Market"", on some of my 'secret' and original 
techniques to forecasting the stocks and commodity trends. I wrote this 
later after I published my first book, ""Market Theories & Predicting
 the Stock Market by Visual Inspection"". The main idea was to add a 
summary of my techniques and additional simplified methods that I had 
overlooked in the first book. It includes words of advise before you try
 any trading, some of my personal anecdotes and different methods I had 
developed over the years.


3. The Bad Bot Exterminator
This
 is a firewall to protect WordPress websites and the reason for crowd 
funding on this page. Hence it is offered here at a 30% discount. The 
pricing on my website, https://www.dpabadbot.com,
 is $50. It is one of the best protection you can install on your 
WordPress website. This software is licensed and encrypted to protect 
the PHP files / contents from hackers. This product will be emailed as a
 zip file.
WordPress bloggers can download the SuperFast Cache plugin at https://www.dpabadbot.com/wordpress-plugins/super-fast-cache-controller-and-php-accelerator-amazing-web-page-speed.php free of charge. There are other free plugins at my site too.
4. Predicting Stocks, Commodities
This book, softcover to be posted by registered mail, covers my 
research work in economics and is an extension of my doctoral thesis. 
Its a revolutionary different approach to modeling in Economics and uses
 Probability Theory and Wave Theory to explain many economic phenomena. I
 have explained the maths so that non mathematical readers can 
understand the essence of the theories and models and apply them to the 
Visual Inspection Techniques I had developed. The theory goes on to 
explain why stocks and commodities are predictable and how to predict 
them by visual inspection. You can even enter your trend data into Excel
 worksheets and generate the predictions. 
My first public 
prediction, shown below, was done in 1998 during the Asian Financial 
Crisis. That was the year I began publishing my charts.





The 4 month training course


I have not used these theories and models to predict Forex trends. 
It's 
not easy to predict charts if you are a novice at reading trends. You 
will need a lot of practice and patience. The training course includes 
my book ""Market Theories & Predicting the Stock Market by Visual 
Inspection"" and my time 
and labour to answer your questions over the next 4 months after getting
 the book. That would include helping you with your questions and 
helping you predict 2 to 4 charts per 
month. The book explains how to select stocks or commodities 
that are predictable and having understood the methods I had developed, 
shows you how to forecast price trends one or more years into the 
future. You will need to enter the price data into a Excel work sheet 
and massage the data to generate the predictions.
Your Requirements: 

1. You will need to supply the data for the charts you need help with prediction 

2. From a mathematical point of view you need to know what are sine 
and cosine functions. These are school level mathematics, 
trigonometrical functions -sine, cosine tangent to be able to use Visual
 Inspection Methods to predict the markets. Do purchase the 4 month 
training course if you meet the above two requirements.
Some of the contents of the book is shown in the video below.


I have only a limited amount of books, about 50 books, printed for 
this 
training course. After that I doubt I will print anymore books as I need
 to focus on my anti hacking software sales and marketing.

Crowd Funding for The Bad Bot Exterminator for WordPress blogs The Bad Bot Exterminator, with its proprietary engine, has a unique way to identify and block hackers and bad bots from attacking your WordPress websites. It took under three years of development and testing to launch this powerful anti hacking PHP software. It is so good that even DoS (Denial of Service) attacks failed to crash my WordPress website. 
My bread making blog is at http://bachutha.com, and many hackers from Russia, Ukraine, Moldova, France, Germany, USA, Canada, Turkey and China continuously attack my blog every day, every year. As a result, during 2011 to 2013, my web hosting server was overloaded trying to meet the demand for webpages to be viewed by these hackers and the site slowed down considerably. Some days no one could view my website and as a result my visitor count dropped from 1200 per day to 200 per day. Worst still my website pagerank dropped from 4 to 2. So after two years of hacker attacks I decided to do something about it and developed the Bad Bot Exterminator.
Always monitor the activity around your website
Originally, I was monitoring my other website manually by checking the visitor statistics daily.  Actually, you will not know if your website was attacked until you check the historical data.




As you can see from the data above, there was nothing I could do about it but just watch them attack my sites. 
The hosting services provide Awstats and Webalizer for you to monitor the activity on your website. Awstats does removes bot activity from the data so you will never know how many bots are visiting or attacking your site. Webalizer should show you all the data, whether its bot or human activity but it is difficult to manually go through all the data to determine if they were bots or human visitors.
It was for this reason I developed the The Bad Bot Exterminator, a anti hacking software firewall, to block hackers as they came in for the attack. This meant that I did not have to look helplessly at the data after the attacks occurred. 

You will never know how severely your site is under attack

Here was my e-commerce cart under attack. They attacked this site 28 million times in a single day.
The Bad Bot Exterminator defends against DDoS attacks successfully

The table above shows how successfully my website was protected during the DDoS attack that lasted 9 days. That is a very long period of time to be under an attack. The attack was carried out by a large multinational corporation and yet no one noticed the attack. My WordPress website was running as if all was well with the world.Websites are attacked very oftenOur websites are attacked more often then we think as most of us are not monitoring visitor activity of our sites on a regular basis.We never know when our websites will be attacked by hackers. In most cases, based on my experience, about 10% to 30% of our webpages are attacked by hackers looking for weaknesses.

This means your visitors and Google will notice the performance difference. 
Together, they form a caching system for WordPress blogs that is one of the fastest in the world.I urgently need your helpOver the years I have found that 1. I am not allowed to apply for patents in Malaysia. In 1998 / 1999 I applied for a patent but the patent office held back my applications for 7 years, until 2005. This means my patent applications are blocked.
2. In 2011, my house was robbed and my computer was stolen. They took all the backups drives and CD's. There was about 20 years of research work in my computer. This work involved unpublished mathematical models on product pricing and other works.


The police refused to check for fingerprints. In Malaysia everyone, the locals and foreign workers, are issued Identity Cards with their fingerprints stored in the chip and government databases. This means that with the fingerprint, offenders can be identified within seconds. Many of my friends suspected that very powerful people were involved in the theft and that was why the police did not check for fingerprints.
3. In 2015, the bank blocked my debit card from being used to make payments overseas, to Google and my hosting accounts. When I complained to the bank, they froze my account and I could not withdraw any funds from my account. It is frightening what the banks are now doing. I have found missing money and extra money in many banks over the last 7 years and the banks are in denial of this.
4. In January 2016, the Inland Revenue department is now claiming I had earned a huge amount of money between 1992 and 1997 (fictitious figures - this is what powerful people can do behind the scenes) and want to take me to court to declare me a bankrupt. I was broke during this period and worked temporary jobs, like waiter & typist, to fund my research. I have since written a 26 page letter to the Inland Revenue Service.
5. I suspect that my emails are monitored and many times I am blocked from accessing my websites. I had complained to my hosting provider in London and they said that the problem was coming from the Malaysian side.
I blogged about the first two situations at http://drpetersnews.com/problems-problems-and-more-problems.html. I do not know why very powerful people want to destroy my work. I have been under constant attacks, over the last 18 years, by these people. 

I think these powerful people found out that I was applying for crowdfunding and had decided that, before the crowdfunding funds materialises,  I should be declared a bankrupt so that the can sell off my apartment, my computer (sell to themselves) and my car - the house and car I bought with my pension funds. That is how they are planning to get all my technology for free!

Please help donate so that I can escape these difficulties. Please pass the word around as my only protection is if the public know how very powerful people are trying to destroy me.
By the way I am the guy who coined the term ""Real Economy"" back in 1998.
Why I need your support
I have been working on the Bad Bot Exterminator for almost 3 years. Now I need your help to move into marketing and sales of The Bad Bot Exterminator and I really need an expert in internet marketing to join my company. Someone who can join me as a partner or as an employee. Preferably someone who has a proven track record. Furthermore, I have come to the point where I need to hire staff to help me finish off other products in the pipeline, such as a contact form with built in security features and a proxy email server. There is a version of The Bad Bot Exterminator for custom PHP based websites - this version is almost complete just a little more work to be done. I had got this far by doing odd and temporary jobs and help from family. I had an office before but sold of my printing equipment and closed the office due to the difficulty of raising capital and getting partners. If I receive excess funds I would pay off my bank loan, which was 
used to fund my research and rent a new office space, hire programmers and sales staff. Then  I don't have to ever worry about how to 
pay off my loan and I can focus on more technological development and 
sales. That would be a huge burden lifted off my shoulders.Lets make the internet a safer place where anonymous hackers have a very difficult time hacking your websites because of the Bad Bot Exterminator firewall. Lets make it happen.Best regards,Peter AchuthaPS. Please pass the word around about my crowd funding requirements and let your friends know about the perks and benefits.",32.0,3,"1 Campaign

a successful background in traditional advertising in published media. At one point, I realized that there
should be a better way
for businesses to

much brainstorming and months of trial and error designs and drawings, I came up with a concept.</span></p><p><span></span></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FN8bReNKUzQg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DN8bReNKUzQg%26feature%3Dyoutu.be&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FN8bReNKUzQg%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p>It was <span>developed to satisfy a

<p>S<span>quizzy is used in the Australian urban language meaning ‘to have a look’. At the same time it can

global app to help you promote your business for less than $1 a day and helps
people look out for deals/offers on an everyday basis. 
It is
an app not just for businesses, but also for consumers with a business idea.Meet Squizzy App
The Squizzy App is the brain child of Reg Zegers
(I) who comes from
a successful background in traditional advertising in published media. At one point, I realized that there
should be a better way
for businesses to
connect with their customers than the current range of digital online directories and mobile search platforms/apps. With
much brainstorming and months of trial and error designs and drawings, I came up with a concept.
It was developed to satisfy a
customer’s need of having better access to deals and special events that businesses offer. At the same time Squizzy App makes it possible for businesses
to address their
target market in a more direct way by promoting their business and their special offers or events. Besides that Squizzy
App offers its registered users a simple way to
find local businesses in the area by business type, product/service keywords and geo-location or any combination of these.
Introducing Squizzy App
The Squizzy App is a new hybrid directory style mobile application that has some new and unique concepts incorporated to keep users engaged and therefore offer great value for those using the app to promote their business. It gives businesses the opportunity to advertise their services/products cost-effectively
(under a dollar a day) via the application. 
Squizzy App will also
promote the deals that local businesses are offering and special events they are running from their business pages and through push technology directly into the user’s app. It
is a free application where users can
download the app on to their Android
or an iOS supportive smartphone and use the app
even without registration.
However to
take advantage of the various club benefits, have access to deals and events or participate in the unique Jackpot program, users
will need to register with the Squizzy
App directly or through their Facebook
account.Businesses will also be able to register and list all their information free so there will be no barrier for compiling the business directory database quickly. Business will pay a small fee (less than $1 per day) to offer deals or to promote an event through the app and have this deal or event pushed to users in the local area. Deals and events will have duration of up to 1 month and businesses can have up to 5 deals/promotions or events running concurrently. 
Why
the name Squizzy App?
Squizzy is used in the Australian urban language meaning ‘to have a look’. At the same time it can
be associated with quick,
prompt and fast. Squizzy is a term that is fun to pronounce and easy to
remember. Naming the application Squizzy is due to the fact that users can take a
peek at the special offers and
events
of several businesses and
have a look for what is in their interest. The logo also carries the animation of
an eye indicating ‘to have to look’.Squizzy App’s key features

How
does it benefit consumersAre you a one-man or

local audience? If you are someone who provides cleaning or nanny service, take

How
does it benefit businessesSquizzy App is   a   unique   marketing   tool   that   can   be   used   by   businesses   to   promote   their products/services to their target audience. This is a great opportunity for businesses to generate brand exposure and publicize their product/service. Ideally people experience special offers and/or events of a specific business and generate positive word-of-mouth advertising. As the trend of owning a web-enabled smartphone is rising in today’s market scenario, it is important that businesses have to keep track with these trends and hence increase their online presence.Squizzy App is different from other applications as it enables to store and redeem deals.
When users
find or receive specific notifications of a deal or event that they want to use,they can move the voucher for that deal to a wallet type file called ‘My Deals’ so that
they can be easily managed and
redeemed at anytime.
The app will also notify the user if one of
his/her deals in
the ‘My Deals’ section is about to expire.
The Squizzy application allows businesses to
upload up to a maximum of 5 promotions
a day with no lock-in contracts making it extremely flexible for
businesses and they can
also provide special discounts/deals to people who have selected their business
as a ‘favourite’ on the app. Login
Process for Business
Businesses have to register through a registration panel on the Squizzy
App website, which will be a portal the back-end web service accessed by
the app. This set-up process will be an easy step-by-step system and will also lead businesses through the process of establishing their discount structure.
After initial registration, the business will be verified by the Squizzy App Admin and will then be eligible
to create deals and events that will be included on
their business listing and also which
will be broadcast by push notifications out to all
users
of the Squizzy App
in the locality. Further more a
business will enjoy 24x7 back-end service, which means you will be able to access and edit their business and deal information at anytime by logging in to their profile on the Squizzy App’s
website.Pricing
Strategy
The cost of promoting deals, events and special offers for a business will be $29.95 per month. That
means, businesses can promote
their product/service throughout the entire
month for a low monthly charge of
$29.95 or for less than $1 a day. Squizzy
App is the only tool that allows businesses to be promoted on the application for less than $1 dollar a day.

rating an existing business and many many more ways.
What
the Jackpot System is all about
The Jackpot system is exclusive to the Squizzy App and is the
most unique aspect of
the system. It is
a mechanism designed specifically to help incentivize
users to continuously be using the  app by striving to attain then next club level or maintain their
existing club level. By ensuring a high level of continued user engagement, we will be able to increase traffic to the businesses offering deals, events and jackpots and therefore ensure a high
level of business participation because they will have a large and engaged audience and increased
business.Businesses can apply to Squizzy App Admin through the website to offer their products or services as a Jackpot prize to users of the Squizzy App. Businesses can specify which club level they would like to target and their total budget for the prize. The total number of Jackpot prizes can then be determined for the promotion.
Jackpot prizes will be awarded totally randomly and will be straight unconditional prizes. To ensure users
are aware of the current Jackpot prizes on
offer, there will
be ‘advertisements’ about all Jackpots in
the notifications section of the
app.
TimelineHow funds will
be spent

All funds will be spent on the development of the Squizzy App for the iOS and Android platform and other costs surrounding that development.Front and Back-end landing page -  Yes, we are a mobile app and we estimate that the
largest part of users will use our mobile applications more than visiting our
landing page, but we will be developing one to let people know exactly what
they can look out for in the app. The back-end of the landing page deals with
all the servers and requirements to link the website with our applications. 
IOS Application Development - This covers all the costs of iOS development and design.
This also covers debugging the application to ensure that there are as little
amounts of problems with the application as possible. Back-end operations
developer’s salary will also be covered.
Android Application Development - This covers all the costs of Android development and
design. This includes debugging the application for errors so that the amount
of problems that could occur when the application is launched are kept to a
low. Back-end operations developer’s salary will also be covered. 
Marketing
- To gain our audience and encourage them to use the app, we will first need to
market ourselves. This makes it an essential part of our project. It will cover
costs of advertisements, social media promotions and more. 
Administration Costs – This will
cover accounting staff wages and consulting expenses. The
costs for internet, landline and mobile telephone services are also included in
these expenses.
Miscellaneous
Costs – This includes personal costs like
calls made, travel expenses, app maintenance costs and more. 
The greater goal we achieve, the greater
possibilities we have. If we exceed our goal we aim to add more functions and
abilities to our application. Funds
raised above USD $150,000
will be spent on further development and promotion of the Squizzy App.
It will bring us much closer to establishing the App on an international level
targeting more businesses and users worldwide. It will sure help take the app
to a whole new level.  Squizzy App Teaser 1Squizzy App Teaser 2

</div></div>","I went through years of frustration attempting to organize the wiring behind my entertainment center. Lots of products would help one way or another, but it was always expensive, time consuming, lacking flexibility and lacking the option to rearrange or reuse. I wanted simple, easy and control. My solution and Invention...
Ball Tip Clips
PUSH IN   PULL OUT
SIMPLE, EASY, CUSTOMIZABLE 
Each individual Ball Tip Clip holds a single wire. But if you put several together in a strip you gain the spaces between as another clip... 1+1=3!

                      
The Ball Tip Clip Strip... a Powerful Wire Management Tool!



Tough, Versatile...Ball Tip Clips are made of tough resilient nylon in strips of eight, each capable of holding 15 wires or cables. Every Ball Tip Clip has a mounting hole in order to be screw mounted and the design allows for separating clips as needed from the strip by twisting or cutting; flexibility to customize to the needs of your project.    

What I Need & What You Get

I am not asking for a hand out, but I could use a helping hand.
I have product ready to ship with the ability to produce as required. I need sales to help financially, of course. However, what really I need is exposure, help getting the word out about this amazing product! I need all the shout outs you can give me. Share with your friends... like my pages!
What you get if you make a purchase, is a new, innovative piece of American ingenuity that will be a powerful solution for your home & office wire management needs. Keep in mind that Ball Tip Clips make a great gift idea. They are packaged in arrangements and rates discounted for this promotion. You get a great product, made in America, at a fair price, that will fulfill your expectations!
In addition, you get my gratitude for your patronage and the satisfaction of helping out a fellow entrepreneur working hard to create a useful product and business.

The Goal of this Campaign
My starter goal is $35,000. This will use up my existing stock, plus one reproduction and keep me busy in front of this upcoming Holiday season. (Great gift idea... remember!) These proceeds will be used to get me into 2016 with excellent momentum for continued growth to meet my 2016 goals.
Your help will be an incredible and valuable assistance!



Follow up Goals
My goals for 2016 is to work with I.T.  and maintenance departments in large and small businesses to get them to incorporate Ball Tip Clips into their wire management  tool kits. This will be facilitated by small ad campaigns (including much needed new pictures and video). I also want  to include a big campaign for Christmas Light Clips next year and promote my website.
Once again, your help will be an incredible and valuable assistance!

Home & Office
Around every home and office there are wires, cables, cords, usually in unsightly tangles and messes. I would love to tell you that I can make them pretty... I can tell you they can now be easily managed and tamed! Ball Tip Clips are like magic!

Maintenance and I.T. Departments
If you work at a small or a large business, then Ball Tip Clips can help you with all the wire tangles you have. Clean up the mess behind the desk, get the wires off the dusty floor. Computer rooms, break rooms, work benches... anywhere and everywhere you have wires and cables. Your maintenance and I.T. departments will love them!


Customizable and Reusable
Ball Tip Clips are extremely versatile and customizable.They don't lock down the wires, rather they loosely hold and guide the wire. Strong enough to hold oversize wires and still be used with smaller wires if you choose. Also available with two styles of Peel & Stick adhesive tapes; a common foam indoor tape and a powerful Low Temp exterior tape.


Peel & Stick AdhesivesThe common foam tape is on our Home & Office Clip and the Low Temp Clips were designed for attaching to gutters at Christmas, even in freezing temperatures. However, Ball Tip Clips can be used how you want, where you want. I used the low Temp Clips to guide the wires on my TV wall mount. I can move it without worry about the cables. They go along for the ride... in safety!
Push In...Pull OutBest of all, if you need to fix a component, move a cord, add or rearrange, you just pull the wires out and push them back in when you are ready. If you need to move the Ball Tip Clips themselves, obviously if it has an applied adhesive that will be lost. But the Ball Tip Clip still has a mounting hole and can be reused, again and again.

Wire Management made..... Sexy...
Wire management can be boring, a pain, a necessary chore, but with Ball Tip Clips it is now spiced up, maybe fun or even dare I say... SEXY!




Christmas Lights
Hanging Christmas Lights is all about wire management and Ball Tip Clips are a powerful tool for hanging Christmas Lights! Each Ball Tip Clip Strip makes eight Christmas Light hangers that can stretch for 12 linear feet at 18"" intervals. Once attached it is unbelievably easy to put up and take down your Christmas Lights.






But, remember... 1+1=3

Be creative! With Ball Tip Clips you can create totally custom multi string displays! Use two section Ball Tip Clips and hang a set of icicle lights, a string of minis and a string of traditional lights! Your creativity can really be set free...







The Ball Tip Clip Strip... a Powerful Wire Management Tool!


Future GoalsMy future goals include getting Ball Tip Clips into stores where they will be easier to find and purchase for consumers. I already mentioned plans to work with businesses and bulk sales for maintenance and I.T. departments. I also have two additional related products on the drawing board that I hope to introduce by 2017 at the latest. I believe that this little product has a big future! Ball Tip Clips.

<br/><p>About 1 billion alkaline batteries are being thrown away around the world a year and most of them are buried in the ground causing the environment pollution.

<p>We can use the rechargeable battery instead of battery. The rechargeable battery can be used by recharging from 500 times to 1500 times.

Eneroid is an innovative AA battery charger that automatically charges at an extremely quick speed and even stores them after.








































































You can charge AAA rechargeable batteries and use C or D type batteries via charged AAby Eneroid.










About 1 billion alkaline batteries are being thrown away around the world a year and most of them are buried in the ground causing the environment pollution. About 3 million batteries are thrown away every day. The battery that is thrown away after being used only one time causes an economic damage and brings on enormous disaster to the earth.



We can use the rechargeable battery instead of battery. The rechargeable battery can be used by recharging from 500 times to 1500 times. But since we have to charge one by one, it is inconvenient to use. We have to repeat putting the battery in the charger and taking it out again after waiting. We hardly use it because we have to repeat it.

As it is not easy to keep the rechargeable battery after recharging, it is easy to lose the batteries. Since charged ones can be easily mixed with uncharged ones, it is hard to use. Also, the bulk existing charger is not easy to keep because it occupies a wide space.


Eneroid is a epoch-making product that resolved all of these problems. If you put the rechargeable battery on it and press the button one time, it charges and keeps automatically. You just take it out when necessary. 
You can protect the environment
and reduce the cost by Eneroid.











































* Delivery of rewartds/perks is subject to best efforts and not guaranteed.

<p>Hosting control panels haven’t changed much in the last two decades. After years of remaining stagnant, it’s time to bring some fresh blood to the game.</p>
<h2>Awkward...</h2>
<p>The current contenters, cPanel and Plesk, have a plethora of shortcomings (beyond usability).</p>
<h4>Minimum Requirements</h4>
<p>cPanel and Plesk have minimum disk space requirements of 20GB and 10GB respectively. Much of this is eaten up in the excessive graphics which hamper performance and proprietary backend software. A more modern, streamlined approach can negate this issue.</p>
<h4>Extensibility</h4>
<p>While both panels support plugins, they are rudimentary at best and provide minimal documentation. Building on the proven (and extensible) WordPress codebase allows us to offer an unprecedented level of flexibility in a language that many developers are already familiar with.</p>
<h4>Sustainability</h4>
<p>In the hosting world, security and continuing development are crucial. Other control panels require a significant amount of work to keep up to date with the latest issues. Through leveraging the WordPress codebase, we are decreasing our development effort.</p>
<h4>Brandability</h4>
<p>Neither of the major contenders for top control panel was built with rebranding in mind. Overly-complicated template systems make the process time-consuming and expensive. HostPress is being built to be rebrandable by design. In fact, reworking the interface can be easily done with only a few lines of code!</p>
<h2>So Who am I?</h2>
<p>I am an independent software developer with a focus on WordPress application development. Throughout the years I have been a Core Developer for Arch Linux and Easy Digital Downloads and the co-founder of Redux Framework. I am an active member of the WordPress community as a speaker for the local user group and head organizer for WordCamp Omaha and have released over thirty public plugins.</p>
<h2>And What is HostPress?</h2>
<p>Simply put, HostPress is the future of web hosting control panels.</p>
<h4>Extensible</h4>
<p>With HostPress, there is no need to rely on a specific language to write your own plugins. Between native extensibility, a fullscale API, and direct command-line access, you have the power to write plugins as you see fit! Beyond the ability to write your own plugins, at release we will have a robust archive of plugins available to the public covering the most popular server software.</p>
<h4>Beautiful</h4>
<p>A clean, streamlined design makes using HostPress a breeze. No graphics to slow you down and no bulky UI elements to cause screen resolution-dependency issues. From mobile devices through retina displays, icon fonts and clean lines make HostPress beautiful and functional no matter how you use it!</p>
<h4>Powerful</h4>
<p>WordPress powers a quarter of the Internet! By building on one of the most widely-used platforms in use today, we are working with proven code. Beyond the well-known scalability and flexibility of the WordPress core, it is the software behind some major players on the Internet. If it’s good enough for companies like Sony and Samsung, it’s good enough for us!</p>
<h2>Some Stats...</h2>
<p>Here's a few numbers on the market today...</p>
<h4>Individual Users</h4>
<p>There are 4,101,891 individual servers running active, licensed cPanel and Plesk installations (according to BuiltWith).</p>
<h4>Product Value</h4>
<p>That’s $82,037,820.00 per month spent on control panels (assuming a $20 per month price tag… cPanel runs $45 per month for dedicated servers). And that doesn’t include the money spent on support and plugins!</p>
<h4>User Base</h4>
<p>While nobody knows the exact number of websites online at any given time, Internet Live Stats has estimated that as of September, 2014, the Internet has surpassed one billion websites… with nearly a million being created daily!</p>
<h2>What I Need</h2>
<p>While I am a WordPress developer, I'm not a network architect. I can write the majority of what makes HostPress awesome by myself (and I'd LOVE to be able to make this a labor of love), but I need to hire a server guru to make this a reality. As such, I'm hoping to raise $175,000 to support myself and my son, and cover the server fees and salary of a server guru for one year.</p>
<h2>What You Get</h2>
<p>If funded, the goal is to release a beta version in June 2016 with the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>A modern, open-source, extensible server control panel</li>
<li>An intuitive (and responsive) interface</li>
<li>A fully-localized platform (HostPress speaks your language!)</li>
<li>A platform developers can build on, including the ability to simply rebrand the panel without complex template languages.</li>
</ul>
<p>Following the initial beta, we will spend another six months fixing the inevitable bugs (patches are welcome!), responding to user feedback, and working to provide translations for languages other than English before the first stable version is released.</p>
<p>If we are not fully funded, the project will go on... but at a slower pace. Putting food on the table and paying bills is too important to give up completely, to say nothing of the expenses inherent in hiring a server guru!</p>
<h2>The HostPress Impact</h2>
<p>At the very least, this project will result in a very cool piece of open-source technology being released. That said, our goal is to provide the Internet with an alternative to the clutter and complexity of server management. Even if we don't become a major contender in this space, the support we do get will put pressure on the existing solutions to up their game. Basically... catch up with the times, or die.</p>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>Even if you can't help us financially, there's still plenty you can do! Share this campaign with your friends and colleagues. If you're bilingual, familiarize yourself with <a href=""https://www.transifex.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Transifex</a> so you can help translate the beta.</p><p>

<p>User management, a very primitive domain manager, and the file manager work to at least some extent. Extensions connects to our (currently empty) extension database and Support is currently just a simple email form that opens a support ticket (eventually, it will be fully integrated and have a built-in FAQ/tutorial section).

<p>The idea in the first place was to have a device that you can plug between your computer and your modem/router, and everything behind that device will be encrypted. Upcoming data retention laws and the ever increasing mass surveillance call eagerly for solutions. The Enigmabox enables people with no technical backgrounds to protect themselves from spying - by just plugging in a cable.</p>
<h3>Just a Plug &amp; Play VPN Device?</h3>
<p>Encrypt everything you do online is one part. ""Making phone calls and sending emails inside this encrypted network should also be possible."" ""Using a central telephony and email server? I'm not a fan of that, and it doesn't scale."" In fact, it didn't scale. And then, we discovered Cjdns. This piece of software provides public key networking, end-to-end encryption for every packet, and is designed specifically for mesh networks.</p>
<p>But there is more.</p>
<p>The IP address is the cryptographic hash, which is your authentication. There is no need for a central authentication server. We can build our telephony system distributed. And in fact, we have! Every Enigmabox runs a telephony server and an email server. They are communicating encrypted, using their IPv6 as authentication, backed by a private key. It works!</p>
<h3>So what IS the Enigmabox?</h3>
<p>The Enigmabox is a networking device that encrypts your Internet traffic - comparable to a VPN, but implemented as a hardware appliance. Plus, you can make secure phone calls and exchange encrypted emails with other Enigmabox users. Also the default firewall configuration protects your computer or network from outside access.</p>
<h2>Why Indiegogo?</h2>
<p>Thus far, not many people know about the Enigmabox. Your support will help us move out of our garage into full production. We hope to get the Enigmabox into as many hands as possible. If our campaign does not get funded, it’s back to the garage, making them a few at a time when we can. We thank you for your pledge, in any amount. This is a cause we believe in very much and hope others see value in. High five!</p>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>The Enigmabox has been protecting people from all walks of life - journalists, lawyers, dentists, families, local councils, enterpreneurs. It actually works and has proven to withstand surveillance for over 1.5 years now. We currently have 500 active users. But we need more to make a real difference in the world.</p>
<p>Our goal is to make cryptography accessible for everyone, and thus lay in your hands an effective tool for protection against tyranny and oppressive states. Help us spreading the word!</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Technology &amp; Security</h2><div><br/></div><div>
<p></p>
<h3>100% Open Source, 100% Control</h3>
<p>Last year, we ported every piece of software neccessary to run the Enigmabox to OpenWRT. Every user has root access on his Enigmabox via SSH. This is your device, you are in control over your data. Servers only move encrypted data around and store nothing - no emails, no phone calls, no address book. This is all stored locally on your Enigmabox. And since every network packet is encrypted, servers don't even know if the data they transmit is a phone call, an email or an image from the Internet.</p>

</div></div>","Our Story
The idea in the first place was to have a device that you can plug between your computer and your modem/router, and everything behind that device will be encrypted. Upcoming data retention laws and the ever increasing mass surveillance call eagerly for solutions. The Enigmabox enables people with no technical backgrounds to protect themselves from spying - by just plugging in a cable.
Just a Plug & Play VPN Device?
Encrypt everything you do online is one part. ""Making phone calls and sending emails inside this encrypted network should also be possible."" ""Using a central telephony and email server? I'm not a fan of that, and it doesn't scale."" In fact, it didn't scale. And then, we discovered Cjdns. This piece of software provides public key networking, end-to-end encryption for every packet, and is designed specifically for mesh networks.
But there is more.
The IP address is the cryptographic hash, which is your authentication. There is no need for a central authentication server. We can build our telephony system distributed. And in fact, we have! Every Enigmabox runs a telephony server and an email server. They are communicating encrypted, using their IPv6 as authentication, backed by a private key. It works!
So what IS the Enigmabox?
The Enigmabox is a networking device that encrypts your Internet traffic - comparable to a VPN, but implemented as a hardware appliance. Plus, you can make secure phone calls and exchange encrypted emails with other Enigmabox users. Also the default firewall configuration protects your computer or network from outside access.
Why Indiegogo?
Thus far, not many people know about the Enigmabox. Your support will help us move out of our garage into full production. We hope to get the Enigmabox into as many hands as possible. If our campaign does not get funded, it’s back to the garage, making them a few at a time when we can. We thank you for your pledge, in any amount. This is a cause we believe in very much and hope others see value in. High five!
The Impact
The Enigmabox has been protecting people from all walks of life - journalists, lawyers, dentists, families, local councils, enterpreneurs. It actually works and has proven to withstand surveillance for over 1.5 years now. We currently have 500 active users. But we need more to make a real difference in the world.
Our goal is to make cryptography accessible for everyone, and thus lay in your hands an effective tool for protection against tyranny and oppressive states. Help us spreading the word!

Technology & Security

100% Open Source, 100% Control
Last year, we ported every piece of software neccessary to run the Enigmabox to OpenWRT. Every user has root access on his Enigmabox via SSH. This is your device, you are in control over your data. Servers only move encrypted data around and store nothing - no emails, no phone calls, no address book. This is all stored locally on your Enigmabox. And since every network packet is encrypted, servers don't even know if the data they transmit is a phone call, an email or an image from the Internet.
Have a look at the source code on GitHub: https://github.com/enigmagroup/enigmabox-openwrt


Secure your Internet connection
Wherever you are, you always get the ""trusted"" Internet from the Enigmabox servers, bypassing law enforcement agencies, snooping secret services or evil dudes who have targeted your PC and try to put some malware on it.

provides nonprofits and charities with a fully branded fundraising app at ZERO upfront

With a

We know
that every dollar helps keep the lights on, staff paid, supplies purchased and
programs funded. Most nonprofits aren’t able to allocate funds to dive into the
mobile technology world and interact with over 207 million smartphone users. 
That’s
where we come in. The power of the micro-donation.  

While
most nonprofits are spending energy going after large scale donations, they’re
missing out on a huge revenue stream through micro-donations, which are – you
guessed it – small donations (think businesses collecting spare change at registers).

The
amazing thing about micro-philanthropy is that these small amounts add up to
BIG DOLLARS over time. Our belief is that through its own custom app,
nonprofits will be able to rely on small, but consistent income through the
coupon-based donations offered through GiveRight’s app.

Win-win for donors and nonprofits

About our team:
Cynthia Hammersley - Managing Partner & Co-founder
As you approach the bottom of the 8th inning of your career, you spend more time looking for ways to give back to those who come behind you.  It is my wish to take the skills and knowledge gained over more than 35 years in the technology business to find a way to help those in need at a rate far greater than I could by just writing a check.  GiveRight was founded on the concept of, ""give a person a fish, they eat for a day, teach a person to fish, they eat for a lifetime.""  By pulling together an end to end solution to address the problems most charities face in engaging people in their cause and funding the good works they do, we hope to give charities the tools to turbo charge the good they can do in our communities. I hope you will join me in this quest by helping us fund this campaign.
Curtis Gruninger - Co-founder 
GiveRight grew out of a lifelong charity mindset instilled in me by my parents. This mindset combined with my 28 years of experience in the technology sector was the driving force behind what you see today. As a second generation Eagle Scout, community focus and charitable giving has always been of paramount importance to me. Along with my GiveRight partnership team we have over 100 years of combined experience in start-up, small, medium and Fortune 500 business. We see GiveRight as our legacy, our gift back to the community after successful careers and happy lives.
THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU!  Without your support and faith in our mission it would take us much longer to get our solution finished and that would delay our ability to help 100's or 1,000's of non-profits ""do more good"".  
All of us at GiveRight wish you and your family much happiness, prosperity and good health as 2016 unfolds.

<p></p>
<p>ORIGIGRIP is an affordable, dexterous robot gripper/hand/end effector
 for hobby &amp; research robotics projects.  It is made from just a few 3D 
printed parts: simple yet robust!  It is driven by a standard (high 
torque) hobby servo yet can handle an incredible variety of objects. 
 It can open to 225 mm (almost 9"") and has 2 ""fingers"", each with 2 
articulating segments giving the ORIGIGRIP a firm hold on almost 
anything.  Rubberized finger padding provides extra grip and helps to cushion the object being 
grasped.</p>You can add wrist 
rotation by mounting ORIGIGRIP to a standard servo via the included 
mounting horn at the back (Available as a separate perk).<br/><br/>
<p>Here's just a sample of what the ORIGIGRIP can hold:<br/></p>

<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>The ORIGIGRIP opens and closes quickly and fluidly.  When its ""fingers"" come in contact with and object, they begin to enclose it, conforming to its shape to get a great grip!<br/><br/>

<br/><div>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Design:</h3>
<p>ORIGIGRIP was designed from the ground up to be extremely versatile, lightweight, strong, and affordable.  Its design is that of an ""under-actuated"" gripper, where just one actuator can manipulate multiple degrees of freedom.  This means your robot can grip almost anything while being driven by a single control signal (Open / Close).  The ""fingers"" are driven using artificial tendons made of durable mono-filament line.  The lower (proximal) segments will begin to close first, until an object interrupts their path, then the further (distill) segments will continue to close until the object is fully grasped.  The gripper opens in a similar fashion until it reaches the completely open position. <br/><br/></p>

<p>At AusThai we have come up with a fun project for the festive season. It’s a soldering kit that will take about an hour for a beginner to build (less if you’re an experienced solderer). It’s designed to plug into a Raspberry Pi or an Arduino. It will take a few minutes to program the Raspberry Pi or Arduino and then the project is ready to show to your friends.</p>
<p>There are three LEDs that can be controlled in whatever sequence you program. There is a small music chip with piezo speaker that will play Jingle Bells when you send it a ‘start’ signal. Then there is a photo-sensor to detect when you pass your hand overhead. </p>

<p><u><strong>Who is the team?</strong></u></p>
<p><br/>EAK Design is a group of forward thinking industrial designers who came together in San Francisco, CA to use their combined talents and bring innovative solutions, style and purpose to a market saturated with cheap knockoffs and identical products. After identifying this sad trend of cheap imitation and half-measures in the tech industry, we aim to never cut corners and use research insights and modern craft to bring innovation and excellent user experience to our customers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The campaign:</strong></p>
<p><br/>This campaign is an effort to bring great products to the market and establish a global brand that will help more industries benefit from the industrial design process. Through careful research and 3D prototyping we have been able to design products that are ergonomic and purposeful. Beauty and function incarnate. Our goal is to use this same approach to bring stylish products to every aspect of your life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Enjoy the benefits of better design:</strong></p>
<p><br/>By helping us spread the idea of innovation with style, contributors will benefit from an influx of products that have been thoughtfully, sustainably and smartly realized. EAK’s vision is to become a leader in innovation and technology by providing the premium quality tools you need to succeed in your busy life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How your support will help us:</strong></p>
<p><br/>We are ready for production and just need your support to start shipping out the N1 and N2 power banks. As soon as the funds are released we will pay our manufacturing partners and mail out the power banks. This will also help fund research and design for the next phases of our power banks and further products. Our approach ensures that we are connecting with our customers and constantly improving our offerings based on real user feedback.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The challenges that we face:</strong></p>
<p><br/>While there are many other power banks in the market, many of them virtually identical, we wanted to make an impact by redefining a product category. It will be challenging to compete for attention among so many different products but our studio’s unique vision and core beliefs keep us marching steadily towards our goals. When you support us, you are supporting a whole new generation of industrial designers and creatives who give their lives to bring beautiful and meaningful objects into your daily life. As industrial design spreads through industries, we can expect to see a rise in sustainable, durable, stylish and useful products in every facet of life.</p>
<p>We are working tirelessly to promote and drive traffic to our Indiegogo page through Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and other digital advertising.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>We need your support!</strong></p>
<p><br/>It may be challenging to enter a saturated market, but it is in our nature to face challenges head on and ask for help when needed. We have the connections and expertise but cannot complete this project alone. We need your support to spread the word. By sharing this project through Indiegogo and social media you are helping us usher in a new type of market. A market where the customers come first and enjoy the benefits of thoughtful and beautiful products.

Partnering with local retailers, BeerDropper (which doesn't sell or deliver alcohol itself), acts as a middle man and marketing channel for retailers to reach their customers. BeerDropper is uniquely suited for this market due to its patented ID validation and data management technology that can help make on-demand delivery more safe, secure, convenient, and efficient. After proof of concept in this industry, we plan to expand to adjacent markets including pharmaceuticals, healthcare, banking, government, education, entertainment, and transportation. </p>

Partnering with local retailers, BeerDropper (which doesn't sell or deliver alcohol itself), acts as a middle man and marketing channel for retailers to reach their customers. BeerDropper is uniquely suited for this market due to its patented ID validation and data management technology that can help make on-demand delivery more safe, secure, convenient, and efficient. After proof of concept in this industry, we plan to expand to adjacent markets including pharmaceuticals, healthcare, banking, government, education, entertainment, and transportation. 

For Consumers

We offer convenience of ordering from home, saving time and effort
Delivery means potentially avoiding driving while intoxicated. 
Our prices are the same as they find in-store, only a small delivery fee is charged.






For Retail Partners


Our patented ID validation technology reduces risk by making it easy and simple to check for fake IDs (18% of college students surveyed report using a fake ID to obtain alcohol), possibly lowering insurance rates.


We open up a whole new channel (internet-based sales) for them to reach their customers

We increase their marketing presence by acting as their internet marketing department.
We help increase sales by partnering with alcohol manufacturers to provide them with exclusive deals and promotional giveaways.








The Solution

Safe and secure ID validation and data management app (iPhones, Androids)
Mobile web apps for the consumer, retailer, and deliverer 
State-of-the-art and proven ID scanning software (no hardware, just camera)

Convenience and efficiency - delivery to your door, saving you time

Patent: http://www.google.com/patents/US20130112746
Patent: http://www.google.com/patents/US20150186962 

LAUNCH: Spring 2016!




The Market Size

According to the US Census report, there are about to 16 million students enrolled in colleges across the United States (US).

The top 10 percent of American drinkers - 24 million adults over the age of 18 consume, on average, 74 alcoholic drinks per week. That works out to a little more than four-and-a-half 750 ml bottles of Jack Daniels, 18 bottles of wine, or three 24-can cases of beer. In one week. (Citation: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/201...)

The average beer, wine, or liquor store generates $400,000 in sales. 








The Revenue Streams

Technology and Marketing Licensing Fee (from Retail Partners)
Delivery fee per order (from Consumers)
Advertising revenue potential - exclusive 21+ real estate
Big Data


The Funding

Operational costs (domain, hosting, continuous improvement, maintenance)
Pre-launch marketing (creating awareness, social media, email, guerilla)
Sales / support

The Differentiators

Operating in the mostly un-tapped college town and residential markets
Patented and novel technology 
Second patent ID Validation and Data Management System issued by the USPTO on March 15, 2016
Approval from Alcohol Beverage Commissions / State Liquor Authorities
Consumer, Retailer, and Driver App - enabling unique delivery platform
Target market - college markets (residential) followed by cities
Co-branding with retailers allowing both businesses to spread their names
Big data analytics valuable to manufacturers, distributors, and retailers
The Impact

Security: reduce fraudulent usage of fake ID's and underage distribution
Eco-friendly: paperless processing, recyclable bags, efficient gas emissions 



The People
BeerDropper has a

How we see monimoto in action






Step by step explanation how monimoto works.
1. Placed monimoto anywhere under plastic covers.

Don't put it inside metal cabinets and boxes, as it blocks radio signals. 
2. You will configure monimoto using Android or iOS app or using geeky SMS syntax (in case you hate smartphones and apps).3. One of the most important concepts in monimoto is about KEYS. There are two types of keys: smart key in your smartphone and master key in a key fob. 


They both operate using Bluetooth low-energy technology.

<p>A simple talk with friends about the future of technology spawned the innovative dreams of Bolong-Kanta Kejera.</p>
<p>Kejera has made great strides from his humble origins, as he has single-handedly begun development on an augmented reality computer headset, Genzo.</p>
<p>Kejera has been tinkering, and working with computer hardware and software from a very young age.</p>
<p>At first glance Genzo might seem similar to other devices that are currently making headlines such as Google Glass, or Oculus Rift. However, what separates Kejera’s invention from the pack is the fact that it is a fully operational computer; this machine is usable in the same capacity as a home PC and far more affordable than Microsoft's alternative.</p>
<p>“There is nothing you can’t do on Genzo.” Kejera states, “I have programmed on it. I have gamed on it. I have watched movies on it.”</p>
<p>Kejera explained that he created the device with the intention of making it user friendly and developer handy. “I want it to be open-source, and I want developers to have an environment where they can feel free to create,” he said.</p>
<p>Genzo’s portability is made possible by using the recently developed Raspberry Pi single-board computer, which is only slightly larger than a credit card.</p>
<p>Kejera has invested a lot of his personal time in the project, and over 2000 dollars have currently been spent on the development of Genzo. He has worked tirelessly, and has no intentions of slowing down in the near future.</p>
<p>In the original conversation that gave birth to Genzo, Kejera and his friends talked about how much they would love to have a gaming system they could wear with the ability to operate off of neural signals that were sent from the brain, to treat a truly immersive experience.</p>
<p>The project has taken a very different form since that initial conversation, scrapping some of the neuro-sensors, and expanding its potential beyond simply gaming, however many of the core ideas that Kejera and his friends shared have remained in the final product to this day.</p>
<p>“Genzo is a revolutionary product, and it revolutionizes the human to computer interface,” Kejera said. “Computers should be built around us, rather than us building our lives around computers.”</p>
<p><strong>Why is it important we get funded?</strong></p>
<p>Genzo is a unique consumer product that has never been on the market. It incorporates mixed reality with on the go computing power. It is a mobile device that gives you access to the internet (via a hotspot), videogames, movies, music,downloads all in a holographic experience that is affordable and convenient to all consumers. It is vital that Genzo is funded because it caters to a segment of the market that has been anticipating a successful AR/VR personal computer for 2 decades. The possibilities are endless.</p>

My partner is a Tool Maker/Product Design Specialist. We are both Marine Corps Veterans. Our drive to make The Pocket Shelf a success is relentless. The Pocket Shelf has two Patents applied for!12/8/16 UPDATE! This is a picture of the FIRST PRODUCTION  POCKET SHELF!  Texturing and verbiage need to be added, on schedule to arrive by 12/16/16! UPDATE!!! WE HAVE ORDERED THE PRODUCTION MOLDS ON 11/1/2016, WE EXPECT TO HAVE THE FIRST SHIPMENT BY THE SECOND WEEK OF DECEMBER!The Pocket Shelf solves the most common household problems. Holes in your walls, phones and drinks on the floor and the need for a safe, clean place to put your phone or drink, INDOORS or OUT!We've all had a drink knocked over on the floor, had nowhere safe to set our phone or needed a shelf where one isn't practical. Until now!The Pocket Shelf  isn't just for drinks and phones either! Check out just some of the ways to use it! Inside or outside, The Pocket Shelf- support when and where you need it!       The uses are endless, the potential markets are enormous! The Pocket Shelf is a must have for the home, office, workshop, traveling, college dorms or Military personnel living in housing, barracks or deployed. Use your imagination!                The market research that we have done has gone EXTREMELY well. The Pocket Shelf was explained, demonstrated and followed by a 10 question survey. Survey questions covered visual appeal, usefulness and potential to purchase. All questions received approximately 80% top 1 and 2 responses. Groups focused on were general public (Mall shoppers), Military, college dorm students and travelers.Market research setup!                    I was asked to present at 1 Million Cups of Syracuse, the response was again, incredible.http://www.1millioncups.com/syracusehttp://www.saltmaker.orgWe have partnered with a local product development company and have been able to reduce the initial cost significantly. Our goal is $19,000, that will fund our initial mold, product run and the staples to be included with each shelf.
We have a CUSTOMIZABLE Perk!     

Your custom photos, Logos or Art can showcase the face of the shelf with our virtually indestructible and CHANGEABLE custom option!
Starting at the $55. level!
 Our biggest challenge is running a successful Flex funding campaign.     We understand the concern of pledging to a Flex campaign, and they are absolutely valid. Scams and dishonest thieves have stigmatized it. Our integrity is VERY important to us, we still believe in the handshake that actually means something. Aside from that, if I were to run some scam, it would VERY likely END MY CAREER as a professional Firefighter. I am an Officer in my department and that stuff is not tolerated in any way. My partner has a long, distinguished and honorable Military service career in which he built his reputation upon honor, trust, and integrity. He is now trusted with his companies trade and business secrets while developing, testing and refining new products.   We will run a very open, honest, transparent campaign. I can promise you, that I, will keep you up to date on everything that happens, as it happens. There are several ways to pledge to this campaign and all have safeguards for slimeballs.                  Campaigns that are very successful usually have a promotion company that has done all of the work for them. We looked into it, and for our $19K goal, the upfront was $5000, over 25% of our goal. That would force us to increase our goal which we are not willing to do. There also are no guarantees on goal achievement, fall short, $5K is still gone. YOU are the only way that we will achieve the goal, PLEASE share, share, share on all of your Social Media sites!Follow, Like and Share Us!https://www.facebook.com/thepocketshelf/https://twitter.com/ThePocketShelfhttps://www.instagram.com/thepocketshelf/https://www.pinterest.com/thepocketshelf/www.thepocketshelf.comWhere will my money go?All money raised here will go to support the initial costs of making the mold, production, packaging, inserts, strips and that is it. All business associated costs will be funded by me. If we go over the set goal? HOORRAAYYYYY!!! Still- ALL raised money will go to the business for more product or whatever may be needed. And again, I will keep you in the loop. No monies will be used for salaries or to pay back the over 10K that we have already invested in this, EVERY PENNY GOES BACK INTO THE BUSINESS, until everything is paid for and future needs such as marketing are met. We don't need a salary at this point, our goal is to bring this product, from my mind to market! YOU can be a BIG part of that!
Why don't you just get a loan or an investor?
Investors- I am asked this all the time... Why don't you go on ""Shark Tank""? The fact is, it's not ready for that. I need to PROVE the market first. My market research ran about 80% top two replies to 10 questions. People LOVE it. Our goal is to get this off the ground first with our small team, THEN, we will seek strategic partners/ investors. They will have to be both. The initial run cost isn't so high, that we are willing to give up a huge chunk of our business because it is unproven.  Loans- I am preapproved for a loan to cover the entire cost. However, that comes with interest. We would much rather keep my costs as low as possible, passing that along , to you, by offering The Pocket Shelf as a Pre-Sale. *IF* there is a shortfall, I have it covered.We have assembled a first class team to make the process and production seamless and fulfillment as smooth as possible. With that said, there are always unforeseen obstacles that come up, no matter how well planned out your process is. Our team is very well capable of handling any issues that may arise in a very timely manner.

The balance sensor and the direction sensor adjust the position of device with the air outlet and the rear side of the device is returned to facing down. It slows the device by giving compressed air from the four output just before the fall. There are pipes that transmits the air to the end and there is a tank involves the compressed air in the case. In this way, the device does not fall to the ground harshly.<br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>Why?</h3> <p></p>
<p>Smart phones and tablet computers are devices that make your life easy. The shapes and sizes of these devices vary depending upon the technology development. Increasingly, they get thinner and have more fragile structure. Therefore, protection products have been a branch of this market. These protection products which have been produced in various shapes and properties have become increasingly more expensive and unpractical. You can use smartphone gelatin to protect your screen. Because this product is made of nylon, it can never fully protect the screen. Except for minor scratches, it is defenseless to falls, impacts and hard metal contacts. It reduces the image quality on the screen, makes bubbles and when it should be removed leaves an adhesive layer. Tempered glass, which is relatively more useful is a hard material with a thick structure. Though it is partially resistant to impacts, it does not provide complete protection. When it is broken it must be changed and is too expensive. In each breaking new fracture should be taken and it changes and breaks 4 times a year on average in the use. In this case, with a simple calculation a 30$ tempered glass means 120$ extra expense per year. It also has a negative impact on touchscreen sensitivity and image.</p>
<p>Apart from the screen you need to use protection case for the device as an extra. In this case a 40$ case need arises. As the levels of protection rise your device which is 7 mm will be 19 mm with case in average. For maximum protection, you will need 1 cm cover. In this case, you will have lost one of the most important features of the device you select for the thinness and portability. Another disadvantage of course is the increase of weight. A 499$ device would be 659 dollars with extra 160 dollars as an additional device for protection and this is just a one-time use. Screen savers will cost 120$ more in each break. At this rate, during the warranty period, the 499$ device will cost 779$.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>What is the solution when there is so much trouble?</h3> <p>Futhark AirCase is the best solution...</p>
<p></p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Futhark AirCase is purchased only once and you can use it as long as you continue to use your device. The product price is only 29$. This is much cheaper compared to a tempered glass and case price. No need for additional protection on the screen because it is only in the form of case cover. Your device will never fall on the screen. Because the case is only 2.2 mm, it does not lose its thickness. While sensors are working, it will give direction to your device during the fall and it will always turn on the rear facing downwards. When there will be 6 cm left from the surface all outputs will slow down with air by working. There will not be problems such as scratches, refraction, the removal of paint on your device.</p>
<p>We trust our product, so we put a counter and the sensor monitoring system on it. Thus, while your device fall we will record this and if we determine that the device is damaged with Futhark AirCase we will meet all costs. No, not a limited warranty. As we have said there is no utilization limit. Just make sure the air is full.</p>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>What if the device falls into the water?</h3> <p>Then the airbag is activated to keep the device on the surface. When it is in the air, the rear side of the device will return against the water and protect the screen again. Don't panic, all entries of the device will be protected from water.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Where is the idea come from?</h3>
<div>
<p>We are 4 university student. Smart phones and tablets are a big part of our lives and naturally we use them every day and every night. Small accidents are inevitable, of course. We started to think how we can get rid of continuous deterioration of the devices we fall, repairing costs we use for protection and ongoing expenses. Finally, an idea takes place while at the beginning it was a joke. We have explored the idea of AirCase. We have made a long research with an engineer friend and we have achieved a prototype. Then by going into mass production we productized it. This product is no longer a protection used only around friends. You can also have through the Indiegogo. Do not forget to write your device model if you order the product.</p>
<p>Two more innovative products are coming soon. We will make a special perk for the ones benefit from this campaign. Stay tuned ...</p>

<h3>The Oboe Reed Log</h3>
<p>My name is Jeff Padgett, I am professional oboist in Chicago.  As any oboist knows, making good reeds is one of the greatest challenges of playing the instrument, and I am trying to do whatever it takes to help make this process easier and more efficient.  I want to bring reed making into the 21st century... we have been making reeds in the Dark Ages for far too long! <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504539559/hv0lpmb4omyzuizrmeuc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>It is vital to limit the variables in reed making, but it is incredibly easy to forget why that great reed in your reed box is as good as it is.  This app will track every aspect of your reeds, so that you can figure out what IS working for your reeds, and what IS NOT.  </p>
<p>Are you in a reed slump?  Now you can go back and look at the specifics for that great reed you had 2 months ago, and see what you are doing differently.</p>
<p>Thinking of making a change to your reed making?  You can track that change in your log, rate your reeds, and see whether they are overall better reeds than what you were making before.  </p>
<p>This app will also allow oboists to SHARE their work with others!  If you are a teacher, you can allow your students to see your reed log (including pictures) so they have models to use in their own reed making.  If you are a student, you can share your Reed Log with your teacher or other students or oboists, comparing notes and diagnosing problems.  </p>
<p>I am mastering Java and learning to program this myself, because I think this app is best coming from an oboist who knows the struggles.  I'm really enjoying learning how to code, and am currently working on the Android version of this app.  When it is near completion, I also plan to make an iPhone version of the app for distribution.</p>

<p>Eventually, i want to make this application available across the globe in various translations.  This campaign is for the Android version of Oboe Reed Log.  Coding this application takes quite a lot of time, and is impossible to do without support.  Please consider becoming a sponsor and bring reed making into the future!  </p>

It's not just you, we all have that problem. That's why we designed this TESSAN Charging Station, to make your charging simple again.DESK ORGANIZERThanks to the detachable phone holder, you can neatly store and charge all your devices at the same time. No more tangled wires, no more additional adapters. You can always keep your desktop clean and tidy!USB-C CHARGING STATION  There are 4 USB charging ports that can automatically identify your devices and charge at an optimal speed. The USB-C charging port charges up to 3A, which largely shorten the charging time.SURGE PROTECTOREvery year, thousands of fires result from power strips and electrical cords. But it doesn’t have to happen, at least not with this charging station. The secret is that it has a surge protector that can take a 510-joule hit, providing maximum protection of all your sensitive electronic devices during storms and power outages.The switch you see is more than a control button, it’s an integrated circuit breaker. when you plug too many high-power appliances that exceed the rated power, the circuit breaker will open up, cutting off any more current flow, saving it from catching fire. It can also reset to normal position automatically.BEAUTIFUL & DURABLEWith all these fancy electronic devices around, there is no reason to get a cheap-looking charging station on your desk. The TESSAN Charging Station has a matte finish for a smooth, silky surface that you can't resist touching! It won’t show pencil marks or fingerprints and will still seem like new even after long-term use.For those who are sensitive to light while in sleep, you can’t go wrong picking this charging station. Unlike conventional power strips with a big red indicator, this one has a tiny white LED that lets you know the power is active but not so bright that lights up the room at night, just enough to let you know it’s there.DESK OR WALL? IT’S UP TO YOU.Equipped with 2 mounting holes and compact flat plug, you can easily hang it on walls, baseboards, or furniture to use as a wall adapter.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Hi, my name is Ali. I am the inventor of the DASHMO. I have experienced past nine years in engineering and programming. Outside of my daily work, I am an entrepreneur. I love inventing. It is almost 14 years that I am developing new products. It was for me an amazing experience and learning curve. When I see a problem, I like to look for the best solution possible. Early this year I established a new company called DMA Innovation. I intend to bring these products to the market through this company. For this, I am working with three other companies for production, fulfillment, and distribution. I hope to fund my first product DASHMO through this INDIEGOGO campaign, and I hope you can support me in this cause.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Invention</h2>
<p>When I got a problem with a smartphone mount that I bought, I started brainstorming for better ways to fit my smartphone in my car. And then I came up with an idea to <strong>mount it on the dashboard behind the steering wheel</strong>.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478299538/fsisqajny5lokodrg4hu.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Made for safety</h3>
<p>The idea was a perfect solution for me because I could operate my smartphone while holding the steering wheel and always could <strong>stay focused on the road</strong>. It is <strong>a much safer way to drive</strong>. I was happy as I could <strong>save lives</strong> with this solution. So many car accidents happen every year. Nowadays many people can’t imagine their lives without smartphones. And unfortunately, they use the smartphone while driving even though it is dangerous. With DASHMO the smartphone <strong>gets mounted quickly in a moment</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Affordable</h3>
<p>I wanted everyone to have DASHMO. Thus I spend special attentions to its design to make it one of the most <strong>affordable and high-quality product</strong>. I came up with <strong>one part design</strong>. It reduces the production cost by eliminating the assembly and reducing the component count, which makes it possible to be<strong> made in Europe</strong> with <strong>high-quality materials </strong>under <strong>European standards</strong> for an affordable price.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478322122/aqi5osfloj6ibyio34rd.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h3>Durable</h3>
<p>And also this unique design improves its quality because it <strong>eliminates moving parts which wear out quickly</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Material properties vs mechanical joints</h3>
<p>Rather using mechanical joints to make the job done, I instead made use of its <strong>material properties</strong> like microchips do nowadays. It is very hard to do, but when done right it has <strong>many benefits</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Fused synthetic rubber skin</h3>
<p>Also, I added <strong>high-quality synthetic rubber</strong> skin which gave it <strong>ultra-high grip</strong>. The rubber skin gets <strong>fused</strong> with the core material directly in the production mold, which means that the <strong>skin will never come off</strong>.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478310794/fblb8olzmu8idxbwmjod.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Elegant design</h3>
<p>And of course, if something is affordable it does not mean, that it has to look ugly. DASHMO’s <strong>unique and beautiful design</strong> which is stylish and pleasing to the eye proves it.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>All-in-One</h3>
<p>DASHMO is mounted in <strong>cars</strong>, <strong>bicycles,</strong> used as a <strong>table stand</strong> and has <strong>many other purposes</strong>. It <strong>fits on all smartphones with or without</strong><strong> a case/cover</strong>. In automobiles, it mounts on the <strong>dashboard</strong>, on the <strong>steering wheel,</strong> and <strong>sun visor</strong>. Passenger right next to the driver can use his smartphone on sun visor as well. And on bikes, it mounts on any frame pipe with a diameter greater than 27mm and less than 40mm. On the table, it can be repositioned very fast from <strong>portlet</strong> to <strong>landscape</strong> stand. With DASHMO you have not restricted yourself anymore where to mount your phone. Mount it where you wish!</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Optimal visibility and voice recording</h3>
<p>DASHMO mounts a smartphone near in front of the driver while retaining <strong>optimal view on the road</strong>. It makes it possible to <strong>see even small letters on the screen</strong>, and it is <strong>optimal chose for video calls</strong>. Because the microphone is near the driver in front of him, the caller can hear him much better.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Everything stays accessible</h3>
<p>DASHMO does not obscure controls, air vents or CD slot on the dashboard in your car, unlike many other mounts.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Most reliable</h3>
<p>DASHMO <strong>does not fall while driving</strong>, unlike many other mounts. It <strong>grips firmly</strong> because of its rubber skin and does not come off because of its unique mechanical connection.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Very stable</h3>
<p>DASHMO <strong>does not vibrate or move</strong> while driving.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>No stickers required</h3>
<p>DASHMO does not need any stickers to hold a phone or to mount itself to the car.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Very fast and simple to use</h3>
<p>DASHMO <strong>mounts and removes easily</strong> in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Compact</h3>
<p>DASHMO is small. It easily fits in the car’s door shelf. It can be taken along for use on a bike, as a table stand or for any other use.</p>
<p> </p>

When I got a problem with a smartphone mount that I bought, I started brainstorming for better ways to fit my smartphone in my car. And then I came up with an idea to mount it on the dashboard behind the steering wheel.

 As flagship smartphones continue to get bigger, more complicated and increasingly fragile, they don't necessarily meet the demands of active outdoor lifestyles. We previously designed Jelly, and now we are taking that concept and pushing the limits to the next level with Atom - an IP68 certified rugged outdoor phone with 4G compatibility. It is waterproof, dustproof, and shockproof, making it is the perfect phone for your outdoor adventures, business trips, and daily life. Atom - Key Features
     The mini-sized design doesn't diminish the powerful features of Atom. It runs Android 8.1 Oreo and includes an Octa-core CPU, fingerprint scanner, NFC features and Corning Gorilla Glass.

<p><br/>TEMPERED GLASS has driven its way to the industry during the last year. Before buying my own personal tempered glass cover about a year ago, I had NO idea what this meant. After a little digging and researching, I found out it is made by heating the glass and then cooling it very quickly. This type of glass breaks differently than normal glass, creating more rounded edges of glass pieces instead of jagged shards that regular glass creates. A tempered glass protector is a multi-layered screen protector. It has a bottom layer of absorbent silicon, PET film and an optically clear adhesive tempered glass and oleophobic coating in that order. Tempered glass is up to five times stronger than normal glass. </p>
<p>Tempered glass is more heat resistant than regular glass, meaning your phone is less likely to be damaged by heat. Plastic screen protectors are much more likely to be scratched than tempered glass protectors, which are up to five times as thick than standard plastic protectors. The smoothness and clarity of the tempered glass makes the screen protector feel more like your actual smart phone screen than a plastic screen cover would. Generally, tempered glass screen protectors are generally easier to put on your phone than plastic screen protectors.</p>
<p>So, how to combine the solution of the first problem without deteriorating the technology of tempered glass?<br/></p>

<li>My name is Hide Kanakubo and I am the president of W-in
     Corporation USA.  I have been in the CE and Telecommunication
     industry for the last 35 years.  I have managed and
     headed the US operations of a large telecommunicationand consumer
     electronics product manufacturer from Japan, so I am experienced in
     overseeing a development of a new product from its conceptual stage to
     mass production. Our team that I have put together consists of
     professionals from CE, IT and wireless industry with extensive knowledge
     and experiencesin the field where this project belongs to with good
     track records respectively.   We are starting a new
     project called <b>Smart Global Communication System</b> to promote a
     new communication convergence system and its service for small
     offices and home offices to solve their daily issues.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>While the last decade has seen a wireless substitution
     of landline service by mobile service, the demographics of global
     analog landline subscriber numbers among analog PSTN based numbers and IP
     based landline numbers has stayed around 1.7Billion number. 
     Why?  We believe it is because there are
     still ""PLACES"" where communal landline-based
     numbers are mandatory for all the workers in the facilities or
     communal groups to share.  Also, the emerging countries globally are
     finally overcoming the lack of their landline infrastructures and are
     shifting their concentrated reliance on the wireless communication service
     to landline based usage especiallyfor the
     communal “PLACES” like offices, restaurants, hospitals and schools.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In
     the world today that revolves and evolves around mobile
     technology, its entrenchment into every nook and corner of daily life
     is not only altering the daily life style, but also corporate work force
     structure.  By 2016, they are expecting 300 million mobile workers
     and 150 million telecommuters who rely their daily business communication
     heavily on a mobile phone.  BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) concept of
     using personal mobile phone as a part of business communication
     requirements is going to be a norm and providing mobile expense
     reimbursements to its sales force becomes an expensive burden for the
     company budget. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We
     believe our proposed system and service will help small office and home
     office or residential home deploy flexible communication service and lead
     to  communication expense reduction and enable the use of converged
     service not only to fully utilize what they already have but also to get
     more mileage out of the incumbent services.   We have initiated a piece
     of the solution puzzles by successfully developing a  product called
     PhonelinX that converges landline phone service with your smart phone as
     if smart phone hasbecome
     a cordless telephone extension to your landline phone service.  The
     following is the link to PhonelinX presentation video. </li>
</ul>
<p> <a href=""http://player.vimeo.com/external/84264466.sd.mp4?s=6eefe9a140e06bb167a2db8dcbed5470"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><u>http://player.vimeo.com/external/84264466.sd.mp4?s=6eefe9a140e06bb167a2db8dcbed5470</u></span></a></p>
<ul>
<li>However, we believe the real goal of our system and
     service is to provide a global communication solution to the user.
      In order to realize the global extensionof PhonelinX
     operation, we need to develop cloud based applications and host
     communication services on a cloud system.And we look
     for your contributionto help us develop the applications
     and modify the firmware inside PhonelinX to enable such applications and
     services globally.  When such global connectivity is
     established on the converged services between smart phone and the
     office/home phone service, while sitting in a café  inParis, you can
     call your business customers in USA from your US office phone number(service), thus
     eliminating the need for any international roamingcharges or
     even mobile minutes.  While you are on a business trip abroad,
      you can push an extension to talk to people in your communication
     community on intercom without having to dial cumbersome international
     dialing sequence through roaming service or knowing such dialing sequence.
      Our plannedSmart Remote Pairing application enables you to send a
     text to your parents smart phones, and automatically configure their
     smartphones tobecome an extension to your community group so that
     the  next call with them will be an intercom call.   </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The contribution and the support that you backers make
     will enable us to accelerate the sales and deployment of PhonelinX and
     when Smart Global Communication System in motion, the PhonelinX will
     transform itself from a  local utility and solution provider to
     global communication solution provider. While we start building a
     sustainable business with PhonelinX, we will start to develop the next
     generation “AirTouch One” terminal with more advanced features with
     selective local connectivity for controlling peripheral terminals within
     office and home thus creating a generic global end to end (from smart
     phone to home/office premise) delivery highway as a home gateway for
     various digital services.  Your $350,000.00 contribution will
     gear us up on the improvements and upgrades on the current applications
     for Phonelinx and the firmware change within PhonelinX so that remote
     modifications and updates will become possible and PhonelinX can also
     take advantage of the new global connectivity applications that are
     being developed simultaneously.  $350,000.00 will also help
     finish up the development of  “AirTouch One” hardware and firmware.
     If we fall short of completing the target amount, we will be able to
     finish up the PhonelinX firmware change and the new global features that
     PhonelinX can operate. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>As you have seen in the video, we have successfully
     finished developing PhonelinX hardware, firmware, smart phone applications
     that control PhonelinX features, and we are at the point of
     commercialization.  We developed the world first docking station that
     has both cellular and PSTN line inside a cordless telephone that we had
     successfully sold to many US carriers. Our team members all have several
     projects that they led to successful implementation.  Because of the
     nature of PhonelinX and its associated services being the consultative
     sales orientation, we are trying our best to promote consumer awareness of
     the product.  We did a few limited but expensive testing of buying 60
     seconds spot on TV media, but had a very positive responses from customers
     who either called in or purchased PhonelinX on the website.  We
     are in discussion with one of the largest TV shopping network in USA for
     running promotions on PhonelinX to create awareness among the consumer so
     that we are setting up a stage for national retail distribution. 
     While we prioritize PhonelinX deployment through landline telephone
     companies and cable companies, the process to get their interest, get
     their technical team to evaluate, and their management to package the
     product with some sales programs and campaigns are tedious process and
     sometimes it takes months.  We have started to promote PhonelinX with
     the expected global features to those carriers in both North and South
     America as we believe that our PhonelinX and its global services can help
     them retain their consumer as well as enterprise customers for their
     service by giving them additional value to their landline service as a
     part of the comprehensive global communication service package. For W-in to
     build product and service awareness through various channels will also
     help convince these landline carriers and cable companies to support our
     product into their portfolio.  Because of other products that
     we have been involved with, we have relationship with several major
     landline carriers as well as cable companies which will help us
     present the new endeavor that a completely new comer would find difficult
     to start. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We are also initiating a discussion to build a
     synergistic relationship with one of the largest SIP base chat service
     provider and provide our service as a  part of their service
     portfolio to entice enterprise customers to subscribe and if successfully
     implemented, we will be exposed to their 500M customersovernight.
      Our sales strategy is semi-spiral and targeting the prospective
     customers from both ends, hardware sales and subscriptions and free
     subscription that leads to a purchase of hardware.  Just like
     some chat services that generated 200M active users within 2 years, word
     of the mouth andinvitation to use our free applications may help create
     our subscriber base quickly and thus leading to hardware adaptation for
     additional services.</li>

</ul></div>","My name is Hide Kanakubo and I am the president of W-in
     Corporation USA.  I have been in the CE and Telecommunication
     industry for the last 35 years.  I have managed and
     headed the US operations of a large telecommunicationand consumer
     electronics product manufacturer from Japan, so I am experienced in
     overseeing a development of a new product from its conceptual stage to
     mass production. Our team that I have put together consists of
     professionals from CE, IT and wireless industry with extensive knowledge
     and experiencesin the field where this project belongs to with good
     track records respectively.   We are starting a new
     project called Smart Global Communication System to promote a
     new communication convergence system and its service for small
     offices and home offices to solve their daily issues.


While the last decade has seen a wireless substitution
     of landline service by mobile service, the demographics of global
     analog landline subscriber numbers among analog PSTN based numbers and IP
     based landline numbers has stayed around 1.7Billion number. 
     Why?  We believe it is because there are
     still ""PLACES"" where communal landline-based
     numbers are mandatory for all the workers in the facilities or
     communal groups to share.  Also, the emerging countries globally are
     finally overcoming the lack of their landline infrastructures and are
     shifting their concentrated reliance on the wireless communication service
     to landline based usage especiallyfor the
     communal “PLACES” like offices, restaurants, hospitals and schools.


In
     the world today that revolves and evolves around mobile
     technology, its entrenchment into every nook and corner of daily life
     is not only altering the daily life style, but also corporate work force
     structure.  By 2016, they are expecting 300 million mobile workers
     and 150 million telecommuters who rely their daily business communication
     heavily on a mobile phone.  BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) concept of
     using personal mobile phone as a part of business communication
     requirements is going to be a norm and providing mobile expense
     reimbursements to its sales force becomes an expensive burden for the
     company budget. 


We
     believe our proposed system and service will help small office and home
     office or residential home deploy flexible communication service and lead
     to  communication expense reduction and enable the use of converged
     service not only to fully utilize what they already have but also to get
     more mileage out of the incumbent services.   We have initiated a piece
     of the solution puzzles by successfully developing a  product called
     PhonelinX that converges landline phone service with your smart phone as
     if smart phone hasbecome
     a cordless telephone extension to your landline phone service.  The
     following is the link to PhonelinX presentation video. 

 http://player.vimeo.com/external/84264466.sd.mp4?s=6eefe9a140e06bb167a2db8dcbed5470

However, we believe the real goal of our system and
     service is to provide a global communication solution to the user.
      In order to realize the global extensionof PhonelinX
     operation, we need to develop cloud based applications and host
     communication services on a cloud system.And we look
     for your contributionto help us develop the applications
     and modify the firmware inside PhonelinX to enable such applications and
     services globally.  When such global connectivity is
     established on the converged services between smart phone and the
     office/home phone service, while sitting in a café  inParis, you can
     call your business customers in USA from your US office phone number(service), thus
     eliminating the need for any international roamingcharges or
     even mobile minutes.  While you are on a business trip abroad,
      you can push an extension to talk to people in your communication
     community on intercom without having to dial cumbersome international
     dialing sequence through roaming service or knowing such dialing sequence.
      Our plannedSmart Remote Pairing application enables you to send a
     text to your parents smart phones, and automatically configure their
     smartphones tobecome an extension to your community group so that
     the  next call with them will be an intercom call.   


The contribution and the support that you backers make
     will enable us to accelerate the sales and deployment of PhonelinX and
     when Smart Global Communication System in motion, the PhonelinX will
     transform itself from a  local utility and solution provider to
     global communication solution provider. While we start building a
     sustainable business with PhonelinX, we will start to develop the next
     generation “AirTouch One” terminal with more advanced features with
     selective local connectivity for controlling peripheral terminals within
     office and home thus creating a generic global end to end (from smart
     phone to home/office premise) delivery highway as a home gateway for
     various digital services.  Your $350,000.00 contribution will
     gear us up on the improvements and upgrades on the current applications
     for Phonelinx and the firmware change within PhonelinX so that remote
     modifications and updates will become possible and PhonelinX can also
     take advantage of the new global connectivity applications that are
     being developed simultaneously.  $350,000.00 will also help
     finish up the development of  “AirTouch One” hardware and firmware.
     If we fall short of completing the target amount, we will be able to
     finish up the PhonelinX firmware change and the new global features that
     PhonelinX can operate. 


As you have seen in the video, we have successfully
     finished developing PhonelinX hardware, firmware, smart phone applications
     that control PhonelinX features, and we are at the point of
     commercialization.  We developed the world first docking station that
     has both cellular and PSTN line inside a cordless telephone that we had
     successfully sold to many US carriers. Our team members all have several
     projects that they led to successful implementation.  Because of the
     nature of PhonelinX and its associated services being the consultative
     sales orientation, we are trying our best to promote consumer awareness of
     the product.  We did a few limited but expensive testing of buying 60
     seconds spot on TV media, but had a very positive responses from customers
     who either called in or purchased PhonelinX on the website.  We
     are in discussion with one of the largest TV shopping network in USA for
     running promotions on PhonelinX to create awareness among the consumer so
     that we are setting up a stage for national retail distribution. 
     While we prioritize PhonelinX deployment through landline telephone
     companies and cable companies, the process to get their interest, get
     their technical team to evaluate, and their management to package the
     product with some sales programs and campaigns are tedious process and
     sometimes it takes months.  We have started to promote PhonelinX with
     the expected global features to those carriers in both North and South
     America as we believe that our PhonelinX and its global services can help
     them retain their consumer as well as enterprise customers for their
     service by giving them additional value to their landline service as a
     part of the comprehensive global communication service package. For W-in to
     build product and service awareness through various channels will also
     help convince these landline carriers and cable companies to support our
     product into their portfolio.  Because of other products that
     we have been involved with, we have relationship with several major
     landline carriers as well as cable companies which will help us
     present the new endeavor that a completely new comer would find difficult
     to start. 


We are also initiating a discussion to build a
     synergistic relationship with one of the largest SIP base chat service
     provider and provide our service as a  part of their service
     portfolio to entice enterprise customers to subscribe and if successfully
     implemented, we will be exposed to their 500M customersovernight.
      Our sales strategy is semi-spiral and targeting the prospective
     customers from both ends, hardware sales and subscriptions and free
     subscription that leads to a purchase of hardware.  Just like
     some chat services that generated 200M active users within 2 years, word
     of the mouth andinvitation to use our free applications may help create
     our subscriber base quickly and thus leading to hardware adaptation for
     additional services.


The contribution from the bakers do not have to take the
     form of pledged monetary contribution. We would like to ask that all the
     backers and believers in our project to download the free applications
     when they are available and use them during the free promotional period or
     free terms per community configuration ( We are thinking about charging a
     monthly fee for usage per 5 extensions at a time. So up to 4 extensions,
     for a limited time, we will enable the free utilization of some of the
     global features.)  If a few % of the
     service users see the benefits and commit to subscribe, that will generate
     additional potential purchase for our hardware terminals as well for their
     own applications.

It has been almost 10 months now but during this time I have prepared two hardware revisions of “Joker TV” with various fixes. I also wrote software for FPGA and the host (for Linux/OSx/Windows) from scratch. This was a lot of work but now I’m ready to share all of it with you. I have decided to donate my work to the community and make this project an Open Hardware and Open Software project. Here is a post with additional information.Additionally, I have just placed the first batch order to the factory and I’m anticipating the results which should be ready in about three (3) weeks. I will send freshly baked “Joker TV” gadgets to all backers! Once again, thanks for waiting, I do apologize for delay!Stay tuned ! 30 September 2016Good news Everyone !Stylish box is here ! Work in progress ... stay tuned !       16 September 2016Good news Everyone !First samples is here ! Work in progress ... stay tuned !  10 August 2016Good news Everyone !""Zero"" hardware revision is finally here.  Cool shot was made :) I'll start hardware testing and work on software part (FPGA firmware and drivers). So far so good. Everything is going as planned. I will post progress into this campaign. Stay tuned ! Good news Everyone !06 July 2016""Zero"" hardware revision now in production. I'm waiting first hardware samples in few weeks (usually it takes 2-3 weeks for full assembly) - before the end of July 2016. Here is a case drawings draft and 3d models of the board.      Notice: I have decided to split RF-inputs - first for Satellite Dish and second for Terrestrial antenna. This allows to power (5v) Terrestrial antenna for better radio performance.  Good news Everyone !* If this campaign will be funded for 100% ($50k) I will make this project Open Hardware ! All schematic and PCB will be available on http://jokersys.com website.* If this campaign will be funded for 200% ($100k) I will donate 10 pcs. of Joker TV gadget for educational organizations (just drop me email with brief description of your educational program).* If this campaign will be funded for 300% ($150k) I will prepare OSx drivers for MacBooks. Open source, of course :) Let's make best DTV receiver together ! Please share this info withfriends or on open-source/open-hardware sites and forums !Big thanks for all !F.A.Q * What this device dedicated for ?It's small and compact Terrestrial and Satellite TV receiver for laptops, tablets and PC's. * Which channels I can receive ?It depends on your location. Terrestrial TV is usually distributed by local TV provider and consist of local TV channels and some global TV channels. For example, in Florida you can receive more than 400 FREE TV channels ! Here is a link for summary: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_televisio...I'm planning to make updates for available TV channels in different regions of the world. * Do I need internet connection to receive TV channels ?No* Do I need to pay for TV channels ?Basically no. Terrestrial and some of satellite channels usually free of charge (so called FTA channels). Some satellite channels requires CAM module and smart card - in this case you should pay for TV provider. * Dimension ?D/W/H = 130/80/25 mm.Weight: 200 gr. I'm on vacation in Florida, USA.

Without the right tools, helping our clients is difficult. This problem is more common in the wireless domain, where security experts and hardware and software developers have limited high quality and high power monitoring and testing hardware available to them. There is nothing that allows them to rapidly switch among functions such as testing radio cards, simultaneous scanning on multiple frequencies, and monitoring wireless data in dynamic environments.<br/><br/>At ALFTEL, one of the things we have learned is that sometimes you have to do things yourself if you want to get things done right. Out of the need for a flexible, robust and reliable tool, we created AIRBUD.<br/> </p><h3 style=""text-align: justify;"">What Are The Problems With Wireless Testing?</h3><p style=""text-align: justify;"">We did our research. Here is what we know about the WiFi pentesting and development environment:</p><ol style=""text-align: justify;"">
<li>There are many powerful open source applications for WiFi testing and monitoring (like Aircrack-ng and Kismet) that are usually bundled into Linux distributions like Kali and Parrot Security OS or other custom crafted Linux installations.<br/> </li>
<li>Most people tend to use single-radio USB WiFi dongles because it is easy. There are challenges with this approach:<br/> <ul>
<li>There are very few chipsets compatible with Aircrack-ng and Kismet (monitor and injection mode support).</li>
<li>You are limited to the frequency bands available on the single radio implementation.</li>
<li>The only Airckack-ng and Kismet friendly USB dongle with 802.11a coverage (Ralink chipset) is no longer being produced and will soon be unavailable.</li>
<li>USB 2.0 has limited bandwidth for high speed 802.11ac/n in dual/triple chain modes.</li>
<li>Linux USB device drivers are generally not as robust as PCIe device drivers.</li>
<li>Many new USB 3.0 wireless dongles have “old USB 2.0” on the inside, having unknown compatibility with pentesting tools, have limited range, and use low power internal ceramic chip antennas.</li>
<li>Using multiple USB WiFi dongles to cover more channels and frequencies leads to bulky construction with multi-port hubs.</li>
<li>USB can only support low power radio cards (2.5W) without clumsy external power supplies.</li>
<li>Multiple USB dongles with external antennas become difficult to manage and generally use lower quality/power antennas.</li>
<li> </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol><h3><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans Medium"", Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;letter-spacing: 0px;'>What Are The Solutions To These Problems?</span></h3><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Unable to find a suitable device in the market, we undertook to improve the current state of technology in the wireless domain. Our end goals were to develop a solution that:</p><ul style=""text-align: justify;"">
<li>Provides the WiFi pentesting and open source development communities with a powerful and flexible tool for testing and monitoring, that would allow simultaneous use of multiple radio cards.</li>
<li>Is compact, self-contained, adaptable to future technology and easy to use; a small device that is low in cost, high in performance, and flexible across multiple operating systems and tools.</li>
<li>Creates the type of robust and flexible hardware that will support our own IT Security services</li>
</ul><div> </div><p> </p><p> </p><h3>How Did We Arrive at AIRBUD's Specs?</h3><p style=""text-align: justify;"">We started off by searching for low power processors. ARM CPUs have a deep level of community support and development tools to go along with them. However, it was frustrating to be at the mercy of vendors’ kernel patches and hope that they would match with our interface requirements for an ARM CPU. Additionally, it was difficult to find reliable support in Linux for PCIe on most ARM processors.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">We found success when we turned to Intel’s newer multi-core low power processors. Their advanced technology had the potential to provide the power profile we were looking for. They also have the added benefit of being able to use any x86 compatible OS and application, which includes Windows and virtualized environments. In particular, the Cherry Trail and Braswell processors offer speedy quad core variants with a very low thermal design profile in the 2W-7W range.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Next, we chose the mini PCI express form factor that gave us the adaptability we needed and kept us in line with the upcoming M.2 technology. This also allows for the power and versatility of using multiple simultaneous radio cards, as well as allowing for other types of mini PCIe and M.2 form factor cards. We would now also have a handy test platform for card function and compatibility without using clumsy external adapters or needing to disassemble our equipment.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">PCIe radio cards, like Mikrotik, allow us to use<a href=""https://www.alftel.com/pages/indiegogoairbudcableantennaadapterset"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> sturdy MMCX RF connectors and high-quality N-type antennas</a>, something not available with USB Wi-Fi dongles. The end result is that high power radio cards can operate at maximum capacity, much like mating well-designed speakers to a high end Hi-Fi audio system.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Finally, we added multiple PCIe interfaces so users can work with up to six radio cards simultaneously and in parallel with one another.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Our resulting wireless appliance is a best of breed penetration testing tool and hardware or software development platform. It is future-proofed by the ability to easily and quickly switch out the radio cards and CPU module as technology advances.</p><p> </p><h3>What Are AIRBUD's Features?</h3><p style=""text-align: justify;"">After exhaustive debate and discussion about what should be included and excluded, we settled on the following features:</p><ul style=""text-align: justify;"">
<li>Intel quad code Cherry Trail processor with 4W TDP (Thermal Design Profile) - the same processors found in modern 2-in-1  PCs.</li>
<li>An affordable and customizable CPU module that allows for easy upgrades.</li>
<li>As many mini PCIe slots as possible through a PCIe switch.</li>
<li>Support for ANY standard mini PCIe card: up to 7W per slot, PCIe Bus, I2C Bus, USB 2.0 Bus, SIM card interface.</li>
<li>USB 3.0 and HDMI video.</li>
<li>Serial console interface over USB</li>
<li>Ample flash memory and enough RAM to work smoothly with Linux and Windows.</li>
<li>MicroSD card slot for additional storage needs.</li>
<li>Support for cellular modem (SIM card slot) and GPS cards.</li>
<li>Power circuit design for support of high-power radio cards in each slot.</li>
<li>Small form factor.</li>

Stand by for more, but remember that early supporters will likely get the most benefit.We are just weeks away from placing our order for the first production run. This will happen even if our goal is not met, and all our supporters will receive the perks they signed up for. Once the campaign ends, we will switch to commercial sales of AIRBUD at more realistic market prices for such a powerful platform. What We Need & What You Get The design work is finished and the components have been selected. We are in the final stages of testing our prototypes. We are looking to hit a funding goal of 75,000 USD, which will help us with the first production run. We appreciate your support and have created perks to express our gratitude. Depending on your level of interest and involvement, we are offering a fully functional AIRBUD PCB, a 60W power supply, an open style acrylic assembly, and a complete set of antennas and connectors (see Cables, Antennas and Adapters for a full description). These are ready for assembly and populating with radio cards of your choice. All systems will come with the latest Ubuntu Server, Kali Linux, Parrot Security OS and Windows 10 Evaluation pre-installed. If you are not ready yet to try our AIRBUD platform, but are excited about what we are doing, you can still help our development work by opting for the $25 perk. This will be used as part of our documentation and training material development project. Check out our perks section for more details.We are committed to making AIRBUD a reality. It is important to our team and the wireless test enthusiast community. Your support is needed to help recover the initial development and production costs. We are committed to rewarding your support by delivering the chosen perks to each of our supporters, even if the campaign goal is not reached, and we will use the knowledge and experience gained from working on a successfully funded Kickstarter campaign to help make this happen. Why Are We Doing This?As IT security professionals, we need easy access to high quality tools. Without the right tools, helping our clients is difficult. This problem is more common in the wireless domain, where security experts and hardware and software developers have limited high quality and high power monitoring and testing hardware available to them. There is nothing that allows them to rapidly switch among functions such as testing radio cards, simultaneous scanning on multiple frequencies, and monitoring wireless data in dynamic environments.At ALFTEL, one of the things we have learned is that sometimes you have to do things yourself if you want to get things done right. Out of the need for a flexible, robust and reliable tool, we created AIRBUD. What Are The Problems With Wireless Testing?We did our research. Here is what we know about the WiFi pentesting and development environment:
There are many powerful open source applications for WiFi testing and monitoring (like Aircrack-ng and Kismet) that are usually bundled into Linux distributions like Kali and Parrot Security OS or other custom crafted Linux installations. 
Most people tend to use single-radio USB WiFi dongles because it is easy. There are challenges with this approach: 
There are very few chipsets compatible with Aircrack-ng and Kismet (monitor and injection mode support).
You are limited to the frequency bands available on the single radio implementation.
The only Airckack-ng and Kismet friendly USB dongle with 802.11a coverage (Ralink chipset) is no longer being produced and will soon be unavailable.
USB 2.0 has limited bandwidth for high speed 802.11ac/n in dual/triple chain modes.
Linux USB device drivers are generally not as robust as PCIe device drivers.
Many new USB 3.0 wireless dongles have “old USB 2.0” on the inside, having unknown compatibility with pentesting tools, have limited range, and use low power internal ceramic chip antennas.
Using multiple USB WiFi dongles to cover more channels and frequencies leads to bulky construction with multi-port hubs.
USB can only support low power radio cards (2.5W) without clumsy external power supplies.
Multiple USB dongles with external antennas become difficult to manage and generally use lower quality/power antennas.
 


What Are The Solutions To These Problems?Unable to find a suitable device in the market, we undertook to improve the current state of technology in the wireless domain. Our end goals were to develop a solution that:
Provides the WiFi pentesting and open source development communities with a powerful and flexible tool for testing and monitoring, that would allow simultaneous use of multiple radio cards.
Is compact, self-contained, adaptable to future technology and easy to use; a small device that is low in cost, high in performance, and flexible across multiple operating systems and tools.
Creates the type of robust and flexible hardware that will support our own IT Security services
   How Did We Arrive at AIRBUD's Specs?We started off by searching for low power processors. ARM CPUs have a deep level of community support and development tools to go along with them. However, it was frustrating to be at the mercy of vendors’ kernel patches and hope that they would match with our interface requirements for an ARM CPU. Additionally, it was difficult to find reliable support in Linux for PCIe on most ARM processors.We found success when we turned to Intel’s newer multi-core low power processors. Their advanced technology had the potential to provide the power profile we were looking for. They also have the added benefit of being able to use any x86 compatible OS and application, which includes Windows and virtualized environments. In particular, the Cherry Trail and Braswell processors offer speedy quad core variants with a very low thermal design profile in the 2W-7W range.Next, we chose the mini PCI express form factor that gave us the adaptability we needed and kept us in line with the upcoming M.2 technology. This also allows for the power and versatility of using multiple simultaneous radio cards, as well as allowing for other types of mini PCIe and M.2 form factor cards. We would now also have a handy test platform for card function and compatibility without using clumsy external adapters or needing to disassemble our equipment.PCIe radio cards, like Mikrotik, allow us to use sturdy MMCX RF connectors and high-quality N-type antennas, something not available with USB Wi-Fi dongles. The end result is that high power radio cards can operate at maximum capacity, much like mating well-designed speakers to a high end Hi-Fi audio system.Finally, we added multiple PCIe interfaces so users can work with up to six radio cards simultaneously and in parallel with one another.Our resulting wireless appliance is a best of breed penetration testing tool and hardware or software development platform. It is future-proofed by the ability to easily and quickly switch out the radio cards and CPU module as technology advances. What Are AIRBUD's Features?After exhaustive debate and discussion about what should be included and excluded, we settled on the following features:
Intel quad code Cherry Trail processor with 4W TDP (Thermal Design Profile) - the same processors found in modern 2-in-1  PCs.
An affordable and customizable CPU module that allows for easy upgrades.
As many mini PCIe slots as possible through a PCIe switch.
Support for ANY standard mini PCIe card: up to 7W per slot, PCIe Bus, I2C Bus, USB 2.0 Bus, SIM card interface.
USB 3.0 and HDMI video.
Serial console interface over USB
Ample flash memory and enough RAM to work smoothly with Linux and Windows.
MicroSD card slot for additional storage needs.
Support for cellular modem (SIM card slot) and GPS cards.
Power circuit design for support of high-power radio cards in each slot.
Small form factor.

 What Have We Achieved to Date?    
Created proof of concept prototypes outfitted with different Mikrotik radio cards and delivered them to the developer of Aircrack-ng during DEFCON 24 in Las Vegas, 2016, pictured here:

Completed several development stages: Architecture, circuit design, component choice, schematics, PCB layout, manufacturer selection, and receipt of the first engineering pre-production samples.
Outfitted some engineering samples with different Mikrotik and Intel radio cards along with GPS modules and delivered for review and evaluation to the following companies: Kismet Wireless, Acrylic Wifi (multi-boot installation with Windows 10 and Kali Linux), and Parrot Security OS (multi-boot installation with Parrot Security OS and Kali Linux), pictured below: 


We did prepare another demo unit housed in extruded aluminum case and will deliver it shortly to OpenWRT community developers for evaluation and potentially creating USB/CD installation packages. We see a great opportunity for developing extended OpenWRT applications.

Explored different design ideas for case enclosures adapted to various applications.
Approached possible partners to extend their software applications to take advantage of our powerful hardware platform.
Launched this Indiegogo campaign to help fund the production of AIRBUD and bring it to market.
 Risks & ChallengesAs with any technology project, there are risks. Examples include unpredictable issues such as supply chain, component availability, design, compatibility and integrating various hardware and software components. We, at ALFTEL, are using our decades of product development experience to minimize these risks by working closely with our supply chain partners, closely reviewing designs and monitoring intermediate results. We are using engineering samples which closely approximate the design to test radio cards with widely available software and to eliminate flaws in the mechanical design and firmware.  We are also using our first samples to work with select leaders in the wireless community to test our solutions.  Other Ways You Can Help

<i>Next Generation Computer Defense</i><br/><br/>
</h3><p></p><p>Our whole life's are on our laptops: music, photos, finances. We think that we are keeping ourselves safe online. However, cyber criminals are actually watching us online gathering our passwords and personal information. Next thing you know, the computer is wiped clean and so is your bank account.</p><p>The founders of Daily Safety Check realized that the same technologies and methods used to protect banks, which are constantly under attack, could be adapted to protect home and small business computers.  Any top quality security system has principles, whether guarding a high risk computer system, or protecting a building, or even bodyguards protecting the president: prevention, detection and response.</p><div>1. Prevention<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>External prevention: As you would expect from Daily Safety Check, we have partnered with the best antivirus software available on the market, fully integrated with our product.  At no extra cost to you.</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>Internal prevention: No system that looks exclusively at external threats is safe. The largest vulnerability in most home computer systems is out of date software.  Major programs like Adobe Acrobat, Flash, Microsoft Office and others, have regular security fixes that antivirus cannot fix and was not designed to protect.</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p>2. Detection<br/></p>
<div>
<ul><li>Computer Forensics:   Even if an intruder steals a password or makes it past your defenses, Daily Safety Check still performs daily checks for telltale signs of an attack, such as changes to user accounts, security settings and hard drive usage.</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p>3. Response</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>Awareness: You would never install a home security system without an alarm. Why should your computer be different? Millions of people have viruses on their computer right now and have no idea that their passwords, financial information and sensitive documents have been compromised.  Daily Safety Check provides real time monitoring, with email alerts so you know if someone is attacking your computer.</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>

Daily Safety Check

Next Generation Computer Defense
Our whole life's are on our laptops: music, photos, finances. We think that we are keeping ourselves safe online. However, cyber criminals are actually watching us online gathering our passwords and personal information. Next thing you know, the computer is wiped clean and so is your bank account.The founders of Daily Safety Check realized that the same technologies and methods used to protect banks, which are constantly under attack, could be adapted to protect home and small business computers.  Any top quality security system has principles, whether guarding a high risk computer system, or protecting a building, or even bodyguards protecting the president: prevention, detection and response.1. Prevention

External prevention: As you would expect from Daily Safety Check, we have partnered with the best antivirus software available on the market, fully integrated with our product.  At no extra cost to you.


Internal prevention: No system that looks exclusively at external threats is safe. The largest vulnerability in most home computer systems is out of date software.  Major programs like Adobe Acrobat, Flash, Microsoft Office and others, have regular security fixes that antivirus cannot fix and was not designed to protect.

2. Detection

Computer Forensics:   Even if an intruder steals a password or makes it past your defenses, Daily Safety Check still performs daily checks for telltale signs of an attack, such as changes to user accounts, security settings and hard drive usage.

3. Response

Awareness: You would never install a home security system without an alarm. Why should your computer be different? Millions of people have viruses on their computer right now and have no idea that their passwords, financial information and sensitive documents have been compromised.  Daily Safety Check provides real time monitoring, with email alerts so you know if someone is attacking your computer.


Remediation: Our team of computer security experts will alert you, and provide information that can help you restore your computer.



Why Are We Creating this Project?
We created and developed the system but now we need your help to make this available for everyone. Through your financial contribution, you become a soldier in the battle against the cyber war that is upon us. We need that investment to strengthen our infrastructure, marketing, and development. Become a soldier and join the DSC ARMY today.

Why Do We Need Daily Safety Check? The cyber world is more dangerous than it has ever been. In just the last year, there has been a staggering increase in the number and sophistication of cyber attacks on home computers. Is your antivirus software keeping you safe?Top 4 myths of home computer securityMyth 1: If I have antivirus software installed, then I am safe


Reality: Antivirus is only a small part securing any computer.

1/3 of computers that have up-to-date antivirus software installed have a virus right now, according to security firm SurfRight.
4 out of 5 computers have at least one security vulnerability that has nothing to do with virus or malware protection
Other programs can let hackers in, such as Adobe Acrobat, Flash, Office, Java and many more
Daily Safety Check ensures your entire computer is safe.


Myth 2: I don't need to worry. I don't have anything but music, photos and videos on my computer


Reality: Hackers are increasingly focused on home computers.

Hackers increasingly use viruses to steal your identity. Modern malware can sit on your computer for months, building a profile of your identity, finances, passwords and sensitive documents.
The average identity theft victim takes 6 months and over 2,000 hours to recover his or her identity. 40% haven't recovered their identity after a full year! Source: Federal Trade Commission.
How much of your life is online or on your computer? People live their lives through the digital wold, with photos, videos, music and documents all at risk from a hacker attack.
Daily Safety Check gives you bank-strength security, so hackers choose easier targets. 


Myth 3:Cybercrime isn't any worse now than in the past


Reality: Cybercrime is up sharply in the last year, and getting worse

Fast Company called 2012 the Cybercrime ""Hell Year"" because of the large number of attacks so far
Cybercrime in 2014 was about $12.7 million in the U.S., compared to $11.56 million in 2013, according to a new Ponemon Institute study.

Cyber crime has experienced staggering growth in the number and sophistication of attacks
Corporate security has changed dramatically in the last few years to adapt to this threat, but antivirus software has not changed significantly in over 6 years
Because home computers are now the weak point, hackers are increasingly focused on compromising the computers of a company's employees and customers to access their systems.
DSC uses the latest in security technology and concepts to keep cyber-criminals away. 


Myth 4: I would know if I had a virus on my computer


Reality: Most viruses and malware don't slow down or crash your computer.

Most people who have a virus or malware have no idea they have been compromised
Modern malware can sit on your computer for months, building a profile of your identity, finances, passwords and sensitive documents.
DSC alerts you if someone is trying to attack your computer.

</div><p><strong>OP1</strong> is a battery additive that is based on conductive organic

all lead acid batteries and we have developed techniques and diagnostic
procedures to qualify batteries before they are replaced.</p><div>
</div><p>With OP1 we are
going to open the first lead acid battery repair shop. We are going to work
with existing repair shops to adopt OP1 as the only alternative to costly
replacements. <strong> Cost savings for the
customer - 70% or more off the cost of a new replacement.</strong></p><div>
<p><strong>Cost Savings  for Customers</strong></p>
<p>Cars - $100 to $300</p>

develop strategies to introduce OP1 to their customer base.  We will document all in order replicate this
approach in any state or country around the world<strong>.</strong>
</div><div>
<p>
</p>
<p>We are looking
to raise $99,950 to open our OP1 repair shop and develop distribution through exiting  repair shops in the USA, as well as,  open international distribution channels. <span>  </span></p>
<p><span>Training seminars and marketing materials
have to be created and inventory purchased. 
</span></p>
<p><span>The initial purchase by repair shops will be on consignment and paid for when used.  For larger batteries and rural customers, we will
provide a mobile repair service. and incorporate existing mobile services. We will
purchase repair and paint old trucks and vans to be stocked with OP1,
replacement parts and tools.  </span></p>

</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>Lead is a toxic metal that
can enter the body by inhalation of lead dust or ingestion when touching the
mouth with lead-contaminated hands. If leaked onto the ground, the acid and
lead particulates contaminate the soil and become airborne when dry. </p>
<p>Children
and fetuses of pregnant women are most vulnerable to lead exposure because
their bodies are developing.</p>
<p>Excessive levels of lead can affect a child’s
growth, cause brain damage, harm kidneys, impair hearing and induce behavioral
problems. </p>
<p>In adults, lead can cause memory loss and lower the ability to
concentrate, as well as harm the reproductive system. Lead is also known to
cause high blood pressure, nerve disorders, and muscle and joint pain.
Researchers believe that Ludwig van Beethoven became ill and died from lead
poisoning. </p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>It is our belief that if we
slow down the number of lead acid batteries going to recycling plants or being
discarded in landfills we can slow down the number 2 cause of toxic pollution
around the world.<span>  And the only way to do

Next time you get your car repaired ask the repair mechanic if they
could repair batteries – would they and send them to Indiegogo.com.  You can spread the word that battery repair
is inevitable and the world can use it.</span></p>
</div></div>","75% of all lead acid
batteries die prematurely because of a residue that remains on the plates and
electrodes.  When this residue hardens
the battery becomes resistant and can no longer function properly.  These batteries are not repaired they are
replaced.
Up until now that is!
OP1 is a battery additive that is based on conductive organic
polymer technology. This technology won the Nobel prize for chemistry in 2000.  OP1 is injected into the cells of any lead acid battery and penetrates the hardened residue causing it to peel off the electrodes. At the same time it coats the plates
and electrodes to prevent this residue from accumulating.


OP1 has succeeded in satisfying battery makers.
OP1 is the world's first successfully developed super
effective additive for the prolongation of lead acid batteries' life. 
OP1 in a new battery = doubles the life of the battery.
OP1 in a used battery = will last as rated -  5 to 10 years.
OP1 in a dead battery = 1 to 3 years with proper maintenance.



































OP1 works on
all lead acid batteries and we have developed techniques and diagnostic
procedures to qualify batteries before they are replaced.
With OP1 we are
going to open the first lead acid battery repair shop. We are going to work
with existing repair shops to adopt OP1 as the only alternative to costly
replacements.  Cost savings for the
customer - 70% or more off the cost of a new replacement.
Cost Savings  for Customers
Cars - $100 to $300
Golf Carts - $1000 to $2000 per 48V pack
Forklifts - $7000 to $15000 per 48V bank
Our
repair shop will provide a lab for the different repair facilities.  Forklift, industrial, golf cart, car, boat,
truck, back-up and electric vehicle batteries repair people can train, test and
develop strategies to introduce OP1 to their customer base.  We will document all in order replicate this
approach in any state or country around the world.



We are looking
to raise $99,950 to open our OP1 repair shop and develop distribution through exiting  repair shops in the USA, as well as,  open international distribution channels.   
Training seminars and marketing materials
have to be created and inventory purchased. 

The initial purchase by repair shops will be on consignment and paid for when used.  For larger batteries and rural customers, we will
provide a mobile repair service. and incorporate existing mobile services. We will
purchase repair and paint old trucks and vans to be stocked with OP1,
replacement parts and tools.  
Already,  there are
several international distribution points that require samples and
demonstration of how OP1 works and its application.   



The Dominican Republic, Jamaica and Africa are starting points for OP1 Distribution internationally and we hope to contribute to the global lead clean up initiatives

As a
contributor you will be part of a new industry that can save you, the consumer, money and
the environment.  New business opportunities can develop where once there were none and you can take credit for that  or even get involved with this exciting venture.
You as a
contributor will also get a chance to become a distributor in your area.   
And when you
put your head down to sleep you can feel or know the mess is going to get
cleaned up.  
If we don’t meet
our goal then we will do the best we can with what you so kindly contributed. 

  
  The Impact


Lead is a toxic metal that
can enter the body by inhalation of lead dust or ingestion when touching the
mouth with lead-contaminated hands. If leaked onto the ground, the acid and
lead particulates contaminate the soil and become airborne when dry. 
Children
and fetuses of pregnant women are most vulnerable to lead exposure because
their bodies are developing.
Excessive levels of lead can affect a child’s
growth, cause brain damage, harm kidneys, impair hearing and induce behavioral
problems. 
In adults, lead can cause memory loss and lower the ability to
concentrate, as well as harm the reproductive system. Lead is also known to
cause high blood pressure, nerve disorders, and muscle and joint pain.
Researchers believe that Ludwig van Beethoven became ill and died from lead
poisoning. 





It is our belief that if we
slow down the number of lead acid batteries going to recycling plants or being
discarded in landfills we can slow down the number 2 cause of toxic pollution
around the world.  And the only way to do
this is to stop replacing batteries and start repairing them.
In the USA there are over
350 Million lead acid batteries in use right now.  Recycling plants are having trouble handling the
demand and are spilling poisons into our ground water.  Globally, 40% of discarded batteries are
being dumped in landfills. 
With OP1, 50% of these
batteries can be returned to the market and will last up to 3 years.  Local businesses can be opened to repair and
sell these batteries lowering unemployment, saving our children and the
environment and building hope.

<h3>How Charliehorse Was Born</h3>

<p>To speed up the market-entry process while the patent was being secured, international non-linked manufacturers were found for the individual parts. This meant safely having manufacturing secured and tested before the patent's completion.</p>

<h3>The Next Generation Satellite System</h3>
<p>The smartphone is our own personal computer that we always have by our side. What if it was able to do much more? This is where the Modular CubeSat comes in. A CubeSat is a small 10 x 10 x 11.35 cm cube satellite and their relatively low cost allows many researchers and students to launch satellites for research and education. They usually use consumer off of the shelf components (COTS) which contribute to their low costs but their development costs are still very prohibitive for some schools and we think that we can make the CubeSat even cheaper. </p>
<p>By basing the satellite off of the Moto Mods platform, anyone who is able to develop a Moto Mod or create an Android app will be able to develop an instrument for the satellite. This will allow researchers to focus more on the development of their research instruments, and allow consumers to build their own satellite with ease. We are projecting a cost of $5000 for the build cost of the satellite.</p>
<p>We are a multidisciplinary team of six students at the University of California, Irvine and are excited about creating the next form of satellite development. With your help we will be able to achieve our goal of building and launching proof of concept version of the Modular CubeSat.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488567414/pyzfrgme3jd4hitfz0jj.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Currently, we only have $600 in funds to complete the project and will be completing our first fully functional prototype within the next two weeks. This is only enough to build the first two prototypes! Although the satellite itself will cost $5000 in components there is still a lot more that needs to happen in the background. In order to achieve our goal of launching a proof of concept version of the satellite we will need your help.</p>
<p>Here is where the funding will go:</p>

</div></div>","The Next Generation Satellite System
The smartphone is our own personal computer that we always have by our side. What if it was able to do much more? This is where the Modular CubeSat comes in. A CubeSat is a small 10 x 10 x 11.35 cm cube satellite and their relatively low cost allows many researchers and students to launch satellites for research and education. They usually use consumer off of the shelf components (COTS) which contribute to their low costs but their development costs are still very prohibitive for some schools and we think that we can make the CubeSat even cheaper. 
By basing the satellite off of the Moto Mods platform, anyone who is able to develop a Moto Mod or create an Android app will be able to develop an instrument for the satellite. This will allow researchers to focus more on the development of their research instruments, and allow consumers to build their own satellite with ease. We are projecting a cost of $5000 for the build cost of the satellite.
We are a multidisciplinary team of six students at the University of California, Irvine and are excited about creating the next form of satellite development. With your help we will be able to achieve our goal of building and launching proof of concept version of the Modular CubeSat.


What We Need & What You Get
Currently, we only have $600 in funds to complete the project and will be completing our first fully functional prototype within the next two weeks. This is only enough to build the first two prototypes! Although the satellite itself will cost $5000 in components there is still a lot more that needs to happen in the background. In order to achieve our goal of launching a proof of concept version of the satellite we will need your help.
Here is where the funding will go:

Components: Even though most of the components can be bought off the shelf, some parts are still very cost prohibitive with our current budget.
Ground Station: What is the point of building a satellite if you can't hear back from it? We will be building a ground station that will be able to transmit and receive signals to and from the satellite.
Testing: High altitude balloon tests, Vibrational tests, Shock tests, Thermal Tests
More Testing
Even More Testing: The satellite has to be reliable!


We have some great perks for our backers!

Name on Website: Get your name on our project website
Polo Shirt: Receive a Polo shirt with the team logo!
Name on the Satellite: Have your name laser etched onto a component of the satellite!

If we are unable to reach our funding goal, the project will be unable to be ready to launch into space but we will still put in our effort into developing the satellite system as much as we can. We will then release our data to the public where hopefully someone else can complete the project.

The Impact
The Moto Mods Platform will allow:

Satellite development without having to design the whole satellite
A sub $5000 satellite
Allow anyone to develop their own satellite
Make space research more accessible to universities
Allow schools to easily teach about satellites and satellite development
Provide a surge in space related research

<p><b>Overview</b></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>OpenMandriva is a non-profit association, a fully independent organization that manages, governs and develops its own Linux Distribution, it’s roots are in the Mandrake-Mandriva community. We have been developing this operating system for two years. Our contributors are all volunteers, who believe and invest in the world of free software which aims to produce software which is free of any backdoors (spyware). Our legal headquarters are in France, but our contributors and members come from  30 countries from all around the world. </span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>We believe that our operating system should be free to the
user, adaptable and technically advanced but at the same time easy to use.</b></p>
<p><b>This comprehensive and modern
operating system is available for you to install and use right now, feel what
free feels and feel free to download OpenMandriva Lx 2014.1 from</b></p>

<p><span>If it is here, why are we running a campaign?  Our next release is scheduled for May 2015 and we need your help to support and further improve this high quality product. </span></p>
<p>The last two releases were downloaded dozens thousands times and the reviews we have been getting have encouraged us to continue. See for yourself!</p>
<p><b><i>Jesse Smith, Distrowatch says: </i></b>“The operating system (OpenMandriva Lx 2014.1) is stable and the interface looks friendly. For the most part, the distribution worked very well for me. OpenMandriva has a sense of polish and friendliness about it which is hard to qualify, but is certainly there. The system installer, the Control Centre and the pretty (yet traditional) desktop environment all appear to be designed to be as newcomer friendly as possible. I was especially impressed by the systemd front end. &lt;...&gt; OpenMandriva did a beautiful job of smoothing over the details of systemd while presenting a functional front end. </p>
<p>&lt;..&gt; OpenMandriva 2014.1 is one of the best efforts I have seen to date to take back the “beginner friendly” crown. This distribution was easy to set up, easy to use, has a great control centre and should appeal to both novice users and power users alike. I was happy and a bit impressed with OpenMandriva 2014.1 and I recommend giving it a try.” </p>

OpenMandriva is a non-profit association, a fully independent organization that manages, governs and develops its own Linux Distribution, it’s roots are in the Mandrake-Mandriva community. We have been developing this operating system for two years. Our contributors are all volunteers, who believe and invest in the world of free software which aims to produce software which is free of any backdoors (spyware). Our legal headquarters are in France, but our contributors and members come from  30 countries from all around the world. 


We believe that our operating system should be free to the
user, adaptable and technically advanced but at the same time easy to use.
This comprehensive and modern
operating system is available for you to install and use right now, feel what
free feels and feel free to download OpenMandriva Lx 2014.1 from
http://openmandriva.org/



If it is here, why are we running a campaign?  Our next release is scheduled for May 2015 and we need your help to support and further improve this high quality product. 
The last two releases were downloaded dozens thousands times and the reviews we have been getting have encouraged us to continue. See for yourself!
Jesse Smith, Distrowatch says: “The operating system (OpenMandriva Lx 2014.1) is stable and the interface looks friendly. For the most part, the distribution worked very well for me. OpenMandriva has a sense of polish and friendliness about it which is hard to qualify, but is certainly there. The system installer, the Control Centre and the pretty (yet traditional) desktop environment all appear to be designed to be as newcomer friendly as possible. I was especially impressed by the systemd front end. <...> OpenMandriva did a beautiful job of smoothing over the details of systemd while presenting a functional front end. 
<..> OpenMandriva 2014.1 is one of the best efforts I have seen to date to take back the “beginner friendly” crown. This distribution was easy to set up, easy to use, has a great control centre and should appeal to both novice users and power users alike. I was happy and a bit impressed with OpenMandriva 2014.1 and I recommend giving it a try.”
