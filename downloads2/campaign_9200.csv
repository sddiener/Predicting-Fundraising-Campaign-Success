<h2><strong>What is this New Mobile App Entertainment Network?</strong></h2>
<p>This NEW &amp; INNOVATIVE App Entertainment Network will bring positive programming to over 5.6 billion users cell phones and mobile devices worldwide. </p>
<p>Similar to a traditional television network yet instead for mobile devices worldwide, this network will feature shows, music, books, magazines and games.</p>
<p>Initial funding will begin at $1,000 then as Amar releases this news via press conference at The W Hotel in Hollywood, funding will step up to $8,000, $20,000, $300,000 and beyond $1,000,000 by 2013.         </p>
<p>This network is a collective.  Each donation will count as a Production credit and donators will be listed with SAG-AFTRA One Union. <a href=""http://www.sagaftra.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">sagaftra.org</a>.  Listing will include: Associate Producer, Producer and Executive Producer. </p>

<h3>Short Summary:</h3>
<p>I'm Halsey Berryman, a junior Fine Arts undergraduate student at the Corcoran College of Art + Design in Washington, DC. Our small but diverse student body consists of artists who work across multiple disciplines, including sculpture, painting, drawing, multi-media, and performance. After working hard all year, twenty-four of my classmates and I have been selected to participate in a group show at the Brera Academy, located in Milan, Italy. </p>
<p>Here's the problem: being such a small institution, we don't have the funds to support the shipping costs of safely transporting these works overseas.</p>
<p>The exhibition is a huge opportunity for all of us. For many of us, this is the first major show we will have been in, let alone internationally. Not only that, but the works included in this show have a chance of being entered into the Milan Expo of 2015. </p>
<p>Students from the Brera Academy in Milan will be sending works to be exhibited in the Corcoran's own Gallery 31 in return. This is the first time the Corcoran has had the opportunity to exchange works with such an internationally reputable institution.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>As of right now, we need $2500 to cover the rest of the shipping costs not funded by our institution. This would cover the boxes, insulation, and other safety precautions we would need to ship the works safely. Given the diversity of our selected students, some works will be more expensive to ship than others. </p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, all the funds from this campaign will go to shipping costs, regardless. We are confident that we can make this happen, but we need your help!</p>

We're less than two weeks to the end of the Tarot of Bones Spring 2016 IndieGoGo Campaign, and there's still almost $2,000 to go to hi the fundraising goal! Remember that if we don't achieve the $5,000 mark, IndieGoGo will take a much larger percentage of the final amount, in addition to what Paypal takes, which means significantly less funding to defray printing and other costs.

The Tarot of Bones will still be released this year, but to help sweeten the pot a bit I'm announcing a stretch goal: if we achieve the $5,000 mark by the end of the campaign on April 30, I'll offer an online tutorial on how to use the Tarot of Bones exclusively for backers of the campaign. I already have one for those who backed the first campaign, so this will be a separate class at a different time. Those who are unable to make it to the class will get the video emailed to them. (And, of course, email advice is free!)

Sound good? You can back the campaign here!

<p></p><p></p><h3><br/></h3><h3>The Bones Are In Place; Let's Bring Them Home!</h3><p>I'm Lupa, an artist, author and amateur naturalist in Portland, OR.; <a href=""http://www.thegreenwolf.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">you can find out more about my works at my primary website</a>. The Tarot of Bones is my biggest art and writing project yet: 78 assemblage pieces, one for each of the cards of the tarot, which will be photographed for a deck and book set to be released this summer. <a href=""http://www.thetarotofbones.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">You can get more information about the Tarot of Bones on the official website.</a></p><p>I began this project in January 2015; since its inception, here's what I've accomplished:</p><ul>
<li>I created <a href=""www.thetarotofbones.com/the-cards"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.thetarotofbones.com/the-cards"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">all 78 permanent assemblage pieces,</a> plus a 79th for the Happy Squirrel card, before my deadline of December 31, 2015.</li>
<li>I wrote the manuscript for the Tarot of Bones book, and delivered it to an independent editor for editing on December 31, 2015. I am now working on revising the manuscript using the edits I received.</li>
<li>I ran a highly successful IndieGoGo campaign to raise the funds needed to cover the substantial materials costs for the assemblages, among other expenses associated with this project.</li>
<li>I created a solid promotional campaign for the Tarot of Bones, to include multiple podcast, blog and other media interviews, social media networking, promotional postcards, and grassroots support throughout several communities relevant to this project.</li>
<li>I stayed within my production schedule with minimal alterations, and am still on course for a Summer 2016 release</li>
</ul><p>Now I'm giving you a second opportunity to support the completion of the Tarot of Bones with the 2016 Campaign.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456440625/xerlhgunjsizcts7vlfe.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><h3>Why a Second Campaign?</h3><p>Even though the first campaign ran for 45 days, I had a LOT of people tell me they missed out on the opportunity to back it, either because they didn't have the money at the time or didn't find out about it until later. This second campaign offers them a chance to pitch in and get the deck and book at a reduced rate (though not as low as in the first campaign). </p><p>The initial Tarot of Bones IndieGoGo campaign raised a little over twice its $5,000 fundraising goal, an incredible outcome! After IndieGoGo and Paypal each took out their fees, I was able to:</p><p></p><ul>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Pay for the thousands of dollars of bones and other materials necessary to create the assemblages, <a href=""www.thetarotofbones.com/the-cards"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">which you can see on the Tarot of Bones website here</a></span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Order copies of my other books and other items that were selected as perks by campaign supporters</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Print professional quality flyers and other promotional materials</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Reserve funds to pay a professional editor for the Tarot of Bones companion book</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Cover other administrative costs</span><br/>
</li>
</ul><p>I still have some of the funding left, and it will help defray remaining costs like shipping out the perks from the first campaign once the deck and book are out, but there are still significant outlays of money ahead including (but not limited to):</p><ul>
<li>Printing an initial run of 2000 Tarot of Bones decks</li>
<li>Printing the 250+ preordered copies of the Tarot of Bones book through CreateSpace, plus those preordered during this IndieGoGo campaign</li>
<li>Shipping the decks and books from the printers to my home</li>
</ul><div>And that's not including the fulfillment of perks for this campaign, official release parties to display the original assemblages before they're shipped to their new homes or put up for sale, and numerous other associated costs. <p></p>
<p>$5,000 is not enough to cover all the above expenses, but it will make a healthy dent in them. The IndieGoGo campaigns are not the only source of funding for the project; I am putting a significant amount of my own money into the pot, no small feat given that I am 100% self-employed and the financial backbone of my household. I am not taking any of the IndieGoGo money for personal expenses like rent and bills, and putting hundreds of as-of-yet unpaid hours into the Tarot of Bones, so every dollar raised in this campaign helps ease the financial stress on my household.</p>
</div><p></p><h3>What Do You Get For Your Contribution?</h3><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><b>This time around, you can select perk packages that don't necessarily include the deck and book--this is so folks who supported the first campaign (and thereby reserved the deck and book already) can pick out even more goodies if they like.</b> </span><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">If you want to get more than one perk package you'll need to make separate contributions</b><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">, but nothing's stopping you from doing just that!</span><br/></p><p>So what sorts of goodies can you get by backing this campaign? Here are a few possibilities for you to choose from:</p><ul>
<li>
<b>The Tarot of Bones Deck</b> (with the companion paperback or ebook)</li>
<li>
<b>Prints of select cards</b>, approximately 8"" x 10"" in size</li>
<li>
<b>A hand-sewn (by me!) leather bag</b> to keep your deck in</li>
<li>
<b>Original assemblage pieces</b> used in the making of the Tarot of Bones</li>
<li>
<b>Jewelry made from the jaws of skulls </b>used in Tarot of Bones assemblages</li>
<li>
<b>T-shirts featuring art</b> from the Tarot of Bones deck</li>
<li>
<b>Copies of my other books</b>, your choice of which one(s)</li>
<li>
<b>A ten-card reading by me</b> once I have my own copy of the Tarot of Bones</li>
<li>

<h3>$howing You the Money</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, after IndieGoGo and Paypal each took out their portion in fees, the money from the 2015 IndieGoGo campaign paid for a lot of substantial costs, to include the remaining materials for creating 79 assemblages (78 tarot cards plus the Happy Squirrel), packing materials, hiring a professional editor for the Tarot of Bones book, and other associated costs. The remaining money has been set aside to help with future costs, to include printing and shipping. </p>
<p>This is a flexible-funding campaign, which means that if I do not meet my goal, I still get the money (but IndieGoGo gets to keep a much larger percentage of it, 9% as opposed to 4%, not including Paypal's fees on top of that). <b>Even if I don't raise $5,000, I will continue with the project with the goal of having the deck and book released Summer 2016</b>; the successful completion of this campaign will make that much easier. </p>
<p>While the majority of costs will go to the production of the set, <b>I will be donating a to-be-decided portion of the proceeds to nonprofit organizations that benefit wildlife and their habitats. </b>I am already a regular contributor to several of these organizations, including making monthly donations to a select few. While the exact amount I give varies from month to month depending on my income and expenses, I do what I can to help these organizations keep up their good work. </p>

You can see my up-to-date production schedule at <a href=""www.thetarotofbones.com/production-schedule"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.thetarotofbones.com/production-schedule</a>/ - so far I've managed to complete my tasks on schedule. The only major change since I started the Tarot of Bones project at the start of 2015 is that I have chosen to outsource the photography because, quite frankly, my photography skills aren't up to snuff. This has meant a small potential delay in production, but I am already negotiating with a photographer and once I have the photos on my hard drive I can get them ready for the printer. </div>
<div>As I have maintained all along, it is not a matter of if the Tarot of Bones is happening, but when. The only big risk I see is a delayed release due to production and/or fundraising taking longer than anticipated. However, I am at least as eager as the rest of you to see this come to fruition, and with as much as I've already invested in it, I'm dedicated to seeing it through. </div>

<h3>Why Is This Project Important?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The Tarot of Bones is born out of a creative career spanning nearly two decades, embracing both writing and art, and challenging me to excellence not only in familiar media but in new skills as well. At the end of it, I will be able to offer others a valuable tool in divination as well as a beautiful work of art. </p>Moreover, it's a reminder that we are still a part of the natural world. I chose bones as the primary material for this project because throughout the entirety of the body of a vertebrate animal–human included–the bones are the strongest portions. They provide a scaffolding on which the rest of the animal is built, and they remain long after flesh and sinew have gone away. Likewise, although generations of people come and go, the desire to connect to something greater than one’s self and to engage one’s intuition endures. Through bones we can speak with our evolutionary ancestors; through divination we create patterns that help us make sense of the world around us–and the worlds within.<p></p>
<p>Finally, whether you're able to back this campaign or not, <b>please help spread the word! </b>Use the share tools that IndieGoGo provides. Post a link on Facebook, Tumblr, Twitter and elsewhere. Email people you think would be interested. Contact alternative, art and other media sources who may be interested in covering what I'm working on here (I have a press release available if you need it!) <b>The more people who know about this campaign, the merrier--and the stronger the Tarot of Bones will be!</b></p>

</div></div>","Update, 4-18-16: Hey, folks! We're less than two weeks to the end of the Tarot of Bones Spring 2016 IndieGoGo Campaign, and there's still almost $2,000 to go to hi the fundraising goal! Remember that if we don't achieve the $5,000 mark, IndieGoGo will take a much larger percentage of the final amount, in addition to what Paypal takes, which means significantly less funding to defray printing and other costs.

The Tarot of Bones will still be released this year, but to help sweeten the pot a bit I'm announcing a stretch goal: if we achieve the $5,000 mark by the end of the campaign on April 30, I'll offer an online tutorial on how to use the Tarot of Bones exclusively for backers of the campaign. I already have one for those who backed the first campaign, so this will be a separate class at a different time. Those who are unable to make it to the class will get the video emailed to them. (And, of course, email advice is free!)

Sound good? You can back the campaign here!

The Bones Are In Place; Let's Bring Them Home!I'm Lupa, an artist, author and amateur naturalist in Portland, OR.; you can find out more about my works at my primary website. The Tarot of Bones is my biggest art and writing project yet: 78 assemblage pieces, one for each of the cards of the tarot, which will be photographed for a deck and book set to be released this summer. You can get more information about the Tarot of Bones on the official website.I began this project in January 2015; since its inception, here's what I've accomplished:
I created all 78 permanent assemblage pieces, plus a 79th for the Happy Squirrel card, before my deadline of December 31, 2015.
I wrote the manuscript for the Tarot of Bones book, and delivered it to an independent editor for editing on December 31, 2015. I am now working on revising the manuscript using the edits I received.
I ran a highly successful IndieGoGo campaign to raise the funds needed to cover the substantial materials costs for the assemblages, among other expenses associated with this project.
I created a solid promotional campaign for the Tarot of Bones, to include multiple podcast, blog and other media interviews, social media networking, promotional postcards, and grassroots support throughout several communities relevant to this project.
I stayed within my production schedule with minimal alterations, and am still on course for a Summer 2016 release
Now I'm giving you a second opportunity to support the completion of the Tarot of Bones with the 2016 Campaign.Why a Second Campaign?Even though the first campaign ran for 45 days, I had a LOT of people tell me they missed out on the opportunity to back it, either because they didn't have the money at the time or didn't find out about it until later. This second campaign offers them a chance to pitch in and get the deck and book at a reduced rate (though not as low as in the first campaign). The initial Tarot of Bones IndieGoGo campaign raised a little over twice its $5,000 fundraising goal, an incredible outcome! After IndieGoGo and Paypal each took out their fees, I was able to:

Pay for the thousands of dollars of bones and other materials necessary to create the assemblages, which you can see on the Tarot of Bones website here


Order copies of my other books and other items that were selected as perks by campaign supporters


Print professional quality flyers and other promotional materials


Reserve funds to pay a professional editor for the Tarot of Bones companion book


Cover other administrative costs

I still have some of the funding left, and it will help defray remaining costs like shipping out the perks from the first campaign once the deck and book are out, but there are still significant outlays of money ahead including (but not limited to):
Printing an initial run of 2000 Tarot of Bones decks
Printing the 250+ preordered copies of the Tarot of Bones book through CreateSpace, plus those preordered during this IndieGoGo campaign
Shipping the decks and books from the printers to my home
And that's not including the fulfillment of perks for this campaign, official release parties to display the original assemblages before they're shipped to their new homes or put up for sale, and numerous other associated costs. 
$5,000 is not enough to cover all the above expenses, but it will make a healthy dent in them. The IndieGoGo campaigns are not the only source of funding for the project; I am putting a significant amount of my own money into the pot, no small feat given that I am 100% self-employed and the financial backbone of my household. I am not taking any of the IndieGoGo money for personal expenses like rent and bills, and putting hundreds of as-of-yet unpaid hours into the Tarot of Bones, so every dollar raised in this campaign helps ease the financial stress on my household.
What Do You Get For Your Contribution?This time around, you can select perk packages that don't necessarily include the deck and book--this is so folks who supported the first campaign (and thereby reserved the deck and book already) can pick out even more goodies if they like. If you want to get more than one perk package you'll need to make separate contributions, but nothing's stopping you from doing just that!So what sorts of goodies can you get by backing this campaign? Here are a few possibilities for you to choose from:

The Tarot of Bones Deck (with the companion paperback or ebook)

Prints of select cards, approximately 8"" x 10"" in size

A hand-sewn (by me!) leather bag to keep your deck in

Original assemblage pieces used in the making of the Tarot of Bones

Jewelry made from the jaws of skulls used in Tarot of Bones assemblages

T-shirts featuring art from the Tarot of Bones deck

Copies of my other books, your choice of which one(s)

A ten-card reading by me once I have my own copy of the Tarot of Bones

A special thank you in the Tarot of Bones companion book and on the official website
If you can't decide which one you reallllly want, keep in mind you can claim multiple perks by making multiple contributions.Also, please remember that perk amounts include my costs for materials for fulfilling and shipping them, and also account for IndieGoGo and Paypal taking out their fees!Now for a little more detail on some of these perks:The Tarot of Bones Deck and Book: This is the primary reason for all this effort! You can choose from the deck alone, or the book and deck together. They are offered at a discount (though not quite as big a discount as in the first campaign, especially considering IndieGoGo now allows shipping to be added in). A great deal, and a great way to help me raise the funds to get the printing done!Shirts: I'll be printing up t-shirts featuring the final photograph (without text) for the Magician card; the photo above just shows a prototype using my photo to test the print quality (looks even better in person!) The t-shirt perk is offered as a standalone, no cards or book included (you can always make another contribution if you want the deck and book!)Prints: I'll be making prints of three NEW pieces! In the last campaign I offered the Ace of Pentacles, the Magician and Judgment. This time around you have your choice of the Empress (shown between the first and second sections of this page), the Two of Pentacles (at the top of this paragraph) and the Hierophant (at the beginning of Timeline, Risks and Challenges).
Leather Pouch: Leather pouches were one of the first projects I learned to make when I initially started working with hides and bones. You can choose to claim a deck with a leather pouch made just the right size for it. US folks will get one made of deerskin; international folks will get cowhide due to customs restrictions. Pouches will be shipped when the decks are shipped in Summer 2016.Original Tarot of Bones Assemblage Piece: There are three different options for people in the U.S. who want to buy one of the original assemblage pieces used in making the Tarot of Bones. There is an additional option for international buyers to get one of a very limited number of the assemblage pieces that do not include wildlife or plant parts and can therefore be sent out of the U.S. While I will ultimately choose who gets which piece, you are welcome to contact me with your five favorites (you can see all the assemblages at www.thetarotofbones.com/the-cards). Also, as I will be displaying some of these originals at galleries and other art venues in the latter half of 2016, they will not be delivered to their new homes until sometime in 2017. (You will get your deck and book set plus any other perks in Summer 2016.)




Books: I've written and published several books prior to this project. You can choose to bring home one or more of these titles, shipped along with your Tarot of Bones set in Summer 2016:


Fang and Fur, Blood and Bone: A Primal Guide to Animal Magic
DIY Totemism: Your Personal Guide to Animal Totems

Limited Edition Jawbone Jewelry: I have a very small number of jawbones left over from skulls that were used in the creation of the Tarot of Bones assemblages. You can choose one of these exclusive pieces--made custom just for you--as a standalone perk (if you want the deck and book you'll need to make a separate contribution.)

<p>The lease on the building expires on Feb. 1, and we are raising funds for closing costs and a down payment to maintain occupancy of the space, continue Red Curtain's ongoing community impact, and expand our efforts to create a true center for the arts.  </p>
<p>The Red Curtain Foundation for the Arts was founded by a group of local arts supporters and educators in 2009 as a non-profit arts education and production organization. We came together with the goal of bringing artistic experiences to underserved communities, especially nearby areas hit hardest by the recession. We were passionate about keeping the arts affordable, and ensuring that people from all walks of life would have the opportunity to participate as artists, students and audience members.</p>
<p>In 2013, our operations moved into a one-time lumber store in Marysville, Washington. This location was chosen because its size will allow the organization to grow, the layout works well for an arts center and performance space, and it is located in the heart of this growing town. But, mostly, we moved into the space because Marysville, with a population of nearly 65,000 residents, had no existing arts center or even an adequate community meeting space.</p>

<p><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>Over the past 18 months, our all-volunteer staff has worked tirelessly raising funds to bring the structure up to current building codes. These efforts paid off, and the Red Curtain Arts Center officially opened its doors in April of 2014. We immediately began offering classes, producing plays, and making the space available for renters and other community groups.</span></p>

<p><i>Marysville's mayor, city council members and RCF volunteers celebrated the official ribbon-cutting in April 2014.</i></p>
<p></p>
<p>But last month we were informed by the property owners that our lease agreement will expire at the end of January of 2015, and it will not be renewed. We have an immediate need to raise the funds necessary to close on the purchase of the property, or this small community will lose its only arts facility. </p>
<p>While we recognize that a goal of $50,000 is a challenge, we are focused on garnering support from 1,000 people who can contribute just $50 each.</p>
<p>The property, 1.5 acres of prime commercial real estate, has been appraised at $2.6 million, but Red Curtain has negotiated a purchase price of just $1 million, to be paid over 10 years. The total amount needed for the down payment and closing costs is approximately $120,000. Through partnerships and connections we've developed within Marysville, with the Tulalip Tribes and individual donors, we have potential commitments for as much as $70,000 towards our goal. Now we find ourselves reaching out to the community, and taking a grassroots approach to fund the balance.</p> </div> <div> <h3>An Achievable Goal</h3> <p>Last year at this time we ran our first crowd funding campaign on Indiegogo to fund the installation of a fire monitoring system, and to make necessary safety and ADA-required upgrades to the arts center. That work was completed last April, thanks to broad community support and the donations raised from that initial campaign. Since then, our classes, programming and ongoing donations have helped us cover the operating expenses of about $3,500 per month, but have not allowed us to make significant progress towards purchasing the property. </p>
<p>Your contribution to this new campaign will allow us to keep operating in Marysville, a community that has enthusiastically welcomed us. More than this, having the property listed in Red Curtain's name will allow the organization to pursue other options which were not available to us as a renter, including the ability to receive a property tax waiver (saving approximately $24,000 per year).</p>
<p>Finding one thousand people who share our passion for invigorating the community through the arts seems like an attainable goal. However, if we aren't able to fulfill our financial obligations, funds raised through this campaign will instead be used to cover transportation fees and storage costs for all of Red Curtain's lighting and sound equipment, set pieces and costumes...but we don't want to think about that outcome.</p>

<blockquote>When creative activity is happening in large and small ways throughout an area, it creates surprising ripple effects of benefits, even for those who don't participate directly.

access to a facility devoted to the local arts community. The Marysville
City Bands, Northern Sound Choirs, Marysville Arts Coalition, the Public Servants and Final

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497554685/laytlbblf1i9rhirpt54.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We are an artist team ~ Kasia Polkowska and Kyle Cunniff.  We met 14 years ago while studying art at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York.  Currently we live in Alamosa, Colorado. We work in various media from glass, to painting, to sculpture and more!  We love to make beautiful, colorful art to share with the people around us. </p>
<h3>Help Support Our First Community Mural Project!</h3>
<p>Alamosa, like most rural towns, has seen lack luster growth over the years due to the big box stores taking business from its historic downtown, despite being only 30 minutes from the Sand Dunes National Park. This year Artscape, a sculpture program was launched to drive more tourism into downtown. We hope to keep this excitement and momentum going by adding our mural project to Main Street.  Below you can see one of our community groups working to help us make this mural a reality!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497555468/lsdbti9fdfxni5esw7n9.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>Kasia created the Lotus Flower Design for the project.</li>
<li>Kyle created engineering drawings to submit to the Colorado Historical Foundation and was granted approval to display artwork on The Center for Restorative Programs building.</li>
<li>Through Colorado Creative Industries, Jeff Owlsey, Small Business Director here in Alamosa, has already been able to secure a $500 grant in funding to cover a portion of the project.  He has also been helping us recruit volunteers via his Social Ops Group.</li>
<li>Luke Yoder, director at The Center for Restorative Programs has organized groups of volunteers to work on the project.</li>
<li>Kasia and Kyle are hosting volunteers in their studio, teaching them a new craft while everyone makes a section to contribute to the final mural.</li>
<li>Kasia and Kyle are providing refreshments for the volunteers including homebred goods by Kyle =)</li>
<li>Kasia and Kyle will also work to create various sections of the mural and will glue, grout and install the completed project.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We want to bring more beauty and color into Alamosa.  When community members see beauty all around them its inspiring and it makes a difference in their quality of life. It can also help to bring folks from all over to come experience our historic town and to help with the growth of our Main Street.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497556197/lcozmuqe1e9fw4ddqrqe.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>We want to bring more public art and community art projects to smaller, rural communities in Colorado.</li>
<li>This is a great opportunity for us to share our unique talents and skills with our community members for whom this is a rare chance to take part in a free, educational and rewarding artistic event. </li>
</ul>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We need your help to fund the additional costs of materials for this truly unique public art project.  Below is the break down of the expenses we've incurred thus far, not including travel time/cost to acquire materials (we drove 4 hours to Denver to get many of our supplies), the refreshments for our volunteers, the actual time we've dedicated to this project, the costs associated with using our studio and the cost of the fees for running the campaign.  The $1,500 that we've outlined below is just the materials cost for creating the mural.  </p>
<ul>
<li>$465 -   a custom, removable steel frame (in order to be in line with the guidelines set up by the historical society)</li>
<li>$250 -   2 sheets of 4ft x 8 ft Wedi boards (Kyle will create a weather proof substrate with these)</li>
<li>$50   -    exterior red wood 2""x4""x8' boards (to be used for the substrate construction)</li>
<li>$10    -   construction adhesive for wood backing</li>
<li>$65   -    tamper proof bolts (for installing the framed mosaic onto the building)</li>
<li>$50   -    pattern printouts (for templates for volunteers to use as well as for constructing the mural)</li>
<li>$250 -   36 square feet of colored stained glass</li>
<li>$135  -   Latapoxy 300 an exterior epoxy adhesive</li>
<li>$92    -   Spectralock Pro Premium an exterior epoxy grout</li>
<li>$25    -   miscellaneous items such as tape, markers, gloves, rags, screws</li>
<li>$50    -   mural project plaque</li>
<li>$100  -   a second plaque for honor the potential high donors from this campaign to be placed next to the mural</li>
</ul>
<p>Total Cost of Mural Materials:  $1,442</p>
<p>Total Cost of Mural Materials if we get the second plaque:  $1,542</p>
<h3>The Perks</h3>
<p>We tried to keep it pretty simple but we still feel that we've got some great options for our supporters.  <i>Note: If you do not want a perk, there is a special option to donate without claiming a reward.  </i>All donors will be listed on the Kasia Mosaics Website on the project page, unless they'd like to keep their name private.</p>
<p>Our simplest perk is Gratitude ~ we hope that many folks will donate $5 just because they believe in the power of art!  </p>

</div></div>","Who We Are

We are an artist team ~ Kasia Polkowska and Kyle Cunniff.  We met 14 years ago while studying art at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York.  Currently we live in Alamosa, Colorado. We work in various media from glass, to painting, to sculpture and more!  We love to make beautiful, colorful art to share with the people around us. 
Help Support Our First Community Mural Project!
Alamosa, like most rural towns, has seen lack luster growth over the years due to the big box stores taking business from its historic downtown, despite being only 30 minutes from the Sand Dunes National Park. This year Artscape, a sculpture program was launched to drive more tourism into downtown. We hope to keep this excitement and momentum going by adding our mural project to Main Street.  Below you can see one of our community groups working to help us make this mural a reality!


Kasia created the Lotus Flower Design for the project.
Kyle created engineering drawings to submit to the Colorado Historical Foundation and was granted approval to display artwork on The Center for Restorative Programs building.
Through Colorado Creative Industries, Jeff Owlsey, Small Business Director here in Alamosa, has already been able to secure a $500 grant in funding to cover a portion of the project.  He has also been helping us recruit volunteers via his Social Ops Group.
Luke Yoder, director at The Center for Restorative Programs has organized groups of volunteers to work on the project.
Kasia and Kyle are hosting volunteers in their studio, teaching them a new craft while everyone makes a section to contribute to the final mural.
Kasia and Kyle are providing refreshments for the volunteers including homebred goods by Kyle =)
Kasia and Kyle will also work to create various sections of the mural and will glue, grout and install the completed project.


The Impact
We want to bring more beauty and color into Alamosa.  When community members see beauty all around them its inspiring and it makes a difference in their quality of life. It can also help to bring folks from all over to come experience our historic town and to help with the growth of our Main Street.


We want to bring more public art and community art projects to smaller, rural communities in Colorado.
This is a great opportunity for us to share our unique talents and skills with our community members for whom this is a rare chance to take part in a free, educational and rewarding artistic event. 

What We Need
We need your help to fund the additional costs of materials for this truly unique public art project.  Below is the break down of the expenses we've incurred thus far, not including travel time/cost to acquire materials (we drove 4 hours to Denver to get many of our supplies), the refreshments for our volunteers, the actual time we've dedicated to this project, the costs associated with using our studio and the cost of the fees for running the campaign.  The $1,500 that we've outlined below is just the materials cost for creating the mural.  

$465 -   a custom, removable steel frame (in order to be in line with the guidelines set up by the historical society)
$250 -   2 sheets of 4ft x 8 ft Wedi boards (Kyle will create a weather proof substrate with these)
$50   -    exterior red wood 2""x4""x8' boards (to be used for the substrate construction)
$10    -   construction adhesive for wood backing
$65   -    tamper proof bolts (for installing the framed mosaic onto the building)
$50   -    pattern printouts (for templates for volunteers to use as well as for constructing the mural)
$250 -   36 square feet of colored stained glass
$135  -   Latapoxy 300 an exterior epoxy adhesive
$92    -   Spectralock Pro Premium an exterior epoxy grout
$25    -   miscellaneous items such as tape, markers, gloves, rags, screws
$50    -   mural project plaque
$100  -   a second plaque for honor the potential high donors from this campaign to be placed next to the mural

Total Cost of Mural Materials:  $1,442
Total Cost of Mural Materials if we get the second plaque:  $1,542
The Perks
We tried to keep it pretty simple but we still feel that we've got some great options for our supporters.  Note: If you do not want a perk, there is a special option to donate without claiming a reward.  All donors will be listed on the Kasia Mosaics Website on the project page, unless they'd like to keep their name private.
Our simplest perk is Gratitude ~ we hope that many folks will donate $5 just because they believe in the power of art!  
We'll professionally photograph the completed mural and use the imagery to create thank you cards as well as signed poster prints.  We always strive for the highest quality products so these will be a great choice for those who can donate just a little bit more.
We know that there are many mosaic enthusiasts out there, trying to learn this unique art form so we have a special perk just for them.  Through our campaign, you can save $5 on the popular flower templates from the Kasia Mosaics Online Flower Class.  Below are examples of the flowers you can make using the 12 designs - the possibilities are endless!  Not for commercial use.

<p>Par la poésie, bousculer, questionner et vivre.
Voilà la mission du collectif de poésie de la relève Exond&amp;. Cette année,
le collectif s’attaque à l’angoisse existentielle et la peur avec sa <b>performance poétique</b> Unheimlich. Le
monde contemporain carbure aux apparences de bonheur. Mais quels démons se
cachent sous ce besoin suraffirmé de plaisir? Quelles sont ces noirceurs
(anodines ou viscérales) qui affligent nos actions, notre vie, voire notre
siècle? Qu’y a-t-il à fuir et à embrasser dans ces moments où l’univers nous
écrase?</p>
<p>Unheimlich, c'est l'écriture poétique de six artistes
qui livrent leurs perceptions de l’angoisse, dans une mise en scène qui mêle la
performance, la poésie, le mouvement et le théâtre.</p>
<p><i>Unheimlich
sera présenté le 10 mars 2016 au Studio P.</i></p>
<h2><b>D'où vient l'idée?</b></h2>
<p>Les six membres d'Exond&amp; ont
toujours eu la passion de la poésie et de la performance. Pour Unheimlich,
l'idée d'explorer le thème de l’angoisse s'est imposée en regardant notre
société et ses enjeux. L’angoisse est sur le point de devenir le nouveau mal du
siècle, et pourtant on n’en parle qu’à mots couverts. Nos poitrines serrées, en
baromètres de notre environnement social, cherchent, malgré nous, à nous faire
comprendre quelque chose qui nous est inconnu et difficile à appréhender.
Serait-ce que le poids des apparences devient trop lourd à porter? Que nous
nous éloignons trop des réalités du monde?  Résonnons-nous avec quelque chose de plus profond
que nous redoutons de comprendre? Par la poésie, Exond&amp; explorera les peurs
que chacun porte pour pousser la réflexion sur ce que ces cordes sensibles nous
chantent.</p>
<h2><b>Qu'est-ce qui prouve qu'on peut y
arriver?</b></h2>
<p>Le projet Unheimlich est le troisième projet
d'Exond&amp;. L'an dernier, le collectif a présenté, à guichet fermé, NORMPORN,
spectacle poétique sur les marginalités sexuelles. En 2014, Exond&amp; a monté
un spectacle dans le noir au Morrin Center, Le Déjectoire, où colère et perversion
s'imbriquaient pour interroger ce que chacun cache dans l'ombre. La présence du
collectif sur Indiegogo vise surtout à combler les besoins financiers du
projet.</p>

<h2><b>Pourquoi nous encourager?</b></h2>
<p>En interrogeant l’intériorité
secrète de chacun, en s'attaquant au sujet délicat de l’angoisse et de la peur,
et en repoussant les frontières du récital poétique et de la performance, Unheimlich
s'impose comme une initiative artistique unique et audacieuse. La réalisation
de ce nouveau projet d'Exond&amp; contribuera à montrer l'originalité et la
témérité artistique de la relève littéraire de Québec.</p>
<h2><b>Ce qu'on va faire avec les sous?</b></h2>
<p>Les sous demandés pour Unheimlich
permettront de garantir une performance plus poignante et impressionnante.
Ceux-ci iront directement dans le paiement des cachets du metteur en scène et
du concepteur sonore, ainsi que dans la location et l'achat d'équipements pour
la performance : costumes, éclairages spéciaux.</p>
<h2><b>Qui sont les gens déjà impliqués
dans le projet?</b></h2>
<p>Unheimlich, ce sera non seulement
une expérience littéraire et poétique, mais également une performance en lumière
et en mouvement. Pour nous venir en aide, le concepteur sonore Frédéric Dufour
et le metteur en scène Guillaume Pepin se sont joints aux membres du collectif.
Avec leur expérience, ils permettront aux ambitions artistiques de Unheimlich
de se réaliser.</p>
<h2><b>Que faire avec les sous si on
dépasse le montant?</b></h2>
<p>Tout surplus amassé grâce à votre
générosité permettra à Unheimlich de payer plus décemment son concepteur
sonore, son metteur en scène, son photographe et sa vidéaste (qui aident notre
projet par amour de l'art plus que par bénéfice personnel), ira dans l'achat de
plus d'équipement pour le spectacle et alimentera un fond pour produire les
productions futures du collectif.</p>

coeur?</b></h2>
<p>Unheimlich, c’est toucher à des

le jardin plus que secret, le stress et ses impacts, ainsi que la maladie

qui est normal, se débarrasser des apparences ne serait-ce que le temps d’un
spectacle et montrer à tous ce dont ils ont l’air une fois mis à nus :
vulnérables, humains, petits, et pourtant plus près de l’universel que jamais. En

Listen to an excerpt above
This composition is a musical account of every officially recorded nuclear explosion detonated between 1945 and the present day:

Each different instrument represents a country that partook
Each month in history lasts a second on the record
Each note played depicts a single bomb

The 8 musicians who contributed to this work are: Terry Edwards, Marion Andrau, Dan Cundy, Tom Savage, Graham Brittain, Anne-Marie Watson, Lucy Woodhouse and Sarita Jepps. They range from world renowned musicians to my housemates at the time (no offence Reets)

I originally made this audio art work in 2013 and I update it, alongside history, everytime it is shown in an exhibition.
This record will make you realise the magnitude of the nuclear testing program, around our planet, with over 2000 explosions - the audio lasts over 14 minutes.
I'm really grateful for your support in making this happen!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Lynde Mendoza.  I am trying to raise money to help pay for the funeral of my Brother (Charles Burleson), and the funeral of my Sister-in-law (Tammy Burleson).  They both died within 3 days of each other.  My Sister-in-law died on June 26th of a horrible asthma attack.  Then on June 29th my Brother was found dead in his bed.  They had one daughter, Tiffany..25 years old.  They also had one Grandson.. 3 years old.  Tiffany has lost both her parents, and also hit with 20K in funeral bills, as neither of them had life insurance.  Charles, and Tammy had given up their home, to live with our Mother after the loss of our Dad in December 2011.  Our Dad was killed by a drunk driver on December 6 last year.  We have been hit HARD, as we have lost half of our family in a period of 6 months.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We need $20,000 to pay off both funerals... Any funds that we recieve are going directly to the funeral home, towards the funerals of both.  If you can help us, it will truely be a blessing, and appreciated more than I can describe!  Norton Funeral home in Hartsville, SC is whom we owe the money to, and you can see the obituary's online.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact at this point would be to lift 20K in debt from my 25 year old neice, as she is at a young age, with a young child, and in a really bad position in her life right now.. Tiffany has lost BOTH her parents, at the age of 25, and is responsible for the cost of BOTH funerals. </p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>For the longest time, Las Vegas had a severely underrepresented poetry and art scene throughout the city, but recently this has changed. First Friday in Las Vegas absolutely floods the 18b Art District, outstanding promoters are putting on great concerts and plays, and weekly open mics and monthly poetry slams have been inundated with new talent, eager to show off their skills to a local crowd.</p>
<p>Now, these remarkable performers are set to take their show to Cambridge, MA and represent Las Vegas at the National Poetry Slam. The National Poetry Slam is a competition of 80+ teams of poets from around the country, vying for huge prizes, national recognition, and most importantly building a community of thoughtful and articulate artists bent on making a difference in society. The Las Vegas Poetry Slam team wants desperately to be a part of this, to put Las Vegas back on the map, and to help increase visibility to bring more performers to feature in Las Vegas in the future, BUT WE NEED YOUR HELP!<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If our campaign succeeds, it will not only send our 5-man team to the National Poetry Slam, but will provide that team with a chance to bring it all back home by networking with incredible performers who can be brought in to help grow the scene right in Las Vegas. Success means turning Las Vegas Poetry from a small scene of dedicated writers, performers, and organizers into a national-level scene with regular featured poets, high-quality workshops, and more festival-style shows integrating outstanding spoken word performers with remarkable musicians.</p>
<p>If our campaign doesn't succeed, it won't be the end of the world, but it may be the end of a very incredible chance to provide high-quality, potentially life-changing art to our community in the future. Of course, shows will go on, but without your help to reach our funding goals, the scene may wither up into a sad husk of its current beauty - and no one wants that. SO PLEASE HELP!<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>We're trying to raise over $5000 altogether, and your contribution here on IndieGoGo matters! All of this funding goes toward team and venue registration with Poetry Slam, Inc. (~$800), team travel expenses for the National Poetry Slam event (~$4,000), and travel expenses for the regional competitions required to qualify us for National Poetry Slam (~$1,000). FEAR NOT! If we don't reach our full goal here on IndieGoGo, our fundraising continues all around Las Vegas and on-line, and all donations from IndieGoGo will still be directly applied to these expenses. Your money will not go to waste! Even if the team is unable to make our goal and send the whole group to Nationals, partial funding will help to send a group of non-competing representatives and any excess will all go into an on-going Las Vegas Poetry Slam fund, still to be used to effectively bring high quality artists to Las Vegas for performances, workshops, and seminars.<br/>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Aside from just helping fund our journey, you can lend a major hand by sharing this cause with your friends on Facebook and other social media, contributing promotional materials or discounted costs for such materials (flyers, airline buddy passes, hotel rewards) to reduce our overall expected costs, or simply spreading the word that art is alive in Las Vegas, and that people can help it achieve greater recognition in the midst of this jungle of one-armed bandits!<br/></p>

<p>We are a group of ten circus artists who have come together to create a new circus show for the summer of 2013 and ultimately plan to create a new circus company.</p>
<p>We are currently based out of Montreal where the ten of us study different circus disciplines. <em>Frequently Asked Questions</em> is made up of nine Americans and one member from Finland.</p>
<p>We all come from very different backgrounds but are strongly connected by our passion for circus. With this new show we hope to push our bodies and minds in order to create a truly unique experience for our audience. We have all been trained in both traditional and contemporary settings and plan to reflect our comprehensive foundation in our new show. With this show we hope to provide high quality performances at an affordable price in order to inspire people from all walks of life and spread our passion for the circus. </p>
<p>We are currently researching venues for next summer and hope to present our show in the North East region of the United States as well as in Quebec, Canada.</p>
<h2><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">How you can help!</span></h2>
<p>We are determined to get this project off the ground and we are fully prepared to commit countless unpaid hours in order to have an extraordinary final product.</p>
<p>The money we raise will be used over the course of this year in order to create our show. Some of our foreseen costs include equipment, transportation, insurance, rehearsal space and promotional material.</p>

<h3>My name is <a href=""http://eveningdoe.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Amber Doe"">Amber Doe,</a> I am a sculptor and filmmaker.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is a Doe in Finland?</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong>Me. I have been selected as an Artist in Residence at the <a href=""http://www.arteles.org/index.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Arteles"">Arteles Creative Center</a> in Finland for my birthday month of March (2013). I have been selected based on a proposed light and textile sculpture I will create while at the residency.</p>
<p><strong>Why a light and textile based sculpture in Finland?</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong>Personally, I have always been inspired by textile art and the concept of clothing and textile as forms of communication, self-expression and empowerment. The history of textiles is steeped in the concept of textile work as women's work. Textile production for families, villages and the larger community has always been a way for women in various parts of the world to communicate, express themselves, and illustrate cultural value systems.</p>
<p><br/>Another important theme in my work is the concept of home. Inspired by the fact that the spider creates his own home by spinning an organic substance, I created a sculpture called <em>rope skirt. </em>The <em>rope skirt </em>illustrated both of my thematic preoccupations, the skirt was connected to gender, but the shape of the skirt was abstract and could also be seen as a version of shelter.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In Finland, I seek to develop these themes even further using the bee as muse this time instead of the spider. I want to weave a textile out of various light sources in the shape of a bee hive. The structure will be viewed one person at a time. I am curious about the kind of reflection that will take place alone in a light filled space connecting to an art and concept as old as 20,000 BC. The first images from caves in Lespugue, France illustrate a woman wearing a skirt of twisted strings and warm light around her. I believe a piece like the light structure I want to create has the potential to illustrate the connectivity, support and empowerment of females around the world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Finland in the winter would be a beautiful place to view this light and textile sculpture.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Your Help</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong>I need your help. I was selected very late in the game and have a very short period of time to raise the necessary funds to make this residency happen. This project will only be possible with the help of many people. I would be so grateful for your help by making a donation of any size. IndieGoGo is a game changer, because if you pay by PayPal , I am able to access funds as soon as they are pledged and most of the expenses will be be due before the end of the drive. Also it is important to know that you don't have to have a PayPal account to donate to this drive.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How I will spend the money</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong>Funds raised will pay for 1/2 of my residency fees (Arteles pays the other half), Travel expenses, Food, and Project Materials (which are very expensive in Finland and expensive to ship from the US even if purchased here cheaply)!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>It is such a huge honor to be selected as an Artist in Residence at Arteles and I would be so humbled and grateful to get the opportunity to practice my art and continue to share it with the world.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Sincerely any contribution will help. Please do all you can to spread the word!<br/></strong></p>
<p>I want to add a special thank you to my Dad, Mom, Angeline (2nd mom), Tracy, Linda, Alisha, Kathryn, Genevieve and Brandon.</p>

<h3>Here's the scoop</h3>
<p>I'm headed to Ethiopia in November with the The American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) to assist in their critical aid work relating to clean water, education, and health. Almost half of all Ethiopian children are malnourished, two thirds haven't attended secondary school, and almost 80% don't have access to clean drinking water. Meeting with <span>development professionals</span> on the ground and helping them improve infrastructure to combat these issues will hopefully go a long way to both improve the situation on the ground and raise awareness of the larger problems facing the region.</p>
<p>Help me help others! Your donation will help me cover program costs. In appreciation, I will help you decorate with original art. I've listed a range of ditigal and hand-painted prints and some other fun goodies that can all be yours. </p>
<div>
<h3>What you get</h3>
<p>It's art for a cause. See photos of the pieces in question in the gallery tab. Because this is a trip through the JDC, the art is Jewish-themed. If that's not your bag, email me and we'll figure something out that suits you better. If you live in LA, or if you live in New York and you contribute before October 22, I'll hand-deliver your gift as well. You are also welcome to donate without claiming a item.</p>
</div>
<h3>What I do</h3>
<p>In my day-job as an LA-based graphic designer and artist, you can often find me outside my apartment, spray paint in hand, stenciling the afternoon away.  I've exhibited pieces in shows around LA, and I'm a winner of the SEDER arts grant for my spray paint pieces. I taught stenciling to middle and high schoolers at Camp Ramah and will be teaching at day schools around LA in the coming year.</p>
<p>I work with a range of non-profits and small businesses from across the Jewish spectrum and beyond, including The Jewish Federation, Aish International, Pressman, YULA, Shalhevet, Temple Beth Hillel, and others, helping them better represent their messages and educate their audiences. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Where it all goes</h3>
<p>Money raised will go directly to program and travel costs as I travel across the world to help those in need. Any funds exceeding program costs will be split between supporting the JDC in their missions aiding communities worldwide and toward future community art programming in Los Angeles, including better safety equipment for my classes with kids and teens, and supplies and legal permits for a planned community mural. </p>
<h3>What else you can do</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Do you know people who like art? People who like Ethiopia? People? Pass this on! Also, if you have any school supplies (backpacks, pencils, notebooks, etc.) or clothes and shoes you'd like to me to bring to Ethiopia, let me know so we can make arrangements.</p>

<h2>The why.</h2>
<p>My name is Charlie Goering. I am a young painter entering my junior year in college. I am in the process transfering to Laguna College of Art and Design from the Art Academy of Cincinnati. My current education was severly lacking in helping me to learn what I want to learn which is represetational painting. I need help funding gas, food and some lodging on my trip across our beautiful country with my brother. We plan on leaving the first week in August and travelling the whole month. The plan is to take a northern route arching up and driving down into Laguna Beach. Once we have arrived I will move into my new place, my brother will fly home, and I will begin school.</p>
<p>My calling to become an artist came at an early age. I always drew as a young boy, but through the influence ofmy best friend in 2004, I began taking art classes with local artist, Keith Klein. From the very first time I stepped foot in his studio I knew the path my life was to take. I was blessed early on to have figured out what I wanted to do with my life. My goal in life to be most successful and be the best painter I can be.</p>

<p><b>Moon-Age</b></p><p><b>
</b></p><p>Moon-age is a multi-media artist and stylist originating from Australia. Moon-Age seeks to integrate her experience in art direction and styling for photo shoots and music videos with performance work influenced by Butoh and the Theatre of the Grotesque.  She is now creating experimental electronic music which she will use as the glue for the Theatrum Chemicum series.</p><p>Moon-Age has contributed her visual talents to the likes of Iggy Azelia, Tank Magazine, Show Studio, Vice Magazine, Schon Magazine, Channel 4 (UK). </p><p>Her work has been shown at The Center Pompidu in Paris, SONAR multi-media festival in Spain as well as in group and solo shows in Sydney and Berlin. Moon-Age also curates a series of immersive events known as 'Chapel Perilous' in London and now in Berlin, in which she seeks to break down the barriers between performance and audience. </p><p></p>
<p><b>Hellza Haus</b></p><p></p><p>Hellza is a multi-media artist living and working in Berlin. Throughout her creative life she engaged with different forms of artistic expression such as sculpture, fashion, photography, music and physical theatre. Today she creates images and videos which make use of these multi-disciplinary experiences, combining different skills and enjoying a broader perspective on the creative process.</p><p>Whether designing sets and costumes, developing concepts or directing, Hellza is passionate about creating sublime visuals with other-worldly symbolism. Her colourful images make use of simple materials such and paper and fabric, these can transform and morph in real time to create an organic atmosphere.</p><p><b>Producer: Erin McBean</b><br/></p><p><b>Director of Photography: <a href=""http://tobijall.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://tobijall.com/</a></b></p><p><b>Choreographer: <a href=""http://rebecca-halls.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://rebecca-halls.com/</a></b></p><p><b>Still Photography: Louie Vignat</b></p><p></p><p></p>

<p></p></div>","THEATRUM CHEMICUM
This will be the first video of an on-going series that explores alchemic traditions through a fusion of art, performance, fashion and design. Each video is one part of a transformative journey that slowly reveals more clues, characters and stunning locations. In this oneiric world, anything is possible.  



The first video of the series will be filmed in Berlin; where the city’s architecture and atmosphere matches our alchemic vision. 
Each location in Berlin will be transformed by the performers within the space and props and costumes in vibrant, rich colours such as royal blue, turquoise, ochre, red, maroon and white. Amalgamating into what will look like a moving painting.Please watch the video above to get a taster of the video series to come... We have included images from a test shoot we did with photographer Louie Vignat to give you an idea of the mood of the film. THE COLLABORATORS so far..
This is an ongoing collaborative project between multidisciplinary creatives such as artists, designers, performers and video-makers- It is directed by artists Moon-Age and Hellza House. 
Moon-Age
Moon-age is a multi-media artist and stylist originating from Australia. Moon-Age seeks to integrate her experience in art direction and styling for photo shoots and music videos with performance work influenced by Butoh and the Theatre of the Grotesque.  She is now creating experimental electronic music which she will use as the glue for the Theatrum Chemicum series.Moon-Age has contributed her visual talents to the likes of Iggy Azelia, Tank Magazine, Show Studio, Vice Magazine, Schon Magazine, Channel 4 (UK). Her work has been shown at The Center Pompidu in Paris, SONAR multi-media festival in Spain as well as in group and solo shows in Sydney and Berlin. Moon-Age also curates a series of immersive events known as 'Chapel Perilous' in London and now in Berlin, in which she seeks to break down the barriers between performance and audience. 
Hellza HausHellza is a multi-media artist living and working in Berlin. Throughout her creative life she engaged with different forms of artistic expression such as sculpture, fashion, photography, music and physical theatre. Today she creates images and videos which make use of these multi-disciplinary experiences, combining different skills and enjoying a broader perspective on the creative process.Whether designing sets and costumes, developing concepts or directing, Hellza is passionate about creating sublime visuals with other-worldly symbolism. Her colourful images make use of simple materials such and paper and fabric, these can transform and morph in real time to create an organic atmosphere.Producer: Erin McBeanDirector of Photography: http://tobijall.com/Choreographer: http://rebecca-halls.com/Still Photography: Louie Vignat
LET'S MAKE IT HAPPEN To get this project off the ground we need the following: 

film equipment- Camera hire, lighting

materials for costumes- We are creating numerous intricate costumes also in collaboration with Designers Mary Benson and Andrew Yates

materials for props- All props will be especially created for the film
location
catering
van hire 

We want to give people a story to follow, a visual puzzle to unravel, using the internet as a vehicle. The creators involved are alchemist's in they are seeking to transform themselves through the creative process and other pursuits such as meditation, travel, workshops, body work, ritual, play and collaboration. We hope to inspire others to fuse together different modes of expression and make exciting use of the spaces available to them in their city.THE FUTUREWe hope to expand the project in future, and film in locations across the globe.

<div>What it is, who is chosen, and why?</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Portraits done of influential and inspiring people who use their influence in music, poetry, journalism, activism, and literature to fight violence or mistreatment of human beings all over the world. </li>
<li>The drawings are created using the person's own words and are meant to show not only a likeness of the person, but also some of their values and motivations in life. It's meant to be a more comprehensive look at a individual than traditional portraiture. </li>
<li>I want to help fundraise and help spread these heroes' message of compassion and hope through art and with donations from my fans!</li>
</ul>
<h2><br/></h2>
</div>
<h2>Who I am and why I am doing this...</h2>
<div><ul>
<li>I am Michael Volpicelli, an artist from the Philadelphia area. I am best known for my word art style of drawing, where I draw realistic looking portraits using only words. I am using this talent currently to try and spread the words of people who I believe are motivational and have positive messages. I think that through art, a person can make a ripple all over the world and influence people to help reinforce ideals of love, peace, and compassion for all people.  <br/>
</li>
<li>I believe that this goal is important because it's sad to turn on the news and see wars everywhere. Recently I had a baby girl named Lorelei, and I don't want her growing up in a world where people are so cruel and negative towards each other. So I want to make a difference.<br/>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>What I am looking to achieve through this fundraiser...</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<div><ul><li>I want to create a series of 5-6 drawings of influencal people from all over the world with a positive message and create a cohesive series. I am asking for donations because it takes a lot of time to research each person and then to complete each drawing. Your donation will be split, so 50% of it will go to the different foundations and charities supported by the people I choose to draw, and the other 50% will go to me as the artist so I can pay for gallery fees and expenses, pay for supplies , and be able to market this project effectively.<br/>
</li></ul></div>
<div>The remaining 50% will go to the charities, and organizations such as:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>The Mattie J.T. Stepanek Foundation. They spread messages of hope and peace by offering educational programs, activities, and resources that support an understanding of peace.  <a href=""http://www.mattieonline.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.mattieonline.com</a>

What it is, who is chosen, and why?


Portraits done of influential and inspiring people who use their influence in music, poetry, journalism, activism, and literature to fight violence or mistreatment of human beings all over the world. 
The drawings are created using the person's own words and are meant to show not only a likeness of the person, but also some of their values and motivations in life. It's meant to be a more comprehensive look at a individual than traditional portraiture. 
I want to help fundraise and help spread these heroes' message of compassion and hope through art and with donations from my fans!



Who I am and why I am doing this...

I am Michael Volpicelli, an artist from the Philadelphia area. I am best known for my word art style of drawing, where I draw realistic looking portraits using only words. I am using this talent currently to try and spread the words of people who I believe are motivational and have positive messages. I think that through art, a person can make a ripple all over the world and influence people to help reinforce ideals of love, peace, and compassion for all people.  

I believe that this goal is important because it's sad to turn on the news and see wars everywhere. Recently I had a baby girl named Lorelei, and I don't want her growing up in a world where people are so cruel and negative towards each other. So I want to make a difference.



What I am looking to achieve through this fundraiser...

I want to create a series of 5-6 drawings of influencal people from all over the world with a positive message and create a cohesive series. I am asking for donations because it takes a lot of time to research each person and then to complete each drawing. Your donation will be split, so 50% of it will go to the different foundations and charities supported by the people I choose to draw, and the other 50% will go to me as the artist so I can pay for gallery fees and expenses, pay for supplies , and be able to market this project effectively.

The remaining 50% will go to the charities, and organizations such as:


The Mattie J.T. Stepanek Foundation. They spread messages of hope and peace by offering educational programs, activities, and resources that support an understanding of peace.  http://www.mattieonline.com

Gua Africa, which supports education in South Africa. No more child soldiers! http://www.gua-africa.org

The Malala Fund, which supports issues involving young woman all over the world. The goal is to give access to a high quality education to young women on a community level. http://www.malala.org

...and more to come...

Lets make a difference in the world one piece of artwork at a time! And if I do not reach my goal all funds will still be equally divided between myself and the listed foundations above.

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">Our Organization</span><br/>
</h3>
<p>CY8ORG Design is an independent, art-centered company that started in Quito, Ecuador. Currently, our primary endeavor is producing small quantities of unique, quality clothing with original designs. We work with a professional seamstress to create the style of shirt we want, and use a process called heat-transfer sublimation to print hand-drawn or -painted designs onto the shirts. In this process, the ink fuses with polyester fibers in the shirt, making the design blend seamlessly with the fabric, avoiding the rubbery texture generally left by serigraphy, or screen-printing. Each design is used only a handful of times. What interests us is not mass-production, but quality and exclusivity. Our first production was received with lots of enthusiasm - both in Ecuador and in the United States. Only with a great deal of help from friends has it been possible to establish CY8ORG Design as a successful, independent clothing line - now we need to expand our community in order to expand our business, which is why we have created this campaign. </p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">Having gotten this far, we want to take the next step. We want to shift our focus to creative education and direct encouragement of the arts, rather than simple distribution. We have big dreams of growth in the future, including relocating to the Bellavista neighborhood in Santiago, Chile to open an educational, artistic, and (multi)cultural space. This space would include a gallery with art and original clothing on display and for sale, a simple café, book exchange, and a space to organize classes and events. </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: left;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">We need funds in order to rent and equip such a space - for framing artwork, decorating, advertising, purchasing books, and providing materials to be used in art classes, as well as appliances and seating for the café.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">If our goal of $15,000 is reached we could decorate and equip an amazing space for artists, students, and community members, but with just part of that we could do a lot. We would pursue alternative funding options, such as loans, to obtain everything necessary to create the planned space, and start work with whatever funds we obtain through this campaign.<br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">For smaller donations, we also have electronic and paper copies of Kendra's autobiographical, bilingual, 30-page ""graphic story"", ""Anagnorisis"", a sort of prequel to CY8ORG Desgin. Our more expensive perks range from original prints and posters to one-of-a-kind shirts. The posters have been hand screenprinted by our designer/artist-in-residence, Kendra Lyons. The shirts are made by hand in Quito Ecuador by an independent seamstress, printed locally by a small business, and feature Kendra's original designs. Each is a unique combination of color, style, and design - a work of art in itself.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Torches of Freedom:</b> <i>Each design by CY8ORG contains a message, philosophy, or story. The design below was originally a screen-printed poster highlighting Edward Bernays, an important historical figure who, despite his enormous influence on the advertising industry, has been largely forgotten. Bernays,</i><i> the nephew of Freud, used his uncle's ideas to sell products. He </i><i>authored a book called ""Propaganda"" which inspired the Nazi propagandist Goebbels. This design tells the story of how Bernays, while working for Lucy Strike, single-handedly opened the tobacco market to women by paying debutants to walk in a suffrage march while smoking cigarettes, a very taboo practice for women at the time. A story about the incident was published by the local press under the title ""Torches of Freedom"", suggesting that cigarettes were phallic symbols of male power that could be ""taken"" by women, simply by smoking one. </i></p>

<h3 style=""text-align: left;"">The Impact</h3>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">So far, we have had immense success with the clothing we've produced. However, we want to do more - not just to distribute art, but to encourage creativity. Latin America is full of budding artists and movements, and we want to encourage and participate actively in this cultural revolution. The interest in the arts is there - but the infrastructure sometimes isn't. We want to provide a unique and diverse space that caters to the artistic and intellecutual needs of an artistic community, close to universities and museums in Santiago's Bellavista neighborhood, a growing hothouse of artistic activity. </p>

Only with a great deal of help from friends has it been possible to establish CY8ORG Design as a successful, independent clothing line - now we need to expand our community in order to expand our business, which is why we have created this campaign. 




Friends helped us with modeling and photography (above).
Working on a design for shirts (below).

Having gotten this far, we want to take the next step. We want to shift our focus to creative education and direct encouragement of the arts, rather than simple distribution. We have big dreams of growth in the future, including relocating to the Bellavista neighborhood in Santiago, Chile to open an educational, artistic, and (multi)cultural space. This space would include a gallery with art and original clothing on display and for sale, a simple café, book exchange, and a space to organize classes and events. 
What We Need & What You Get
We need funds in order to rent and equip such a space - for framing artwork, decorating, advertising, purchasing books, and providing materials to be used in art classes, as well as appliances and seating for the café.
If our goal of $15,000 is reached we could decorate and equip an amazing space for artists, students, and community members, but with just part of that we could do a lot. We would pursue alternative funding options, such as loans, to obtain everything necessary to create the planned space, and start work with whatever funds we obtain through this campaign.
For smaller donations, we also have electronic and paper copies of Kendra's autobiographical, bilingual, 30-page ""graphic story"", ""Anagnorisis"", a sort of prequel to CY8ORG Desgin. Our more expensive perks range from original prints and posters to one-of-a-kind shirts. The posters have been hand screenprinted by our designer/artist-in-residence, Kendra Lyons. The shirts are made by hand in Quito Ecuador by an independent seamstress, printed locally by a small business, and feature Kendra's original designs. Each is a unique combination of color, style, and design - a work of art in itself.
Torches of Freedom: Each design by CY8ORG contains a message, philosophy, or story. The design below was originally a screen-printed poster highlighting Edward Bernays, an important historical figure who, despite his enormous influence on the advertising industry, has been largely forgotten. Bernays, the nephew of Freud, used his uncle's ideas to sell products. He authored a book called ""Propaganda"" which inspired the Nazi propagandist Goebbels. This design tells the story of how Bernays, while working for Lucy Strike, single-handedly opened the tobacco market to women by paying debutants to walk in a suffrage march while smoking cigarettes, a very taboo practice for women at the time. A story about the incident was published by the local press under the title ""Torches of Freedom"", suggesting that cigarettes were phallic symbols of male power that could be ""taken"" by women, simply by smoking one. 


The Impact
So far, we have had immense success with the clothing we've produced. However, we want to do more - not just to distribute art, but to encourage creativity. Latin America is full of budding artists and movements, and we want to encourage and participate actively in this cultural revolution. The interest in the arts is there - but the infrastructure sometimes isn't. We want to provide a unique and diverse space that caters to the artistic and intellecutual needs of an artistic community, close to universities and museums in Santiago's Bellavista neighborhood, a growing hothouse of artistic activity.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Yvonne Fly Onakeme Etaghene and I am a queer Nigerian woman, poet, dancer, actress and visual artist.  I've spent my life between the U.S. and Nigeria and because of this have often thought and made art about queer African identities and experiences.  GUAVA is a performance piece that will address queer African sexuality and how immigration and geographic location impact that.  GUAVA will document stories that are often ignored and marginalized and utilize art to share those stories as well as engage in conversations about queer African sexuality.  GUAVA will be performed in Nigeria and South Africa and will take place in partnership with LGBTQ African organizations.  Each performance will be accompanied by a workshop or community discussion that engages the political issues raised in the performance.  The intention of GUAVA is for queer Africans to share our own stories in our own words.  In addition, each community member present at a GUAVA performance/workshop will receive a free copy of ""GUAVA: Poems &amp; Workshops"" (a collection of poetry &amp; community engagement workshops.)  It is important that we document our work and share it and create our own herstories/histories.</p>
<p>I make this art and do this work because I do not know any other queer Nigerian poets performing these poems and saying these things in the ways that I am.  This work is necessary because I want to contribute to a global queer African community full of passionate warriors committed to speaking our truths and creating safe spaces for our lives to sparkle and flourish.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>GUAVA needs $10,000 to accomplish the goals I have set forth.  The funds raised will go towards plane tickets, the GUAVA: Poems &amp; Workshops (a collection of poetry &amp; community engagement workshops), booking performance and rehearsal space, recording the video components of the performance piece and marketing materials.  All funds raised in excess of $10,000 will go towards expanding the African Tour of Guava.  If we don't make our goal, this project will most definitely still happen, just in fewer venues.</p>
<p>PERKS: I've lovingly chosen the perks with the same care and attention I would if I was making a care package.  It's fitting that so many perks are works of art I've created or will create because this project is about connecting with people via the incredibly powerful medium of art.  Crocheted earrings, crocheted infinity scarves, stickers, prints of my paintings, a writing workshop or performance of mine!  So much goodness!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Loving Impact Of This Work</h3>
<p>As I mentioned above, I don't know any other queer Nigerian women making art about the subject matters I do in the ways that I do.  It is important that we tell these stories because so much of how we understand and believe that we matter as human beings is by seeing ourselves reflected in the people around us, in the art around us, in the books, movies, communities around us.  The reason I am performing this work and traveling with it is because all of us deserve to know that our stories matter and are beautiful.</p>

We at Sixty Inches From Center are not trying to reinvent the wheel. We are looking for ways to strengthen the arts programs, artist collaboratives and creative practices or spaces that already exist and bring together the many different underground organizations, artists and collectives that are doing amazing things. Our goal is to create new bridges and act as facilitators of collaboration in Chicago’s art scene.</span>
</h3>
<h3 style="""">This is a Media Match Drive. What's that?  <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">Now that Chicago Artist Month, one of the busiest art months of the year, has come to a close and we have officially launched the website, it is on with the next line of projects for us at SIFC. It came to our knowledge about a week ago that our media and marketing advisor’s company Clarion New Media wants to sponsor us for a short campaign. Our last campaign was set out to raise funds that will help supplement our media needs concerning new equipment and we only got a small fraction of our goal. Clarion New Media fully recognizes how important our project is to the Chicago arts community after working with us since we first approached them last spring with our idea.  <b>Clarion New Media believes in our mission and to encourage others to participate that they will match every dollar amount donated up to $1,500 dollars for our next campaign.</b>  <b>The funds raised will be used to purchase the equipment that we so desperately need so we can function in a more efficient, visually appealing and professional manor.</b>  Clarion New Media has already donated their time in developing our new website, producing videos and training our staff to produce and publish engaging content.</span>
</h3>
<h3 style="""">What will these funds be used for? <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">We need things such as Sanyo VPC-CG20 Dual HD 10MP Camcorders, DSLR NEX-5 cameras and Olympus WS 400S 1 GB Digital voice recorders for our team. In order for these items to function correctly, we need other things such as memory cards, external hard drives, memory card readers, hardware updates, and software updates.  We are also filing for our non-profit status, so some of the funds will contribute to making that happen.</span>
</h3>
<h3 style="""">Together we can make this happen!  <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">We are very appreciative for this opportunity to raise double our goal of  $1,500. And all we need to reach this number is a minimum of 150 donations at $10 dollars or 75 donations at $20. If you feel exceptionally generous all donations over $100 will receive special recognition on our website with donor status along with an associated website link.  For those who are willing to donate amounts under $100, please keep in mind what your contribution is allowing us at SIFC to accomplish. Our efforts bring under publicized art of Chicago to the world. Make the match and help Sixty Inches From Center reach our goal!</span>

</div></div>","**$10, $20 or $50 from you means $20, $40, or $100 to help SIFC accomplish BIG things!**
Clarion New Media is sponsoring the SIFC Chicago Media Match Drive, where they will match any amount of donations to SIFC for an amount up to $1,500--meaning if we make our goal of $1,500, they will give us $1,500, giving us a total of $3,000 to update our team's media equipment and help us file for non-profit status!

What is SIFC anyway? Sixty Inches From Center: Chicago Arts Archive and Collective Project (SIFC) is an organization that documents and displays online the art that exists outside the “center”. We at Sixty Inches From Center are not trying to reinvent the wheel. We are looking for ways to strengthen the arts programs, artist collaboratives and creative practices or spaces that already exist and bring together the many different underground organizations, artists and collectives that are doing amazing things. Our goal is to create new bridges and act as facilitators of collaboration in Chicago’s art scene.

This is a Media Match Drive. What's that?  Now that Chicago Artist Month, one of the busiest art months of the year, has come to a close and we have officially launched the website, it is on with the next line of projects for us at SIFC. It came to our knowledge about a week ago that our media and marketing advisor’s company Clarion New Media wants to sponsor us for a short campaign. Our last campaign was set out to raise funds that will help supplement our media needs concerning new equipment and we only got a small fraction of our goal. Clarion New Media fully recognizes how important our project is to the Chicago arts community after working with us since we first approached them last spring with our idea.  Clarion New Media believes in our mission and to encourage others to participate that they will match every dollar amount donated up to $1,500 dollars for our next campaign.  The funds raised will be used to purchase the equipment that we so desperately need so we can function in a more efficient, visually appealing and professional manor.  Clarion New Media has already donated their time in developing our new website, producing videos and training our staff to produce and publish engaging content.

What will these funds be used for? We need things such as Sanyo VPC-CG20 Dual HD 10MP Camcorders, DSLR NEX-5 cameras and Olympus WS 400S 1 GB Digital voice recorders for our team. In order for these items to function correctly, we need other things such as memory cards, external hard drives, memory card readers, hardware updates, and software updates.  We are also filing for our non-profit status, so some of the funds will contribute to making that happen.

Together we can make this happen!  We are very appreciative for this opportunity to raise double our goal of  $1,500. And all we need to reach this number is a minimum of 150 donations at $10 dollars or 75 donations at $20. If you feel exceptionally generous all donations over $100 will receive special recognition on our website with donor status along with an associated website link.  For those who are willing to donate amounts under $100, please keep in mind what your contribution is allowing us at SIFC to accomplish. Our efforts bring under publicized art of Chicago to the world. Make the match and help Sixty Inches From Center reach our goal!


How else can you help?  Spread the word to art lovers and Chicagoans.  Tell a friend!  Tell an artist!  Bring it up at Thanksgiving dinner!  And visit us and Clarion New Media online:

<p>Help us fund Uganda's first ever public camera obscura!!!</p>
<p>We are a trio of Kampala based visual artists/filmmakers who will be exhibiting Uganda's first camera obscura at the 7th LaBa Art Festival (25th May, 2013). The theme for this year's festival is ""Open Studio"", where artists are supposed to present their work an show the process of production"". We came with the idea to construct a camera obscura which would both entertain and show the science behind what we do in its most basic sense.</p>
<p>We are naming the camera obscura 'Strange Fruit' as there will be two actors hanging upside down on the outside of the studio, which will create an inverted image of their hair standing on end on the inside of the camera. The name is also a twist on the Billie Holiday song of the same name, in which she used the metaphor to describe the lynchings of african-americans. This time we are using the metaphor in a more playful manner.</p>
<h3><strong>Why we need your contributions?</strong></h3>
<p>We are looking to raise 501 US dollars which will go towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Construction of dark room</li>
<li>Construction of monkey bars installation</li>
<li>Actors, paint and make-up</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Who we are?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Eric Mukalazi</strong> is a self-taught visual artist from Kampala. His practice generally utilises the mediums of film, photography and animation. His work explores themes of modern Ugandan identities through; hip hop, fashion, sub cultures and youth. Mukalazi was one of twelve artists that exhibited at the first KLA Contemporary Art Festival in 2012 with his 3D animation ‘Breezy Nuts’. He is currently undergoing a residency at 32º East | Ugandan Arts Trust.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Alex Lyons</strong> is a visual artist from London that currently lives and works in Kampala. He trained in ‘Film &amp; TV’ at the University of the Arts London where he worked on a number of documentaries and dramas as well as exploring video art and photography. His work is exhibited in an experimental manner, which is designed so that he can observe the human interaction with his films. Lyons has been involved in a number of group exhibitions in London, Paris and Madrid before coming to Uganda to undertake a residency and mentorship scheme at 32º East | Ugandan Arts Trust.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Mugeni Mukanga</strong> has been an Artistic Director at Dragonfly Media since 2008. Under Dragonfly Media, he has worked in close collaboration with Eric Mukalazi and Alex Lyons of 32 Degrees East by providing research, technical assistance and artistic direction on several projects including; <em>Breezy Nuts</em> (KLA ART 2012), <em>Power </em>(Baboon Forest, 2012), <em>Criminal Swag </em>(Young Zee/Swangz Avenue, 2012)<em> Chart Dimensions</em> (Recycling Materials, Thomas Aquilina.

<p>I’m an emerging artist in Portland, Oregon. After receiving my studio art degree in Asheville, NC, I had the opportunity to spend time at Penland School of Crafts as a studio assistant. The artist I worked with suggested that I explore myself and community through residency as a way to discovery in my art practice. I’m taking her advice!</p>
<p>I have been accepted as an artist-in-residence at the Abetenim Arts Village near the city of Kumasi in Ghana for  November 2013 through the non-profit organization NKA Foundation. As a resident, I will learn West African dance in the Ashanti region with community members and incorporate that dance into a landscape related video project. </p>
<p>Art and travel shifts perspective for me immensely. Not only will I meet new people and dance, but I hope to create something that will lay the groundwork for others to have a perspective shift as well. The NKA Foundation brings international artists to a rural community so that we can share our experiences with each other and grow. I am responsible for raising 100% of the funds for this amazing experience. </p>
<p>I could do this for $3,000. Here’s where the money will go:</p>
<p>$1,500 airfare, $300 lodging/food costs, $600 vaccinations/visa, $600 fees/supplies</p>
<p>Any and all support is most appreciated! Not only will you have my absolute appreciation, but you will also receive different perks that range from a personal, hand-written postcard from Africa to producer credit in the final video with a public thanks from NKA Foundation. Everyone who contributes will be included by name in a thank you on my blog. </p>

<p>Our goal is to reach $2000.</p>
<p>The money is going to be divided into a few categories of what we need.</p>
<p>Our friend Jitters is having car troubles and really needs money to help him out, so part of it is going to him.</p>
<p>The next part is going to Ensayne and I's travelling and whatever other costs we have to get to a stable home.</p>
<p>Another part is going to another friend that needs some help.</p>
<p>The last bit will go into the development of the project rewards I'm offering.</p>
<p>When we reach $1000, I'll make a rpgmaker horror game that'll be for everyone to play. After the kickstarter ends, I'll have a vote for exactly what kind of Horror it'll be.</p>
<p>One of the choices is The White Mice which is a horror/sci-fi about a kid who goes to a Private School and learns that it's not what it seems.</p>

<p>If we do surpass our goal and reach $3000, I will do another game that'll be of Corrupted Twilight going to other worlds with her vortex manipulator, it'll probably be a puzzle/action game.</p>

<p></p>
<p>My name is Angela Gooliaff and I’m
an emerging visual artist living in Vancouver, BC, Canada. I have a passion for
telling stories, especially stories about tiny but fascinating creatures among
us – bugs!</p>
<p>My favourite subject to draw is ants.
And I hope these ants will take me all the way to France. Why ants? Because
they are admirable and multi-dimensional little beings. No one works harder
than an ant. In my greeting cards, I have also expanded to other interesting and
beautiful bugs such as British Columbia’s Rugose stag beetle, a Blue Morpho
butterfly, ladybugs, dragonflies and others. </p>
<p>My goal is to raise $5,000.00 to
attend DRAWinternational, an artist residency program in Caylus, France.  DRAWinternational provides illustrators
a one-month opportunity to focus entirely on their artwork, expanding their
ideas and creativity, and collaborate with other like-minded artists. I am honoured
to have received acceptance to this program.</p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><p><span class=""notranlsate""></span></p>

Thank you to everyone who has contributed to this
campaign. I’m thrilled to announce that I have reached my goal early. If you
contributed — THANK YOU! Your support means a lot to me. 
Because the campaign is active until November 30, you can still get your holiday greeting cards, or any of the other
perks, through me via this campaign.
Further proceeds will be used to cover the following expenses:
1. 
An
additional $2,000 (for a total goal of $7,000)
will cover the printing costs of the
greeting cards.
2. 
An
additional $500 (total goal $7,500) would cover the Indiegogo, Paypal and postage expenses, and allow me to use all of the contributions
towards my residency.
3. 
Finally,
if I can raise an additional $2,000.00 (total goal $9,500),
I would have the funds to extend my stay at the residency for an additional
month. The additional time would be ideal to further
develop my large-format drawings. I
would apply to extend my stay at the residency, if
it is looking
like a possibility through the campaign and from amazing support of the contributors.


Please note: I
have added an additional perk to the
campaign: Santa’s (very happy)
Helper. Thank you so much!!!



The Big Idea

My name is Angela Gooliaff and I’m
an emerging visual artist living in Vancouver, BC, Canada. I have a passion for
telling stories, especially stories about tiny but fascinating creatures among
us – bugs!
My favourite subject to draw is ants.
And I hope these ants will take me all the way to France. Why ants? Because
they are admirable and multi-dimensional little beings. No one works harder
than an ant. In my greeting cards, I have also expanded to other interesting and
beautiful bugs such as British Columbia’s Rugose stag beetle, a Blue Morpho
butterfly, ladybugs, dragonflies and others. 
My goal is to raise $5,000.00 to
attend DRAWinternational, an artist residency program in Caylus, France.  DRAWinternational provides illustrators
a one-month opportunity to focus entirely on their artwork, expanding their
ideas and creativity, and collaborate with other like-minded artists. I am honoured
to have received acceptance to this program.






I have a Bachelor of Science, majoring in Biology with a Psychology minor, along with a Bachelor of Fine Arts from Emily Carr University.

<h3>The project</h3>
<p>The 4 crown project is a special project for me. I was thinking already longer to start this project. And now I start the project. Around the world there are not many good quality replica crowns. And especially not crowns you can rent! The original crowns are of course not to rent for anybody. The Dutch crown is normal locked up. And the three English crowns don’t leave the Tower of London. With this project I can make many dreams come true!</p>
<p>How will it be if you have a special party and you have this four amazing crowns on your party! Everyone will be jealous on you. How does he/she come to this 4 amazing crowns! You can’t even see by yourself the difference between the original or the replica. This is just one example where you can hire the crowns for! There are many other examples.</p>
<p>Before I could start the project I was searching what for kind of materials I want to use. And what is possible. I get advice from different silversmith’s. And they gived me good advice. After the advice I start searching on the internet for the materials. Is it possible how I want to make the crowns? And now I finished that part of the research. And yes it’s possible!</p>
<p>After the research I need a company that could help me with my project. On the start it wasn’t easy to find a company. But on 30-04-2013 we get in the Netherlands a new King. And they talked a lot about the crown and the company that made the crown for King Willem II. So I contact that company and they replied me they want to help me with this interesting project. The company name is: Bonebakker (based in Amsterdam <a href=""http://www.bonebakker.nl/en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.bonebakker.nl/en</a>). They made in 1840 the original crown from King Willem II.</p>
<p><img alt=""The official draw of the crown for King Willem II in 1840."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/1000399_545137795522319_700159097_n.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""The dutch crown""/></p>
<p>The official draw of the crown for King Willem II in 1840 made by Bonebakker.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So now I know what for kind of materials I want to use. And I found a company that can help me. So I can start with my project! I made this page on Indiegogo to start my project. Of course I hope you all will support me to finish this great project and I can make the four high quality crowns.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Company</h3>
<p>After this four crowns are made what I want to do with the four crowns? After this crowns are made I want to start my own business in it. At the start I want to exhibite the crowns for a short time on different locations. After the exhibite people can rent the crowns from me. And I want to exhibite them on special events. When the crowns not be rented they will be showed in glasses showcases. There will also become a site where I will put all the information on when the crowns are made. People can see there all the rent information and what for special events I want to do. Will there be a market for renting the crowns? Yes there is! I researched a long time if there is a market for renting. I saw a lot of people that searched for crowns like this but they can’t find good quality crowns for renting.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The crowns</h3>
<p>To make this crowns is an very expensive job. The crowns will be made with the best quality materials there are. When we reached the first goal we will start with the first crown.</p>

<p>Goal 1: The Dutch crown</p>

<h3>FACs</h3>
<p><strong><span lang=""EN-GB"" style="""">1. Why are the English crowns more expencive to make like the Dutch crown?</span></strong></p>
<p><span lang=""EN-GB"" style="""">A: For the english crowns we need more materials. They used in the English crowns more gems and other materials like in the Dutch crown.</span></p>
<p><strong><span lang=""EN-GB"" style="""">2. What are synthetic stones?</span></strong></p>
<p><span lang=""EN-GB"" style="""">A: Synthetic stones are human made stones. They become from a laboratory.</span></p>
<p><strong><span lang=""EN-GB"" style="""">3. Why this materials and not cheaper materials?</span></strong></p>
<p><span lang=""EN-GB"" style="""">A: If I use cheaper materials the crowns will not get the perfect looking replica like I want to create. The synthetic stones have the perfect size from the original gems. And the other materials are selected to give the crowns the perfect look so it would looks like you see the real crowns.</span></p>
<p><strong><span lang=""EN-GB"" style="""">4. What will happened with the crowns after they are made?</span></strong></p>

The 4 crown project is a special project for me. I was thinking already longer to start this project. And now I start the project. Around the world there are not many good quality replica crowns. And especially not crowns you can rent! The original crowns are of course not to rent for anybody. The Dutch crown is normal locked up. And the three English crowns don’t leave the Tower of London. With this project I can make many dreams come true!
How will it be if you have a special party and you have this four amazing crowns on your party! Everyone will be jealous on you. How does he/she come to this 4 amazing crowns! You can’t even see by yourself the difference between the original or the replica. This is just one example where you can hire the crowns for! There are many other examples.
Before I could start the project I was searching what for kind of materials I want to use. And what is possible. I get advice from different silversmith’s. And they gived me good advice. After the advice I start searching on the internet for the materials. Is it possible how I want to make the crowns? And now I finished that part of the research. And yes it’s possible!
After the research I need a company that could help me with my project. On the start it wasn’t easy to find a company. But on 30-04-2013 we get in the Netherlands a new King. And they talked a lot about the crown and the company that made the crown for King Willem II. So I contact that company and they replied me they want to help me with this interesting project. The company name is: Bonebakker (based in Amsterdam http://www.bonebakker.nl/en). They made in 1840 the original crown from King Willem II.

The official draw of the crown for King Willem II in 1840 made by Bonebakker.
 
So now I know what for kind of materials I want to use. And I found a company that can help me. So I can start with my project! I made this page on Indiegogo to start my project. Of course I hope you all will support me to finish this great project and I can make the four high quality crowns.
 
The Company
After this four crowns are made what I want to do with the four crowns? After this crowns are made I want to start my own business in it. At the start I want to exhibite the crowns for a short time on different locations. After the exhibite people can rent the crowns from me. And I want to exhibite them on special events. When the crowns not be rented they will be showed in glasses showcases. There will also become a site where I will put all the information on when the crowns are made. People can see there all the rent information and what for special events I want to do. Will there be a market for renting the crowns? Yes there is! I researched a long time if there is a market for renting. I saw a lot of people that searched for crowns like this but they can’t find good quality crowns for renting.
 
The crowns
To make this crowns is an very expensive job. The crowns will be made with the best quality materials there are. When we reached the first goal we will start with the first crown.

Goal 1: The Dutch crown
The Dutch crown will be made with copper. On the copper we will put a chromium layer. And that will be gold-plated. For the glass stones in the original crown we will use synthetic stones. We use the synthetic stones to make the perfect look. For the pearls we use high quality imitation pearls. We do that because real pears are too expensive for it. We use this materials because this are the best materials to make the high quality replica crowns.

Goal 2: The Queen Mother’s crown
The Queen Mother’s crown will be made with copper. On the copper we will put a chromium layer. And that will be platinum-plated. For the diamonds in the original crown we will use synthetic stones. We use the synthetic stones too make the perfect look. For the ermine band we use imitation ermine. Because that’s more animal friendly. We use this materials because this are the best materials to make the high quality replica crowns.

Goal 3: St. Edward’s crown
The St. Edward’s crown will be made with copper. On the copper we will put a chromium layer. And that will be gold-plated. For the gems and diamonds in the original crown we will use synthetic stones. We use the synthetic stones to make the perfect look.  For the golden beads in the original crown we use gold-plated beads. We use the golden-plated beads too make the perfect look. For the ermine band we use imitation ermine. Because that’s more animal friendly. (In this crown they used also a bit platinum we will use that also to make it perfect.) We use this materials because this are the best materials to make the high quality replica crowns.

Goal 4: The Imperial State crown
The Imperial State crown will be made with copper. On the copper we will put a chromium layer. And that will be platinum-plated.  For the gems and diamonds in the original crown we will use synthetic stones. We use the synthetic stones to make the perfect look.  For the pearls we use high quality imitation pearls. We do that because real pears are too expensive for it. . For the ermine band we use imitation ermine. Because that’s more animal friendly. (In this crown they used also a bit gold & silver we will use that also to make it perfect.) We use this materials because this are the best materials to make the high quality replica crowns.
 
I need your help
Without your help I can’t make the high quality replica crowns. This means:

I can’t make my dream project come true.
I can’t make the crowns.
I can’t start my own business.
Other people can’t have pleasure from the good looking crowns.

By backing me now, you will help me to make my dream project come true! And more special I will be the first person that can let you rent the Dutch crown! I will go to special events to show people the great look of the special crowns! So you will not only helping me but you give also a big pleasure to a lot of people.
 
Where will your funding go?
All the donations goes straight to the crowns. We need all the money for:

The materials – We need a lot of materials for every crown so that will already be very expensive.
The silversmith – He make the crowns for me. I can’t make the crowns on my own.
Indiegogo fee – We need to pay a small fee to Indiegogo.

 
Use of funds
To make the dream project come true I need your help. I made an easy goals list where you can see how much I need for every crown. (The money behind the crown is just for 1 crown.)

 
What will I do if I not reach my goal?
Get me to €20.000,- and I can make the great replica of the Dutch crown.
Get me to the next €30.000,- and I can make the great replica of the Queen Mother’s crown.
Get me to the next €30.000,- and I can make the great replica of the St. Edward’s crown.
Get me to the next €30.000,- and I can make the great replica of the Imperial State crown.
If I don’t reach the next goal I need don’t worry! I safe the money for later. If I can’t make all the four crowns when the days for the project are over. I will make an following project. And I safe the money I already have for the first goal I want to reach with the following project. Till I get the for crowns.
 
The perks
When you will help me to make my dream project come true you can choose one of the perks. This is what you get in exchange for your help. You can see the perks on the right side from this page.
Like you can see I will do a lottery. This lottery will only become reality if we reached all the 4 goals. After the 3th goal will be reached I will make a update where you all can see what the prices will be for the lottery. And I am sure you will have more like 1 ticket for it!
 
The €35,- perk is the very special Limited Edition perk. Just 50 people van get this perk! Be fast before you are to late! The e-mail will be send from the same e-mail adress like all other e-mails. The e-mail is real from the Prince of Nottingham. He will give you a special 'Thank you' for a great contribute at this project.

FACs
1. Why are the English crowns more expencive to make like the Dutch crown?
A: For the english crowns we need more materials. They used in the English crowns more gems and other materials like in the Dutch crown.
2. What are synthetic stones?
A: Synthetic stones are human made stones. They become from a laboratory.
3. Why this materials and not cheaper materials?
A: If I use cheaper materials the crowns will not get the perfect looking replica like I want to create. The synthetic stones have the perfect size from the original gems. And the other materials are selected to give the crowns the perfect look so it would looks like you see the real crowns.
4. What will happened with the crowns after they are made?
A: At the start I want to exhibite them for a short time on different locations. After that nearly everyone can rent the crowns from me. And I want to show the crowns on special events.
5. I don't live into the Netherlands can i rent the crowns?
A: Yes, It's possible. But for that information you need to wait till the crowns are made.

<p><em>I've spent the last six years or so trying to find the best way of learning a secondary language.</em> While there are many great ways of building vocabulary, memorizing conjugations and all-around filling your mind with useful information, <strong>absolutely nothing</strong> beats the experience and acquisition of knowledge that can be accomplished by talking to a native speaker.</p>
<p>Whether you're starting out in your secondary language, almost fluent, but need more practice or you just need someone to talk to so you don't lose it, <em><strong>Lingua Parla is your solution.</strong></em></p>
<p>After registering, a person must simply fill out the information about what language they can speak and the language they want to learn or otherwise practice, and they will be matched to someone with whom they can practice.</p>
<p>In addition to matching with specific people, a user will be able to search the chat rooms for someone to practice with and strike up a conversation at their own consent.</p>
<p><strong>Your payment to the other person is time: </strong>The person to whom you are talking is also there to learn a second language (<em>we matched them to you because you speak the language they want to learn</em>). Each conversation will last 15 minutes, 30 minutes, an hour or whatever the two people agree on. Half will be spent speaking in one language and the second half in another (a soft alarm will go off when it's time to switch).</p>

<p><strong>Lingua will offer multiple facets.</strong> The main one will be video chat because it's easier to understand people and learn given facial expressions and hand gestures. However, Lingua Parla will also offer voice and text chat for those without a webcam or suitable internet connection.</p>
<p>The best way to learn a language is to go to a country that speaks it and immerse yourself in the language. That option is not available to most people, and the aim of every language learning software is to <strong>find the next best thing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lingua Parla, of course, is Italian for ""The Tongue Speaks""</strong>. Lingua itself is also understood as tongue by most people around the world.</p>
<p>$2500 (in addition to the time and money I'm investing) is the bare minimum to get this started (cost of servers). However, <strong>the long-run cost is in the tens of thousands</strong> of dollars. Any donations after reaching the initial $2500 are greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Even if you can't contribute financially, please consider sharing the project on any social media platform and telling people how cool it is. The more people we can behind this the better! </p>

<p>Hey there! I'm Jim Myers: Biker/Artist.  I've been into making art since the age of 2.  Really! I started drawing at around age 2.   I started painting at about age 14.  That's also the age I became passionate about motorcycles!  I decided to dedicate myself to the creation of art, seriously, about 10 years ago.  I'll admit it! I want to make a decent living at it.  </p>
<p>My idea, here, is to raise the funds to supply my studio with enough canvases and good quality acryllic paints to continue producing my paintings of motorcycle life, hot rods, classic cars, and basically any kind of paintings that the people who seek my services are looking for.  Also, I'm trying to gather up the funds to buy a small enclosed trailer, and a pro-panels set up so I can have a ""mobile gallery"" to take to bike shows, art shows, and <i>hopefully, </i>the Sturgis Bike Rally!</p>
<p>The folks who contribute to my campaign will be helping an artist who loves art more than anything achieve his dream of being a ""professional artist"".  And, for that, I would be eternally grateful!</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I'm looking to raise $10,000!  A major chunk of that will go toward the equipment I need to have myself a ""mobile gallery"" set-up to take my art to the people who would enjoy it the most.  Here's an approximate breakdown of where the money would go:</p></span></span><ul>
<li>Pro Panel display set-up and LED lighting kit:  Approx. $2100</li>
<li>6'x10' (or 12') enclosed trailer:  Approx. $3000</li>
<li>Canvases, paint, and other studio supplies:  Approx. $2000 - $3000</li>
<li>Throw a little in the bank so I can afford to go to shows:  Whatever's left.</li>
</ul>People who contribute wouldn't be ""throwing their cash to the wind"", so to speak.  I'll offer some pretty cool perks!  I make a Biker Art calendar that's pretty popular, at least among people I know.  I'll also offer prints, both unframed AND framed!  For those who want to contribute a lot of money, I'll even offer to do some original paintings of whatever they would like!<br/><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>My goal in life, as an artist, is to make people happy when they look at their walls!  I love doing paintings for people who want to memorialize someone, or remember something cool that they were part of, or a favorite vehicle ( motorcycle or car).  I also love doing art that represents the ""Biker"" lifestyle that I, and many other people, live and breathe everyday.  All my life, I've striven to make people happy.  I happen to believe that art does that very thing.  I'm also looking to start giving painting lessons to people, locally! <br/></p>

<h3>Introducing the A to Z of Caribbean Art</h3>
<p>For the past year, the team at Robert &amp; Christopher Publishers has been hard at work on our forthcoming art book: the <strong>A to Z of Caribbean Art</strong>. We're passionate about this project and its potential reach and longevity, and we're looking forward to your support in helping us to bring it to life.</p>
<p>The <strong>A to Z of Caribbean Art</strong> will offer a comprehensive, visual overview of the development of Caribbean art, from the beginning of the 20th century, to now. The <strong>A to Z</strong> will be a key resource of information on the greatest artists of the region. With artists listed alphabetically, instead of being grouped by traditional methods, this book will move seamlessly through artists and genres including drawing, painting, sculpture, photography, installation, and performance.</p>
<p>The <strong>A to Z</strong> will feature a short introduction by R&amp;C's editors, Melanie Archer and Mariel Brown, followed by the works. Each artist will be represented by a spread that will show a definitive work and will also provide biographical details on each artist: year of birth, year of death (if applicable), country of birth and residence, a 300-word statement about their oeuvre, and the name of the work that represents them, along with dimensions, medium and genres.</p>
<p>The artists who will be featured in the <strong>A to Z</strong> come from the English-, Dutch-, French- and Spanish-speaking Caribbean. We've chosen this illustrious group based on a number of factors, including critical discourse around their work, inclusion in a significant publication, work written about in regional or international trade magazine, and participation in a curated exhibition at a major institution, or at a regional or international biennial. </p>

<h3>Where We're At</h3>
<p>We have completed about 50% of the research involved in making a seminal book such as the <strong>A to Z of Caribbean Art</strong>. We’ve built extensive artists’ lists, reached out across the islands to advisors, compiled our list of contributing writers, and hired a researcher. We have a designer on board, we're actively seeking sponsorship; we’ve got print quotes and a marketing plan. We are so close to our April 2018 publication date, but we need to raise our printing costs to publish this book.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>One of our missions at Robert &amp; Christopher is to produce books at an accessible price point. In order to do this, we need to fundraise to partly cover our production and printing costs. With your contribution, we will be able to keep the price of <strong>A to Z</strong> within a range that will be affordable to a wide market that includes students. This price, along with the accessibility of the subject matter, solid editing and writing, and beautiful design, will make this a book everyone will want to have in their libraries. With your support, we will also be able to ensure posterity, and that this title will be highly visible through the Caribbean and internationally, thereby helping to raise the profile of regional art and artists.</p>
<p>We’re using the Indiegogo platform for both fundraising and as an opportunity to offer advance orders of the <strong>A to Z of Caribbean Art</strong>.  Your contributions can come in several forms:</p>
<p>1. Advance order(s) of A to Z<br/>2. Advance order(s) with added perks<br/>3. Perks<br/>4. Donations</p>
<p>We've developed some fantastic perks for your contributions; we're particularly thrilled to have teamed up with some of the Caribbean's most exciting artists – who will be included in the book – to offer highly collectible works of art. Other perks include advance orders of <strong>A to Z</strong>, and items that art and book lovers would enjoy like postcard packs, tote bags, R&amp;C's former titles, sketchbooks, and more!  Scroll down to the bottom of the campaign homepage to see our perks.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>While the <strong>A to Z of Caribbean Art</strong> is Caribbean-focused, it was born out of a spirit of mass appeal. In conceiving this book, we realised that it would be desirable to a broad range of people across many divides. Its Caribbean focus naturally creates an audience within this region, but also makes it a valuable collector’s item within the large and growing circle of international art players who have been increasingly keen to absorb the Caribbean’s artistic output.</p>
<p><strong>The A to Z of Caribbean Art will appeal to</strong>:<br/>Artists<br/>Art lovers <br/>Art collectors<br/>Art administrators<br/>Caribbean art institutions (museums and galleries)<br/>International art institutions (museums and galleries)<br/>Caribbean students (secondary, tertiary, and doctorate levels)<br/>Caribbean libraries<br/>Art scholars<br/>Professors and students of Caribbean studies<br/>Curators<br/>Designers<br/>Book lovers and collectors<br/>Art historians<br/>Writers and editors<br/>Culture lovers</p>
<p>At Robert &amp; Christopher, we believe in the power of documentation and connection. Our books (and the launches and talks around them) have led to meaningful and lasting artist connections and collaborations. They've been vessels for discourse and dialogue on Caribbean art, and have created further publication and exhibition opportunities for our artists. Among these, in 2014 we were invited to co-curate an exhibition, “<strong><a href=""https://scotiabankcontactphoto.com/archive/2014/primary-exhibition/shipping-containers-behind-the-power-plant-contemporary-art-gallery-pictures-from-paradise-a-survey-of-contemporary-caribbean-photography"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Pictures from Paradise</a></strong>,” with Wedge Curatorial Projects in Toronto, Canada, as part of the annual CONTACT Photography Festival – the largest public photography festival in the world. We're also the first Caribbean imprint to have a title distributed by<strong> <a href=""http://www.artbook.com/9789769534476.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Distributed Art Publishers</a></strong>. These advancements came out of pure dedication and a tremendous love for art, as well as our desire to do our part to help ensure posterity. With your help, we will keep pushing for quality visibility for Caribbean art and artists.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>In 2010 artists Hernan Barros and Omar Castañeda founded the <strong>'Food Of War'</strong> Collective.</p>
<p>The<strong> ‘Food of War’</strong>  Collective is dedicated to exploring the relationship between Food and Conflict through art. It is a Non-Profit initiative whose aims include creating art and events raising awareness about the impact of armed conflicts around the world. <strong>‘Food of War’</strong> develops art, cultural and community projects using food to bond with the audience and relay our message.</p>
<p>Since 2010 <strong>‘Food of War’</strong> have been travelling around the world, exploring conflicts and political circumstances where food plays a key role. The collective have exhibited in Spain, Germany, Ukraine, Mexico, Peru, Brazil and The United Kingdom, working with subjects as diverse as the Venezuelan Crisis and the 30th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster and as guests in several international art fairs.</p>
<p>Throughout these projects, <strong>‘Food of War’</strong> has collaborated with local artists on exhibitions, growing with their perspective and knowledge. Working with the community is an integral part of the collective's art practice, involving not only artists but also social causes related to the themes.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>'Food Of War' in post-conflict Colombia</h3>
<p>The founders of <strong>'Food of War'</strong> are both Colombian immigrants living in London. Returning to their native Colombia this project marks the peak of an intense cycle. Barros and Castañeda feel an urgency to work with their home country especially in this turbulent political moment where the peace treaty of 2016 is under threat.</p>
<p><strong>’Food of War’</strong> in Colombia marks the beginning of a new journey where the Collective and guest artists will be fuelled by the complexity of their home country and its history of food related conflict as well as its initiatives to bring healing and empowerment through working with food.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The relationship between Food &amp; Conflict in Colombia</h3>
<p>Colombia is one of the most resource rich and biodiverse countries on the planet. With an economy based on exportation of natural resources including oil, flowers and gold, Colombia has for centuries endured conflict connected to land distribution and exploitation of raw materials and those who have cultivated them.</p>
<p>Ranked in the top four for inequality, Colombia’s conflict has been tied to the misallocation of natural resources including crops, water and land. Food has been a key issue, connected to the structural lack of support for local farmers, the presence of paramilitary and guerrilla factions controlling large areas of land and furthermore the eradication programmes using biological warfare to eradicate plantations with the long-term affect of ruining soil and food crops.</p>
<p>With the signing of a Peace Treaty in 2016, food has become the path to leave behind the war and embrace a new era in harmony not only with the environment but with each other. Initiatives to embrace new crops, innovative ways of trading and engaging with a global economy are a few of the strategies related to food as the route to leave the illegality and build a new Colombia. What once was the root of conflict, is now the reason to embrace peace.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>We need your help</h3>
<p>Due to Colombia’s recent history of conflict, its national institutions do not have funding to financially support such a project. Therefore the invited artists have been asked to raise support internationally to realise this exhibition.</p>
<p>This exhibition could have an enormous impact on its audience. Highlighting narratives of post-conflict Colombia whilst helping people to understand the political nuanced history of the country this exhibition seeks to empower and educate in an accessible and inspiring way.</p>
<p>The attention on Colombia is too often associated with its narco-history. This exhibition will show an international audience another narrative and forge new collaborations with Colombian artists and communities across Colombia.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are raising £30,000 in order to:</p>
<p>What we need your contribution for:</p>
<p><br/>1. Developing workshops for the community affected by the conflict in Colombia. This will<br/>include indigenous communities from the Amazon, displaced people by the conflict, the<br/>trans community in Bogota and migrants from Venezuela.<br/>2. To help with the cost of artwork produced by the community together with the artists.<br/>3. To organised talks that will create a space for dialogue between the community and artists.<br/>4. To organise a gastroperformace inviting the community on the opening day.<br/>5. To invite other local collectives and ngos to display their work with vulnerable groups.</p> <p>For those who cannot experience the exhibition in Colombia, the <strong>Food of War Collective</strong> are organising a beauty pageant in London based on the themes of the exhibition with costumes exploring Food which has arisen from conflict. Tickets are included in the perks section. The event reflects the Colombian obsession with pageants and offers a vibrant evening of entertainment and learning about the subject of the exhibition. The winner of pageant will be invited to exhibit their costume in the next <strong>Food of War</strong> exhibition. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Our Track Record</h3>

In 2010 artists Hernan Barros and Omar Castañeda founded the 'Food Of War' Collective.
The ‘Food of War’  Collective is dedicated to exploring the relationship between Food and Conflict through art. It is a Non-Profit initiative whose aims include creating art and events raising awareness about the impact of armed conflicts around the world. ‘Food of War’ develops art, cultural and community projects using food to bond with the audience and relay our message.
Since 2010 ‘Food of War’ have been travelling around the world, exploring conflicts and political circumstances where food plays a key role. The collective have exhibited in Spain, Germany, Ukraine, Mexico, Peru, Brazil and The United Kingdom, working with subjects as diverse as the Venezuelan Crisis and the 30th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster and as guests in several international art fairs.
Throughout these projects, ‘Food of War’ has collaborated with local artists on exhibitions, growing with their perspective and knowledge. Working with the community is an integral part of the collective's art practice, involving not only artists but also social causes related to the themes.
 
'Food Of War' in post-conflict Colombia
The founders of 'Food of War' are both Colombian immigrants living in London. Returning to their native Colombia this project marks the peak of an intense cycle. Barros and Castañeda feel an urgency to work with their home country especially in this turbulent political moment where the peace treaty of 2016 is under threat.
’Food of War’ in Colombia marks the beginning of a new journey where the Collective and guest artists will be fuelled by the complexity of their home country and its history of food related conflict as well as its initiatives to bring healing and empowerment through working with food.
 
The relationship between Food & Conflict in Colombia
Colombia is one of the most resource rich and biodiverse countries on the planet. With an economy based on exportation of natural resources including oil, flowers and gold, Colombia has for centuries endured conflict connected to land distribution and exploitation of raw materials and those who have cultivated them.
Ranked in the top four for inequality, Colombia’s conflict has been tied to the misallocation of natural resources including crops, water and land. Food has been a key issue, connected to the structural lack of support for local farmers, the presence of paramilitary and guerrilla factions controlling large areas of land and furthermore the eradication programmes using biological warfare to eradicate plantations with the long-term affect of ruining soil and food crops.
With the signing of a Peace Treaty in 2016, food has become the path to leave behind the war and embrace a new era in harmony not only with the environment but with each other. Initiatives to embrace new crops, innovative ways of trading and engaging with a global economy are a few of the strategies related to food as the route to leave the illegality and build a new Colombia. What once was the root of conflict, is now the reason to embrace peace.
 
We need your help
Due to Colombia’s recent history of conflict, its national institutions do not have funding to financially support such a project. Therefore the invited artists have been asked to raise support internationally to realise this exhibition.
This exhibition could have an enormous impact on its audience. Highlighting narratives of post-conflict Colombia whilst helping people to understand the political nuanced history of the country this exhibition seeks to empower and educate in an accessible and inspiring way.
The attention on Colombia is too often associated with its narco-history. This exhibition will show an international audience another narrative and forge new collaborations with Colombian artists and communities across Colombia.
 
What We Need & What You Get
We are raising £30,000 in order to:
What we need your contribution for:
1. Developing workshops for the community affected by the conflict in Colombia. This willinclude indigenous communities from the Amazon, displaced people by the conflict, thetrans community in Bogota and migrants from Venezuela.2. To help with the cost of artwork produced by the community together with the artists.3. To organised talks that will create a space for dialogue between the community and artists.4. To organise a gastroperformace inviting the community on the opening day.5. To invite other local collectives and ngos to display their work with vulnerable groups. For those who cannot experience the exhibition in Colombia, the Food of War Collective are organising a beauty pageant in London based on the themes of the exhibition with costumes exploring Food which has arisen from conflict. Tickets are included in the perks section. The event reflects the Colombian obsession with pageants and offers a vibrant evening of entertainment and learning about the subject of the exhibition. The winner of pageant will be invited to exhibit their costume in the next Food of War exhibition. 
 
Our Track Record
We have curated 10 critically acclaimed international exhibitions in public and private institutions. The impact of these projects has been enormous with over 6000 visitors at our Chernobyl Commemoration Exhibition in Kiev and over 20,000 collectively over all of our shows. We have worked with over 60 international artists and run over 100 workshops engaging with groups varying from refugees, conflict victims and survivors, immigrants, internally displaced people, children, elderly communities and general art audiences.The power of our projects is far reaching. With each project we have created we have been approached by new institutions asking us to bring new developments of 'Food of War' to their countries.
For us as Colombians this new project is particularly important, however because Colombia is outside of the EU it is particularly different to get public funding for. This is why we really need your support. 
 

Risks & Challenges
Curating an exhibition in a post-conflict country certainly has its challenges. However, our collectives strong ties with Colombia and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Bogotá means we have a very strong support network and are extremely confident we can deliver this project to its full potential.

<p>My mother, Feryal Abbasi-Ghnaim, is the leading Palestinian folk artist specializing in fabric and fiber arts in the United States. She is of the Nakba generation, who left Palestine in 1948 -- and has dedicated her over 50 year career in teaching young women of color the endangered art of Palestinian embroidery and traditional art that she learned from her mother and grandmother. She has worked nearly without pay, only on grant funds, for decades -- in order to teach her apprentices the skill of embroidering by hand. She has been funded and honored by countless organizations, including the Oregon Historical Society, Oral History Center of Cambridge, Oregon Folklife Network, National Endowment of the Arts and the Regional Arts &amp; Culture Council.

<p>As new generations of Palestinians are raised in diaspora, it is becoming more crucial than ever to document our endangered traditional art of embroidery, the designs, meanings, context and history. I would like to assist my mother in translating, transcribing and publishing a series of e-books that give voice to our matriarchal ancestors, document oral history, as well as preserve the sacred tradition of Palestinian storytelling.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h3>My Story</h3><p>For over 20 years, I have had this dream – to create a female figure, a Modern Athena, at the scale of Michelangelo’s David. It seemed impossible, but in 2014, a friend from Georgia made me a unique offer. As part of an exchange for web services, he would pay me with a thousand pounds of Italian marble and alabaster. I accepted. I bought a set of steel chisels that were gathering dust in an art store, watched some instructional YouTube videos, and went to work teaching myself how to carve. When you’ve thought about something as long as I have, and you finally sit down to do it, it just flows out. In 2016, I spent a month in the city of Artists, the town of Pietrasanta, Italy, where Michelangelo himself once worked. There, I purchased proper carbide chisels, diamond rasps, and over 4,000 lbs of statuario marble - and had everything shipped back to Chicago.</p><p>The Modern Athena sculpture is to be seen as a symbol of female strength, beauty and wisdom - a modern woman. In the age of the “#MeToo” movement, female identity and power have emerged as fronts for social change. This large scale sculpture embraces our changing social dynamics in the hopes that the turmoil of change will eventually beget mutual prosperity. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1573500617/vv7lmzo9icnng2x97ezm.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3>Why I Need Your Support</h3><p>My project has qualified for a month-long residency in Athens, Greece this coming January. I have already completed a small scale model in clay that we cast into fiberglass to make it travel ready. In Athens, I will be working with a team of people to figure out the logistics of a 17 foot tall sculpture. I need to figure out answers to questions like, where will it go? how should it be exhibited? what is a sensible budget? and timeline? etc.</p><p>I am currently working on a four foot version in statuario marble from a 2,000 lb block. </p><p>My goal is to raise $5,500 to cover:</p><p>Residency fees, travel expenses and food for the month. If additional funds are raised, I will be able to visit Italy and purchase more marble from the quarries in Carrara and have it shipped back to America. It took me nearly 3 years to use up the marble I purchased in 2016 in Italy. I have a wonderful series of wings that I carved and figurative artworks. I'm now left with 1 block of marble that is being used for the four foot version of the Modern Athena. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1573506016/zqnnvzkvgafixiw2bkfu.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3>About the Artist Residency in Athens</h3><p>The Athena Standards Residency is a month-long studio artist residency program in the bustling metropolis of Athens, Greece. I feel that my professional development is integral to the Athena Standards Residency program. I look forward to having a shared studio space and working with art historian and curator Elizabeth Plessa and the rest of her team on my project. There will be scheduled studio visits, galleries of interest, openings, and museum shows. ASR also provides space for Athenian artists and recent graduates of the Athens School of Fine Arts, to encourage dialogue and collaboration between Greek artists and international artists-in-residence. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1573506750/gg5zsnzb6pmwrcucnyiz.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3>Modern Athena Details</h3><p>Why did I choose to focus on Athena? Female figures in sculpture are often rendered as either pious or sensual, but rarely as beautiful and strong women capable of defending themselves. Athena is one of the few goddesses in the Greek pantheon I really respect. She symbolizes wisdom, handicraft, and warfare but would wisely only go to war if absolutely necessary. I recently read that in her earliest renderings, Athena was either an owl herself or a bird goddess in general, neatly tying both my marble artwork series, wings and figures, together into one concept...</p><p><strong>HAIR</strong> - Traditionally, Athena wore an amulet of a Gorgon, the scary Medusa snake head that turns people into stone... as a symbol of protection. I wanted the hair to resemble snakes along with braids and dreadlocks... on the carved marble version, light will filter thru the gaps in the hair as the light of reason that protects.</p><p><strong>KNIFE</strong> - Growing up fishing, I always kept a knife on me, and in my solo travels in Europe and Asia, the tradition continued. When I lived in New Orleans during the evacuation for Hurricane Katrina, I had to entrust my favorite knife to a friend. She lost it, but a few months later a box appeared in the mail holding a Spanish Muela blade and a note...”There is a tradition in gift giving that requires the recipient of a knife to reciprocate with the gift of a coin. Presumably, this protects the strings of friendship from being cut by the blade.” Sadly, I let the friendship be cut and the knife sat for nearly a decade with a sheath maker. Last year when my friend took her life, my regrets deepened, and so the sculpture began with a gift that I didn’t appreciate until it was too late.</p><p><strong>STATUARIO MARBLE</strong> - Marble is never uniform in color, each type is quarried and mined from a particular part of the mountain and these veins often mix into each other. Statuario is prized because of its seemingly white uniformity, but upon closer inspection it is full of traces of color and warmth. The sculpture should be seen as a symbol of fusion that includes the entire spectrum of color. </p><p><strong>TATTOO</strong> - The human desire to take flight and abandon this earth-bound condition is timeless. Our progress in the last 100 years is breathtaking, and yet still hampered by age old corruption. By creating a figurative sculpture, I am referencing the dichotomies of the human condition. However, I’m including a wing as a symbol of hope. Highly polished Statuario marble resembles living flesh. This illusion of flesh will be accentuated by a wing tattoo on her back painted in Chinese ink. It will be an incomplete wing akin to an unfinished message. It is a message that must be discovered and finished by the viewers themselves. It is, after all, our shared story.</p><h3>Artwork Samples</h3><p>Here are samples of my drawings and sculptures, and photos of me at work in my Chicago studio to give a better idea of the start to finish process of carving a marble sculpture.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1573500819/wmzfh5v8wumhq2nzzgrv.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Viola of Twelfth Night, Remnants Series, hand carved statuario carrara marble and chinese ink, H 14.5 x W 6 x D 7 inches </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1573500861/oq7rwsyu2gxdiaoijmvr.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Goddess Flora, Pair of Limestone Statues, private commission, hand carved Indiana limestone H 76 x W 24 x D 18 inches</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1573507544/l6qxli4bqsfqfi2urdxy.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Original Charcoal Drawings: Bird Wing 40x60 inches Figure &amp; Fabric 30x80 inches</p><h3>Latest Press &amp; Website</h3><p>Here are links to my most recent press</p><p>“<a href=""https://www.luc.edu/features/stories/artsandculture/sculpture/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">In Michelangelo’s Footsteps</a>,” by Alan Wechsler, Loyola Magazine, August 2019<br/>“<a href=""https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/hinsdale/ct-dhd-column-clarkson-tl-0718-20190712-i35uhxw7ebg43dzybhfbnkkk64-story.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hinsdale Library to stage story of famous Shanghai sisters</a>,” by Sara Clarkson, Chicago Tribune, July 2019<br/>“<a href=""https://wgntv.com/2019/02/18/around-town-visits-workshop-4200/?fbclid=IwAR12Bg9lr2dLMiWU3J82rd3AfIB3rjtSUnWOZvNG8RqeIQxANnSCwoc8-s8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Around Town Visits Workshop 4200</a>,” by Ana Belaval, WGN9 News, 2019<br/>“<a href=""https://vimeo.com/264720010"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LIFTED</a>,” Documentary by Motion FilmWorks, 2018</p><p> See more artwork at <a href=""https://jylbonaguro.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">jylbonaguro.com</a></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>Sometimes you just can't afford to personally give.  I would be so grateful if you would consider helping out in these other ways too: </p><p>Get the word out and make some noise about my campaign</p><p>Share the link on your personal social pages</p><h3>Special Thanks</h3><p>To Andrea Mattson for being my muse, friend and model and to Ben Stroh for bearing with my passing out early on the couch from exhaustion for months and to all my friends and family I have neglected because of my absolute commitment to this dream of creating a sculpture at the scale of Michelangelo’s David.

If additional funds are raised, I will be able to visit Italy and purchase more marble from the quarries in Carrara and have it shipped back to America. It took me nearly 3 years to use up the marble I purchased in 2016 in Italy. I have a wonderful series of wings that I carved and figurative artworks. I'm now left with 1 block of marble that is being used for the four foot version of the Modern Athena. About the Artist Residency in AthensThe Athena Standards Residency is a month-long studio artist residency program in the bustling metropolis of Athens, Greece. I feel that my professional development is integral to the Athena Standards Residency program. I look forward to having a shared studio space and working with art historian and curator Elizabeth Plessa and the rest of her team on my project. There will be scheduled studio visits, galleries of interest, openings, and museum shows. ASR also provides space for Athenian artists and recent graduates of the Athens School of Fine Arts, to encourage dialogue and collaboration between Greek artists and international artists-in-residence. Modern Athena DetailsWhy did I choose to focus on Athena? Female figures in sculpture are often rendered as either pious or sensual, but rarely as beautiful and strong women capable of defending themselves. Athena is one of the few goddesses in the Greek pantheon I really respect. She symbolizes wisdom, handicraft, and warfare but would wisely only go to war if absolutely necessary. I recently read that in her earliest renderings, Athena was either an owl herself or a bird goddess in general, neatly tying both my marble artwork series, wings and figures, together into one concept...HAIR - Traditionally, Athena wore an amulet of a Gorgon, the scary Medusa snake head that turns people into stone... as a symbol of protection. I wanted the hair to resemble snakes along with braids and dreadlocks... on the carved marble version, light will filter thru the gaps in the hair as the light of reason that protects.KNIFE - Growing up fishing, I always kept a knife on me, and in my solo travels in Europe and Asia, the tradition continued. When I lived in New Orleans during the evacuation for Hurricane Katrina, I had to entrust my favorite knife to a friend. She lost it, but a few months later a box appeared in the mail holding a Spanish Muela blade and a note...”There is a tradition in gift giving that requires the recipient of a knife to reciprocate with the gift of a coin. Presumably, this protects the strings of friendship from being cut by the blade.” Sadly, I let the friendship be cut and the knife sat for nearly a decade with a sheath maker. Last year when my friend took her life, my regrets deepened, and so the sculpture began with a gift that I didn’t appreciate until it was too late.STATUARIO MARBLE - Marble is never uniform in color, each type is quarried and mined from a particular part of the mountain and these veins often mix into each other. Statuario is prized because of its seemingly white uniformity, but upon closer inspection it is full of traces of color and warmth. The sculpture should be seen as a symbol of fusion that includes the entire spectrum of color. TATTOO - The human desire to take flight and abandon this earth-bound condition is timeless. Our progress in the last 100 years is breathtaking, and yet still hampered by age old corruption. By creating a figurative sculpture, I am referencing the dichotomies of the human condition. However, I’m including a wing as a symbol of hope. Highly polished Statuario marble resembles living flesh. This illusion of flesh will be accentuated by a wing tattoo on her back painted in Chinese ink. It will be an incomplete wing akin to an unfinished message. It is a message that must be discovered and finished by the viewers themselves. It is, after all, our shared story.Artwork SamplesHere are samples of my drawings and sculptures, and photos of me at work in my Chicago studio to give a better idea of the start to finish process of carving a marble sculpture.Viola of Twelfth Night, Remnants Series, hand carved statuario carrara marble and chinese ink, H 14.5 x W 6 x D 7 inches Goddess Flora, Pair of Limestone Statues, private commission, hand carved Indiana limestone H 76 x W 24 x D 18 inchesOriginal Charcoal Drawings: Bird Wing 40x60 inches Figure & Fabric 30x80 inchesLatest Press & WebsiteHere are links to my most recent press“In Michelangelo’s Footsteps,” by Alan Wechsler, Loyola Magazine, August 2019“Hinsdale Library to stage story of famous Shanghai sisters,” by Sara Clarkson, Chicago Tribune, July 2019“Around Town Visits Workshop 4200,” by Ana Belaval, WGN9 News, 2019“LIFTED,” Documentary by Motion FilmWorks, 2018 See more artwork at jylbonaguro.comOther Ways You Can HelpSometimes you just can't afford to personally give.  I would be so grateful if you would consider helping out in these other ways too: Get the word out and make some noise about my campaignShare the link on your personal social pagesSpecial ThanksTo Andrea Mattson for being my muse, friend and model and to Ben Stroh for bearing with my passing out early on the couch from exhaustion for months and to all my friends and family I have neglected because of my absolute commitment to this dream of creating a sculpture at the scale of Michelangelo’s David.

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<strong> </strong>
<p>What Will We do to begin? </p>
<p><span><span><span><strong>In the Fall of 2013 The West 88 will begin operating with a project in Sweden that serves as a unique and progressive exploration of the collaboration between entertainment and health practices.</strong>  The premier focus is on creating mixed media and  cultural explorations, along with a unique theatrical culinary experience. Through the event we will address issues of income inequality in regard to food consumption, and the need for  an international food initiative similar to one started in Scandinavia:The Nordic Food Manifesto. Our Goal is to work with artists, chefs, and entrepreneurs in order to create a space that allows people to see the benefits of choosing and learning healthy food options by engaging with these practices in a fun and vibrant space. </span></span></span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong><span> </span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><span> </span></span></span>The project is set on a large scale. Since the last trip to Scandinavia in January of 2012, The West 88 has steadily been making progress in obtaining international sponsorship.</p>

<p><strong>The Team </strong></p>
<p><strong>ZELIS</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;""><strong>Hey, It's Zelis here.</strong> To understand The West 88 and my passion for gathering individuals it is vital I explain for you parts of myself. I was born in the now fallen city of Detroit, Michigan. Two days later I was adopted and taken to the bright San Francisco Bay Area to a quaint home at the end of a cul-de-sac that borders the main road into the city. <span style=""color: #000000;""><span>Karen Zelis,my Mother, a district attorney and single mother raised both my elder brother and I here. Though she was the only independent mother and woman of color on the block, she served as show runner of the neighborhood and outward community. She has facilitated countless block parties, holiday events, athletic gatherings, cultural celebrations, community rallies and more. From time spent with my mother I have learned: </span></span><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>to infuse creativity into ordinary or traditional activities, that to every problem there is a solution, and that any global goodness  begins in the community, between persons - a simple act of kindness. </strong></span></span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p align=""LEFT""><span style=""color: #000000;""> <span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">As my Mother knew the importance of inclusivity and community expansion, regardless of racial,gender,and social positioning; she encouraged this through the varying activities I was permitted to take on. I played in the boys youth baseball, basketball, and flag football leagues; competed in Odyssey of the Mind; performed in over twenty plays; danced tap and ballet; started a slam poetry group; explored passions in the kitchen; and took a year to develop a musical fundraiser in cooperation with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. At our home there have been over forty gatherings from my extracurricular activities alone. <strong>At an early age I learned that family is not about what we can hold together, but how we allow outside sources to permeate and influence the ever developing unit. </strong></span></span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p align=""LEFT""><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">As I developed I found the theater to be the outlet to focus my energy and passion. The theater was a temple in which darkness rose to reveal a restart and a renewal in the faith I carried in myself through the cultures, places, and people that became close to my heart, imagined through the theater. </span></span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p align=""LEFT""><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">I have studied theater at Center REP, Berkeley REP, The Interlochen Arts Academy, Stella Adler, Stonestreet Studios, and The Atlantic Theater Company. Regardless of approach there ar e two constants in the theater: When I enter it is empty, when the performance concludes, the space is again bare. But be it after the first performance, the fourth, or the fortieth- each time I enter that empty space, even if to the same sequence of events, I am released transformed. The theatrical structure allowed me at a young age to experience cause and effect in a controlled and compelling environment. </span></span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p align=""LEFT""><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">The West 88 has taken this concept but instead of putting on a play as a theater company may work to master, The West 88 creates original mixed medium experiences that constantly aim to connect individuals, expand our imagination in coordination with creating for every chosen problem a sustainable solution. </span></span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p align=""LEFT""><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">The West 88 is the accumulation of my love for the family and my calling and distinct passion for the theater.; it is an extension of my ever expanding and regenerative soul; a call for a progressive world, in which peace is the creative confrontation of social and economic deprivation within and between communities. </span></span></span></p>

<p> </p>
<p align=""LEFT""><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">Hey it's me, Leo. I had been in Nnew York City from my home country of Brazil for barely three weeks when I met Zelis at Washington Square Park. I was then invited to tap in The West 88 To Spring exhibition and from that point became very involved with the ideas and passions of The West 88. Let's take a few steps back: I grew up in Piracicaba with my mother, father, and three brothers. When I was six years old I took my first ballet class. A year later I began to tap, and would never stop. </span></span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p align=""LEFT""><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;""><span>Though Tap is a distinctly American art, I found many opportunities afforded to me in Brazil. I was able to receive a full scholarship to a rigorous private school that had not before been a viable option. When I was twenty-one I moved to Rio de Janeiro and began performing on the street. Through my corner performances I was interviewed on Programa do Jo ( a Brazilian David Letterman.) I was also offered and performed a part in the musical </span><em>La Cage Aux Folles</em><span>. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p align=""LEFT""><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;""><span>I have found myself able to forge connections and opportunities in America. I have attended various workshops in California, and was able to work with Jennifer Lopez, Marc Antony, and Jamie King on the American reality tv show </span><em>Que Viva.</em></span></span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">Being a part of The West 88 is the most natural expansion of my career as an artist. It is my dream to work with tap and continue to extend the medium as a tool for international and musical collaborations. Without tap dance, I have no idea where I would be, it has been essential in allowing me to live and promote global exchange. Through The West 88 I know I will continue to share my love for Brazil and remain open and active as a member of this global community.</span></span></span></p>

In the Fall of 2013 The West 88 will begin operating with a project in Sweden that serves as a unique and progressive exploration of the collaboration between entertainment and health practices.  The premier focus is on creating mixed media and  cultural explorations, along with a unique theatrical culinary experience. Through the event we will address issues of income inequality in regard to food consumption, and the need for  an international food initiative similar to one started in Scandinavia:The Nordic Food Manifesto. Our Goal is to work with artists, chefs, and entrepreneurs in order to create a space that allows people to see the benefits of choosing and learning healthy food options by engaging with these practices in a fun and vibrant space. 


 
 The project is set on a large scale. Since the last trip to Scandinavia in January of 2012, The West 88 has steadily been making progress in obtaining international sponsorship.
 
 
About
The West 88 believes that art in its most basic and original form is the gathering of a group of peoples to spread knowledge and motivate one another to action. The West 88 creates this architecture for opportunity by developing interactive performative exhibitions that form community, encourage social activism, and permit cross cultural, global exchange.
By fusing interdisciplinary and international work The West 88 highlights an ability to create a platform that knows no average or type. Rather it is bound by the belief that accessibility and inclusivity are key in order to create entertainment as a sustainable practice in uniting people with the resources they need to access their potential.

The Team 
ZELIS
 
Hey, It's Zelis here. To understand The West 88 and my passion for gathering individuals it is vital I explain for you parts of myself. I was born in the now fallen city of Detroit, Michigan. Two days later I was adopted and taken to the bright San Francisco Bay Area to a quaint home at the end of a cul-de-sac that borders the main road into the city. Karen Zelis,my Mother, a district attorney and single mother raised both my elder brother and I here. Though she was the only independent mother and woman of color on the block, she served as show runner of the neighborhood and outward community. She has facilitated countless block parties, holiday events, athletic gatherings, cultural celebrations, community rallies and more. From time spent with my mother I have learned: to infuse creativity into ordinary or traditional activities, that to every problem there is a solution, and that any global goodness  begins in the community, between persons - a simple act of kindness. 
 
 As my Mother knew the importance of inclusivity and community expansion, regardless of racial,gender,and social positioning; she encouraged this through the varying activities I was permitted to take on. I played in the boys youth baseball, basketball, and flag football leagues; competed in Odyssey of the Mind; performed in over twenty plays; danced tap and ballet; started a slam poetry group; explored passions in the kitchen; and took a year to develop a musical fundraiser in cooperation with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. At our home there have been over forty gatherings from my extracurricular activities alone. At an early age I learned that family is not about what we can hold together, but how we allow outside sources to permeate and influence the ever developing unit. 
 
As I developed I found the theater to be the outlet to focus my energy and passion. The theater was a temple in which darkness rose to reveal a restart and a renewal in the faith I carried in myself through the cultures, places, and people that became close to my heart, imagined through the theater. 
 
I have studied theater at Center REP, Berkeley REP, The Interlochen Arts Academy, Stella Adler, Stonestreet Studios, and The Atlantic Theater Company. Regardless of approach there ar e two constants in the theater: When I enter it is empty, when the performance concludes, the space is again bare. But be it after the first performance, the fourth, or the fortieth- each time I enter that empty space, even if to the same sequence of events, I am released transformed. The theatrical structure allowed me at a young age to experience cause and effect in a controlled and compelling environment. 
 
The West 88 has taken this concept but instead of putting on a play as a theater company may work to master, The West 88 creates original mixed medium experiences that constantly aim to connect individuals, expand our imagination in coordination with creating for every chosen problem a sustainable solution. 
 
The West 88 is the accumulation of my love for the family and my calling and distinct passion for the theater.; it is an extension of my ever expanding and regenerative soul; a call for a progressive world, in which peace is the creative confrontation of social and economic deprivation within and between communities. 
 

 
 LEO
 
Hey it's me, Leo. I had been in Nnew York City from my home country of Brazil for barely three weeks when I met Zelis at Washington Square Park. I was then invited to tap in The West 88 To Spring exhibition and from that point became very involved with the ideas and passions of The West 88. Let's take a few steps back: I grew up in Piracicaba with my mother, father, and three brothers. When I was six years old I took my first ballet class. A year later I began to tap, and would never stop. 
 
Though Tap is a distinctly American art, I found many opportunities afforded to me in Brazil. I was able to receive a full scholarship to a rigorous private school that had not before been a viable option. When I was twenty-one I moved to Rio de Janeiro and began performing on the street. Through my corner performances I was interviewed on Programa do Jo ( a Brazilian David Letterman.) I was also offered and performed a part in the musical La Cage Aux Folles. 
 
I have found myself able to forge connections and opportunities in America. I have attended various workshops in California, and was able to work with Jennifer Lopez, Marc Antony, and Jamie King on the American reality tv show Que Viva.
 
Being a part of The West 88 is the most natural expansion of my career as an artist. It is my dream to work with tap and continue to extend the medium as a tool for international and musical collaborations. Without tap dance, I have no idea where I would be, it has been essential in allowing me to live and promote global exchange. Through The West 88 I know I will continue to share my love for Brazil and remain open and active as a member of this global community.

<h3>ZEPPELIN LZ-13 / ART CAR / BURNINGMAN 2013</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are Anne Staveley and Steve Dulfer, mixed media artists and entrepreneurs living in Santa Fe, New Mexico. We work in metal, photography, fabric, and any other bits and pieces that catch our fancy. </p>
<p>We've got a plan to fly a zeppelin around the Playa at Burning Man 2013 and with your help, it might just work!</p>
<p>Our dream is to mutate a battered old golf cart into a miniature airship and dive into the tremendous outpouring of creativity that blooms in Nevada's Black Rock Desert for one week each year.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em><strong>Steve:</strong> </em> </p>
<p>For me, this is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to bring an art car to my first time at Burning Man.  Zeppelins have fascinated me since I was a kid.  They were so big, so fragile, so foolishly flammable!  Building one, even if it's a little one, is something I've always wanted to do.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em><strong>Anne:</strong> </em> </p>
<p>It's about the magic of taking something from my imagination, and then seeing it there in front of me.  It's a fantasy object-it's like science fiction coming to life. I'm inspired to create all the details-the upholstery, the dials, the wheels.  I'm excited for the adventures we'll find along the way..</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here it is in living color (or is it black and white?):</p>
<p>We're raising $3500 to make our long-suffering golf cart (Yolanda) live again, turn it into a miniature illuminated (and thoroughly non-flammable) zeppelin, transport it from Santa Fe to Nevada's Black Rock Desert, and bring it safely home again.  Specifically, we need batteries and tires for the cart.  We need steel, plywood, fabric, upholstery foam, construction supplies,and lots of cool lighting for  Yolanda's zeppelin hat.</p>
<p>Since we're both artists, we're offering original art as rewards for your participation in our project.  Signed photographs from the Playa, commemorative LZ-13 stainless steel necklaces, and even Zeppelin belt buckles.  Also, for a lucky few, sunset champagne cruises aboard LZ-13 herself.  Check out the full description ON RIGHT.</p>
<p>We're really committed to bringing our zep to Burning Man 2013--we've been planning the project for over a year.  So we'll invest every cent you donate towards making it happen, even if we don't reach our goal of $3500.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We want LZ-13 to be a creation of whimsy and of beauty, and for her to inspire curiosity, delight, and cameraderie.  And in appreciation for your support, we'd like to share her with you.</p>
<p>We can make this happen.  We've supported ourselves as artists and entrepreneurs for more than ten years. We're excited and we're ready. </p>
<p>As crowdfunding proposals go, ours is pretty modest.  And yet, without your donations, it just won't happen.  Help us turn our magical dream into reality and LZ-13, fleeting illusion that she is, will touch the lives of hundreds of people in real ways that we can't even begin to predict.</p>
<p> </p>

<p class=""p1"">Every artist has a process that brings them from the birth of an idea to the completion of a work. Many movement artists utilize objects as tools to inspire their movement, then later discard these objects and let the movement reign.

This show celebrates those objects and the contribution they have brought to the creation of this series of performance-based works.</p>
<p class=""p2""><br/></p>
<p class=""p1"">Object as Performer will be a two-night performance and gallery show in Brooklyn, NY with performance, video and installation work by Rebecca Davis, MartÃ­n Lanz, Abigail Levine, Juri Onuki, The A.O. Movement Collective, Nina Schwanse and Felisia Tandiono.</p>

<p><strong>Totem, Notem, Tonem</strong> is a giant 20 foot tower with magical hidden compartments of spirit animal wonders inside and out! A large stack of vintage luggage compiles to make the totem tower. The totem is adorned with portals, cranks, gears, sprockets, springs,a gold bird with wind propelled wings, and a helix corkscrew wind chime chandelier on the inside is as much interactive as it is thought-provoking. The sculpture is colorfully scrolled with wood carvings of spirit animals from the Pacific Northwest which signify its meaning of reconciliation between man and mother earth. The sculpture towers over an observer while compelling one to crawl inside to sit within the ambiance of the sculpture and listen to the beautiful chimes during the day. Totem, Notem, Tonem at night becomes eerie and fierce as the eyes of the spirit animals are illuminated and the interior of the sculpture flickers with candles of mysticism. As you can see below, because of the amazing crew and Priscilla's relentless desire to create a sacred space within a sculpture it is well worth the time, effort, and donation.</p>

<p>This colorfully scrolled art piece is an honorarium project for Burning Man, 2013, which means that it received a grant for approximately 50% of the cost of the project. The artist is expected to fundraise the additional money needed to bring the project to the desert in August of 2013, which is why we are reaching out to you! The great news is that the project has been able to use reclaimed materials whenever possible during construction. Therefore, the money raised now is for paint, the convex glass windows, and transportation.</p>
<p>This awesome sculpture is like a totem pole, jack-in-the-box, music box so if you make it to Burningman this year please crawl inside the sculpture and sit around the fire with us as we gaze up at the moving gears and pulleys and listen to the amazing chime chandelier…<br/><br/>Thank you Bunches for taking the time to consider supporting this project. We believe it takes a village to make good art and because of that at any level of donation we will engrave your name or a loved one's name of your choice onto the ceiling of the sculpture. Everyone visiting the art piece will see all who gave and allowed the sculpture to come to fruition. We apologize for the lack of video but we are putting all our energy into getting this sculpture built and on the playa. We believe the images are breath taking enough and we know it will be enjoyed.</p>
<p>The sculpture will be complete by the end of July and transported the second week of August. The crew is putting just as much love into the sculpture as into the donation swag. So enjoy which ever art piece swag you end up with.</p>

<p>I have been living, working and making art in Western Massachusetts for over 8 years.  In my time here I have participated in solo and group shows and benefited immensely from the nurturing and supportive artist community.  For the last two and a half years, I have worked as an arts administrator for a national arts service organization, in which I have developed as a professional while gaining a wider perspective on the arts.  My time in Western Mass has been incredibly valuable, but I feel it's time to move onto somewhere that I can fully realize my potential as an artist.<br/></p>
<p>I have received a <a href=""http://www.vermontstudiocenter.org/october-1-2012-vermont-studio-center-fellows/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Clowes Fellowship</a> to attend a month-long artist residency at the Vermont Studio Center, rising above hundreds of other applicants.  This residency will take place from September 29th-October 25th.  It will be a chance for me to live and breathe my artwork in a way I've never experienced before.  I will have my own private studio that I can work in 24 hours a day, and be surrounded by artists from all over the world.<br/></p>

My name is Perry Baron Huntoon and I am a painter moving to New York City!
I have been living, working and making art in Western Massachusetts for over 8 years.  In my time here I have participated in solo and group shows and benefited immensely from the nurturing and supportive artist community.  For the last two and a half years, I have worked as an arts administrator for a national arts service organization, in which I have developed as a professional while gaining a wider perspective on the arts.  My time in Western Mass has been incredibly valuable, but I feel it's time to move onto somewhere that I can fully realize my potential as an artist.
I have received a Clowes Fellowship to attend a month-long artist residency at the Vermont Studio Center, rising above hundreds of other applicants.  This residency will take place from September 29th-October 25th.  It will be a chance for me to live and breathe my artwork in a way I've never experienced before.  I will have my own private studio that I can work in 24 hours a day, and be surrounded by artists from all over the world.
After my residency, I plan on moving to New York City, where there are infinite opportunities for artists: galleries, alternative spaces, residencies, the best museums in the world, and thousands of other serious artists.  
Professional Goals I hope to Realize in NYC:
Find day job(s) in which I am surrounded by art and/or art-making, i.e. art or museum education, or other work in a gallery, museum or alternative art space
Develop a network of New York-based artists with whom to collaborate and share resources
Participate in more artist residencies
Long-term: Be able to support myself, at least partially, through sales/commissions of my artwork


In November I will be staying with friends in Brooklyn while I look for an apartment, interview for jobs, scope out studio space, and meet other artists in the city.  My goal is to be employed and living in my own place by December 1st.
The money I am raising through this campaign will help me continue the momentum I develop during my residency and allow me the time to network and find opportunities that are in line with my goals as an artist.  Having financial security in the first month I'm in the city will be the first step to finding my niche in the Big Apple and growing my career.
Where's Your Money Going, and What do You Get?

The $3,000 you help me raise will match my current savings to go toward my November living expenses as well as professional development opportunities.
One Month of Living Expenses Includes:

This piece, entitled Turning Point, depicts two very disparate landscapes: the Arctic and the American Southwest, is acrylic on canvas and measures 30x36"".  I completed it in August of 2013 with this transition in the forefront of my mind.  The more you give, the more of my art you can own, like signed prints, postcards, and even custom paintings of your favorite place.  You even have the chance to consult with me on your very own custom landscape.  Take a look at some of the the goodies that could be yours:

In 2006, after completing my master’s degree in the fibers program at California State University, Long Beach, I moved to Boston Massachusetts, and since that time, I have been developing several new bodies of work, including the Leaf series and the Lacework series.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.jenineshereos.com/leaf_01.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong><em>The Leaf Series</em></strong></a></p>
<p>The leaf series was inspired by a collection of delicate leaf skeletons that I came across while hiking in northern California several years ago. In this work, I attempt to recreate the intricacies of a leaf’s veining using a system I developed by wrapping, stitching, and knotting together strands of human hair. I begin by stitching individual strands of hair by hand into a water- soluble backing material. At each point where one strand of hair intersects another, I stitch a tiny knot, so that when the backing is dissolved, the entire piece holds its form.</p>
<p>Creating this work is a very meditative process for me. I am attracted to the idea of transformation and the way that humble materials can be used to make something strangely beautiful and unexpected. The complex network of lines present in this work mimics the organic patterns found in nature and speaks to the natural systems of transformation, growth and decay. Allusions to the vascular tissue of plants, as well as the vascular system of the human body, exist simultaneously; the delicate trace of a hair falling silently, imperceptibly, from one’s head becoming the veins of a leaf as it falls from a tree leaving its indelible imprint on the ground below.</p>

<p>Another series I have been working on recently involves making lace patterns by tracing the shadows of trees. Recently, I have traced a number of tree shadows at Harvard’s Arnold Arboretum here in Boston.  As I sit down to draw the shadows, they are constantly shifting and in the course of the hour or two that it may take to capture a tree’s single shadow, numerous slips and shifts have occurred. I am interested in this process of attempting to capture something that is ultimately ephemeral. In the current phase of this project, I am exploring possible ways to interpret the information gathered by the tracings through various textile techniques.</p>
<p><strong><em><a href=""http://www.camac.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CAMAC</a></em></strong></p>
<p>In addition to my studio practice, for the past four years I have also been working full-time as a weaving teacher for adults with disabilities at Gateway Arts in Brookline MA. At Gateway, I assist artists as they work towards their goals in weaving and fiber arts. While I love my work at Gateway, balancing my own artistic practice with a full-time teaching position has been very challenging. I find myself longing for a quiet space outside of everyday life to reflect and create; and to reconnect with my own artistic practice.</p>
<p>This summer, I have been accepted for a month-long artist residency at the prestigious CAMAC Centre d'Art in Marnay-sur-Seine, France. Located in a small village just 60 miles outside of Paris, I will have the opportunity to focus on my artwork in the serene setting of the French countryside while also venturing into Paris to soak in artistic inspiration from the galleries and museums. During my time at CAMAC, I plan to continue work on the Leaf and Lacework series’ and also to begin developing new ideas. I eagerly anticipate this time of inspiration and reflection, and know that it will breathe new life into my creative process.</p>
<p>I am so excited about this opportunity, but I need your help to make it a reality! The funds raised on Indiegogo will go towards the cost of the residency program as well as transportation to and from France.

I've always been working with recycled wood from broken branches and dead trees. Carving spoons and bowls and sculptures.<br/>I love trees and got very much inspired by living and working in midst of nature.<br/>Really it's a dream realized. We never got rich, but it's a privilege to love my work.<br/>Since 3 years economic crisis in Spain is pushing me to find new horizons out there in the world. I've been travelling around Europe to find a new place to realize my creation and working here and there to make some money.<br/><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FpxGG0iywQWY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DpxGG0iywQWY&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FpxGG0iywQWY%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><b>When the fire came</b><br/>In August 2012 a big bushfire burnt many of the island's forest and came to our house burning down the bathroom and my workshop.

When we lose art, we lose our voice &amp; a means of creative expression.  I know how vital art was to me as a child. Being introverted, I was able to express myself through art. Presently, my art is shown in museums &amp; galleries &amp; published in numerous books plus has traveled to the Smithsonian &amp; around the world. I have conducted art workshops, demos &amp; taught at major universities, schools &amp; education facilities to all age levels-Children &amp; Adults.<br/></p>
<p>Art is a creative way to help children &amp; all ages to develop. When the arts leave the schools, life leaves the schools. <b>I plan to donate 500-1000 hours or more of my time to help the next generation. I want to give art back to the kids. My hope is to reach a diverse group of children from all backgrounds. I will travel to parks &amp; schools and/or rent spaces to teach art and invest in our kids. The schools can't pay for art for the kids but (you) the community can. I need your support. Don't let our art die. Where there is art, there is life.</b></p>
<p>I am seeking funding for art supplies for the kids, equipment such as a canopy if needed, portable tables, projector, art tools, frame supplies &amp; more, rental fees, travel, an assistant, snacks, promotional materials/flyers, printing &amp; copying, research and more. <br/></p>
</div>We know that visual art enriches a community. This enrichment comes with a price and the kids and I are counting on people like you to step forward to chip in. This Indiegogo campaign is a platform to generate funds no matter how big or small. Reaching our goal of $60,000 will aid in the life of this project and sustain my goal. To nurture this arts project is essential to our kids, our community and our future. We are turning to you, our strongest allies, to ask for help in realizing this goal. In  exchange for your support, as an artist I will generously provide incentives for your contribution. <i><b>Please scroll down to see an example of some of the perks</b></i>; *More perks may be added at Artist's discretion. <b>Like &amp; follow </b>me at <b><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/buenaartist"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.facebook.com/buenaartist</a></b> to see <b>your name</b> posted.<br/><br/>Also, please help to get the word out and make some noise about this arts campaign.

When we lose art, we lose our voice & a means of creative expression.  I know how vital art was to me as a child. Being introverted, I was able to express myself through art. Presently, my art is shown in museums & galleries & published in numerous books plus has traveled to the Smithsonian & around the world. I have conducted art workshops, demos & taught at major universities, schools & education facilities to all age levels-Children & Adults.
Art is a creative way to help children & all ages to develop. When the arts leave the schools, life leaves the schools. I plan to donate 500-1000 hours or more of my time to help the next generation. I want to give art back to the kids. My hope is to reach a diverse group of children from all backgrounds. I will travel to parks & schools and/or rent spaces to teach art and invest in our kids. The schools can't pay for art for the kids but (you) the community can. I need your support. Don't let our art die. Where there is art, there is life.
I am seeking funding for art supplies for the kids, equipment such as a canopy if needed, portable tables, projector, art tools, frame supplies & more, rental fees, travel, an assistant, snacks, promotional materials/flyers, printing & copying, research and more. 
We know that visual art enriches a community. This enrichment comes with a price and the kids and I are counting on people like you to step forward to chip in. This Indiegogo campaign is a platform to generate funds no matter how big or small. Reaching our goal of $60,000 will aid in the life of this project and sustain my goal. To nurture this arts project is essential to our kids, our community and our future. We are turning to you, our strongest allies, to ask for help in realizing this goal. In  exchange for your support, as an artist I will generously provide incentives for your contribution. Please scroll down to see an example of some of the perks; *More perks may be added at Artist's discretion.

<p>To me, as a lama, it's very important that Dharma not
be limited to an intellectual understanding acquired from books and teachers.
Dharma is a state of being. It is an experience. Experiencing the places where

blessings still remain, awakens your karmic propensities and boosts you to a

<div>Vancouver Island has an amazing graffiti community, although it lacks a sticker culture. In hosting this sticker, poster, and street art festival in Victoria, I hope to spark some interest in the community. </div>
<div>This is the first of hopefully what turns into an annual sticker, poster, and street art exhibition on Vancouver Island. As interest in the event grows, so does our vision. This will be an all ages event during <span style=""background-color: initial;"">he day with a 19+ atmosphere in the evening with live music and more!</span>
</div>
<div>By bringing in some well established local talent such as CHI NO &amp; Rizatek we hope to draw a crowd that may of once looked beyond the art on the walls, and have them engage in an interactive gallery, and meeting some of this city’s local talent.<br/>We live in a world where we are required to seek out what interests us. We also live in a time where self promotion is prominent. It is the responsibility of the artist to bring the art to the people, and here at the Slap Happy Sticker, Poster &amp; Street Art Expo, this is our ultimate goal!<br/><br/>***Unfortunately our partnering sponsor has moved locations and can no longer host the event.***</div>
<div> Due to these unfortunate circumstances we have been forced to seek out an alternative venue. Being that we still have 7 months until the show, we have decided to seek out a warehouse which will better suit our needs, allowing us little or no restrictions. There have been multiple promising locations recently visited, although without a Cash deposit we are living in a dream world. With your support we can help bring this dream world to reality.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>UPDATE: </div>
<div>We are happy to announce that our friends at OneSix Boardshop in Victoria BC have agreed to host a weekend long eventa The proposed plan includes some alterations to be done inside the shop, such as a temporary wall to divide the location into a store/gallery type setting which could operate indipendantly over the weekend.</div>
<div>A deposit of 50% is required to book the venue which is $600. Putting a deposit on this location is necessairy as soon as possible to prevent ending up in a situation with no venue once again.<br/><br/>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Vancouver Island has an amazing graffiti community, although it lacks a sticker culture. In hosting this sticker, poster, and street art festival in Victoria, I hope to spark some interest in the community. 
This is the first of hopefully what turns into an annual sticker, poster, and street art exhibition on Vancouver Island. As interest in the event grows, so does our vision. This will be an all ages event during he day with a 19+ atmosphere in the evening with live music and more!

By bringing in some well established local talent such as CHI NO & Rizatek we hope to draw a crowd that may of once looked beyond the art on the walls, and have them engage in an interactive gallery, and meeting some of this city’s local talent.We live in a world where we are required to seek out what interests us. We also live in a time where self promotion is prominent. It is the responsibility of the artist to bring the art to the people, and here at the Slap Happy Sticker, Poster & Street Art Expo, this is our ultimate goal!***Unfortunately our partnering sponsor has moved locations and can no longer host the event.***
 Due to these unfortunate circumstances we have been forced to seek out an alternative venue. Being that we still have 7 months until the show, we have decided to seek out a warehouse which will better suit our needs, allowing us little or no restrictions. There have been multiple promising locations recently visited, although without a Cash deposit we are living in a dream world. With your support we can help bring this dream world to reality.

UPDATE: 
We are happy to announce that our friends at OneSix Boardshop in Victoria BC have agreed to host a weekend long eventa The proposed plan includes some alterations to be done inside the shop, such as a temporary wall to divide the location into a store/gallery type setting which could operate indipendantly over the weekend.
A deposit of 50% is required to book the venue which is $600. Putting a deposit on this location is necessairy as soon as possible to prevent ending up in a situation with no venue once again.
   What We Need & What You Get The Break-Down
In
addition to the venue fees mentioned above, the cost of building a temporary wall for the show with a secure entrance into OneSix Boardshop and removing it one week later is estimated at apx $1500.


The night portions of the event will be 19+ as we intend on getting a liquor license. This will be a paid event, weekend passes or single night passes will be available,


The daytime portion of the expo will be free and accessible to all to come down and interact with, check out the vendors, demos and a chance to win free night passes to the 19+

  Risks & Challenges 
Planning this street art expo began as only a slight twinkle
in my eye not much more than two months ago. Now, I sit fully submersed in the
life of what I feel is a small enterprise. I have now come to the point where
it is more than a one man job.
Oct 6th - This
week I have teamed up with two other individuals who have committed to joining
a Slap Happy Committee to help share some of the tasks at hand.
Oct 13th - This week we are happy to announce that a local vinyl cutter has offered their services free of charge to help promote the expo.


**UPDATE** Oct 29th - A large prize pack was donated to us by Jupiter Smoke Shop allowing us to sell raffle tickets to help bring in some revenue. The raffle date is December 10th 2014, hoping the money raised may be used as a venue deposit in January.

***UPDATE*** Nov 29th -We are extreamly excited to announce that we have found a Venue for the show. A deposit must be paid ASAP to ensure we do not end up in a situation without a venue once again.  Ticket sales for the large prize pack are still under way, although they have slowed since the announcement of the draw.

Pieces and bits of this matrix of intersecting lines were then strewn underneath, like morphological leaves dropped to the ground, ready to be (re-)assembled or used elsewhere.  (heavy cotton rag paper; size of paper 15 x 21 cm, embossed print 11.5 x 16 cm).



Dennis is preparing a black & white photo from the eastern part of Aldabra Atoll, where the density of giant tortoises is so high that their grazing creates many tightly-cropped grass patches. Resembling a line of helmets, the tortoises move and mow across the turf. The photo will be printed with pigment inks on heavy cotton rag paper; Dennis is experimenting with various sizes of print and paper, and the final dimensions will be determined soon.

As a woman and professional wood designer I wanted to explore and create an intimate toy that was honest, aesthetically refined and above all natural.
When designing a sex toy, materials are an essential ingredient. Wood, along with all of its unique qualities was an obvious choice. With proper woodwork and a delicate finish it turns into an all natural sex toy, which will last you a lifetime. 

I aspire not only to design elegant, all natural sex toys but also to make them into distinct, artistic and personable bedroom accessories. I want to destigmatize and turn them into objects, which can be displayed as well as enjoyed. Sensual, erotic and natural. 






Woodwork design is a delicate craft. Production can be quite demanding and requires a lot of focus. My designs are plotted with precision, formed by hand and require multiple stages of careful sanding. Each piece and all of its details are finished by hand in my workshop.





Dee Lee Doo wooden toys are made of all-natural plantation wood. I carefully selected a variety of three local and three exotic wood types for you to chose from. Pick the one that suits you best.






As soon as I've reached the desired shape, each Dee Lee Doo dildo is finished with multiple layers of all-natural, environmentally-friendly, water thinned transparent varnish, free of solvents and wood preservatives, with a consistent selection of ecologically friendly raw materials. The process emphasises the wood color and structure but also forms a very thin layer, which protects the wood from damage, makes it waterproof and ensures long lasting quality of the dildo.





Each Dee Lee Doo sculpture embodies solid organic curves and thought-out ergonomic qualities. During the design process, I let my intuition guide me. You should certainly do the same when choosing one. Dimensions are guide only, size of each piece may vary slightly.




Dimensions: 5.5 x 1.2 in / 14.5 x 3 cm
A mini version of a Dee Lee Doo dildo.






Dimensions: 9.5 x 1.2 in / 24 x 3.5 cm
The first Dee Lee Doo design, which provoked the entire collection. Very simple, elegant, and the longest of them all. 







Dimensions: 8.3 x 1.6 in / 21 x 4 cm

The most realistic of my designs, particularly in terms of use and feel. It is narrow in the middle for a better grip. 






Dimensions: 9 x 1.6 in / 23 x 4 cm
This design is most in line with nature. It is smooth but a little unpredictable. 








Dimensions: 7.8 x 1.2 in / 20 x 3.5 cm
One of the straighter dildos I've designed. Its varying width creates a very stimulating double wave effect. 










Dimensions: 7.9 x 1.2 in / 21 x 3.5 cm
Beautiful organic design, open to sensual and imaginative use. Easy to handle and guaranteed to please.










Dimensions: 9 x 1.6 in / 23 x 4 cm
The most dynamic design in my collection, very pleasant to use. This one is very easy to handle due to its shape and extended tail, which makes it a great Christmas gift for women as well as men.










A dominant piece in my collection and the most popular bedroom toy besides the dildo. Beautiful ergonomic handle and eco-friendly faux leather falls. 









The dildos will be packaged in a locally sown satchel made of soft, all-natural wool. The finished product will also be protected with a carton tube and sent to your address, without revealing the contents of the package.







I've finish my studies and moving on onto the next stage in life. I've found my passion and am determined to pursue it. On top of this, I firmly believe in local, sustainable production and no compromises. With your support I'll be able to equip my shop with the necessary tools to continue my work efficiently, develop new dildo designs, explore new ideas and ensure use of only the best quality, natural and environmentally friendly raw materials. And of course, deliver your rewards on time :)




















I designed Dee Lee Doo dildos to be completely hygienic, non-allergenic and DIN certified safe to use. The surface finish is solid, smooth, water-safe and allows for easy and effective cleaning. The quality of the coating and the wood itself are of the highest standard and crafted with utmost precision, hence will not splinter or cause damage to skin if used without applying excessive force. After use, simply rinse the dildo with water and dry it off. With good care and proper maintenance wood can last forever. 
Despite full confidence in the safety of my designs, please use the dildos responsibly and at your own risk.

</div></div>","ABOUT ENDLESS EDITIONS
Endless began as a collaborative group exhibition in the summer of 2012, Endless Editions is the most current manifestation of this idea. We premiered this project in January of 2014 in an open call group show at Con Artist Collective.
We are a publishing project which editions and disseminates books and prints by artists irrespective of their background, career, gender, sexuality, age or work experience. 
During our first year, Endless Editions works have shown at Court Tree Collective, Mixed Greens Gallery, Printed Matter, Inc., Art Metropole, The Sculpture Center via Desert Island Comics, McNally Jackson and the New York Art Book Fair at MoMA PS1. Endless Editions books are catalogued at the Newark and New York Public Libraries. With six editioned titles, and an open-submission monthly periodical, Endless highlights the artist who we believe deserve recognition.
Endless uses Riso printing technology, a digital duplication format invented in Japan in 1986. Riso printing is an effective way of producing high volumes of prints or books. The images are similar to that of screenprinting with the efficeincy of a xerox printer. It is the perfect combination of digital and handmade printing. Riso's soy based ink and energy standards make Riso printing a clean and energy-efficient printing method.
CALL TO ACTION
Since its inception, Endless Editions has been funded by the personal investments of its founders. Beginning with the purchasing of a single Riso printer, Endless has since acquired several Riso and inkjet printers. Our mission is to make publishing more accessible to artists, meaning that costs related to publishing are covered by us. We wish to alleviate economic burden from artists and are asking you for support. This fundraiser will help Endless Editions to establish a budget for 2015 for the sake of producing and showcasing artworks.
2015 EDITIONS
In the next year we plan on producing several editions by artists such as Glen Baldridge and Kharis Kennedy among many others. But first we will be producing an abecedarian in two parts by Ashley May. The source material for these two books, ""A-M"" and ""N-Z"", is a GIF animation created by the artists. This GIF depicts a selection from her postcard collection, endlessly repeating in a circular motion. We have already begun the proofing process with Ashley May, and have decided that the book will not only display the animation, but will physically recreate the animation. We wish to produce an interactive book object.
      
Each book will contain 23 pages which read linearly, as a typical book does, displaying pictorial representations of letters A-M and N-Z. Each page will hinge to the page which precedes it with a custom tab, allowing the book to fan outward into a circular book object. Two distinct images are created based on how we have oriented the rotation of pages, and so this book will be produced in two versions. We are looking to raise funds for this project to build custom archival boxes for these book objects to live in.
ENDLESS AUDIO
Endless will be expanding the scope of our publishing practices by introducing multi-media works into our catalogue. Our first project will feature the group Intra Faction. With this group, we will be producing a media package within a custom USB drive attached to an art book. The drive will contain a brand new record release by the band, a music video containing footage from a secret show and photos. Endless Audio hopes to promote sonic works which may be overlooked by traditional record labels and music venues. Donations made to this fundraiser will offset the cost of creating customized items for this innovative release.
BOOK FAIRS AND EXHIBITIONS
We will be taking our editions with us to the Los Angeles Art Book Fair in January of next year. This will be our first appearance at the LA installment of this fair. We will potentially be traveling to Europe in May for a book fair in France. In both cases, we hope to find new audiences for our artists' work. Support will allow us subsidized travel expenses as that we can continue to promote our works.
Next year, we will also be potentially occupying a space in the NY/NJ area. If this happens, we will be creating our dream bookmaking shop, complete with a community bookstore and gallery space. We are asking for your support in helping us raise a budget for this community project.
SPRTS
We plan to continue producing SPRTS, our monthly periodical, next year. What began as a satirical, faux-editorial regarding the world of professional sports, has quickly turned into a platform for artists to share ideas. At this time, we sell enough copies of SPRTS each month to produce the next issue. Funding for this project will allow us to continue to make this magazine more sophisticated and bring its service to more artists.
BUDGET
We are looking to raise $20,000 during this fundraiser
$6,000 - Can produce one year of SPRTS, leaving us with a larger budget for artist editions.
$4,000 - For the production of Ashley May's ""A-M"" and ""N-Z"" and materials for general publishing next year.

<h3>Dolls House is comprised of six girls, currently in their second year at Nottingham Trent University studying Fine Art. We came together through similar interests and now want to create an installation based exhibition in Nottingham's city centre from the 18th October 2011. </h3>
<p>  </p>
<p>We have found the perfect location; the basement of a furniture store, which also holds an entrance to Nottingham's system of caves. We are transforming the space which already has some elements of a house into a representation of a doll's house, it'll essentially be a life-sized doll's house and our work will reside within it. We're all really excited about it but to make it a reality we could do with some help, and you guessed it... because we're students we don't qualify for any Arts Council Grants or support!!<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are really hoping to encourage those who don't usually get involved in art to participate in our events, this will be by placing the work in a non-gallery space. We just want to get people involved and enjoying art like we do :)<br/></p>
</div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to secure this great location, we need £500, which is just over $800. Every cent donated will go towards paying the rent for the rooms. We are trying to raise money ourselves through organised events, which we hope will help to finance the private view, as well as any costumes and props needed.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Everyone who donates will receive an art work inspired by the exhibition and a personal invitation to the private view. <br/>
</h3>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Although we will be advertising the exhibition nearer to the opening, we still need you to spread the word about the exhibition and of course come and visit it! We also have a facebook page where you can create your own dolls and join in the fun. </p>

<h2><strong>Fire Art</strong></h2>
<p>Hi, my name is Krueger and I am a fire artist.  In 2010, I created a fire scupture entitled ""Burning Gothic.""  Inspired by artist Grant Wood's ""American Gothic"" painting, I wanted to recreate it with my preferred medium, fire.  It is a flaming pitchfork and photo where people can become part of the fire art painting and get thier pictures taken.</p>
<p>Now, I would like to create my second fire scultpure which I shall call ""Fire Art.""  The sculpture will spell out the title of the piece written in engulfed flames.  There would also be a secondary flame effect known as a poofer attached to this piece for added effect.</p>
<p>The motivation behind ""Fire Art"" is to educate and elighten people.  I would like to use this piece to teach people how to construct a fire sculpture; bringing the world of fire and art together is simple and beautiful way.  I want to illistrate that fire can be fun, safe art.  This project will be NFPA 1160 compliant.</p>
<p><strong>I need money to purchase parts and propane.</strong></p>
<p>Estimated total cost of this project is $800.00.  I have recived a grant from Bold Urban Renanssance Network NFP (<a href=""http://www.boldurban.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.boldurban.org</a>) for $350.00.</p>
<p>I am asking you for your assitance to help me finish funding the remaining parts of my sculpture.  I will need to purchase more complex parts and propane that is the major consumbables required in the creating this sculpture.  No tools or labor costs have been attibuted in the over all budget.  If I don't make my funding goals, I am going to piece meal this sculpture together with what I can, when I can, and finish it at a later time.</p>
</div>
<h2>Contributors </h2>
<p>First and foremost, contributors will recived me eternal gratitadue.  More specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>$25.00: Donors will receive a photograph of the finished fire sculpture at it's first public appearance, Lakes of Fire 2012.</li>
<li>$50.00:  Donors will ""make their mark"" on the sculpture.  Donors at this level will be added to a special donor plaque on the platform of the sculpture. </li>
<li>$100 or more:  Special donors who contribute $100 or more will receive an invitation to an exclusive donor five-course dinner hosted and prepared by mysel for you and a guest.  As an added bonus, you will be able to chose one of the courses!</li>
</ul><p><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>I would like to have this peice completed for Lakes of Fire, an art and fire festival at the end of June.</strong>  This project is going to be a way for me to gift education and art to the community and illistrate what can be done with fire. I hope that it will inspire more people to think outside the proverbial box and create their world.</p>

<h3>Q &amp; A</h3>
<p><strong>Q. How did you come to the price?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. I had to average out demand and estimate numbers but here's the break down.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Printing Fees</strong></p>
<p>500 copies X $5 a copy is about average for that volume.</p>
<p>We are looking anywhere between $5 to $15 depending on the company and services provided. Lulu charges 15$ per copy just to get an idea of how expensive things can get.</p>
<p>So $2500 is a conservative though slightly risky estimate.</p>
<p><strong>Delivery fees</strong></p>
<p>The delivery of the product from the printer to either myself or another company that will ship it will be around $150-$500 depending if it's overseas or not. I'm not 100% sure right now it's point of origin so this number has to be a bit loose.</p>
<p><strong>Shipping &amp; Handling Fees</strong></p>
<p>The worst sin to commit I've seen for any crowdsourced project is to neglect the cost of shipping to supporters. I've settled on $10 as a safe number for both North american and european sales. Though any addtional shipping fees that surpass $10 by any noticeable ammount will be requested from the supporter. This fee covers both shipping and handling, handling represents time spent sorting, packaging, travel and all other time spent shipping the product. The project needs about 100 - 200 supporters to hit the project first milestone so about $1500 for Shipping &amp; Handling.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Final Cost</strong></p>
<p><strong>$2500 + ~$300 +  $1000 = $3800</strong></p>
<p><strong>+$700 Safety net</strong></p>
<p>For Administration, digital assembly, advertising, project coordination, drawing, hiring artists, print proof costs and etc.</p>
<p><strong>Final Total = $4500</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q. Why are you using Indiegogo instead of Kickstarter. <br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>A. Kickstarter is for Americans only</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Q. When will I receive the digital edition<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>A. As soon as the books are printed and start being shipped to supporters the digital edition will be sent</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Q. Will you be selling this calendar outside of this project.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. I don't know but I wouldn't bank on it. If you want a copy this is the best time to get it. Bast december the value of a calendar plummets so it's best to get everyone on board now. </strong></p>

The delivery of the product from the printer to either myself or another company that will ship it will be around $150-$500 depending if it's overseas or not. I'm not 100% sure right now it's point of origin so this number has to be a bit loose.
Shipping & Handling Fees
The worst sin to commit I've seen for any crowdsourced project is to neglect the cost of shipping to supporters. I've settled on $10 as a safe number for both North american and european sales. Though any addtional shipping fees that surpass $10 by any noticeable ammount will be requested from the supporter. This fee covers both shipping and handling, handling represents time spent sorting, packaging, travel and all other time spent shipping the product. The project needs about 100 - 200 supporters to hit the project first milestone so about $1500 for Shipping & Handling.


Final Cost
$2500 + ~$300 +  $1000 = $3800
+$700 Safety net
For Administration, digital assembly, advertising, project coordination, drawing, hiring artists, print proof costs and etc.
Final Total = $4500
 
Q. Why are you using Indiegogo instead of Kickstarter. 
A. Kickstarter is for Americans only
 
Q. When will I receive the digital edition
A. As soon as the books are printed and start being shipped to supporters the digital edition will be sent
 
Q. Will you be selling this calendar outside of this project.
A. I don't know but I wouldn't bank on it. If you want a copy this is the best time to get it. Bast december the value of a calendar plummets so it's best to get everyone on board now.

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Hi Everyone,</span></p></span><p>This is Sherida Holland. I'm a fourth generation Montanan and I recently got back from working on the family cabin in Melrose, Montana. It's hard to believe it has been closed up for 15 years. It was our Grandmother's cabin, a small 133 year old log cabin typical of the early west when mining towns sprung up overnight.(see video).</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/136482/files/20131016105625-cabin2.jpg?1381946185"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Melrose was a tiny stage stop in southwestern Montana along the Big Hole River that served the mining activities in the area. With the advent of the railroad in 1881, isolated mining ventures high up in the Pioneer Mountains west of town soon became one of Montana's most monumental chapters of early mining history. The Hecla Consolidated Mining Corporation, during this period, was the second largest supplier of silver in the nation, consisting of mine sites in Hecla, Lion City and Trapper City. They also had a huge concentrator in Greenwood and a smelter and reduction plant in Glendale. Our Grandmother grew up in Glendale and her Dad hauled ore out of the Pioneer Mountains from Hecla to Glendale down dirt mining roads with a wagon and team of horses.</p>

<p>After retiring in 2010, I moved to East Aurora, New York to live with my son, his wife and their three little girls. Now that I'm retired my dream is to spend more time in Montana. To have the family congregate during the summer at the cabin. To take up my paint brushes and paint the rugged wilderness, vast openness, and breathtaking beauty of Montana. To offer the cabin as a retreat and sanctuary to anyone who has always wanted to visit Montana or longs to return. A wonderful opportunity to enjoy outdoor activities, scenic adventures, history and inspiration. Montana represents the untamed, the wild, the natural.  Quoting John Muir, ""Wilderness takes you beyond your human existence to become one with nature and the universe.""</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Artist's Retreat:</strong> painting, photographing, or capturing as prose and poetry the beauty and majestic wonder of nature and wilderness. </li>
<li>
<strong>Nature Retreat:</strong> fishing the rivers or streams (the Big Hole River is world renown for it's fly fishing), horseback riding, floating or canoeing, hiking the mountains and camping under the stars.</li>
<li>
<strong>Learn and Experience History:</strong> drive up old washed out mountain roads to ghost towns high in the Pioneer Mountains, relive the unspeakable hardships of residing in an isolated mountain wilderness at 10,000 feet with harsh and bitter 8-9 month winters, the daunting and perilous task of early hard rock mining, refining, and hauling. </li>
</ul>

<p> Now the bad news and why we're in desperate need of your help. The cabin was way worse than we thought. Everything we tried to do turned into a major problem. Instead of getting anything done, we left the cabin torn apart, unable to do the work as planned.</p>
<p>Our first goal is to fix the foundation and north wall. The fireplace, cut-in in 1974, was pulling away from the cabin. When we took it out the opening had no structural support or framing. Under the concrete slab, the foundation, partially removed when the fireplace was put in, had eroded further from leaking hoses rigged to the well by a camper using the property for 5 years. This also caused the bottom plate, ends of the floor joists, and the first course of logs to rot.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/155944/files/20131026114015-cabin_group_north_wall_2.jpg?1382812815"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>Even though our first goal is to fix the foundation and north wall, this will not restore the cabin. Several other major problems became evident (see our website <a href=""http://mountaincabinstudio.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://mountaincabinstudio.com</a> ), which will be our second goal. Our third goal is to do an addition of a bedroom, bathroom and wrap-around porch. This will be necessary before we can have guests at the cabin, or offer it as a retreat, since it's a one room cabin with an out-house. We have a lot of room on the north side (5 lots), so we utilized the north wall, or lack of it, to design the addition (see renderings below).<strong> </strong></p>

<p><strong>FOR YOUR CONTRIBUTION:</strong></p>
<p>In exchange for your contribution, we're so excited to offer at this time these beautiful,  fine art prints, on 100% cotton rag paper, signed and numbered, of watercolors painted around Butte and Melrose. They are available framed or unframed <strong>(see Gallery for individual prints and details).</strong></p>
<p><strong>FIRST</strong>: choose a print from a series of Montana wildflowers painted above Melrose.</p>
<p>                <strong>  Blazing Star                      Alpine Bluebell               </strong><strong> Indian Paintbrush</strong></p>

<p><strong>SECOND:</strong> a print from the watercolor titled <strong>""Mountain Cabin,""</strong> painted north of Butte looking towards the Anaconda-Pintlar Mountain Range. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/156068/files/20131026132019-mountain_cabin.jpg?1382818819"" src="""" style=""width: 568px; height: 420px;""/></p>
<p><strong>THIRD:</strong> This painting was also used for the hand-made art book titled,<strong> ""I Love to Wander Down Mountain Roads.""</strong> It is also made of fine art prints on 100% cotton rag mounted on acid-free mat board. You'll also notice on the back cover, you can dedicate the book with your own personal message and your own personal artwork and/or photographs. The book below with audio is from youtube. </p>

<p><strong>FOURTH: STAY AT THE CABIN</strong></p>
<p>We're also thrilled to offer a weeks lodging at the cabin (lodging only), restricted to small groups of 6-8 people depending on the sleeping arrangements. A small camp trailer on the property is also available. You would fly into Butte, MT, 30 miles north of Melrose on Interstate 90 (see video). It will be sometime in the near future, as soon as the work is completed. Although we can't confirm the date at this time, it will hopefully be late summer of 2014 to early spring of 2015. </p>

<p>Please help us save the cabin, promote art and healing, and preserve a piece of Montana history. It is beyond our means and must be addressed  immediately. Without your help, we fear the cabin will fall in and have to be torn down. We want our children and grandchildren to spend time at the cabin, embrace the wilderness and great-outdoors, and come to know and hold dear the legacy of their forefathers. To offer it to those in need of a sanctuary to reconnect with and rekindle their spirit. To experience the wonder and beauty of nature without man's footprint, something so much bigger than we are. To be humbled and empowered at the same time by the grandeur and the grace. To feel peace, fortitude, and a sense of belonging.</p>

Hi Everyone,This is Sherida Holland. I'm a fourth generation Montanan and I recently got back from working on the family cabin in Melrose, Montana. It's hard to believe it has been closed up for 15 years. It was our Grandmother's cabin, a small 133 year old log cabin typical of the early west when mining towns sprung up overnight.(see video).

Melrose was a tiny stage stop in southwestern Montana along the Big Hole River that served the mining activities in the area. With the advent of the railroad in 1881, isolated mining ventures high up in the Pioneer Mountains west of town soon became one of Montana's most monumental chapters of early mining history. The Hecla Consolidated Mining Corporation, during this period, was the second largest supplier of silver in the nation, consisting of mine sites in Hecla, Lion City and Trapper City. They also had a huge concentrator in Greenwood and a smelter and reduction plant in Glendale. Our Grandmother grew up in Glendale and her Dad hauled ore out of the Pioneer Mountains from Hecla to Glendale down dirt mining roads with a wagon and team of horses.





After retiring in 2010, I moved to East Aurora, New York to live with my son, his wife and their three little girls. Now that I'm retired my dream is to spend more time in Montana. To have the family congregate during the summer at the cabin. To take up my paint brushes and paint the rugged wilderness, vast openness, and breathtaking beauty of Montana. To offer the cabin as a retreat and sanctuary to anyone who has always wanted to visit Montana or longs to return. A wonderful opportunity to enjoy outdoor activities, scenic adventures, history and inspiration. Montana represents the untamed, the wild, the natural.  Quoting John Muir, ""Wilderness takes you beyond your human existence to become one with nature and the universe.""


Artist's Retreat: painting, photographing, or capturing as prose and poetry the beauty and majestic wonder of nature and wilderness. 

Nature Retreat: fishing the rivers or streams (the Big Hole River is world renown for it's fly fishing), horseback riding, floating or canoeing, hiking the mountains and camping under the stars.

Learn and Experience History: drive up old washed out mountain roads to ghost towns high in the Pioneer Mountains, relive the unspeakable hardships of residing in an isolated mountain wilderness at 10,000 feet with harsh and bitter 8-9 month winters, the daunting and perilous task of early hard rock mining, refining, and hauling. 


  



 



 

 Now the bad news and why we're in desperate need of your help. The cabin was way worse than we thought. Everything we tried to do turned into a major problem. Instead of getting anything done, we left the cabin torn apart, unable to do the work as planned.
Our first goal is to fix the foundation and north wall. The fireplace, cut-in in 1974, was pulling away from the cabin. When we took it out the opening had no structural support or framing. Under the concrete slab, the foundation, partially removed when the fireplace was put in, had eroded further from leaking hoses rigged to the well by a camper using the property for 5 years. This also caused the bottom plate, ends of the floor joists, and the first course of logs to rot.

 

Even though our first goal is to fix the foundation and north wall, this will not restore the cabin. Several other major problems became evident (see our website http://mountaincabinstudio.com ), which will be our second goal. Our third goal is to do an addition of a bedroom, bathroom and wrap-around porch. This will be necessary before we can have guests at the cabin, or offer it as a retreat, since it's a one room cabin with an out-house. We have a lot of room on the north side (5 lots), so we utilized the north wall, or lack of it, to design the addition (see renderings below). 




 FIRST GOAL: FOUNDATION & NORTH WALL - $9,700 (a stand-alone goal)

 New footings and foundation under the cabin       
 New bottom plate, floor joist ends, and first course of logs on north wall      
 Re-build north wall as specified in detail drawings

SECOND GOAL: COMPLETION OF RESTORATION - $24,900 (a stand-alone goal)

Build a new roof using hand peeled poles per original design, replace sheeting and re-roof
Wash, bleach and oil logs, re-chink logs
Fill, oil and restore wooden windows and doors, replace hardware and glass as needed, trim and paint

THIRD GOAL: ADDITION & MODERNIZATION - $64,700 (a stand-alone goal)

The addition of a bedroom, bathroom and wrap-around porch (400 sq. ft.)
Small kitchen inside cabin
Submersible pump, pressure tank and water line to cabin from well
 Utilities and services to cabin, including sewer, electrical, phone and cable
Propane tank for heating
Backfill, compact and grade the site 

FOR YOUR CONTRIBUTION:
In exchange for your contribution, we're so excited to offer at this time these beautiful,  fine art prints, on 100% cotton rag paper, signed and numbered, of watercolors painted around Butte and Melrose. They are available framed or unframed (see Gallery for individual prints and details).
FIRST: choose a print from a series of Montana wildflowers painted above Melrose.
                  Blazing Star                      Alpine Bluebell                Indian Paintbrush

SECOND: a print from the watercolor titled ""Mountain Cabin,"" painted north of Butte looking towards the Anaconda-Pintlar Mountain Range. 

THIRD: This painting was also used for the hand-made art book titled, ""I Love to Wander Down Mountain Roads."" It is also made of fine art prints on 100% cotton rag mounted on acid-free mat board. You'll also notice on the back cover, you can dedicate the book with your own personal message and your own personal artwork and/or photographs. The book below with audio is from youtube. 

FOURTH: STAY AT THE CABIN
We're also thrilled to offer a weeks lodging at the cabin (lodging only), restricted to small groups of 6-8 people depending on the sleeping arrangements. A small camp trailer on the property is also available. You would fly into Butte, MT, 30 miles north of Melrose on Interstate 90 (see video). It will be sometime in the near future, as soon as the work is completed. Although we can't confirm the date at this time, it will hopefully be late summer of 2014 to early spring of 2015. 
 

AND IN YOUR NAME, A WEEK RETREAT FOR A GROUP OR WORTHY CAUSE:
Because of your help to save the cabin, we want to help others in your name. For every week booked by you we will donate a week retreat at the cabin to an official organization that supports artists and writers, or supports physical, mental, emotional or spiritual healing. Upon request we will include a one or two day art workshop as part of the healing retreat, wanting only to be reimbursed the cost of any art supplies provided. In studies conducted by the National Endowment for the Arts, quality arts experiences improve the quality of lives through creativity and artistic expression. Art's programs ""are flourishing in hospital outpatient programs, hospices, nursing and retirement facilities, as well as other healthcare institutions around the world."" (see website for more information and links)
The Arts Corps spearheaded a similar study, through The Seattle Arts Consortium Project, of art programs in education. The Consortium was made possible by generous grants from The Paul G Allen Family, The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and The Mayor's Office of Arts and Cultural Affairs. It found, ""Research demonstrates time and time again that arts learning is essential to human development - it fosters creativity, engages diverse learners and deepens connections between people and ideas."" (see website for more information and links)

Huh, guess it cuts down on the trampling. Trampling is bad for business. Makes it a real black friday. But we did not get dejected! We went and got breakfast!We checked out other locations, and the only line we found was at a sneaker store;  no standing zone and  a flashing cop cart - but yeah, gotta remember for next year, folks will stand in line for new patterns on their shoes. And then we hit Union Square at normal wake-up hours; there was a legal spot, perfect, with the ass-end of the truck directly facing the park! Yes!AND THEN WE COMMENCED TO SMASHING!YEP, with moms (lots!), kids, first-day-living-in-New-Yorkers, street folk, teenage girls with anger issues and happily bewildered boys smashing sinks, elderly English couples karate chopping styrofoam boards... and the only injury was one blood blister!AND THEN WE COMMENCED TO CLEANING.It was a wreck in there. The aftermath is kind of ridiculous looking, but beautiful. Doll heads, weird shapes and tiny parts of glittering pieces of mysteryschmutz, as well as shards of plastic and the Thing That Should Not Have Survived But Did, like a whole frickin macbook we missed! that company could use a smashing, but someone broke the amazon sledgehammer.A funny irony, though. I realized that despite the b-story ""so what about the stuff"" little poke at society's excessive buying of stuff, a day of shopping for gifts for others is at its heart a nice tradition, which gets people out of the house and mingling. It serves not only the economic purpose of the marketplace, but also the social function. Except for the stampedes.Maybe stores should realize this and put even more effort into the tradition, aside from simply the selling part. Do something nice, something genuine, something creative for the people gathered (which, not incidentally, includes employees), because reasons to gather are slipping away.Which is why we're taking this opportunity to hit you up for ourCYBER MONDAY SALE!WE GOT CRAP AND RESIN, AND THESE SWEET GEM MOLDS!Haahhh, yes, some traditions die hard, huh?Look at the shiny weird detritus to be encased in a polymeric matrix not unlike cubic zirconia (a lie) such that the history and kinetipsychic energy of actual humans' cathartic release is captured for you, encased in a clear gem to hang off your rearview mirror or earlobe or christmas tree, or to weight your most treasured bills down to the desk! It's like having a little piece of their souls!SALE ENDS CYBER MONDAY!!Thanks to those who built, came, supported, and smashed: Jaclyn Atkinson, George F. Ingalls, Alex Augustyniak, Mina Teslaru, Nicolina Tyler, Dan Finton, Ronny Preciado, Joshua Suzanne Ethier, Dirby Luongo, Ariel Derris, Devin Fenimore, Kori Faith Duboff Alicea, Jere Harshman, Kat Millerick, Jonah Levy, Alix Piorin, Max Miller, Josh Hall, all the wonderful donors listed, and of course, Mark Krawczuk, creator of the Lost Horizon Night Market, which started it all. ******* SEE YOU NEXT SMASH FRIDAY! ******The Past:Follow IG  @smash_truck and/or Twitter @recombust for updates!SMASH SEASON IS UPON US Smash Friday is the new Black Friday! 
Stuff takes up room and costs money, and then gets thrown away. Maybe just eliminate the middle part, and smash it now! Also, Black Friday is what you name a day where something serious happened, not a day of buying screens and toasters. Nothing against toast or videos, but oh never mind, JUST SMASH SOMETHING!In the Smash Truck, we've got eye protection, gloves, soundtrack, steel pipes and baseball bats, and stuff to SMASH! We'll hold someone's place in line, gear them up, and cheer them on as they smash the ever-lovin crap out of screens, appliances, and other stuff past its planned obsolescence expiration date.We can even take a youfie (it's a selfie that someone else takes of you, like in the old days - see if you can help get the trend going) with a holiday card cutout so it can be printed from one's own phone - wow!  Mid-tech!Okay, following IG's suggested crowdbegging outline here...WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GETWe need a not big amount of money, but it's truck rental, transpo for collecting smashables (so more of a pain than one'd guess), decor, disposal (yikes, the mafia charges a lot for responsible disposal!), materials for these cast resin gems with smashed detritus in them for rewards, and like, y'know, pizza and beer for crew, and maybe some egg sandwiches day of. It'll still be a break evenish sort of thing. And hey, if we go past the goal, we'll get us some of those Chinatown basement back rubs.BUT WAIT, THERE'S LESS!What you get is one of those funky resin cast gems made with stuff that's been smashed, or an amazing and unique smash rag. Oh! you can also come smash stuff, if you're up that early.Hurry! Campaign ends on CYBER MONDAY!In the campaign guide, it suggests ""The Impact"" as the next subject section. Thought that was funny. ""Risks & Challenges"" is next. Let's say, getting arrested, and trying not to mess up our actual jobs or lose too much money.Oh, and it's hard sometimes to get people to do weird stuff with strangers, but we've had practice.CAN WE SMASH STUFF NOW?",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p><strong><em>The New faces of Tibet</em></strong> is an <strong>artistic</strong>, <strong>literary</strong>, and <strong>humanitarian</strong> Project.</p>
<p>It was initiated in february 2011 when the artista <strong>Andrea López Iglesias</strong> moved to Pema Ts´al Sakya Monastic Institute in Pokhara, Nepal, trying to live with the Buddhist community and the families of the Tibetan Camps, to <strong>learn their stories and spread the word about them afterward.</strong> Andrea´s artistic language has always been painting, especifically children´s portraits.

<p>This series of paintings has successfully been shown in Kathmandu, Nepal, and in Pontevedra, Spain. The artist aims to raise awareness about the social and humanitarian reality of these families and up until now she has been covering the costs herself.</p>
<p>Apart from the series of paintings, <strong>a book will be published</strong> to help the <strong>Snow Lion Foundation</strong> in Nepal, that tries to keep the healthcare and education of Tibetan refugees in good order.</p>
<p><em>The New faces of Tibet</em> shows <strong>the past, the present and the hopes of a better future</strong> for these families. There is no free drama added to the stories but the most accurate transmision of their reality.</p>
<h2><strong>How are we going to use your help?</strong></h2>
<p>Your donations will help to spread the word about the Tibetan situation and to raise money for schools in the Tibetan camps through the Snow Lion Foundation. We will use two means for that:</p>
<p><strong>     1.   The publishing of the book</strong> with the stories of the families in three languages (Tibetan, English and Spanish), the reproduction of the 14 canvases, documentary pictures of the project on the field, and several essays by monks involved personally in the Project like Ven. Khempo Pema Wangdak, Ven. Lama Rinchen Gyaltsen and Lekshey Choedhar.</p>
<p>Thanks to these funds we will be able to print the book and also cover expenses for mailing and indiegogo perks.</p>
<p><strong>Book features</strong>: 220 pages. Square format 22.5cm, 4/4 colors. Double flip cover. FSC paper.</p>
<p><strong>     2.   Your donation will help</strong> with the travelling exhibition to Barcelona, Madrid and London in its first phase. The funds will cover the transportation expenses and the exhibition in museums itself because the artwork is not for sale and must travel to many institutions around the world. The funds will also focus on covering the edition of the communication material for the exhibitions and the management of other exhibitions of the Project in the future, ideally to Europe and the United States.</p>
<p>Working in these two ways, the<strong> exhibitions will put the book in context and spread the word about the reality of the families</strong>. The books, also, will come together with the artwork, giving these children and their families a written voice.</p>
<p>The <strong>book and the paintings will be presented together</strong> to raise awareness about the Tibetan stories and to financially help educate children though their schools.</p>
<p>The donors will be updated about the whole process through the artist´s website and facebook page.</p>
<p>If the funds exceed their objective, the exhibitions will travel to more destinations and the book will reach a major crowd so the humanitarian and economic impact to the families´ way of life will be greater.</p>
<p>Finally, if the budget would allow it, the artist will travel to Nepal one last time to give a copy of the book to each interviewed family and to each school. Thanks to the documentation of the process the donors will be able to see the extent of their collaboration.</p>

<h2><strong>¿Qué es? </strong></h2>
<p><em><strong>""Los nuevos rostros del Tíbet""</strong></em> es un proyecto de <strong>arte</strong>, <strong>literario</strong> y <strong>humanitario</strong>.</p>
<p>Se inició en febrero de 2011 cuando la artista <strong>Andrea López Iglesias</strong> se trasladó al Monasterio de Pema Ts´al Sakya Monastic Institute en Pokhara, Nepal, con la intención de convivir con la comunidad budista y las familias de los asentamientos tibetanos para <strong>conocer sus historias y posteriormente difundirlas.</strong> El lenguaje artístico de Andrea siempre fue la pintura y en especial los retratos infantiles. En esta ocasión, <strong>los niños</strong> de los campos de refugiados también fueron los mejores transmisores de la realidad de sus parientes más ancianos, aquellos que vivieron la huida de Tíbet.Además, se llevó a cabo un trabajo de investigación documental del pasado de las 14 familias de estos niños, que se reúnen en 14 historias rescritas en clave literaria por la escritora <strong>Alba Solà Garcia</strong>. La artista produjo 14 lienzos de gran formato con la narración de su historia familiar escrita en idioma tibetano en el reverso. </p>
<p>Esta serie se ha expuesto con gran éxito en Katmandú, Nepal; y Pontevedra, España. El afán por dar a conocer la realidad social y humana de estas familias, es lo que ha movido a esta artista a autofinanciar hasta ahora su exposición itinerante.</p>
<p>Por otra parte, se llevará a cabo la <strong>publicación de un libro</strong> cuyos beneficios tras la venta irán íntegramente destinados a la <strong>Snow Lion Foundation</strong> en Nepal, que vela por el bienestar de la salud, la educación y social de los refugiados tibetanos en Nepal.</p>
<p><em>Los nuevos rostros del Tíbet</em> muestra <strong>el pasado, el presente, y las esperanzas del un futuro mejor</strong> para estas familias. No se pretende hacer hincapié en el dramatismo de sus historias sino en transmitir de la manera más fidedigna la realidad en su conjunto. </p>
<h2><strong>Cómo se va a utilizar su ayuda</strong></h2>
<p>Se solicita su contribución para poder <strong>difundir la realidad tibetana y recaudar los fondos para los colegios de los campos refugiados</strong> a través de la Snow Lion Foundation. Se seguirán dos vertientes:</p>
<p><strong>     1.   Publicar el libro</strong> con las historias en tres idiomas (tibetano, ingles y español), la reproducción de las 14 obras que ilustran estas historias, fotografia documental del proyecto, y varios ensayos de monjes implicados en el mismo, como Ven. Khempo Pema Wangdak, Ven. Lama Rinchen Gyaltsen y Lekshey Choedhar.</p>
<p>Gracias a los fondos se podrá imprimir el libro y cubrir los gastos de envío y las recompensas de Indiegogo.</p>
<p><strong>Características de la edición:</strong> 220 páginas en formato cuadrado de 22,5 cm, 4/4 colores. Cubierta de solapa doble, estucado mate Intercote G 240 g/m2 y con papel interior estucado mate Creador Silk 150 g/m2. Certificación FSC</p>
<p><strong>     2.   Ayudar a hacer la exposición</strong> itinerante a Barcelona, Madrid y Londres en una primera fase.  Se necesitarían fondos para sufragar los gastos de transporte y estancia de la obra en museos, dado que los lienzos no están a la venta con el objetivo de seguir viajando a más instituciones. Los fondos cubrirían los gastos de preparación y edición del material para la promoción de las exposiciones y la gestión de otras en el futuro, idealmente en Europa, y Estados Unidos.</p>
<p>De esta manera, las exposiciones contribuirán a <strong>complementar el sentido del libro y a difundir su intención</strong> para ayudar a estas familias, y el libro complementará a las pinturas, dando a esos rostros infantiles una voz por escrito, así como a sus familiares.</p>
<p>Tanto <strong>el libro como las pinturas se presentarán en conjunto</strong> y buscarán el objetivo común de dar a conocer la realidad tibetana así como a ayudar económicamente a los colegios de los campamentos de refugiados.</p>
<p>En la página web de la artista y Facebook se mantendrá continuamente informados a los patrocinadores del proceso.</p>
<p>Si la financiación excede el objetivo, las exposiciones llegarán a un mayor número de destinos y por extensión los libros a una mayor cantidad de público y el impacto humanitario y económico en las familias será mayor.</p>
<p>Por último, si los fondos lo permitieran, la artista realizaría un último viaje a Nepal para la entrega de los libros a las escuelas y a las familias. Gracias a la documentación del proceso los donantes podrán ver hasta dónde ha llegado su ayuda. </p>

</p><p><i><b>Mit

<p>
</p><p><b>1.
Das Nomadentum erhalten</b></p>
<p>Die
nomadische Lebensweise ist eine uralte Tradition, die in vielen
Teilen der Erde seit Jahrhunderten gelebt wird. Heutzutage werden die
meisten Nomaden direkt oder indirekt dazu gezwungen, ihre Lebensweise
aufzugeben. Tatsächlich wäre ohne Nomaden der grenzübergreifende
Handel und Kulturausstausch schon seit Jahrhunderten gar nicht in dem
Maße möglich gewesen, wie er stattfand und unsere heutige
Lebensweise geprägt hat. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>2.
Verbindung herstellen</b></p>
<p>Wie
verbunden sind wir in der heutigen Zeit der Digitalisierung wirklich?
Mit uns selbst, mit Anderen, mit unserer Umwelt, mit unserem Besitz
und mit der uns zur Verfügung stehenden Zeit.  Und was entdecken
wir, wenn wir den Status quo drastisch ändern und uns aus unserer
Komfortzone herauswagen? Kreativität, Wertschätzung, Magie,
Spiritualität?</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>3.
Aussteigen ohne auszusteigen?</b></p>
<p>Eine
Frage, die uns beschäftigt. Wenn wir in dieser Gesellschaft zu
Nomaden werden, können wir dann trotzdem noch Teil von ihr bleiben?
Ohne Postadresse, Festnetztelefon und ständigen Internetzugang wird
der Kontakt zu unseren Mitmenschen anders ablaufen als wir und auch
viele andere es gewohnt sind. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>4.
Neugierde</b></p>
<p>Was
ist der Sinn des Lebens? Für uns ganz klar: Es zu leben! Und genau
das möchten wir mit unserem „Horse sense“ dokumentieren. Wir
möchten andere Menschen treffen, die reisend leben, in Jurten,
Bussen oder auf Arten, die wir uns jetzt noch nicht einmal vorstellen
können. Berichten über Verlorenes, das es wert ist bewahrt zu
werden und die Liebe für die vielfältigsten Arten des Seins neu für
uns und andere entdecken.

<p>In
den folgenden Monaten möchten wir die Pferde an uns und an den Wagen
gewöhnen und weiter trainieren. Spätestens im Frühling 2016
möchten wir uns dann auf die Reise begeben und über unsere
Erfahrungen und Eindrücke schreiben, zeichnen und filmen. Außerdem
wird unser Zigeunerwagen ein mobiles Satsang sein, das sich an
verschiedene Orte bewegt um neue spirituelle Erfahrungen mit anderen
zu entdecken.

</p><p>Sollten
wir nicht die komplette Summe zusammen bekommen, werden wir uns mit
dem gespendeten Geld und unseren Ersparnissen ersteinmal ein Pferd

für unsere Berichte nutzen um neue Leser und Sponsoren zu
generieren. Ein Anfang ist also auf jeden Fall jetzt schon gemacht!</p>

meisten Nomaden direkt oder indirekt dazu gezwungen, ihre Lebensweise
aufzugeben. Tatsächlich wäre ohne Nomaden der grenzübergreifende
Handel und Kulturausstausch schon seit Jahrhunderten gar nicht in dem
Maße möglich gewesen, wie er stattfand und unsere heutige
Lebensweise geprägt hat.

Verbindung herstellen
Wie
verbunden sind wir in der heutigen Zeit der Digitalisierung wirklich?
Mit uns selbst, mit Anderen, mit unserer Umwelt, mit unserem Besitz
und mit der uns zur Verfügung stehenden Zeit.  Und was entdecken
wir, wenn wir den Status quo drastisch ändern und uns aus unserer
Komfortzone herauswagen? Kreativität, Wertschätzung, Magie,
Spiritualität?

3.
Aussteigen ohne auszusteigen?
Eine
Frage, die uns beschäftigt. Wenn wir in dieser Gesellschaft zu
Nomaden werden, können wir dann trotzdem noch Teil von ihr bleiben?
Ohne Postadresse, Festnetztelefon und ständigen Internetzugang wird
der Kontakt zu unseren Mitmenschen anders ablaufen als wir und auch
viele andere es gewohnt sind.

Neugierde
Was
ist der Sinn des Lebens? Für uns ganz klar: Es zu leben! Und genau
das möchten wir mit unserem „Horse sense“ dokumentieren. Wir
möchten andere Menschen treffen, die reisend leben, in Jurten,
Bussen oder auf Arten, die wir uns jetzt noch nicht einmal vorstellen
können. Berichten über Verlorenes, das es wert ist bewahrt zu
werden und die Liebe für die vielfältigsten Arten des Seins neu für
uns und andere entdecken. 



















In
unserem Pitchvideo haben wir die Phase des Wagenbaus von Januar bis
November diesen Jahres für euch dokumentiert. Am 31. Oktober war es
dann soweit, endlich haben wir nahe Berlin am Flakensee einen
geeigneten Platz gefunden und unseren Wagen dort aufgestellt! 

In
den folgenden Monaten möchten wir die Pferde an uns und an den Wagen
gewöhnen und weiter trainieren. Spätestens im Frühling 2016
möchten wir uns dann auf die Reise begeben und über unsere
Erfahrungen und Eindrücke schreiben, zeichnen und filmen. Außerdem
wird unser Zigeunerwagen ein mobiles Satsang sein, das sich an
verschiedene Orte bewegt um neue spirituelle Erfahrungen mit anderen
zu entdecken. 

Geplant
ist ein Blog, der unsere Reisen begleiten soll, schon jetzt könnt
ihr auf unserem Facebookblog „Horse-Sense“ den Vorbereitungen
folgen. 


Sollten
wir nicht die komplette Summe zusammen bekommen, werden wir uns mit
dem gespendeten Geld und unseren Ersparnissen ersteinmal ein Pferd
kaufen. So könnten wir das Zusammenspiel mit Pferd und Wagen schon
für unsere Berichte nutzen um neue Leser und Sponsoren zu
generieren. Ein Anfang ist also auf jeden Fall jetzt schon gemacht!

Sollten
wir mehr Geld bekommen als wir erwarten, werden wir auch die Ideen
realisieren können, die bis jetzt nur Träume sind: 


ein
Buch schreiben oder zum Kumbh Mela nach Indien reisen. 


Jetzt
wisst ihr, wobei es bei „Horse sense“ geht und wir sind dankbar
für jeden Euro und jede andere Form der Unterstützung. Ob ihr
unsere Leidenschaft teilt und dabei helft, dass sich diese Kampagne
herumspricht, die Art von Pferden verkauft, nach denen wir suchen
oder uns helfen wollt eine Gemeinschaft für unser Projekt zu
schaffen, schließt euch uns an und habt Spaß!
