<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Our campaign is all about introducing the American people to the most flavor-able Albacore Tuna that can be obtained in the United States, or anywhere else on this planet </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.06em; font-weight: normal;"">except </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.06em; font-weight: normal;"">perhaps, for Japan.</span>
</h3>
<h3 style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">
<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The foregoing opportunity has presented itself only because the Albacore Fishermen of the Oregon Pacific Northwest have recently adopted and are currently processing their Albacore Tuna, utilizing traditional Japanese Sashimi techniques and methodology. The aforementioned is accomplished immediately upon catching each individual fish when bringing it aboard the fishing vessel.</span><br/><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span>
</h3>
<h3 style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">
<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Over the past 20 to 30 years the Oregon Albacore Fishermen have had some severe economic problems ranging from some years of extremely low catch rates, to too much tuna, creating low prices at the canneries; and, of course, always together with the ever increasing vessel and equipment operating costs.  </span><br/>
</h3>
<h3>
<span style=""font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">In order to help alleviate some of these adverse conditions, the State of Oregon relaxed some laws &amp; regulations allowing the fishermen to sell their fish directly from their boats, at the dock, to the public. This allowed them to by-pass the canneries; however, it wasn't enough, so they decided they must also raise the quality of their fish and increase their market share.</span><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> </span>

<p><b style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: large; line-height: 1.45em;""><em>As a certified nutritionist, I know that food directly affects our health – positively or negatively. The fact poor health is now affecting our children, specifically in the form of obesity, is unacceptable. In the U.S., more than 1/3rd of children under the age of 13 are clinically obese. The alarming news is that this problem – epidemic, actually – is getting worse not better. Recently, medical scientists had to add the term “severely obese” to diagnose the ever-growing waistlines of our children, alone. Why is this happening? Aside from social or physiological reasons, it is poor choices in food, and simply not eating “whole food” any longer. We are a nation of processed, packaged food that is void of nutrients and energy for life. We are literally giving our children processed, fast food, as soon as they are weaned. I have clients who tell me their children do not like vegetables and “health foods.” The overwhelming conclusion, I discover, is that parents never gave them any to start with, nor are they eating healthy food themselves. Children copy what they see. Unfortunately, no matter what healthy lifestyle that child may adopt as he or she grows, they will always be fighting the fat cells that they developed prematurely, and most of all, the consequences of limited nutrition as a child. They need healthy food to be given and available to them.</em></b></p>
<p><font color=""#000000"" size=""4""><b><em>The good news is, we have total control over this obesity and poor health epidemic. We can make healthier food choices, no matter what our age. Providing healthy food for our children is paramount, though, so they will continue to make better choices and enjoy good health in their future. We all know that fish is one of those foods that contain nutrients and minerals needed by us all; but maybe some have had poor quality in the past and therefore think all fish tastes the same. Smokey’s Sashimi Grade, Regular or Smoked Albacore Tuna and Salmon have all the health benefits I want for my clients, and with natural smoky flavor that “non-fish eaters,” and even my youngest clients love.</em></b></font></p>
<p><font color=""#000000"" size=""4""><b><em>The difference in Smokey’s fish is the entire process. It is wild caught with a single hook on a troll line (never farm raised), and processed utilizing the strict traditional Japanese sashimi method(s) for optimum freshness and quality. It is then naturally cured and smoked using no nitrates or nitrites. It is processed and canned entirely by hand, in pure spring water or pure coconut water, preserving all of its natural flavor and nutritional value.</em></b></font></p>
<p><font color=""#000000"" size=""4""><b><em>The health benefits of fresh Tuna and Salmon are tremendous. Everyone knows they contain heart healthy Omegas, but most do not know that these Omegas are proving to support brain health and cognitive function, not to mention energy. This is a great snack for our school age children and adults alike. Fresh Tuna and Salmon are also high in selenium, which is not only an antioxidant and immune booster, but also an anti-inflammatory. The standard American diet is highly acidic due to processed and sodas. Acid causes inflammation, which in turn causes a host of maladies such as arthritis, joint, muscle pain, and weight gain to name a few. Tuna and Salmon are also high in B vitamins and calcium, and packed in coconut water; provide electrolytes for energy and loads of additional potassium.</em></b></font></p>
<p><font color=""#000000"" size=""4""><b><em>I recommend Smokey’s Gourmet Smoked Albacore and Salmon to all my nutritional clients and believe they should be available in every healthy vending machine, and store. We need to start making changes in our lives and the lives of our children, even if it is one snack, lunch able, or a single meal at a time.</em><br/></b></font><b style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: large; line-height: 1.45em;""><i>- Cheryl Mothes Proulx; Certified Nutritionist</i></b><font color=""#000000"" size=""4""><b><br/></b></font></p>

<p></p></div>","Sashimi Grade Albacore Tuna That Is Nothing Like You Have Ever Tasted Before     


                                                    


Hello to all our future contributors for our new indiegogo campaign. As you will see very quickly, we are involved in Seafoods, and especially with Albacore Tuna. So, before we get too far into it, we want to assure all of you out there, that we do not utilize any fish specie that is not completely sustainable, and we never use tuna that has been caught with nets; particularly the infamous ""Purse Seine"" Nets that have been in use throughout the world's oceans over the past 60 + years, and continue to decimate our tuna resources mercilessly....  Thank you. I hope you will join our efforts to establish our responsible, sustainable, and renewable New Sashimi Grade Albacore Processing Facility in the Coastal Community of Florence, Oregon on the beautiful  Coast of the Pacific Northwest.
Smokey's Gourmet Seafoods 
                                  

                                        
We are totally ""Dolphin Safe."" All of our fish that we utilize and process are caught individually with hook and line. We use no fish that have been caught with nets of any kind.* The foregoing applies equally as well to all of our endangered Sea Turtle friends, which we never try to catch and eat anyway.

*Note: Tuna Fish caught with nets are unable to be graded     as Sashimi Quality. 
Pacific Northwest Sashimi Grade - Real Hickory Smoked Tuna - In Pure Spring Water - Hand Packed In Our 7oz. Easy Open Can

Our campaign is all about introducing the American people to the most flavor-able Albacore Tuna that can be obtained in the United States, or anywhere else on this planet except perhaps, for Japan.


The foregoing opportunity has presented itself only because the Albacore Fishermen of the Oregon Pacific Northwest have recently adopted and are currently processing their Albacore Tuna, utilizing traditional Japanese Sashimi techniques and methodology. The aforementioned is accomplished immediately upon catching each individual fish when bringing it aboard the fishing vessel.


Over the past 20 to 30 years the Oregon Albacore Fishermen have had some severe economic problems ranging from some years of extremely low catch rates, to too much tuna, creating low prices at the canneries; and, of course, always together with the ever increasing vessel and equipment operating costs.  


In order to help alleviate some of these adverse conditions, the State of Oregon relaxed some laws & regulations allowing the fishermen to sell their fish directly from their boats, at the dock, to the public. This allowed them to by-pass the canneries; however, it wasn't enough, so they decided they must also raise the quality of their fish and increase their market share. 

See The following Oregon State Sea Grant Video:  
 http://s1297.photobucket.com/user/smokeytuna/media/BuyingTuna_zpsbfebf826.mp4.html
 In Short, they elected to embrace some of the traditional methods from the Japanese, whom, up until this point in time, were the only fishermen that had developed and were utilizing freshness and natural flavor retention practices; commonly referred to as ""Sashimi Grading."" The above custom ""bleed-out"" action, when practiced properly, will ensure the inherent high quality traits and attributes of the fish, along with the natural and providential flavors of the fresh Albacore Tuna.
We, in turn, want to help our chosen host community of: Florence, Oregon to establish its respective and unique location on the Oregon Coast as the: 
"" THE NORTHWEST PACIFIC ALBACORE TUNA CAPITAL OF AMERICA; HOME OF THE MOST DELICIOUS ALBACORE TUNA IN THE UNITED STATES.""

HOWEVER, BEFORE WE CAN CHOOSE AND ESTABLISH OUR INITIAL OPERATIONAL LOCATION, WE MUST LAY THE FOUNDATION OF TRUST AND SUPPORT WITHIN THE COMMUNITY THAT MEETS OUR CRITERIA.
Via The Use Of Stretch Goal Funding, This Will Be Our First Tier To Raise Funding - If This First Campaign is Successful - We will Go On To Our Second Tier Funding Campaign 

Our initial funding level is a total of $5,500. This amount will provide us the means to accomplish the following:1. Allow us to travel to the Oregon Coast and visit our four primary locations. (Coastal Communities which we have tentatively determined would meet our basic requirements to set-up our initial processing facility). 


1. I would like to update here that we have currently decided to establish our facility in Florence, Oregon. At this stage it appears that it meets our overall criteria.

2. The funding will also allow us to print-up descriptive material about our plans, and present it to the key community leaders and citizens, in order to gather support and backing for our indiegogo campaign (second funding tier); particularly within those coastal communities that would welcome our future economic contribution to their respective areas. This would also include the local Elks Club, Kiwanis and Rotary Clubs, as well as the local newspapers, Radio Stations, etc. Finally, we would meet personally with key city officials to ascertain their acceptance (welcome levels), and/or any objections they may have to our business intentions.
3.We would lay out the groundwork, within the community of Florence, Oregon for their support and loyalty regarding, not only our serious efforts to make a difference, but to gather an indication about their feelings towards establishing their respective community as:
""THE NORTHWEST PACIFIC ALBACORE TUNA CAPITAL OF AMERICA; HOME OF THE MOST DELICIOUS AND ONLY SASHIMI QUALITY ALBACORE TUNA IN THE UNITED STATES.""

4. In addition, during our visit, we will need to purchase some fresh Albacore Tuna in order to process, smoke & can sufficient prototype samples, of not only our new Solid White Sashimi Grade Albacore Tuna, but also for our new ""Sea Snak Pak,"" which includes a 3oz. can of either Real Hickory Smoked Albacore Tuna, or Real Western Red Alder-wood Smoked Wild Sock Eye or King Salmon.  

5. In total, it is the purpose of this first tier indiegogo funding campaign, to prepare for that acceptance and support of the good citizens of Florence, Oregon; which we have decided will most probably meet all of our requirements towards establishing our proposed sea food processing & packaging facility.
FURTHERMORE, IT WILL BUILD A SOLID NETWORK OF ENTHUSIASTIC SUPPORTERS/CONTRIBUTORS THAT WE WILL NEED FOR THE SECOND TIER OF FUNDING.
The Foregoing Is What We Need - The Following Is What You'll Get ... Exceptional ""Perks"" That Will Be Available For The Contributors Of This Campaign & The Next.  



1. Most of the perks we will be providing our contributors will include several of our products; most notably our new Sashimi Grade Solid White Hand Packed Albacore Tuna in pure spring water, and no adverse additives of any kind. They will also include our new Gourmet Sashimi Quality Albacore Tuna Cured in Pure Oregon Apple Juice, Smoked with Real Hickory Wood, and packed in pure spring water as well. 


In addition, it is very important to us, that our indiegogo.com campaign contributors will be some of the first to experience the extraordinary difference in the taste of our new Sashimi Grade Solid White Albacore Tuna, as opposed to all the previous Albacore Tuna that they have had throughout their lifetime. 2. Some of the Perks will provide other forms of rewards to certain contributors, providing them options that could allow them to participate more directly within the new company; after the first tier of funding has been reached, and continuing as contributors; becoming active equity partners. 3. Other Perks will be based upon reaching a certain threshold, such as: ""Successfully reaching our goal for this first tier of funding."" Original contributors could also receive additional Perks with dramatic increases in value and substance, depending upon the initial funding category chosen by the individual contributor(s). 

4. We urge all of our supporting contributors to choose a category, whether for $5.00 or $500.00. Pick the ""Perk"" that is most applicable to your interests and the extent of desired involvement. However, even if you choose not to participate as an active ""contributor,"" please pass the word around to your friends and others. Remember, even a little involvement can provide exceptional returns; not only on an immediate basis, but into the future as well.
Let's Take A Look At Some Of The Products..                                                                     


Most contributors will receive at least one 7oz. can of real Hickory Smoked Sashimi Grade Albacore Tuna - in pure spring water.                                                                                                                             




Along with Albacore Tuna - Some perks will include one or more 7oz. cans of Custom Hand Packed Alaskan Alderwood Smoked Sock Eye Salmon or a 7oz. can of troll caught Chinook (King) Salmon - Custom Smoked with real Western Red Alderwood.

Each ""SnakPak"" will contain one 3oz. can of either smoked or regular Albacore Tuna, or smoked Sock Eye Salmon. Both loaded with exceptional heart healthy nutrients with no chemical or other adverse additives.

As a certified nutritionist, I know that food directly affects our health – positively or negatively. The fact poor health is now affecting our children, specifically in the form of obesity, is unacceptable. In the U.S., more than 1/3rd of children under the age of 13 are clinically obese. The alarming news is that this problem – epidemic, actually – is getting worse not better. Recently, medical scientists had to add the term “severely obese” to diagnose the ever-growing waistlines of our children, alone. Why is this happening? Aside from social or physiological reasons, it is poor choices in food, and simply not eating “whole food” any longer. We are a nation of processed, packaged food that is void of nutrients and energy for life. We are literally giving our children processed, fast food, as soon as they are weaned. I have clients who tell me their children do not like vegetables and “health foods.” The overwhelming conclusion, I discover, is that parents never gave them any to start with, nor are they eating healthy food themselves. Children copy what they see. Unfortunately, no matter what healthy lifestyle that child may adopt as he or she grows, they will always be fighting the fat cells that they developed prematurely, and most of all, the consequences of limited nutrition as a child. They need healthy food to be given and available to them.
The good news is, we have total control over this obesity and poor health epidemic. We can make healthier food choices, no matter what our age. Providing healthy food for our children is paramount, though, so they will continue to make better choices and enjoy good health in their future. We all know that fish is one of those foods that contain nutrients and minerals needed by us all; but maybe some have had poor quality in the past and therefore think all fish tastes the same. Smokey’s Sashimi Grade, Regular or Smoked Albacore Tuna and Salmon have all the health benefits I want for my clients, and with natural smoky flavor that “non-fish eaters,” and even my youngest clients love.
The difference in Smokey’s fish is the entire process. It is wild caught with a single hook on a troll line (never farm raised), and processed utilizing the strict traditional Japanese sashimi method(s) for optimum freshness and quality. It is then naturally cured and smoked using no nitrates or nitrites. It is processed and canned entirely by hand, in pure spring water or pure coconut water, preserving all of its natural flavor and nutritional value.
The health benefits of fresh Tuna and Salmon are tremendous. Everyone knows they contain heart healthy Omegas, but most do not know that these Omegas are proving to support brain health and cognitive function, not to mention energy. This is a great snack for our school age children and adults alike. Fresh Tuna and Salmon are also high in selenium, which is not only an antioxidant and immune booster, but also an anti-inflammatory. The standard American diet is highly acidic due to processed and sodas. Acid causes inflammation, which in turn causes a host of maladies such as arthritis, joint, muscle pain, and weight gain to name a few. Tuna and Salmon are also high in B vitamins and calcium, and packed in coconut water; provide electrolytes for energy and loads of additional potassium.
I recommend Smokey’s Gourmet Smoked Albacore and Salmon to all my nutritional clients and believe they should be available in every healthy vending machine, and store. We need to start making changes in our lives and the lives of our children, even if it is one snack, lunch able, or a single meal at a time.- Cheryl Mothes Proulx; Certified Nutritionist

And now I want to become a certified instructor so I can help change others' lives. I'm going to go into a lot more detail about all of this below, but right here I'd like to ask for your help: I NEED TO RAISE $7,000, which will go toward CERTIFICATION COSTS (outlined below, including indiegogo's and other 3rd party fees). If you are able to contribute in any way, please select from the THANK YOU PERKS donated by writers, artists, musicians, photographers, editors, and publishers from all over the country. (If you are in a position to contribute and would rather not receive a perk, every $50 or $100 donation will go a very long way toward this campaign.)
How AntiGravity® Fitness Has Changed My Life and How I Know It Can Help Others Like Me
Read about my first real ""breakthrough"" here. Since then, I have stopped going to all but vision therapy (I still check in with my occupational therapist, but only once a month now instead of weekly). AntiGravity® Fitness incorporates physical therapy and ""heavy work,"" proprioceptive and vestibular stimulation and feedback, deep tissue trigger point massage, and, with the help of the hammock's tight, total body ""squeeze"" (which is like wearing a ""hug vest"") my central nervous system is calmed enough that I am better able to self-regulate prior to sensory overload or sensory meltdown caused by overstimulating environments (classrooms, grocery stores, movie theaters, etc.).I spend, on average, 3 hours a day, at least 3-4 days a week, in the AntiGravity® Fitness studio, and this practice has become a fundamental and essential part of my recovery -- allowing me to reclaim my old life as a reader, reviewer, writer, editor, publisher, scholar, and professor.This is my hope for future clientele: that with AntiGravity® Fitness they too will be able to better cope with their individual challenges and learn to manage the lives and futures they desire. As An AntiGravity® Fitness Instructor, I Hope To Serve Individuals Who Also Have Special Needs

After a few months of casual discussion, Darlene Casanova, the owner of my local AntiGravity® Fitness studio, Imagination Place, asked if I wanted to interview for an instructor position. During that interview, she said: ""How do you see yourself fitting in here with what we already do?"" 
I answered: ""Once I'm trained in FUNdamentals, my primary goal is to help people discover just how able their bodies really are. Once I'm trained to teach Aerial and Suspension Fitness, I'd want to continue to help them realize their own strength and power. I'm happy to work with young, able-bodied clients, but I really want to get trained to teach Restorative, so that eventually I can focus on working with the disabled, autistic, sensory challenged, overweight, and recovering-from-surgery and brain trauma demographics.

Where AntiGravity® Fitness Meets Academia
I feel the need to state clearly that I am not giving up on academia. But I also want to say that, to be perfectly honest, being in this PhD program feels like a responsibility, a duty, something I am doing mostly because I owe it to the old me who had a very clear path laid out -- BA, MA, MFA, PhD, tenure-track University job.
There is a part of me (the old me) that still wants that life -- so badly, in fact, that over the past three years whenever I've stumbled off the path I've found some way to clutch and claw my way back (usually with the help of some specialist. To date, I've spent over $12,000 of student loan money on medical bills). But I don't know if the new me -- a calmer, more peaceful, less career-manic, more present me -- wants to suffer intense visual strain (read: eye muscle pain) and the mental and physical fatigue of an academic's constant reading load for the rest of my professional life. 
All I know is that right now I have an opportunity to incorporate a new kind of teaching into my life by becoming an AntiGravity® Fitness instructor. I want to explore this opportunity because it makes me feel better, because it makes me happy, and because maybe the old me owes it to the new me to just see where it takes us. And if it turns out that I can help facilitate a fraction of the relief I've experienced for even just a few clients a day, then not only will I have spent that day helping others while also helping myself but I'll then be able to go home and give more mental and physical energy to my future family.All this said, I believe that there will be a meeting of these two possible paths -- a middle ground that can support each in ways that I have yet to conceive or consider. And I believe, too, that somewhere between the old me and the new me there is a middle me, who will still be able to teach and read and write and edit and publish, and who will also find a way to teach and touch and help a lot of other people heal.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","REMI is your child’s new best friend when it comes to sleep routines. REMI is a smart, customizable sleep companion that goes to sleep with your little one and wakes up with them in the morning, ensuring they stay in bed until it’s time to get up. REMI grows up with your kids and has the ability to learn their sleep routines, becoming more customizable and interactive as time goes on. REMI uses Bluetooth to connect to your tablets and iOS and Android devices using a mobile app that is easy to navigate for both parents and children. Everything you need to track your little one's sleep patterns is all available within REMI's app.  

 

 

Create your baby’s customized bedtime and naptime routine through alerts, lighting, music and more. Use the mobile app to customize REMI’s colors to ones that your baby will recognize and associate with going to sleep and waking up to create the ultimate sleep routine. 
 Customize REMI’s display and even let your child use the app to learn how to manage their bedtime routine. You can choose to display the time, date, facial expressions and lighting preferences that show your little one when it’s ok to get out of bed and when it’s time to sleep.   
Make your baby comfortable at night with the adjustable nightlight, or even play your baby’s favorite lullaby! You can download your child’s favorite music, record your own song or play some of REMI’s sounds to settle them to sleep. 
 


Track the sound of your child’s nights by creating and maintaining a diary with your app to help you identify what conditions are ideal to foster your baby’s sleep routine. Visually see when your baby is sleeping the best and what times they’re waking up. With REMI, you’ll always know why your child is groggy during the day or wired and full of energy! 
 

Use REMI as a baby monitor to listen to your baby or talk to your child and let them know it’s time to turn off the lights or get out of bed in the morning. With the REMI mobile app, you can adjust the sound sensibility to hear more or less, whenever it’s convenient for you. If your baby is ever sick, increase the sensibility to hear them better or turn the sensibility down for nights when you need to sleep more soundly, but still want to be alerted.  Create an account or log in with Facebook to share your most useful tips and strategies for creating healthy bedtime routines for your children with your friends, family and other parents. If your child isn’t sleeping well or doesn’t like taking afternoon naps, see what other parents are doing to get new ideas that might just work for your little one!  
REMI connects to your iOS or Android phone via Bluetooth, so you don’t have to worry about using up your monthly data plan while connecting to the app. Add and remove different REMI’s, and name them for each of your children- that way you can keep track of all of your kids and have different sleep diaries and alerts for each child!

Set up multiple REMI devices within the app for each child
The babyphone lets you hear and talk with your child from your phone
The tracking diary gives you detailed information about your child’s sleep patterns

stocked full (hopefully) with sanitary towels, tampons and underwear. We’re
raising money to buy as much as we can in bulk, to get maximum value from all
donations. Will you chip in?
We’ve established links with an organisation based there – Calais,
Ouverture & Humanité -  and will be covering all transportation costs
ourselves so any donations go directly toward buying menstrual hygiene supplies
and underwear. 
Everyone deserves to feel clean on their period. Everyone deserves to be prepared.
A couple of quid could go a long way to making life that little bit
easier.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Everyone deserves a safe food supply!</p>
<p>But how safe is our food?</p>
<p>Have you ever questioned whether or not that hamburger in your
fridge is safe to feed your family?  </p>
<p>Have you suffered for your bad decision-making?  </p>
<p>Have you tossed out a beefsteak simply because you didn't want
to take a chance?</p>
<p>Safe Food Scientific has developed a product that lets you know
in real time, whether or not the beef in your refrigerator is still fresh enough
to eat. We do it with something called a Bio-Sensor.</p>
<p>A biosensor is a simple little piece of paper that turns color
when your meat is bad. How does it do this? Well, bad beef smells. Our
biosensor turns colors in the presence of bad gas given off by bacteria in beef
when they multiply and their numbers get too high.  It's as simple as
that. </p>
<p>While we are working on lab certifying for pork, poultry, lamb and fish.  We have already engineered one for beef, called it our
Beef-Fresh Check Sensor™, And right now, a national premium grocer has
tested it and they are considering putting it into all of their stores.  A
regional grocer is ready to put this on the shelves in New England “whenever
you are ready.""</p>
<p>Our “Beef-Fresh Check™” sensors provide consumers with
laboratory precision at home in an easy to use tab, “A Lab in a Tab™”! We at
Safe Food Scientific Inc., have been working diligently for years to get our
first consumer product, “Beef-Fresh Check” sensors production-ready. With local
independent labs confirming our accuracy in measuring the amount of bacteria in
beef as it spoils, we are ready to bring this power to where it can have the
biggest impact, right to your kitchen.</p>
<p>Different types of spoilage bacteria present in beef, reproduce
at different rates under proper conditions; access to nutrients, water and the
right temperature. These bacteria can grow exponentially, doubling their
numbers every 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Beyond causing disease (illness), large number of microorganisms
in beef, and their waste products will cause disagreeable changes in its odor,
taste and texture.  As meat spoils, gaseous by-products of bacterial
metabolism accumulate and can be detected by our “Beef-Fresh Check ™” tabs.
Unlike other labels or sensors, our bio-sensor technology reads (interprets),
in real-time, the amount of bacterial contaminants.</p>
<p>This process is in line with the FDA and international standards
that establish that food cannot be sold and should not be eaten, when bacteria
counts reaches a certain level (10M cfu/g).  That is precisely the level
that causes the color change in our “Beef-Fresh Check™” tab.</p>
<p>In addition, Safe Food Scientific, Inc. has been working with a
production partner to validate each step of the production process, and
finally, our “Beef-Fresh Check™” Home Freshness Monitor is now
production-ready.</p>
<p>Our goal is to have these available to US consumers in the
spring of 2014. We are working with premium grocers at the regional and
national levels, and they are awaiting our sensors for pilot testing!</p>
<p>So we come to the Indiegogo community looking for funds to
support our initial production of “Beef-Fresh Check™” tabs!  </p>
<p>We also have strong interest from the international marketplace
(Australia, Africa and Asia). At Safe Food Scientific, we are excited at the
opportunity to give people around the world the power to ensure the meat they
eat is as fresh and safe as possible!</p>
<p>Your support of our Campaign will help give people around the
world the ability to ensure the food they give their loved ones is as fresh as
possible! </p>
<p><b>What We Need!</b></p>

Our needs are simple yet come with a heavy price tag. Our training program would like to purchase equipment to be utilized for outdoors boot camps, one on one training, and physical fitness assessments. 






The needs for the facility itself, include but are not limited to the  purchase of 10 new spins bikes, a possibility of 2 new treadmills and elliptical, 2 squat racks , and other small accessory needs and maintenance. 
Hunger Run
Budgeting for a community event can be difficult and raising awareness has been a challenge. Timing systems, awards, and event shirts all add up fairly quickly. That's why we will be using a percentage of the funds to help fund the 2015 Hunger Run.

<h3>Mein Vorhaben  </h3>
<div>Ich bin Marvin, 28 Jahre alt und absolut sportbegeistert. Seit meiner Kindheit treibe ich Sport und achte extrem auf meine Ernährung, da ich eine Stoffwechselstörung habe. Ich spiele seit 20 Jahren Badminton und gehe regelmäßig ins Fitnessstudio. Das Fitnesstraining brachte mich auch auf meine Geschäftsidee. </div>
<div>Ich habe vor einen Lieferservice für Sportnahrung zu starten. Darunter kannst du dir das Prinzip vom klassischen Pizzataxi vorstellen. Über meine Homepage <a href=""http://www.nutrip.de"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.nutrip.de</a> kann die Ware bestellt und noch am selben Tag geliefert werden.</div>
<div>Die Idee kam mir nach einem Trainingstag. Wenn man regelmäßig trainiert ist die Ernährung und die dazu passende Sportnahrung sehr wichtig und mit unter ausschlaggebend für die eigenen Ziele. Wenn man beispielsweise nach Hause kommt und man hat seinen Proteinshake nicht mehr vorrätig, so kann dies den Erfolg unterbrechen. Bestellt man aber noch am selben Tag sein gewünschtes Produkt bei NUTRIp, so ist eine Lückenlose Versorgung gegeben.  Der Name NUTRIp setzt sich aus Nutrition =Ernährung/ Ernährungsweise, Trip= die Fahrt zusammen. </div>
<div>Da sich die Anzahl der Mitglieder in Fitnessstudios drastisch vermehrt, so sehe ich darin stetig wachsendes Kundenpotenzial. </div>
</div><div>Ich habe mein Startkapital mit 10.000 Euro berechnet. Da es sich um einen Lieferservice handelt, benötige ich einen Lieferwagen. Damit ich und meine Idee ins Gespräch kommt, wird einiges an Werbematerial benötigt. Ich habe vor den Lieferwagen auffällig zu bekleben, in den Lokalen Zeitschriften werden Annoncen geschaltet. Flyer werden ausgelegt, besonders in Geschäften für Sportmode, natürlich in Fitnessstudios. Wurfblätter werden verteilt, explizit in der nähe von Fitnessstudios und anderen Sporteinrichtungen. Eine große Summe wird für die Sportnahrung benötigt. Ich möchte ausschließlich qualitativ hochwertige Produkte beziehen. Des Weiteren  werden T-Shirts und Shaker bedruckt und als Werbegeschenke in den Umlauf gebracht. Die Homepage ist bereits Programmiert und kann jeder Zeit an den Start gehen. Neue Medien wie Instagram und Facebook werde ich natürlich auch nutzen. </div><div> <p>Wenn ich das Funding-Ziel nicht erreichen sollte, müsste ich den ""normalen"" Weg gehen zur Bank beziehungsweise KFW Förderung. An der Umsetzung und an den Erfolg glaube ich und ich werde meine Idee in jedem Fall verwirklichen. </p>
</div><div>
<p>Im laufe der letzten Jahre habe ich beobachtet wie enorm sich das Thema Körper und Ernährung verändert hat. Fitnessstudios Boomen, es gibt immer mehr Veganer,  Bio-Supermärkte gibt es an fast jeder Ecke. Der neuste Trend aus den Staaten sind Detox Saftkuren die zum Kunden nach Hause geliefert werden. Warum dann nicht auch die Sportnahrung? Genau das habe ich zu meiner Idee gemacht. Qualitativ hochwertige Sportnahrung die nach Bestellung sofort wie ein Pizza nach Hause geliefert wird. Ich möchte einen Beitrag zu dem neuen gesunden Körpergefühl beitragen. </p>
</div><div> <p>Ich werde der erste Sportnahrungslieferservice sein, der sofort nach Bestellung noch am selben Tag liefert. Der Bedarf ist mehr als Vorhanden. Alleine im Fitnessstudio, welches ca. 5km von mir entfernt ist, zählt derzeit 7500 Mitglieder. Würde nur jedes 50 Mitglied potenzieller Kunde sein, so wären dies 150 Kunden. Deutschland ist eines der drei Umsatzstärksten Länder Weltweit, in der Fitness/ Sportnahrungsbranche. Im Jahre 2013 lag der Umsatz der Fitnessindustrie alleine in Europa bei 32,02 Mrd US $ (Quelle: Statista.com). Der Umsatz ist Tendenz steigend. All diese Fakten sprechen für sich und lassen mich nicht an meinem Erfolg zweifeln. </p>

<div>I am Marvin, 28 years old and absolutely enthusiastic in sports. Since my childhood I am doing sports and pay a lot of attention to my nutrition because i have a special metabolic disturbance. I play badminton for 20 years and i go to the gym regularly. Through the fitness training i came up with my business idea. I want to start a Nutrition delivery service. So you can imagine this idea as a  simple pizza taxi just for Nutrition. Via my Homepage <a href=""http://www.nutrip.de"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.nutrip.de</a> you can order your Nutrition and you will be delivered on the same day. The idea came to me on a training day. If you train regularly the Nutrition is very important for your success. So if you come home after training and you don't have any protein shake this can interrupt the performance. But if you order on the same day your product on NUTRIp, a complete supply is given. The name NUTRIp is a composite from Nutrition and Trip. The members in gyms is always getting more and more, because of this point i see a constantly growing customer potential. My start-up capital is 10000 Euro / 11223 US$. So it is a delivery service and i need a little van. I need a lot of publicity material. The van gets full of NUTRIp stickers. I do listings in local magazines. We give Flyers to shops for sports fashion an of course to the gyms. Most of the money i need for the quality Nutrition. I only want to order the best brands. Further shaker and Tshirts be printed and will be put in circulation. The homepage is already programmed and can be started. I have a account on instagram: nutrip_lieferservice and i Facebook is coming next. If i don't reach the target i need to go the normal way to the Bank. I believe in my ideas any time and i implement them. </div>
<div>During the last couple of years i have observed how the topic of body and nutrition has changed. Gyms are booming, there are more and more vegetarian, organic supermarkets are on every corner. The latest trend in america are detox cures that are delivered to customers home. Why not the sports nutrition? This is my business! You need a shake in the afternoon after training, and have nothing at home, you order your product on NUTRIp and get it at home like a pizza. I will be the first delivery service which supplies on the same day after request. Potential customers are more than available. Just an example, the gym just next to me has 7500 members, if any 50 member is a potential customer for me this would be 150 customers. Germany is one of the three major revenue countries world-wide, in the fitness/sports nutrition industry. In 2013 the sales of the fitness industry was 32,02 Mrd US$ just in Europe  (Source statista.com).

<div>Everyone who speaks about my idea NUTRIp brings the project a little bit forward. Told your friends about it, get a feedback an told me about it. </div>

</h3> <p>Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder is a severe mood disorder caused by a negative physiological reaction to a woman's own ovulation cycle. While only recently has PMDD been recognized by the American Psychiatric Association as a true disorder, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">it has been disrupting (and even some times taking) lives for generations</span>.</p>
<p>This disorder is often referred to as a severe form of PMS, which is a common collection of symptoms that affect as much as 80% of menstruating women.  <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">PMDD on the other hand affects up to 18% of women of reproductive age</span>. Calling it a severe form of PMS only serves to fuel the stigma that women should be able to self-control their symptoms or at the very least silence them with an over the counter medication.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The truth is PMDD destroys lives</span>. Just ask a women who has it or her partner or parents or friends. Women with PMDD lose the ability to operate in their day to day lives. <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">They suffer emotionally and physically. Relationships are severed. Career goals are diminished. Ability to function is destroyed</span>. Just ask a women with PMDD or her partner or her kids. <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">PMDD is not PMS</span>.</p>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>My Story</h3> <p>I wasn't diagnosed with PMDD until my early 30s. <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">It was the result of a self-diagnosis </span>later verified by my medical team.  After the birth of my first child and upon the return my ovulation cycle,<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> I began experiencing bouts of panic attacks, depression and suicidal thoughts</span>. I thought I was losing my mind. <br/></p>
<p>I had already been treated and cleared of postpartum depression, but my symptoms were worsening and oddly <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">only occurring in the 12-14 days before the onset of my period.</span></p>
<p>I knew I wasn't bipolar. <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">I hoped I wasn't going insane</span>.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">My disorder was destroying my family</span>. Ultimately, I ended up self-committing to a psychiatric hospital after months of reoccurring symptoms. I brought with me one of the very few <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/PMDD-Phenomenon-Diana-Dell-ebook/dp/B00B4QRIH2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1415901286&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=pmdd"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">books written on PMDD</a>, and <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">used my time at the hospital to truly research my disorder</span>. I read my book. I asked for printouts. I talked openly with doctors. <br/></p>
<p>Unfortunately (and not surprisingly) my chart was noted with PMDD, but <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">most of the staff did not know what it was</span>. While there, I was also diagnosed as bipolar and <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">given Lamictal</span>, an anti-seizure medication which is sometimes <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">used to treat bipolar mood disorders and epilepsy. I have neither.</span></p>
<p>I did start feeling better and was cleared to be sent home. <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Less than 24 hours back with my family I began suffering even worse than when I went in</span>. I was convinced I was going to die. That my heart would stop. My anxiety was greater than ever before. <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The doctors refused to listen.</span> Or rather, they listened, but didn't believe. They didn't believe I was giving the medication a chance. They didn't believe ""all I had was a premenstrual disorder"" and not a different, better known disorder.<br/></p>
<p>See the difference is,<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> PMDD is a specific set of symptoms that only occur during the luteal phase (the time between ovulation and menstruation)</span>. Bipolar, even though similarly cyclical, does not occur with such precision. <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">A woman with PMDD and who knows her cycle well, can pinpoint to the day when symptoms will start</span> and often when they will end.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Every woman deserves access to proper medical care and all women deserve access to available information</span> as I did and continue to have. <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">This is why I am so passionate about this cause.</span> As the administrator to several PMDD support groups <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">I see day after day, women joining up not knowing what they have and how to treat it.</span> They are so often given misinformation or improper treatments that ultimately make them worse. <br/></p>
<p>With the information I have sought out, my life and my family are so much better for it. Every woman deserves this.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>I Call Bullsh*t<br/>
</h3>
<p>Us more ""Seasoned PMDD Sisters"", often tell the newer members that ""every case is different and you have to try several treatments to find yours"". I personally feel that is bullshit. <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Why should a woman have to gamble endless amounts of money and time and quality of life just to receive the proper treatment and diagnosis they deserve?</span></p>
<p></p>
<br/>
<p></p>
<h3>Stopping An Extreme Lack of Awareness &amp; Information<br/>

</h3>
Women and doctors need to know the symptoms of PMDD and how to treat it. All too often PMDD is misdiagnosed as bipolar disorder, hormonal disorder, general depression disorder, or worse. These incorrect diagnosis often lead to improper treatments and can have devastating results. <br/><br/>Women who are unaware that they have PMDD can't seek the proper treatment and doctors who cannot identify it risk great harm in their patients. A continuation of absent information can lead to an increase in suicide and broken homes as well as malpractice against doctors who believe they are helping. <br/><br/>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Symptoms of PMDD<br/></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Feelings of sadness or despair, or even thoughts of suicide</li>

<li>Trouble sleeping</li>
<li>Feeling out of control</li>

</li>
</ul>True PMDD occurs only during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, with relief by menstrual day 4 or by the end of menses, and most importantly there is a symptom-free period during the late follicular phase, before ovulation. Therefore, a key to diagnosing PMDD is to determine whether symptoms are consistently occurring during the luteal phase. <br/><br/>There is no blood test for PMDD. While other disorders can exist and exacerbate PMDD; PMDD is not a hormonal disorder nor is it a generalized mental disorder. The only way to diagnose PMDD is to <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/s8zq7prbmyhhjsm/PMDDSymptomTracker.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">track your symptoms</a>.

</li></ul><p></p></div>","What PMDD Is and Isn't
 Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder is a severe mood disorder caused by a negative physiological reaction to a woman's own ovulation cycle. While only recently has PMDD been recognized by the American Psychiatric Association as a true disorder, it has been disrupting (and even some times taking) lives for generations.
This disorder is often referred to as a severe form of PMS, which is a common collection of symptoms that affect as much as 80% of menstruating women.  PMDD on the other hand affects up to 18% of women of reproductive age. Calling it a severe form of PMS only serves to fuel the stigma that women should be able to self-control their symptoms or at the very least silence them with an over the counter medication.
The truth is PMDD destroys lives. Just ask a women who has it or her partner or parents or friends. Women with PMDD lose the ability to operate in their day to day lives. They suffer emotionally and physically. Relationships are severed. Career goals are diminished. Ability to function is destroyed. Just ask a women with PMDD or her partner or her kids. PMDD is not PMS.

 

My Story I wasn't diagnosed with PMDD until my early 30s. It was the result of a self-diagnosis later verified by my medical team.  After the birth of my first child and upon the return my ovulation cycle, I began experiencing bouts of panic attacks, depression and suicidal thoughts. I thought I was losing my mind. 
I had already been treated and cleared of postpartum depression, but my symptoms were worsening and oddly only occurring in the 12-14 days before the onset of my period.
I knew I wasn't bipolar. I hoped I wasn't going insane.
My disorder was destroying my family. Ultimately, I ended up self-committing to a psychiatric hospital after months of reoccurring symptoms. I brought with me one of the very few books written on PMDD, and used my time at the hospital to truly research my disorder. I read my book. I asked for printouts. I talked openly with doctors. 
Unfortunately (and not surprisingly) my chart was noted with PMDD, but most of the staff did not know what it was. While there, I was also diagnosed as bipolar and given Lamictal, an anti-seizure medication which is sometimes used to treat bipolar mood disorders and epilepsy. I have neither.
I did start feeling better and was cleared to be sent home. Less than 24 hours back with my family I began suffering even worse than when I went in. I was convinced I was going to die. That my heart would stop. My anxiety was greater than ever before. The doctors refused to listen. Or rather, they listened, but didn't believe. They didn't believe I was giving the medication a chance. They didn't believe ""all I had was a premenstrual disorder"" and not a different, better known disorder.
See the difference is, PMDD is a specific set of symptoms that only occur during the luteal phase (the time between ovulation and menstruation). Bipolar, even though similarly cyclical, does not occur with such precision. A woman with PMDD and who knows her cycle well, can pinpoint to the day when symptoms will start and often when they will end.
Every woman deserves access to proper medical care and all women deserve access to available information as I did and continue to have. This is why I am so passionate about this cause. As the administrator to several PMDD support groups I see day after day, women joining up not knowing what they have and how to treat it. They are so often given misinformation or improper treatments that ultimately make them worse. 
With the information I have sought out, my life and my family are so much better for it. Every woman deserves this.


I Call Bullsh*t

Us more ""Seasoned PMDD Sisters"", often tell the newer members that ""every case is different and you have to try several treatments to find yours"". I personally feel that is bullshit. Why should a woman have to gamble endless amounts of money and time and quality of life just to receive the proper treatment and diagnosis they deserve?



Stopping An Extreme Lack of Awareness & Information
Of the 500 women surveyed in a 2009 study, 8 out of 10 did not know that severe premenstrual 
problems have been officially classified as PMDD, nor did they know that
 such problems can be diagnosed and treated. Even more disturbing is 
that the one in 4 respondents who described their premenstrual symptoms 
as strong or severe were among those unaware of PMDD.In 2014, with the advancement of the internet (especially Facebook) more and more women are able to connect with other women with PMDD to find support and help in reaching a diagnosis. A major roadblock still exists, however, in the awareness of this disorder as well as a lack of information available. There have been several studies on PMDD, but any effort being put into distributing this information to patients and doctors has been minimal. What we need is a concentrated effort to distribute information to both groups of people, and it needs to be distributed in a way that can be universally understood.Also needed is more funding for research on what causes PMDD and how to treat it. While pharmaceutical companies are quite ready to offer treatments, it is still unknown what actually causes PMDD. How can we be effectively treating a disorder that doesn't have a consensus on what it is? There has been and are ongoing studies on the symptoms and causes of PMDD, but more research is definitely needed.Stopping Incorrect Diagnoses

Women who are unaware that they have PMDD can't seek the proper treatment and doctors who cannot identify it risk great harm in their patients.

Symptoms of PMDD

Lack of interest in daily activities and relationships

<p>Then she got the bad news that her holdings had been squandered by a Wall Street investment bank.  The bankers and and executives responsible got multi-million dollar bonuses, and Beth got left with literally nothing.  Now she's struggling with mystery illnesses that have left her unable to work or even to stand up confidently.  Her marriage has disintegrated into a battlefield, and she can't get out of it because the only access to health care she has is through her husband's insurance.</p>
<p>You need to understand this woman a little to grasp why I've decided to do this fundraiser.  Even in her present condition, her constant concern is for how she can help other people.  She's worried about not being able to participate in Toys for Tots this year, worried about not being able to participate in charity poker runs and other activities, worried about how to help her friends and family in need all the time.  She never, ever, EVER asks for anything for herself.  She's probably going to be angry at me for setting this fundraiser up - she's a proud, southern woman, and that comes with a whole lot of stiff neck and ""No, I'm okay, let's just worry about those people.""</p>
<p>She's a beautiful and wonderful soul, and she needs help whether she's willing to ask for it or not.  So I'm asking for her.</p>
<p>I'm not related to Beth, in fact we've never met.  I'm one of the <i><b>many</b></i> people she helped out a long while ago.  I'm still not on my feet, but I absolutely must try to do something to help this wonderful woman.  She has given selflessly and without any expectation, and now it's time for the generosity to flow back in her direction.  She won't even know I've set this up until contributions start hitting her PayPal account, unless she happens to see it on my Facebook page.  I'll be sending any additional contributions, if any, that end up bundled for a post-campaign payout through traditional banking back to her when they're received.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>At present, Beth's insurance through her husband is about $250 a year.  If he drops her from the insurance, as he regularly threatens to do, that cost jumps to nearly $2400 per year.  This is to say nothing of increased and new costs for transportation, food, housing, etc.  She has developed a series of health problems that her doctors have only been able to guess about over the last couple of years - some say fibromyalgia, some say it's a kind of heart disease, some say it's a recurrence of the cancer she beat a decade or so ago.</p>
<p>Her husband has been profoundly unsupportive, even accusing her of faking her illness for attention.  He's left her increasingly ignored in favor of impressing his friends and socializing, even though she sometimes falls and can't stand up again under her own power.  That situation has deteriorated to the point that she's moved out of the house and into the home of her adult children, but they have little income themselves and are certainly in no position to help with her insurance and medical bills, let alone dedicate the one vehicle they share between the three of them to trucking her back and forth to the doctor eight or ten or fifteen times a month, to the pharmacy, etc.</p>
<p>Basically, my friend is being held hostage in a loveless and at least verbally and psychologically abusive marriage by poverty.  If I personally had the money, I'd happy send it to her, any amount, but I don't.  All I can do is hope this reaches enough people who want to help, and are able to do so. I've set the goal at five thousand dollars, thinking this would be enough to cover her health insurance for the year plus the costs of deductibles, co-pays, and anything else that she might need along the way.  Obviously this won't cover nearly everything she needs, but it'll sure help.</p>
<p>I'm not setting up any kinds of ""perks"" for this fundraiser.  The reward here is doing a good thing for a good person.  No more, and no less.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>The impact is simple:  you can extend and improve the quality of life of a beautiful and kind human being whose life has taken a hard downturn through no fault of her own.  This lady is dying.  I'd rather not see a world without her light in it any sooner than is absolutely necessary.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>There is no ""risk"" here, because nothing is being offered.  This isn't to start a business or fund a charity or patent an invention; it's just to do a good thing for a good person who deserves it.</p>

As per household incomes increase globally, crackpot entrepreneurs will gloroiusly emerge and the crackpot.cube will be their tool.

<h3>     Hi there, my name is Ashley and I'm a 24-year-old who inherited bad dental genetics from her parents. No matter how well I take care of my teeth, they keep getting worse. I brush, floss, and rinse twice a day. I do not drink soda. I simply have a lack of good, tooth-protecting bacteria in my saliva. I had a root canal when I was five and I STILL have my baby canine teeth. </h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>     Last year I had to have two teeth pulled, and this year I need an additional six. This is all on top of having periodontal disease (diagnosed 08/13/13). The treatment for perio cannot begin until the teeth needing extracted are gone. After this, I will be needing dental implants. <br/>
</h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3></h3>
<h3>     I don't show my teeth when I smile, ever. This has been my most 
sensitive subject and the cause of extreme self consciousness and 
anxiety. I've gotten into arguments with people who try to make me smile and tease me for it. I don't want to marry my long-term boyfriend until I can smile in our wedding photos. My promotional modeling career hasn't been affected, but it doesn't exactly bring in the big bucks. My print modeling career has been halted due to the fact that I cannot smile.. attractively.<br/>
</h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>     My job does not offer insurance of ANY kind. Any contribution will be applied directly to my bills. My dentist is in Indianapolis/Southport, Indiana. It costs approximately $280 per tooth extraction. I also need Novocaine/ sedation. I will be needing to take time off of work as well. <br/>
</h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>     A healthy smile is as important on the outside as it is on the inside. Many medical problems can arise due to periodontal disease-- And I imagine it'd be rather difficult to chew with 3 teeth gone on the bottom-right side of my mouth. A healthy smile would.. restore all of the confidence I've lost over the years. These problems are the ONLY thing I see when I look in the mirror.<br/><br/><br/>

<p><strong>My name is Shaka Joseph, I am a self employed Body Therapist / Massage Therapist. </strong>This message is to enlist your contribution to my Knee Replacement fund. <strong><br/></strong></p>
<h3>My story</h3>
<p>This is an individual project, but the cause is worthy of your support, and very important to me and those who depend on me in one way or other.</p>
<p>I am a provider of a wellness service; self employed, hard working, compassionate individual who is trying hard to hold on to this status.</p>
<p>I grew up in an industrious, workaholic environment. There was always work to do be done, before and after school. To catch a break, my siblings, cousins and friends and I used to 'runaway' for a couple hours sometimes to play by the river and in the Cocoa and rubber estates that were in our area. Off course sometimes there were consequences when we return home, especially if Ma or Pa was calling (in my case), but that was a small price to pay for the fun we had. That is how I learnt to swim, doing 'dog paddle' in the river, from one bank to the other.  The dawn to dusk work ethic, with little play time has remained with me to this day. </p>
<p>About 25 years ago in Trinidad and Tobago, I ‘broke’ my left leg in a motorcycle fall. The fracture split the tibia upwards into the knee joint capsule. Several  years ago two different orthopedic specialist recommended a full knee replacement. Those were words I did not want to hear from a doctor, the recommendation was totally unacceptable, however over the last year or so the degeneration of the knee joint started catching up with me, causing increasing pain, irritation and impaired mobility. Most times now I can hardly walk more than two blocks without resting. Unfortunately, the Knee replacement recommendation is now a prescription to be filled.</p>
<p>As a person with a job that requires standing, moving around and maneuvering people,s bodies, I cannot afford to lose the use of my leg anytime soon.  I need to do this operation, so i could continue working, providing service, and supporting myself and those who need my help.</p>
<h3>What I do for a living</h3>
<p>My DBA is 'Holistic Bodycare Hoboken', and I try to always provide results oriented body therapy and massage. Though I am pretty good at what I do, business has been challenging over the last 8 years or so but surviving is something to be very thankful for, and hopefully better days will return for America and me.</p>
<p>As a Body Therapist of almost 20 years I have worked with, and helped thousands of people to get out of pain and other forms of neuromuscular distress, even visitors who do not have my fees are welcomed; over the years my practice have also helped to provide income opportunities for many individuals of all demographics, and some therapists still earn an income working in my treatment studio. All of this is seriously threatened by my medical condition, and I do need the cooperation of others to raise the funds for the ‘repairs’ and the  'parts', it’s called “Complete Knee Replacement Surgery”. Moreover, because of deformities in the joint capsule, the replacement artificial joint has to be customized, that translates into very expensive as well.</p>
<h3>My funding needs, My modest but unique offerings</h3>
<p>The surgery and about 10-12 months of recovery time will cost an estimated $100.000. I have no health insurance. My budget cannot afford it, besides it will be regarded as a ‘pre-existing’ condition. My fundraising goal is to raise $85,000. <strong>and I need all the support possible to reach, if not surpass that goal. </strong></p>
<p>The Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City is the place where I want my surgery done, Their doctors have done more knee replacement than any other hospital in America, and they manufacture the best quality hardware/parts for the replacement.  In this kind of operation one will want to reduce the chances of complications, and repeat operation as much as possible. From that point of view I think the Hospital for Special Surgery is the best choice, besides most other hospitals will charge about the same price.<strong><br/></strong></p>
<h3>There are very important ways in which family, friends acquaintances, and members of the public can support this campaign:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong> Please make a financial contribution to the fund, if you can. What ever you can afford to give counts, and will be very much appreciated.<br/></strong></li>
<li><strong>If you cannot contribute money but will like to help, please do. Encourage people in your circle to contribute and spread the word. Beyond your immediate circle it will be great to tell other individuals, groups and organizations you know, and ask them to support. </strong></li>
<li><strong>Remember you can use Indiegogo Share Tools to tell others about this project and get their support.</strong></li>
<li><strong>If you will like to do some kind of activity to help and need info., please contact us. we will be happy to assist.<br/></strong></li>
</ul><p> All contributors, individuals, corporate and groups will be kept in the loop about the progress of the fundraiser, and will be updated about how the money is used.</p>

My fundraising goal is to raise $85,000. and I need all the support possible to reach, if not surpass that goal. 
The Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City is the place where I want my surgery done, Their doctors have done more knee replacement than any other hospital in America, and they manufacture the best quality hardware/parts for the replacement.  In this kind of operation one will want to reduce the chances of complications, and repeat operation as much as possible. From that point of view I think the Hospital for Special Surgery is the best choice, besides most other hospitals will charge about the same price.
There are very important ways in which family, friends acquaintances, and members of the public can support this campaign:

 Please make a financial contribution to the fund, if you can. What ever you can afford to give counts, and will be very much appreciated.
If you cannot contribute money but will like to help, please do. Encourage people in your circle to contribute and spread the word. Beyond your immediate circle it will be great to tell other individuals, groups and organizations you know, and ask them to support. 
Remember you can use Indiegogo Share Tools to tell others about this project and get their support.
If you will like to do some kind of activity to help and need info., please contact us. we will be happy to assist.
 All contributors, individuals, corporate and groups will be kept in the loop about the progress of the fundraiser, and will be updated about how the money is used.
We are offering some unique and useful 'Perks'. We know that most people give out of their sense of caring and generosity, and we want to show our heartfelt gratitude with the Perks can offer. I also want to thank all the companies and people who have so generously made this great pool of perks possible.

I really hope that this project will realize it's funding goal on this platform. However if I did not raise the full amount, the funds raised here will be secured and I will continue the effort until I can afford to do the operation. Infact, a special restricted account is already opened at TD Bank in the Hoboken NJ branch, where the funds will be lodged until the surgery is done.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am looking for $10,000 in funding to cover the costs of the supplements which have kept me alive to this point as well as equipment necessary for the dietary changes such as a juicer, blender etc. Also, due to the severe backlog of disability cases at the VA, I will be using some of the funding to cover living expenses as I am unable to work at this time. My treatment costs are currently approximately $1,400.00 per month with as much as $100 per month variance. Monthly living expenses are $1000.00 including food and utilities.</p>

<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The regimens I am following are set forth by several renowned Doctors including, but not limited to, Dr. Bob Melamede, Dr. Sircus, Dr. William Courtney, and several others as well as from the research of Mr. Michael West of Glycop co-op. My markers are down greatly and I am feeling healthier in general, but the money is gone and I need your help to continue on to victory over this ""untreatable"" Cancer.

<div>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey Everyone! My name is Jeremy, and my wife Monica and I just received some awesome news.... WE'RE PREGNANT!! Wait, it gets even better. We're pregnant with TWINS! This is HUGE for us. We both had our doubts if we ever would get pregnant, and Monica never thought she would hear those two words ""You're Pregnant."" Let me explain...</p>
<p>First let me tell you a little about us. Monica and I have been married a little over 3 years. Monica truly is my dream girl! I love her more than anything and desire to give her the best life I possibly can. Choosing to marry me was a big decision in Monica's life (and not just because of my personality, lol). I have a terminal, genetic disease called Cystic Fibrosis, or CF for short.</p>
<p>Here's a link to learn more about CF. <a href=""http://www.cff.org/AboutCF/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.cff.org/AboutCF/</a></p>
<p>CF is a genetic disease that causes the mucous in your body to be extra thick and sticky. It primarily affects the lungs and digestive system. The primary complication associated with CF is chronic lung infections. The mucous also causes problems in the reproductive organs. 98% of males with CF lack the ""plumbing"" necessary to get the ""swimmers"" out of their system. Thus the only way to have children of our own is through in vitro fertilization.</p>
<p>Here's a link explaining in vitro in more detail. <a href=""http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007279.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007279.htm</a></p>
<p>As I mentioned, CF is a terminal illness. There are a lot of great medicines and therapies to treat the symptoms but no cure. I usually require a ""tune-up"" every year or so. No, I don't get new spark plugs and fresh oil. A ""tune-up"" is when people with CF spend 2-3 weeks in the hospital, taking antibiotics through an IV. This is why I say it was a big deal for her to marry me. She knew that for the rest of my life I will be battling CF to stay healthy and she could lose me early on in life. That is a lot of baggage. When we got engaged, I told myself ""If she loves you enough to marry you despite your CF, you better be the best husband ever. Spoil her like crazy and give her the best life you can!"" That is my goal. That is why I need your help.</p>
<p>Our IVF process cost a little over $17,000. I have been hospitalized 3 times in the past year and a half and therefore have had to double the amount of treatments and therapy I do, which has doubled the amount of money we spend on meds. We have been doing Dave Ramsey's Total Money Makeover for the past 2 and a half years. We have paid off around $21,000 in debt. Most of that was our 4 school loans, our cars, and less than $1,000 on credit cards. Our combined take home pay is around $50,000 a year. I say all this to let you know that A) we are not wealthy and being greedy, and B) we are very financially responsible. I would want to know how someone was going to use the money I gave them, and whether they are financially responsible before donating. That is why I offer you that information. We currently owe $8,985.24 for our IVF bills.</p>
<p>I want my wife to have as ""normal"" a life as possible despite my CF. It will never be completely normal obviously, but I try. I don't like the financial strain that my CF puts on my family. That's the purpose of this campaign, and that's where you come in!</p>
<p>My goal for this campaign is to pay off our IVF debt before the babies arrive! Nothing more. I'm not looking to make a fortune and live lavishly off whatever we make from this campaign. Having babies produces it's own financial difficulties, but those we will deal with on our own like everyone else in the world.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $8,985.24 to pay off our IVF debt. All the money we have given to us will go towards our IVF debt. Monica has already been putting money aside for years preparing for this by making and selling her custom cakes. Her site is <a href=""http://cakesbymonicap.blogspot.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://cakesbymonicap.blogspot.com</a>. When we say it will ALL go towards IVF, we mean it. Every pennie we have made off of her cakes went into a savings account at a seperate bank for our ""baby fund!""</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By helping us out in any way possible, you are helping me give my wife (and now my twin babies) the best life I can possibly give them. I never ask for help. I'm pretty stubborn and want to be as self-sufficient as possible. It takes a lot for me to ask for someone's help. Even when offered I often turn it away. I used to anyway, when it only affected me. Now I'm responsible for my family, so I guess I have to swallow my pride! :)</p>
<p>I would like to be able to give my kids a good life. I may only live to see 40, or I may live to see 60. The median life expectancy for someone with CF is the early 30's, so I'm doing pretty good right now. My doctors say I should see 50, given no catastrophic events occur with my health. Either way, I want my family to be taken care of financially whenever it is that I go. This campaign, along with Monica and I's hard work, will help me make these things possible.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I realize that the holidays are right around the corner. I don't want this campaign to be the reason anyone has ""less"" of a Christmas or any other holiday. I also realize times have been tough. If you are unable to help support our campaign financially there's still something you can do to help. MAKE SOME NOISE!</p>
<p>Get loud about our campaign with us. Spread the word to your family, friends, co-workers, anyone you can think of! Indigogo has a lot of really cool sharing tools. Any help you can give us will mean the world to me, to Monica, and to our unborn twins!</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Hey Everyone! My name is Jeremy, and my wife Monica and I just received some awesome news.... WE'RE PREGNANT!! Wait, it gets even better. We're pregnant with TWINS! This is HUGE for us. We both had our doubts if we ever would get pregnant, and Monica never thought she would hear those two words ""You're Pregnant."" Let me explain...
First let me tell you a little about us. Monica and I have been married a little over 3 years. Monica truly is my dream girl! I love her more than anything and desire to give her the best life I possibly can. Choosing to marry me was a big decision in Monica's life (and not just because of my personality, lol). I have a terminal, genetic disease called Cystic Fibrosis, or CF for short.
Here's a link to learn more about CF. http://www.cff.org/AboutCF/
CF is a genetic disease that causes the mucous in your body to be extra thick and sticky. It primarily affects the lungs and digestive system. The primary complication associated with CF is chronic lung infections. The mucous also causes problems in the reproductive organs. 98% of males with CF lack the ""plumbing"" necessary to get the ""swimmers"" out of their system. Thus the only way to have children of our own is through in vitro fertilization.
Here's a link explaining in vitro in more detail. http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007279.htm
As I mentioned, CF is a terminal illness. There are a lot of great medicines and therapies to treat the symptoms but no cure. I usually require a ""tune-up"" every year or so. No, I don't get new spark plugs and fresh oil. A ""tune-up"" is when people with CF spend 2-3 weeks in the hospital, taking antibiotics through an IV. This is why I say it was a big deal for her to marry me. She knew that for the rest of my life I will be battling CF to stay healthy and she could lose me early on in life. That is a lot of baggage. When we got engaged, I told myself ""If she loves you enough to marry you despite your CF, you better be the best husband ever. Spoil her like crazy and give her the best life you can!"" That is my goal. That is why I need your help.
Our IVF process cost a little over $17,000. I have been hospitalized 3 times in the past year and a half and therefore have had to double the amount of treatments and therapy I do, which has doubled the amount of money we spend on meds. We have been doing Dave Ramsey's Total Money Makeover for the past 2 and a half years. We have paid off around $21,000 in debt. Most of that was our 4 school loans, our cars, and less than $1,000 on credit cards. Our combined take home pay is around $50,000 a year. I say all this to let you know that A) we are not wealthy and being greedy, and B) we are very financially responsible. I would want to know how someone was going to use the money I gave them, and whether they are financially responsible before donating. That is why I offer you that information. We currently owe $8,985.24 for our IVF bills.
I want my wife to have as ""normal"" a life as possible despite my CF. It will never be completely normal obviously, but I try. I don't like the financial strain that my CF puts on my family. That's the purpose of this campaign, and that's where you come in!
My goal for this campaign is to pay off our IVF debt before the babies arrive! Nothing more. I'm not looking to make a fortune and live lavishly off whatever we make from this campaign. Having babies produces it's own financial difficulties, but those we will deal with on our own like everyone else in the world.


What We Need & What You Get
We need $8,985.24 to pay off our IVF debt. All the money we have given to us will go towards our IVF debt. Monica has already been putting money aside for years preparing for this by making and selling her custom cakes. Her site is http://cakesbymonicap.blogspot.com. When we say it will ALL go towards IVF, we mean it. Every pennie we have made off of her cakes went into a savings account at a seperate bank for our ""baby fund!""
As I mentioned earlier, we are smart with our money. We both drive cars that were made in the year 2000 and are paid off. We live in a 1,000 sq ft home. We don't live beyond our means. We have sacrificed, and done everything we can to pay our debt down before going through IVF. In an ideal world, we would have saved all the money prior to starting IVF. My PFT's (lung function tests) have started to decline at a slightly steeper pace over the last couple years. We decided we should go through the process now, so I will get to spend that much more time with our kids. Living with CF has taught me that time is very precious!

Indiegogo is a “crowdfunding” platform where you support the new products of entrepreneurs by pre-ordering them at a deep discount for later shipment. For all our backers, closer to the ship date, we will send you an email to re-confirm your order details, so you'll be able to modify size and shipping address.Most women have worn bras and tops that are too big, too tight, or provide inadequate support. Repeating daily routines in an ill-fitting bra lead to discomfort, bad posture and anxiety. Committing to a poorly fitted bra each day can lead to back and neck strain, rounded shoulders, tension headaches, poor digestion, and limited range of movement. Women are in need of a solution to look and feel their best in all types of clothing at various occasions. They need supportive intimates that allow them to work, play and lounge around comfortably. Whether it’s a bra, underwear or even a top, women deserve to wear functional, supportive clothes that make her feel feminine, strong and beautiful. Women shouldn't have to sacrifice style for comfort.We’re bringing you a collection of bras and intimates that helps improve alignment by working effortlessly with your body, not with straps, seams or thick materials that tug against it. Women are in need of sensual, posture-supportive essentials that meet the requirements of a beautiful, inspiring, hard working woman’s agenda.

 
The size guides translate for your everyday bra, top, and underwear. Bust sizes for the bra-top (Unity V-Top) are based on the fullest part of your bust. Our technical knits have four-way stretch for better fit and soft comfort. Our apparel stretches with you and retain its shape. As a working mother, I understand the challenge of finding supportive intimates and activewear that allow me to work, play and lounge around comfortably. I wanted to create everyday essentials that would make women feel feminine, strong and beautiful, without sacrificing style for comfort.My understanding of women’s intimate apparel concerns combined with my background in product marketing for award-winning consumer products gave me the confidence and skill set to develop the solution. I sought the help of Diane Lee; former IDEO strategist, Michelle Rose; former senior designer for The North Face, and Elizabeth LeMay; former Nike innovation executive. Together, we researched, designed, developed and extensively tested prototypes to create the perfect collection of posture-supportive essentials. Retro-Future Inspired DesignsInspired by my Korean heritage and love of art deco, Kinflyte has an East-meets-West aesthetic. Design influences included a 1,600-year old Korean hanbok dress and art deco fashion. The retro-future elements are a nod to films like Blade Runner, Fifth Element, and Fritz Lang's Metropolis.Kinflyte is about women who strive every day. We're a kinship of makers, artists, designers, writers, technologists, explorers, and badass mothers.Our MissionKinflyte supports women who strive each day and designs apparel that help every body move better.We have invested in the latest technical fabrics to support our mission, and everything we design is purpose-built.Founder + Co-InventorVivian Lee loves tackling problems and creating solutions in every industry she's been a part of - consumer tech (interactive cameras, Android smartphones), video games (Electronic Arts), and now women's apparel. She was an Innovation Award finalist, recognized by Women in IT Silicon Valley. Viv led the overall concept, development, patent, and design for Kinflyte.The idea for Kinflyte was inspired by her own challenges as a working mom. Raising kids, working in tech, and commuting long hours presented a real problem for her back, neck and shoulders. A year in the making, Vivian has been inspired by all the women she has come across in the development process. She has held multiple fit sessions with women in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago and Portland to iterate and improve the designs. And, she has consulted with women wellness professionals in physical therapy, pilates, yoga, dance, martial arts, and athletic training.",74.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p>One Saturday afternoon, we were in Berkeley and saw a woman and her son selling cupcakes and cookies on the sidewalk. The woman's name was Lavern and she was having a bake sale to raise money for a kidney transplant. Selling cupcakes -- for a kidney transplant! We couldn't believe it. Her medication costs for the first year alone will be $9,000.</p>
<p>Let's help Lavern so she can stop having bake sales and get her life back. </p>
<h3>Lavern's Story</h3>
<p>Lavern has polycystic kidney disease, a hereditary condition that causes numerous cysts to develop in the kidneys. About a year and a half ago, her kidneys failed and she has been on dialysis treatment ever since. She stopped working full-time as a first grade teacher and now spends 2 days a week at a clinic getting dialysis. Her cysts are growing and multiplying, and she needs to get a kidney transplant as soon as possible. The Stanford Hospital has identified a donor for Lavern and is ready to perform her operation.</p>
<p>The problem: Lavern cannot afford it.</p>
<p>She has health insurance through Blue Shield, but her PPO plan only partially covers the procedure and does not cover prescription drugs. The anti-rejection medication she must take after the transplant will cost her $9,000 in the first year. With procedure costs, medication costs, and copays, the hospital told Lavern that all together the transplant will cost her about $21,900 out of pocket.</p>
<h3>The Bake Sale</h3>
<p>Every Saturday and Sunday, as long as it's not raining (and she feels well enough), Lavern drives 80 miles from Stockton to Berkeley to sell cupcakes, cookies, and brownies on the sidewalk to raise money for her transplant. Her 12-year-old son Marquis goes with her. This basically consumes 3 days of her life every week. She spends all of Friday baking, then all of Saturday and Sunday driving and sitting at her bake sale table. She is able to raise $300-600 every weekend this way.</p>
<p>Of course, these 3 days are in addition to the 2 days she already spends getting dialysis each week. This ordeal has pretty much taken over Lavern's life. It leaves her little time to care for her two sons, be with family and friends, and simply enjoy her life.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Help Lavern Get Her Life Back</h3>
<p>This is no way for someone to live. Having to sell cupcakes for a kidney transplant is just not okay. Surely, there must be another way for Lavern to get this operation to save her life. </p>
<p>We want to help Lavern, and we hope you do too. </p>
<p>By raising<strong> $9,000</strong>, we will cover Lavern's medication costs for the first year. Without anti-rejection medication the transplant will fail as her body will not accept the new kidney. For the operation to move forward, it is critical that these costs are covered.</p>
<p>However, we hope we can go even beyond the $9,000 goal. Since the total cost of the transplant will be about <strong>$21,900</strong>, any funds raised above $9,000 will certainly mean a great deal to Lavern.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading about Lavern's story. If we all pitch in together, we can make a difference in her life.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
I speak for Addy, who is my niece.  Addy is disabled, but still the most beautiful 5 year old you will ever meet.  She may never be able to talk or walk, but she will always make you smile.  She has a disease so rare that even after 100's of tests, doctors &amp; medical professionals are unable to determine what is wrong with Addy.  Even with the strength of a family of medical professionals (I am a paramedic, &amp; my wife an emergency room nurse), Addy's condition remains a mystery.  Because of a lack of a diagnosis, Addy is not eligible to receive assistance for a wheelchair lift for the family van so she can get to her medical appointments, as well as to the hospital to continue to allow testing to continue to help find what causes this rare condition so she can continue to help other children down the road.  While the family (my sister-in-law) is very humble, &amp; not asking for assistance, myself and my wife are trying to help, because it is not fair to Addy &amp; her family that they are slipping through the cracks of government. <br/><br/><strong>My only mission is to help Addy get her Wheelchair lift so she can continue to get to the doctors, and make a difference for future children!  Thank you for your support!  Any extra money collected will be passed on to a another needy child, all we are trying to do is collect enough to help our Addy get her wheelchair lift.</strong>

<h3>Family Background</h3>
<p>Marcial and Stephanie Gonzalez have been married for 8 years and have known each other for 12 years.  We are both Youth and Young Adult Leaders in church for many years.  We met in church where we were actively involved.  We have been working with high-risk children since 1999.  We feel a strong calling from the Lord to commit our lives to ministry. </p>
<p>In June 2012, we received a call from Honduras to adopt this child because the mother could not take care of the child.  We had been praying about adopting domestically, but had considered internationally as well.  When we received the call, we knew that we were supposed to adopt little Marshall III. </p>
<p>His mother neglected and abandoned him.  We have been supporting the baby 100% since November 2012.  We got an apartment in Honduras so we can travel back and forth from the United States and Roatan, Honduras to take care of him.  When we are not there, we have a nanny there with him while we go through the adoption process.  Honduras has so many restrictions and hesitations on international adoptions.  We have gone through so much since November 2012.  However, we are prayerful that the Lord will grant us the desires of our hearts and expedite and approve this adoption.</p>
<h3>Costs</h3>
<p>We have started the process by retaining an attorney to have the birth mother sign paperwork, met with the attorney to be deemed Legal Guardians so that we can have rights over the baby.  There are several dates ahead of us to go to the court to seek approval for Foster Parent (2/21/13), Legal Guardian, go to US Embassy to get baby visa and complete adoption process.  The ongoing costs are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>$500 -- mthly apartment rental</li>
<li>$300 -- mthly nanny expense</li>
<li>$900 -- monthly travel</li>
<li>$5000 -- attorney fees</li>
<li>$2000 -- court fees</li>
<li>$2000 -- birth mom fees</li>
<li>$1200 -- Homestudy</li>
<li>$300 -- mthly child care (medical, food, pampers, clothes)</li>
<li>$2500 -- agency fees</li>
</ul>
<p>We would love to raise $15,000 to cover the costs.  However, we want to be realistic with our goal.  So we are asking for $7500.  That amount will be used towards the above-mentioned costs.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>We would be extremely grateful if you joined us in this campaign and donated to it.  We have grown so close to our son, Marshallito and pray to bring him home soon to raise him in a loving, Christian home and to make a wonderful addition to the Gonzalez family.</p>

</h3><p>10, 11, 12 challenge simple really. 10 marathons, 11 charities in 12 months. How do you pick 11 charities you ask? With your help! <br/>
 This challenge could help you, your mum, your dad, your bother, sister,
 grandad, grandma, aunty, uncle, cousin, in fact it could help anyone 
you know.<br/><br/> In partnership with The Costa Foundation, I want all 
of us to select 10 more charities for myself to run 10 marathons for, all over the country in 
12 months.<br/></p><p>How will we choose these worthy causes?<br/><br/> This is 
where I REALLY need your help. The poll I have posted on my linked facebook group (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/101112marathon.challenge/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/groups/101112marathon....</a>) gives
 you the option to add a charity close to your heart. The top ten worthy
 causes in the poll will have an individual marathon dedicated to them. 
This is not  competition, just a way of choosing a few good causes to 
support, amongst the thousands of wonderful charities there are.<br/><br/><b> THE TARGET</b><br/>
 Together I know we can raise a substantial amount of money for all

10, 11, 12 challenge simple really. 10 marathons, 11 charities in 12 months. How do you pick 11 charities you ask? With your help! 
 This challenge could help you, your mum, your dad, your bother, sister,
 grandad, grandma, aunty, uncle, cousin, in fact it could help anyone 
you know. In partnership with The Costa Foundation, I want all 
of us to select 10 more charities for myself to run 10 marathons for, all over the country in 
12 months.How will we choose these worthy causes? This is 
where I REALLY need your help. The poll I have posted on my linked facebook group (https://www.facebook.com/groups/101112marathon....) gives
 you the option to add a charity close to your heart. The top ten worthy
 causes in the poll will have an individual marathon dedicated to them. 
This is not  competition, just a way of choosing a few good causes to 
support, amongst the thousands of wonderful charities there are. THE TARGET
 Together I know we can raise a substantial amount of money for all 
these great causes. The fundraising will be split into 60 day periods over the 12 months to focus on fundraising for which ever charity has been associated with the marathon at that time. At the end of the challenge the money raised will be divided equally between all 11 causes.On a personal level I would love to raise £5000, 
£500 a marathon for this challenge, but I can’t do it alone. Other Ways You Can HelpWhether or not you can donate to this fundraising challenge, you can still help. Please share this indiegogo site and the facebook group with your friends and family.Of course you could also run with me!

<p><b>What is
GUARDRIDE?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<div>
<p>Early one morning in 2013, I was driving to a funeral and started thinking about how fragile life was and how my worst fear was having my teenage daughter or son drive drunk and take their life, a friends or another persons.</p>
<p>Although I trust my kid’s judgment, I know that even a good kid can make a bad decision, and I can’t be there with them at a high school party or while they are away at college to make sure they make the right choices.</p>
<p>Since I didn’t want to be worrying every time my kids went out, I looked for a solution that could help…there was none.</p>
<p>So I created GUARDRIDE to give me and other parents a tool to help keep our kids safe from drinking and driving.</p>

<p>If they fail their breathalyzer test or start driving without taking one you will be notified on your phone and be shown their location on GPS so you can take action. It takes less than 30 seconds for your kid to take the test, and give you peace of mind.</p>

<h3>The GUARDRIDE Philosophy</h3>
<p>GUARDRIDE believes the best way to reduce drunk driving among young drivers is to create a way for parents to constructively engage with their kids and form a partnership based on the principle of “trust but verify”. Because even a good kid can make a bad decision. GUARDRIDE is designed to help prevent that bad decision by having them agree to use the system every time they get behind the wheel during a session. Since the kids are aware their parents will know if they drink and drive...most won't. </p>
<p><b><u>UNDERAGE
DRINKING AND DUI STATISTICS</u></b></p>
<p>·<span>  Underage kids</span> drink and drive 2.4 million times a month</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>22 % of teens say they have recently
ridden with <span>driver who’d been drinking</span></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>25 % of teen car crash fatalities

<p>·<span> 
</span>Nearly

alcohol in the past 30 days</p>
<p>·<span>

<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p>We have been working for more than 2 1/2 years planning and developing GUARDRIDE and getting it ready for launch.  Unlike most Indiegogo campaigns we are finished with the GUARDRIDE system so we don't have any risk in delivering this system in August at the end of the campaign.</p>
<p>We know what the next steps are for developing the future driving safety features for the system and the key guard prototype.  Our team is qualified and has the experience to complete these next steps, but we may encounter some difficulties along the way. We have plans to mitigate all the risks and have enlisted great advisors that will also help.</p>
<p><b>Software:</b></p>
<p>The GUARDRIDE system apps are fully functional, but we still have a little work to do building all the features that we want to eventually include in the GUARDRIDE app. Version 2 with some of the driver safety features is planned for release within 3-4 months after the Indiegogo campaign is completed. Software development sometimes gets tricky and takes longer than expected, but we have a lot of experience in this area and if necessary will look for additional help to solve any problems that could emerge. </p>
<p><b>Manufacturing: </b></p>
<p>We do not manufacture the BACtrack® Mobile breathalyzer, that is manufactured by BACtrack® and is fully available now at <a href=""http://www.bactrack.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.bactrack.com</a></p>
<p>The Key Guard is the only component of the GUARDRIDE system that we need to manufacture. We have a non-working Key Guard prototype and have all the specifications of the components and sizing worked out in CAD. We now need to create the functional Key Guard manufacture ready prototype, which will cost an estimated $20,000-$25,000 to complete.  We will start the development of the Key Guard with the monies that are donated toward that tier and from some of the contributions we receive during the campaign and beyond. Once funded it will take 2-3 months to develop the Key Guard prototype.  After that it will be 4-6 months until first estimated delivery of the Key Guards. We will undoubtedly have surprises on our journey, but we trust that we have the team to overcome all challenges, as we’ve done so far. Our goal is to make the best possible product for you.</p>

</div></div>","What is
GUARDRIDE?



Early one morning in 2013, I was driving to a funeral and started thinking about how fragile life was and how my worst fear was having my teenage daughter or son drive drunk and take their life, a friends or another persons.
Although I trust my kid’s judgment, I know that even a good kid can make a bad decision, and I can’t be there with them at a high school party or while they are away at college to make sure they make the right choices.
Since I didn’t want to be worrying every time my kids went out, I looked for a solution that could help…there was none.
So I created GUARDRIDE to give me and other parents a tool to help keep our kids safe from drinking and driving.



   Brian Griffin – Founder of GUARDRIDE


_______________________________________________
GUARDRIDE is the world's first smartphone based DUI monitoring system that allows parents to partner with their high school or college age drivers to help prevent them from drinking and driving.


The patent pending GUARDRIDE™ IPHONE BASED SYSTEM IS FULLY COMPLETED AND READY FOR DELIVERY immediately at the end of our campaign. Since GUARDRIDE always wants to give back to the community, we thought it fitting to launch the
system with a charitable crowdfunding campaign to help donate systems to High
Schools in need around the country where DUI tragedy has struck.
We have limited quantity reward
tiers for discounted annual GUARDRIDE
subscriptions.  For every 10 families that join GUARDRIDE, BACtrack® and GUARDRIDE will
donate 1 system to the targeted High Schools. People will also have the ability to personally donate a GUARDRIDE system to the High School donation program.

GUARDRIDE Helps Keep Your Kids Safe With 3 Simple Steps

 
                                                         


        


1. When your kid goes out for the night with their friends you       simply start their GUARDRIDE session to help prevent them from drinking and driving.




                                                 


                                                            
2. Each time your kid gets behind the wheel during their GUARDRIDE session they must verify their sobriety & identity by taking a breathalyzer test with facial recognition.




                                                            
                                                           
3. You will be alerted if your kid fails the breathalyzer and facial recognition tests or starts to drive without taking the tests.



Using GUARDRIDE is as simple as downloading the Guardian APP on your phone, the Driver APP on your kid’s phone and giving them the systems BACtrack® Mobile breathalyzer. Nothing has to be installed on the vehicle. During a GUARDRIDE session, they must pass a breathalyzer test before they drive while identifying themselves using facial recognition software. The default BAC (Blood Alcohol Content) setting is a zero tolerance 0.00% BAC.
If they fail their breathalyzer test or start driving without taking one you will be notified on your phone and be shown their location on GPS so you can take action. It takes less than 30 seconds for your kid to take the test, and give you peace of mind.
_____________________________________________________________

    THE GUARDRIDE SYSTEM


                                        


This IPhone based solution is comprised of two mobile APPs and a BACtrack® Mobile breathalyzer. Nothing has to be installed on the vehicle.

Before a young driver goes out for the night with friends, their parents start their GUARDRIDE session.  



                                               








The parent also has the ability to schedule one-time or recurring sessions. 



                                               



Once the GUARDRIDE session has started, the parental Guardian APP then starts to monitor the kids Driver APP to make sure they take a breathalyzer test with facial recognition selfie before they drive during their session. 







The young driver only has to take their tests when they are in a GUARDRIDE session, not any other times they are driving a vehicle.

If the young driver fails their breathalyzer test, facial recognition test or starts to drive without taking the tests, the Driver APP will alert the parents Guardian APP. 

                                             

GUARDRIDE will also show the parents their kids GPS map location so they can get them home safely.


                                            

The Guardian APP’s interface is intuitive and simple to use, allowing parents to easily set-up their kids on the system, schedule sessions and be alerted of any driver test failures.  

                                          

The Driver APP is also easy to use, making it simple for young drivers to set up their facial recognition enrollment.

                                         

It takes less than 30 seconds for the young driver to take their breathalyzer test with facial recognition.  The GUARDRIDE system has the same leading edge facial recognition technology software that is used by many of the top fortune 100 companies.


                                         

GUARDRIDE has partnered with BACtrack®, the leader in breathalyzers, and rated the most accurate consumer breathalyzer brand on the market.

                                        

The award-winning BACtrack® Mobile offers police-grade Xtend® Fuel Cell Sensor Technology, the same advanced technology trusted by hospitals, clinics and law enforcement. BACtrack® Mobile is easy to use; a user simply blows into the breathalyzer, and their BAC results are transmitted wirelessly via Bluetooth® to the GUARDRIDE app on their smartphone.  Since all police-grade fuel cell breathalyzers have to be re-calibrated to maintain accuracy, the BACtrack® Mobile breathalyzer needs to be sent in to BACtrack® once per year.



Silence is Golden
On a normal night parents won’t receive any failure alerts

But they can always check their session events screen to see how the night is going.

   
                                              


And they can always watch and listen to the sessions breathalyzer test videos that are taken during each test to make sure no one is trying to trick the system.

                                               


In
order to give parents an extra layer of safety, we will soon be launching a patent pending steel Key Guard that will prevent kids from putting their key into the ignition until they pass their Breathalyzer test with facial recognition. We also will be creating a keyless entry Key Guard.


We
will also be adding many other driving safety features to the system in the
near future, which we are secretive about for now ,but rest assured they will hit at the heart of young driver operating safety needs.

GUARDRIDE believes the best way to reduce drunk driving among young drivers is to create a way for parents to constructively engage with their kids and form a partnership based on the principle of “trust but verify”. Because even a good kid can make a bad decision. GUARDRIDE is designed to help prevent that bad decision by having them agree to use the system every time they get behind the wheel during a session. Since the kids are aware their parents will know if they drink and drive...most won't. 
UNDERAGE
DRINKING AND DUI STATISTICS
·  Underage kids drink and drive 2.4 million times a month
· 
22 % of teens say they have recently
ridden with driver who’d been drinking
· 
25 % of teen car crash fatalities
involved alcohol.
· 
Nearly
10 million young people, ages 12 to 20 (24%), reported that they've consumed
alcohol in the past 30 days
· 
Every 2 hours a young person dies from underage drinking

Where We Are And Why We Need You

After more than 2 1/2 years of planning and development, we now have a fully functional GUARDRIDE system on the Apple IOS platform, with Android in the plans for the future. We’ve harnessed the best of technology and system design to provide amazing features to help give parents a tool to help prevent their kids from drinking and driving.
                                                  
_____________________________________________________
Where We Are 
The GUARDRIDE IPhone based system is already fully completed and ready for delivery immediately at the end of our campaign. We are launching the system with a charitable crowdfunding campaign to help donate systems to DUI affected High Schools around the country.

Why We Need You


We’ve turned to Indiegogo to open our idea to you and the awesome community of parents and concerned people around the world that want to help eradicate young drivers from DUI. We want to learn from you, and with your support, we will continue to improve on our system and offer more driving safety features to help keep kids safe. 

HOW YOU CAN HELP
Since GUARDRIDE always wants to give back to the community, we thought it fitting to launch the system with a charitable crowdfunding campaign to help donate systems to DUI affected High Schools around the country. For every 10 families that join GUARDRIDE, BACtrack® and GUARDRIDE will donate 1 system with a BACtrack® Mobile breathalyzer to the targeted High Schools. 
There are various main tiers for people to participate along with other smaller tiers:
Tier
1 – Parents can help by contributing to the discounted GUARDRIDE subscription levels for
their young drivers. These contributions help toward the system donations to the selected high schools.
Tier
2 – You can help by contributing to a discounted full GUARDRIDE system to donate to
a DUI affected high school.  We will donate in your name or anonymously and your name will go onto our top tier section on our website donors page.
Tier
3 – You can help by donating various tiered dollar amounts to help purchase a
full GUARDRIDE system for a DUI affected high school.  Your name will go onto our donors page on our website.
Tier 4 - You can help by donating in your name or anonymously to your own high school if you donate a minimum of 10 systems. Your name will go onto our Platinum section on our website donors page.
Tier 5 - Donate towards the key guard working prototype and get full credit towards the estimated purchase price ($125) and also be in first group to receive key guard. 
Smaller Tiers - Help donate toward the development of version 2 of the system which will add driving safety features to help keep kids safer on the road.


The BACtrack® Mobile breathalyzer can be purchased separately for $99 with free shipping for GUARDRIDE customers through this link to the BACtrack®  website: http://bit.ly/28JUABZ
Please use the coupon code: GUARDRIDE, so it counts towards the DUI affected high school donations.



Also, please share via the social media icons at the top of the page, it really helps when you spread the word to other caring parents.

custom software development.  This has helped him amass a large variety of
technical knowledge and skills over the past 15 years.   Ransom’s Bachelors
of Science degree in Information Systems and Associate’s degree in Applied
Science also give him an extremely strong technical background.  Ransoms strong technical background coupled
with his extensive experience in troubleshooting and finding simple solutions
to complex issues has helped tremendously in developing the GUARDRIDE system.

Risks and Challenges
We have been working for more than 2 1/2 years planning and developing GUARDRIDE and getting it ready for launch.  Unlike most Indiegogo campaigns we are finished with the GUARDRIDE system so we don't have any risk in delivering this system in August at the end of the campaign.
We know what the next steps are for developing the future driving safety features for the system and the key guard prototype.  Our team is qualified and has the experience to complete these next steps, but we may encounter some difficulties along the way. We have plans to mitigate all the risks and have enlisted great advisors that will also help.
Software:
The GUARDRIDE system apps are fully functional, but we still have a little work to do building all the features that we want to eventually include in the GUARDRIDE app. Version 2 with some of the driver safety features is planned for release within 3-4 months after the Indiegogo campaign is completed. Software development sometimes gets tricky and takes longer than expected, but we have a lot of experience in this area and if necessary will look for additional help to solve any problems that could emerge. 
Manufacturing: 
We do not manufacture the BACtrack® Mobile breathalyzer, that is manufactured by BACtrack® and is fully available now at www.bactrack.com
The Key Guard is the only component of the GUARDRIDE system that we need to manufacture. We have a non-working Key Guard prototype and have all the specifications of the components and sizing worked out in CAD. We now need to create the functional Key Guard manufacture ready prototype, which will cost an estimated $20,000-$25,000 to complete.  We will start the development of the Key Guard with the monies that are donated toward that tier and from some of the contributions we receive during the campaign and beyond. Once funded it will take 2-3 months to develop the Key Guard prototype.  After that it will be 4-6 months until first estimated delivery of the Key Guards. We will undoubtedly have surprises on our journey, but we trust that we have the team to overcome all challenges, as we’ve done so far. Our goal is to make the best possible product for you.

She was 30 years old at the time and working with me at West Corporation. During that time, LeeSha was my mentor at work, teaching me by example how to be a great leader. 

LeeSha had no choice but to face chemo at that time, which was a terrifying thought for her and her family. The doctors  needed her to go through chemo before they could operate due to the size of her lump. LeeSha handled it like a champ. </span></p><p><span>For the first part of her chemo she continued working regularly and handling her symptoms with little to no complaints. When she began her second round of what she refered to as ""hard chemo"" she continued to  work part time to try and make ends meet, although this was truly difficult. 

LeeSha went on to undergo surgery and have her lump removed. She had a second surgery to insert a port which made life 1000 times better because she could avoid a lot of needles. She had a third surgery: a radical mastectomy, removing both breasts and all lymph nodes under one arm in order prevent future occurrences. This process ended up being one of the most painful experiences. </span></p><p><span>She went through this process of expanders that involved her going into the doctors office every few weeks and having her skin stretched to be able to insert new breasts eventually. 

At this point now, LeeSha had taken on the role of assuring everyone that everything was fine. She had a son, 5 at the time, a family, a girlfriend  and too many friends to count that were all extremely worried. She didn't like people to feel this way, so she took it upon herself to reassure everyone that everything was fine. But everything was far from fine. </span></p><p><span>Cancer is never easy. 

Life became very difficult for LeeSha around this time. She wasn't able to work as many hours, as she was in recovery and very susceptible to illness, which is everywhere in a call center. Paying for prescriptions became so impossible that she had to begin picking and choosing which medications were most important. She had to try to balance work with healing and spending time with her family. She began experiencing PTSD.  

In true LeeSha fashion, she pushed through it. She reached out and got help for what she was experiencing. Family and friends stepped up, and she got through to the other side. 

Then the day finally arrived. On July 31, 2012 LeeSha woke up to what she's called ""the best birthday gift ever!"": awesome new boobs that weren't trying to kill her. Her reconstructive process was finally over and she had some wonderful D cups that she loves.
</span></p><p><span>
LeeSha returned to work and tried to get back to her normal routines. She was a superhero at work, instantly inspiring anyone she interacted with. She showed a lot of people what it means to persevere and handle pain with grace. While working, she fought early menopause that began due to her treatments. She had to continue to take a chemo pill that created fatigue, nausea and headaches, amongst other symptoms. She was prescribed many different medicines, each one to handle the side effects of the one before.

It finally all became too much. In February 2013 LeeSha did have to quit her job. It was a necessary decision, but obviously created further financial strain.
</span></p><p><span>
In March of 2013, Leesha's biggest fear became a reality. A lump that she'd found was diagnosed as another cancer. And so the process began again. This time it was surgery, then chemo and then radiation. This time it took the doctor two surgeries to remove the lump.  

LeeSha went through a harder version of chemo therapy, which was extremely painful, and then experienced radiation for the first time, which terrified her. During this time she was constantly fighting with insurance companies. They were claiming she couldn't be covered for a number of reasons ranging from: pre existing conditions, all the way to- ""You're too young to have cancer."" (I know, it's crazy.)

Her doctors wanted her to have a full hysterectomy to prevent future occurrences, but due to the ridiculous amount of red tape, this surgery was put off for months and months. </span></p><p><span>In February 2014 LeeSha found a lump in her neck. The thought of this being cancer was truly terrifying. The doctor had previously mentioned that if the cancer had spread to her neck, they would be able to do little more than make her comfortable.

This was the first time LeeSha and I could bust out the wine bottle to celebrate, and not for consolation. </span></p><p><span>

Finally, last week on June 10, 2014 LeeSha underwent two surgeries, one to remove a new lump they'd found and her hysterectomy. We found out a couple days later that the lump was not cancer, thank goodness. 

Throughout the last 3+ years LeeSha has taught me what it means to be a good person. She's shown me to be kind to people that aren't necessarily kind to you. To stay focused on solutions instead of problems. To see the brighter side when things are awful. To be strong for the people you care about.  To truly see the beauty in each other's differences.

Well, it's a no-brainer who I would choose.</span></p><p>________________________________________________________________________</p> <p>My name is Ali.

<p><br/></p><p></p></div>","LeeSha needs a vacation!Kelly Gilliland tells her story: LeeSha was first diagnosed with breast cancer on May 19, 2011. She was 30 years old at the time and working with me at West Corporation. During that time, LeeSha was my mentor at work, teaching me by example how to be a great leader. 

LeeSha had no choice but to face chemo at that time, which was a terrifying thought for her and her family. The doctors  needed her to go through chemo before they could operate due to the size of her lump. LeeSha handled it like a champ. For the first part of her chemo she continued working regularly and handling her symptoms with little to no complaints. When she began her second round of what she refered to as ""hard chemo"" she continued to  work part time to try and make ends meet, although this was truly difficult. 

LeeSha went on to undergo surgery and have her lump removed. She had a second surgery to insert a port which made life 1000 times better because she could avoid a lot of needles. She had a third surgery: a radical mastectomy, removing both breasts and all lymph nodes under one arm in order prevent future occurrences. This process ended up being one of the most painful experiences. She went through this process of expanders that involved her going into the doctors office every few weeks and having her skin stretched to be able to insert new breasts eventually. 

At this point now, LeeSha had taken on the role of assuring everyone that everything was fine. She had a son, 5 at the time, a family, a girlfriend  and too many friends to count that were all extremely worried. She didn't like people to feel this way, so she took it upon herself to reassure everyone that everything was fine. But everything was far from fine. Cancer is never easy.

<p><strong>My name is Darin and I am the President of Team Performance Products. Designing and producing a prototype of these golf clubs was a lifelong dream of mine. With your help we can bring it to market. The designs are complete and the manufacturers are ready to go, so we need to raise a minimum of $50,000 to market the clubs through a national media buy. So, we need you to help our dream become a reality!  As you saw from our video, we are bringing two clubs to market - a driver and putter.</strong></p>

<p><strong><strong>Our driver head is constructed from nothing but the finest Titanium Alloy available. Its 15.3.3.3 variable thickness face allows you maximum trampoline effect to maximize your distance. Even with its spring-like effect, you will have the kind of power and control all golfers long for. The bulge and roll, along with the contour of the club face, will help you keep your fades from fading, and your hooks from hooking, allowing you to hit more shots from the fairway! This monster 460cc club face has a huge sweet spot that allows it to be one of the most forgiving drivers you will ever swing! </strong></strong></p>

Testing by Golf Laboratories, Inc. shows the Team Performance driver outdistancing the top 3 name brand manufacturers proving this driver is a game changer off the tee. This driver head is sure to improve your power, distance and control! </strong></strong></strong></p>

<p><strong><strong><strong><strong>The Team Performance Putter is constructed of high density aluminum alloy to provide you with the best feel possible when the ball impacts the club face. The symmetrical design has perfect weight distribution throughout the putter head. This feature combined with a center cut shaft club face design gives you perfect balance so you have a flawless putter stroke. Its big T-Line is designed to square up the club at impact so you have a better chance of hitting a straighter and accurate putt. Its beautiful modern design will help distinguish it as one of the premier putters on the market today.</strong></strong></strong></strong></p>

<strong>Who Is Aysia</strong> </div><p></p><p>Aysia is a 12 year-old girl who sustained a major hypoxic ischemic injury to the brain at birth. She is diagnosed with profound spastic quadriparetic cerebral palsy, which results in significant muscle tone impairment. Aysia is an exceptional person with an enormous, good-natured spirit. She is a highly social and joyful young lady who enjoys listening to music and interacting with her family and friends. Her smile is radiant and infectious. Highly motivated, her potential to succeed is unlimited. </p><p><b>Challenges of Not Having a Wheelchair Van </b></p><div>
</div><p>Although Aysia has made
some progress walking by taking steps with complete assistance, her quality of
life is threatened by unreliable transportation. As she continues to grow
physically, so do the challenges that we (mom and dad) are faced with. Her body
has become more difficult to lift and transfer, and her spasticity is harder to
overcome. She is at high risk for falls and fractures and requires the use of a
wheelchair for travel. </p><div>
</div><p>The functional transfers
that we perform regularly have become more complicated, increasing the risk of
injury to Aysia and her caregivers. Though the wheelchair affords her some
mobility, traveling via vehicle requires additional equipment. She needs a
wheelchair-adaptive van with a lift to carry her to and from doctor
appointments and community events, such as church and school. Without adaptive
equipment to ease the transfers, there’s always the chance of bodily injury. Because
of the high probability of this risk, Aysia is unable to attend private physical,
occupational and speech therapy. </p><div>
</div><p><b>Benefits
of Having a Wheelchair Van</b></p><div>
</div><p>This specialized
vehicle would be a tremendous help in taking Aysia to family gatherings and
continuous occupational, physical and speech therapy appointments. All of these
activities work collaboratively to allow Aysia to acquire new skills,
participate in community events, and improve her well-being. Limiting physical
strain during functional transfers will not only relieve us, but also improve
Aysia’s quality of life. </p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><p><b>The
Next Step</b></p><div>
</div><p>As Aysia’s parents, we will
do everything possible to improve her physical and emotional well-being. With
your help, we can raise the funding needed to get her a well-deserved
wheelchair van. So, let’s make it happen!</p><p><i>Your
assistance would be greatly appreciated! Thank you for reading! </i></p><div>
</div><p></p><div> </div> <div> </div>
<p><b><u>If We Don’t Reach
Our Goal</u></b></p>
<p>We will put the money in For the Life and Love of Aysia’s
savings until we reach our goal. One small donation will have life changing impact!</p><div>
</div> <div> </div><h3>The Impact</h3><div> </div><p></p><div>
</div><p>Aysia has lots of doctors’ appointments and loves being out
in the community. Your gift would make it much easier for her to travel to and
from these activities. She would be able to resume therapy sessions and enjoy
her surroundings. Your contribution will help mom, dad, and Aysia’s caregivers,
too. It makes a difference!</p><p></p><p> You can also contribute by check. Go to any</p><p>Wells Fargo Bank - <span>""Aysia Clements/ For the Life and Love of Aysia""</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span><br/></span></p>

wheelchair-adaptive van with a lift to carry her to and from doctor
appointments and community events, such as church and school. Without adaptive
equipment to ease the transfers, there’s always the chance of bodily injury. Because
of the high probability of this risk, Aysia is unable to attend private physical,
occupational and speech therapy. 
Benefits
of Having a Wheelchair Van
This specialized
vehicle would be a tremendous help in taking Aysia to family gatherings and
continuous occupational, physical and speech therapy appointments. All of these
activities work collaboratively to allow Aysia to acquire new skills,
participate in community events, and improve her well-being. Limiting physical
strain during functional transfers will not only relieve us, but also improve
Aysia’s quality of life. 

The
Next Step
As Aysia’s parents, we will
do everything possible to improve her physical and emotional well-being. With
your help, we can raise the funding needed to get her a well-deserved
wheelchair van. So, let’s make it happen!Your
assistance would be greatly appreciated! Thank you for reading! 
   
If We Don’t Reach
Our Goal
We will put the money in For the Life and Love of Aysia’s
savings until we reach our goal. One small donation will have life changing impact!
  The Impact 
Aysia has lots of doctors’ appointments and loves being out
in the community. Your gift would make it much easier for her to travel to and
from these activities. She would be able to resume therapy sessions and enjoy
her surroundings. Your contribution will help mom, dad, and Aysia’s caregivers,
too. It makes a difference! You can also contribute by check. Go to anyWells Fargo Bank - ""Aysia Clements/ For the Life and Love of Aysia""",0.0,1,"1 Campaign

drinking water, making everyday life extremely difficult. And with the 
government low on resources many communities seek to tackle the problem 
themselves.The PBS report above briefly explains some of the obstacles 
to fresh water encountered by many, and with the current Ebola outbreak 
and state of emergency declared in Monrovia, the country's capital, 
water has become even more scarce. <br/><br/>To solve this situation, the 
community in Barnesville, a short distance from central Monrovia, has 
mobilized and is organizing to build a water pump. The building and 
maintenance of the pump, done by the people of the community, will 
benefit all those living in the area, as there is currently no well. But
 in order to realize this essential goal, financial support is needed 
for the equipment, transportation and construction of the well. <br/><br/>To
 get water, people must walk into neighboring areas. With the 
restriction of movement due to the Ebola outbreak there are fewer and 
fewer options available. In addition to the distance and scarcity of 
water, there are also cases of well poisoning in wells that are not 
guarded, making drinking potentially life-threatening. This frustrating 
reality makes safe drinking water, which is a basic necessity, very hard
 to come by. A water pump owned and looked after by the community will 
alleviate the problem and empower the community, allowing us to address 
other problems and go on with their lives as healthier and happier 
people. For this, we kindly ask for your contribution! <br/></p><p></p><h3><br/></h3><h3>A Personal Story</h3><p>Omri Preiss, at the time a student living in the Netherlands, traveled to Ghana in 2006 to volunteer in Budubrum Refugee  Camp, home to a community of Liberians who had escaped the Civil Wars of the 1990s. There he met and worked with Emmanuel J. Toe, a teacher at the local primary school, and a Liberian refugee himself. Emmanuel was, and still is, a truly inspiring educator, who encouraged students to see themselves as the future of Liberia, with a responsibility to building a brighter future for their community. His vision, optimism and conviction were truly empowering. Omri and Emmanuel became friends, and stayed in touch in the years that followed. Emmanuel completed a business management diploma in Ghana, returned to Liberia together with many from Buduburam, and made a new home for his family in Barnesville. He continued to teach at the primary school there, while pursuing his own education, and working for his community.</p><p>Now, with our connection between Liberia and the Netherlands, we are trying to support Emmanuel's community in their efforts to rebuild their lives and achieve a higher quality of life together. This is a simple personal intitive, there are no big NGOs involved, and contributions you make will go directly to the community, entirely for the purpose of safe cleaning water. Please get in touch with us if you have any questions!    <br/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3>The Financial Side</h3><p></p><p>The majority of the money will go towards paying for the pump. The 
remainder is used for materials and equipment, transportation and 
construction. The whole process is overseen by trusted and known 
community workers, ensuring that all the money raised is directly and 
transparently invested in the project. </p>
<p>The total cost of the project is $1,800. The following is a detailed breakdown of where the money will go: 
</p><ul>
<li>The pump head - $800</li>
<li>10 bags of cement, $10 each - $100</li>
<li>Water pump machine to clean the well from dirty water - $100</li>
<li>12 covers to be placed in the well, $50 per cover - $600</li>
<li>Transportation from Monrovia to our community - $75</li>
<li>Workmanship and construction - $125</li>
</ul>
The community will use its own resources for the project, and 
continue to raise money to ensure the completion of the project.  Money 
is an important means to reach many social goals, so any excess money 
will be used for equally important purposes if that should be the case!<p><br/></p><p></p><h3>Contribute and Share!</h3><p>While there is currently little that we can offer in return for your 
generous help, we will be extremely grateful and appreciative of all who
 make a contribution for our cause. As you well know, water is vital for
 everyone, and you can directly contribute to the well-being of an entire
 community of people! This is something that will be felt by everyone in
 the community and for large donations we will send a personal card with
 pictures of the well once it is finished, as a token of our gratitude. <br/><br/>Your
 contributions will be greatly valued, but we understand that not 
everyone can contribute. If not, but still want to help us, let others 
know of our project and spread the word to individuals and organization 
who might be willing to help. In that way, you are also helping us make a
 change for the better! <br/></p></div>","Our Project: A community wellClick on the photo to see a great video telling the story of water.After years of civil war, Liberians still struggle to gain access to

is an important means to reach many social goals, so any excess money 
will be used for equally important purposes if that should be the case!Contribute and Share!While there is currently little that we can offer in return for your 
generous help, we will be extremely grateful and appreciative of all who
 make a contribution for our cause. As you well know, water is vital for
 everyone, and you can directly contribute to the well-being of an entire
 community of people! This is something that will be felt by everyone in
 the community and for large donations we will send a personal card with
 pictures of the well once it is finished, as a token of our gratitude. Your
 contributions will be greatly valued, but we understand that not 
everyone can contribute. If not, but still want to help us, let others 
know of our project and spread the word to individuals and organization 
who might be willing to help. In that way, you are also helping us make a
 change for the better!",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p><u>What We Do</u></p>
<p>Our work focuses on hard-to-reach and most-at-risk populations, orphaned and vulnerable children, youth and poor communities to improve their quality of life through responsive and innovative health programming, service delivery and capacity building in Kenya and Eastern Africa.  Through key partnerships with our local, national and international networks, we are continuously striving to improve the quality of our services and expand the range of our interventions.  We run a health clinic in Mukuru, an urban slum in Nairobi that served 1,200 slum residents free of charge in 2012. The majority of our clients come to the clinic requesting family planning services and STI (sexually transmitted infection) screening and treatment. Our medical professionals also treat a wide variety of other ailments and make referrals when more specialized medical services are required.  </p>
<p>We are dependent on donations in order to operate the health clinic.  Although we get some donations of medication from local pharmaceutical companies, most of the donated medications are given when they are close to expiration.  As a result, a large proportion of the donated medications need to be thrown away.  Our stock of medication is running low.  We are requesting your assistance in meeting our objective of continuing to provide free health care and medications to our clients who desperately need our services.  </p>

<p> </p>
<p><u>Why We Do It</u></p>
<p>Our services are greatly needed as we serve the most vulnerable at our clinic.  The unemployment rate in Kenya increased to 40% in 2011 from 12.7% in 2006. The majority of our clients have no reliable source of income and/or cannot afford to pay for needed medications themselves. Also, a sales tax increase was implemented nationwide in September that has further financially strained our clients.</p>
<p><u>How You Can Help</u></p>
<p>We are seeking $5,000 in funding, which would cover the cost of stocking our health clinic with medications for 1 year.  Your contribution towards our goal is greatly needed and appreciated.  If we do not meet our fundraising goal, all funds received will still go towards stocking our health clinic for as long as possible.</p>

<p>How could I know that a second heart attack will hit me again?</p><p>Can I have a test for assessing the risk of a heart attack prior to a non-heart related major surgery?</p><p><br/></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b><b></b></b></p><h3><b><b><b>Our solution </b></b></b></h3><p></p>
<p></p><p>Develop a fast and simple blood test for the early detection of a heart attack that can be performed at individual physician clinics, by home based nurse practitioners, by long-term care facility nurses, by nurses at senior centers, by emergency paramedics, etc.  The test format will be similar to the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy_test#mediaviewer/File:PositivePregnancyTest.JPG"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">pregnancy detection kit</a> that
is being widely used.  In a pregnancy
detection kit urine sample is used with specific reagents that detect a
pregnancy specific protein whereas; in our proposed kit, few drops of blood
sample will be used along with specific reagents for the detection of cardiac
ischemia and heart attack. Our proposed test kit will be easily accessible and can
be routinely performed outside of hospital laboratories.  It will significantly reduce
healthcare costs and save millions of lives.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b></b></p><h3><b><b>Our unique technology</b></b></h3><b> </b><p></p>
<p></p><p></p><p>A Point-of-Care Test (POCT) for the detection of
cardiac ischemia is not available.  Cardiac ischemia is resulted from blockage in coronary arteries (called atherosclerosis) that causes lack of oxygen and blood to the heart. Cardiac ischemia  is an early indicator of heart attack.  Chest pain is an early symptom of cardiac ischemia.  Some patients may survive their chest pains spontaneously, but, they are at high risk for short term heart attack (<a href=""http://www.mlo-online.com/articles/200306/the-ischemia-modified-albumin-biomarker-for-myocardial-ischemia.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Medical Laboratory Observer</a>).  These chest pains may also include inconsistent chest pain that comes and goes, which may be difficult to pinpoint since the pain may appear one day in neck, next day in your shoulder, left hand and jaw and none in next day.  <span> Cardiac ischemia can also occur without any symptoms, a phenomenon called
silent ischemia, which is common in diabetic patients.  ECG is the primary method of diagnosis, but, it has several limitations
in detecting cardiac ischemia <sup>(<a href=""http://qjmed.oxfordjournals.org/content/99/4/219.full"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a</a>) </sup> such ECG has only 60 % accuracy in detecting
cardiac ischemia<sup>(<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUl_I1iAHIM%20"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">b</a>) </sup>,   ECG may be abnormal or non-specific in
certain patients with cardiac ischemia or heart attack <sup>(<a href=""http://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiogram-in-the-diagnosis-of-myocardial-ischemia-and-infarction"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">c</a>) </sup> and in some cases ECG may be normal. </span></p><p>Most of the currently available tests for the detection of heart attack are based on troponin detection.  However, troponin test may not be the best suitable test for the early detection of heart attack because increased levels of troponin in blood can be detected only after the heart muscles are damaged due to a heart attack. Very high levels of troponin in blood indicate that a heart attack has occurred.  It may take approximately 6 hours to detect increased levels of troponin in patients who have had a heart attack.  Therefore, our goal will be to detect early signs of heart attack before the occurrence of heart damage or a heart attack. <br/></p><p></p><p>With the combination of cardiac ischemia detection and other blood markers of heart attack detection, our technology will have direct application in detecting cardiac ischemia and heart attack in three different medical situations:</p><p>(1) The classical case where the individual presents with chest pain/angina.</p><p>(2) The individual has no observable symptoms traditionally associated with heart attack, but has recently had a silent cardiac ischemia and heart attack, which is not diagnosed with current methods. </p><p>(3) The individual has not had a heart attack, but has a personal history of heart attack, or a family history of heart attack, and conservative, prudent medical care would suggest a cardiac catheterization be performed, unnecessarily.</p><br/><p></p><p></p><h3>What are the

<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b><span></span></b></p><h3><b><b><b><b><b>A. </b><b>OUR TECHNOLOGY- HOW DOES IT WORK?</b></b></b></b></b></h3><b><span></span></b><p></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<p><i>Rationale behind our technology</i>:   There are specific markers which appear in blood when
cardiac ischemia occurs, some of these markers can be detected in blood within
6 minutes after their onset and stays up to 6 -12 hours.  Currently, multiple tests are performed for identifying cardiac
ischemia (ACB®
Test) and heart attack (troponin, CK-MB, H-FABP etc.), along with ECG and
imaging.  We will also include H1Ac (glycated hemoglobin) test along with other cardiac markers in the same strip, specifically for diabetic patients. These tests are time consuming, need trained medical professionals and
require biomedical instruments for interpreting results.  Our idea is to combine
all these tests in one strip (Fig. 2), in a <span>Point-of-Care Test (POCT) format </span>that can be
performed by any medical or non-medical professional at any place without the
need of an instrument; and the results can be seen visually within 10-15
minutes.  The format will be similar to the
pregnancy detection kit that is being widely used. The difference is, in
pregnancy detection kit <sup><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy_test#mediaviewer/File:PositivePregnancyTest.JPG"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy_test#mediaviewer/File:PositivePregnancyTest.JPG"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">4</a></sup> urine
sample is used with specific reagents that detect a pregnancy specific protein.   In our kit, blood sample will be used along with specific reagents for the
detection of cardiac ischemia and heart attack.   A working model of our proposed POCT technology is shown in Fig. 2.   Patient blood sample will be added to sample application zone and the sample will be migrated towards the end of the POCT device (10-15 minutes).   Based on the color development at preset zones, incidence of cardiac ischemia, progression to heart attack and occurrence of heart attack can be detected.</p><p><br/></p><p><b></b></p><p><b><i></i></b></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/635689/files/20140609051618-POCT.png?1402316178"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><i><b>              </b></i></p><p><i><b>                   </b>Fig. 2:   A working model of our proposed  POCT technology.</i></p><p></p>
<p></p>
<p><i><span><br/></span></i></p><p><i><span>What is our patent
pending invention?    </span></i><span>Our core invention
is on the development of a scientific technology of FDA approved </span>ACB® Test <span>in a Point-of-Care test (POCT) format, which is not
otherwise possible without our invention (details of Point-of-Care test (POCT) and ACB® Test are explained in the
Appendix section).  </span>The <span>ACB® Test is the only one US
FDA approved test for detecting cardiac ischemia.  </span>This test is approved with an instruction that
it should be used in conjunction with ECG
and cardiac troponin to detect the short term risk stratification of patients
presenting with chest pain with cardiac complications <sup><a href=""http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpcd/classification.cfm?ID=617"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">10</a></sup><span>.   </span>Our technology for the detection of ischemia will also be
combined with our patent pending technology related to a method for high sensitive
detection of proteins.  The development of a method for the detection of cardiac
ischemia  in a POCT format will open up an unique opportunity for us to
develop a technology for the simultaneous detection of cardiac ischemia and
heart attack, especially for detecting progression of heart attack from cardiac ischemia. </p>
<p><i>Format and method of detection</i>:   A schematic diagram of
the proposed technology is shown in Fig. 3.  According to the proposed method,
patient’s blood (few drops) will be added to the sample loading well in the
POCT device.  Patient’s status of ischemia or progression towards heart attack
will be detected in a single test using a single strip.  </p>

<p>According to a new report from BCC Research, the
global market for in vitro diagnostic tests for cardiac biomarkers is expected
to grow to $7.2 billion by 2018 with a five-year compound annual growth rate
(CAGR) of 12.8% <sup><a href=""http://www.prweb.com/releases/2014/03/prweb11713830.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">15</a><u></u></sup>.   Of this 7.2 billion, $3.1 billion is in the US with a CAGR of 9.6%.   Point-of-Care testing has been identified as the growing
market for cardiac markers. Troponin is the
leading marker used in the detection of heart attacks or myocardial infarctions
(MI).  The worldwide market for cardiac troponin testing is estimated to be
$1.2 billion (with 12% annual growth rate).   Point-of-Care market for
troponin tests carried out in the emergency room (ER) is approximately $350 M
and the rest is for laboratory-based testing <sup><a href=""http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2014/01/29/605602/10066003/en/Trinity-Biotech-Announces-European-Approval-of-Guideline-Compliant-Point-of-Care-High-Sensitivity-Troponin-I-Product.html#sthash.cEP6fpX4.dpuf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">16</a></sup>.  The potential market
size of our technology, with a combination of two or more tests in a single

<p></p></div>","A YouTube video from Lee Memorial Health System- Cardiology: Do You Know The Warning Signs of Heart Disease?
Your questions?Do I need to wait until a heart attack hits me with symptoms?How do I know that my chest pain will not lead to a heart attack?
Can I have a heart attack detection test that can be done routinely
without worrying about the cost?Can I just walk into my doctor's office and do a test for identifying early signs of a heart attack?
How could I know that a second heart attack will hit me again?Can I have a test for assessing the risk of a heart attack prior to a non-heart related major surgery?
Our solution 
Develop a fast and simple blood test for the early detection of a heart attack that can be performed at individual physician clinics, by home based nurse practitioners, by long-term care facility nurses, by nurses at senior centers, by emergency paramedics, etc.  The test format will be similar to the pregnancy detection kit that
is being widely used.  In a pregnancy
detection kit urine sample is used with specific reagents that detect a
pregnancy specific protein whereas; in our proposed kit, few drops of blood
sample will be used along with specific reagents for the detection of cardiac
ischemia and heart attack. Our proposed test kit will be easily accessible and can
be routinely performed outside of hospital laboratories.  It will significantly reduce
healthcare costs and save millions of lives.Our unique technology 
A Point-of-Care Test (POCT) for the detection of
cardiac ischemia is not available.  Cardiac ischemia is resulted from blockage in coronary arteries (called atherosclerosis) that causes lack of oxygen and blood to the heart. Cardiac ischemia  is an early indicator of heart attack.  Chest pain is an early symptom of cardiac ischemia.  Some patients may survive their chest pains spontaneously, but, they are at high risk for short term heart attack (Medical Laboratory Observer).  These chest pains may also include inconsistent chest pain that comes and goes, which may be difficult to pinpoint since the pain may appear one day in neck, next day in your shoulder, left hand and jaw and none in next day.   Cardiac ischemia can also occur without any symptoms, a phenomenon called
silent ischemia, which is common in diabetic patients.  ECG is the primary method of diagnosis, but, it has several limitations
in detecting cardiac ischemia (a)  such ECG has only 60 % accuracy in detecting
cardiac ischemia(b) ,   ECG may be abnormal or non-specific in
certain patients with cardiac ischemia or heart attack (c)  and in some cases ECG may be normal. Most of the currently available tests for the detection of heart attack are based on troponin detection.  However, troponin test may not be the best suitable test for the early detection of heart attack because increased levels of troponin in blood can be detected only after the heart muscles are damaged due to a heart attack. Very high levels of troponin in blood indicate that a heart attack has occurred.  It may take approximately 6 hours to detect increased levels of troponin in patients who have had a heart attack.  Therefore, our goal will be to detect early signs of heart attack before the occurrence of heart damage or a heart attack. With the combination of cardiac ischemia detection and other blood markers of heart attack detection, our technology will have direct application in detecting cardiac ischemia and heart attack in three different medical situations:(1) The classical case where the individual presents with chest pain/angina.(2) The individual has no observable symptoms traditionally associated with heart attack, but has recently had a silent cardiac ischemia and heart attack, which is not diagnosed with current methods. (3) The individual has not had a heart attack, but has a personal history of heart attack, or a family history of heart attack, and conservative, prudent medical care would suggest a cardiac catheterization be performed, unnecessarily.What are the
benefits of early detection of heart attack? “In a heart attack, every minute that passes
causes more of the heart muscle to die”- Circulation.“About
47% of sudden cardiac deaths occur outside a hospital. This suggests that
many people with heart disease don't act on early warning signs”-Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).“To receive the best care, you have about 90 minutes from the onset of the heart attack for an interventional cardiologist or surgeon to restore the flow of blood to the heart before critical heart tissue dies or is damaged”- The Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI).""Half of deaths due to a heart attack occur in the first 3 or 4 hours after symptoms begin. The sooner treatment begins, the better the chances of survival""- Merck Manual. “Chances of surviving a heart attack can improve when an individual recognizes the symptoms early and seeks immediate medical attention”-Cedars-Sinai.
""The beneficial effect of fibrinolytic therapy is substantially higher in patients presenting within 2 h after symptom onset compared to those presenting later""(Golden hour) - The Lancet.“All regular cardiovascular screening tests
should begin at age 20. The frequency of follow up will depend on your level of
risk”–
American Heart Association.

“Eighty-five
percent of heart damage occurs within the first two hours of a heart attack, so
early detection and treatment is the key to saving lives”- Johnston Health.
“Routine lipid testing can miss up to 75% these people. Panels of blood tests that look beyond cholesterol and triglycerides can catch 90% or more of people headed for cardiovascular disease”- Naturalchoice.“Heart disease early detection can save the U.S. healthcare system tremendous amounts. Hundreds of billions of dollars can be saved, both direct and indirectly. Reducing the cost and resource burden on the system can help Medicare/Medicaid solvency, reduce our national debt, or enable a focus on other diseases”- Heartsavers Clinic.“The
sudden, unexpected loss of a friend or loved one can be one of the most
difficult things to cope with. While most losses are devastating, a sudden loss
can leave us feeling uncertain, anxious, and vulnerable about life and the
future”-Joleen Watson.Key features of our proposed test for the early detection of heart attack  (Patent pending technology)•  Three separate tests in a single test strip•  Detection of early signs of heart attack and progression of heart attack•  Results within 15 minutes•  Test can be performed outside of hospital laboratories•  Testing can be routinely performed•  Easily accessible to anyone•  Cost-effectiveThree different tests can be done in a single test strip using our proposed early heart attack detection test
We will develop a single test that
can identify early symptoms of heart attack, chances of having a heart attack
down the road, progression towards heart attack and occurrence of a heart
attack.  These tests are approved by US FDA or similar agencies worldwide
and are being currently used in hospital laboratories for the diagnosis of heart
attack.  However, these tests are done separately and it takes
longer time.  A single rapid test for simultaneous detection of cardiac
ischemia, progression of heart attack and occurrence of heart attack is not
currently available.  Though the US FDA approved cardiac ischemia test was
discovered almost 24 years back, but till now a strip format fast detection test
for cardiac ischemia is not available.  We will make it possible through
our patent pending invention. Early indicator molecules of heart attack that appear in blood at different stages of heart attack will be tested simultaneously We have developed a technology
that can be used for the detection of reversible cardiac ischemia indicator
molecules in blood (patent pending). This can be used for the detection of
early signs of heart attack.  We will develop a single test to identify
indicator molecules of cardiac ischemia, transition towards heart attack and
occurrence of a heart attack present in blood samples.Following is an animated video showing our proposed Point-of-Care Test (POCT) for the early detection of cardiac ischemia and heart attack.Surprising stories and facts about heart attacks""Young women fare worse than young men after heart attack""- American Heart Association Meeting Report Abstract June 2014.“I finally went to the ER and recited my symptoms to the nurse. The
doctor who examined me wanted to give me some Motrin and send me home, never
ordering any tests. I knew something was terribly wrong with me and demanded to
be given some kind of test. I looked above me and saw an EKG and asked to have
one”- Having a Heart Attack at 30.Too Young to Have a Heart Attack :
Story of Diane Harrington where her EKG looked normal. “The lesson is that just because someone is not “old” that does not mean that symptoms such as chest pain and shortness of breath are not signs of a heart attack”- Can young people have heart attacks?
“The
ambulance arrived, and the crew checked me over. They managed to calm me down a
little and took an ECG (a measurement of the heartbeat). They said there was a
slight abnormality, but because of my young age (36) and the fact that I led a
healthy lifestyle and there was no family history of heart problems, they were
happy to rule out anything serious there and then. Even so, we decided I should
go to hospital immediately to get properly checked out. After a few hours, I
was let home – with some indigestion medicine”- My heart attack at 36.“Harvard
Men’s Health Watch reminds men that they should not ignore heart attack warning
symptoms just because they are “too young” to have heart disease, and that
prevention should start early”- Why do some young men have heart attacks?“If you think you're
too young for a heart attack, you need to confront the scary truth: Every year
about 40,000 American women under age 55 are hospitalized for heart disease,
and 16,000 of them die. What's more, younger women's heart attacks are fatal
twice as often as men's. In fact, women who are 35 to 44 are the only Americans
whose coronary heart disease mortality is rising (by 1.3 percent a year),
according to a new study in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology”.“Heart attack risk
goes up in men older than 45 and women older than 55, but it can happen even
earlier”- Heart attacks can happen at any age.
“Women age 55 or younger may
fare worse than their male counterparts after having a heart attack”- Young women fare worse than young men after heart attack.
""Where's
the 34-year-old who had the massive heart attack?"" I had emergency
surgery. But the damage was done; only part of my heart muscle functions. I had
to quit a job I loved, and my life is completely changed. They thought I was
too young to have a heart attack”- Angela's story.
“Chest pain was the most
common symptom of heart attack in both sexes, researchers found that one in
five women age 55 and younger didn't experience chest pain with their heart
attack. Plus, women in general were less likely to experience chest pain from
heart attack than men”- Heart Attacks In Young Women Don't Always Cause Chest Pain.

A. OUR TECHNOLOGY- HOW DOES IT WORK?

Rationale behind our technology:   There are specific markers which appear in blood when
cardiac ischemia occurs, some of these markers can be detected in blood within
6 minutes after their onset and stays up to 6 -12 hours.  Currently, multiple tests are performed for identifying cardiac
ischemia (ACB®
Test) and heart attack (troponin, CK-MB, H-FABP etc.), along with ECG and
imaging.  We will also include H1Ac (glycated hemoglobin) test along with other cardiac markers in the same strip, specifically for diabetic patients. These tests are time consuming, need trained medical professionals and
require biomedical instruments for interpreting results.  Our idea is to combine
all these tests in one strip (Fig. 2), in a Point-of-Care Test (POCT) format that can be
performed by any medical or non-medical professional at any place without the
need of an instrument; and the results can be seen visually within 10-15
minutes.  The format will be similar to the
pregnancy detection kit that is being widely used. The difference is, in
pregnancy detection kit 4 urine
sample is used with specific reagents that detect a pregnancy specific protein.   In our kit, blood sample will be used along with specific reagents for the
detection of cardiac ischemia and heart attack.   A working model of our proposed POCT technology is shown in Fig. 2.   Patient blood sample will be added to sample application zone and the sample will be migrated towards the end of the POCT device (10-15 minutes).   Based on the color development at preset zones, incidence of cardiac ischemia, progression to heart attack and occurrence of heart attack can be detected.                                 Fig. 2:   A working model of our proposed  POCT technology.

What is our patent
pending invention?    Our core invention
is on the development of a scientific technology of FDA approved ACB® Test in a Point-of-Care test (POCT) format, which is not
otherwise possible without our invention (details of Point-of-Care test (POCT) and ACB® Test are explained in the
Appendix section).  The ACB® Test is the only one US
FDA approved test for detecting cardiac ischemia.  This test is approved with an instruction that
it should be used in conjunction with ECG
and cardiac troponin to detect the short term risk stratification of patients
presenting with chest pain with cardiac complications 10.   Our technology for the detection of ischemia will also be
combined with our patent pending technology related to a method for high sensitive
detection of proteins.  The development of a method for the detection of cardiac
ischemia  in a POCT format will open up an unique opportunity for us to
develop a technology for the simultaneous detection of cardiac ischemia and
heart attack, especially for detecting progression of heart attack from cardiac ischemia. 
Format and method of detection:   A schematic diagram of
the proposed technology is shown in Fig. 3.  According to the proposed method,
patient’s blood (few drops) will be added to the sample loading well in the
POCT device.  Patient’s status of ischemia or progression towards heart attack
will be detected in a single test using a single strip.

heart attack 11 and proposed POCT method of detection.

B. FUND REQUESTED 
Amount requested:  US$250,000.00The funds raised through this campaign will be used for developing a POCT prototype and will be used only for the technology development, primarily for the optimization of reagents and detection conditions, not for any kind of research on finding new markers for the early detection of cardiac ischemia or heart attack.  It should be pointed out that the final product needs the approval of US FDA and regulatory bodies in other countries.  Therefore, the goal of this project is to develop a prototype that leads to development of a final product that may satisfy all of the guidelines proposed by the world's leading cardiac organizations and meet all the requirements of regulatory bodies.Purpose of the amount requested:  Laboratory reagents and other consumables, consultant fees, capital instruments, point-of-care device components and salaries.Achievable goal:  This funding will be used to develop our core invention, a prototype of non-clinical Point-of-Care Test (POCT) device for the detection of ischemia.  The reagents and materials used for developing this prototype will not be clinical grade reagents.  To reduce costs, commercially available research-grade reagents (as opposed to costly clinical-grade reagents) will be used.

PROPERTY ON THE PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY
Patent pending2.   BUSINESS PERSPECTIVES OF
THE PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY

According to a new report from BCC Research, the
global market for in vitro diagnostic tests for cardiac biomarkers is expected
to grow to $7.2 billion by 2018 with a five-year compound annual growth rate
(CAGR) of 12.8% 15.   Of this 7.2 billion, $3.1 billion is in the US with a CAGR of 9.6%.   Point-of-Care testing has been identified as the growing
market for cardiac markers. Troponin is the
leading marker used in the detection of heart attacks or myocardial infarctions
(MI).  The worldwide market for cardiac troponin testing is estimated to be
$1.2 billion (with 12% annual growth rate).   Point-of-Care market for
troponin tests carried out in the emergency room (ER) is approximately $350 M
and the rest is for laboratory-based testing 16.  The potential market
size of our technology, with a combination of two or more tests in a single
platform, would likely be higher than the current market for testing just
troponin alone.",18.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Our History</strong><br/>Last February the team put together a shoot concept for Eating Disorder Awareness Week, in which the models would pose in purple tops and write inspirational words on their bodies to bring awareness to the fact that eating disorders affect those of all body types and ethnicities.  </p>
<p><br/>That photoshoot was a catalyst to a conversation between team members, models, critics and supporters, friends and family, about representation and perception of different body types, not only in the modeling industry, but in society in general. A common comment was that after a certain size or age you stopped seeing positive representations in the media and often overweight or older subjects were cast in a negative light. This is an issue that needs to be talked about. Weight and age do not define your worth as a person, nor should your dress size determine your beauty and confidence. </p>
<p><br/>As a team we decided to do the Photoshoot again, but this time as its own campaign separate from eating disorder awareness, focusing on positive body image and diversity of body types. <br/><br/>The Title “EveryBODY is Beautiful” was contributed by stylist Alexa Kellee, and fits our cause perfectly. Our calendar will show that every body truly is beautiful, and the diversity of our models reflects that. <br/><br/></p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1287.photobucket.com/albums/a638/EveryBODYisbeautiful/IMG_4156.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Team</strong><br/><br/><strong>Founder/Producer/ Talent co-ordinator/ Model/ etc, etc, etc.</strong> <br/><br/>Myself! My name is Megan Babee and I am a local model and activist located in Vancouver. This cause is very close to my heart and I am so grateful for all of the support it has received thus far. I dreamt up this idea with the help of my best friend and fellow model Devan Newman, but I never imagined it would have become such a passion. This project has shown me a new side to myself. Producing the calendar and Co-ordinating the team has been both exhausting and exhilarating. Every moment spent working on this project is a moment I cherish. I hope that this calendar will inspire others the way the amazing people I have met during this process have inspired me.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Photography:</strong><br/>Alex Waber is a local Vancouver photographer, he has a natural talent for capturing his subjects personality in every photo. Professional but lighthearted, Alex has a way with models that made him an easy choice for this project. Since agreeing to shoot for us last February he has become an essential part of this team and of this project. <br/><br/>Also a big thank you to our behind the scenes photographer and interviewer Alex Larente, Alex has also modeled for both shoots and being my better half has helped keep me calm during my mini stress attacks and has had a major part in putting all of this together. He also discovered he has an innate talent for draping fabric during the shoots!<br/><br/><strong>Makeup:</strong> <br/>We have some amazing Makeup artists working with us on this project, One I would like to thank in particular is Candice Harvey, Candice volunteered at last Februarys shoot and did makeup at all three of our shoots this year. Without her we would not have been able to run things so smoothly, thank you Candice! </p>
<p><br/>Our other wonderful MUA’s are Tatiana Tavares, Alicia Mizel, Candice Johnson and Elizabeth Mcleod. We were lucky to have such a talented team to help pamper our models. <br/><br/></p>

<p><br/><br/>The Photoshoot for the calendar took place over three days in November, the 14th, 15th and 25th. The studio environment was relaxed and upbeat, the models and makeup artists had a seating area to hang out and chat in between shooting which helped to relax the models and get them ready for their turn in front of the camera.</p>

<p><strong>Why a Calendar and where your money is going.</strong><br/><br/>This time we wanted to do a fundraiser and a Calendar is a fun way to raise money and simultaneously raise awareness. A calendar is something you display proudly in your home, and something you see basically everyday. We want to remind our supporters everyday that everyBODY is beautiful and a calendar is a perfect fit.<br/><br/>Where is your money going?<br/><br/>The money we raise will be going toward a few different things,<br/><br/><strong>Printing costs.</strong> This is where this indiegogo campaign comes into play, we can’t sell the calendars without first having the funds. Your donations will go toward printing the first batch of calendars and making this project a reality. </p>
<p><br/><strong>Paying for costs and the launch event.</strong> Our team and models have dedicated their time and in some cases their money to helping make this project its best. We want to reimburse costs that have come up during production and thank our models by putting together a launch event for them to celebrate. We have local performers and a wonderful nutritionist ready to perform/speak at the event and we would like to be able to pay their costs. We also need to pay for catering and permits involved in the event. </p>
<p><br/><strong>Funding the next project!</strong> We are planning a workshop project in the spring, a few fundraising events, and our 2014 Calendar is already in the planning stage, but we need funds to make these things happen!</p>
<p><br/><strong>Giving Back.</strong> If we raise above and beyond our goal we will only keep what we can put to use. This is first and foremost a non-profit project to raise awareness and without your help we would be nowhere, so we will donate the remainder to Project True Centre for Body image and Eating disorder recovery. <br/><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1287.photobucket.com/albums/a638/EveryBODYisbeautiful/LoveYourBodyday1_0328.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

Our HistoryLast February the team put together a shoot concept for Eating Disorder Awareness Week, in which the models would pose in purple tops and write inspirational words on their bodies to bring awareness to the fact that eating disorders affect those of all body types and ethnicities.  
That photoshoot was a catalyst to a conversation between team members, models, critics and supporters, friends and family, about representation and perception of different body types, not only in the modeling industry, but in society in general. A common comment was that after a certain size or age you stopped seeing positive representations in the media and often overweight or older subjects were cast in a negative light. This is an issue that needs to be talked about. Weight and age do not define your worth as a person, nor should your dress size determine your beauty and confidence. 
As a team we decided to do the Photoshoot again, but this time as its own campaign separate from eating disorder awareness, focusing on positive body image and diversity of body types. The Title “EveryBODY is Beautiful” was contributed by stylist Alexa Kellee, and fits our cause perfectly. Our calendar will show that every body truly is beautiful, and the diversity of our models reflects that. 
TeamFounder/Producer/ Talent co-ordinator/ Model/ etc, etc, etc. Myself! My name is Megan Babee and I am a local model and activist located in Vancouver. This cause is very close to my heart and I am so grateful for all of the support it has received thus far. I dreamt up this idea with the help of my best friend and fellow model Devan Newman, but I never imagined it would have become such a passion. This project has shown me a new side to myself. Producing the calendar and Co-ordinating the team has been both exhausting and exhilarating. Every moment spent working on this project is a moment I cherish. I hope that this calendar will inspire others the way the amazing people I have met during this process have inspired me.
Photography:Alex Waber is a local Vancouver photographer, he has a natural talent for capturing his subjects personality in every photo. Professional but lighthearted, Alex has a way with models that made him an easy choice for this project. Since agreeing to shoot for us last February he has become an essential part of this team and of this project. Also a big thank you to our behind the scenes photographer and interviewer Alex Larente, Alex has also modeled for both shoots and being my better half has helped keep me calm during my mini stress attacks and has had a major part in putting all of this together. He also discovered he has an innate talent for draping fabric during the shoots!Makeup: We have some amazing Makeup artists working with us on this project, One I would like to thank in particular is Candice Harvey, Candice volunteered at last Februarys shoot and did makeup at all three of our shoots this year. Without her we would not have been able to run things so smoothly, thank you Candice! 
Our other wonderful MUA’s are Tatiana Tavares, Alicia Mizel, Candice Johnson and Elizabeth Mcleod. We were lucky to have such a talented team to help pamper our models. 
 
The Photoshoot for the calendar took place over three days in November, the 14th, 15th and 25th. The studio environment was relaxed and upbeat, the models and makeup artists had a seating area to hang out and chat in between shooting which helped to relax the models and get them ready for their turn in front of the camera.

Why a Calendar and where your money is going.This time we wanted to do a fundraiser and a Calendar is a fun way to raise money and simultaneously raise awareness. A calendar is something you display proudly in your home, and something you see basically everyday. We want to remind our supporters everyday that everyBODY is beautiful and a calendar is a perfect fit.Where is your money going?The money we raise will be going toward a few different things,Printing costs. This is where this indiegogo campaign comes into play, we can’t sell the calendars without first having the funds. Your donations will go toward printing the first batch of calendars and making this project a reality. 
Paying for costs and the launch event. Our team and models have dedicated their time and in some cases their money to helping make this project its best. We want to reimburse costs that have come up during production and thank our models by putting together a launch event for them to celebrate. We have local performers and a wonderful nutritionist ready to perform/speak at the event and we would like to be able to pay their costs. We also need to pay for catering and permits involved in the event. 
Funding the next project! We are planning a workshop project in the spring, a few fundraising events, and our 2014 Calendar is already in the planning stage, but we need funds to make these things happen!
Giving Back. If we raise above and beyond our goal we will only keep what we can put to use. This is first and foremost a non-profit project to raise awareness and without your help we would be nowhere, so we will donate the remainder to Project True Centre for Body image and Eating disorder recovery.

<h3><strong>Brandon is a wonderful young man who could use your help.</strong></h3>
<p><strong> Hi am Brandon's Mom and am asking for some help for him in getting his medical bills paid. Brandon does have health insurance but his out of pocket expenses with be in the thousands. I am hoping by raising money it will help in his recovery and he will not feel he has to over do it now that he is allowed back to work.</strong></p>
<p><strong> Brandon is 22 yrs old and works and goes to college. He was sitting in class at the end of November when he became ill. He said he felt he was having a stroke. He got dizzy, body chills, headache, neck, chest and back pains. I live out of state and my ex husband called saying Brandon was in the hospital with a collapsed LUNG. The doctors found a hole in his lung and that he would have to have it repaired. Brandon underwent surgery to repair it 2 days later. As a parent you never want your child to be sick and in pain. The surgery was Brandon's 4th major surgery in 7 yrs. When he was 15 he had to have his rib cage repaired to fix his sunken chest as it was affecting his heart and lungs. They did this by inserting a  bar into his chest. At 16 this bar was removed. When he was 17 he was cleared to play HS football and during his first practice he shattered his right pelvis and broke the head of his femur. He had to under go a 6.5 hr surgery to repair all the damage and is now my bionic boy. He missed his first month of his senior year and spent almost 4 months in a wheel chair.  I am very proud as he has faced them all with courage and humor. They say laughter is the best medicine and he was able to laugh even through the pain of a collapsed lung. He even had me laughing to ease my worries. The morning of the surgery I asked him what he was doing as I was unable to be there. He said SINGING and I  asked how is that..he said I am singing but not as LOUD as I normally do. He put a huge smile on my face and now I would like to do the same for him and am asking for your help in doing it.</strong></p>
<p><strong> Of course his father and I will do our best to help him pay his bills but I know we will fall short. I am hoping that Brandon will not have to start his adult life off with this unexpected financial burden. </strong></p>
<p><strong> I was very blessed that he was well enough to come for an early Christmas visit. His incisions are healing well and his energy level has returned. He still gets a little winded after climbing stairs but I am sure he will be back to normal soon.</strong></p>
<p><strong>THANK YOU for reading Brandon's story. Any donation we would be  grateful for. I would like to wish everyone a Blessed New Year and that it will find you and yours happy and healthy. </strong></p>

On these trips are people who are in fields such as education, medicine, and construction, and some who don't have specific skills, but do whatever is needed.   <strong>My name is Mary Anne, a pediatric nurse who lives in Maplewood, NJ., and a volunteer with </strong>AOV.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Along with our American volunteers, we have a few volunteers from Ghana.</strong></p>
<p><strong>One such volunteer is Frank Temeng. </strong><strong>We met Frank, who lives in Accra,   </strong><strong>(a 3 to 5 hour drive to the village) in 2010, when he was hired as our driver.  He has since become an integral part of our team, often giving up his own ""vacation"" time to be a volunteer.  In addition to loading and carrying our luggage, he translates for us, helped repair a roof, painted classrooms, put up new chalkboards, taught and sang with children in the village, and even did our laundry, along with various other tasks! He gives of himself because he believes in our vision, and because his heart is full of love.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Several months ago, he began having serious pain and was found to have two large hernias.  Despite this, he still came to work and serve with us in the village in July 2012. By the end of the day, he was in visible pain, but never complained and still performed much work. It is getting harder for him to keep up and it is affecting his job as a driver in the capital city.</strong></p>
<p><strong>My personal involvement with Frank started in 2010 when he acted as translator for some of the patients we saw in the clinic that AOV helped build.  He is a man of great integrity, honor, and humility, always willing to do whatever is asked of him.  I was so impressed by his sweetness and generosity, I ""adopted"" him like a son. On our recent trip, he took charge of cleaning equipment in the clinic, and managed to involve a large group of men from the village to step up to the task.  He is a natural leader who inspires others.  </strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>The impact of our medical care and donations and teacher training is evident in the inspiration of the people of the village, and the decrease in wounds as bare feet are now covered by shoes!  <strong>We have helped make a great difference in this village of Yaw Tenkorang, and Frank has been an essential part of that difference.</strong></strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>But health care in Ghana is not the best. With a wife and 3 children to support on a meager income, Frank does not have the money for the needed surgery. Because Frank is such a good and humble man, we want to help him get this surgery as a way of showing our gratitude for his self-less service to our organization and the village we serve.  (We also need him for our future trips, and his family needs him as their bread-winner!)</strong></p>
<p><strong>We want to bring him to the US for his surgery, where we know he will have a chance of better care.  We have volunteers who will house him during his stay, and some of the funds will sustain his family while he recuperates.</strong></p>

<p><span>We are a contemporary and forward-thinking personalised silk pyjama company, aimed at bringing you the height of luxury at a price that won’t give you nightmares. We want to give you a happier and more comfortable sleep, while at the same time promoting good social behaviour by giving back to those in need.</span></p>
<p>Someone very wise once said that “it does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live” (yes you muggles, it was Dumbledore). But what about those who live in fear? At Snooze we have adopted the opposite approach, namely to help people live so that they have the freedom to dream. For every PJ bought we will donate a mosquito net to a child in Kenya who is at risk of catching Malaria.  Mosquito nets are the most effective and efficient means in which malaria can be prevented, and has the potential to save thousands of lives.</p>

<span>Because two of our team members grew up in Southern and Eastern Africa, Malaria is a cause very close to our hearts. They witnessed first hand the destructive consequences of such an easily preventable disease. One of the members has even had malaria twice and knows the consequences despite having access to medication instantly. According to the World Health Organisation, in 2015, there were 214 million new cases of malaria worldwide, with the African Region accounting for 88% of those. In 2015 alone there were roughly 438 000 malaria deaths worldwide. Considering that malaria bearing mosquitos usually bite between 10pm and 2am, sleeping children are especially vulnerable, and we at SNOOZE. believe that everyone should have the right to a safe sleep. This is why for every pyjama sold we pledge to donate a mosquito net to Africa’s largest urban slum (Kibera in Nairobi, Kenya), in the fight against malaria. Mosquito nets are a simple, long lasting and effective way to help protect people from this horrible disease when they’re at their most vulnerable. </span><br/><p></p>

</div></div>","Hello Friends! We’re here to ask you to help us, to help you, to help others by purchasing our pyjamas. So brush away the sleepy dust, stretch, have a coffee and give us 5 minutes of your time to lend us a hand in launching the start-up of our dreams.   

We are a contemporary and forward-thinking personalised silk pyjama company, aimed at bringing you the height of luxury at a price that won’t give you nightmares. We want to give you a happier and more comfortable sleep, while at the same time promoting good social behaviour by giving back to those in need.
Someone very wise once said that “it does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live” (yes you muggles, it was Dumbledore). But what about those who live in fear? At Snooze we have adopted the opposite approach, namely to help people live so that they have the freedom to dream. For every PJ bought we will donate a mosquito net to a child in Kenya who is at risk of catching Malaria.  Mosquito nets are the most effective and efficient means in which malaria can be prevented, and has the potential to save thousands of lives.

 
Behold a few pictures of our luxurious personalised silk pyjamas. Also make sure to watch our campaign video featuring our delightful model Jenna!

<p>Hello deep freediving addicts!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After the <strong>huge success of our first pulley system</strong> released in 2018, today we are super happy and <strong>proud to introduce its big brother</strong> to the freediving world : The<strong> XL </strong>pulling system!</p>
<p>Indeed, a few of our customers and friends mentioned that when using our first pulley model with stiffer or thicker ropes (10mm and above), sometimes pulling the bottom weight up by securing the sole of the foot on the carabiner felt a little bit too much like hard work. This is why we came up with this new XL model, <strong>using double-diameter pulleys</strong>. This significantly <strong>decreases the friction</strong> due to the angle of the rope against the pulley. As for everything else, <strong>it works in exactly the same way as the original model.</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1590261021/dh7cewa11zkfbqr2cvdb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">As always, it remains <strong>easy to use</strong>, <strong>strong</strong> (max. load 250kg), <strong>efficient</strong>, <strong>ergonomic</strong>, and still compact even if a bit chunkier than our CLASSIC model, and <strong>at an affordable price</strong> while <strong>maintaining high-quality components</strong> and finish!</span></p>
<p>It is so resistant that you can just leave it hanging under your buoy, without any real need to rinse it in fresh water after use. You can even jump on it with both feet, it will keep working over and over (with any rope from 8 to 13 mm diameter)!</p>
<p>Finally, it will enable you <strong>to pull the line up way more efficiently in case of an emergency.</strong></p>
<p>It makes it easy to drop the line even with just one hand (or even with only two fingers!), and has no sharp edges, giving it a <strong>perfectly ergonomic shape.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Nova Nation is a basement company that we started 18 months ago.</strong><br/><br/>I have always enjoyed running and hiking, but always found it difficult to carry extra pair of shoes to be able to hike and at the same time run into the water.

<p><strong>This has been an amazing journey for us, and we want to continue this journey with you. We have more ideas in pipeline in which our backers will be the first ones to know.</strong></p>
<p>We are constantly working to find ways to create a life style and community for our customers. One great new tool which is under construction is an application in which every Nova user can sign on and share different hiking, jogging, and swimming locations, so that other users can easily find places to be active on. This to promote active life style and make our follower’s lives easy!</p>
<p><strong>Everyone will be able to share their experience with each other and add new tracks for running, hiking swimming etc</strong></p>
<p><strong>When we told you at the beginning of the campaign that this was a basement company, well it started in Janet's basement.</strong></p>
<p>That was 18 months ago, today we are still part time in Janet's basement and part time testing our Nova shoes. Hence we are still working on adjusting the shoe to perfection! The idea of Nova Nation came from Janet and her love for running and hiking, today she only uses a pair of Nova's for her run no matter what the surface is.</p>
<p>The passion for running and design has lead us to become the creators of potentially the world’s “Ultimate Terrain Shoes”, and with your help we will deliver the best all terrain shoes on the market. We will not stop there as we want to build a community around Nova Nation and we want you to be part of it from day one!</p>

</div><div><h3>Thank you for reading and watching our campaign, we can't wait to deliver your Nova Nation shoes, let's keep moving forward.</h3></div></div>","Nova Nation is a basement company that we started 18 months ago.I have always enjoyed running and hiking, but always found it difficult to carry extra pair of shoes to be able to hike and at the same time run into the water. Therefore, I started to look for alternative shoes that would allow me to use one pair of shoes but in different terrains.
This is where the story of Nova Nation started!

Nova is fully waterproof and you can easily go from running on track and later to dirt then go for a swim in the ocean, using only one pair of shoes.
Only 1 second to tie your shoes 

The magnetic shoelaces are one of the best functionalities of Nova, and the idea is to keep the same perfect fit and strength and not having the regular shoes laces which many times loosens up during a jog which can be disturbing the actual work out.
This is our first stretch goal



The magnetic shoelaces are fully waterproofed so you can run, walk or swim with your Nova shoes in the water.

With Nova, you can skip wearing socks while you train, because we wanted to create a barefoot type of shoe. The mesh material makes this possible and it will eliminate the odor while jogging/swimming sockless.  
Nova is odorless and your feet will not sweet like with normal running shoes! 

There will be no limitations with your NOVA NATION shoe; we wanted to create a pair of shoes that can go from running to jumping, hiking and swimming and at the same time keep a perfect fit for your feet.

We made a super light all terrain shoe that weight's around 3.5 once /  100 grams.The weight depends on your shoe size, we also made four different colors to fit your style. 

The materials are not only very light they are also super flexible; this is to give the bare foot feeling. 
We also added extra soft rubber at the front and the back in order to get the extra grip while you are running. Every detail is important to make the ultimate terrain shoe and we covered every little detail of the shoes for Nova to be up there with the top terrain shoe brands.

This is a shoe made from a simple idea from our home 18 months ago and today we are asking your help to make this to a reality for you and us.

Saltwater? Not a problem! Simply go from running on the beach to the water and get back to the beach again, you can rinse your Nova's after a day at the beach to get the salt off your shoes for your own comfort.

This has been an amazing journey for us, and we want to continue this journey with you. We have more ideas in pipeline in which our backers will be the first ones to know.
We are constantly working to find ways to create a life style and community for our customers. One great new tool which is under construction is an application in which every Nova user can sign on and share different hiking, jogging, and swimming locations, so that other users can easily find places to be active on. This to promote active life style and make our follower’s lives easy!
Everyone will be able to share their experience with each other and add new tracks for running, hiking swimming etc
When we told you at the beginning of the campaign that this was a basement company, well it started in Janet's basement.
That was 18 months ago, today we are still part time in Janet's basement and part time testing our Nova shoes. Hence we are still working on adjusting the shoe to perfection! The idea of Nova Nation came from Janet and her love for running and hiking, today she only uses a pair of Nova's for her run no matter what the surface is.
The passion for running and design has lead us to become the creators of potentially the world’s “Ultimate Terrain Shoes”, and with your help we will deliver the best all terrain shoes on the market. We will not stop there as we want to build a community around Nova Nation and we want you to be part of it from day one!
Sharing is caring, if you like NOVA like we do please share our campaign with your friends and family.

If you have any questions to us please ask us on the comments or send us a private email if you want to know more about Nova Nation.
Send your question to: info@nova-nation.net

Thank you for reading and watching our campaign, we can't wait to deliver your Nova Nation shoes, let's keep moving forward.",30.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""background-color: initial;"">times.up</span></h2>
<p>How often do you find
spoiled food in your fridge and pantry?   times.up
is a smartphone application that provides an automated inventory of food
purchases, notifies the user about upcoming expiration dates, and suggests
recipes for otherwise wasted food. </p>
<p>Existing software and apps allow users to
organize their food purchases and reduce food waste, but require them to
manually input data.<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">  With times.up, customers no longer need to scan or
manually enter purchases one-by-one. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p>Food inventories will reach consumers in 3 ways:</p>
<p>1. <strong>L</strong><strong>oyalty cards</strong> &amp; <strong>memberships</strong>. In this case, the food inventories will be sent directly from the retailer to the user’s phone or e-mail.</p>
<p>2. Scanning <strong>QR codes printed on sales receipts</strong> (the customer does not need to have an online account or a loyalty card). </p>
<p> 3. Taking a picture of the whole receipt. In this case the food purchase list will be recognized by OCR (<strong>Optical Character Recognition</strong>).</p>The expiration dates relayed to users will
be calculated based on the purchase date or on retailer estimates.</div><div style=""text-align: center;"">
<br/><h3>What do we have for now?</h3>
<p>  We currently have a prototype that provides an
inventory of purchased items and an estimated expiration date for each of them.
At the moment, the only functional automated input method is QR code scanning (codes
could be printed on sales receipts). Users can also use the app to ask for
recipe ideas that include items currently in his/her inventory.</p>

<br/>
<h3>What are we going to do with these funds?</h3>
<p>  In the following months we plan to develop a Public database of expiration dates and add crucial features to the app, such as notifications and new data input methods (loyalty cards and OCR). The campaign funds will be used to pay for programming costs involved in the development
of these features.</p>

<h2>times.up</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Quantas vezes você já encontrou comida estragada em sua geladeira ou em seu armário? times.up é um aplicativo de smartphone que fornece um inventário automatizado dos alimentos comprados, notifica o usuário sobre as próximas datas de validade, e sugere receitas para produtos que seriam desperdiçados.</p>
<p>Alguns programas e aplicativos existentes permitem que os usuários organizem suas compras de alimentos e reduzam o desperdício, mas os usuários têm que inserir as informações manualmente. Com times.up, os consumidores não precisam mais scanear ou inserir os produtos um por um.</p>
<p>Os inventários de alimentos comprados chegarão aos consumidores em 3 formas:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>1. <b>Cartões de fidelidade </b>em alguma rede de supermercados. Neste caso, os inventários de alimentos comprados serão enviados diretamente do varejista para o e-mail ou telefone do usuário.</p>
<p>2. Scaneando <b>códigos QR impressos em recibos de compra</b> (o cliente não precisa ter uma conta on-line ou um cartão de fidelidade).</p>
<p> 3. Tirar uma fotografia do recibo por inteiro. Neste caso, a lista de alimentos comprados será reconhecida por <b>OCR (Optical Character Recognition).</b></p>
<p>As datas de vencimento retransmitidas para os usuários serão calculadas com base na data da compra ou em estimativas do supermercado.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>O que temos até agora?</h3>
<p>  Atualmente, temos um protótipo de aplicativo que fornece um inventário de itens comprados e uma data de expiração estimada para cada um deles. No momento, o único método de entrada funcional é por código QR (os códigos serão impressos nos recibos de compra). O usuário também podem usar o aplicativo para pedir ideias de receitas que incluem itens atualmente em seu inventário.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433671179/c4yocewdm4j465z9moxg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><h3>O que vamos fazer com o dinheiro arrecadado?</h3>
<p>  Nos próximos meses, pretendemos desenvolver uma base de dados pública de datas de validade e adicionar recursos cruciais para o aplicativo, como notificações (alertas), doação a outros usuários e novos métodos de entrada de dados (cartões de fidelidade e OCR). Os fundos da campanha serão utilizados para pagar os custos de programação envolvidos no desenvolvimento desses recursos.</p>

times.up
How often do you find
spoiled food in your fridge and pantry?   times.up
is a smartphone application that provides an automated inventory of food
purchases, notifies the user about upcoming expiration dates, and suggests
recipes for otherwise wasted food. 
Existing software and apps allow users to
organize their food purchases and reduce food waste, but require them to
manually input data.  With times.up, customers no longer need to scan or
manually enter purchases one-by-one. 

Food inventories will reach consumers in 3 ways:
1. Loyalty cards & memberships. In this case, the food inventories will be sent directly from the retailer to the user’s phone or e-mail.
2. Scanning QR codes printed on sales receipts (the customer does not need to have an online account or a loyalty card). 
 3. Taking a picture of the whole receipt. In this case the food purchase list will be recognized by OCR (Optical Character Recognition).The expiration dates relayed to users will
be calculated based on the purchase date or on retailer estimates.
What do we have for now?
  We currently have a prototype that provides an
inventory of purchased items and an estimated expiration date for each of them.
At the moment, the only functional automated input method is QR code scanning (codes
could be printed on sales receipts). Users can also use the app to ask for
recipe ideas that include items currently in his/her inventory.



What are we going to do with these funds?
  In the following months we plan to develop a Public database of expiration dates and add crucial features to the app, such as notifications and new data input methods (loyalty cards and OCR). The campaign funds will be used to pay for programming costs involved in the development
of these features.


Perks...
First of all: hugs!

For 15$ or more we will send you Fancy times.up stickers.


     


If you contribute with 30$ or more, we will send you a Fancy t-shirt or a Fancy shopping bag.








For 100$ or more you will have the opportunity to be among the first to obtain and test our app. We will also send you a fancy t-shirt and a fancy shopping bag!

times.up

Quantas vezes você já encontrou comida estragada em sua geladeira ou em seu armário? times.up é um aplicativo de smartphone que fornece um inventário automatizado dos alimentos comprados, notifica o usuário sobre as próximas datas de validade, e sugere receitas para produtos que seriam desperdiçados.
Alguns programas e aplicativos existentes permitem que os usuários organizem suas compras de alimentos e reduzam o desperdício, mas os usuários têm que inserir as informações manualmente. Com times.up, os consumidores não precisam mais scanear ou inserir os produtos um por um.
Os inventários de alimentos comprados chegarão aos consumidores em 3 formas:


1. Cartões de fidelidade em alguma rede de supermercados. Neste caso, os inventários de alimentos comprados serão enviados diretamente do varejista para o e-mail ou telefone do usuário.
2. Scaneando códigos QR impressos em recibos de compra (o cliente não precisa ter uma conta on-line ou um cartão de fidelidade).
 3. Tirar uma fotografia do recibo por inteiro. Neste caso, a lista de alimentos comprados será reconhecida por OCR (Optical Character Recognition).
As datas de vencimento retransmitidas para os usuários serão calculadas com base na data da compra ou em estimativas do supermercado.

O que temos até agora?
  Atualmente, temos um protótipo de aplicativo que fornece um inventário de itens comprados e uma data de expiração estimada para cada um deles. No momento, o único método de entrada funcional é por código QR (os códigos serão impressos nos recibos de compra). O usuário também podem usar o aplicativo para pedir ideias de receitas que incluem itens atualmente em seu inventário.

O que vamos fazer com o dinheiro arrecadado?
  Nos próximos meses, pretendemos desenvolver uma base de dados pública de datas de validade e adicionar recursos cruciais para o aplicativo, como notificações (alertas), doação a outros usuários e novos métodos de entrada de dados (cartões de fidelidade e OCR). Os fundos da campanha serão utilizados para pagar os custos de programação envolvidos no desenvolvimento desses recursos.

Recompensas...

Antes de tudo: abraços!
Por 15 $ ou mais  nós lhe enviaremos adesivos times.up exclusivos.

       
Se você contribuir com 30 $ ou mais, nós lhe enviaremos uma camiseta muito chique ou uma bolsa de compras exclusiva!


Por 100 $ ou mais, você terá a oportunidade de estar entre os primeiros a obter e testar nosso aplicativo. Nós lhe enviaremos também uma camiseta bem chique e uma bolsa pra fazer compras exclusiva!

times.up

Combien de fois avez-vous trouvé de la nourriture périmée dans votre réfrigérateur ou votre armoire? times.up est une application de smartphone qui fournit un inventaire automatisé des achats alimentaires, avertit l'utilisateur sur les dates de péremption à venir, et suggère des recettes pour la nourriture qui serait autrement gaspillée.
Des logiciels et applications existants permettent aux utilisateurs d'organiser leurs achats d'aliments et de réduire le gaspillage alimentaire, mais les utilisateurs doivent saisir les données manuellement. Avec times.up, les consommateurs n'ont plus besoin de scanner ou saisir les achats un par un.
Les listes d'aliments achetés seront transmises aux consommateurs de 3 façons:
1. Cartes de fidélité et abonnements. Dans ce cas, les listes des produits achetés seront envoyés directement depuis le supermarché vers le téléphone ou l'adresse mail de l'utilisateur.
2. Scanner des codes QR imprimés sur les reçus d'achat (le consommateur n'a pas besoin d'avoir un compte en ligne ou d'une carte de fidélité).
 3. Prendre une photo du ticket d'achat dans son ensemble. Dans ce cas, la liste des produits achetés sera reconnue par OCR (Optical Character Recognition).
Les dates de péremption relayés aux utilisateurs seront calculées sur la base de la date d'achat ou sur des estimations du supermarché.


Qu'avons-nous pour l'instant? 

Nous avons actuellement un prototype qui fournit un inventaire des articles achetés et une date de péremption estimée pour chacun d'eux. À l'heure actuelle, la seule méthode de saisie automatisée fonctionnelle est la lecture des codes QR (les codes seront imprimés sur les tickets d'achat). Les utilisateurs peuvent également utiliser l'application pour demander des idées de recettes avec des produits actuellement dans leur inventaire.

 Qu'allons-nous faire avec cet argent? 

  Dans les mois prochains, nous prévoyons de développer une base de données publique de dates de péremption et ajouter des fonctionnalités essentielles à l'application, telles que les notifications (alertes), le don d'aliments à d'autres utilisateurs et des nouvelles méthodes d'entrée de données (cartes de fidélité et OCR). Les fonds de la campagne seront utilisés pour payer les coûts de programmation impliqués dans le développement de ces fonctions.

Contreparties...

Tout d'abord: Câlins!
Pour 15 $ ou plus, nous vous enverrons des autocollants times.up très chics.

       
Si vous contribuez avec 30 $ ou plus, nous vous enverrons un t-shirt très très chic ou sac très stylé pour faire vos courses!


Pour 100 $ ou plus, vous aurez l'opportunité d'être parmi les premiers à obtenir et tester notre appli. Nous vous enverrons aussi un t-shirt et un sac à courses très stylés.

<p><i>Pediatrics is an important profession in our society. Child health is very crucial in the upbringing of our children.

Growing up and studying in a developing country has put me face to face with the serious challenges and disadvantages we have. The under-fives mortality rate in Tanzania is 1 in 20 children, and that figure increases amongst the most vulnerable and those with limited access to medical care. Tanzania is a third world country, we are still developing and we need our children to be brought up in a healthy, caring and conducive environment as they are the pillars of the future. My goal is to be able to treat and manage our children, reach out to those in need, to those unable to seek medical care due to various financial, socio-economic and personal reasons, to educate the parents/care-takers on the importance of their child’s health so as to build a better future for them and enable them to grow up and get the chance to live a healthy, happy life like all the other children out there.

<h2>Coconut Oil <br/>
</h2>
<h4>1 jar = 16oz.</h4>
<p>Zuddha exclusively uses single-origin, old-grove, <b>organic</b>, 100% premium Thai coconuts. Unlike some other brands, we do not use any rancid coconuts, meaning our oil is unrefined, unbleached and non-deodorized. We are redefining <b>virgin</b> coconut oil through our 15-step, small batch, <b>raw-qualified </b>process, which uses centrifugal extraction and a fast-freezing <b>cold-pressed</b> method to avoid the prevailing use of high heat and chemicals. <br/><br/>This technique keeps more beneficial nutrients and fatty acids (MCTs) intact and bioavailable. The effect is a superb experience unlike any you’ve ever tasted in coconut oil. Eaten by the spoonful, you will immediately notice its silky smooth consistency with a very mild coconut aroma and no aftertaste. <b>Pure, simple, unequalled... nirvana!</b> <br/></p>

<h2>Coconut Flower Nectar<br/>
</h2>
<p>Zuddha Coconut Flower Nectar is a <b>sugar and honey alternative</b> that is absolutely delicious. The nectar comes naturally from the inflorescence of coconut palm trees, which is the cluster of flowers which make up the reproductive parts of the tree. The coconut palm trees use the nectar to produce coconuts, but it can also be harvested.</p>
<p>When eaten by the spoonful, it has hints of butterscotch and caramel, which adds a wholesome richness to any recipe. As a totally natural, <b>low-glycemic sweetener</b>, it can replace any liquid sweeteners at a 1:1 ratio.</p>

Zuddha's Story 

Two and a half years ago, co-founder Tyson Adams walked the streets of Bangkok looking for coconut oil.  When he discovered what would later become Zuddha, it was pure bliss: the oil was noticeably different in taste, smell and texture.Back in Seattle several months later, Tyson searched high and low for something like it, but no other oils could hold a candle to the memory of that Bangkok coconut oil. Impassioned by the desire to import it to America, Tyson traveled back to Thailand to visit the farm and factory, and eventually partnered with the Thai family who crafts Zuddha. 


The Blind Taste Test Challenge
WATCH THIS VIDEO! Just kidding, YOU REALLY MUST SEE THIS!



What is it Good For?

Absolutely everything! 








Our Small Batch Process
Our small-batch, raw-qualified processing is a revolutionary technology. Zuddha's oil extraction method is superior to all other coconut oil brands, and you will immediately smell and taste the difference. Get ready for a surprise! 

Score these Rewards 




Coconut Oil 

1 jar = 16oz.
Zuddha exclusively uses single-origin, old-grove, organic, 100% premium Thai coconuts. Unlike some other brands, we do not use any rancid coconuts, meaning our oil is unrefined, unbleached and non-deodorized. We are redefining virgin coconut oil through our 15-step, small batch, raw-qualified process, which uses centrifugal extraction and a fast-freezing cold-pressed method to avoid the prevailing use of high heat and chemicals. This technique keeps more beneficial nutrients and fatty acids (MCTs) intact and bioavailable. The effect is a superb experience unlike any you’ve ever tasted in coconut oil. Eaten by the spoonful, you will immediately notice its silky smooth consistency with a very mild coconut aroma and no aftertaste. Pure, simple, unequalled... nirvana! 



Apron

Your choice of apron color (gray/khaki), logo color (white/green) & pockets or no pockets. Email us if you would like to see the other options! Made in the U.S.A.


Coconut Flower Nectar

Zuddha Coconut Flower Nectar is a sugar and honey alternative that is absolutely delicious. The nectar comes naturally from the inflorescence of coconut palm trees, which is the cluster of flowers which make up the reproductive parts of the tree. The coconut palm trees use the nectar to produce coconuts, but it can also be harvested.
When eaten by the spoonful, it has hints of butterscotch and caramel, which adds a wholesome richness to any recipe. As a totally natural, low-glycemic sweetener, it can replace any liquid sweeteners at a 1:1 ratio.

Sharing is Caring 

We donate 1% to The Ayurvedic Institute (non-profit) who promotes the use of coconut oil for whole body wellness. 

Rave Reviews!

It supports the correct pelvis position in an optimal posture to make your body be with the right position at any time, anywhere.BalanceOn Fit Seat Plus is made of air-cell VETAGEL®. VETAGEL® is 99% antibacterial high elastic special polymer combined with the skin irritation-free oil that is used in beauty products. With its unique features, the cushion is distortion-free and could withstand high temperature up to 158℉. The honeycomb structure of the air-cell VETAGEL® provides the optimum dispersion of pressure applied to the hips and thighs, helping to reduce pressure on the skin and blood vessels.  Uncomfortable bottom = neck, back, and muscle pains Sitting all day is the main culprit, thanks to our sedentary lifestyles and jobs that tie us to a desk or driver’s seat from 9 to 5 (if not longer).  Sitting for too long can have short and long-term effects on your health and body, making this seemingly benign activity potentially deadly. It can tighten the hip flexor and hamstring muscles and stiffen the joints themselves. Plus, the uncomfortable bottom could contribute to lower back pain and knee stiffness, scourges that many people suffer from every day. Gluteal Amnesia, aka “Dead butt syndrome”, is a real thing!! Sitting so long that our butts are literally falling asleep. “Dead butt syndrome,” or gluteal amnesia, is a condition that occurs when your gluteus medius gets inflamed and forgets to function normally. Sitting too long can restrict the blood flow, causing gluteal amnesia, which can lead to hip pain, lower backache and problems with your ankles. We are not magicians, we can not offer you apple bottom but, we can help you to reduce the pain and possible gluteal amnesia with BalanceOn Fit Seat Plus.   Weight is just another word for the force of gravity. If we can't control our weight/gravity and if we can't cut our time sitting down, let's try to fight gravity by dispersing gravity! Now, start Anti-gravity-stress free life with BalanceOn! At home, at work, and even in the car, say goodbye to tired sitting. The high-density and high-elasticity of the double-layers honeycomb structure of the air-cell VETAGEL® provide the optimum dispersion of pressure applied to the hips and thighs, helping to reduce pressure on the skin and blood vessels.  It will be very beneficial for wheelchair-bound patients with paralysis, preventing physical deformities such as scoliosis, bedsores, and also promoting musculoskeletal system stability.   Based on the findings, the vehicle vibration can produce a physiological and psychological effect on humans. Vibration can disturb the stability of attention and increase the drowsiness and mental load and serious physical problems ranging from chronic back pain to nerve damage. The combination increases stress and load on the neck, shoulder, and lower back. Outstanding elasticity of double-layers disperses and absorbs micro-vibration. Ability to absorb continuous vibration by motor vehicle driving. Absorption of vibration will reduce back and leg pain from a long term driving.  Central air-hole gives you pleasant sitting by depressing the pressure on the bottom of the upper body. Maximizing the airflow, allowing you to sit on a temperature-neutral surface. No more sweaty bottom from retained body heat.    Ergonomically designed for correcting body posture. The high elasticity of the VETAGEL® perfectly holds the pelvis and posture in every movement. All edges are rounded and placed under your thighs for keeping an optimal posture to provide pleasant seating. It supports the correct pelvis position in an optimal posture to make your body be with the right position at any time, anywhere. Long-term use of the product won’t affect the elasticity or the resilience of the product. It’s durable and won’t develop a body impression. It could be used at high temperature (up to 158°F) without distortion. The properties of VETAGEL® are 99% antibacterial so, no need to worry about dust mites and germ build-ups. Wash it when you feel the need, wash it again if you spilled something, it’s very simple! Take control of your own long-lasting cushion. Covers Applied NST-1000+ Non-Slip technology on the undercover, BalanceOn Fit Seat Plus prevents the slip and keep a correct posture, being fixed on the chair. BalanceOn Fit Seat Plus will come up with 2 new colors, Navy and Brown. These two colors of the cushion will be a better fit for the car!  Double-layers of honeycomb structures are world patent technology developed by millions of 3D graphic design tests. Hexagonal shapes are for withstanding weight (buckling & compression) of building in architectural engineering. The BalanceOn Fit Seat Plus is made with the high-density and high-elasticity of the double-layers honeycomb structure of the air-cell VETAGEL®. The thickness of the two layers is slightly different. With numerous studies,1.5mm thickness of the top layer of the cell wall provided the most comfortable, smooth sitting for the hip. The bottom layer of the cell wall was made slightly thicker to disperse the absorbed body weight and also for its durability and elasticity.     Approved tests   Thesis Medicine AHFE   The first creation of the BalanceOn Fit Seat was sold in Amazon.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi!  We (Lacey and Kristi) got inspired as owners of a spa to create a line better than what we were able to find.  It's simple.  We want better ingredients and better packaging.  Key items of importance to us include:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Ingredients in a body butter and bath bombs that actually nourish the skin with oils and vitamins</li>
<li>Light scents that take you to a place of relaxation and escape</li>
<li>Minimal packaging with recyclable materials (when possible)</li>
<li>Simple, classic, and pretty packaging.   Add to the aesthetic of your space!</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>Our number one goal is to get the minimum funds to start the body butter order.  We have to order a minimum of 5 gallons of each of the 3 scents.   ALL purchases will help with this even if you don't want to order the body butter.</li>
<li>Number 2 is a bath bomb press which will allow us to make 3 times as many bath bombs in the same amount of time and probably save some of Lacey's sanity.  </li>
<li>Anything beyond these 2 goals will go towards materials to make more product and towards marketing to get our brand out there!  Our first outreach with marketing will target  boutiques, spas and gift shops like our own that have difficulty finding quality products that still sell wholesale and don't have a ridiculously high minimum order.  We want to be part of the small business movement that allows owners to bring in quality options without going bankrupt.  </li>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are a lot of other companies out there creating these types of products.  One of the biggest challenges is to create something that can stand out and be worth it's price.  We've spent almost 3 years owning a spa that is constantly searching for these types of products we have purchased and compared many competitor's brands.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Risk:  High overhead.  Solution:  We make 2/3 of our product in the spa and also sell it there so we have very low overhead.  The other 1/3 will be an initially large purchase which is a risk but we will sell it &amp; use it at the spa and will sell to other businesses.</li>
<li>Challenge:  Getting into wholesale businesses.  Solution:  1-We already did 1 trade show and have several businesses that purchased from us.  2-Indigo Fair-we will enroll in this online store that connects small businesses with wholesalers.  </li>
<li>Challenge:  Keeping up with production and fulfilling orders.  Solution:  streamline production process with bath bomb press and have a financial cushion to pre-make candles so we have a decent inventory and can just ship. </li>

<h3>Hi, My name is Drew and I am trying to get everyone to become part of the Dwattle Revolution!</h3>
<p>Staying hydrated is extremely important for staying healthy and fit, but carrying those rigid plastic water bottles everywhere is a pain, not to mention what these rigid plastic bottles do to our landfills, lakes, streams and wooded areas for our generation and generations to come.</p>
<p>My friends and I figured the easiest way to carry water with us would be in the de-hydrated state but the problem being every time we tried to re-hydrate it, the water would run through our fingers and we were left with nothing to drink and unable to hydrate ourselves.</p>
<p>After a lot of thought we decided that what we needed was a type of container that is earth friendly (reusable) and fun to carry. What we came up with is what we call a de-hydrated water bottle because it lays flat when its empty (de-hydrated) and stands up when its full (hydrated). Much like our bodies when we are hydrated we feel full of energy and standing tall, but when we are de-hydrated we feel weak and flat.</p>
<p>Since <strong><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">D</span></em></strong>e-Hydrated <strong><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Wa</span></em></strong>ter Bo<strong><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">ttle</span></em></strong>, is a lot for us to pronounce properly we decided to simply call it The <strong><em>Dwattle</em></strong>!</p>
<p>This unique product can go every where with you, from camping (replace the ice cubes in your cooler with a frozen Dwattle), biking, jogging or any sport that you can think of as well as the gym just to name a few.</p>
<p>The ""Dwattle"" comes dehydrated, to re-hydrate simply add oxidane or hydrogen hydroxide.</p>
<p>Add <strong><em>what</em></strong>?  You say! Most of usually refer to these two relatively unknown chemicals as water or h2o.</p>
<p>Everyone will love the clever and informative re-hydration instructions printed on every Dwattle bottle.</p>
<p>When de-hydrated (empty) the Dwattle bottle lays flat or roles up, allowing very easy storage and transport, and taking up far less space than do rigid bottles. The Dwattle stands up when hydrated, or you can use the provided carabineer style clip to hang wherever most convenient.</p>
<p>This colorful little re-hydration machine is BPA free, easily cleaned in the top rack of your dishwasher, freezable for keeping everything cold in your cooler without that soggy mess ice cubes can cause. As the ice melts in your Dwattle bottle, you have ice cold, thirst quenching, water without wasting a drop of our precious drinking water.</p>
<p>The Dwattle gives Mother Nature a bit of a break by being reusable over and over and requiring less energy to manufacture than do rigid bottles.</p>
<p>We are now asking everyone who understands the importance of staying hydrated to join our Campaign and help us bring this unique product the rest of the way to market.</p>
<p>After much reserch we finalized our design and started the manufacturing process of the Dwattle. In other words we finally brought the Dwattle to life!!</p>
<p>In order for us to continue we need your help!</p>
<p>Manufacturing is costly and our budget is low, your contributions to our campaign would greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>All contributions will be used for:</p>
<p>Manufacturing of the Dwattle;</p>
<p>Packaging;</p>
<p>Web design and maintenance;</p>
<p>Marketing;</p>
<p>And Legal.</p>

Our goal is to aid men by fixing any facial imperfections they may have in order to achieve that ""refined"" look. To be perfectly clear Refine is NOT an acne treatment product, but a supplement to help improve one's skin. Refine CAN however help you conceal any facial imperfections and blemishes, for a more Refined you, a Better you.</p>

<h1>Why Use Refine?</h1>
<p>It seems to be that now, more than ever, appearance influences our first impression of other people, more than we'd like to admit . Since we inadvertently judge the book by its cover, why not make that cover as appealing as possible? Whether it's for a first date or an important job interview Refine can help you feel more prepared for what ever situation life throws at you.</p>

<p>______________________________________________________</p>
<h1>Why Now?</h1>
<p>At first glance, this may be a strange concept for most men to grasp. Putting on any complexion product is not a typical part of a man's morning routine. But this social faux pas can change just as the use of skinny jeans and earrings; items once considered only for women are now worn and accepted by everyone. With a product that can only improve your appearance why let a simple temporary social standard stop you from grasping the opportunity to look better? Complexion enhancers for the male market are already emerging overseas, but their design choices do not appeal to the male audience. They use all sorts of compactors, mirrors, and brushes that are reminiscent of female makeup. Refine's packaging is of a more discrete nature blending in with toiletries, other skin care products, or the items on your shelf. Just think of Refine as another step in your morning routine. Apply once a day, and you'll have Refine acting as a shield protecting you from all the dirt and grime in the world. </p>

<p>Using Refine is short and simple process.  First, wash your hands and face (remember to pat, not wipe your face dry) then unscrew the case and dab a small amount on your finger tips. Then apply it as if it were any other lotion and rub until the powder is no longer visible on the face. </p>

<p>One of the good things that Refine For Men has already accomplished is overcoming the hurdle of any obscuring challenges.</p>
<p>As a company we have already laid out all of the steps necessary for the smooth production of an innovated product. Some of the risks that our company faces in successfully accomplishing the kickstarter project is mainly the possibility of error that comes with the manufacturing of any product. Any possibility of error at any step within the process of production can delay the completion of our product a few days or even a couple weeks.</p>
<p>We feel that it is important to note to you that the estimated time of completion is based on the the initial $3,000 we plan to raise. Now, if we are able to go beyond expectation in the goal we have set for the funding of our product, manufacturing time for the amount of production could possibly increase. The higher the quantity of production, the more accumulated time we might need to produce the product to the best of its quality. Nonetheless, our product will be successfully completed.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hello, Rachael &amp; Joycelyn here! </p>
<p><a href=""https://afrocenchix.com/pages/about-us"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">We started Afrocenchix after meeting at university</a> as teenagers bonding over shared problems with alopecia, skin irritation and ineffective hair care products. Rachael suffers from eczema and a range of allergies so was particularly fed up with the artificial fragrance filled bottles on the market.</p>
<p>Joycelyn studied Sociology and Rachael, Law, so the last thing we imagined is that we'd start the first afro hair care brand to launch in Whole Foods UK!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522157470/efhnexynte9ed2wce7x6.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>We have over 20 combined years of industry experience. Rachael studied as a postgrad at the Institute of Trichologists and holds an MSc. Joycelyn wrote a thesis on the social and historical impact of attitudes to afro hair on society and particularly black women.</li>
<li>This campaign will allow us to: complete our safe, cruelty-free, natural and effective product range; to supply our overwhelming demand; and to grow our team.</li>
<li>By supporting us you're helping to create a world where the health and beauty needs of black families are met without it being a big deal, a world where ""normal"" no longer means ""white"" and where retail is inclusive.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522309171/w3vcoqgzbbehvonsk9wn.png"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>With £25,000 we will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scale up our manufacturing so you get products faster</li>
<li>Update packaging across the range for better function and aesthetic</li>
<li>Launch Spring, our 100% natural styling butter</li>
<li>Complete research and development and cosmetic testing for Swirl, our silicone-free conditioner </li>
</ul>
<p>Supporters will be first to receive <strong>Spring</strong> &amp; <strong>Swirl </strong>and to try our new subscription service with a few little surprises thrown in.</p>
<p>Perks will be shipped by Autumn 2018: we'll keep you updated so you'll have a precise date as soon as we do.</p>
<h2><strong>The Stars of the Show</strong></h2>
<p>When we started Afrocenchix, products for afro hair just weren't good enough. Partly because the unique properties of our kinky, curly, coily hair were ignored by major brands, leading to shelves full of products that just didn't work.</p>
<p>Two of the hardest things to formulate with cruelty-free natural ingredients are also two of the most in demand products: conditioner and styling products.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522164802/snelkwn5x56ompezjhlx.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We're pleased to announce <strong>Spring</strong>, our 100% natural formula enriched with Mango butter and Avocado oil is trialed, tested, vegan certified and ready to launch! It's perfect for twist outs, braid outs and protective styles. <strong>Spring</strong> provides hold and definition whilst keeping your hair soft and bouncy for days! </p>
<div></div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<div></div>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<p><strong>Swirl</strong>, our silicone free conditioner, is still under development. We're testing new botanical active ingredients and plant extracts that give a similar silky texture to silicones.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522163031/cwn8bcal85sjonhhg4gq.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Artificial ingredients such as silicones are effective in conditioning the hair. The problem is that some silicones are bad for our health and many are damaging to the environment, so most naturals choose to avoid them. We've been trying out new silicon-like materials made from shea butter, these esters work in a similar way to artificial silicones and offer great conditioning properties particularly for afro hair. We're almost there! With your support we aim to launch our <strong>Swirl</strong> trial by the summer.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Our Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will make a huge difference:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are revolutionising the black hair industry. Moving it away from profiting on the insecurities of black women by selling us billions of pounds worth of toxic, ineffective products each year. We're changing the industry into one that truly cares and serves, one bottle at a time.</li>

Hello, Rachael & Joycelyn here! 
We started Afrocenchix after meeting at university as teenagers bonding over shared problems with alopecia, skin irritation and ineffective hair care products. Rachael suffers from eczema and a range of allergies so was particularly fed up with the artificial fragrance filled bottles on the market.
Joycelyn studied Sociology and Rachael, Law, so the last thing we imagined is that we'd start the first afro hair care brand to launch in Whole Foods UK!


We have over 20 combined years of industry experience. Rachael studied as a postgrad at the Institute of Trichologists and holds an MSc. Joycelyn wrote a thesis on the social and historical impact of attitudes to afro hair on society and particularly black women.
This campaign will allow us to: complete our safe, cruelty-free, natural and effective product range; to supply our overwhelming demand; and to grow our team.
By supporting us you're helping to create a world where the health and beauty needs of black families are met without it being a big deal, a world where ""normal"" no longer means ""white"" and where retail is inclusive.



What We Need & What You Get
With £25,000 we will:

Scale up our manufacturing so you get products faster
Update packaging across the range for better function and aesthetic
Launch Spring, our 100% natural styling butter
Complete research and development and cosmetic testing for Swirl, our silicone-free conditioner 

Supporters will be first to receive Spring & Swirl and to try our new subscription service with a few little surprises thrown in.
Perks will be shipped by Autumn 2018: we'll keep you updated so you'll have a precise date as soon as we do.
The Stars of the Show
When we started Afrocenchix, products for afro hair just weren't good enough. Partly because the unique properties of our kinky, curly, coily hair were ignored by major brands, leading to shelves full of products that just didn't work.
Two of the hardest things to formulate with cruelty-free natural ingredients are also two of the most in demand products: conditioner and styling products.

We're pleased to announce Spring, our 100% natural formula enriched with Mango butter and Avocado oil is trialed, tested, vegan certified and ready to launch! It's perfect for twist outs, braid outs and protective styles. Spring provides hold and definition whilst keeping your hair soft and bouncy for days! 

 


 
 

Swirl, our silicone free conditioner, is still under development. We're testing new botanical active ingredients and plant extracts that give a similar silky texture to silicones.

Artificial ingredients such as silicones are effective in conditioning the hair. The problem is that some silicones are bad for our health and many are damaging to the environment, so most naturals choose to avoid them. We've been trying out new silicon-like materials made from shea butter, these esters work in a similar way to artificial silicones and offer great conditioning properties particularly for afro hair. We're almost there! With your support we aim to launch our Swirl trial by the summer.
 


Our Impact
Your contribution will make a huge difference:

We are revolutionising the black hair industry. Moving it away from profiting on the insecurities of black women by selling us billions of pounds worth of toxic, ineffective products each year. We're changing the industry into one that truly cares and serves, one bottle at a time.
We've sold thousands of products to hundreds of people all over the globe, we were the first brand for afro hair to launch in Whole Foods UK (after years of searching by the Beauty Buyer) and in 2018 we were awarded BEST NATURAL HAIR BRAND in the BBFAs.

Afrocenchix has been featured by Buzzfeed, Black Hair Magazine, the BBC, Huff Post, the Voice, London Live,Spell Magazine, the Telegraph & other publications.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, I'm Shawn McClendon.  I am a personal trainer, fitness blogger and podcaster, and the fitness columnist for The Macon Telegraph.  To make it plain, I am a guy who has a passion for seeing people living vibrant, healthy lives while avoiding unnecessary disease.</p>
<p>On Friday, September 7th, my wife and I are putting on an event called <i>My Doctor is NOT Responsible for my Health...I AM</i>, and this event is going to empower everyone who attends to be conscious of the power they have over their own health, and it's going to supply them with resources to do so.  This event is a partner event with the 5th annual Georgia Wellness and Fitness Festival, the largest event of its kind in the southeast.  There are going to be motivational talks, a group fitness workout led by an awesome celebrity guest, raffles, and resources for every attendee to take home to give them a head start on their fitness journeys.</p>
<p>We are launching this campaign to help us cover some of our expenses, and to make this event truly great and memorable.  Your contributions to help us create a great event will be tremendous and will help us do work we feel called to do.</p>
<p>For more details, visit <a href=""https://yourhealthatthecrossroads.com/my-doctor-event/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://yourhealthatthecrossroads.com/my-doctor-event/</a></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>We are raising $10,000</strong> to help us cover event expenses, and we are asking for your contribution of <strong>$30 per person</strong>.  The expenses will include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Venue</li>
<li>Bringing our special guest to Macon</li>
<li>PA System/Sound equipment</li>
<li>Healthy Snacks (for approx. 200 attendees)</li>
<li>T-shirts for every contributing attendee</li>
<li>Goodie bags (for approx. 200 attendees) and raffle prizes</li>
<li>Event advertisements (Online ads, radio ads, flyers, etc.)</li>
<li>Venue decorations</li>
</ul>
<p>For your contribution of at least $30, you will get the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A ticket to the event with priority seating</li>
<li>A <i>My Doctor is NOT Responsible for my Health...I AM</i> t-shirt</li>
<li>An opportunity for a pre-event meet-and-greet with our special celebrity guest (for the first 50 contributors)</li>
</ul>
<p>In the event that we did not reach our goal of $10,000, we would either do our event in a scaled-down fashion with the money we do raise, or we would use it for a future health/fitness community event.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Georgia is among the <a href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-healthiest-and-least-healthy-states-in-the-u-s/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">top 10 unhealthiest states</a> in America, which is unfortunate enough.  What's worse is that our county, Macon-Bibb, is among the <a href=""http://www.cbs46.com/story/31243422/top-25-most-unhealthy-counties-in-georgia"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">top 25 unhealthiest counties</a> in the state.  So, needless to say, we're in very bad shape.</p>
<p>While healthcare is part of the solution, it is by no means the solution to our issues with very high levels of preventable disease occurring among our population.  Doctors cannot decide for us what we will put in our mouths, whether or not we will exercise, or if we get enough sleep or sunlight.  We have to decide these things, and this type of mindset is what we seek to perpetuate through this event.</p>
</div><div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3></div><div>
<p>We understand that some may not be able to contribute financially, but still want to help.  If that is you, here's what you can do to support us:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Share, share SHARE</strong>:  Share this Indiegogo campaign on your social media (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc.), via e-mail, or even through a phone call.  Tell your friends about the event and how they can support a movement</li>
<li>
<strong>Join our 10,000 hills challenge</strong>:  As a part of our campaign, we have challenged ourselves to run 10,000 hill sprints leading up to the event, and we challenge you to do the same.  Find a hill in your community, and commit to walking/sprinting up that hill a certain number of times every week, and post a picture of you doing it on your social media with hashtags #iamresponsibleYHATC and #10000togetherYHATC.  We would greatly appreciate it.</li>

Andrijevic Matovac, who succumbed to the illness before being able to climb it
herself. Help us raise one dollar for each meter of our plight and make the “walk
through the thorn road of cancer treatment” easier for those entire unknown
woman who are too poor to afford to do it themselves!
