<h3>Medusa Waking</h3>
<p><strong>Hello! We're Bad Company Theatre - a bunch of local artists who have come together to put on Medusa Waking, an exciting, original Tasmanian work.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>On May 14th of this year, our production will be opening at the Peacock Theatre in Hobart, Tasmania.<br/> </li>
<li>We've put together an incredible team of emerging and established artists, helmed by the fantastic Natalie Venettacci in her directorial debut.<br/> </li>
<li>Medusa Waking is a magical realist story of a modern girl hiding in her bathroom. Over the course of the play, her world becomes intertwined with the myth of Perseus and Medusa. It's eerie, whimsical, and a little bizarre.<br/> </li>
<li>Medusa herself is iconic, and particularly in the last hundred years she's become incredibly meaningful to the feminist movement. This play gives a modern girl the opportunity to talk to her.<br/> </li>
<li>The story explores how mythology can be rediscovered, reclaimed, and readapted into narratives of healing. It's a story of recovery borne from the recovery of a story.<br/> </li>
<li>We strongly believe the stories of survivors are important to tell. Moreover, they're important to tell in a compassionate, careful and non-exploitative way. Truthfully, part of this work comes from a place of lived experiences that the creative team have survived, so we care very much about telling this story and telling it well.<br/> </li>
<li> If 2020 taught us anything, it was about how desperately we love (and miss) live theatre. We've been working on this show for nearly a year and a half, and we're so, so ready to share it with you all.<br/> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Who we are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Medusa Waking is an original work by local playwright Emma Skalicky, which she developed over two years as part of her Honours degree in playwriting. Emma has been published previously, via Currency Press for <i>ATYP</i>, so you know she can deliver. She's currently training to become a counsellor in an effort to help elevate safety standards in independent arts communities.<br/> </li>
<li>Our director, Natalie Venettacci, has spent the last couple of years studying under several prominent Tasmanian directors. This project will be an opportunity for her to implement the skills she has acquired and extend her own artistic practices. Natalie graduated Actors Centre Australia in 2015 and intends to bring the knowledge she obtained from her studies into the acting space.<br/> </li>
<li>Bad Company Theatre is a not-for-profit independent theatre group that is dedicated to supporting local emerging and established artists, and producing quality theatrical experiences for audiences across Tasmania. We support the incubation of developing projects, as well as experimental and established pieces - and we love it!<br/> </li>
<li>We've hired set, sound and lighting designers who have years of experience in upholding the integrity of a production. Two time Tasmanian Theatre Award winner Matt Skalicky will be composing music. For lighting, Chris McBride, who has designed lighting for festivals across the country, and the wonderful Liv Vermey will be acting as stage manager. Jared Goldsmith, a licensed local carpenter with a rich history within the theatre industry will be building the set.<br/> </li>
<li>As for the rest of the cast and crew, we have a fabulous bunch of newcomers and old hats, all of whom have been giving their all to this project since the end of 2019.<br/> </li>
<li>Email us at<strong> bctheatreco@gmail.com </strong>to find out more!<br/> </li>
</ul>
<p>To summarise: We have a show. We have actors rehearsing and a crew working away. We have a theatre booked. This train is leaving the station, but we need your help making sure it gets to its destination</p>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p><strong>Asking for monetary support is simply never easy, but we've put our heads together and here's where we're at:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bad Company Theatre is asking for $7,000 to help get Medusa Waking onto the stage. We believe this is enough to put on an aesthetically strong show, and afford our artists equitable payment. Money will be directly funnelled towards:<ul>
<li>Theatre hire</li>
<li>Advertising</li>
<li>Set construction</li>
<li>Prop budget</li>
<li>Costume budget</li>
<li>Program printing</li>
<li>Making &amp; shipping rewards</li>
<li>Artist fees</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We want to be completely transparent - some of these things (such as theatre hire) are already being paid for, or will have to be paid for during our fundraising period. However, we are currently paying from our personal bank accounts (as we're sure many of you are experiencing firsthand, Job Seeker is not the most amazing arts resource). In those instances, the funds raised will cover the costs we've already personally sunk into the production.<br/> </li>
<li>In other instances (such as set construction) we simply can't make the show what it needs to be without more funds.<br/> </li>
<li>Our flexible fund goal ensures we can build this production around our available resources.<br/> </li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>What you get</strong></h3>
<p><strong>We really, really want to make it worth everyone's while to support this show, so we've rustled up a bunch of rewards we're excited to show you!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>An A3 print</strong> of our original Medusa artwork, by Emma Skalicky.<ul>
<li>Printed on 180gsm Matte Polyester Film.</li>
<li>Framed or unframed - you get to choose!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Hand printed (risographed) t-shirts</strong> of our Medusa design, printed by Tasmanian artist Leigh Rigozzi at Moonshed Moonah.<ul>
<li>These t-shirts can be made for XS to 4XL, and come in white, yellow or pink t-shirt colours.</li>
<li>Because they are risographed, they are awesome quality and no two are ever quite the same. We recommend giving them an iron when they arrive, and washing in cold water <i>only</i> to protect the ink.</li>
<li>The design itself is printed in teal ink. In Tasmania, teal is the colour of SAAM (Sexual Assault Awareness Month - this April). It felt important to take that into consideration in the making of the shirts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Vinyl cuts</strong> of the Medusa Waking sound design, as composed by Matt Skalicky.<ul>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong>The Practicalities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We're an independent theatre company, and what that means is sometimes our resources are pretty slim (alas!).</li>
<li>So, on a very practical level your support will help us cover theatre hire, set building, props and costuming - all the stuff a growing theatre company needs.</li>
<li>Because this is a magical realist play, atmosphere and spectacle are half the fun! So, the more access we have to funding, the craftier we can get.</li>
<li><p>On a more esoteric level, skills learned from our experience on this production will be passed on through our careers as teachers, workshop hosts, counsellors and local directors. We're keen to give back as much as we can.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><br/><strong>The Cause</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The heart of the project explores trauma, sexual assault and empowerment. As we mentioned earlier, part of this work comes from a place of lived experience, so it's incredibly important to us that our work is done well.</li>
<li>Funding ensures we can properly work in partnership with the Tasmanian Sexual Assault Support Service (SASS) to create a production that is compassionate, safe, and sensitive.</li>
</ul>
<p><br/><strong>Artist Pay</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bad Company Theatre <i>cares</i> about paying our cast and crew. Regardless of funding and costs, we are determined to find a way to achieve this.</li>
<li>We are working with eight local performers and seven local crew members, all of whom are dedicated beyond words.</li>
<li>They each have a unique creative practice that will be extended by this production, but they deserve so much more than that. </li>
<li>Ultimately, your support ensures not only the quality of the production, but also that everyone involved CAN be fairly rewarded for the love, time and energy they have devoted to putting Medusa Waking on the stage.</li>
<li>We'll be approaching this from the profit share angle, so the more funds we can raise the closer we can get to equitable pay for everyone involved.</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>We cannot overstate how much we value the community aspect of this opportunity. Bad Company believes that art cannot exist without a community to celebrate it. The support of you all is everything to us. <br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p><strong>Theatre? In this climate? (Don't worry, we've got it covered).</strong></p>
<p><strong>The big one (COVID-19) </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>While an outbreak might stop our season, our intention is to use whatever funds we have to revive it when it is safe to do so.</li>
<li>We keep up to date with all live performance guidelines, and have a thorough COVID Safety Plan to ensure our cast, crew, and audience are as safe as possible.</li>
<li>(Our producer is a microbiologist. Everything is sterile. EVERYTHING.)<br/> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MONEY MONEY MONEY</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We have a thorough money management plan, to ensure our funds go exactly where they need to go.</li>
<li>This involves:<ul>
<li>A detailed, itemised budget.</li>
<li>A nominated funds manager to keep an eye on things.</li>
<li>An approach that priorities a strong, essential foundation for the show, with space to expand should funds allow us.</li>
<li>A producer that loves excel spreadsheets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, we have a long history of fiscal responsibility while producing theatre. Between our two producers, we have put on approximately 30 community and independent shows across a number of companies.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p><strong>Of course, we completely understand that not everyone can afford to financially support us. If you want to help, here are some other ways you can do so: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Keep an eye on our socials for other fundraising ventures. <u>We'll be having a night at The Finders in April to sell some merch, and will be selling raffle tickets for a hamper of Tassie goodies down the line too.</u>
</li>
<li>Spread the word! Make some noise! It truly is amazing how powerful the grapevine can be.</li>
<li>Use the indiegogo share tools to let your friends and family know about this campaign.</li>
<li>Come and see the show, and tell your mates about it. The greatest thing we can do for our artists is rustle up a profit to share, and warm and supportive audience to cheer them on (that's you!)</li>

Medusa Waking
Hello! We're Bad Company Theatre - a bunch of local artists who have come together to put on Medusa Waking, an exciting, original Tasmanian work.

On May 14th of this year, our production will be opening at the Peacock Theatre in Hobart, Tasmania. 
We've put together an incredible team of emerging and established artists, helmed by the fantastic Natalie Venettacci in her directorial debut. 
Medusa Waking is a magical realist story of a modern girl hiding in her bathroom. Over the course of the play, her world becomes intertwined with the myth of Perseus and Medusa. It's eerie, whimsical, and a little bizarre. 
Medusa herself is iconic, and particularly in the last hundred years she's become incredibly meaningful to the feminist movement. This play gives a modern girl the opportunity to talk to her. 
The story explores how mythology can be rediscovered, reclaimed, and readapted into narratives of healing. It's a story of recovery borne from the recovery of a story. 
We strongly believe the stories of survivors are important to tell. Moreover, they're important to tell in a compassionate, careful and non-exploitative way. Truthfully, part of this work comes from a place of lived experiences that the creative team have survived, so we care very much about telling this story and telling it well.

I consider myself a worker in service of art, and I feel it is an individual’s power and self-knowledge that motivates everything. You cannot take political action or be part of any community and be the change if you are not doing yourself. This show is a testimony of all these changes and experiences as a specific woman in the performing arts.</p><h3><strong>Short Summary</strong></h3><p>My name is Anabella Lenzu and I'm a choreographer originally from Argentina, currently living and working in NYC since 2005.  </p><p>I have 30 years of experience working in Argentina, Chile, Italy and the USA, and I am the Artistic Director of Anabella Lenzu/DanceDrama.</p><h3> </h3><h3><strong>Artist Statement:</strong></h3><p><strong>Art is a political act.</strong></p><p><strong>Dance is discipline and revolt.</strong></p><p><strong>My body is my country.</strong></p><p>I react to my environment and use the body as a receptacle and messenger of the multiple realities that we are immersed in. </p><p>My work reflects my experience as a Latina/European artist living in New York and comes from a deep examination of my motivations as a woman, mother, and immigrant.</p><p>Performance is a conduit for examining cultural identity through form and content, as well as relationships between people and society.</p><p>Sharing my point of view of life with others is my duty and my pleasure.</p><p>As an independent choreographer with a dynamic company, it is a challenging and expensive venture to create work and perform in New York City,</p><p>In order to pursue a high-quality experience for artists and audiences alike, we have set a modest fundraising goal.</p><p>I invite you to participate in this goal and to share in the satisfaction of realizing a significant and meaningful process of exploration and discovery.</p><h3><strong>The Show</strong></h3><p>The night that you stopped acting/ La noche que dejaste de actuar, is a one-woman show which both questions and affirms the reality of being a creator, an artist, and a spectator.

</li></ul></div>","OverviewHelp me get ""The night that you stopped acting/ La noche que dejaste de actuar"" to the stage!Both personally and politically, I endeavor to embrace the moment as a woman, mother, and immigrant. I consider myself a worker in service of art, and I feel it is an individual’s power and self-knowledge that motivates everything. You cannot take political action or be part of any community and be the change if you are not doing yourself. This show is a testimony of all these changes and experiences as a specific woman in the performing arts.Short SummaryMy name is Anabella Lenzu and I'm a choreographer originally from Argentina, currently living and working in NYC since 2005.  I have 30 years of experience working in Argentina, Chile, Italy and the USA, and I am the Artistic Director of Anabella Lenzu/DanceDrama. Artist Statement:Art is a political act.Dance is discipline and revolt.My body is my country.I react to my environment and use the body as a receptacle and messenger of the multiple realities that we are immersed in. My work reflects my experience as a Latina/European artist living in New York and comes from a deep examination of my motivations as a woman, mother, and immigrant.Performance is a conduit for examining cultural identity through form and content, as well as relationships between people and society.Sharing my point of view of life with others is my duty and my pleasure.As an independent choreographer with a dynamic company, it is a challenging and expensive venture to create work and perform in New York City,In order to pursue a high-quality experience for artists and audiences alike, we have set a modest fundraising goal.I invite you to participate in this goal and to share in the satisfaction of realizing a significant and meaningful process of exploration and discovery.The ShowThe night that you stopped acting/ La noche que dejaste de actuar, is a one-woman show which both questions and affirms the reality of being a creator, an artist, and a spectator. It's a reexamination of five key pieces of my repertory as well as an investigation of the very nature of the creative process, asking: ""If a work of dance is created in the here and now, what happens when the here and now changes?

<h3>The piece...</h3>
<p>Soul Perchers is a new play written by Cody Stiglich, which will be produced this summer off-off Broadway as a part of NYTF Summerfest and directed by Stacey Schiller. Cody started writing this piece in 2018 and has been developing it through readings and workshops in the New York area. He was inspired to write this play after reading an article about Don Ritchie, an Australian man living on the edge of a cliff who regularly talks people off the ledge of a “notorious suicide spot”.  This fictional play explores hope, perspective, and the universal dilemma of being human. Despite the generational gap, Matt and Sam seek to understand each other and why they may have ended up here.</p>

<h3><strong> Short Summary</strong></h3>
<p>As the world of Mystwood expands we find that we have outgrown the existing NPC storage. Excitingly, Mystwood chapters also acquired a large number of new props from another larp in Massachusetts that recently ended. While we look forward to using these new items, we are now faced with the challenge of storing them. </p>
<p>The current NPC storage is packed, quite literally, to the rafters which makes organizing our existing costuming, props, and weapons a constant challenge. It also makes us pause any time we considered adding new items to our inventory. Do we have room for it? If it is too big to fit in a tote, could we hang it from the rafters? Will one of the game masters have to store it at their home between events?</p> <h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Our goal is to raise $850 for a new shed and shelving. We would also like to accomplish the following, as stretch goals: dedicated weapon and armor storage, costuming, and weapons for both chapters.The primary goal is for the Mystwood chapters to purchase a new shed to alleviate our current storage struggles and allow us space to grow. We also plan to purchase shelving and organization solutions to ensure that we can easily store and locate items, including dedicated weapon and armor storage. If we aren’t able to reach our full funding goal, all funds raised will be put towards the shed and storage first, followed by costuming, weapons and then additional storage. Any funds raised beyond this expansive list of needs will be allocated to Mystwood Burgundar for future projects. </p>
<p>Additionally, as Mystwood grows, we find the need to diversify our costuming. We are looking to purchase cloaks, hats, as well as costuming for colder weather later in the year. These cold weather items can also be used by Novgorod in it’s games. </p>
<p>Our third priority is general weapons for both chapters. Over the years we have had to retire a number of weapons as they became unsafe. As we grow, we also need more weapons to put in the hands of our loving volunteers.</p> <h3>Our Budget</h3> <p>The shed we would like to purchase is about $500. We will need to have it delivered, which is an additional cost. The first $600 raised will be dedicated to the shed. Beyond the shed, we will need to purchase storage solutions in order to use this shed to its maximum potential. This includes shelving, totes, and filing cabinets. Our next $250 dollars will be dedicated to these storage solutions. If we get beyond our goal we would like to spend $200 for weapon storage constructions, $200 on costuming for colder weather, and $200 for weapons.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Overall, the biggest challenge we face will be the actual task of assembling the new shed and then moving and organizing our props into it. Some of our props are currently in temporary storage at various people’s homes and will need to be transported to site. </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>We will need help constructing the shed, and moving/organizing our costuming. Helping us accomplish these tasks, once our project is funded is another great way to help. </p> <p>Another way to help is by sharing this fundraiser on social media. </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Stretch Goals:</h3>
<p>If we are able to reach these goals additional community wide rewards will become available in game. </p> <p><strong>$1000 </strong>- At this level we will be able to fund additional dedicated weapon and armor storage. <br/><strong>Perk:</strong> Olaf One-Eye the Traveling Merchant Prince of Karelia will expand his mercantile empire into the March of Lucevel. Once per game Olaf will arrive in town allowing players to do their buy/sell in town without needing to journey to NPC. He will also have mundane goods and items for sale.</p> <p><strong>$1200 </strong>- At this level we will be able to purchase cold weather costuming for those late fall and winter games when everyone just wants to huddle around the fire. <br/><strong>Perk</strong>: Olaf One-Eye the Traveling Merchant Prince of Karelia will continue to expand his mercantile offerings. He will now be able to offer goods from distant lands and will actively seek to buy commerce tagged items. </p> <p><strong>$1500 </strong>- At this level we will be able to purchase new weapons to replace our aging items and expand our weapon cache. <br/><strong>Perk</strong>: Olaf One-Eye the Traveling Merchant Prince of Karelia will now offer additional goods for sale and bring with him one rare magical to be sold in a raffle.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Unlocked Hidden Stretch Goals:</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>$2000 - </strong>At this level we will be able to invest in some large monster costumes, such as yeti and Minotaur.  </p>
<p><strong>Perk: </strong>The reclusive Old Baba, rumored to know secrets and stories otherwise lost to time has been seen wandering the woods of late. For the right price, they can be convinced to share their knowledge. </p>

Our goal is to raise $850 for a new shed and shelving. We would also like to accomplish the following, as stretch goals: dedicated weapon and armor storage, costuming, and weapons for both chapters.The primary goal is for the Mystwood chapters to purchase a new shed to alleviate our current storage struggles and allow us space to grow. We also plan to purchase shelving and organization solutions to ensure that we can easily store and locate items, including dedicated weapon and armor storage. If we aren’t able to reach our full funding goal, all funds raised will be put towards the shed and storage first, followed by costuming, weapons and then additional storage. Any funds raised beyond this expansive list of needs will be allocated to Mystwood Burgundar for future projects. 
Additionally, as Mystwood grows, we find the need to diversify our costuming. We are looking to purchase cloaks, hats, as well as costuming for colder weather later in the year. These cold weather items can also be used by Novgorod in it’s games. 
Our third priority is general weapons for both chapters. Over the years we have had to retire a number of weapons as they became unsafe. As we grow, we also need more weapons to put in the hands of our loving volunteers. Our Budget The shed we would like to purchase is about $500. We will need to have it delivered, which is an additional cost. The first $600 raised will be dedicated to the shed. Beyond the shed, we will need to purchase storage solutions in order to use this shed to its maximum potential. This includes shelving, totes, and filing cabinets. Our next $250 dollars will be dedicated to these storage solutions. If we get beyond our goal we would like to spend $200 for weapon storage constructions, $200 on costuming for colder weather, and $200 for weapons.
Risks & Challenges
Overall, the biggest challenge we face will be the actual task of assembling the new shed and then moving and organizing our props into it. Some of our props are currently in temporary storage at various people’s homes and will need to be transported to site. 
Other Ways You Can Help We will need help constructing the shed, and moving/organizing our costuming. Helping us accomplish these tasks, once our project is funded is another great way to help.  Another way to help is by sharing this fundraiser on social media. 
 
Stretch Goals:
If we are able to reach these goals additional community wide rewards will become available in game.  $1000 - At this level we will be able to fund additional dedicated weapon and armor storage. Perk: Olaf One-Eye the Traveling Merchant Prince of Karelia will expand his mercantile empire into the March of Lucevel. Once per game Olaf will arrive in town allowing players to do their buy/sell in town without needing to journey to NPC. He will also have mundane goods and items for sale. $1200 - At this level we will be able to purchase cold weather costuming for those late fall and winter games when everyone just wants to huddle around the fire. Perk: Olaf One-Eye the Traveling Merchant Prince of Karelia will continue to expand his mercantile offerings. He will now be able to offer goods from distant lands and will actively seek to buy commerce tagged items.  $1500 - At this level we will be able to purchase new weapons to replace our aging items and expand our weapon cache. Perk: Olaf One-Eye the Traveling Merchant Prince of Karelia will now offer additional goods for sale and bring with him one rare magical to be sold in a raffle.
 
Unlocked Hidden Stretch Goals:
 
$2000 - At this level we will be able to invest in some large monster costumes, such as yeti and Minotaur.  
Perk: The reclusive Old Baba, rumored to know secrets and stories otherwise lost to time has been seen wandering the woods of late. For the right price, they can be convinced to share their knowledge.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Hey! </h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We're Jo and Aaliyah and we are taking Aaliyah's first full-length play to the Camden Fringe Festival, ready for it's premiere. The play is about black female empowerment and strength, as our lead character Mary runs her family-owned hair salon in Brixton, London. The play looks back to the New Cross fire in 1981, and how generations are still impacted today. </p>
<p>Our show is going to The Cockpit at the Camden Fringe Festival on the 9th and 10th of August 2021, and we need to fundraise to help us pay for the venue, the set, and to help us to pay our very deserving, talented cast and crew. This script has been researched and developed for two years, and it's time to take it to the stage for audiences to see! </p>
<p>Representation, diversity, and organic narratives are at the heart of this production; It's an all black/mixed race cast of women, and our core production team are also black and mixed-race women. How often do you see that? We deserve a place on that stage, and we would love if you could help us make that dream come true! </p>
<p>We are aiming to reach £3,000. If we don't manage to get to this, we will use what we have fundraised to go towards the above aspects, and we will attempt to fund the rest ourselves. The dream will not stop here. We have perks set up in return for your donations! (Or you can just choose to donate without a perk attached). </p>
<p>Even a £1 donation helps us get to our goal. If you cannot donate, sharing the campaign will still help us,  because someone else may be able to! Don't worry, we understand struggling artists/students... we are those ourselves! </p>

<h3>What Are We Doing?</h3>
<p>Over the past year and a half, Home Theatre Productions has been working closely with three emerging Canadian playwrights to develop their scripts. The playwrights and our dramaturgs have put countless hours into advancing the scripts, and now it is time for us to move into the next phase of development... It's time to bring these plays to the public! Home Theatre Productions will be presenting a reading of each play in order for the playwrights to receive feedback from both directors and an audience. The date and venue of this reading will be confirmed in the upcoming weeks! Read more about the plays below. </p>
<p> “Potion Ethics” by Emily Stuchbery, is a comedy focused on themes of sexual consent in an intergenerational context. The play follows a family of witches during a time of heightened tension in the witch community. As the local witches' coven debates the ethics of selling love potions, the witches must decide for themselves what they value as a family, and what the concept of sexual and romantic “consent” really entails.</p>
<p>“Grow Up” by Paul Drotos, is a far more tragic story. The play follows a group of teens as they hide in a bunker from the outside world. The “outside world” is filled with adults who turn into zombies as they come of age. The play works within post-apocalyptic story tropes in many ways to encourage the audience to question what the concept of “life” really means.</p>
<p>“Four Aloof Sleuths” by Vitta Morales, is a detective story set in Montreal in the 1990s. Within the bounds of this genre, it tackles issues such as police corruption, the concept of justice, and asks the audience to question preconceived notions of what living in a ""developed nation"" like Canada really means.</p>

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Presenting a reading is expensive! Read more about what we need funds for below.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>A venue for the reading. </strong>As theatres begin to open in Montreal, we are so excited to be able to host a live, in-person reading. However, due to COVID-19 seating capacity, we are looking into a larger venue than would usually be necessary. We want to bring these plays to as much of the public as we can, while keeping our cast, crew and audience safe. </li>
<li>
<strong>Payment for actors. </strong>Actors work hard, and they deserve to be paid appropriately! For the three plays we will be hiring ten actors, several of whom will work on multiple plays. </li>
<li>
<strong>Payment for the stage manager and other technicians. </strong>The people who work behind the scenes are just as important as those who are visible, and they deserve to be paid as such. </li>
<li>
<strong>Payment for directors. </strong>One of the most valuable aspects of hosting a reading is having professional directors who can give our playwrights more feedback on their scripts. However, this means we need money to pay them!</li>

<h3>The Playwrights</h3>
<p>Curious about who our playwrights are? Read more below!</p>
<p>Carlos (Vitta) Morales is a Montreal based musician and playwright. Originally from Fredericton, New Brunswick, Vitta moved to Montreal to attend the Schulich School of Music where he graduated with a concentration in jazz drumming. During his studies, Vitta started to develop an affinity for theatre and would go on to write his most notable play to date: Brunch! The Musical. This original musical comedy was staged twice in 2018, having participated in the Mcgill Drama Festival and Halifax Fringe Festival; the performances were described as “vibrant” by the Mcgill Tribune, and “fun and energized” by The Coast. Vitta tries to incorporate his drumming into his plays by making a point to showcase the more “musical” side of dialogue; always striving to be conscious of its rhythmic aspects. Vitta continues to develop and workshop new scripts but outside of playwriting, much of his time is spent bandleading and writing for the surf rock band King Lobster Krew, and working as a music rights administration consultant for various clients.</p>
<p>Emily Stuchbery is originally from B.C. and has spent the last four years pursuing a Cultural Studies degree at McGill University. A lover of fiction in all its forms, she owes her love of theatre in particular to her fourth-grade production of Charlotte’s Web. Since then she has worked on both the technical and creative sides of numerous productions throughout high school and university (some highlights include: Spring Awakening, The Wizard of Oz, and Jack and the Beanstalk: A Christmas Pantomime). Potion Ethics is the first play she has successfully completed as a solo playwright. In the past she has worked collaboratively on an original production entitled Grimm is the New Black (Penticton Secondary School 2015), as well as on some original comedy sketches, short films, and of course some non-sensical plays she wrote with her brothers as a child on family vacations. She is the author of many poems and unfinished novels that very few people have seen and is beyond grateful for the opportunity Home Theatre has provided for her to grow as a writer and to share some of her work with a wider audience.</p>
<p>Paul Drotos is a 24-year-old Canadian improviser by trade that was told by his drama teacher not to pursue improv. He wrote ""Grow Up"" after being told that without a background in proper drama or writing, it would be hard for him to successfully write a play. Paul is, incidentally, terrible at listening to people.</p>

<p>The Miss Karla's Side documentary is essentially passion project from the Director of this film, Tessa. It's a documentary surrounding a very small dance school in Melbourne, on the Mornington Peninsula and by extension, surrounding the teacher. As someone who started with this school when I was three, and are now more than half way through the 20th year, I want to explore the culture of the school, and foster that emotional connection with audience that I have with the school - as together we imagine and explore what the future will be following Karla's retirement, and in a Post-Covid world.</p>
<p>Miss Karla's Side will document the legacy of a dance teacher, and her dance school, post her retirement. The emotional documentary will give a window into the past; introduce where Karla's journey first began as a dancer, and the establishment of her school. The past then flows into the present and the future, where the current climate has left the school, and after her retirement, questioning what sort of legacy she will be leaving behind for her students, the parents, and the future principals of her school.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Travel: </strong>With two days of driving around for interviews, the travel cost we need to account for is one car for the 5 person crew to be traveling from home and then around to each interview.</p>

Composer: As music is such an important aspect of dance, it was important that we find music that is more than just royalty free/generic. Our composer, Daniel Lee - is an Australian Musician and Sound Producer that has been contracted to provide music for the full 8-9 minute documentary.
Travel: With two days of driving around for interviews, the travel cost we need to account for is one car for the 5 person crew to be traveling from home and then around to each interview.
Misc: These miscellaneous fees are accounted into the budget in order to allow for the crowdfunding platform fee and and rounding the budget up to have that wiggle room in case there are last minute charges we need to account for.
Essentially, this project will have to have enough to cater for the crew and dancers, and to pay for studio hire for that one specific day within the 4 day shoot ($70 Catering for 1 day, $175 Studio Hire for 1 day).

<h2>The Show</h2>
<p><strong>I investigate the interior logic of performance and the role of a dancer in our culture today, redefining the parameters of dance and theater.</strong></p>
<p>I have arrived at a moment where I am 41 years old, have two kids, notice my body aging, and reflecting on other changes psychologically and emotionally. This new show is about recognition, and reframing myself one more time.</p>
<p>Over the years, I have found out things about myself in terms of how and to whom I give: as a mom I give to my kids, I give to my students, I give to my company members. Now I am giving myself attention and care (as well as some challenges), something I have not done for a long time.</p>
<p>I feel that this show is a testimony to all these changes and experiences as a specific woman in the performing arts. One concept I've had to re-evaluate is the idea of what a dancer needs to look like, because there is a certain expectation of physical beauty in the world of trained ballerinas. In this new work, I examine my wrinkles, my boobs and belly as if it was an inspection. My body is a testimony to all the changes in my life and it shows the passage of time, leaving a map of my experiences.</p>
<p><strong>I am interested in two things; the body as a container and the body as a tool.</strong><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1502396749/aorzoyyosa43wswamulv.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/></p>

The Show
I investigate the interior logic of performance and the role of a dancer in our culture today, redefining the parameters of dance and theater.
I have arrived at a moment where I am 41 years old, have two kids, notice my body aging, and reflecting on other changes psychologically and emotionally. This new show is about recognition, and reframing myself one more time.
Over the years, I have found out things about myself in terms of how and to whom I give: as a mom I give to my kids, I give to my students, I give to my company members. Now I am giving myself attention and care (as well as some challenges), something I have not done for a long time.
I feel that this show is a testimony to all these changes and experiences as a specific woman in the performing arts. One concept I've had to re-evaluate is the idea of what a dancer needs to look like, because there is a certain expectation of physical beauty in the world of trained ballerinas. In this new work, I examine my wrinkles, my boobs and belly as if it was an inspection. My body is a testimony to all the changes in my life and it shows the passage of time, leaving a map of my experiences.
I am interested in two things; the body as a container and the body as a tool.
I use two live-streaming cameras, two projectors and two laptops. One camera is above and one below. I view technology in this piece as if it were a magnifying glass, showing something normally hidden from normal view.
The cameras become a portal to another dimension (especially close up), that you can’t see in a regular live performance in such detail. Seeing the performance live, from close up and from far away with different angles adds depth and new possibilities of engagement.  
 The camera frames the dancer (myself) with another intention, another point of view in how it captures life and movement. I can offer the audience 3 different readings of myself. The audience member decides what point of view to see and when.
I love to work and collaborate in an atmosphere of creativity, respect, responsibility, honesty, independence and freedom.

From a passion for making their own work, a desire to create something with a message that matters, and a dream of performing at the Edinburgh Fringe, Fandango was born. Using a shared interest in sexual politics, their own life experiences, and stories of people they've met, they created the story for <i>Partial Nudity</i>. </p>
<p><br/></p>

<h3>What is Partial Nudity about?</h3>
<p>A Bolton pub. One stag do. One hen do. Two strippers forced to share a makeshift dressing room. For Darren, a local lad, this will be his first full strip. For Nina, an international student at Manchester, it’s just another stag to pay off her student loans. Over the course of this claustrophobic 50-minute drama, these two strangers descend into a territory that leaves the audience feeling as exposed as they are. An intense exploration of gender roles and power.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Noga Yechieli and I am the writer/director of <i>Let's Talk Sex Work: A Play</i>.  <br/><i>LTSW</i> is an interactive theatrical piece exploring the daily lives of cisgender and transgender women in sex work. The piece is based on true stories and experiences shared with me as a counselor working with sex workers in Tel Aviv, and transcribed testimonies of sex workers from Israel and the United States taken from literature. During my work and research I found that the public discourse about sex workers usually pathologized or romanticized them. As a counselor, I kept wishing more people could hear the incredible stories that were shared with me.</p>
<p>This piece intends to challenge Hollywood stereotypes by presenting a more complex understanding of this industry. We need to hear these stories and learn about the ways in which they are connected to our own struggles around race, gender, class, sexuality and identity, and take responsibility for sex work and the social conditions that produce it. To learn more about us, check out our <a href=""http://letstalksexwork.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a>.</p>
<p>We have been working on <i>LTSW </i> for two years, and in the current political climate it feels more important than ever to reach a greater audience. We have partnered with the LGBT Center in LA, and they are interested in hosting performances for their community, but have limited funding. We are raising money to support this production, so that we can share these stories that are often silenced. </p>
<p><strong>Our incredible cast includes: Camila Ascencio, Morgan Danielle Camper, Lucinda Jenkins, Miranda Kahn, Tyree Marshall, Henita Telo, Claudia Wit, Lucia Xu</strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal is $2000.</p>
<p>Our production does not require a set and is very easy to tour. Our only expenses are:</p>
<p>1. Transportation for the artists to the venues. </p>
<p>2. compensating the artists for their time and energy.  You will be helping artists that have given their heart and soul to this piece, and have served as actors and educators throughout this process.</p>
<p>If we achieve our goal, we will have 4 full performances funded!  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Perks</h3>
<p>We have some cool perks depending on the size of your donation! If you donate $100 or more your name will be listed on our website as one of our official sponsors. </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The tickets to <i>LTSW  </i>are free. We believe that everyone should have access to see this piece and learn about the sex work industry. Your donation will keep us from having to charge our potential audience. </p>
<p>Our 8 performances of <i>LTSW  </i>last spring were all sold out, and the responses have been moving and powerful. Audience members have reached out expressing gratitude for feeling represented, or offering assistance in promoting the piece. The Q&amp;As at the end of our performances were fruitful and prompted discussions regarding the sex work industry and our responsibility as a society.  We are proud to provide a space for these important conversations.</p>

<h2><strong>Our journey...</strong></h2>
<p>For the past three years, we’ve been bringing our <strong>LOVE STORY FOR THE AGES</strong> to audiences throughout the New York/New Jersey area. We’ve played in all kinds of theatres (NYC’s Cutting Room, the Historic Strand) to all kinds of people, including celebrities like <strong>Federico Castellucccio </strong><i>(Furio from</i><strong><i> THE SOPRANOS</i></strong><i>)</i>, <strong>Eddie and Dave Brigati</strong> of <strong>The Rascals</strong>, <strong>Legendary DJ Cousin Brucie</strong>, actor <strong>Joe Morton</strong> - even <strong>LOU CHRISTIE </strong>himself! Written and directed by <strong>George Cameron Grant</strong> and starring <strong>Vince Bandille</strong>, <strong>3 EGG CREAMS - A RHAPSODY IN THE RAIN</strong> is the life-spanning and life-affirming urban tale of <i>Vin Morrone</i> and <i>Angela Rose Bernstein</i>. In a <strong>Master Class</strong> in acting, <strong>Mr. Bandille</strong> portrays all seven characters in the story, interwoven by a soundtrack of <strong>LOU CHRISTIE</strong> classics, including <i>Lightning Strikes, The Gypsy Cried, Two Faces Have I</i>, and of course, <i>Rhapsody in the Rain</i>, most playing over the iconic centerpiece of the show, the historic <strong>ROCK-OLA RHAPSODY 160 JUKEBOX</strong><i>, which Vin Morrone</i> himself introduces in this scene from <strong>3 EGG CREAMS</strong>...<strong>   </strong></p>

<h2><strong>What we need...</strong></h2>
<p><strong>LOU CHRISTIE</strong>’s timeless music, and this amazing jukebox it’s played on, play a huge part in Vin’s life - and in our show. The music’s kind of a soundtrack - and the jukebox? It’s an iconic piece of music history. We lucked out and found a genuine <strong>ROCK-OLA RHAPSODY 160 JUKEBOX</strong> in excellent condition, then tricked it out with <strong>Lou's </strong>45 covers to use in our performances. But this isn't just a machine, it's a sacred symbol of our musical memories. Check out how beautiful this baby is...</p>

<p>But we <strong>ALSO</strong> found out real quick that traveling is <i>brutal </i>on 350lb historic jukeboxes, not to mention shipping budgets, so we made the decision to preserve the integrity of this classic jukebox by <strong>RETIRING</strong> and <strong>RESTORING</strong> our genuine <strong>Rock-Ola Rhapsody 160</strong>, while having a fully lit, actual size <strong>REPLICA</strong> expertly constructed by the stage prop artisans at <strong>Stone Dog Studios</strong> of Freehold, NJ. This replica will become a permanent part of all our future live shows, while our <strong>RESTORED</strong> <strong>Rhapsody 160</strong> will be saved for a <strong>planned filming of the live show</strong> by <strong>Award-Winning Filmmaker</strong> <strong>Anton Evangelista. </strong>This film will be streamed to all those prevented from experiencing the live show due to the present and post Covid-19 reality. The creation of this replica is crucial to the future of <strong>3 EGG CREAMS</strong>, so that when theatre is once again ready to <strong>ROCK</strong>, we'll be ready to <strong>ROLL</strong>, and that's why we're reaching out to <strong>YOU!</strong> Help us <strong>PREPARE FOR THE FUTURE </strong>while also helping us<strong> PRESERVE THE PAST, </strong>by contributing to this campaign. <strong>ALL</strong> funds we receive in excess of our <strong>$5500</strong> <strong>REPLICA CREATION GOAL</strong> will be used to fully restore our <strong>ROCK-OLA RHAPSODY 160 </strong>to its pristine, operational condition. All funds beyond that will help fund the <strong>FILMING of the LIVE SHOW</strong>.<strong> </strong>As a <strong>THANK YOU</strong>, we're offering several exciting <strong>REWARDS</strong> at various pledge levels, including one where you actually become part of the finished <strong>ROCK-OLA RHAPSODY 160 Replica! </strong>At <i>whatever</i> pledge level you choose to participate, you become a permanent part of the <strong>3 EGG CREAMS - A RHAPSODY IN THE RAIN </strong>family, and your name will be added to our ""<strong>KEEP OUR MUSIC PLAYING"" Contributor List</strong> that will be prominently added to our <strong>Official 3 Egg Creams Website</strong> (<strong>3EggCreams.com</strong>), featured in programs of all our future live shows, and in the credits of the filmed version of the live show when it's completed.

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>""Children spend every second of every day in a moment that adults get maybe 10 seconds of...I want to spend the rest of my life in those 10 seconds. I want to take off all of my clothes, lay down in the grass of that space, and then stay there. Forever.""</i></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">About <i>10 SECONDS</i>
</h2>
<p><strong>In 10 Seconds, the language of connection is brought to life by five moving bodies, encapsulating the universality of love: love of other, love of thing, love of higher power, love of love, and most importantly, love of self. In this poetry and movement play, the human psyche unlocks into a funhouse – a true world of abandon. Here, words are no longer pedestrian speech, but lyrical expressions of emotion; and behavior transforms into a movement analysis of our most private moments.</strong></p>
<p>10 Seconds began as a collection of spoken-word poetry. We sat down together one afternoon to discuss the idea of bringing movement and dance to one of the poems, and quickly realized that this was more than just quick collaboration. This was a show. This could be a theater experience that has never been realized before. Something truly new. Flash-forward to almost a year later: after multiple readings, edits, additions, hours in coffee shops, and late night conversations, the script is complete. We are ready to bring 10 Seconds to life... </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">WHO WE ARE</h3>
<p>Bloom Theatre Company is a transformative, contemporary theater company founded by Mackian Bauman and Danielle Bonanno. Bloom Theatre Company crosses boundaries in their choice of medium combining dance, spoken word, music, and visual art in order to redefine what the “theatre experience” means. They engage audiences by connecting with all human senses, creating highly textured worlds. By combining these elements, Bloom Theatre Company reaches into the souls of their viewers to draw out the things that unify us as a community, reminding us all that despite intrapersonal differences, we all exist under the collective of humanity together.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">OUR GOAL</h3>
<p>Art is exciting. It wakes the soul and the mind and asks them to sit down and have a chat. But art is also expensive. Art in New York City is expensive and we need your help to bring 10 Seconds to life. </p>
<p>We need to raise $5,000 for this workshop:</p>
<p>This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rehearsal Space</li>
<li>Performance Space</li>
<li>Sound Equipment </li>
<li>Lights</li>
<li>Set</li>

About 10 SECONDS

In 10 Seconds, the language of connection is brought to life by five moving bodies, encapsulating the universality of love: love of other, love of thing, love of higher power, love of love, and most importantly, love of self. In this poetry and movement play, the human psyche unlocks into a funhouse – a true world of abandon. Here, words are no longer pedestrian speech, but lyrical expressions of emotion; and behavior transforms into a movement analysis of our most private moments.
10 Seconds began as a collection of spoken-word poetry. We sat down together one afternoon to discuss the idea of bringing movement and dance to one of the poems, and quickly realized that this was more than just quick collaboration. This was a show. This could be a theater experience that has never been realized before. Something truly new. Flash-forward to almost a year later: after multiple readings, edits, additions, hours in coffee shops, and late night conversations, the script is complete. We are ready to bring 10 Seconds to life... 
WHO WE ARE
Bloom Theatre Company is a transformative, contemporary theater company founded by Mackian Bauman and Danielle Bonanno. Bloom Theatre Company crosses boundaries in their choice of medium combining dance, spoken word, music, and visual art in order to redefine what the “theatre experience” means. They engage audiences by connecting with all human senses, creating highly textured worlds. By combining these elements, Bloom Theatre Company reaches into the souls of their viewers to draw out the things that unify us as a community, reminding us all that despite intrapersonal differences, we all exist under the collective of humanity together.
OUR GOAL
Art is exciting. It wakes the soul and the mind and asks them to sit down and have a chat. But art is also expensive. Art in New York City is expensive and we need your help to bring 10 Seconds to life. 
We need to raise $5,000 for this workshop:
This includes:

Rehearsal Space
Performance Space
Sound Equipment 
Lights
Set
Props & Costumes 
Compensating Actors
Compensating Designers & Our Stage Manager
Media (Videography & Photography) 
And of course, the things that we hope don't come up, but might! 

Other Ways You Can Help
Please feel free to share our campaign with friends, family, and on social media! We appreciate all forms of support!

<p>We are a new production project who promote the best up and coming talent in the country. Not only do we support the development of shows but also put on comedy variety nights across London, supporting acts of all different genres.</p>
<p>As working comedians in the industry we were frustrated with only certain types of people and genres being represented at events we performed at, and that the treatment of a lot of acts wasn't fair, so we decided to do something about it... that is how Hot Air Baboon was created!</p>
<p> We have a few principals that we adhere to with the projects/events we work on: </p>
<p>We aim to promote diversity, working with female, BAME and LGBTQ+ artists, and artists of all ages and economic background. We work to always create a safe space for acts to present their talent, and for our audiences to enjoy the show. We pay our acts, part of the proceeds of our nights go back to our hard working performers. We also create a relationship to help develop the artists who work with us creatively, and support them when we can. We love variety, most comedy nights are over-saturated with stand-up, and the few variety acts feel out of place, but comedy can be so much more. We  work with performers that do stand-up, sketch comedy, character comedy, musical comedy, cabaret, clowning, drag, improv, etc. We support our artists on all their ventures and work hard on building lasting relationships with them and the venues we work with.</p>
<p>Although we are small we are working hard to try and change the comedy industry for the better, helping those talented people who often get overlooked. </p>

<h3>Artcoholic</h3>

<p>Artcoholic is a comedy cabaret about wanting to make it in an industry that doesn't want you. The show focused around Muchachico, a Spanish artist whose only desire is to go down in history as the greatest artist of his generation, and the many obstacles he faces, from the arbitrary nature of the art industry to his own lack of real talent.</p>
<p>The story will resonate with a wide demographic, because we are all collectively experiencing a world where opportunities are lacking, and it is harder to achieve one's personal goals, being buying a house, progressing at work, or making it in a creative industry.</p>
<p>Artcoholic is part of a underrepresented form of entertainment because it is a drag king show. While queer shows and drag queen shows are on the rise at the fringe, there are still very few drag king shows. Many theatre goers don’t know that drag kings exist. This is an opportunity to promote a form of entertainment that have not reached the mainstream. </p>
<p>Mos importantly, Artcoholic is a funny and enjoyable comedy that anyone would enjoy. The most daring element of this show is live painting, which will be used to create a very dynamic and visually pleasing comedy experience.</p>
<p>Don't miss this comedy about gender, self-awareness and bad art.</p>

<p>Witty Gritty Bitty Fitty Committee is an hour of fast paced sketches using a multitude of different forms including musical, character and physical comedy. Our writing is dark, camp and with satirical undertones. What makes this show unique is its metamorphic style, which will keep the audience captivated and on the edge of their seats.</p>
<p>We are proud queer performers that embrace the weird and subversive, and we believe that this show will appeal to the LGBTQ+ community. We are also creating a show that is very visually striking and a big spectacle, our aim is to attract new audiences of theatre-goers and show them the brilliance of daring sketch comedy. The show will also attract comedy lovers, by using a multitude of different comedy genres, it will certainly bode well with the fringe veterans.</p>

<h3>I Can't do this</h3>

<p> </p>
<p>I CAN’T DO THIS is the debut solo show from Lewis Goody that explores the anxious mind, the burden of its effects; and how it can transform a confident, young weirdo to a reluctant wastrel who is scared of everything. On stage, armed with a plastic baby, a cardboard box and a loop pedal, Lewis will attempt to do battle with the voices that keep him fulfilling his destiny…or maybe not.</p>
<p>Lewis uses his arsenal of talents: rapping, looping, singing, puppetry the list goes on... to confront the beast that is our fear of failure.</p>

<h3>Séayoncé</h3>

<p>Séayoncé is a drag cabaret extravaganza for all those people who are afraid of death, because they feel like they aren't truly living their lives.</p>
<p>It is set in a seance because what better place to talk about your fear of death then surrounded by the dead.  Our main conduit to the spirit world is the eccentric, cosmic joke clairvoyant Séayoncé, who will use the spirits to find out your deepest darkest fears and help you overcome them.  </p>
<p>This show uses a plethora of different genres to portray its message from song, dance, puppetry, poetry etc. There is a lot of character comedy as she allows ghosts to take over her human form, portraying spirits from all walks of life to help you live yours.</p>
<p>It is a powerful Queer show highlighting, the negativity we allow ourselves to be dominated by, from our obsessions with death, our addictions to self sabotage to our endeavors to find love and not be lonely. </p>

<h3>What the Baboons need help with...</h3>
<p>Edinburgh Fringe festival is an incredible platform for up and coming artists to showcase their work in front of the public and members of the industry, and can be career changing. Unfortunately it is also a very expensive one which has a lot of risks for the artists taking up shows.</p>
<p>So far we have managed to financially support the shows through past variety nights we have housed, and fundraisers and also just working extra jobs to try and afford what we can. But we need your help to achieve that final push to get us to this amazing festival, and smash this opportunity!</p>
<p>We have sat down and worked out that we still need to<strong> raise £3000</strong> that will be spread between the different shows, so that we are able to perform these exciting projects. </p>
<p>This is what this money covers...</p>
<p><u><strong>Printing:</strong></u>  When we are at the festival the way we will be promoting our shows is with posters and flyers that we will giving to the public on a daily basis for the whole month...That is a lot of flyers! We have calculated that the printing costs alone for this, for all of our shows will cost <strong>£600</strong></p>
<p><u><strong>Transport:</strong></u> Just getting to the tropical land that is Edinburgh costs a pretty penny. We have calculated that for us all to be able to get a train up to Scotland and then to travel back on the elation of a successful fringe will cost <strong>£450</strong> </p>
<p><strong><u>Apartment: </u></strong>  We have managed to pay the first few installments for our apartment in Edinburgh, but we need your help to cover the last part. The cost of preventing us from being homeless during the whole month of the festival is<strong> £750</strong> </p>
<p><strong><u>Costume/Set:</u></strong> To help make our shows the fabulous creations we have envisioned we need fabulous costumes and set. This will help bring the shows to the next professional level and really stand out from the competition at fringe. For us to create that certain je ne sais quoi we need  <strong>£600</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Living costs:</u></strong> When we are at the festival we do not get the profits from our ticket sales until after the fringe, which means we technically wont be working for a month! We need help with just day to day living costs e.g. food. To keep us comedians from starving, and allowing us the comfort to just focus on our projects and not be working on the side we have figured out we need  <strong>£600</strong></p>
<p>As you can see the areas your generous donations will be aiding are all necessities for us to be able to take our projects up to the festival this year, so please help us...go on I dare ya.</p>

<p>We want to show how much we appreciate all the help you give to us by giving back to you in anyway we can!</p>
<p>Depending on how much you are willing to help us out with, you can be the lucky receiver of a variety of different rewards, don't believe me? Here are some examples...</p>

Costume/Set: To help make our shows the fabulous creations we have envisioned we need fabulous costumes and set. This will help bring the shows to the next professional level and really stand out from the competition at fringe. For us to create that certain je ne sais quoi we need  £600
Living costs: When we are at the festival we do not get the profits from our ticket sales until after the fringe, which means we technically wont be working for a month! We need help with just day to day living costs e.g. food. To keep us comedians from starving, and allowing us the comfort to just focus on our projects and not be working on the side we have figured out we need  £600
As you can see the areas your generous donations will be aiding are all necessities for us to be able to take our projects up to the festival this year, so please help us...go on I dare ya.
 

 
Cheeky Perks
But do not fear your generous donations wont be unrewarded, there are perks...that's right perks!
We want to show how much we appreciate all the help you give to us by giving back to you in anyway we can!
Depending on how much you are willing to help us out with, you can be the lucky receiver of a variety of different rewards, don't believe me? Here are some examples...
A heart felt thank you, a personalised joke, a personalised song, a filmed sketch, a painting of you, copies of our posters, free tickets to one of variety shows in London, free tickets to our shows in Edinburgh, a cabaret night we host in your honour, and more!!!

World View Productions was founded in 2008 as an innovative company that values diversity in a multicultural society.  Our mission is to create a cultural bridge between New York and international artists (particularly Latin American artists) through high quality theater and film in Spanish and English.  After an outstanding success and enthusiastic welcome from audiences and critics of our first theatre production, Cayendo con Victoriano, we are thrilled to produce our second show, Muerte Súbita (Sudden Death) by Mexico's leading playwright Sabina Berman.
 
THE PLAYWRIGHT
Sabina Berman is an award-winning Jewish Mexican playwright, essayist, poet, writer, film and theater director.  Her best known plays include the critically acclaimed Between Pancho Villa and a Naked Woman, Muerte Súbita, Moliere, and Freud Skating.  These plays ran for over two years in Mexico City, and were produced across Latin America and Europe. Berman has also written the screenplays The History of Love for Alfonso Cuarón and Light for Alejandro González Iñárritu.  The film Backyard, which she wrote and co-produced, was nominated for a 2010 Oscar. 
 
THE PLAY 
Andrés, living in an abandoned building with his girlfriend Gloria, is passionately writing his third novel and refuses to leave their apartment until it is finished.  The unexpected arrival of his old friend Odiseo, recently released from prison, drastically disrupts their world and forces them to face their truth.  They will ultimately discover that sometimes destruction is needed before creation can begin anew.  Muerte Súbita  (Sudden Death) is a tour de force by Mexico’s leading contemporary playwright Sabina Berman.

WHY
We are passionate about bringing to life the work of Latin American playwrights of the highest calibre that have not been produced in New York yet.  We fervently believe in the need to offer theatre in Spanish that is raw, edgy, complex, socially conscious and that asks crucial questions about our humanity.  Muerte Súbita encompasses all of this with a delightful touch of dark humor.  Our production will include English supertitles to make it accessible to everyone.
Spanish has become the second most spoken language in the U.S. with 45 million people who speak it as a first or second language. This constitutes the largest minority in the country. We want to embrace and celebrate our culture by presenting one of the greatest contemporary Spanish language playwrights.

<p><b>Hello!</b></p>
<p>My name is Harrie Dobby &amp; I am a London-based
writer &amp; actor. I am absolutely thrilled that my first full-length play,
The Gap, will receive its <b>WORLD
PREMIERE</b> at <b>The International
New York Fringe Festival 2015</b>! The Gap originated at a 20-minute short at
the Lyric Hammersmith in London last summer, but this is the first time it will
play as a full-length play. </p>
<p>This is an incredible opportunity for myself &amp;
the rest of the cast to get our work seen on an International platform,
especially as we are one of only two companies coming to New York from London!

<p><b>Here's A Bit More
Info About The Gap</b></p>
<p>Meet Lisa, a small town girl from the USA with BIG
dreams. She applies for her passport, gets on a plane, and flies to Asia. One
week in to the trip of a lifetime, Lisa meets Dave, Mr Charisma from
London. </p>
<p>The Gap follows Lisa and Dave through the next
eighteen months of their lives. They dream of travelling the world together
forever, but when Lisa becomes pregnant, this dream begins to unravel. Is
it really possible to just strap a baby to your back and keep on going, or will
""real world” responsibilities eventually catch up with them?</p>
<p>Joined by two Irish hippies, Lisa’s bible-bashing
mom, Dave’s sex-mad best mate and her less-than-PC husband, “The Gap” is a one
act comedy, looking at what you have to sacrifice in order to be
happy. </p>

</div><div></div></div>","Hello!
My name is Harrie Dobby & I am a London-based
writer & actor. I am absolutely thrilled that my first full-length play,
The Gap, will receive its WORLD
PREMIERE at The International
New York Fringe Festival 2015! The Gap originated at a 20-minute short at
the Lyric Hammersmith in London last summer, but this is the first time it will
play as a full-length play. 
This is an incredible opportunity for myself &
the rest of the cast to get our work seen on an International platform,
especially as we are one of only two companies coming to New York from London!
Further info & tickets can be found via:
www.fringenyc.org

Here's A Bit More
Info About The Gap
Meet Lisa, a small town girl from the USA with BIG
dreams. She applies for her passport, gets on a plane, and flies to Asia. One
week in to the trip of a lifetime, Lisa meets Dave, Mr Charisma from
London. 
The Gap follows Lisa and Dave through the next
eighteen months of their lives. They dream of travelling the world together
forever, but when Lisa becomes pregnant, this dream begins to unravel. Is
it really possible to just strap a baby to your back and keep on going, or will
""real world” responsibilities eventually catch up with them?
Joined by two Irish hippies, Lisa’s bible-bashing
mom, Dave’s sex-mad best mate and her less-than-PC husband, “The Gap” is a one
act comedy, looking at what you have to sacrifice in order to be
happy. 


It's all go, it's definitely happening, but we
need your help to get us there. 


Here's How You Can Help
This is a self-funded project and we are doing all we can
to raise the funds. It obviously isn't cheap to get six actors and a techie over to New York
for two weeks in August. We are looking to raise a MINIMUM of £2000 to go towards the cost of flights, accommodation &
food (actors need to eat!). £2000 won't cover everything we need to do this
(flights alone are over £3000) but it will certainly get us along the way. If
we can raise over £2000 with this campaign, happy days! Together with some
London-based fundraising events, we're sure we can get there!
Any amount you can donate will be greatly received, but
as an added
incentive, here
are our unique awards for our wonderful backers:

<p>The year intensive also offers students a chance to work with some of Australia's most successful and awarded mature-age dance practitioners in contemporary dance, choreographic composition, ballet and yoga.

Where your generous contribution will go.
I have been fortunate enough to attract teachers and choreographers who share a similar philosophy to mine and this has created quite a journey for my trusting students, some who are heading into professional dance careers, others who have successfully auditioned into three-year degree courses at larger institutions and another who is still in high school.
Their progress has been my reward and I encourage you all to witness this in their end of year double bill season with works by Dutch/Australian choreographer Paul Selwyn Norton and Australia Council Dance Fellow Dean Walsh.

We need help paying for: extra theatre hire, more time with the choreographers than planned to complete the very detailed works and help the dancers more fully embody them. We need to hire more lighting and a performance photographer so we have images for future publicity and we require more stage management than first accounted for.
Marketing and advertising has blown my budget somewhat and with the immense task of running a new multi-functional course and final graduating production - I am learning as I go - it has been difficult to keep track of every facit.

<p>We are the co-creators of NeverYouMind Productions. We founded our production company in February 2013. Our names are Lauren Campbell, Flora Karas and Lisa-Marie Marrelli. We are three passionate women, who have a thirst for producing and creating theatre and entertainment for the world! Our mission is to enliven and stir the souls of the audience. We produce work that evokes thought, and breaks boundaries. </p>
<p><strong>The Ladies...</strong></p>
<p>Lauren has been involved in the world of theatre from the age of 4, as a dancer. While attending the Canadian College of Performing Arts, Lauren discovered her passion for acting, and has been immersed in it ever since, taking on roles in a range of theatre productions in Vancouver and the Lower Mainland. Besides acting, Lauren has a diverse range of experience as a director, producer and choreographer.</p>
<p>Flora has carved out her piece in international television and in local indie films. Her work and reputation precedes her among those that have worked along side this starlet. She functions for the highest and greatest good of each project.  Her optimism is infectious. This year, 2013, has been all about theatre, and now the heart of Vancouver will again experience her unique and beguiling energy! Enjoy.</p>
<p>Lisa-Marie has a dynamic history of theatrical experience ranging in dance, theatre and musical theatre. Along with this, she brings forth a decade of Visual Effects work in the Film Industry where her work has pushed her to have a keen eye for placement, beauty and seamless photo real designs. After working for 3 years as a Front of House Manager at a local theatre in BC, she has learned a wide range of business knowledge relating to theatre production. In the last year, Lisa was in a Production of A Particular Class of Women. This production was awarded a multitude of awards at the Fraser Valley Zone Festival and the Theatre BC Festival.</p>
<p>When the Ladies of NeverYouMind Productions put our talents and power together we are definitely a force to be reckoned with. We all have had a great journey in our individual acting careers and life experiences.  Now, everything learned about the humbling and enlivening creative process will fuel us to succeed with our own production company.  ""Without a shadow of a doubt"" as Lauren always says...</p>
<p><strong>What's Happening....</strong></p>
<p>This fall we are producing, A Particular Class of Women, by Janet Feindel. The play will run at the:</p>
<p>Waterfront Theatre on Granville Island from Oct 16<sup>th</sup>-20<sup>th</sup></p>
<p>The Columbia Theatre in New Westminster on Oct 24<sup>th</sup> and 25<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>A Particular Class of Women was written after a celebrated 1985 court case in Ontario, where a stripper was raped at knifepoint. The Judge didn't pay much attention to the crime because as he pointed out the woman/victim 'was from a particular class of women whose profession it is to promote lust’. The play gives a glimpse into the lives of 8 women working in the skin trade in the mid 1980s, when Burlesque was rapidly fading away in the club scene, and table dancing was becoming more and more popular. The play takes place in the dressing room of The Cabaret Circus, a strip club that all 8 women are employed by or have been employed by.</p>
<p> A Particular Class of Women breaks the stereotype that most have about women whose business it is to take off their clothes. This play has everything you would desire from a theatre experience: comedy, drama and a little (well, actually) A LOT of erotica!</p>
<p> The play means the world to us, and we want this play to reach its highest and greatest potential. We desire to thoroughly entertain the audience with truthful moments of these women’s lives. We feel honoured and fortunate to be working with an incredible and talented cast. As an added perk, we have an award-winning actor playing the role of the MC for the night!</p>
<p>""GIRLS, GIRLS, GIRLS!!""</p>
<p>This theatre experience has dancing and epic 80s music that will fire the audience up. This play is unique as the characters address the audience as if they were fellow strippers in the dressing room.  The characters place you directly into their world.</p>
<p>We need to raise money for our play, and we are looking to our community to help us! If you contribute you will be helping an avenue in performing arts that very much needs a ""breath of fresh air""!  NeverYouMind Productions wants to recruit people who don’t normally go to the theatre and stimulate the ones that do. We want to change this city by getting the people out to the theatre so they may experience some truth about the human condition.</p>
<p>We love what we do and in this world, isn't that the most important thing?</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Our goal is modest; we desire to raise $3000.00 to help with production costs. Money raised will go towards the theatre rental, rights to the play, costumes, sets and props and advertising.</p>
<p>All the money that we raise will be going directly into the funding of this play!</p>

<h3>What is ""Antony &amp; Cleopatra: Infinite Lives""?</h3>
</div>
<div>
<em>Antony &amp; Cleopatra: Infinite Lives</em> is a new play by J. Michael DeAngelis &amp; Pete Barry, incorporating original text by William Shakespeare.  It's the story of  an Egyptian expatriate who gets caught between two revolutionaries - her fiancée, an activist director who tries to upend his commissioned Shakespeare production, and her brother, a nationalist fresh from the violence of Tahrir Square.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The show is being staged in the grand Lower Egyptian Gallery of the <a href=""http://www.penn.museum/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Penn Museum</a>, in front of their centerpiece sphinx.  This unique and amazing venue adds a layer of spectacle and history to the show.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Drawn from still developing current events, this original play juxtaposes today's Egypt alongside Cleopatra's Egypt as seen by Shakespeare.  It puts a spotlight on theater as historical record and questions the role of the artist in politics.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The play is being produced as part of the 2012 Philly Fringe Festival by <a href=""http://www.porchroom.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Porch Room</a>, an award-winning independent theater company, and<a href=""http://www.undergroundshakespeare.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> The Underground Shakespeare Company</a>, The University of Pennsylvania's first and only group dedicated to the works of William Shakespeare.  Mr. DeAngelis and Mr. Barry are multi-award winning playwrights, whose works have been published by Samuel French and Vintage Press.  This is their third original production for the Philly Fringe, having previously presented sold-out runs of <strong><em>X/Y</em></strong>and <em><strong>Signs from</strong></em><strong> God</strong>, which recently concluded an encore production in New York City.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This is The Underground Shakespeare Company's second foray in the Fringe, having produced last year's smash hit, <em><strong>Wars &amp; Whores</strong></em><strong>.  </strong>This production, however, will be their first Fringe show to predominantly feature current students in the cast - making this an exciting first professional venture for many of them.</div>
<div>
<h3>Why We're Asking For Your Help</h3>

<h2 align=""center""><strong><em>""Ladies and Gentlemen: this is The Hystericon, a swollen darkness at the heart of a great asylum...""</em></strong></h2>
<p align=""center""> </p>
<p>Everything you will hear is true: in late 19th century Paris, Augustine, Blanche, and Geneviève are the most famous patients of Dr. Jean-Martin Charcot at the Salpêtrière insane asylum for women. They are his personal lab rats and performance artists, models and test subjects, as he conducts his experiments in ""hysteria,"" that dark recess of psychiatric medicine. Through the nascent technologies of photography, and the black arts of hypnotism and psychopharmacology, Charcot turns them from troubled women into Hysterics, celebrities of the Belle Epoque:  Augustine the Photogenic, whose pictures adorn Charcot's publications; Blanche, ""The Queen of Hysterics,"" star performer in his public lectures; and Geneviève la Pucelle, who talks to God and believes she is possessed by demons - tonight they perform for their audience an hysterical revue, a cabaret, en  <em>Comédie en vaudeville, </em>demonstrating the history and pathology of hysteria - but something seems to be going wrong. As lines are dropped and cues missed, the show starts to crumble, and the odyssey takes  turn for the strange...</p>
<p>This debut production from <strong>Good Old Neon</strong>, an avant-garde theatre company from Toronto, is written and directed by company founder <strong>Alexander Offord</strong>, who was seen featured alongside actress <strong>Nicole</strong> <strong>Wilson </strong>in the Fringe 2012 production of <em>A Madhouse Dramedy</em>. It also stars <strong>Nicholas Porteous </strong>as the malevolent disembodied voice of Charcot (Alumnae Theatre's <em>Woman of No Importance</em>),  <strong>Renée Haché</strong> (Aim for the Tangent's <em>Mature Young Adults</em>) and<strong> Lesley Robertson</strong>, seen last summer as Julia in Shakespeare in the Ruff's <em>Two Gents</em>.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Our need...</h3>
<p>The biggest expenses for any Fringe show is nearly always rehearsal space. For a show like <em>The Hystericon</em>, space takes on a new importance: the show is highly choreographed, slick and stylized, even atheletic. We need large spaces with high ceilings and hard floors to get the piece running optimally.</p>
<p>The spaces are available: the Fringe Creation Lab, Toronto's newest subsidized space for artists, and The Lower Ossington Theatre, a gorgeous cabaret space in Queen West. With your help, we'll ensure that our actors are able to live up to the full potential their prodigious talents.</p>
</div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Your donation...</h3>
<p>...will allow us to provide audiences with a product that is polished, professional, and deeply moving. <em>The Hystericon </em>was inspired by the true life-stories of Augustine, Blanche, and Geneviève, and by the hundreds of black-and-white photographs taken of them by Dr. Charcot and his associates, found in the infamous <em><em>Iconographie<br/>photographique de la Salpêtrière</em></em>, the asylum's annual photo album. It is a  tribute to a long history of forgotten women, but more than that, it allows for their redemption. The cast represents a new generation of total-actors, who are able to combine classical theatre technique with clown, dance, performance art, and physical theatre to create a work that is at once funny and disturbing, full of darkness as much as love. With your help, we can tell these stories, and in so doing, bring them to life again.</p>
<p><strong>Every cent</strong> of your money will go into budget for the show, with an emphasis on providing top-notch rehearsal spaces for our actors.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>For You</h3>
<p>At Good Old Neon, we believe what goes around comes around, and we love to reward our donors. Thus, we have a few perks:</p>
<ul>
<li>$5-$10 gets you an original button featuring a classic image from the <em><em>Iconographie photographique de la Salpêtrière,</em></em> plus a shout-out on our Twitter feed and blog!</li>
<li>$10-$25 gets you three original buttons, each with a different image, plus shout-out</li>
<li>$25-$50 gets you three buttons, a shout-out, and a special thank-you in our program</li>
<li>$50-$75 gets you three buttons, a thank you in our program, a shout-out and a copy of our poster signed by the cast</li>
<li>$100+ gets you all of the above, plus a <strong>free ticket</strong> to see the show!</li>
</ul><p>Whatever else may be said, one thing is certain: you will not have seen a show like <em>The Hystericon</em> before. We can't wait to see you there!</p>

Everything you will hear is true: in late 19th century Paris, Augustine, Blanche, and Geneviève are the most famous patients of Dr. Jean-Martin Charcot at the Salpêtrière insane asylum for women. They are his personal lab rats and performance artists, models and test subjects, as he conducts his experiments in ""hysteria,"" that dark recess of psychiatric medicine. Through the nascent technologies of photography, and the black arts of hypnotism and psychopharmacology, Charcot turns them from troubled women into Hysterics, celebrities of the Belle Epoque:  Augustine the Photogenic, whose pictures adorn Charcot's publications; Blanche, ""The Queen of Hysterics,"" star performer in his public lectures; and Geneviève la Pucelle, who talks to God and believes she is possessed by demons - tonight they perform for their audience an hysterical revue, a cabaret, en  Comédie en vaudeville, demonstrating the history and pathology of hysteria - but something seems to be going wrong. As lines are dropped and cues missed, the show starts to crumble, and the odyssey takes  turn for the strange...
This debut production from Good Old Neon, an avant-garde theatre company from Toronto, is written and directed by company founder Alexander Offord, who was seen featured alongside actress Nicole Wilson in the Fringe 2012 production of A Madhouse Dramedy. It also stars Nicholas Porteous as the malevolent disembodied voice of Charcot (Alumnae Theatre's Woman of No Importance),  Renée Haché (Aim for the Tangent's Mature Young Adults) and Lesley Robertson, seen last summer as Julia in Shakespeare in the Ruff's Two Gents.


 
Our need...
The biggest expenses for any Fringe show is nearly always rehearsal space. For a show like The Hystericon, space takes on a new importance: the show is highly choreographed, slick and stylized, even atheletic. We need large spaces with high ceilings and hard floors to get the piece running optimally.
The spaces are available: the Fringe Creation Lab, Toronto's newest subsidized space for artists, and The Lower Ossington Theatre, a gorgeous cabaret space in Queen West. With your help, we'll ensure that our actors are able to live up to the full potential their prodigious talents.

 
Your donation...
...will allow us to provide audiences with a product that is polished, professional, and deeply moving. The Hystericon was inspired by the true life-stories of Augustine, Blanche, and Geneviève, and by the hundreds of black-and-white photographs taken of them by Dr. Charcot and his associates, found in the infamous Iconographiephotographique de la Salpêtrière, the asylum's annual photo album. It is a  tribute to a long history of forgotten women, but more than that, it allows for their redemption. The cast represents a new generation of total-actors, who are able to combine classical theatre technique with clown, dance, performance art, and physical theatre to create a work that is at once funny and disturbing, full of darkness as much as love. With your help, we can tell these stories, and in so doing, bring them to life again.
Every cent of your money will go into budget for the show, with an emphasis on providing top-notch rehearsal spaces for our actors.
 
For You
At Good Old Neon, we believe what goes around comes around, and we love to reward our donors. Thus, we have a few perks:

$5-$10 gets you an original button featuring a classic image from the Iconographie photographique de la Salpêtrière, plus a shout-out on our Twitter feed and blog!
$10-$25 gets you three original buttons, each with a different image, plus shout-out
$25-$50 gets you three buttons, a shout-out, and a special thank-you in our program
$50-$75 gets you three buttons, a thank you in our program, a shout-out and a copy of our poster signed by the cast
$100+ gets you all of the above, plus a free ticket to see the show!
Whatever else may be said, one thing is certain: you will not have seen a show like The Hystericon before. We can't wait to see you there!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Let’s get clinical! Directed by award winning comedian Leigh Cameron, Generally Hospital is a comedic sketch revue about a serious place: the hospital. Impossible rules for newborn babies, songs about death, and finding love in a room filled with farts: we have you covered for an hour of laughter, tears, and other bodily functions.</p>
<p>During a sketch performance earlier this year, the show was interrupted by Ophira’s wheelchair tipping over the side of the stage and falling into the audience, resulting in a 2-week long hospital stay. When Grace came to visit, the two realized how different their perceptions of the hospital were and decided sketch comedy was the best way to confront the mysterious, confusing, and even frightening monolith that is THE HOSPITAL.</p>
<p>Calof and Smith filled out their dream-team with a diverse bunch of hilarious comedians; Leigh Cameron, Devan Islas, Sabrina Friedman, Alia Rasul, Ryan Hughes, Brie Watson, and Nicole Byblow, and thus Generally Hospital was born.</p>
<p>There is a huge stigma around illness, disability, and bodily functions. So many people living with illness feel isolated, struggling to find ways to come to terms with a life they had never imagined. The need to talk (and laugh!) about these human experiences is more important today than ever before.</p>
<p>We all have some connection to hospitals, whether we’ve experienced illness or injury, through tests and appointments, visits to a loved one, working, volunteering, or seeing it depicted on TV. This show tells the untold stories of hospitals, focusing on points of view that are underrepresented, uncomfortable, and surprisingly funny.</p>

But work always costs you something – and they’re about to pay a heavy price. For time is running out. <span>Now, they must make every second count, and find the courage to fight for justice.</span><p></p>
</div><div>
<span>Come hear them roar. Come see them shine. This is Courier 12’s production of These Shining Lives. A luminous play about love, friendship, and strength you never knew you had.</span><p></p>

<li>£65 pays for one night's royalties for the show</li>
<li>£20 pays for a day's marketing</li>
<li>£16 pays for one night's insurance</li>
<li>£10 goes towards our daily costume budget </li>
<li>If you can contribute £50 that gets you Executive Producer status; the West End and Broadway are calling! </li>
<li>Even if we don't make the full amount, everything helps towards getting the show on the road!</li>

<p>We had a sell-out run last time - we'd love to do it again!</p>
</div></div>","The Play Fresh from a sell-out run at the Lion & Unicorn Theatre in Kentish Town, Courier 12 Productions in association with KDC Theatre bring their acclaimed production of Melanie Marnich’s These Shining Lives to the Pleasance StageSpace. Shining through history, this is the true story of four ordinary women from the roaring twenties, who themselves learned how to roar.  It’s 1922 and Catherine Donohue is starting a brand-new job at Radium Dial, where she and her friends have the brightest time of their lives. But work always costs you something – and they’re about to pay a heavy price. For time is running out. Now, they must make every second count, and find the courage to fight for justice.

Come hear them roar. Come see them shine. This is Courier 12’s production of These Shining Lives. A luminous play about love, friendship, and strength you never knew you had.
  What We Need & What You Get We are looking to raise £1500 to stage These Shining Lives. This is where your lovely donations will be going:  £166 pays for one night's rent at The Pleasance Studio
£65 pays for one night's royalties for the show
£20 pays for a day's marketing
£16 pays for one night's insurance
£10 goes towards our daily costume budget 
If you can contribute £50 that gets you Executive Producer status; the West End and Broadway are calling! 
Even if we don't make the full amount, everything helps towards getting the show on the road!
   The Impact The reviews that These Shining Lives received in early 2015 made us realise that the story of the Radium Girls was so compelling, it needed telling again, to a wider audience.

In the face of certain death, these women were courageous beyond measure. They changed the world. They protected others. They made a difference.
Their legacy lives on to this day.

Teachers and Education
The timing could not be more apt for this London staging, with workers’ rights currently under
attack. The women’s story still resonates today in a world where profit, rather than human life, is
often the priority. But politics aside, above all the play showcases the humanity and courage of
these four women, and brings their almost-forgotten story into the limelight, where it belongs.

This play can work as an excellent stimulus for debate in PSHE, drama, history, sociology and
government and politics lessons, with its content traversing issues such as workers’ rights,
feminism, the Great Depression, employment tribunals, as well as the most human issues of
love and friendship and moral culpability. Below is an educational pack with two lesson
plans and accompanying powerpoints, which can be used before and after seeing the play.

<p><strong>Massman Theatre at USC</strong><br/><strong>1029 Childs Way</strong><br/><strong>Los Angeles, CA 90007</strong></p>
<p>Compiled from the original texts of the classic story, John Caird and Trevor Nunn have created a retelling of the Peter Pan legend that “elevates the work from the basement of meaningless pantomime to a national treasure.” Much darker than the story we’re all used to, Peter Pan, or the Boy Who Would Not Grow Up begs the question: what happens when we grow up (or don’t)? Our production sets out to reimagine the classic story through the lens of a twenty-something artist working in London's East End as she searches through the stories of her ancestors for a direction to her own life. Our narrator seeks to discover what it means to reconnect with her roots and the magic of the boy who would not grow up.</p>
<h3><strong>What We Need</strong></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Funding for this project goes directly into our production budget which covers venue rental, production rights, costumes, scenic design, lighting design, sound design, and props. Every penny you contribute goes to making the Neverland the most magical place it can possibly be. If we don't reach our funding goal, our Neverland will still be magical, only without the full capacity to bring the audience into the story.</p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>This production of ""Peter Pan"" brought to the Los Angeles community will bring a new generation of artists closer to the story that inspires thousands every day. By updating and reimagining the work, we hope to bring a new relevance to force  our audiences to reconsider the ways in which they have chosen to grow up and to show those who might not have made it that far yet that there is a way to move through the transition between childhood and adulthood without losing that special spark of imagination. <strong>Your donation will also help subsidize the costs of bringing school children from local Los Angeles schools to the production free of cost.</strong></p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We are constantly in need of so much more than financial support. Due to the nature of our production, if you happen to have any old art supplies lying around, we'll take 'em! We are looking to create a working artist's studio in the theatre which requires a lot of ""stuff"".</p>

<h3>About Us….<b style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px;"">.</b>
</h3>
</div>
<div>Our dream is big….<b>to bring ""SERRANO"" to Broadway</b>.  Our goal (and this is where we need YOUR help) is to first put on a 12-week production of SERRANO in Los Angeles, in January.  We are on track to do just that with your help to date!    <span><br/></span>
</div>
<div>
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<h3>
</h3>The road to Broadway starts out-of-town.  We have secured The Matrix Theatre in Los Angeles, whose artistic director saw the play and loved it and offered up their space to us.  It's a terrific theatre with a great reputation for spotlighting new work. Now all we need is a budget!  We need to raise $60,000+ to pull this off and with your help, we KNOW we can do it…..</div>
<div style=""text-align: center;"">…wouldn't it be great to say you played a pivotal part in launching SERRANO, the musical - BEFORE it hit Broadway? Any perk level you purchase will give you these bragging rights, no amount too small (or too large!)</div>
<div style=""text-align: center;"">Just think somewhere out there, there are people still talking about how they supported ""Jersey Boys"" and ""Wicked"" long before those great shows hit a Broadway stage!</div>

<p><b>….and part of our team back then!</b>   Our producer, Mark Wolper, was dreaming of Broadway as a boy - here he is above, after ""producing"" a staged production of ""Goldilocks""- (that's his sister as ""Goldilocks"", and his dad as ""Papa Bear""!)  </p>
<p>We love theatre and we love this play.  We’re totally committed to getting SERRANO into The Matrix in January - and we know if enough people feel as strongly about musical theatre as we do, that we can do it.  Yes, people have told us we're crazy to aim for Broadway without Broadway experience…. but if you think about it, if we listened to negative nellies, we wouldn't have a man on the moon, or electricity or … running water for that matter!  Nothing GREAT is accomplished by listening to naysayers, right?  So here we are … after multiple staged readings and workshops in New York and Los Angeles …  so close that we can smell the grease paint!   We are asking you, the philanthropic crowdfunders, lovers and dreamers, defender of of the arts - because you truly do understand what it is we are taking on, and what we want to accomplish - and you want to join us anyway!  Dream with us, help us turn this dream into a reality.  Because with your help, we know that we CAN mount SERRANO at The Matrix in L.A........and then it's on to Broadway!<br/></p>

</div></div>","We are overwhelmed and humbled by your generosity and belief
in Serrano.  We’re asking you to take one
more step in these final days before our campaign ends on Thursday,
September 11th.  Buy your tickets
NOW! There are still a few opening night tickets left, which includes
the VIP After Party, plus great deals to be had and advance tickets for all
performances.  We know that tickets are
going to sell like hot cakes (do hot cakes sell any more?).
Everyone who contributes to this campaign is automatically
part of the Serrano Family, which means taking the trip with us from LA to
Broadway—with special offers, opportunities and perks along the way ... So, what are you waiting for?!About Serrano, the musical….   (www.SerranoTheMusical.com), SERRANO is an homage to the French classic, ""Cyrano de Bergerac."" and is directed by the prolific, Joel Zwick (Tony nominee, no less!).  In our adaptation, “Serrano”
works for “Don Reyo,” a mobster in Little Italy with an uncouth and
foul-mouthed nephew, “Vinnie,” who just happens to have the face of Adonis.  ""Serrano"" secretly pines for the lovely ""Rosanna,"" but believes she could never see past his unsightly nose (which is too large by half!) “Don Reyo” orders “Serrano” to teach his nephew how to woo the beautiful ""Rosanna"" for his own ill gotten means, and poor Rosanna doesn’t stand a
chance.  She falls in love with the beautiful words of “Serrano,” but the
sweet face of ‘Vinnie”!  

  Here is a song from the musical,""Serrano"" - ""Serrano"" is singing of how deeply he loves ""Rosanna"" …. press ""play"" and listen to our beautiful ballad, ""Rosanna.""



About Us…..


Our dream is big….to bring ""SERRANO"" to Broadway.  Our goal (and this is where we need YOUR help) is to first put on a 12-week production of SERRANO in Los Angeles, in January.  We are on track to do just that with your help to date!    




The road to Broadway starts out-of-town.  We have secured The Matrix Theatre in Los Angeles, whose artistic director saw the play and loved it and offered up their space to us.  It's a terrific theatre with a great reputation for spotlighting new work. Now all we need is a budget!  We need to raise $60,000+ to pull this off and with your help, we KNOW we can do it…..
…wouldn't it be great to say you played a pivotal part in launching SERRANO, the musical - BEFORE it hit Broadway? Any perk level you purchase will give you these bragging rights, no amount too small (or too large!)
Just think somewhere out there, there are people still talking about how they supported ""Jersey Boys"" and ""Wicked"" long before those great shows hit a Broadway stage!


Here's part of our team today…..   

Left to right, producers Mark Wolper & Spencer Proffer, director Joel Zwick and producer, Phillipa Sledge


….and part of our team back then!   Our producer, Mark Wolper, was dreaming of Broadway as a boy - here he is above, after ""producing"" a staged production of ""Goldilocks""- (that's his sister as ""Goldilocks"", and his dad as ""Papa Bear""!)  
We love theatre and we love this play.  We’re totally committed to getting SERRANO into The Matrix in January - and we know if enough people feel as strongly about musical theatre as we do, that we can do it.  Yes, people have told us we're crazy to aim for Broadway without Broadway experience…. but if you think about it, if we listened to negative nellies, we wouldn't have a man on the moon, or electricity or … running water for that matter!  Nothing GREAT is accomplished by listening to naysayers, right?  So here we are … after multiple staged readings and workshops in New York and Los Angeles …  so close that we can smell the grease paint!   We are asking you, the philanthropic crowdfunders, lovers and dreamers, defender of of the arts - because you truly do understand what it is we are taking on, and what we want to accomplish - and you want to join us anyway!  Dream with us, help us turn this dream into a reality.  Because with your help, we know that we CAN mount SERRANO at The Matrix in L.A........and then it's on to Broadway!

Above is Serrano's beloved director, Joel Zwick - (he directed Mork & Mindy, Laverne & Shirley, Full House, Busom Buddies … oh yes, and he directed one of the most successful films of all time ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"")
We've workshopped and showcased ""Serrano"" A LOT!  It's part of the process and although we've still to stage it - we have had extremely good feedback from audiences who have attended these staged readings.  We've posted a few below o you can see that it's not just us who LOVE ""Serrano."" 

Ernest Dickerson, director of the iconic TV show, ""The Walking Dead,"" was an early supporter of ""Serrano"" - here he is with Rose Geddes, from an undisclosed location, safe from Zombies, and sharing their ""Serrano"" experience:

Joel Zwick & producer, Steve Sunshine, being interviewed on ""Innovation Crush"" a popular online show with over 600,000 subscribers! 

Just listening to Joel Zwick, and our producer, Steve Sunshine, talk about starting out in the industry is entertaining!  The interview is more anecdotal and humorous than it is serious - but the gems just kept on coming - it's a really fun interview by Chris Denson, of Innovation Crush who clearly did his homework.  Our boys tell tales from the sets of iconic TV shows and they even ""throw down"" in a duel we could call  ""the battle of the name drop""!  From Gary Marshall to Tom Hanks, & Jon Stewart to Emmanuel Lewis…listen here for the entire interview….

 ""RADIO INTERVIEW W/JOEL ZWICK & STEVE SUNSHINE"" 




Above: Chris Denson (left), Steve Sunshine (middle) Joel Zwick (right) being interviewed about their careers and the road to here on SERRANO! (we learned so much - like did you know that Steven Spielberg shadowed Joel on the set of Laverne & Shirley to learn how to direct comedy?  And we are offering a week to shadow Joel on a set of a TV show as a perk - could you be the next Spielberg?!  Take a listen - gems!

Jerry Penicoli live from the Emmy's LOVES Serrano - and like us, believes we can make it to Broadway!


Our Staged Readings and Workshops...
Our multiple staged readings in NY and LA have been met with great enthusiasm, even standing ovations (even actors, Greg Kinnear and Mario Lopez have seen it and loved it!  See below under ""Testimonials"")  
Helmed by our Tony nominee Joel Zwick, we've put together a talented creative team, that includes Broadway actors who LOVE this show, and are so PASSIONATE about being in SERRANO in January that they are helping us think up perks to give away in return for your support!  ""SERRANO"" himself has offered to serenade a limited number of donors (or their loved ones!) with one song from ""SERRANO"" over Skype!  And he's a Broadway actor no less!  Now that's serious brownie points in ANY relationship!  


""Serrano"" pining for the love of his life, ""Rosanna""

The photo below is from an earlier SERRANO workshop.  ""SERRANO"" tries to give ""Vinnie"" some education - no easy job!  ""Vinnie"" is a handful, and a very ""bad boy"". 
""Serrano"" & ""Vinnie"" in rehearsal Our Perks…...
BEFORE WE EXCITE YOU WITH OUR PERKS…. PLEASE KNOW THAT ANY OF OUR PERKS CAN BE PURCHASED FOR YOURSELF, OR GIFTED TO A FRIEND OR FAMILY MEMBER, LOVED ONE OR WORK MATE! We've sold perks to donors in New Zealand, England, Australia, Hong Kong and Greece!   
In return for your pledges, we created some really exciting higher level Indiegogo rewards -- but it can't be stated strongly enough that your support for us at every level is equally important to us, whether purchasing ""early bird"" or ""advanced tickets,"" or venturing into the larger perks, such as a whole week shadowing director, Joel Zwick on a popular TV show, or a week with him in rehearsals on ""Serrano"".  Would you like to ""feel"" like a producer on our L.A. production?  We have Associate Producer and Executive Producer titles on offer that will make you feel like royalty!  Although they are only what we call, ""vanity credits,"" (meaning you won't be burdened with any financial, legal, creative or business attachments etc), you'll still get a taste of what it ""feels"" like to be a producer on a successful show - and in Los Angeles no less!  Additionally, we have an amazing opportunity for a meet and greet with award winning producer, Mark Wolper from the Wolper Organization and, if you’ve dreamed of acting, a chance to audition for the Wolper Organization's shows for three years!   We have sold out all our tickets to ""Dancing with the Stars,""  ""The Voice,""  ""American Idol,"" and ""So You Think You Can Dance"" -  but we still have GREAT perks available for anyone interested in the entertainment industry!   FOR A FULL LISTING AND THE ""DISCLAIMERS"" FOR OUR PERKS, PLEASE VISIT OUR SERRANO WEBSITE 
**CLICK HERE TO LISTEN**
 



You can proudly say you received all of these perks back before ""Serrano"" was a huge success on Broadway! (There are more incentives but we have a limited amount of space here - the entire list is posted to the right!)

<h3>Our Story<br/>
</h3>
<b>Where
We're Coming From:</b>
Kurt Elftmann: I'm artistic director and co-founder of Tonic Theater Company <a href=""http://www.tonictheater.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.tonictheater.org</a>. I’ve been a
performer all my life acting in classics from Sophocles to Shakespeare to
Tennessee Williams and along the way I’ve had the privilege of being a part of
some really fine ensemble companies. However what I’ve come to enjoy most is
helping to develop new plays. I realized that I wanted to build a
theater company that would develop and produce new plays about history and
science. Named after a favorite hangout in DC, over the past two years, Tonic Theater Company has produced readings of
new plays around Washington, DC, including at the <b>2014 Kennedy Center
Page-to Stage Festival</b>. This year Tonic continues its free public readings,
including at least one reading in partnership with the <b>National Academy of
Sciences </b>(NAS). In January 2015 Tonic Theater Company participated in a
discussion at the NAS to identify areas where the National Academy of Sciences
could support, encourage and/or facilitate the development and production of
theater that focuses on science themes, scientists, and the role of science in
society. Now it's time for Tonic's first production.<br/><ul>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Why a Campaign?</b> Whether people know it or not they're hungry for stories about history and science. Many movies, TV shows and Broadway plays are based on actual events which the authors use as a springboard to present their story. Hollywood wants science in movies so much that our friends at the National Academy of Sciences started <b>The Science &amp; Entertainment Exchange</b> just to help Tinseltown with its science. Tonic
Theater Company will produce rich and entertaining new
plays that
increase public understanding
of history and science, but we need your help. <i>Darwin at Down</i>, our
first production, is vitally important to us as a means of introducing ourselves
to several communities in the Washington, DC area, including the scientific and
theater communities. It will also be the first opportunity for several
institutions that may fund or support Tonic Theater Company to see our work, that's why we need your help. We need
every single penny of our $10,000 budget to take this all-important first step. Once
taken, Tonic Theater Company will be off and running.<span>  </span></p>
<b>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <b>
</b><p><b>Location. Location! Location?</b> Rehearsal and performance spaces in Washington, DC are expensive and we also need to pay all the artists that come together to work on the show and make it happen. To realize our first production Tonic needs to raise $10,000. $2400 of this is already committed to our performance space at the District of Columbia Arts Center (DCAC) and nearly a like amount will be set aside for rehearsal space (this doesn't come free with a theater space). With nearly $4800 already accounted for, we still need to consider costumes, props, our minimal set and publicity, as well as paying everyone who makes the show happen.The pay for our designer team, actors and crew will be very modest, considering we will rehearse for three weeks and perform for three more, but everyone involved is dedicated to making Darwin at Down a success. It's very much a labor of love.</p>
<p><b>The Show Must Go On:</b> While Tonic can still manage to produce <i>Darwin at Down</i> for less than $10,000, we would prefer that we don't have to. We want to give Gino DiIorio's play the highest production values we can right now. Your donations will help make that happen. And if we raise more than $10,000, every bit of it will go into making what promises to be a strong production shine even more. </p>
<p><b>Thanking You:</b> How to thank and reward people for helping fund <i>Darwin at Down</i> has been on our minds a lot. We have some very show-specific and Tonic-specific rewards for you, ranging from thanks on Tonic Theater Company's website, to Tonic coffee mugs or martini glasses, a special edition of the <i>Darwin at Down</i> script, access to open rehearsals, tickets to the show, and special behind the scenes interviews and footage.<br/></p>

Our Story

Where
We're Coming From:
Kurt Elftmann: I'm artistic director and co-founder of Tonic Theater Company www.tonictheater.org. I’ve been a
performer all my life acting in classics from Sophocles to Shakespeare to
Tennessee Williams and along the way I’ve had the privilege of being a part of
some really fine ensemble companies. However what I’ve come to enjoy most is
helping to develop new plays. I realized that I wanted to build a
theater company that would develop and produce new plays about history and
science. Named after a favorite hangout in DC, over the past two years, Tonic Theater Company has produced readings of
new plays around Washington, DC, including at the 2014 Kennedy Center
Page-to Stage Festival. This year Tonic continues its free public readings,
including at least one reading in partnership with the National Academy of
Sciences (NAS). In January 2015 Tonic Theater Company participated in a
discussion at the NAS to identify areas where the National Academy of Sciences
could support, encourage and/or facilitate the development and production of
theater that focuses on science themes, scientists, and the role of science in
society. Now it's time for Tonic's first production.



Why a Campaign? Whether people know it or not they're hungry for stories about history and science. Many movies, TV shows and Broadway plays are based on actual events which the authors use as a springboard to present their story. Hollywood wants science in movies so much that our friends at the National Academy of Sciences started The Science & Entertainment Exchange just to help Tinseltown with its science. Tonic
Theater Company will produce rich and entertaining new
plays that
increase public understanding
of history and science, but we need your help. Darwin at Down, our
first production, is vitally important to us as a means of introducing ourselves
to several communities in the Washington, DC area, including the scientific and
theater communities. It will also be the first opportunity for several
institutions that may fund or support Tonic Theater Company to see our work, that's why we need your help. We need
every single penny of our $10,000 budget to take this all-important first step. Once
taken, Tonic Theater Company will be off and running.  

What We Can Build Together: Darwin at Down is Tonic Theater Company's first production but it won't be our last. With your help we can build a company that produces great new plays about history and science. Already we're gearing up for our second production as part of the Women's Voices Theater Festival in Washington, DC, and we'll continue to produce free readings around DC to increase our audience reach. The best way to spread our message is by showing audiences what we do best, live theater. You're help is vital to us. By donating to Tonic today you're also laying a solid foundation for our future.

<p></p>
<p>A horse-drawn
circus is certainly a romantic way to move about the country. We believe this
lifestyle carries greater significance than nostalgic charm. Horses require little more than grass, water and room to run. Much more sustainable than
motorised transport that relies on air-polluting fossil fuels, factory
machined parts, and global distribution networks. </p>
<p>A horse drawn circus can’t get far without horses. We realized from the beginning that an experienced horse person was essential. A lot of unexpected things can happen on the road. A horse can throw a shoe, get spooked or become ill. The required skills appeared in the person of Raina Jones. Raina has worked on horse-logging crews and pulled a canal barge. She’s been riding, grooming and training horses all her life. We take the safety of the horses very seriously and Elsewhere’s horses are in good hands.<br/></p>
<p>Slower travel
allows for a deeper connection with the land you are crossing. Trees are
intoxicatingly wonderful at 3 miles an hour - harder to appreciate at 60. As
more people take pleasure in nature, the greater the likelihood that Scotland’s
natural beauty will grow.</p>
<p>While we
embrace the marvels a high-tech society – people around the world can follow <i>Elsewhere </i>through social media – we also
believe these modern times can learn a lot from traditional lifestyles.</p>
<p>In an age of
digital entertainment, live performance and real interaction with living things
are especially important to a healthy culture. Quality human experiences filled
with creative expression, positive community, shared laughter, music, and
celebration, are all possible – and often more genuine – without depending on
sophisticated technologies. </p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>The Travellers of Elsewhere are most at home in the wild greenwood. We would love to see Scotland’s forests spread from coast to coast. To help this along, we will be planting trees throughout the tour. </p>

Additionally, we have found a piece of land near the Pentland Hills wanting the cultivation of a new forest. We will match each of the Trust trees with another planted on this site. Let’s plant at least 1000 trees, or even 10,000.</p>

<p>Elsewhere is the creative partnership of former Directors of te POOKa, a performing arts charity in Edinburgh, Scotland.  Until it closed in 2011, te POOKa produced some of Scotland’s most innovative and engaging circus theatre.  Renowned for creating enchanted spaces in unexpected locations, te POOKa performed in village halls, grand ballrooms, castles, fields and forests from Edinburgh to the Outer Hebrides and everywhere in between. We unleashed a dragon in the woods of Tain and hosted a Midsummer Faerie Ball on the lawns of Gleneagles. It has been a privilege to share our circus and story magic with audiences in so many stunning settings. </p>

<i>BBC filming the te POOKa show Big Willow</i><p></p>
<p>Scotland has incredible scenery, and we take great delight celebrating the natural world.  We operate a leave-no-trace policy, which includes: </p>
<ul>
<li>Sifting through bonfire ashes for stray nails and bits of wire  </li>
<li>Building sets with recycled materials </li>
<li>Composting all food waste  </li>
<li>Shopping in farmers markets and local retailers </li>
<li>Always looking for ways to lighten our environmental impact</li>
</ul>
<p>We wanted our next project after te POOKa to be even more sustainable.  After years of driving around the country in vans, we realised that burning diesel was potentially offsetting the rest of our ecological efforts. Also, we wished to inspire in others the enchantment we found in the woods we visited. From these desires  came <i>The Travellers of Elsewhere</i>: Scotland’s first horse-drawn circus since the middle of last century. </p>

</div></div>","We are happy to announce that
Elsewhere tour is going forward. Obviously we did not do as well as we would
have liked on our fundraising. It’s resulted into a situation where we are very
much scraping the bottom of the treasure chest to create this. We still have until
Monday night to raise a few more pounds and now it is making a huge difference
how difficult this all will be. We will spend the summer touring with very
little money and lots of love in our hearts.

So a last little bid, please share, like and donate to our project. We need
every last little bit, how ever little. 
Meet Rob and Suzy and see one of the locations where the trees from our tree planting perk will be growing.Meet Jess, our art director!!!As featured in

STV, 21st April 2015.


Permaculture Magazine, 13th April 2015.


The
Travellers of Elsewhere is a solar powered horse-drawn travelling
show that combines circus and theatre with conversation on
sustainable lifestyles. Blending storytelling, circus, live music, and magic, we invite you to an
unforgettable immersive experience. Step inside another world, until now, found only
in folklore. 
The Travellers of Elsewhere hit the road properly in July, heading north from
Tir Na Nog to Calander, Killin, Aberfeldy, Pitlochry and Crieff.  
Along the way we will be: 

welcoming you to
     the world of Elsewhere
living
     low-impact and close to nature 
offering free workshops in theatre and circus
planting
     trees (see more below)
covering
     over 200 miles by foot and hoof

With
your support the
magic of Elsewhere will reach as many people as possible, By reaching our goal of £25,000, we will produce the circus of our wildest dreams. If we raise less than that, The Travellers of Elsewhere will still go ahead. For example, £5000 pays pays for one horse and all its needs, upgrading our existing carriage and the solar panels - enough to get us moving. More support = a bigger circus. We dream big, do you?We relish this awesome challenge and the opportunity to make something really unique and inspiring.




A horse-drawn
circus is certainly a romantic way to move about the country. We believe this
lifestyle carries greater significance than nostalgic charm. Horses require little more than grass, water and room to run. Much more sustainable than
motorised transport that relies on air-polluting fossil fuels, factory
machined parts, and global distribution networks. 
A horse drawn circus can’t get far without horses. We realized from the beginning that an experienced horse person was essential. A lot of unexpected things can happen on the road. A horse can throw a shoe, get spooked or become ill. The required skills appeared in the person of Raina Jones. Raina has worked on horse-logging crews and pulled a canal barge. She’s been riding, grooming and training horses all her life. We take the safety of the horses very seriously and Elsewhere’s horses are in good hands.
Slower travel
allows for a deeper connection with the land you are crossing. Trees are
intoxicatingly wonderful at 3 miles an hour - harder to appreciate at 60. As
more people take pleasure in nature, the greater the likelihood that Scotland’s
natural beauty will grow.
While we
embrace the marvels a high-tech society – people around the world can follow Elsewhere through social media – we also
believe these modern times can learn a lot from traditional lifestyles.
In an age of
digital entertainment, live performance and real interaction with living things
are especially important to a healthy culture. Quality human experiences filled
with creative expression, positive community, shared laughter, music, and
celebration, are all possible – and often more genuine – without depending on
sophisticated technologies. 




The Travellers of Elsewhere are most at home in the wild greenwood. We would love to see Scotland’s forests spread from coast to coast. To help this along, we will be planting trees throughout the tour. 
Please check out the £15 Plant a Tree perk. We have teamed up with Woodland Trust Scotland and for every £15 you donate, £5 will go directly to the Trust as their buy a tree incentive. Additionally, we have found a piece of land near the Pentland Hills wanting the cultivation of a new forest. We will match each of the Trust trees with another planted on this site. Let’s plant at least 1000 trees, or even 10,000.


Making new
friends is one of the great joys of travel. Elsewhere
has partnered with the Scottish Community Drama Association to help us include
as many people in our project as possible.  We are offering a free in-depth workshop session with the directors and cast to anyone interested in creating their own Elsewhere persona and taking part in a
live performance.  If you would like to work with a professional performance
company on a highly unique production, please get in touch.
This is an
awesome challenge and we relish the opportunity to make something really unique
and inspiring.



Sit spell bound under a leafy canopy as a storyteller calls to life tales from myth and legend. Woodland sprites spring from the trees with impressive aerial artistry. Jugglers dazzles with feats of dexterous manipulation beyond comprehension. Dance to the lively tunes of Elvish musicians. This is a day you will remember and talk about forever.




This is our fantastically handsome, custom made carriage. She was built by Dan Brown of Labryrinth, New Castle. You’ll agree he did a remarkable job. Indeed, her like has never been seen before. But two more wagons are needed to carry all the tents, costumes, props, cooking gear, food, feed, and tools of touring circus.
Of course the biggest wildcard when performing outdoors in Scotland is the weather. We don’t mind walking through windy rain, (Well, we don’t mind that much.) But our audiences have to be cozy and dry. 

Consultations with a certified rigger have lead to an approved workable design for a canopy that hangs from the trees and is adaptable to different locations. Most importantly, visitors to Elsewhere will enjoy a comfortable experience whatever the weather. 



Due to the
structure of crowd funding platforms such as Indiegogo, 25% of the funding target
will go directly into producing this campaign. The 75% majority of the money will
then be used to make this project happen. This is how we spend it.


Horses


Three strong and sturdy cobs for our wagons and carriage.  Cobs are the traditional choice among horse travellers for generations. They are a tough, hardy breed, well able to handle the rigors of life in the Scottish hills.

Equipment for the horses


Full harnesses, brushes, hoof picks, new shoes, hay and portable shelter to make sure that our horses are comfortable and happy pulling us around the country side. We also require vet and farrier services, as well as insurance. 

Wagons



Our existing carriage will have to take the weight of several performers at once and serve as a stable platform for hand-stands and other acrobatics. To ensure that it is safe and suitable as circus equipment, it requires a more robust suspension with stronger axles and wheels.


We will also purchase two drays – one to carry the canvas tents and one to serve as the kitchen wagon and tool store. This second dray will be fitted with cupboards for the tools and kitchen equipment. It will have a comfortable, sheltered interior in the event that any performers or crew members are too ill or injured to walk.


Tent


Over 350 square meters of lovely burgundy Regentex TM water and rot proofed canvas; as well as the ropes, bamboo poles, eyelets and other hardware to safely construct and rig our otherworldly circus tent. 

Solar Panels and Batteries


We will have some electrical devices and small electrical effects. These will be charged from solar panels on the roof of the kitchen wagon. 

Please view a more accurate breakdown of the budget here.

<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Who we are</span></strong></p>
<p>When Bere’sheet Ballet was formed, it immediately took on a life of its own, attracting artists who had suffered sexual abuse, domestic violence, spiritual and cult abuse, and cancer survivors. For many, the company became a haven for the hurting, and dance became their path of healing.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">What we do....</span></strong></p>
</div>
<p>Because of that universal assignment for us, every concert we perform is a benefit.  25% of the ticket price goes to a fund to help those in need. We believe that we can change the planet – one person at a time. We are completely dependent on funding from people like you who are of the same heart and mind.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Our present project...</span></strong></p>
<p>We are raising funds for the editing and completion of our latest film and its premiere in the Fall of this year:  “Repair the World.” It is a documentary with interviews of various women and their stories, featuring dance, and Grammy winner Cynthia Clawson. We will need: $2,500 for the completion of the editing of the film. $2,500 for theater rental for the World Premiere. $1,500 for the music rights .$500 for the reproduction of the DVDs</p>
<p>We performed <em>Repair the World</em> in October 2011. The concert focuses on raising consciousness not only of the human condition, but as human beings: “Any act of kindness – no matter how great or how small, repairs the world.”  We are hoping to bring this awareness with <em>Repair the World</em> – the film - to a global venue through distribution. I am inviting you to participate in that vision for us...helping us to make the premiere of the film in the Fall of this year...2012...a success.

<p> </p></div>","Who we are
When Bere’sheet Ballet was formed, it immediately took on a life of its own, attracting artists who had suffered sexual abuse, domestic violence, spiritual and cult abuse, and cancer survivors. For many, the company became a haven for the hurting, and dance became their path of healing.
What we do....

Because of that universal assignment for us, every concert we perform is a benefit.  25% of the ticket price goes to a fund to help those in need. We believe that we can change the planet – one person at a time. We are completely dependent on funding from people like you who are of the same heart and mind.
Our present project...
We are raising funds for the editing and completion of our latest film and its premiere in the Fall of this year:  “Repair the World.” It is a documentary with interviews of various women and their stories, featuring dance, and Grammy winner Cynthia Clawson. We will need: $2,500 for the completion of the editing of the film. $2,500 for theater rental for the World Premiere. $1,500 for the music rights .$500 for the reproduction of the DVDs
We performed Repair the World in October 2011. The concert focuses on raising consciousness not only of the human condition, but as human beings: “Any act of kindness – no matter how great or how small, repairs the world.”  We are hoping to bring this awareness with Repair the World – the film - to a global venue through distribution. I am inviting you to participate in that vision for us...helping us to make the premiere of the film in the Fall of this year...2012...a success. Bere’sheet Ballet is a 501-C-3 non- profit organization.

Our track record....
For the last fourteen years, Bere’sheet Ballet has been successful in helping individuals through temporary crisis.We havepaid co-pays, or helped pay for medical exams and tests. We have bought several prostheses for breast cancer survivors. We’ve purchased groceries and gasoline, paid rent, electric bills and even made a few car payments.

<h3>Our 'Herstory'</h3>
<h3></h3>
<p>In 1983, Paula Franklin, a black woman at Brown, felt the need for more student choreography on campus. That year, she choreographed a piece for the annual Fall Dance Concert, called ""Portrait of a Studio."" This piece was the precursor to Fusion Dance Company. In the spring semester of the same academic year,  auditions were held to form a diverse company of 23 students. Over the past 32 years, Fusion has tried to uphold this tradition as a multi-cultural, multi-ethnic group of both men and women who perform a variety of styles and do not conform to modern day constraints on body shape, size, dance style or choreography.</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3></h3>
<h3>What We Do </h3>
<p>Every year, Fusion Dance Company works tirelessly to produce our Annual Spring Show. We give every company member the opportunity to choreograph a piece in any style he or she wishes. The final product is an inspiring, entertaining, and eclectic collection of dances that never fails to move audience members, regardless of their previous background or experience. In addition to our Spring Show, we perform several times throughout the year for fundraisers and charity events and regularly organize workshops open to the entire student body. Every dancer holds a unique leadership position within the company, enabling members to contribute managerially as well as artistically. </p>

Cost of "" Video clip of flashmob"": 1750 USD
Accommodation costs of the dancer and her asistant for 5 days : 1250 USD



I organized a workshop in Cervantes -İstanbul to teach this flashmob

Μια θεατρική
παράσταση βασισμένη στην ερωτική
επιστολογραφία της Μαρίνας Τσβετάγιεβα ""Γράμματα στον Ελικώνα"". Η πρεμιέρα της
έχει προγραμματιστεί για τις 5 Δεκεμβρίου

<h4>Α few words on the performance</h4><p><i>
“I
do not even know: Are you in my life? In the depths of my soul –
you are not. But right there, in the banks of my soul, in that
defined between: earth and sky, soul and body, dog and wolf, before
the sleep, after the dream, there where Me is not Me anymore, and my
dog is no longer mine, there, you do not only exist, but you solely
exist.”</i> (Marina Tsvetaeva)</p>
<p>
The
performance is a journey encountering love. A dive into the depths of
the human soul, which never stopped seeking it. Love is a state of
being and a primary need. The archetype of female and male exists in
our cells beyond our gender and sexual identity. Beyond our personal
story, there is a common place for all of us in love and that is our
body and our soul. Body is more identified with personality, the
soul with our being. Are those two separate? And this deeper
existential human need for union and perfection? With whom do we want
to become one? The face is just a start. Who is the other? Is
he/she away from us or does he/she reside somewhere within us? We, lovers,
crave, ask for exclusivity, duration, confidence, freedom. From whom
do we ask of it? How much do we give ourselves, those things we seek
from each other? In the performance, the actors sometimes are the
narrators and sometimes serve the two main voices of the performance,
the masculine and the feminine. They are the ones in Love. Those who
want to Love and Be Loved.</p><h4 style="""">Λίγα λόγια για την παράσταση</h4>
<p><i>
“Ούτε καν
ξέρω: Είστε στη ζωή μου; Στις εκτάσεις
της ψυχής μου - όχι. Αλλά εκεί, στις όχθες
της ψυχής, σε αυτό το ορισμένο ανάμεσα
σε: γη και ουρανό, ψυχή και σώμα, σκύλο
και λύκο, πριν τον ύπνο, μετά το όνειρο,
εκεί όπου εγώ δεν είμαι πια εγώ, κι ο
σκύλος μου δεν είναι πια δικός μου, εκεί
όχι μόνο είστε, αλλά είστε μόνο εσείς.""  </i>(Μαρίνα Τσβετάγιεβα)</p>
<p style="""">
Η
παράσταση είναι ένα ταξίδι συνάντησης
με τον έρωτα. Μία κατάδυση στα βάθη της
ανθρώπινης ψυχής που δεν έπαψε ποτέ να
τον αναζητάει. Ο έρωτας είναι κατάσταση
της ύπαρξης και πρωταρχική της ανάγκη.
Το αρχέτυπο του θηλυκού και του αρσενικού
υπάρχει στα κύτταρά μας πέρα από το φύλο
και τη σεξουαλική μας ταυτότητα. Πέρα
από την προσωπική μας ιστορία, υπάρχει
ένας κοινός τόπος για όλους μας στον
έρωτα και αυτός είναι το σώμα μας και η
ψυχή μας. Το σώμα περισσότερο ταυτισμένο
με την προσωπικότητα, η ψυχή με την
ύπαρξη. Είναι ξέχωρα αυτά τα δύο; Και
αυτή η βαθύτερη υπαρξιακή ανάγκη του
ανθρώπου για ένωση και τελείωση; Με
ποιόν θέλουμε να ενωθούμε; Ποιός είναι
ο άλλος; Είναι έξω από εμάς ή κατοικεί
κάπου μέσα μας; Οι ερωτευμένοι ποθούμε,
ζητάμε αποκλειστικότητα, διάρκεια,
εμπιστοσύνη, ελευθερία. Από ποιον τα
ζητάμε; Πόσο δίνουμε στον εαυτό μας όλα
αυτά που αναζητάμε από τον άλλο; Στην
παράσταση οι ηθοποιοί άλλοτε είναι
αφηγητές και άλλοτε υπηρετούν τις δύο
κύριες φωνές του έργου, την αρσενική
και τη θηλυκή. Είναι οι Ερωτευμένοι.
Aυτοί
που θέλουν να Αγαπήσουν και να Αγαπηθούν.</p><h3 style="""">

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>. Here are some of the hurdles we will have to jump:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Profits</b>: With a small house (max 45 seats) and only 4 performances we really want to sell out, as often as possible, every night if we can! We believe in paid actors so after Fringe and our venue get their cuts we would like to pay our talented cast and crew for their hard work</li>
<li>
<b>Standing Out</b>: With over 100 performances featured all over DC for Fringe Festival, we have to make sure ours is a top pick. With only one weekend of performances we will have a short amount of time to make a great impression.</li>
<li>
<b>Production Costs</b>: As a group of young, independent theater artists  it's necessary that most of our budget come from fundraising, But If we don't reach our goal the show still must go on. </li>
<li>
<b>Time &amp; Talent</b>: Fringe Festival runs July 9-26th. Starting in May that gives us a little over 2 months to rehearse the show, design and acquire all of our production materials, raise our budget, launch a great marketing and social media campaign, and promote, promote, promote! </li>
</ul>
<p>How we'll make the jump: </p> <ul>
<li>
<i>A strong social media &amp; marketing campaign</i>: Fringe Festival is heavily shared and documented through Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. With a presence on all three of these sites where we will share original content from our website blog we plan to keep our fans and followers engaged with our production as well as the entire festival. </li> <li>
<i>Advertising</i>: Our $500 advertising budget will go towards print and online ads with DC publications that heavily cover Fringe.</li>
<li>Printed materials: Our production team and cast will act as ambassadors for our project, distributing postcards, posters, and business cards around the DC Metro area.</li>
<li>
<i>Pre-festival coverage</i>: We will actively pursue opportunities for pre-festival press pieces and exposure to increase audience interest and attendance.</li>
<li>
<i>Volunteer opportunities</i>: We are offering a volunteer costume designer position for a student design student looking to gain experience in their field. In addition, we will be recruiting other theater enthusiasts to assist during tech week and performances. </li>
<li>
<i>A diversified team</i>: To support the management of our project we have brought on Katie Morgan, an experienced project management professional with experience in the political and non-profit fields.

<h2>Cupcake Lady Productions' Inaugural Season</h2>
<h3>
<br/>Help Us Create Delicious Theatre! </h3>
<p>Cupcake Lady Productions has already begun - in our offbeat way - to create entertainment that explores relatable emotions and situations, and challenges preconceptions. As we continue to produce smaller live events and multimedia, we would love to get a season of theatre off the ground. We are hoping to kick things off with an unconventional production of Sam Shepard's True West.</p>
<p>And to make it all happen, we need your help...</p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Where Your Money Goes</span></strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>To do these shows right, we're seeking funds for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Theatre! We're looking for a full week's rental in a central, well-maintained New York theatre space. Time enough for load-in, tech, and Thurs-Sun performances.</li>
<li>Rights - Paying for the permission to do these incredible and copywrighted plays</li>
<li>Costume, Sets, Lights and Sound - Good design will help our actors and audience be transported into the world of the play. For True West, sets will likely be the biggest design expense: a realistic approximation of a kitchen!</li>
<li>Toasters - Seriously, guys. We need like, fifty toasters. And other props, too.</li>
<li>Postcards, posters, etc. - Promotional material! We want to fill those seats so as many people as possible will see the show!</li>
<li>And, hopefully, if we have a surplus, we can provide a stipend to a pro Stage Manager (at the least), fund unexpected incidental expenses, and of course, put money into growing the company and putting up the next shows!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Your Motivation</h3>
<p>In return, you can get these VERY COOL things (please see ""perks"" for the full breakdown):</p>
<p>Cupcake Lady Productions Swag - brand-new magnets and even t-shirts!</p>
<p>Complimentary tickets to True West*</p>
<p>A custom video</p>
<p>Our eternal love and gratitude</p>
<p>CUPCAKES</p>
<p> *If you will be out of town during the performances, please contact us at cupcakeladyproductions@gmail.com</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This campaign will truly get the ball rolling for Cupcake Lady Productions. Our first few shows will help establish us as a company, and from there we can get on our way to acheiving Not for Profit status, producing more of our brand of entertainment, and reaching more people. Every single dollar makes a world of difference.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>For those who are unable to help us financially, there are other ways to get involved:</p>
<ul>
<li>Volunteer - we'll always need extra hands, whether it be at the box office the night of the show, or simply passing out our postcards</li>
<li>Like us! Cupcake Lady Productions is all over social media. you can like us on Facebook (/cupcakeladyproductions), follow us on Twitter (@CupcakeLadyProd) and subscribe to our YouTube channel (/CupcakeLadyProd).</li>

Equal parts black comedy and psychological drama, THE WIFE centers around Ruth, a Hasidic woman who befriends her white neighbors. What seems at first an innocent relationship quickly escalates, and the play spirals into a series of events which unravel an entire community. With wit, humor, and wisdom, Smith’s play exposes the best and worst parts of humanity, kind people turn venomous, and cruel people act with compassion.

Some Background 

a note from the playwright...Over the last decade, neighborhoods like south Williamsburg have experienced the ambient waves of cultural isolationism butting heads with the New Order that is springing up around the city in spurts of condos and Whole Foods. People who have lived in the same four block radius for generations are now seeing their neighborhoods infested with artists, marketing employees, young gentried families and bars/restaurants with themes of rustic simulation (fake English bars, fake sailor bars) that would make Baudrillard weep. Recently the Hasidic neighborhoods of South Williamsburg have organized against what they call ""a plague of artists"", passing city ordinances blocking other ways of life in their public urban areas.
Through the course of the play, every character shows off a radically different side of their being, based on the (sometimes random) person they are talking to. Kind people turn venomous; cruel people are reduced to acts of compassion. The point is to say that at the core of our humanity is also the need to suppress our best qualities in the face of other people whose appearance is different than ours. I don't really know why people (myself included) do that, but I do hope people think about it as they're leaving the production.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>For over a decade, we have been passionately working on a performance piece that would combine the elements of a modern day pop concert with a character-driven, theatrical storyline exploring the psychology of a moment in time. We took our inspiration from the groundbreaking concert stagings of the early 90s, like those of Madonna and Janet Jackson. The song, dance and multimedia elements combined with the social provocations that go hand in hand with these mega dance concerts has always been a point of fascination for us. Add into the mix our love of the theater and nostalgia for the innocence of the 1990s, and <a href=""thegroovefactorymusical.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><em>The Groove Factory</em></a> was born: a musical that looks at the last glory days of New York City's mega-dance clubs through the filter of the impending turn of the Millennium accompanied by global Y2K paranoia. We are ecstatic to share that T<em>he Groove Factory</em> has been chosen as an official selection of New York Musical Theatre Festival 2012*, a highly competitive platform to showcase original musicals- in other words the ""Sundance"" of Musical Theater.  </p>
<p><strong>With an official opening night set of July 24th, we ask for your support! </strong></p>
<p>Your contributions will help make The Groove Factory not only the biggest hit of the festival, but will lay the foundation neccesary for the next step - a commercial run.  Our goal is to mount the professional quality production that will get high powered theater producers and investors attention.  Please help us make this goal a reality.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This will be ground breaking for the Musical Theater world, with its all-electronic Dance/Pop score it will be the first of its kind (think about what Rent did for Rock musicals).

<p>Socially, the story will transport an audience to an America right before the War on Terror, economic recessions and iPhones.  For one night, the theater will be filled with the innocence of the decadent 90s, and let's be honest- who couldn't use that sort of escape.  Check your iPhone at the door and grab your beeper!  Better yet, leave it all behind. </p>

This urgent one-man show gets people asking questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why aren’t we talking about an international sanitation crisis that kills a child every twenty seconds, when we could be investing in sustainable solutions that promote health and prosperity?</li>
<li>Why should we accept a world that makes us feel guilty for doing something everyone does, when we could be creating one that is hospitable to our whole bodies and their needs?</li>
<li>Why is our worth measured solely by how much we consume, when the “waste” we flush into our drinking water could be fertilizing our fields and fueling our cities?</li>
</ul><h2><strong>Give A $h*t</strong></h2>
<p>The POOP Project has been accepted to premiere a new one-man show, <em>Eat $h*t: How Our Waste Can Save the World</em>, at the prestigious Edinburgh International Fringe Festival in August 2012.

<p>By funding this show, you will be exposing a critical, unseen issue to a diverse audience with the power to spread this message around the world.

The People’s Own Organic Power Project (www.thePOOPproject.org) is on a mission to heal the cultural shame that makes potty talk taboo. This August, we’ll be asking unsuspecting audience members to Eat $h*t at the Edinburgh International Fringe Festival, the world’s largest and most diverse arts festival. This urgent one-man show gets people asking questions like:

Why aren’t we talking about an international sanitation crisis that kills a child every twenty seconds, when we could be investing in sustainable solutions that promote health and prosperity?
Why should we accept a world that makes us feel guilty for doing something everyone does, when we could be creating one that is hospitable to our whole bodies and their needs?
Why is our worth measured solely by how much we consume, when the “waste” we flush into our drinking water could be fertilizing our fields and fueling our cities?
Give A $h*t
The POOP Project has been accepted to premiere a new one-man show, Eat $h*t: How Our Waste Can Save the World, at the prestigious Edinburgh International Fringe Festival in August 2012. It’s an opportunity to reach over 1,500 audience members, plus thousands more who unwittingly step in our $h*t while attending. WTE Theatre has signed on to produce, and we’re partnering with the World Toilet Organization, Rose George, author of The Big Necessity, and others to bring sanitation center stage at the world’s largest arts festival. But first we need to get there.
By funding this show, you will be exposing a critical, unseen issue to a diverse audience with the power to spread this message around the world. A premiere in this distinguished festival offers us access to international media, reviews and audience buzz that can help catapult the show's reach well past August 2011. By December, you could Eat $h*t in a town near you!
Your contri-poo-tions will help us cover our a$$. The more the merrier!

<h3>Play Synopsis </h3>
<p><span>With the decolonisation of Cyprus in 1960 came the democratisation of property-ownership, albeit with<em> a slight risk</em>. Yet, half a century after the last gasps of the British Empire, the Englishman’s house is still his castle, at home or away. Set in Kerynia during the three days of the 2004 Anan referendum in Cyprus a <em>Slight Risk</em> examines the latent conflicts camouflaged in the psyches of an apparently trouble-free British couple that moved to Northern Cyprus to spend the rest of their lives in a place <em>by the sea and under the sun.</em></span></p>
<p>This acutely researched play exposes the strong ties of the English with their home and property-ownership. Bursting open the clichés of the moneyed, tanned middle-aged, ex-pat <em>A Slight Risk</em> unravels the exploitative relationships and the politics hiding in the brick and mortar of a house in the northern part of Cyprus forcing not only a change of address, but a crumbling demolition of desires and expectations. And whereas the immediate cracks are caused by an unexpected visit, human rights violations and Cyprus-problem politics, the echoes of <em>A Slight Risk</em> register the contemporary tremors of the revenging financial disasters.</p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The play is inpired by the infamous Orams case: </p>
<p>In 1974, Meletios Apostolides, an architect, was displaced with his family from his property in Lapithos as a result of the partition of Cyprus which followed a Greek Cypriot coup and the subsequent Turkish invasion of Cyprus.</p>
<p>In 2002, David Charles and Linda Elizabeth Orams, from Hove, Sussex, England, invested £160,000 of their retirement fund to acquire the land from a third party and to construct a villa on the premises. The third party claimed to have acquired the property from the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC), a <em>de facto</em> state which, to this day, has not been recognised by any state except the Republic of Turkey. The Orams used the property in Northern Cyprus for vacations and maintained a separate property in the UK.</p>
<p>In 2003, the <em>de facto</em> administration of Northern Cyprus eased crossing restrictions along the ceasefire line giving the opportunity to displaced Cypriots to visit their old properties. Meletios Apostolides visited his property and confirmed the construction of the house occupied by the Orams. He then sued the Orams (represented in the English courts by Cherie Blair) and won the case.</p>

<p>The show is called <em>SPACE CAPTAIN: Captain of Space!</em> It's running late August-mid September at the Kraine Theater in NYC, with shows at 8:00 p.m. on August 30 &amp; 31 and September 1, 6, 7, 13, 14, &amp; 15.</p>
<p>No Tea's shows have been growing in size and scope since we started, and this is our biggest and funnest (yes, funnest!) show yet. <em>SPACE CAPTAIN</em> is set in the world of adventure stories from the 1930's like Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers, and the show is a mash-up of live performance, film, and puppetry. The story takes place on three different planets and an asteroid, and the performers include human actors, alien puppets, miniature spaceships, and a cat. Plus, the entire thing (including the live portions) is completely black and white. So we're facing some massive production costs--but we think it will be worth it.</p>
<h2><strong>Why Would I Want To Donate?</strong></h2>
<p>We've never asked for help before; we've always funded everything out of our own pockets, because we love working with our amazing company members and we think producing good, original, independent comedy is important and worth it. We always hope to break even, but as many indie theater producers know, it just doesn't happen. Any fully-produced play is expensive, and for shows that only run for 3 weeks in a small space, it is basically impossible to even come close to recouping the production costs.</p>
<p>You will be supporting us, you'll be supporting off-off-Broadway theater, but more importantly, you'll be supporting good original comedy, and we think that's worth paying for. We hope you do too.</p>
<h2><strong>Okay, What Exactly Am I Paying For?</strong></h2>
<p>Rising costs for rehearsal and performance spaces are our main expenses. We also need funds for the set, costumes, and props (and because this is a sci-fi period piece, those costs are considerable), as well as one day of filming in a greenscreen studio. We are hoping for $2500 to offset our losses. That is only a portion of what we'll actually spend on the show, but it will be enough to: (1) help us not go bankrupt, and (2) ensure that the stage won't be bare and the actors won't be naked.</p>
<h2><strong>And What Do I Get?</strong></h2>
<p>You get the smug sense of satisfaction and importance that only results from supporting independent theater! You can also get the cool stuff listed in the Perks section, on the side of the page there. You might walk away with a really awesome ship model, or even a T-SHIRT!</p>

And we've built almost all of it ourselves, thanks to you! We continue to do a DIY show that is all-ages and free to the public, even as costs increase.

She's been teaching class to forest creatures, rocks, and shrubs, all the while scrawling inscrutable symbols on the trees. What dark plans does she have?!

HELL RIGHT</p><p>Some of the cool things your donations have let us do include:</p><ul>
<li><p>Cooling. We don't want the heat of summer to discourage people from engaging in Party Violence.  We've got a new plan that will CRUSH the humidity and heat - we're retooling our space for maximum airflow! Part of our plan includes installing is a huge, $700 fan. Our new cooling plan will draw a lot of power, as well, so we're going to get a generator to make sure our electrical system is protected.</p></li>
<li><p>Art and design. We have an extremely talented team of designers who transform the venue into an art piece by using garbage. 4th Tap was turned into a PLUSH DINOTOPIA by their selfless, capable hands. The HAUNTED MEGAFOREST they're building will suck you into the world of SLAMHAIN! Though most of our resources are scavenged from trash bins and thrift stores, filling a venue of our size with cool decorations—and the storage to keep them preserved show after show!—costs money.</p></li>
<li><p>Safe space/security: PWR is a party for everyone. Our performers have always followed anti-sexist/homophobic/transphobic/racist guidelines, and we wanted to make sure that comfort extends to our audience. We’re proud of our security phone line. Any member of the audience may use this number to report gross behavior at the show, and we resolve the problem, no questions asked. Your support lets us keep reaching toward a goal of ULTIMATE PARTY VIOLENCE for everyone.</p></li>
<li><p>Paying artists. We work hard to make sure everyone who contributes to our production gets some money in exchange—whether our art team, our powerful tech wizards, or our A/V crew.</p></li>
<li><p>Projection and lighting. This might be a dark forest, but you'll see everything with crystal-clarity! PWR has some of the most advanced lighting for an independent wrestling show in the country! And we built it ourselves, with your help. We still have improvements to make; you'll notice and love our latest generation of lights! Our projection system allows people to watch the show from 3 different places in the venue, each with different sitting and standing options!</p></li>

<h2>Our Play’s The Thing</h2>
<p>is a concentrated two-week, community-based theater program which offers older adults age 60 and up who live in Queens the opportunity to create an original 30 to 40 minute play. The inspiration for the play will be a physical object such as flowers, keys, or shoes. The group will investigate their associations to the object through activities like storytelling, improvisation and reflection to create scenes which incorporate the object as a thematic motif.  No prior theater experience is needed to participate. The project will culminate in a public performance held in the multi-purpose common room at Young Israel of Forest Hills Senior League in Forest Hills on Thursday, August 9 at 1:00 PM.</p>
<h3>The program will support older adults to:</h3>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>increase their social engagement  </li>
<li>acquire a sense of mastery of theater through sequential arts activities</li>
<li>promote both physical and mental health</li>
<li>stimulate enhanced memory by using a physical object as a tactile entry point</li>

<h3>About Creative Aging</h3>
<div>Creative Aging approaches aging in a new way. Rather than viewing the older years as a time of steady decline and deterioration, the new paradigm of creative aging reveals these years to be a time of discovery, integration, and growth. Older adults who engage in lifelong learning in a social setting have been shown to experience a powerful sense of mastery through acquiring new skills. This sense contributes to wellness by decreasing depression and slowing cognitive decline.  Gene Cohen’s landmark study, The Creativity and Aging Study: The Impact of Professionally Conducted Cultural Programs on Older Adults, found that when older adults enrolled in participatory arts programs at three different geographical sites in the United States were compared to a control group, they reported “(A) better health, fewer doctor visits, and less medication usage; (B) more positive responses on the mental health measures; (C) more involvement in overall activities.”</div></div>","Our Play’s The Thing
is a concentrated two-week, community-based theater program which offers older adults age 60 and up who live in Queens the opportunity to create an original 30 to 40 minute play. The inspiration for the play will be a physical object such as flowers, keys, or shoes. The group will investigate their associations to the object through activities like storytelling, improvisation and reflection to create scenes which incorporate the object as a thematic motif.  No prior theater experience is needed to participate. The project will culminate in a public performance held in the multi-purpose common room at Young Israel of Forest Hills Senior League in Forest Hills on Thursday, August 9 at 1:00 PM.
The program will support older adults to:



increase their social engagement  
acquire a sense of mastery of theater through sequential arts activities
promote both physical and mental health
stimulate enhanced memory by using a physical object as a tactile entry point
develop their critical thinking skills as they reflect on their work-in-progress.

What We Need and What You Get:
The program is offered free of charge to seniors 60 and up. Your support will enable us to cover the cost of:

Workshop supplies: paper, pencils, pens, markers, etc.

<p>Hi! My name is Cara Maltz and it's actually true – my mom is a sex therapist! As you can imagine my childhood was a bit unusual at best and downright embarrassing at worst, like when I was in fifth grade and my mom was the featured speaker at Career Day...</p>
<p></p>This memory along with many others gave me a wealth of material to use as an artist. I am now a New York based actress, singer, dancer, writer, producer, and the real life inspiration behind the one-woman musical My Mom is a Sex Therapist.<p></p>

We developed different versions of the show featuring an original title song by Keith Varney as well as various covers, and were invited to perform in several festivals and venues.

We went on a wild goose chase for the right composer and lyricist and found both in <a href=""http://www.joshuahcohen.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Joshua H. Cohen</a>.

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-size: 14.0pt;""><b>What is Thrill The World
Kigali?</b></span></p><p></p></span><p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Thrill The World is a world wide dance event in which groups
of Zombies dance Michael Jackson’s iconic “Thriller” Choreography to raise
money for charity, promote dance, spread love and joy to the community and
honor the Humanitarian and Artistic efforts of Michael Jackson. All of this and
an attempt to break the world record for largest simultaneous dance, which is
currently held by Thrill The World!</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">It began in 2006 in Toronto, Canada and has now spread to 6
continents including Africa for the very first time this year! Each group
hosting an event pays money to register, which goes to Thrill The World’s
charity of choice. Each group then has the option to raise money for a charity
of their choice. I have chosen a local children’s traditional dance group
called: Inkondo Z’incamihigo (Small but Strong!)</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""font-weight: bold;""> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/98045/files/20130926130122-IMG_1862.JPG?1380225682"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

event?</b></span></p><p></p></span><p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">I met a local young man named Gilbert Rutaremara through a
connection from Santa Barbara, when I was here with World Dance.  Gilbert is an orphan from the Genocide
and has supported himself through his gift and talent for dance. He has been a
member of the National Ballet for many years but is now in school to study
Information Technology thanks to support from a family in the US. Gilbert teaches
traditional dance to a group of 25 local boys and girls in Kacyiru called:
Inkondo Z’incamihigo (Small but Strong!)</p>
<h3>Meet Gilbert:</h3>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/97921/files/20130926120707-IMG_1598.JPG?1380222427"" src="""" style=""width: 315.13870541611624px; height: 420px;""/></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">(Gilbert receiving the first 1000 RWF from practice sessions!)</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Gilbert has a deep passion for dance and sees it as an
important skill that has helped him survive. He feels that he can offer the
same opportunity to the children in Kigali by sharing his gift with them. He
began this dance group by going out into the streets in Kacyiru and dancing
with whoever was drawn to him, this slowly evolved into a group that is ever
expanding and shifting. He offers himself to anyone who is in need and who
wants to begin to learn a skill that will help them to help themselves in their
future.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The group practices 2-3 times a week wherever they can,
usually in the middle of a broken down building and they perform at Hotels,
Weddings and anywhere else they can.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Gilbert and I share the same ideals, to offer our skills as
a support not as a way of helping them directly, there by offering
opportunities to learn to help themselves reach their potential. We believe
that fostering self-reliance through providing tools is the best way to build
confidence and trust in oneself.</p>

money support?</b></span></p><p></p><p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">All the money raised through the dance practice sessions,
fundraising and donations will go to the group to help them with whatever they need
to keep them dancing. Some of the members have no parents, no home and no
support while others have families, schooling and support systems. The money
will be given to Gilbert for him to manage according to the needs of the group.
Some examples of how the money will be used include: food, water, rent,
clothing, school fees, dance practice space rental fees, costume rentals for
performances.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">For example: US Dollars</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">1 semester of school cost $35 (3 semesters per school year)</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">$1.50 can buy lunch or dinner for one person</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">$50 can pay rent for 1 month</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">$1 can buy a bunch of bananas</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">$2 can buy<span style="""">  </span>4
mangos</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">$5 can buy a pair of shoes<span style="""">       </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">I witnessed the group process last week when I gave them
5000 RWF ($7.60 US) from the money already raised. They talked amongst
themselves and came to an agreement as to who needed it the most in that moment
and it was given out accordingly. My intention is not to impose any ideals onto
the group. I feel that managing of the funds is also an important tool for
learning. That being said, if we raise a large sum I will offer my knowledge of
basic finances like how to open a bank account or find someone for Gilbert to
be in communication with regarding money management. Gilbert will be in charge
of financial distribution. </p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 14.0pt;""><b>Why is this event
important for Rwanda?</b></span></p><p></p><p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">This event connects Rwanda to the entire world through the
spirit of dance, love and joy, which I believe to be incredibly important to
healing. It also brings awareness to the potential beyond the borders of Africa
or even of the sector that they live in. The children know that it was a group
in California that introduced me to the event and the reason I am here all the
way from Canada. They have the opportunity to work with someone from another
country, which makes it possible for them to believe that there is more out
there than what they experience in their daily lives. It is a fact that they
are part of a world wide event and are working with an international
organization, which is an opportunity that a lot of children here may not
experience or believe that they can be a part of. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">This is the first year that Africa is involved in this event

<p class=""MsoNormal"">My name is Amanda Emsland and I am from Canada. Nearly 3 ½
years ago I began a personal healing journey. I moved to an Ashram and began
intensely studying Yoga as a way to heal myself from a nervous breakdown,
Fibromyalgia, Major Depression, Bi Polar II disorder, extreme physical pain to the point of being unable to walk, failure to thrive (stopped eating), suicidal ideations and so much more. I did this
for nearly 2 years and am now healthier than ever before. Through this
experience I began to see life symbolically and I now use Michael Jackson as one
of the main symbols to help guide me in my life.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">In 2012, I followed many signs leading me to California. One
day I was flipping through the paper and saw an ad for Thrill The World Santa
Barbara, there he was and this was my first step towards coming to Rwanda. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The event was being hosted by a local dance group called
“World Dance for Humanity.” It was with this dance group that I came to Rwanda
in June, 2013 to meet the co-operatives members that we send all of our class
fees and fundraising efforts to as support. The rest of the members left and I
stayed behind not fully knowing what I was here to do but I knew I needed to
stay and continue to follow my heart. After a few weeks it became clear I was
here to host this event.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">After participating in Thrill The World Santa Barbara I
committed to hosting the event every year, wherever I happen to be living, so
this year it is Kigali City! My intention is to have it continue on after my
departure and I have made some great connections that will help make that
possible but can always use a helping hand if anyone is interested. It is my
goal to spread this event to as many different communities as I can because of
the impact it had on my own life. I believe it has the potential to make real
change. My next stop is Northern Manitoba, Canada!</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The changes I have made to my life in order to heal are
extreme and include selling all of my belongings, giving up my home, ending my
engagement, quitting my career as a Registered Nurse, living on Faith and
following my heart. Because of this I came to Rwanda with just enough money to
last a few months and have nothing to go back to. I am here offering myself
fully to the people and believe that what I am doing is having just as positive
an impact on their lives as is does on mine. I am currently living off of my
Visa and on a very tight budget. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">I am hosting this event on my own, which is no easy task
seeing as I knew only 1 person when I came and had to find dancers and teach
them the dance, find practice space, advertise, market, promote, organize, find
a venue, learn to use social media, and so much more, all in a foreign country
with a huge language barrier! I am only saying all of this to emphasize my need
for support. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">I have set up my own campaign on which you can support my
journey here in Rwanda. I am the reason the event
is here, I am what will make it come together, I am holding all of the
potential for this to be a great success and without a host there is no event.
Please help me make this an event that can change the lives of a few wonderful
and deserving children. </p>

Kigali?
Thrill The World is a world wide dance event in which groups
of Zombies dance Michael Jackson’s iconic “Thriller” Choreography to raise
money for charity, promote dance, spread love and joy to the community and
honor the Humanitarian and Artistic efforts of Michael Jackson. All of this and
an attempt to break the world record for largest simultaneous dance, which is
currently held by Thrill The World!
 

It began in 2006 in Toronto, Canada and has now spread to 6
continents including Africa for the very first time this year! Each group
hosting an event pays money to register, which goes to Thrill The World’s
charity of choice. Each group then has the option to raise money for a charity
of their choice. I have chosen a local children’s traditional dance group
called: Inkondo Z’incamihigo (Small but Strong!)
 


 

Who will benefit from the
event?
I met a local young man named Gilbert Rutaremara through a
connection from Santa Barbara, when I was here with World Dance.  Gilbert is an orphan from the Genocide
and has supported himself through his gift and talent for dance. He has been a
member of the National Ballet for many years but is now in school to study
Information Technology thanks to support from a family in the US. Gilbert teaches
traditional dance to a group of 25 local boys and girls in Kacyiru called:
Inkondo Z’incamihigo (Small but Strong!)
Meet Gilbert:

(Gilbert receiving the first 1000 RWF from practice sessions!)


Gilbert has a deep passion for dance and sees it as an
important skill that has helped him survive. He feels that he can offer the
same opportunity to the children in Kigali by sharing his gift with them. He
began this dance group by going out into the streets in Kacyiru and dancing
with whoever was drawn to him, this slowly evolved into a group that is ever
expanding and shifting. He offers himself to anyone who is in need and who
wants to begin to learn a skill that will help them to help themselves in their
future.
The group practices 2-3 times a week wherever they can,
usually in the middle of a broken down building and they perform at Hotels,
Weddings and anywhere else they can.
Gilbert and I share the same ideals, to offer our skills as
a support not as a way of helping them directly, there by offering
opportunities to learn to help themselves reach their potential. We believe
that fostering self-reliance through providing tools is the best way to build
confidence and trust in oneself.

What will the fundraising
money support?
All the money raised through the dance practice sessions,
fundraising and donations will go to the group to help them with whatever they need
to keep them dancing. Some of the members have no parents, no home and no
support while others have families, schooling and support systems. The money
will be given to Gilbert for him to manage according to the needs of the group.
Some examples of how the money will be used include: food, water, rent,
clothing, school fees, dance practice space rental fees, costume rentals for
performances.
 

For example: US Dollars
1 semester of school cost $35 (3 semesters per school year)
$1.50 can buy lunch or dinner for one person
$50 can pay rent for 1 month
$1 can buy a bunch of bananas
$2 can buy  4
mangos
$5 can buy a pair of shoes       
 

I witnessed the group process last week when I gave them
5000 RWF ($7.60 US) from the money already raised. They talked amongst
themselves and came to an agreement as to who needed it the most in that moment
and it was given out accordingly. My intention is not to impose any ideals onto
the group. I feel that managing of the funds is also an important tool for
learning. That being said, if we raise a large sum I will offer my knowledge of
basic finances like how to open a bank account or find someone for Gilbert to
be in communication with regarding money management. Gilbert will be in charge
of financial distribution. 
 

 
Why is this event
important for Rwanda?
 

This event connects Rwanda to the entire world through the
spirit of dance, love and joy, which I believe to be incredibly important to
healing. It also brings awareness to the potential beyond the borders of Africa
or even of the sector that they live in. The children know that it was a group
in California that introduced me to the event and the reason I am here all the
way from Canada. They have the opportunity to work with someone from another
country, which makes it possible for them to believe that there is more out
there than what they experience in their daily lives. It is a fact that they
are part of a world wide event and are working with an international
organization, which is an opportunity that a lot of children here may not
experience or believe that they can be a part of. 
This is the first year that Africa is involved in this event
and I feel very honored to be able to introduce such a wonderful tool to this
continent and this country. Let’s keep it going!
 

Why is this event
important for the community?
 

Watching the faces of the children I dance with light up at
even just the mention of Michael Jackson demonstrates to me that this work is
having an impact in a positive way. The simple act of sharing a moment of joy
and happiness can leave lasting imprints in our hearts and minds and if that is
all that it does than it is enough. 
 

 
What is the message you
want to send by hosting this event?
My hope is that the spirit of Michael Jackson is conveyed
through hosting this event. I am a huge fan and fully believe in his message of
Love and giving back to others. I believe in following our hearts and using our
natural talents to make change in the world. I would love for the kids involved
to witness what they are capable of achieving when they commit to helping
themselves. They are making changes in their lives by accepting the gifts that
present themselves, however small. This fosters a belief in themselves, which
will build on their self-worth and self-esteem. This event has the potential to
change the course of their lives by changing their view of themselves and their
place in the world.

<p>This is a new play written by the vibrantly talented Mark Alan Lee. It tells the
story of our protagonist, the loveable affable, Charlie a recent newlywed who
just lost the love of his life, the vivacious effervescent, Anna. Consequently
Charlie is overcome with grief and suffers severe depression. As Charlie
spirals further and further into depression he slips farther away from reality.
The Life Of The Party follows Charlie as he fights with the good and bad
voices in his head, represented by two other worldy creatures, Salus and
Lues who both have their own agenda and are equally determined to
persuade Charlie to follow their path. The story is set in Charlie’s memories,
the audience watch as he tries to focus on what is reality and what is
imagination. Captured with physical theatre performances and iambic
language Charlie fights and contemplates life and the meaning of it all. Is love
enough, to help Charlie overcome his demons, you'll have to come and find
out. </p>

I am one of the eight seniors from the University of South Dakota theatre department that was selected to go to the New York City Senior Showcase. The Senior Showcase is an opportunity to go to New York City and attend and participate in workshops, learn from industry professionals working in theatre, and audition for agents, casting directors, and other industry professionals to help us get started in our theatre careers. Many students from the past have made connections and even gotten jobs from this experience. This is a great opportunity for us, but we cannot do it without your help. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need </h3> <p>The cost for this trip is quite large which is why we are starting early for this campaign. It breaks down to roughly $1300 per person and there are eight of us. We are applying for a grant that will hopefully bring some of that cost down for us. We also are planning other fundraising events such as cabarets and other performance based projects. The money that we raise will go directly to us, the students. Whatever we come up with will go into our University of South Dakota accounts so that we can use that money to pay for the trip. All of the fundraising money we make will be distributed evenly between the eight of us. Any amount of money that you are willing to donate to us will be extremely helpful and we are grateful for it. </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Many of the students that attend the showcase get a great jumpstart to their careers. Some have received representation from agents, and most people get a callback with an agent. This is also a wonderful learning opportunity for us. We will get to participate in a slew of workshops where we will get first-hand experience with working theatre professionals. Kendra Vernon, a 2013 USD musical theatre graduate said of the showcase ""Participating in the New York Showcase literally changed the trajectory of my career. Showcase connected me with my current agent, who has been an invaluable resource to me since I moved to New York City."" Patrick Beasley, a 2012 USD musical theatre graduate said: ""The workshops were an invaluable part of the experience! Receiving feedback, critique, and training from industry professionals gave us great insight on industry standards.""</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>The eight of us would like to thank you for taking the time to look at our page and read about what we are doing. We also appreciate that you are helping to support the theatre community as a whole! </p>

The Senior Showcase is an opportunity to go to New York City and attend and participate in workshops, learn from industry professionals working in theatre, and audition for agents, casting directors, and other industry professionals to help us get started in our theatre careers. Many students from the past have made connections and even gotten jobs from this experience. This is a great opportunity for us, but we cannot do it without your help.    What We Need  The cost for this trip is quite large which is why we are starting early for this campaign. It breaks down to roughly $1300 per person and there are eight of us. We are applying for a grant that will hopefully bring some of that cost down for us. We also are planning other fundraising events such as cabarets and other performance based projects. The money that we raise will go directly to us, the students. Whatever we come up with will go into our University of South Dakota accounts so that we can use that money to pay for the trip. All of the fundraising money we make will be distributed evenly between the eight of us. Any amount of money that you are willing to donate to us will be extremely helpful and we are grateful for it. 
    The Impact Many of the students that attend the showcase get a great jumpstart to their careers. Some have received representation from agents, and most people get a callback with an agent. This is also a wonderful learning opportunity for us. We will get to participate in a slew of workshops where we will get first-hand experience with working theatre professionals. Kendra Vernon, a 2013 USD musical theatre graduate said of the showcase ""Participating in the New York Showcase literally changed the trajectory of my career. Showcase connected me with my current agent, who has been an invaluable resource to me since I moved to New York City."" Patrick Beasley, a 2012 USD musical theatre graduate said: ""The workshops were an invaluable part of the experience! Receiving feedback, critique, and training from industry professionals gave us great insight on industry standards.""

Other Ways You Can Help The eight of us would like to thank you for taking the time to look at our page and read about what we are doing. We also appreciate that you are helping to support the theatre community as a whole!

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p><b>A Very Lupe Xmas</b> is a Live, Theatrical, Holiday Extravaganza brought to you by the award-winning company, <i>Fault Line Theatre</i>.  In the show, a South American immigrant with a heart of gold tries to put on a traditional holiday party, by hiring actors to portray the Wise Men to her Virgin Mary.  When the Wise Men take liberties with the script, and add their own cultural flair, Lupe loses it and fires each and every one of them.  So what happens in Act Two? Can Lupe continue without the Wise Men? Is the holiday season ruined? Or will it be A Very Lupe Xmas after all?  The show is an interactive party where the audiences gets treats (Timbits!), sings along to the Boney M medley, and is asked to help save the show.  We've produced the show on a smaller scale twice before to sold-out audiences, and now we want to make it bigger, bolder and more bawdy! </p>

creation...infectiously
likeable and a clear phenomenon...I was particularly struck by the light
touch of the satire
and by the work’s big vulnerable heart.

Summary
The Cake Shop Theater Company was founded by Katie Lupica and Casey Hayes-Deats to produce new works, forgotten texts, and reimagined classics that give an uncensored voice to characters and creators coming of age - particularly women. Martin Crimp's new English version of Bruckner's Pains of Youth speaks directly to our mission. Set in 1920s Vienna, Pains of Youth tells the story of medical students coming of age in a post-WWI world they did not intend to inherit. Much like young Americans today, they are struggling to find their way in a socially, economically, and politically changed landscape. (Think Girls meets The Great Gatsby.) Crimp's version of Bruckner's breakout drama premiered at London's National Theatre in 2009 but has yet to see the New York stage. After a 3-month-long effort to secure the rights to produce the premiere, The Cake Shop is delighted to be sharing not only a phenomenal script but also the story, language, and ideas unique to two extraordinary non-American writers rarely produced in the US.  This production is an opportunity to bring a terrific play to the right audience at the right time, and an opportunity to professionally showcase a talented group of emerging artists and theater-makers consisting of 1 director, 7 actors, 1 dramaturge,  1 stage manager, 4 designers,  4 creative producers, and others. With your help we will be able to make our production the very best that it can be. Your contribution will make a significant difference in the careers of emerging artists as well as significantly contribute to the vitality of the New York theater-scene. What We NeedIt costs a lot of money to independently produce a play. Here is a glimpse at some of our expenses: $6,090 - Venue Rental; $1,525 - Design Materials; $3,000 - Rehearsal Space Rental; $4,000 - Artist Salaries; $1,200 - Programs and Marketing Materials. We are committed to opening Pains of Youth on February 15th, and we guarantee that every dollar raised from this campaign will go towards our production. The show will go on, but with the funds from this campaign we will be able to compensate all artists for their countless hours of work; we will be able to grant our set and costume designers full creative freedom; and we will be able to fully market the show and attract professional critics. By joining our campaign you will be part of taking our production from bare bones to the professional level we are aiming for.If we meet our fundraising goal, we will be able to fully execute our plans for this production. If we do not meet our goal, we will move ahead while making necessary sacrifices.What You GetIn addition to the perks listed to the right, we also invite you to join our community. We will offer you many opportunities to meet our team and celebrate what we are able to create together. This is an opportunity to support a talented and ambitious group dedicated to bringing high-quality, relevant, and innovative theater to life. We have the skills to produce a wonderfully vital production, and you will have the satisfaction of knowing that you played a critical role in this project's success. *Please note that the Special Opening Night Performance will be Saturday, February 15th at 8pm.Other Ways You Can HelpIf you are unable to donate at this time, you can help us in the following ways:

<p><b>The Synopsis</b></p>
<p>Like the TV show it parodies, <i>The O.C.: The Musical</i> follows the bad boy with a heart of gold, Ryan Atwood, as he faces the trials and tribulations of growing up, falling in love and learning to live in the cut-throat, over-privileged world of Orange County (O.C.).</p>
<p>Growing up on the wrong side the tracks surrounded by alcoholic parents and car-stealing thugs lands Ryan in juvie after a split moment’s decision to cover for his brother turns sour. Luckily for Ryan, his Public Defender, Sandy Cohen, sees the good in him and brings him to live with his family in Newport, Orange County. Soon after arriving in the O.C., Ryan develops a lasting bromance with Sandy’s son Seth Cohen, becomes enamoured with girl-next-door Marissa Cooper, gets in a fight with the popular water polo jocks at school, and becomes the target of sexy widower Julie Cooper’s vengeful hatred as she tries to stamp out threats to her privileged life in the O.C. As tensions rise to an action-packed climax, the characters learn how to express their teenage angst, accept each other’s differences, and get away with murder(?). <i>The O.C. The Musical</i> is a coming of age story like you’ve never seen it before.</p>
<p><b>The O.C.: The Musical History</b></p>
<p>Few could have predicated the popularity and cultural influence the hit primetime drama, <i>The O.C.,</i> would achieve when it premiered on FOX in 2004. In just 4 seasons, <i>The O.C.</i> developed a large, cult-like following that still re-watch and talk about the show to this day.</p>
<p>Stewart Yu and Angela Wong began writing the unauthorized musical parody of <i>The O.C</i>. in April 2014 after discussions for their mutual love of the show developed into a reflection on how ridiculous the Primetime teen soap opera actually was. <i>The O.C.</i> seemed <i>made</i> to be parodied. As they began to layout the story, think of songs to develop characters and workshop their ideas with friends, <i>The O.C.: The Musical</i> quickly formed into the 90-minute musical that was later accepted by the Vancouver Fringe Festival as a 2015 BYOV artist.</p>
<p>With your help, <b><i>The O.C.: The Musical</i></b> will make its world premiere on September 11<sup>th</sup> at 10:15 pm at the Firehall Arts Centre in the Vancouver Fringe Festival!</p>

I was first introduced to dance at the age of three and I have been dancing ever since. Since then I have been involved in many performing arts programs, including studying dance and theatre for twelve years at Dekalb school of the Arts. Last year I got invited by the dance department at The College of Wooster to study dance and theatre in India. The trip is on December 27th, and we will be there for three weeks. In this time I will be studying ""The Natyasastra"" which is a combination of dance,theatre, and music. Please help me so that I can take my passion for dance and the arts to the next level.</div>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>My dream is to share my passion for dance and the arts with others through performance and teaching. As a child/teenager, dance became a outlet for emotions and feelings. Often times I felt as if I could not talk about certain things, but through music and dance I was allowed to leave my emotions on the dance floor. Now as a young woman I hope to use my dance to tell stories through my body that literally change others lives or that at least leaves a person feeling happy. I want to bring real issues to the dance floor. I want to dance about love, pain, faith, passion and anything that means something to someone. I will no longer dance just to dance, or act just to act. I will use my talent, my body, and my voice to change the world.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Cafe Extraordinaire is the latest project by Champaign-based Psychic Joker Entertainment. All performers ourselves, we wanted an accessible place for local talent be able to come and play. We also wanted to create a comfortable late-night gathering place with plenty of entertainment choices all night long.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Psychic Joker Entertainment was created in the spring of 2009 by Lisa &amp; Jason Cerezo and Jace Hoppes. Our goal is to give local audiences the opportunity to create and experience unique choices in entertainment. We prefer to give our own personal focus to the art of magic, but all are welcome on our stage!</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Cafe Extraordinaire will play a part in the continuing growth and revitalization of not only the local performing arts community but also the economics of downtown Champaign. The city of Champaign recognizes the community need for an intimate, accessible performance space for entertainers who don't fit as well in a larger theater or a bar or pub. Cafe Extraordinaire would offer an 80-seat venue complemented by built-in food and beverage service, and would also re-purpose one of the unused buildings in the downtown Champaign area.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Ideally, we would like to network with local performance groups who need a place to call ""home"". Combining our efforts, both in volunteers and in resources, can only help us all reach our goals faster.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This funding campaign is geared toward simply getting the ball rolling on our final dream project. We have a unique and specific vision of a beautiful space that can be open nearly around the clock, where unique entertainment might be discovered at any moment. We also envision a full-service cafe where we can introduce our customers to beverages and culinary delights from around the globe. But for now, we want to get those doors  open and get that stage set.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>By spring of 2011, we plan to secure our building and begin the design of our space. The environment won't be quite as glamorous as we envision in our final result, but it will be comfortable and inviting. We might start out with pour-it-yourself coffee blends so you'll have something to enjoy while taking in our entertainment offerings, while eventually we'll be able to offer a variety of coffee and tea beverages and specialty food items. We might be open only on occasion to start out--when we have entertainers scheduled--but we look forward to being open each and every night. We will continue to look for donors after this campaign ends, as well as put our own money into the project to see it succeed. In the meantime, we're looking for seed money to at least get the doors open.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Remember, the power of networks is every bit as important as the power of cash. Someone out there knows someone else who has the desire and the ability to help us bring this project to its full completion.

<p>Raas is an Indian cultural dance
originating from the state of Gujarat. It is a high energy dance that is done
in pairs with sticks called ‘dandiya.’ While following the beat of the music,
performers use these dandiya and their bodies to put on a fascinating
performance for huge audiences. This performance helps summarize why the Indian
culture is so beautiful and allows teammates from diverse backgrounds to
promote its widespread exposure. </p>
<p>GatoRaas is a national collegiate
dance team that competes throughout the Fall and Spring in Florida and around
the country. The team was founded in the early 2000’s and began competing in
the National Raas circuit during the 2006-2007 season. In 2010, GatoRaas placed
1st at the national bid competition, Miami Mayhem, propelling them into
nationals that year to win the Raas All-Stars National Championship. Our team
is striving to find our way back to nationals this year and we need as much help
as we can get.</p>
<p>This season, we are travelling to various competitions, both
in-state and out-of-state, and thus funds are required to help us compete with
other national teams. These funds are important to us as a dance team so that
we can display our cultural diversity within a reasonable cost.</p>

<h3>2. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">What's the purpose of this campaign?</span>
</h3> <p></p>
<p>Shook
 Ones is in the process of building our first evening-length production 
and we can't do it without the support of our extended family.  We are 
hoping to raise $15,000 through the campaign, though we've only listed a
 $10,000 goal; this is because the good folks at Indiegogo will take a 
larger percentage of our donations if we fail to reach our stated goal. 
 So we’re playing it safe, though we encourage you not to! We're 
extremely fortunate to have an anonymous donor who will kick off our 
campaign by matching all funds up to $1,000 before <span>December 31st</span>.  That means if you donate before <span>December 31st</span>, your donation will automatically be doubled, up to $1,000!</p>
<p>We
 have already received a huge amount of support from the<a href=""http://www.laguardiaperformingarts.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> LaGuardia Performing Arts Center.</a> They’re providing us with both a creation 
residency and a technical residency, as well as two work-in-progress 
showings at the end of May.  In order to make this all happen, however, 
we still need to transport, house, and compensate our primary 
collaborator, Crazy Smooth. We also need your help to support the rest 
of our incredible team of artists: our lighting/set designer, our 
composer/DJ,  our poet/MC, and so on. You’ll notice all those slashes; 
that's because everyone involved in <i>Sorry </i>is wearing multiple 
hats in order to create this ambitious piece in as resourceful a way as 
possible! Finally, we need donations to help us purchase projection 
equipment, costumes, and set pieces in order to bring our vision to 
life.  We just received word that our fiscal sponsorship through 
<a href=""https://www.fracturedatlas.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fractured Atlas</a> has been approved, so <b>your donation is now officially tax deductible</b>.  It takes a village to raise a child, and <i>Sorry</i> is definitely our baby, so please consider showing your support!</p>

<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>3.  What's <i>Sorry</i> about?</h3> <p></p>
<p><i>Sorry</i>
 is about two artists from vastly different walks of life -- both 
culturally and stylistically -- who find common ground in dance. Through their shared passion for movement, education and 
social justice, a deep bond grows between them. They're soon forced, 
however, to confront their differences head on, and to acknowledge that 
no matter how little they themselves make of what they look like or 
where they come from, these things continue to exert an influence on 
their lives. The other half of our exploration will connect the dancers’
 story to a larger population of Americans who experience discrimination
 or privilege based on their race, sex, or economic status. We’ll engage
 this broader discussion throughout, using live spoken word and video 
projection to reflect, enhance, and expand upon our lovers’ story as it 
unfolds.</p>
<p><i>Sorry</i>
 is a tale of good intentions and missed opportunities. It's a story of 
love, hustle music, and the transformative power of forgiveness.</p>

The rest of the budget is secured through grants, event sponsorship, our Grandstand and our Annual Parade Showcase that happened March 30th. 

Of the $25,000 goal, $9,000 will be allocated towards the Marketing, Publicity and Production of the Dance Parade. We will provide sound and parade floats for our Grand Marshals.
Another $8,000 will cover critical insurance and production expenses for DanceFest on 4 stages in Tompkins Square Park.  

A final $8,000 will go towards paying 12 teaching artists to bring dance to Schools, Community and Senior Centers in under-served communities.
The remainder of our budget is secured through grants, event sponsorship and our Annual Dance Parade Showcase scheduled for March 30 2014.

<h3>Destination Dance: a site-specific dance tour through downtown Reno</h3>
<p>Site-specific dance is work that is created in response to a particular place or site, inspired by its architecture, design, history, or current use. Destination Dance will feature the work of local choreographers who have been commissioned to create unique performances juxtaposed against iconic downtown fixtures, taking traditional and contemporary dance off of the stage and into a new environment.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We are raising $3,000.00 to supplement the pay for the 30 local dancers who will be performing in the event. This free event is part of the Artown festival and will be seen by up to 400 people in our community. If we don't reach the entire goal, the funds will still be divided up amongst the performers.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Reshaping the Conventional Notions of Performance</h3>
<p>This project aims to embrace the avant-garde ethos of the July festival, demonstrate the talent of our local emerging artists, and attract an audience that is not accustomed to viewing modern dance.</p>
<p>On Thursday, July 12, tour guides will lead groups departing from the Reno City Plaza at 6:00pm, 6:20pm, 6:40pm, and 7:00pm. They will be equipped to discuss the history behind the various sites and the inspiration behind each artist’s choreographic decisions.</p>
<p>The event is free to the public, and people will be welcome to join the tour for as many stops as they choose. The tour is a 1 mile loop and will take 1 hour to complete.</p>
<p>Featuring urban and natural sites located in the Riverwalk/Arts District in downtown Reno, this walking-distance dance tour will allow audience members to engage with dance in a whole new way and view some of Reno’s most treasured locations in a new and invigorating light. Utilizing signature monuments in the heart of Reno, Destination Dance will celebrate our city’s unique sense of place through movement.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

</h3><p>College changes people, and living alone gives us insight into our souls.  While living alone in a tiny, Molly-sized studio and pursuing my degree in photography, I've found myself suffering from depression and anxiety problems.  While they most definitely begin to occur in most people in their 20s, the common denominator for me was that I had to basically give up theatre (something I'd been doing non-stop for a decade) to work on an art form that relies on a different kind of creativity.  I constantly crave doing theatre and my soul feeds off of naturally-occuring clowning in daily life, and the euphoria of occasional swing dancing.  I have a dark sense of regret lingering in the back of my mind, worried that if I get stuck in this business-oriented world, I may never have another theatrical outlet.  Or I'll never know if I truly need theatre in my life.  This month-long workshop will give me a push in a direction that might have a light to guide me.  Currently, it is dark and confusing, and all I crave is physical theatre and fear the loss of missing this chance.  The training I have already done in physical theatre has made me into a better human, and I can feel that.  The way that I move and react to my surroundings has changed ever since I was called to the world of being barefoot, wearing a red nose, and creating something awesome from nothing.  The training Dell'Arte offers will absolutely aid me in the ""real world"" and give me proper discipline in the areas of creativity that I need.  Dell'Arte teaches ensemble training, as well as learning how to make something from within yourself, and how to properly present it to an audience.  ""Effort, Risk, Momentum, Joy"" are the words of Dell'Arte.  These are all things that I have, but know I will benefit from studying fully.  Dell'Arte will open a world of possibilities for me, and your donations will help me find them.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Need &amp; What I Can Give You</h3><p>I've done the required calculations, and figured out that for the workshop I will need $3,300.  The program is $1250, the housing is $650, and the rest covers the rent for my empty apartment in Sacramento ($675) and food and transportation and indiegogo percentage (~$400).  </p><p>Since I'm graduating so suddenly, I have had no time to save money, especially as a full-time student of one of the most expensive art forms and working a coffee job only 20 hours a week at just above minimum wage.</p><p>While I'm not expecting to raise the full amount, <i>anything</i> will help me.</p><p>I want to give you my love (I have A LOT OF IT) and my art (the possibilities are boundless).  I don't know what the donations will look like just yet, but anything below $100 I will make original art pieces, and beautiful hand-written thank-you cards with calligraphy and rubber stamps.  Anything above $100 I will be happy to give you prints, photoshoots, or discounts on photoshoots.  Let's talk and let's all be happy.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>You're A Starving Artist Too?  Don't Panic!</h3><p>I'm just a girl who wants some clarity.  We've all been there.  Send my link around to your friends.  Everyone can connect and understand the struggle of following dreams.<span><br/></span></p><p>Also, go see theatre.  Ensemble-based physical theatre is consistently changing the theatre world and it allows for new ways for audiences to see the world, and the world within themselves.  Take a friend to see some theatre and get <i>inspired.<span><br/></span></i></p><p><i>art is art is art is art.</i>..</p></div>","What's Going On?I'm Molly Kate, a 23 year-old artist who wants to do so much with my life that I wish I had more limbs.I've been doing theatre since I was ten years old, growing from youth theatre onto Center REP's Young REP intensive summer workshop, to community theatre in the Bay Area.

<h3>Who the heck are ""The Masters of SHX"" and what's this ""Fool's Game"" really about???</h3>
<p>THE TRAGICAL COMICAL FOOL'S GAME is an original devised play created by a group of five MA students who studied Shakespeare &amp; Creativity at The Shakespeare Institute in Stratford-Upon-Avon last year. It was originally performed in May 2017 in The Other Place (the Royal Shakespeare Company's studio theatre space). About an hour in length, the play is (very) loosely based on William Shakespeare's MEASURE FOR MEASURE. Following the character of Bella, an (almost) nun, the play takes us into a modern-day airport bar. Bella is waiting for a delayed flight and sipping tap water while she tries to Google ""online nun classes."" Shenanigans ensue as different Shakespearean characters appear and try to give Bella their two-sense about her tricky situation. But are they really in an airport? Is that man behind the bar really a bartender? Do we control our own fate? Are endings actually the end? Or are they just new beginnings? </p>
<p>This July, The Masters of SHX take THE TRAGICAL COMICAL FOOL'S GAME to the Capital Fringe Festival (relocated to the SW Wharf!) for its US Premiere. With your help, we can bring THE FOOL'S GAME to new audiences in the DC-area!</p>
<p>(Disclaimer: You don't need to love Shakespeare to love THE FOOL'S GAME. This is a NEW play for a NEW world. It's funny, sad, heartfelt, real, and above all else, messy--just like life.)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>We get by with a little help from our friends...</h3>
<p>Good work requires good support. As a company, The Masters of SHX believe that artists deserve to be compensated for their work. While we aren't operating on a Broadway budget, we can't make this show happen for free. Furthermore, we believe in being upfront and honest about where your money will go. Here's the breakdown:</p>
<p>Festival Participant Fee - $585</p>
<p>Festival Insurance Fee - $275</p>
<p>Production Team Salaries (Director, Designers, Stage Manager, &amp; Crew) - $1,150</p>
<p>Actor Salaries (5 actors) - $2,040</p>
<p>Marketing Materials (Merch, website, graphic design, postcards, posters, and programs) - $850</p>
<p>Merch (T-shirts, stickers, and other fun giveaways!) = $200</p>
<p>Sets, Props, and Costumes - $400 </p>
<p>*Any extra $$$ we raise will go straight to the artists!</p>

<h3>Life is hard for a theatre kid...</h3>
<p>We are trying to create an awesome piece of art, but there are challenges. We only have one week to rehearse together as a cast (2 of our cast members have to fly over from the UK, and all of our cast works full-time to support their passion in the arts). We've never produced a festival show before, and live performance is a notoriously hard sell. But we have assembled an incredible and diverse team to tackle these challenges. Our belief is that art makes life better. Theatre teaches us how to better connect, feel, and understand the world around us. If you agree, please consider helping us out!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>For those of us who are not ""rolling in the deep""...</h3>
<p>We get it. Not everyone is flush with cash. Even if you can't contribute financially, we would love it if you could help us by getting the word out! Tell your friends, family, co-workers, and strangers on the street about THE TRAGICAL COMICAL FOOL'S GAME. Indiegogo makes it easy for you to share our project with the world. So don't be shy!

In this short time, we have established ourselves as both an integral member of the theater community on Northwestern’s campus and a quality service organization in the Evanston area. In our first year as a new group on campus with a unique mission we collaborated with the classics student theater group, Lovers &amp; Madmen, to produce Aurand Harris's <em>Robin Goodfellow</em>, an adaptation of <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em>. This production had a weekend of performances on campus, and toured to five schools. Since then we have built our season to include fall, winter, and spring main stage productions, a spring tour reaching hundreds of students throughout the Chicagoland community, and several additional special projects produced throughout the year. Purple Crayon Players is thrilled about how much we have grown in these short six years, and we are constantly trying to think of even more ways to bring quality theatre to young audiences.</p><h3>Mission Statement:</h3><p>The Purple Crayon Players is a student-run theatre company on the Northwestern University campus committed to creating high quality productions, events, and educational materials regarding all aspects of theatre for young audiences. Purple Crayon Players believes that audience of all ages can appreciate, be inspired by, and grow through exposure to this unique art form.</p><p>We produce a mainstage season of professionally written works for young audiences, while also sponsoring high quality outreach events, educational events, and special projects for audiences of all ages both on campus and in the outlying community. These events support the mainstage season, as well as explore other aspects of theatre, community service, and learning.</p><p>Purple Crayon Players feels that making theatre more accessible, in large part through our touring show as well as through events during our season, is a necessary aspect of producing theatre for young audiences. We strive to include diverse opinions, cultures, events, and voices in our season in order to adequately reflect the diverse world that our audiences and artists come from.</p><p>Furthermore, we understand the importance of training the future leaders of the TYA field, and strive to provide Northwestern University students with opportunities to direct, produce, design, perform, teach, and explore new ways of expanding the field both on campus and at large.</p><br/><h3>The Transition of Doodle Pequeño:</h3><p>Doodle Pequeño and his trilingual goat, Valencia (she speaks English, Spanish, and goat) just moved to Southern California. The apartment they share with mama is packed with unopened boxes. With Halloween comes trick-or-treaters and a boy who wears dresses, Reno, like the city in Nevada. Doodle and Reno evade capture from the evil pumpkin-wielding troll, Baumgartner, and out run their nemesis, Marjoram, and her little brother, Toph all while the Santa Anna winds rap at the door. It is a comedic and honest story of two boys who become friends in spite of their differences while examining the consequences of misused language, providing insight into the lives of Mexican-immigrant children and interrogating the issues of gender-identity and homophobic bullying.</p><h3>How you can help:</h3><p>As a completely undergraduate group of students, we have very limited resources at our disposable to put up this incredibly important work. Any help that we can receive in the form of monetary donations will help us continue our efforts to produce high quality, exciting, engaging theatre for young audiences in Evanston.</p><p>Your donation will help tremendously in a variety of ways:</p><ul>
<li>Purchasing lumber, paint, and boxes to construct our set.</li>
<li>Renting sound and lighting equipment.</li>
<li>Obtaining fabric and accessories for costumes.</li>

We strive to include diverse opinions, cultures, events, and voices in our season in order to adequately reflect the diverse world that our audiences and artists come from.Furthermore, we understand the importance of training the future leaders of the TYA field, and strive to provide Northwestern University students with opportunities to direct, produce, design, perform, teach, and explore new ways of expanding the field both on campus and at large.The Transition of Doodle Pequeño:Doodle Pequeño and his trilingual goat, Valencia (she speaks English, Spanish, and goat) just moved to Southern California. The apartment they share with mama is packed with unopened boxes. With Halloween comes trick-or-treaters and a boy who wears dresses, Reno, like the city in Nevada. Doodle and Reno evade capture from the evil pumpkin-wielding troll, Baumgartner, and out run their nemesis, Marjoram, and her little brother, Toph all while the Santa Anna winds rap at the door. It is a comedic and honest story of two boys who become friends in spite of their differences while examining the consequences of misused language, providing insight into the lives of Mexican-immigrant children and interrogating the issues of gender-identity and homophobic bullying.How you can help:As a completely undergraduate group of students, we have very limited resources at our disposable to put up this incredibly important work. Any help that we can receive in the form of monetary donations will help us continue our efforts to produce high quality, exciting, engaging theatre for young audiences in Evanston.Your donation will help tremendously in a variety of ways:
Purchasing lumber, paint, and boxes to construct our set.
Renting sound and lighting equipment.
Obtaining fabric and accessories for costumes.
Collecting props from shops and rental stores.
Publicity efforts as well as marketing in the Northwestern/Evanston and greater Chicago area.
And many other countless programming and production endeavors to help make this show a success!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Edmonton’s newest burlesque theatre company, <strong>Send in the Girls Burlesque </strong>brings the <strong>corset-ripping </strong>story of Henry VIII to the stage Part basement burlesque show, part sexy and scintillating historical thriller, <strong><em>Tudor Queens: A Burlesque </em></strong>marries the art form of burlesque with the medium of theatre to tell the gruesome downfall of six of England’s most legendary queen consorts.</p>
<p>Trapped together in purgatory, the six queens of the house of Tudor are forced to retell their story over and over. As they strip away their royal robes, they strip fact from fiction and slowly piece together their collective existence as wives to the one of the most famous and bloody kings in England’s history.</p>
<p>Made up of Edmonton theatre artists turned burlesque beauties, <strong>Send in the Girls Burlesque </strong>is a collective concerned with matching the performance style of burlesque with the narrative of theatre to create burlesque that tells a story and goes a step above the usual bump and grind.</p>
<p>The 2013 Canoe Festival is an excellent opportunity for us, however we need financial support inorder to bring our show to this festival. Help us launch Tudor Queens beyond fringe.  We want to revamp the script and design elements in order to create an even more incredible show and experience for the audience. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are asking for $2,000 to put into design. Our old costumes from the 2011 Fringe run got pretty shabby and were fairly cheap and our set had to be dismantled in order to save money.  We want to amp up our production values and elevate the look of the show.  The Queens may be dead but that doesn't mean they can't look magical. </p>
<p><strong>Perks: </strong></p>

<p><em>Royal Favour- $25- </em>The queens will send you a commorative photo and declare their gratitude on facebook.</p>
<p><em>Token of the Queen's Affection- </em>$75-  A Hair Flower made by Queen Kitty Howard and of course a harmony of praises on Facebook.</p>

<p><em>“This show hooks you with sex appeal, but then surprises with real, raw emotion, dramatic tension and first-class acting chops. Polished, world-class burlesque it's not.

And while the scantily-clad performers gyrate and demure, what impresses you most is not just their hotness, but their brains behind all the glitter. Now, that's burlesque.

<h3>What are we supporting?</h3>
<p>Off-Strip Productions, an independent non-profit (501c3) theatrical production company, is planning an innovative, in-your-face production of Stephen Sondheim's <em>Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street </em>through the month of October at the <a href=""http://www.onyxtheatre.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Onyx</a>, Las Vegas' premiere arthouse theatre. <a href=""http://www.lvrj.com/neon/onyx-theatre-s-owners-determined-to-bring-back-success-163985786.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">(Check out some recent press from the LV Review Journal)</a></p>
<p>What makes this production so innovative?  Well, we don't want to give too much away, but doing a fully staged version (not a concert) in our intimate 96-seat arthouse theatre will create the parlor musical feel that this show was originally intended to have.  You, the audience, will be among the ghosts of Fleet Street as we unravel this chilling tale together.  This interactive quality will make the show even more terrifying and hilarious - exactly what a musical thriller should be.</p>
</div>
<div><strong>Here at Off-Strip, we are well aware of what a huge venture this is.  That's why we need your help.  This production will jump start the rest of our Affordable Broadway series.  Please join us in creating a new standard, a higher expectation, and an affordable option for local lovers of quality entertainment in Las Vegas. </strong></div>
<div> </div>
<h3>Why $8,000? </h3>
<div>
<p>Off-Strip is heading in a new direction with unique approaches to household names in musical theatre.  We will continue to bring you the cult titles; however, Las Vegas theatre-goers want to see the classics and hits as well.  Shows like <em>Sweeney Todd, Cabaret, and Damn Yankees </em>or more modern Broaday hits like <em>Wild Party, The Last Five Years</em>, and <em>Next to Normal </em>would make for beautiful productions in our intimate space. </p>
<p>But shows like this cost money.  To produce <em>Sweeney Todd</em>, for instance...</p>
<ol>
<li>The rights alone will cost us over $2000 plus book rental fees for a three week run. </li>
<li>Live music is a must for this show.  Professional musicians who make a living in the field will be practically donating their time to help us create the sound this intricate musical requires, but given union stipulations, but they can not do it for free.  </li>
<li>Of course these shows require sets, costumes, and props - roughly $2,000 worth. </li>
<li>And, please, let's not forget about the talented cast and crew.  Actors, designers, builders, and technicians all must take time out of their lives and often other jobs to put in the kind of work required for a professional quality show.  We would like to reward them for their work, and we know you will too. </li>
<li>All of this, plus the cost of advertizing will put us in the &amp;8,000 - $10,000 range for total prduction costs.</li>
</ol>
<p>If we don't raise the goal, the show will go on - Off-Strip's <em>Sweeney Todd</em> is going to be a great production.  But we don't want this venture to end with <em>Sweeney.</em>  With your generous donations, our box office sales can comfortably roll over into the next production, creating an even more stunning and higher quality theatre experience next time, and so on.  Our ticket prices, on the other hand, will remain affordable.</p>
<p>If we go over, even better!  It will all be used for the same purpose - to create professional quality theatre in Las Vegas that is accessible to everyone.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
In addition to creating affordable entertainment, your support of Off-Strip Productions means a stronger theatre community in Las Vegas on the whole.  We often collaborate with other theatre groups in town as well, giving them an opportunity to do those projects that artists love to see, do, and be a part of.  Original works, edgy and unique stagings, workshops: this is how great art is created.  And a thriving theatre offers those opportunies.  By broadening our fan base, we create a wider audience for those up and coming projects as well.  Your contribution will encourage the arts in this diversely talented community.</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
If you can't contribute financially, perhaps there's something you <em>can</em> do.  But everyone has their own unique talents and abilities.  Call us at 702-333-6698 or e-mail us at <a href=""mailto:contact@onyxtheatre.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">contact@onyxtheatre.com</a> for details on more ways you can make this production, this venue, and this community a success.  And thank you!</div>

And, please, let's not forget about the talented cast and crew.  Actors, designers, builders, and technicians all must take time out of their lives and often other jobs to put in the kind of work required for a professional quality show.  We would like to reward them for their work, and we know you will too. 
All of this, plus the cost of advertizing will put us in the &8,000 - $10,000 range for total prduction costs.

If we don't raise the goal, the show will go on - Off-Strip's Sweeney Todd is going to be a great production.  But we don't want this venture to end with Sweeney.  With your generous donations, our box office sales can comfortably roll over into the next production, creating an even more stunning and higher quality theatre experience next time, and so on.  Our ticket prices, on the other hand, will remain affordable.
If we go over, even better!  It will all be used for the same purpose - to create professional quality theatre in Las Vegas that is accessible to everyone.


The Impact
In addition to creating affordable entertainment, your support of Off-Strip Productions means a stronger theatre community in Las Vegas on the whole.  We often collaborate with other theatre groups in town as well, giving them an opportunity to do those projects that artists love to see, do, and be a part of.  Original works, edgy and unique stagings, workshops: this is how great art is created.  And a thriving theatre offers those opportunies.  By broadening our fan base, we create a wider audience for those up and coming projects as well.  Your contribution will encourage the arts in this diversely talented community.

Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't contribute financially, perhaps there's something you can do.  But everyone has their own unique talents and abilities.  Call us at 702-333-6698 or e-mail us at contact@onyxtheatre.com for details on more ways you can make this production, this venue, and this community a success.  And thank you!
