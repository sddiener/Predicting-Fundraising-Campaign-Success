</div></div>","From creating superheroes on
paper, to saving orangutans in real life.

Our international network of creators
across the globe captured the lives and struggles of orangutans in
the medium we know best – COMICS. We used our social media support network
to expose and add focus to the plight of orangutans currently on the
brink of extinction in the wild. 

Our mission is to raise funds
for The Orangutan Project (TOP), the world's foremost
not-for-profit organisation, supporting orangutan conservation, rain-forest
protection, local community partnerships and the rehabilitation and
reintroduction of displaced orangutans back into the wild.
We have spent months coordinating
the creators’ efforts and creating a voice online, and from here, we need
your help!

Headed by Neville Howard
and Alana Bruyn of Melbourne Comics in Australia, we’ve invited
collaborators from across the globe including United States, Canada, Australia,
South Africa and the United Kingdom to submit work to our cause.  To
date, we have 60 creators' work submitted and counting! (All contributors credited at the bottom of this thread)

We’ll be publishing a 32 page
‘floppy’ comic, alongside a more comprehensive 60+
page comic featuring pin-ups
and short stories starring our honoured guests,
the orangutans.





We’d love to change the world. We’d
love to build perfect shelters and reintroduce each and
every orangutan to a safe habitat, but we understand that it all
costs money. As result, we have set
ourselves a modest target: To nurture, educate and support
a single orangutan through the transition back into the wild - $4,000 (after offsetting reward print costs) We did make the project 'flexible funding' as every bit counts and although our ultimate goal is to hit our target, we'd like to ensure every cent goes toward the charity even if we don't get there.
100% of the funds raised will go
toward our target. Do we want to do more? YES, but we can’t do it
alone! Reaching our goal will enable the
release of one orangutan, including monitoring, transportation and caring
during the transition. The sites nominated for release are
Sungai Pengian Station and
Camp Buluh Orangutan Release Site.
What makes our campaign unique is the
blend of original art, prints and stories which makeup the contributions.
Some artists whom work in traditional medium were nice enough to contribute
their original work.

All perks due for delivery Mid to
Late July.Please note Shipping cost: Add 'gift/donation' of $6 Shipping for shipping within Australia, Add 'gift/donation' of $10 Shipping for outside of Australia upon check out.



Q: How can I help?
A:
Donate and/or spread the word of #ProjectOrangutan and #TangoWithOrangos
through social media like Facebook and Twitter.
Q: Can I donate offline?
A:
We’re all about visibility, but if that’s the only way you can donate, we will
happily accept it, and add your donation to the kitty (with the associated
credit and reward as required)
Q: What happens if we don’t raise all
the money?
A:
We’ll keep our goal open ended, so if we don’t meet our target, whatever is
raised will still be collected and donated!
Q: When will I get my perks?
A:
We are currently targeting mid-July to complete all pre-order distributions,
but you will be notified of any delays.
Q: Will any perks go out before the
campaign is completed?
A:
Unfortunately, no.
Q: What if I want more than one perk?
A:
You can make multiple gifts on Indiegogo using a single account. Just make sure
you use the same email address and login, so we’ll know that all of your perks
are meant to go to the same person.
Q: How much is shipping? What if I'm an
international donor?
A:
Shipping is included in the perk price, regardless of your location. If you
would like to offset the cost of international shipping, we welcome additional
gifts of any amount. To do this, simply add an additional gift
amount during your perk purchase/check out.
Q: How will I get my digital download
perk?
A:
By email.
Q: What if I want one of the perks and
it is sold out?
A: We’ll leave
no stone un-turned to help you out, but in some cased items may be limited due
to their uniqueness!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>At WASHED Entertainment, we're building a world of stories. As life-long fans of myths, monsters, and epic stories, we aim to take a new approach at fantasy and sci-fi. We're a generation of story tellers raised on the best movies and comic books and looking to take some of those elements to a new generation. We cater to kids of all ages, and this year, we're publishing four novels and a comic book.</p>
<p>While this campaign is really for the first issue of our comic -- a truly grand retelling of the King Arthur legend inspired by modern stories like <i>Harry Potter</i> and <i>Game of Thrones</i> -- we're also using it to showcase some of WASHED's other offerings in novel format. A great story is a great story, regardless of the media, and if you're here for incredible art, dynamic characters, and a story you won't soon forget, you'll get those in our other books, as well.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The book is already funded and well into development, with items scheduled to ship this summer (barring any other delays out of our control).  The comic book is drawn and designed by artist Grace Holsten. She has given me rough thumbnails of every page of the book and is halfway through the final inks on issue 1. </p>
<p>We're looking for a little extra to pay the colorist. The goal is to give all backers (including the ones from Kickstarter who have already funded the project) to get the best quality product we can make.</p>
<p>Backer rewards range from the comic itself to <i>The Dark Communion</i> novel, written by the same author and taking place in the same world.</p>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The potential risks facing us here are ones beyond our control. As of this writing, our dragon patches are sitting at the manufacturer in Taiwan, unable to ship to the U.S. due to Covid19 restrictions. Our comic printer is in China, and while we've been told that there are no delays at this time, delays could come up.</p>
<p>However, rest assured, you will get your products. Everything will ship to you as soon as we have them on-hand, and the digital rewards will go out as soon as they're available.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you dig the project but just can't contribute at this point, that's okay. We know the world is in a weird state right now and many are hurting financially. But you can still help!</p>
<p>Please consider getting word out! Share with your friends on social media and send them back here to take a look.  Then, once the project is complete, stop by <a href=""http://www.WASHEDentertainment.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.WASHEDentertainment.com</a> where the book will be available after the campaign closes. </p>

<p>Do you like horror? Comics? Gritty, thoughtfully written storylines with deep characters, and beautifully dark illustrations? If so Sharpe Knives will be right up your alley! My name is Anthony Cotter (also known in the music world as AcidBrain) and my friend, underground horror art extraordinaire Martin Trafford, has done an incredible job of illustrating my writing debut! This comic was born from a concept I've been developing for over a decade, and with your help its inception will finally be realized!</p>
<p>We have set an ambitious goal of $2000 for this campaign!

There will also be a digital PDF version of the comic for all contributors! We also have some other cool perks including red on black Sharpe Knives logo t-shirts, signed art post-cards, and for our most generous contributors there will be a few spots for cameos in issue #2 and even the original character sketch Martin did for our main character! A big part of the reason we chose Indiegogo to help raise funds, is even if we don't reach our goal, we'll still be able to use whatever we do raise, to ensure that everyone who contributes gets what they expect!  </p>

<h3>The Who</h3>
<p>Ay there- I'm Curtis, code name 'Cujo'.  I suppose I play the role of new media, podcaster, reporter, and on this collaboration as artist, writer and network profiler.  But the shortest answer is someone who seeks to help independent artists/network alike level up and get paid.</p>

<h3>The 'BL^CK BOOK'</h3>
<p>As media evolves everyday you find yourself at the intersection of how an independent network can build a signal.  That intersection is the 'BL^CK BOOK'.  </p>
<p>This blueprint is a team-up of artists on a book leading to a flashpoint...JOE FEST in Augusta GA, June 21/22.  The book will be a limited print run of 1k leading up to 5.15.19 with the possibility of a bonus run if it catches fire. All artists/podcasters/network involved will get paid every additional printing.</p>
<ul>
<li>1 /$20 2/$50 if two books are purchased- a personal perk tbd.   </li>
<li>Your team up w/ the BL^CK BOOK will get each collaborator a minimum of 2 paydays.</li>
<li>This is a flex campaign, if 5 books are sold, those 5 savvy minds will get them.</li>
<li>Limited run, think Eastman w/ early TMNT books, not saying its that good...not saying its not.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Wanna Team-up?</h3>
<p>Are you G.I. JOE? Do you root for underdogs? The BL^CK BOOK is your dark horse.</p>
<p>Your team up of $20/$50 will bring you into an squad of independent creators assembled to create a culture in one book.  Conversation. An album. All designed to go viral.  But possibly most important is the example of how all fans of the smartest fandom in pop culture, G.I. JOE, can come together to create a signal to support its indie scene.</p>
<p>Personally for me- Its a concept I hope can become a rough blueprint for other creators to improve upon and empower other indies to team-up. In an age where the comics, nay, publication medium is in flux, creatives need to find intuitive partners and a model for all to get compensated.</p>
<p>A percentage of your purchase will go to charity at JOE FEST. </p>
<h3>Experience in the field?</h3>
<p>I do have a successful 'gofundme' campaign under my belt- last year the South African toy podcast 'G.I. Joburg' and I teamed up w/ the JOE community to bring them to JOE CON 2018.  This is a logical next step as it will pay creators in South Africa, UK, Sweden and the good ole U.S. as well.</p>
<p>Not a fan of comics? Get 1. You dig comics? Get 2 - cause you're gonna want to give one to an independent creator.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>MISSION SPECS:</h3>
<p>Details on the BL^CK BOOK are fluid but this campaign is now live- stay tuned to updates for talent in or talking about the book to be revealed during the countdown.</p>
<p>Attendees of JOE FEST in Augusta June 21/22 will def want to team-up as it will enhance the weekend for all involved. details tba</p>
<ul>
<li>40+ pages of surreal colors and military intrigue</li>
<li>regular updates/livestreams on progress leading to the 5.15.19 deadline</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>AFTERMATH</h3>
<p>Your trust and team-up with myself and the BL^CK BOOK would be both humbling and an investment that will not be taken lightly.  I am thankful for all those who have collaborated and will as the pages continue to take shape. </p>
<p>Those attending JOE FEST will pick up their books at a table tbd, while those books being shipped will be sent shortly after / early July. </p>
<p>There really is no downside- I'm invested, there are over 2 years of my line art on these pages, the style ebbs and flows but if you choose to team up on this book, you are in for a hellova ride and also very classy for supporting new creators. cheers.</p>
<h3>Silent but deadly...</h3>
<p>If you take a flyer - no stress. but please feel free to boost the signal, link to a comic reader in your life, or just someone that needs a glimpse of the BL^CK BOOK :)</p>

<h3>What is This About?</h3>
<p>I'm Chris Morris, an independent comic book creator, and my goal is to make great, diverse, and inclusive comics. That pretty much sums up the goal!</p>
<p>I've been reading comics my whole life and have already self-published one book, <i>The Supers: 3rd Best Super-Team in the World #1</i>. Continuing the stories of The Supers in this next comic is very important to me and I hope it becomes important to you as well! I truly think diversity and representation in comic books are of vital importance in 2019 and making this book a reality will help prove that point and make a contribution to diversity in the industry.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why Do This Campaign?</h3>
<p>Truthfully, publishing a comic is neither easy nor affordable. From paying the amazing artists to actually publishing the book, things cost money to do it right and I need your help. The exciting part for you is that you get to participate in the making of a comic book! You get your name in a comic book! You can actually be drawn in as a character in the comic book!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The world has made some great strides in the last few years, but we can always do better.</p>
<ul>

The Supers main story artist: Ricky Gunawan

Keep reading! I'll share my vision with you.
The Local news did a story about my comic book adventures HERE

What is This About?
I'm Chris Morris, an independent comic book creator, and my goal is to make great, diverse, and inclusive comics. That pretty much sums up the goal!
I've been reading comics my whole life and have already self-published one book, The Supers: 3rd Best Super-Team in the World #1. Continuing the stories of The Supers in this next comic is very important to me and I hope it becomes important to you as well! I truly think diversity and representation in comic books are of vital importance in 2019 and making this book a reality will help prove that point and make a contribution to diversity in the industry.

Why Do This Campaign?
Truthfully, publishing a comic is neither easy nor affordable. From paying the amazing artists to actually publishing the book, things cost money to do it right and I need your help. The exciting part for you is that you get to participate in the making of a comic book! You get your name in a comic book! You can actually be drawn in as a character in the comic book!

The Impact
The world has made some great strides in the last few years, but we can always do better.

This comic book contains characters with different body types, of different races, characters who openly identify as LGBTQ, who have differing religious beliefs, who are disabled, who have alopecia, or peanut allergies. I want as many people as possible to find themselves or someone they identify with in the pages of The Supers because comics really are for everyone.
The first comic book I self-published, The Supers: 3rd Best Super-team in the World #1, took six years to finish so I'm hoping with your help #2 won't take quite as long! Less time means the stories, art, and messages can get into your hands as soon as possible.
In my first Indiegogo campaign I had one artist, Ricky Gunawan, who was brave enough to go on the journey with me. Ricky is still involved today and along the way I have added other incredible artists to the team. By contributing to this campaign you can help talented artists continue to make their art and pay their bills.


Risks & Challenges
Why should you trust me with your money and how do you know this isn't something I came up with on a whim? This will be my second crowdfunding campaign. I have learned a lot since that first campaign: all about publishing a comic book, how to work and collaborate with artists, how to talk their language, what a ""bleed"" is, how to get an ISBN number, etc. I'm well-versed in how to make the best use of these funds and deliver on my promises.

<br/>The Story</h3>
<p>An ordinary man named James is living a lackluster life, simply goes through the motions of each day with a frown on his face. This all changes one night when he is attacked on his way home from work, waking up the next morning to find that he has a strange creature bonded to his abdomen.</p>
<p>Soon realizing that this odd being gives him the power to alter his body (among other things), James’ life begins to change from one of monotony to one of excitement, intrigue, and danger as otherworldly creatures start to take an interest in him and his newfound friend.</p>

<h3>The Team</h3>
<p>This is a 2 man team consisting of <strong>Myself</strong> and <strong>Camilo Zepeda</strong>. I am the creator/writer, editor, and publisher of the series. Camilo is the artist, letterer, and colorist on the series.</p>
<p>Even though he is based in Chile and I'm in the United States we complete new pages of work every week, and have done so for going on 3 years now. I find his artwork to quite good, if I may be so bold.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Back it Vs. Selecting a Perk</h3>
<p>When you decide to contribute to the funding of this project (thank you very much for believing in my work!) please be sure to select a perk on the right hand side. If you only click the ""Back it"" button and don't choose a perk then that will be registered by Indiegogo as a donation that doesn't want/expect any perk in return. You can read more details about this in the ""Updates"" section at the top of the page just under the opening video.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I would say the risks are rather minimal. I also keep my word so if you select a perk I can promise you it will get to you. The only thing I will say is that if orders turn out to be really large, and since I would have to do all the shipping myself (or higher some help if enough funds are raised), there might be some delays but I will do my best to limit any long term delays of your orders.</p>
<h3>
<br/>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I know in these tough times not everyone can pitch in financially, and that's okay. If you can't I ask that you share this campaign everywhere that you can. That kind of support is just as important as monetary support and goes a long way :)<br/> </p>
<h3>International Shipping</h3>
<p>For those outside the USA who choose physical items that need to be shipped please be aware that I'll be using a flat rate international shipping box that will add $38 in shipping costs to any of the $20 and up perks you select (sorry.)<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
<p>- At $7000 I'll create variant cover for the graphic novel and a new Perk to go along with it.</p>
<p>- At $10,000 new chibi pins will be created &amp; sent to people who selected the $50 and up Perks.</p>
<p>- At $15,000 new T-shirts will be created &amp; sent to people who selected the $200 and up Perks.</p>
<p>- At $20,000 a concept art book will be created &amp; sent to people who selected the $500 and up Perks.</p>
<p>- Over $20,000 and I'll think of some more cool stuff to create for you!</p>

I'm looking to raise funds so I can combine the 5 issues of my on going comic book series Night Rain into an over 130 page graphic novel. I will also be adding new things like Bonus Art and a new section called The Archaea Files as extras only found in the graphic novel.
Reviews of all my comics can be found on the bottom of the page at: jw-stores.com



The Story
An ordinary man named James is living a lackluster life, simply goes through the motions of each day with a frown on his face. This all changes one night when he is attacked on his way home from work, waking up the next morning to find that he has a strange creature bonded to his abdomen.
Soon realizing that this odd being gives him the power to alter his body (among other things), James’ life begins to change from one of monotony to one of excitement, intrigue, and danger as otherworldly creatures start to take an interest in him and his newfound friend.


 
The Main Characters
James Ash: The person who the story centers around. After a fateful encounter he finds himself bonded to a strange creature that speaks to him in his mind and gives him strange abilities.
 Ted: The strange creature.
He bonds with James to save his life after he is attacked.
Hooded Man: The mysterious figure.
He attacks James without warning, looking down at him silently before he turns around and walks away with out a word.
Emma Wells: The boss's daughter.
She meets James after he saves her from being controlled by a strange creature of her own.
Anthony Peters: The new friend.
He first runs into James when he is asked to train him for his new job at NightLife. The two of them become fast friends.
Deimos: The nemesis.
He hates James and Ted with a passion and does everything he can to make their lives difficult, both in person and behind the scenes.

<h3>Hello!</h3>
<p>My name is Rachel and I am a freelance artist. My partner and I are raising funds to create/publish a series of graphic novels based of the tale of Medusa. This graphic novel is written in modern times from a high school juniors perspective. This comic means a lot to us as it brings to light how awful rape culture and sexual assault is.  </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal is to raise $2,000 </p>
<p>The use of the money will go towards these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being able to cut back from my job to spend 100% of my time on the creation of this comic</li>
<li>Supplies to create the comic</li>
<li>The funds to publish several copies of the end result</li>
</ul>
<p>What you will get in return:</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our biggest risk is not being able to come up with enough funding to support this project thus having to push back the release date.

<h3>ISEULT</h3>
<p>Does that sound like an unusual name? It's from an old legend- ""Tristan and Iseult""; (I also thought it sounded pretty.) Hi there! My name is Peter and I am really new to creating comics- I'm not a pro at all., although I have been collecting them and reading them forever.<br/><br/>Anyhow, I got very interested in drawing and creating a comic last year around August, and thought ""this is the perfect time"" It's a fun story about a teenage girl who discovered she carries the lineage of a powerful clan of werewolves, And further, she even has the ability to learn magic..<i> but she has to learn to control it.</i> She meets another werewolf called Silverclaw and a hamadryad named Daphne,.. and she begins her adventure, struggling to learn her powers, before an inhuman horde called the Scourge destroys her village. As the story progresses, she finds out just how responsible she is as the most powerful person in her village, and eventually she makes a great sacrifice. <br/><br/>All this in 43-pages of black and white comic form!</p>
</div><div>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get<br/><br/>You might be concerned about projects that don't fund and first-time creators, but the good news is my book is finished!</h2>
<p><br/>Yes, I actually completed my entire book before I even started this campaign! So even if we don't fund, I'll figure a way out to get you a book if you really want one. What I'm hoping for here is to generate some goodwill, some name recognition for my next project, and to teach myself how crowd-funding works.  I originally created this comic from a series of 12-page minicomics that I started making back in November. I did 3 ""issues"", while teaching myself how to put together a comic, and I learned a lot along the way. This is just my first work- I am already working on a new series, and there will be more. That said: Here's what you get: </p>
<ul><li><p>You can choose the print version. The digital version, or both. The book is 43 pages, black and white, trade paperback spine. I did the art, writing, layout, etc.. by myself! It ships in a Gemini Mailer, because I am #Comicsgate, and I want you to get my comic in perfect condition. </p></li></ul>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul><li>One thing to be aware of is this is my first comic and it shows! However, I am getting pretty good by the end. Everyone has to start somewhere.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>So, who likes monsters?</p>
<p>I LOVE MONSTERS.</p>
<p> I have loved monsters all my life. As a kid growing up, I would draw monsters and write fun stories about them.  Some would be friendly, others not so much. One thing they had in common, be they good or bad, is that I would try to situate them in a scenario that is more ""human-friendly"" than monster-friendly.</p>
<p>Another childhood love was comic books. I could open one up and become anyone, transported anywhere.  The splash pages, where both pages combined to form one magnificent image, were my favorite.</p>
<p>My childhood doodles and my fond memories of comics is the inspiration for this project.</p>
<p>This is going to be a combination of both monster and comic; a monster comic pin-up.  One page (the left side) will relate a story, while the other page (the right) encapsulates the story in one magnificent image.</p>

I wanted to creative Characters with real diversity. I never took defeat as an option, so I made my own team, garnered my first artist and created Xmoor Studios. With a Live Action Short Based on the Comic book INHERITORS; and a Two time GLYPHs Award winning For Best Female Character: AJALA A SERIES OF ADVENTURES, Co-Created with N STEVEN HARRIS, Xmoor Studios is starting to take wings.

Some of you may actually know me as /u/gayfarang from /r/yaoi on Reddit (if not, hi there, glad to meet you!).</p><p>I've been living in Asia for the past 9 years and one of the complaints I've heard the most from fudanshis or fujoshis living in Europe or in America is how hard it is for them to get their hands on yaoi or shounen-ai merchandise. Many anime shops in the West stock no or very little yaoi merchandise, making it hard for fans to buy the cool products we have in Asia.</p><p>Being in my thirties and having experience in e-commerce, I thought it would be interesting to set up a service that would allow people in the West to get yaoi and shounen-ai merchandise at a reasonable price. This is how the idea of the FUJOBOX (Fujoshi Box, get it?) was born!</p><p>I recently met some people who are extremely familiar with anime suppliers in Japan and we are now ready to launch our business.</p><p>But, to do so, <strong>we need your support!</strong></p><p>Your contributions will go towards:</p><ul>

Hi, my name is Nicolas and I'm a yaoi and shounen-ai fan from Europe. Some of you may actually know me as /u/gayfarang from /r/yaoi on Reddit (if not, hi there, glad to meet you!).I've been living in Asia for the past 9 years and one of the complaints I've heard the most from fudanshis or fujoshis living in Europe or in America is how hard it is for them to get their hands on yaoi or shounen-ai merchandise. Many anime shops in the West stock no or very little yaoi merchandise, making it hard for fans to buy the cool products we have in Asia.Being in my thirties and having experience in e-commerce, I thought it would be interesting to set up a service that would allow people in the West to get yaoi and shounen-ai merchandise at a reasonable price. This is how the idea of the FUJOBOX (Fujoshi Box, get it?) was born!I recently met some people who are extremely familiar with anime suppliers in Japan and we are now ready to launch our business.But, to do so, we need your support!Your contributions will go towards:
Setting up a registered company in Japan.
Buying supplies and inventory.
Setting up a decent website along with an order processing system.
If you're unable to support us at this time, don't worry about it! Sharing our campaign with fellow yaoi fans is just as important, so don't hesitate to click the social media icons to the right and spread the word.Thanks!Our FUJOBOX is a monthly subscription box for yaoi and shounen-ai lovers.The box contains 4 anime goodies, officially licensed from anime or manga publishers, along with a sweet treat from Japan such as Japanese candy, Japan-only chocolate bars, etc...Once our service is live, we plan on offering customers a choice between different plans:
A one-off box with no recurring charges.
A monthly subscription service (1 box per month) that is automatically renewed every 31 or 30 days.
A 3-month subscription package (3 boxes sent on a monthly basis).
A 6-month subscription package (6 boxes sent on a monthly basis).
A 12-month subscription package (12 boxes sent on a monthly basis).
All boxes will be sent by air mail from Japan to any destination in the world. There will be no additional shipping charges regarding of where you live.ANIME GOODIESAs mentioned above, our merchandise will be fully-licensed original merchandise featuring cute or hot anime boys.Types of merchandise:
pencil cases
pillow cases
pens
stationary
bracelets
straps
plastic mats
posters
gachapon balls
... and many, many more!
Basically, we plan on offering everything that is on offer in Tokyo's largest comic shops.Our merchandise will focus on the best and latest anime or manga series, such as:
SUPER LOVERS
FREE!
Junjou Romantica
Black Butler
Love Stage!!
Shounen Maid
SerVamp
If a show has fan service or revolves around cute boys, you can be sure we will include it in one of our boxes!IMPORTANT: To safeguard your privacy, pictures of boys or the words ""yaoi"" or ""shounen-ai"" do not appear on the outside of our boxes.

About 5 years ago I decided that I wanted to be proactive in dealing with my PTSD and through that process The TOI Soldier Project was born.

<p>To allow The TOI Soldier Project to grow I am going to have to hire professionals that can focus on their area of expertise so I can continue to adapt my clients stories to fit into The TOI Soldier Project's universe.

<p>There are a few risks and challenges that I face in making The TOI Soldier Project a valuable platform so Veterans can share their stories; adjusting our methods to accommodate our approach with each PTSD event trigger, difficulties obtaining mainstream marketing team or unknown finaincial costs in hiring other essential company positions.

<p>I understsnd that there are those out there that cannot contribute monitarily but fee that thee are other ways that you can contribute and there is.

If you can help in any way in any of those departments and happen to live in the Los Angeles or California or United States really please contact me.

<p>Even today, our main
intention of raising these funds is to preserve the comic book genre not only
in the South Asian region, but also in the UK where we sell our comic books. In
addition, we plan to further expand our geographic reach to Europe and subsequently
for readers in North America as well.</p>
<p>Our primary aim in
publishing these books: </p>
<p>A) To mainly create stories
in Comics &amp; Graphic Novel Formats based on characters related to the Indian
&amp; Asian mythology. These characters will portray to our readers a large
number of virtues that were considered common during that era, but are looked
upon with amazement and fear in today’s world.</p>
<p>B) Each story will have a moral in it, thus
helping us to teach principles of honor and ethics, for our readers and
entertain them as well. Our research is 100% accurate and backed by a
professional team of professors, archaeologists and researchers. </p>
<p>C) The stories and the characters created by
Vimanika will be brought to life through animated films, live action films,
games, merchandising, toys, theme parks and much more.</p>

 been hardly a couple of days since we launched our campaign and the 
media has already begun its coverage on our campaign to save the comics.
 Animation Express' coverage on our campaignClick on the campaign coverage link above to know more. Read below to know more about us and our campaign. ****************************************************************************Who we are? 
Vimanika Comics is a
Golden Cursor Award Winning Comic Book Company. We are the first Indian company
to create ground-breaking graphics with 100% Indian content in India &
Abroad! Our signature character Karna for The Sixth Series will be showcased
for the first time as a crossover with a vast array established of characters
from around the world in The War of the Worlds series –published by Red Anvil
Comics, U.S. Thus, our comic books and characters transcend geographies and
cultures making them truly universal. As a result, we are also the first Indian
company to launch a graphic novel in the India and the US. 
The founder of the
company is Mr. Karan Vir who started this company primarily to uphold and
propagate the comic book as an art form since it was dying a slow death due to
the advent of other media and art forms. You could check some of the appended links to know more about us as well our stellar reputation in various related events especially Comic Con in India. 
Unveiling of Don: The Origin at Comic Con Express Mumbai '11: A Special Comic Con India Interview with Karan Vir Arora - Publisher, Vimanika: Launch of Shiva: Legends of the Immortal at Comic Con Express Mumbai 2011: Why are we raising funds?  
Even today, our main
intention of raising these funds is to preserve the comic book genre not only
in the South Asian region, but also in the UK where we sell our comic books. In
addition, we plan to further expand our geographic reach to Europe and subsequently
for readers in North America as well.
Our primary aim in
publishing these books: 
A) To mainly create stories
in Comics & Graphic Novel Formats based on characters related to the Indian
& Asian mythology. These characters will portray to our readers a large
number of virtues that were considered common during that era, but are looked
upon with amazement and fear in today’s world.
B) Each story will have a moral in it, thus
helping us to teach principles of honor and ethics, for our readers and
entertain them as well. Our research is 100% accurate and backed by a
professional team of professors, archaeologists and researchers. 
C) The stories and the characters created by
Vimanika will be brought to life through animated films, live action films,
games, merchandising, toys, theme parks and much more.
Vimanika along with its
most creative minds will provide the readers with extraordinary work which will
be cherished by them and the future generations.Snapshots from our Comic BooksPlease check our Image Gallery for more images on a variety of comic book themes from Vimanika Comics.Video PreviewsPlease do sample this video preview section since it will give you a wonderful insight into 'our world.'Shiva-The Legends Of The Immortal-Book I Promo Comic Motion Trailer : Shiva-The Legends Of The Immortal-Book II Promo Comic Motion Trailer : Shiva -The Legends of the Immortal-Book III Promo Comic Motion Trailer: More about our founder

<div>The Big Comedy Gala in aid of Macmillan Cancer Support was set up on 2010 by Barry Church-Woods and Mhari Hetherington and does exactly what it says on the tin.</div>
<div>Over three shows, it's raised over £50,000 for the charity and has attracted Ed Byrne, Roy Walker and The Boy with Tape on his Face as hosts and some of the biggest names in comedy including Sarah Millican, Lee Nelson, Gregg Proops, Sean Hughes, Caroline Rhea, Chris Ramsey, Susan Calman, Frisky and Mannish, East End Cabaret, Vikki Stone, Joe Lycett, Fascinating Aida and many many more.</div>
<div>All donated their time for free to ensure that 100% of the proceeds went to Macmillan.</div>
<div>This year, the event is back and includes an additional daytime gala for children and their families.</div>
<div>Thanks to a very generous partnership with The Edinburgh International Conference Centre, we get the venue for the cost of putting on the lights, but there essential start up costs for this event.</div>
<div>By donating to this fundraising campaign, you'll be helping us raise crucial funds for marketing - an essential element of producing; especially when you have 3500 tickets to shift.</div>
<div>The great thing about this campaign however, is that every donation over £10, gets you a ticket for one of the shows.</div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>So, we need to raise £2500 in the next 30 days.  </p>
<p>In the grand scheme of things, this means selling 139 tickets for the Big Comedy Gala or 250 for the Big Children's Gala - something that we really hope you'll support.</p>
<p>Money raised will cover registration of the event as part of the biggest arts festival in the world, and advertising in the printed programme with a print run of 410,000 copies and an estimated readership of over 1 million.</p>
<p>Registration fee for inclusion in the Fringe Programme</p>
<p>2 adverts in the printed Fringe Programme</p>
<p>Any additional funds will go into the pot for Macmillan.</p>
<p>This is how your donations break down and what you get for your money:</p>

</div></div>","Summary
The Big Comedy Gala in aid of Macmillan Cancer Support was set up on 2010 by Barry Church-Woods and Mhari Hetherington and does exactly what it says on the tin.
Over three shows, it's raised over £50,000 for the charity and has attracted Ed Byrne, Roy Walker and The Boy with Tape on his Face as hosts and some of the biggest names in comedy including Sarah Millican, Lee Nelson, Gregg Proops, Sean Hughes, Caroline Rhea, Chris Ramsey, Susan Calman, Frisky and Mannish, East End Cabaret, Vikki Stone, Joe Lycett, Fascinating Aida and many many more.
All donated their time for free to ensure that 100% of the proceeds went to Macmillan.
This year, the event is back and includes an additional daytime gala for children and their families.
Thanks to a very generous partnership with The Edinburgh International Conference Centre, we get the venue for the cost of putting on the lights, but there essential start up costs for this event.
By donating to this fundraising campaign, you'll be helping us raise crucial funds for marketing - an essential element of producing; especially when you have 3500 tickets to shift.
The great thing about this campaign however, is that every donation over £10, gets you a ticket for one of the shows.   What We Need & What You Get So, we need to raise £2500 in the next 30 days.  
In the grand scheme of things, this means selling 139 tickets for the Big Comedy Gala or 250 for the Big Children's Gala - something that we really hope you'll support.
Money raised will cover registration of the event as part of the biggest arts festival in the world, and advertising in the printed programme with a print run of 410,000 copies and an estimated readership of over 1 million.
Registration fee for inclusion in the Fringe Programme
2 adverts in the printed Fringe Programme
Any additional funds will go into the pot for Macmillan.
This is how your donations break down and what you get for your money:
£5:       A warm fuzzy feeling
£10:  A ticket for the Big Children's Gala in aid of Macmillan Cancer Support
£20: A ticket for either the Big Comedy Gala in aid of Macmillan Cancer     Support or the Big Children's Gala (you decide).
£30: A ticket for your preferred show and a shout out on all of our social media channels
£50: 2 tickets for your preferred show, a shout out on social media channels and a thank you message on the screen before the show
£200: 4 tickets for your preferred show, a shout our on social media channels, a thank you message on the screen before the show, a shout out from the host AND access for 4 to an exclusive VIP drinks reception before the show
£500: 10 tickets for your preferred show, a shout our on social media channels, a thank you message on the screen before the show, a shout out from the host AND access for 10 to an exclusive VIP drinks reception before the show AND a 'supported by' credit on the Edfringe.com show listing
£1000: You really are awesome. So we'll give you 20 tickets for your preferred show, several shout outs on social media channels, a thank you message on the screen before the show, a shout out from the host AND access for 20 to an exclusive VIP drinks reception before the show, a 'supported by' credit on the Edfringe.com show listing AND an exclusive fizz reception at the interval.
£2500:  Using all of the above as options as benchmarks, we'll tailor your experience to suit your needs AND create some additional perks (within reason).
The Impact
 
Right from the moment you’re diagnosed, through your treatment and beyond, Macmillan are a constant source of support to help you feel more in control of your life.
They can help you find answers to questions about your treatment and its effects. They can advise on work and benefits, and are always there for emotional support when things get tough.
Funds raised for Macmillan go straight to their service provision; in fact the £50,000 raised so far by the Big C funded the running of an information centre for 8 months.  That's real, on-the-ground support for people living with cancer and their families.   Risks & Challenges The Fringe is a massively competitive marketplace.  In 2014, there were just under 50,000 unique performances of over 3000 shows.  It's not easy to sell tickets when there's so much on offer.  We didn't stage the Big C last year, but in 2011, 2012 and 2013 we sold out our original capacity and had to move up into bigger spaces.
We did this with a dedicated team of volunteers; all pounding the pavements and a lot of great press.

<b>Hey guys! Listen!</b><br/>
<ul> </ul> </div> <p> Hi everyone! I'm Stephany, more commonly known as Hana Kiyoha or just Hana.
 I'm college student in my early 20s studying Business Magnament, and I am 
raising money to pursue my love of cosplay- designing, creating, and 
wearing costumes. Making costumes is something I have been doing since 
2012, and while I've taken short breaks for school and family reasons, 
I've never stopped loving the work. <br/><br/>I got back into convention 
cosplaying last year and have spent the past year learning new skills, 
improving my craft, and being active in the Venezuelan convention scene. 
Cosplay isn't as expensive as some people make it out to be if you make 
things yourself, but it can still be costly.<br/><br/><b>Why I'm doing this fundraiser</b>:<br/><br/>The
 first and most important is that while I love cosplay and don't ever 
want to give it up, I am the primary financial support for myself, and right now I'm pretty much broke because the unstable economics conditions (read here: <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/francescoppola/2015/01/13/the-impending-collapse-of-venezuela/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/francescoppola/2015...</a>  or just google Venezuelan Economy) . Here in Venezuela the diary salary is less than 1$ dollar and while I work full time I barely make enough to 
pay the bills. Between groceries and paying for school I have been trouble to keep going to conventions. I don't buy things when I go to cons, most
 of the time all I do is work in my friends booths in the conventions and showcase my costumes. But paying for 
hotels and food while 
there can really add up. My family comes first, and I will never choose 
to do something for myself over them, but I really don't want to have to
 give up my passion and talent because of funding.<br/><br/>The second 
reason is that I have a large project I want to undertake for a 
competition this fall, and I need supplies. I don't want expensive stuff
 for the sake of having cool armor, so please don't think that. I have 
certain supplies and tools I need, such as a heat gun and large amounts 
of either craft foam and/or thermoplastics, (that are currently almost impossible to adquire given the economics problem that we have here) that I will need to make the
 armor and costume props. These necessary supplies aren't horribly 
expensive on their own (thermoplastics are a pretty penny but I'm not 
planning to use them for the entire armor, just what's necessary and 
what I can afford) but adding up the cost it will be more expensive than
 anything I've made before. If you need proof, just Google the price of a
 heat gun and a large sheet of Worbla. u.u<br/><br/><b>I love cosplay, making 
props, and competing with my costumes. I really don't want to have to 
stop</b><br/></p><p>The feeling of walking out on a stage in a costume you made 
yourself and hearing that you make people happy because you give life to their favorite characters, regardless of how many, is one of 
the greatest feelings in the world for me. I'd really appreciate just a 
little extra cash to help me keep doing this, as well to continue going to school =)<br/><br/>If this fundraiser sucess I am actually looking in to taking costume 
design and/or prop/makeup classes in the future, so I will be keeping creating more fundraiser even once I've reached goals. You all are what make

some day!</p><p>So, what am I doing if I won't reach our goal? Yush. Cosplay is fun,

<p>Welcome all and thank you for coming to my crowdfunding page! My name is Kamasi Hill, PhD and I'm a historian, theologian, art curator, filmmaker, and a high school teacher for the past 25 years. I specialize in 20th and 21st century American Religious History and Culture and my work explores various themes in African-American History, religion, and popular culture. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1580639627/wtufl7oftcasp0sjs3ff.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I've been a fan of comic books all my life! When I was kid, my parents bought me DC and Marvel comics, but they also bought me Golden Legacy Black History Comics. I was hooked and realized that storytelling and cartoon art/animation could be informative and educational. </p>

<li><p>In ancient West Africa, the keepers of the story earned the title of ""Griot."" </p></li>
<li>I've been a modern day griot, teaching students for over 25 years, and have noticed waning interest in reading. Students are often bored (and rightfully so) with traditional text books, so I decided to create a series of non-fiction graphic novels to help reorient students to the power of literacy and imagination.</li>
<li>The truth is, the way we think is in images and thoughts. We don't remember things as movies or photographs, we remember them as <i><strong>cartoons</strong></i>.</li>

<p>I will be self-publishing the first run of the graphic novel. I will need funds to produce the comics, compensate the illustrator, pay for the digital coloring, publishing, and shipping. </p>

<li>The first in the series will focus on the Great Migration in 4 Acts: I will focus on the ideas, cultural/religious contributions, the political/economic impacts, and highlight the role of unsung sheroes/heroes during the early to mid-20th century. </li>
<li>Humor, vivid images, and short and direct passages will be featured on all 120 pages! </li>

My name is Kamasi Hill, PhD and I'm a historian, theologian, art curator, filmmaker, and a high school teacher for the past 25 years. I specialize in 20th and 21st century American Religious History and Culture and my work explores various themes in African-American History, religion, and popular culture. 
I've been a fan of comic books all my life! When I was kid, my parents bought me DC and Marvel comics, but they also bought me Golden Legacy Black History Comics. I was hooked and realized that storytelling and cartoon art/animation could be informative and educational. 


In college, I decided to major in film and history, I knew that I wanted to be a storyteller. 
In ancient West Africa, the keepers of the story earned the title of ""Griot."" 
I've been a modern day griot, teaching students for over 25 years, and have noticed waning interest in reading. Students are often bored (and rightfully so) with traditional text books, so I decided to create a series of non-fiction graphic novels to help reorient students to the power of literacy and imagination.
The truth is, the way we think is in images and thoughts. We don't remember things as movies or photographs, we remember them as cartoons.


What We Need & What You Get
My goal is to create a series of Graphic Novels that can serve as primary and supplemental learning materials for students and lifelong learners. A Griot's History will be a series of Graphic Novels filled with humor, illustration, and facts about history that you will find no place else!

I will be self-publishing the first run of the graphic novel. I will need funds to produce the comics, compensate the illustrator, pay for the digital coloring, publishing, and shipping. 

Most importantly, your gifts go to help inspire people to read and learn about African-American history and culture in a way that isn't boring or uninspiring. The perks that you can receive include your own copies and merchandise associated with the series depending on your gift.
The first in the series will focus on the Great Migration in 4 Acts: I will focus on the ideas, cultural/religious contributions, the political/economic impacts, and highlight the role of unsung sheroes/heroes during the early to mid-20th century. 
Humor, vivid images, and short and direct passages will be featured on all 120 pages! 

 

This project has one primary goal in mind: to tell the stories of the Black experience to a new generation of readers without boring them to death! 
Ideally, I would love every student in the classroom to have a copy of this series.
I have published articles, written chapters in books, and completed a full length feature documentary film about history! Now it's time to help inspire young adults and lifelong learners through the power of illustration and storytelling.
Your contribution is essential to make that happen! 
100% of your gifts will go to producing and publishing the graphic novel!
If it is successful, I will be able to continue the series beyond the Great Migration.

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>I've been a writer for years, mostly for high school and college. In 2016, a coworker of mine asked for help with her college papers. Her request inspired me to write a short story about my cat, Russell, and I spent a year writing what now has become Russell's first comic book. I owe so much to that friend, but sadly she took her own life. You will see a dedication page for her in Russell's book. The same year I finished Russell's short story, I found my artist UrbanFoxGamer and we have passionately collaborated on this book for almost two years. Alternatively, Russell is not a kid's book, but if you like cats and Deadpool, then this comic book is for you. The characters in Russell like to use colorful language and shoot first and ask questions later. </p>

<h3>THE ART FOR THE BOOK IS 80% FINISHED</h3>

<p>We are starting our goal at $3000 but we want Russell's story to reach everywhere, so we look at the goal as a foundation. Money raised will go to printing.

<h3><i><strong><u>Tales From Neroesville: Issues 1 - 3</u></strong></i></h3>
<p>TFN is a book with no singular star. The city itself serves as the backdrop for our entire universe with different stars and story types in each arc.</p>
<p>Neroesville has the highest population of Heroes of any city in the world. Awesome! It also has the most Villains. Not so awesome. Living here is unlike living anywhere else. Every day is an adventure. Here's hoping you live to tell about it!</p>
<p>Get in on the ground floor with the first 3 issues of Tales From Neroesville! </p>

<p>TALES FROM NEROESVILLE #1: LIGHTNING BALLS (part 1 of 2)</p>
<p>An object of unparalleled power has been located and the criminal kingpin Lord Sinisterio wants it for himself. If he manages to get the object and translate the ancient text, the world will tremble beneath his rule. Neroesville’s greatest heroes have been gathered to thwart Sinisterio and his army. Unfortunately for AirBall and LightningDoug, they didn’t make the cut, but that doesn’t mean they won’t end up right in the middle of the action!</p>

<p>TALES FROM NEROESVILLE #2: LIGHTNING BALLS (part 2 of 2)</p>
<p>While Neroesville’s greatest heroes are in hot pursuit of the object, our lovable losers, AirBall and LightningDoug, find themselves consistently and accidentally one step ahead of them. Meanwhile, Lord Sinisterio is preparing to recite the ancient text and gain omnipotence. Will AirBall and LightningDoug save the day? Better question: will they survive the day?</p>

<p>The art, coloring, lettering, etc is <strong>DONE</strong>.

That's another thing Knuckle Supper Studios offers it's backers.</p>

I started collecting since before I was able to read. Growing up I wanted to be a comic book writer. I've been creating my own characters and writing comic book stories since I was in junior high school. Comic books inspired me to get an art degree. Now I'm a web and graphic designer by trade, and I'm a proud family man with a wife and three kids. I still dream of being an accomplished comic book writer. By supporting this project you are helping to make this dream come true!</p><p>Oscar Choquecota Ale and his team at Bokuman Studios are the artists for the ""Night Wolf"" comic book series. These very talented artists have already started working on issue 2, as you will see some of their amazing artwork here.

I've been creating my own characters and writing comic book stories since I was in junior high school. Comic books inspired me to get an art degree. Now I'm a web and graphic designer by trade, and I'm a proud family man with a wife and three kids. I still dream of being an accomplished comic book writer. By supporting this project you are helping to make this dream come true!Oscar Choquecota Ale and his team at Bokuman Studios are the artists for the ""Night Wolf"" comic book series. These very talented artists have already started working on issue 2, as you will see some of their amazing artwork here. Carlos Herrera contributed to the ""Night Wolf"" project by creating gorgeous character designs, the cover and first four pages of issue #1. Also DC Comics colorist, Ross A. Campbell did the colors for most of issue #1, which is available in print and for digital download.

The Impact

Salt
completes the tale begun with <i>Carbon</i>,
which climaxed as Heat Hatfield rescued the few Eden Hollow citizens who
survived the cataclysmic ignition of the eternal coal sea. In <i>Salt</i>, Heat reluctantly dons the mantle
of messiah to lead his tattered band toward safety—or doom. But where can they
find salvation?

<p>Behind them, the fire
spreads hotter than the world can survive, fueled by the liquefied remains of
Earth’s first civilization—a people cursed by God for not maintaining balance
with the Earth. And as the coal inferno spreads, Nathaniel Golliday and his
zealous lunatic fringe seize the reins of State government in the chaos of a
rapidly accelerating environmental disaster. Golliday declares himself governor
of West Virginia, and vows to subdue all those who would oppose him.</p>
<p>At the grimmest hour, Heat
and his band receive a command from the awakened God: “Go to the Burning
Spring. Make Red Salt.” God’s mystery is both riddle and signpost to the
promised land, and Heat must find the narrow path before twin evils descend on
him and his people and threaten to engulf the earth.</p>
<p>Golliday activates a private
army of underground militias to consolidate his power and eliminate Heat, but
in the meantime, the National Party descends on West Virginia. Their plan? To
eliminate Golliday and quench the inferno by deep drilling the largest fracking
operation in history.</p>
<p>As the clock ticks toward
Earth’s doomsday, the preservation of humankind depends on Heat Hatfield and the

<p>Hello, I'm Vincent Ferrante, chronicler and custodian of the adventures of Witch Hunter. And publisher of Monarch Comics.</p>
<p>Witch Hunter's adventures started when I was eleven, although I was writing, drawing, and stapling together mini-comics since I was about five. That was also the time I realized I was pretty good at the writing, very good at the stapling, but not so very good at the drawing. Fast-forward past potty training, advanced potty training, puberty, a refresher course in potty training, and onto the Creative Writing Program at NYU. I was offered to take part in the program during what would have been the end of my senior year. I accepted, not just because it was a great opportunity and an honor, but because it meant another year of college and the postponement of reality. That is when Jon Redmont, aka Witch Hunter, started letting me in on things about his origin and his purpose which he had previously kept to himself. The Witch Hunter story that I wrote for the NYU Creative Writing program became the basis for the Witch Hunter comic book I eventually would publish after I graduated college...which, in fact, did happen, or so I'm told. (That last year was a lot of fun...and wee bit blurry.)</p>
<p>Anyway, an idea to publish Witch Hunter under a comic book company called Mass Exodus Comics was discarded when someone pointed out the name made it sound like everyone would be running away from me. So I changed the name to Dark Spire Publishing and I published the first Witch Hunter ashcan edition. It was a down-and-dirty version of his first adventure along with some sketches and an editorial welcome to Witch Hunter's new fans, the few that we had, other than my mom. I exhibited that year at an earlier version of the NY Comic Con, with a booth right near DC Comics. After that I began to promote Witch Hunter at other shows in the northeast U.S. while I gained publishing and promotion experience working at entertainment newspapers, magazines, and book publishers.</p>
<p>Then I met Lisa.</p>
<p>For all the people that believed in me, and I'm grateful to say that there were, and are, many...no one believed, and still believes in me more than Lisa. After we got married, she helped me start Monarch Comics and became my editor while I wrote and published issues of Witch Hunter. Which brings us pretty close to the now. I'm very grateful to have business and creative partners like Nicholas Blake Seals, Phil Avelli, Hunter McFalls, Alfred Accettura, Joe Kitchell, and Matt Herring. Through self-promotion, and more than just a little bit of money, we've gotten more than a few people to get to know Monarch Comics and our small, fun line of titles, including <i>Evil Monkey Man</i>, <i>Horror Island</i>, <i>The Last</i>, <i>Monarch Comics Chronicles</i>, and, of course, <i>Witch Hunter</i>, plus novels like <i>Monkey See, Sea Monkey</i>, and non-fiction titles like <i>The Unofficial Doctor Who Companion</i>. As you've likely already guessed, this has all built up to the part where I say that we need help to expand our circulation and grow our business through a crowd-funding campaign. Our plea is in the next, and last, paragraph. I promise.</p>
<p>This campaign is to fund a new print run of Witch Hunter #1, revised and expanded, for the purpose of reaching new fans at this year's New York Comic Con and fulfilling orders through our new website, as well as real stores that you will start to see our titles popping up in. We've included a lot of incentive tiers with lots of ways we're saying thank you for your support. You can never go wrong when you do what you love, and I love Witch Hunter. It's a story of people not believing in magic, or in their own potential, and thereby having that magic stolen from them by others who seek to use its power for their own nefarious purposes...to turn the world into their vision instead of each of ours. It's about the elder races that used to live here, like elves, dwarves, goblins, and dragon folk, who want to take the world back from humanity because we don't appreciate it. It's about evil witches siphoning our magic every time we buy a product, watch any form of media, or vote for one of their candidates, and giving that magic to the elder races to reshape the world into an earlier, pre-human state, after taking a magical cut for themselves, of course. Our hero, Witch Hunter, himself a good witch, attempts to save humanity from the evil witches, and from itself. Using his diverse skill set and a healthy dose of irreverence (which anyone who knows Dean from Supernatural will appreciate) Witch Hunter battles the Scarlet Circle through time, space, and dimension...and when all else fails, he simply blows things up, or sets them on fire, which is what makes comics so cool. That's why our motto at Monarch Comics is ""comic books the way they're supposed to be...fun."" We're very grateful to supporters of our previous campaign for <i>Evil Monkey Man</i>, and hope you see more of what you love in <i>Witch Hunter.</i> If you do, please tell your friends, family, and people on the street to support <i>Witch Hunter</i>, and share the campaign on social media. Thanks for reading.</p>

As you've likely already guessed, this has all built up to the part where I say that we need help to expand our circulation and grow our business through a crowd-funding campaign. Our plea is in the next, and last, paragraph. I promise.
This campaign is to fund a new print run of Witch Hunter #1, revised and expanded, for the purpose of reaching new fans at this year's New York Comic Con and fulfilling orders through our new website, as well as real stores that you will start to see our titles popping up in. We've included a lot of incentive tiers with lots of ways we're saying thank you for your support. You can never go wrong when you do what you love, and I love Witch Hunter. It's a story of people not believing in magic, or in their own potential, and thereby having that magic stolen from them by others who seek to use its power for their own nefarious purposes...to turn the world into their vision instead of each of ours. It's about the elder races that used to live here, like elves, dwarves, goblins, and dragon folk, who want to take the world back from humanity because we don't appreciate it. It's about evil witches siphoning our magic every time we buy a product, watch any form of media, or vote for one of their candidates, and giving that magic to the elder races to reshape the world into an earlier, pre-human state, after taking a magical cut for themselves, of course. Our hero, Witch Hunter, himself a good witch, attempts to save humanity from the evil witches, and from itself. Using his diverse skill set and a healthy dose of irreverence (which anyone who knows Dean from Supernatural will appreciate) Witch Hunter battles the Scarlet Circle through time, space, and dimension...and when all else fails, he simply blows things up, or sets them on fire, which is what makes comics so cool. That's why our motto at Monarch Comics is ""comic books the way they're supposed to be...fun."" We're very grateful to supporters of our previous campaign for Evil Monkey Man, and hope you see more of what you love in Witch Hunter. If you do, please tell your friends, family, and people on the street to support Witch Hunter, and share the campaign on social media. Thanks for reading.",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Hi, everyone! My name is Rachel Roth and I'm the creator/ writer of Bait and Switch: The Comic. I've been writing for years, primarily screen writing that includes original features, pilots, and spec scripts. I'm now venturing into comic book writing with Bait and Switch. Additionally, I'm currently writing a LGBTQ fantasy novel with a friend and we're hoping to get is published on Amazon. </p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">This campaign is to create the very first issue of Bait and Switch: The Comic. This campaign is so that I can pay my incredible team: m</span><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">y artist, Corinne Schipull and my colorist, Erica Ostrowski.  As it stands now, we have the bare bones of the comic. This means that all the thumbnails have been completed and now all that's left is adding meat to the bones i.e. coloring and finalized art. </span></p>
<p>Not only is it for them but it's for me as well. I've been working on Bait and Switch for almost a decade and this is the closest it's ever been to becoming a reality. </p>

<h3>The Project</h3>
</div><div>
<p>For this project we are looking to make $8,000. The money is strictly going to my team. Too many feel that artists should do work for free but being one myself, I know how hard it is to make ends meet. So this indiegogo is for them. At the end of making this full comic, we intend to send it out to publishers and have a real comic that can be sold in stores. The hope is to continue making Bait and Switch: The Comic full time and have it become our full time jobs.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Now, the perks; our goal is to raise $8,000. If you donate to our cause you get early access to our bi-weekly updates. Watch for panels, line art, character sketches, the whole ten yards before anyone else. Next on our list of goodies, you guys will get a  piece of preliminary line art created by our artist, Corinne Schipull. For a little extra you could get one of those preliminary sketches colored by our colorist, Erica Ostrowski.</span><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> Next on our list of amazing things, you can get</span><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> a set of the original thumbnails</span><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> of the comic.</span></p>

<h3>Our Girls: Bait and Switch</h3>
<p>Bait is a Harley Quinn/ Deadpool hybrid. She is energetic and silly. Bait also totally doesn't take the whole 'villain' role seriously despite their thievery. A master of disguise who literally has to change before and during missions in order for them to be successful and to get SOME notoriety as Bait. She also has two other personalities other than the 'Bait' visage. One of her personalities is Grace. She's a four year old who has been trying to take over the vessel of Sabrina for years but has never succeeded. However, now she has a hidden partner willing to help her gain control of the body. Then you have Trucker Dave, a pervy caricature of her late father. He keeps Grace in check and looks out for her. He also has a keen sense of humor and is more adult than the two ladies despite his own perversions. Bait herself, is also a personality. The three combined create their true identity known as Sabrina.  </p>
<p>Switch is a tech genius who creates all her own weapons and ALWAYS forgets to charge them despite what she says about having done so. Her brother was abducted by aliens as a kid and since then her mother has become a hover parent. As she grows older she begins to despise her mother AND gets entangled with the unknown entity, The Nightmare. He begins to blackmail her by telling her that if she doesn't get what he wants, he'll kill her brother with whom he is in possession of.  Switch is down to earth and very serious which compliments her and Bait.  Not only does she have The Nightmare to worry about but her ex-girlfriend who is now a superhero with The Consortium of Heroes. </p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Why ISN'T this project valuable to you and the world?</p>
<p>Let me break it down for you, this comic is about women for women by women (as is says in the video). But it's not just that, it's got a diverse cast of characters representing the LGBTQ community (Switch, for example, is a young Black woman who's ex is a female superhero). But she's not the only one. Later in the comic, we explore the character of Crimson Harbor. She's a trans superhero who used to be the head of the superhero group: The Consortium of Heroes. Not only that but we're shattering body shaming for men and women.  Not all of our characters are stereotypically good looking but are still adored by their fans. Looks don't matter; it's the amount of good you do to help people that makes them a hero or a villain. Along with such, our main character Bait deals with dissociative identity disorder, dealing with the taboo subject of mental disorders. BUT in the comic, SHE IS NOT HER MENTAL DISORDER. She is simply her.  This comic is meant to bring hope to those who don't have it, hope to those who fight everyday for who they are, hope to those who are lost. That's what makes this different than other comics and this is what your money will be helping towards. </p>
<p>In times past, for this particular project I have shot a live action Bait and Switch teaser trailers. I have also had the pleasure of working with the late Stan Lee and Kevin Smith on another project with Legion M.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our primary challenge right now is getting the money to produce said comic. We need to get money for parcel and printing (eventually). </p>
<p>The indiegogo is step one. This enables us to create this as our pitch packet and gets us to a place were we can start pitching it to publishers. </p>

Story by Mohamed El-BisatieA man invented the city of Khaldiya in order to collect the salaries of an imaginary local police force. He produces fake documents and builds the city out of clay in his own home, as a realistic depiction of his own imaginings. He maximizes expense claims by inventing rebellions that need to be crushed by the police - violently, of course.

<p><br/></p>
<p>We are Katie Norris and Sinead Parker and we met seven years ago on the BA Hons Charades (Acting) course at The Manchester Met School of Theatre. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>We discovered we shared a birthday (26th February) and an affinity for nudity, wine and
eighties music which eventually led to us creating our comedy double act….Norris
&amp; Parker. <br/></p>

<div><br/></div>
<div>We write and perform original comedy and this summer we are taking our BRAND NEW show to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>'See You At The Gallows' is a sordid soiree full of wild, dark and ridiculous sketches, characters and songs woven within a narrative of underlying aggression between ourselves.<br/>
</div>
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<p>We're delighted to be performing at the Pleasance Courtyard at the ungodly hour of 10.45pm for the whole of August.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1465318337/draftNP-Gallows-May16_v7_bygfr1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>We’ve been working with the hugely talented actor and musician, Chris
Thomson to create original music for the show. Steve Hall has been brought in to direct. He was one
third of We Are Klang (nominated for the Edinburgh Comedy Award in 2006.) He
directed Pappy’s Comedy Award nominated show in 2007. <br/></p>
<p> As '<i>Norris &amp; Parker</i>' we have written and
performed shows at the Manchester, Camden &amp; Edinburgh Fringe Festivals to
sell out audiences and great reviews.</p>
<p>***** THE SKINNY</p>
<p>***** THE REVIEWS HUB</p>
<p>***** TUSK JOURNAL</p>
<p>***** THE GOOD REVIEW</p>
<p>**** WHATSONSTAGE</p>
<p>**** BROADWAY BABY</p>
<p>Last
year’s show 'All Our Friends Are Dead' was a word of mouth hit at Just The Tonic
at the Caves. Since then we have signed with <i>Christian
Knowles Management</i> who represent various comedy legends like Mickey Flannagan,
Zoe Lyons and Gary Delaney. We've made the big move to London seeking fame,
fortune and reasonably priced rent and have been gigging on the
comedy circuit ever since. <br/></p>

<br/>
<p>We've also had the opportunity to forge creative links with Hull Truck Theatre by becoming Supported Artists and performing All Our Friends Are Dead as part of their theatre programme. </p>
<p>So after an exciting year we're ready to head up to Edinburgh again and to give you an idea of
our costs, here are our open books...</p>
<p><i>Venue Deposit- 420 pounds</i></p>
<p><i>Accomodation- 2500 pounds</i></p>
<p><i>Fringe registration- 295 pounds</i></p>
<p><i>Pleasance Joint Venue Brochure - 600 pounds</i></p>
<p><i>Production Fee - 3000 pounds</i></p>
<p><i>PR - 2500 pounds</i></p>
<p><i>Advertising, Marketing, Publicity - 923 pounds</i></p>
<p><i>Flyer and poster design &amp; printing-  610 pounds</i></p>
<p><i>Flyering team - 840 pounds</i></p>
<p><i>Public Liability Insurance/PRS - 50 pounds</i></p>
<p><i>Costume, Props (Quiche, moustaches and catsuits)- 200 pounds</i></p>
<p><i>Travel and van hire- 300 pounds</i></p>
<p><i>The simple joy of making people laugh - Priceless (lies)</i></p>
<p>We have huge ambitions to move into TV and Radio and believe this years trip to Edinburgh could build upon our growing reputation, cult status and modesty. </p>
<p><i><b>Which is why we're specifically crowd funding for the cost of hiring a PR Manager in order to achieve these ambitions.</b></i><br/></p>
<p>Having PR means drinking espresso martinis in The Groucho Club but more importantly, getting our name out in the press. This includes listings, interviews and reviews in national newspapers and magazines. Already, we can see the difference of having PR and have secured several interviews in some brilliant publications.<br/></p>
<p>We are financing Edinburgh ourselves by working various jobs and abstaining from social activities of any kind. Norris flips crepes and serves babycinos to Shepherds Bush (Chez Bu) yummy mummies. Parker pulls over-priced pints and supervises small children (despite not having a CRB) only joking, she's not a nonce but she is a drunk.</p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>The work we do as Norris &amp; Parker means everything to us as it gives us artistic fulfilment and creative control of our careers. If you are able to donate then <i><b>thank you so much</b></i> as it really will make a difference. </p>
<p>It will mean that Parker can keep her kidneys and Norris can keep her virginity.<br/></p>
<p> If not then thank you for reading and please spread the word about the show!<br/></p>
<p><i>'See You At The Gallows'</i> is on at The Pleasance Courtyard (The Attic) at 10.45pm (3-28th August, except 21st)</p>

<br/><p>Thanks Sinead's Dad, Thanks everyone.</p>

</div></div>","Aloha!


We are Katie Norris and Sinead Parker and we met seven years ago on the BA Hons Charades (Acting) course at The Manchester Met School of Theatre. 

We discovered we shared a birthday (26th February) and an affinity for nudity, wine and
eighties music which eventually led to us creating our comedy double act….Norris
& Parker. 



We write and perform original comedy and this summer we are taking our BRAND NEW show to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. 

'See You At The Gallows' is a sordid soiree full of wild, dark and ridiculous sketches, characters and songs woven within a narrative of underlying aggression between ourselves.


We're delighted to be performing at the Pleasance Courtyard at the ungodly hour of 10.45pm for the whole of August.



We’ve been working with the hugely talented actor and musician, Chris
Thomson to create original music for the show. Steve Hall has been brought in to direct. He was one
third of We Are Klang (nominated for the Edinburgh Comedy Award in 2006.) He
directed Pappy’s Comedy Award nominated show in 2007. 
 As 'Norris & Parker' we have written and
performed shows at the Manchester, Camden & Edinburgh Fringe Festivals to
sell out audiences and great reviews.
***** THE SKINNY
***** THE REVIEWS HUB
***** TUSK JOURNAL
***** THE GOOD REVIEW
**** WHATSONSTAGE
**** BROADWAY BABY
Last
year’s show 'All Our Friends Are Dead' was a word of mouth hit at Just The Tonic
at the Caves. Since then we have signed with Christian
Knowles Management who represent various comedy legends like Mickey Flannagan,
Zoe Lyons and Gary Delaney. We've made the big move to London seeking fame,
fortune and reasonably priced rent and have been gigging on the
comedy circuit ever since. 



We've also had the opportunity to forge creative links with Hull Truck Theatre by becoming Supported Artists and performing All Our Friends Are Dead as part of their theatre programme. 
So after an exciting year we're ready to head up to Edinburgh again and to give you an idea of
our costs, here are our open books...
Venue Deposit- 420 pounds
Accomodation- 2500 pounds
Fringe registration- 295 pounds
Pleasance Joint Venue Brochure - 600 pounds
Production Fee - 3000 pounds
PR - 2500 pounds
Advertising, Marketing, Publicity - 923 pounds
Flyer and poster design & printing-  610 pounds
Flyering team - 840 pounds
Public Liability Insurance/PRS - 50 pounds
Costume, Props (Quiche, moustaches and catsuits)- 200 pounds
Travel and van hire- 300 pounds
The simple joy of making people laugh - Priceless (lies)
We have huge ambitions to move into TV and Radio and believe this years trip to Edinburgh could build upon our growing reputation, cult status and modesty. 
Which is why we're specifically crowd funding for the cost of hiring a PR Manager in order to achieve these ambitions.
Having PR means drinking espresso martinis in The Groucho Club but more importantly, getting our name out in the press. This includes listings, interviews and reviews in national newspapers and magazines. Already, we can see the difference of having PR and have secured several interviews in some brilliant publications.
We are financing Edinburgh ourselves by working various jobs and abstaining from social activities of any kind. Norris flips crepes and serves babycinos to Shepherds Bush (Chez Bu) yummy mummies. Parker pulls over-priced pints and supervises small children (despite not having a CRB) only joking, she's not a nonce but she is a drunk.




The work we do as Norris & Parker means everything to us as it gives us artistic fulfilment and creative control of our careers. If you are able to donate then thank you so much as it really will make a difference. 
It will mean that Parker can keep her kidneys and Norris can keep her virginity.
 If not then thank you for reading and please spread the word about the show!
'See You At The Gallows' is on at The Pleasance Courtyard (The Attic) at 10.45pm (3-28th August, except 21st)
And to leave on an inspirational quote from a great man;
""I didn't get where I was through talent alone, I got there through sheer hard work."" - Charlie Parker 2012


Thanks Sinead's Dad, Thanks everyone.
Loads of love,
Norris & Parker

<p><b>We loved this manuscript</b> from the minute we finished reading the first page! <i>The Adventures of Snider</i> <i>the Spider</i> by renowned author, John Taylor Gatto, is a fabulously funny rhyme about a spider, who is a big dreamer and has a fantastic plan for his life, which includes becoming a CIA spy. The narrative is rich with all the components that make a story great: interesting characters, humor, morals, and life lessons, plus it is a great teacher of language skills, too. The book is also rich with illustrations by internationally acclaimed artist, Anne Yvonne Gilbert. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The major Snider funding we need help with are for the illustrator and publishing costs. The illustrator's fee is $15,000 and the publishing cost will be approximately $15,000. Our goal for this fundraiser is $30,000. The book is approximately 6 X 9 and 150 pages...full of many lively, unforgettable illustrations. </p><p></p>For those unfamiliar with John Taylor Gatto, he was a New York city teacher, who won the New York state teacher's award several times before he wrote an op-ed to the Wall Street Journal titled, ""I Quit, I think."" He did quit because he had discovered, through researching the history of modern education, that schools were not the best place to educate children. John's personal story and his published books are fascinating and known around the world.

<p>Although the <b>“The Roommate”</b> has the ingredients to be an

12 to 39, gamers, comedy fans, and women from 21 to 32 who have an imposter
complex are all there for the taking. Employing a modern electronic-tracking matrix allowed
us to drill down into the meta data (thanks NSA) and discover that the highly desirable
demographic of left handed woman ages 14 1/2 to 15 1/2 have a
propensity for <b>“The Roommate.”</b> We're received positive
antidotal feedback from this group, our core audience, which includes such gems
as “totally,” “for sure,” and “whatever.""</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434742450/ffnax9jhkiljedabcej3.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><u></u></p><p><br/></p>
<p></p></div>","What it is:
“The Roommate” is a comedy web series with 14 episodes ranging
from 7 to 22 minutes in length.Three friends in their twenties, two men and one woman,
share an apartment in Washington, D.C. When they have trouble coming up with the
rent, they hatch a hair-brained scheme to rent out the tiny room off the hallway.
They keep having to find a new
roommate because something always happens and the new roommate never lasts.Shot in glorious 4k Ultra HD, “The Roommate” is a madcap
absurdist comedy that manages to make bizarre sense within its own wacky
universe. Fast paced, with witty repartee, at first glance it appears to be
a quirky romp, but rumbling just beneath the surface is a biting social satire
of the human condition in the age of global warming.  With plenty of dick, puke, and defecation jokes, the “Roommate”
unashamedly goes for the cheap laugh while at the same time ponders the big
questions. If “The Roommate” were candy, it would be bittersweet dark
chocolate on the outside and gooey caramel on the inside. If it were a car, it
would be a Porsche with a speedometer that forces you to drive under sixty, and
if it were a relative, it would be your crazy uncle Louie who thinks he is a chicken. 
Homeland security, Russian spies, a Capitol Hill intern with
a sex blog, mean girls and even zombies make a appearance, proving that it is
far better to have your brains eaten than die in a rising sea tide.
Why We Need Funding:
Until now, I have self funded this project. I starting
filming in August 2013 and have over 75% of “The Roommate” in-the-can,
and edited. But I left the most difficult and most costly scenes until last. I still
have four more days to film and need to be able to pay the actors, location
fees, make-up artists and extras. $10,000 will allow me to complete the filming
and get the 14 episodes, which consist of more than two hours of content, up and available on the Internet. Still to be filmed is a flash forward scene where two of the roommates are married
with a child and have to explain to their child that the zombie apocalypse was created
solely as the result of her mother’s carelessness. The flash forward scenes
will be much funnier if the zombies are on par with their peers from “The Walking
Dead.”  I am fortunate to have on board a make-up artist who worked on that show.  
The Audience:
Although the “The Roommate” has the ingredients to be an
all out sausage-fest, the lead character is a unmistakably strong woman, or will be once she sheds some emotional baggage. Males from
12 to 39, gamers, comedy fans, and women from 21 to 32 who have an imposter
complex are all there for the taking. Employing a modern electronic-tracking matrix allowed
us to drill down into the meta data (thanks NSA) and discover that the highly desirable
demographic of left handed woman ages 14 1/2 to 15 1/2 have a
propensity for “The Roommate.” We're received positive
antidotal feedback from this group, our core audience, which includes such gems
as “totally,” “for sure,” and “whatever.""
The Cast
Working on a small budget meant working quickly, but I didn't compromise on the casting. I had the good fortune of putting
together a talented, young cast that had real chemistry. They made the dialog
believable, and the story fly. 
Alex Vaughn (Corey): I wrote this part for Alex and then he … moved to Hollywood! I flew him back to shoot this and it was worth the extra
expense because when Alex commits, he’s all in and he killed. 
Shayna Blass (Holly): Alex recommended Shayna and she was
the first to read for the part. I know I had my Holly right away, but had
to wait a couple nervous weeks until she committed to the part. Now I can't image
“The Roommate” without her. She portrays vulnerability as well as anybody in the
business and has great comic timing.   Jaben Early (Ray): Although I originally cast someone else in this role, when he dropped out and Jaben stepped in, I knew I was experiencing a stroke of good luck. Jaben played the part differently and better than
what I originally envisioned. I had worked with Jaben before and respected his talent, but had never worked with him on a comedy before. Jaben not only does funny, he does it fearlessly. 
In Conclusion
Funny and definitely weird, “The Roommate” will continue to
surprise you. We can say with certitude that arguably “The Roommate” is the
greatest show never (yet) to have been made in the history of the world, nah, the
universe! 
You may ask “Do you think society owes you a Web
series?” And I could answer that by saying, “Yes, it does.” I am not going to
do that, but, instead, insist that you are framing the question wrong. It should
be “Do you think you owe society a Web series?” Yes, dammit, I do, so please help me

<p>I don't remember the day I picked up a pencil and started scribbling an idea, but it has always been a part of who I am. I love comics so strongly that they have infected my lifestyle.</p>
<p>I can’t deny my love for comics and cartoons! Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Biker Mice from Mars and even the Toxic Crusaders from Troma. All of them were my crown jewels, things that made me laugh and were just so fun!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That’s how <strong>BEAST COMMANDOS</strong> came to be, it’s my tribute to those toys/cartoons that gave me so much joy as a kid. Remember as a kid you’d make up imaginary battles between your toys? This book is all of it brought to life!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Amigo Comics was Beast Commandos’ first home 6 years ago, having the best reception with its first issue. Sadly, the sales weren’t too flattering, as a result it was cancelled before the second issue released. The news hit hard but I decided to accept the outcome and move onto new projects.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Imagine the surprise when I found out the comic was still selling well! Word of mouth spread leading to new fans picking it up. Bookstores were selling out of copies and reviews of my crazy ideas kept coming in. I even started getting job offers due to this, people wanting their books to get the same style as Beast Commandos.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If there was a moment, then it’s now! Beast Commandos has another shot and this crowdfunding campaign will see it through!</p>

</div></div>","Think Sharks are bad ass? Prepare to meet DARK SHARK! A commando who loves his cigars almost as much as his knives! Assigned to take down the nacro Don Walrus, a powerful drug lord with a fondness of guns and an army of brutal mercenaries! Biting off more than he could chew leads to him re-assembling his old crew! FRANCHELICO, the kung-fu disco turtle; RIDER, Rabbit of Anarchy; WOODY, an unclassifiable green dog; and CORPORAL STIFF, the amiable dolphin! Did you miss all the gun-toting grim-and-gritty nonsense from the 90's? This is your book! Guns! Knives! Gritted teeth! Duck shooting!
 



I don't remember the day I picked up a pencil and started scribbling an idea, but it has always been a part of who I am. I love comics so strongly that they have infected my lifestyle.
I can’t deny my love for comics and cartoons! Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Biker Mice from Mars and even the Toxic Crusaders from Troma. All of them were my crown jewels, things that made me laugh and were just so fun!
 
That’s how BEAST COMMANDOS came to be, it’s my tribute to those toys/cartoons that gave me so much joy as a kid. Remember as a kid you’d make up imaginary battles between your toys? This book is all of it brought to life!
 
Amigo Comics was Beast Commandos’ first home 6 years ago, having the best reception with its first issue. Sadly, the sales weren’t too flattering, as a result it was cancelled before the second issue released. The news hit hard but I decided to accept the outcome and move onto new projects.
 
Imagine the surprise when I found out the comic was still selling well! Word of mouth spread leading to new fans picking it up. Bookstores were selling out of copies and reviews of my crazy ideas kept coming in. I even started getting job offers due to this, people wanting their books to get the same style as Beast Commandos.
 
If there was a moment, then it’s now! Beast Commandos has another shot and this crowdfunding campaign will see it through!

Cover by Roger Bonet
 
 

 
In this campaign, I want to bring Beast Commandos back to life with print runs of the first two comics plus extra goodies put in.
 
If successful, I’d have enough to work on a second volume (3 and 4) of the original ideas I intended for the series! It’s all going to provide more and more 90s action love for all!
 
I hope for your help in making this a reality!
Lets do our beast to make this happen!

DARK SHARK is tough, wild, truly a one-shark army! He has spent years on the trail of his nemesis, the fearsome criminal mastermind DON WALRUS. All that hunting was about to pay off as Dark tracked him down to his private estate.
Only to run into the mercs he hired for protection! He was prepared but not for the beating they gave him!
Wounded and humiliated Dark decides to reassemble the BEAST COMMANDOS! The fiercest team the Duck Kong has ever seen! Don Walrus and his Evil Team won’t stand a chance!
The team is made up of:

 
 

Dark Shark:
An elite shark soldier with one goal, to end Don Walrus and his reign of terror! A despot, violent and irascible making him the perfect team leader! He runs off a simple philosophy to life: ""If you don’t succeed with force, it’s cause you lack enough strength""
 

Rider:
 Former member of the Biker Rabbits of Anarchy, kicked out due to his secret passions. He’s been riding solo ever since reminiscing about his days with the Beast Commandos in his solitude.  Faithful to his comrades this is one bunny you’ll always want watching your back!
 

Franchelico:
A Turtle with a jokey attitude, Franchelico joined up with the Kung-fu Disco Turtles to find more purpose in his life. All he got were cruel pranks and a massive headache. Kicked out after a mission gone wrong, he went for the solo vigilante role till Dark Shark came looking for him.
 
Woody:
An unclassifiable green dog that lives in his own little world. He treats life like a constant adventure always wanting another exciting challenge. There is a fiery side to him that even sends chills up Dark Shark’s spine, keep him happy at all costs!
 

Corporal Stiff :

</h3>
<p><b>THE BEGINNING</b><br/>I grew up idolizing fictional characters from comics from Spider-man to Sailor Moon and anything in between. When I was 9 years old, I made my first connection with a <i>Dragon Ball</i> volume. As I read it, and being mind-blown by it at the same time, I knew from this moment what I wanted to do in the future; I wanted to do a manga of my own. I even wanted to be published by Shonen Jump! Talk about being ambitious! I wanted to be noticed by Shonen Jump so I could meet one of my idols, Akira Toriyama, creator of <i>Dragon Ball</i>. If it wasn't for me, I would have never starter writing.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448083739/aatfgpl8iyszzc1fdhos.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><i>I think it would have been as such at Shonen Jump.</i><br/></p>Until 16, I wrote loads of fanfictions. I even mixed characters from <i>Dragon Ball, Digimon, Pokémon</i>, and even <i>Megaman</i> in the mix. (Yeah, I had a crazy imagination.) In high school, I met Hagane and we became great friends due to our love for manga and for having the same aspirations; creating a series of our own. And we've been on it ever since. It was at that time that HEART OF WILDFIRE was born. At the same time, she had given the first breath of life by drawing the characters. </div><div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448131734/usdr0r7bprobo21zlsmx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
</div><div>
<i>I only gave the ideas, but she did the heavy lifting. Yes Hagane, you did! Stop being so modest!</i><br/>
</div><div>
<p>Despite my huge desire to work and publish at Shonen Jump, I realized I was much more immature than I thought. Piercing through this business was hard and harsh, and even more difficult for non-Japanese ones as myself. Learning Japanese alone would have been incredibly time-consuming.</p>
<p>They were times I almost gave up. But I thought to myself, was it really important to reach Shonen Jump. And as stupid as it was, I simply said, ""no."" And just like that, it was as if I needed that simple answer to tear that wall down.</p>
<p>And with the rise of independent self-publishing platforms that came years later, I realized my dream could come true. At last.</p>

</div><div><br/></div></div>","Greetings everyone, my name is Gregory Michel, but some of you out there know me as GM, FallenAngel (for the last time, I don't worship the devil!), etc. And he's our story.

THE BEGINNINGI grew up idolizing fictional characters from comics from Spider-man to Sailor Moon and anything in between. When I was 9 years old, I made my first connection with a Dragon Ball volume. As I read it, and being mind-blown by it at the same time, I knew from this moment what I wanted to do in the future; I wanted to do a manga of my own. I even wanted to be published by Shonen Jump! Talk about being ambitious! I wanted to be noticed by Shonen Jump so I could meet one of my idols, Akira Toriyama, creator of Dragon Ball. If it wasn't for me, I would have never starter writing.


I think it would have been as such at Shonen Jump.Until 16, I wrote loads of fanfictions. I even mixed characters from Dragon Ball, Digimon, Pokémon, and even Megaman in the mix. (Yeah, I had a crazy imagination.) In high school, I met Hagane and we became great friends due to our love for manga and for having the same aspirations; creating a series of our own. And we've been on it ever since. It was at that time that HEART OF WILDFIRE was born. At the same time, she had given the first breath of life by drawing the characters. 



I only gave the ideas, but she did the heavy lifting. Yes Hagane, you did! Stop being so modest!

Despite my huge desire to work and publish at Shonen Jump, I realized I was much more immature than I thought. Piercing through this business was hard and harsh, and even more difficult for non-Japanese ones as myself. Learning Japanese alone would have been incredibly time-consuming.
They were times I almost gave up. But I thought to myself, was it really important to reach Shonen Jump. And as stupid as it was, I simply said, ""no."" And just like that, it was as if I needed that simple answer to tear that wall down.
And with the rise of independent self-publishing platforms that came years later, I realized my dream could come true. At last.
WHAT IS HEART OF WILDFIRE?Heart Of Wildfire tells the story of three brothers, Sahn, Tairo and Ryo Lamarey...




From bottom to top: Sahn, Ryo & Tairo, the Lamarey brothers
...aspiring to become living legends like the late hero Senthann Kameyata who passed away by defeating Shadolus, queen of calamities and goddess of chaos.




The late Senthann Kameiyata


The hero's sacrificial battle...

But the brothers' plan suddenly takes a fateful turn when they stumble on a medallion shaped as a flame: a Heart of Wildfire. 



The medallions; Hearts of Wildfire
Learning that these mysterious artifacts are coveted by the armies of the Sirken Cross, the same forces formerly led by Shadolus, the brotherly trio are engaged on a journey to find the remaining medallions before these hellish forces do and plunge the world of Gaelice into chaos by the hands of their new leader, the enigmatic one called the General.What better way to become a living legend than saving the world?

Le Sang de Dracula est la
première BD d’une trilogie qui s’adresse aux jeunes du primaire de 7 à 12 ans.



Si
on en croit la cinquantaine de jeunes que nous avons sondés, le succès de cette BD est assuré. C'est avec enthousiasme qu'ils
nous ont guidé pour raffiner notre scénario et le rendre encore plus
fantastique.


L’histoire est
collée à la réalité des jeunes d’aujourd’hui.
Tommy est nouveau dans
cette école où trois filles s’amusent à l’asticoter sans raison. Une petite
gang plutôt agressive, ces trois filles, qui s’acharnent à lui faire perdre ses
moyens. 
Josie tente de venir à
son secours et se fait intimider à son tour. Cloé est également nouvelle mais
elle a plein d’idées pour se défendre; ainsi Tommy et Cloé deviennent amis.
C’est le début de l’aventure. 
Dans la famille de Cloé
un grand oncle, le chercheur Origène, s’est toujours intéressé aux
comportements des mammifères, du singe jusqu’à l’homme. Son secret, bien gardé,
est une autre recherche qui porte sur une réalité plus explosive : trouver
des antidotes aux drogues de synthèse qui ravagent les jeunes d’aujourd’hui.
Cette recherche est gardée secrète parce que plusieurs groupes ne souhaitent
pas qu’il réussisse et d’autres organisations veulent s’emparer de ses
découvertes pour mieux les exploiter. 
Plongés, malgré eux,
dans un monde où les enjeux les dépassent largement, comment la gang de Tommy
et Cloé va-t-elle s’en tirer? Une histoire à suivre.


Réaliser
une bande dessinée est un travail  colossal. Une fois le dessin terminé,
il est difficile d’imaginer quelle somme de travail à la chaîne cela a demandé. À partir d’un scénario détaillé incluant les dialogues, un premier
crayonné est réalisé, le plus souvent grossier où il faut placer les

les crayonnés  à l’encre noir. C’est
l’encrage.  Finalement, ultime étape, les planches noir et blanc sont
scannées pour y apposer la couleur et
y insérer les séparations pour l’impression.

Parce que je ne dessine pas
moi-même, je dois m’entourer de plusieurs collaborateurs, trois dessinateurs se
sont succédés pour faire avancer le projet, d’autres viendront sans doute s’y

Où ira l'argent recueilli

Si nous atteignons les $25,000
demandés, une partie de ce montant permettra de terminer les pages de dessins
de la première BD dont le titre est Le Sang de Dracula.


Jusqu’à

Extrait d’un témoignage d’un
jeune rejoint lors du sondage :

Comment pouvez-vous nous aider? 
Aide
essentielle :




Vous pouvez réellement nous aider. Même si dans les contreparties qui suivent, il
est mentionné des montants impressionnants, un $20.00 est une aide
extraordinaire pour nous.
Savez-vous que seulement 1,500 personnes qui accepteraient d’investir
ce $20.00 nous permettraient de dépasser notre objectif.
$20 n’est pas un  montant énorme mais ça va faire une énorme
différence .
Merci de faire ça pour notre projet.


Voici également une aide appréciable :
Chaque personne qui souhaite nous aider peut le faire facilement.
Ce projet de BD a besoin d’être connu. Choisissez parmi vos contacts les personnes les plus susceptibles de nous aider d’une manière ou d’une autre.
Soit parce qu’elles possèdent un très grand nombre de contacts dans leur carnet d’adresses à qui elles peuvent écrire ou qu’elles disposent d’un peu d’argent à investir.
Faites parvenir un message personnel à ces contacts en les dirigeant vers Indiegogo pour leur permettre de connaître Tommy et Cloé.

<p>“Love the way you take everyone’s points of view and split
them up throughout the series… I’m
really excited about this comic book and I really don’t get excited about a lot
of comic books… There are only a handful that I can’t say enough good about and
this is one of them. Everything from splitting everything up to the different
points of view to the artistic design and the overall feel and take on the new
zombie idea. It really does hit home. Where a person could sit back and be
like, ‘dude that’s deep.’ You are doing
a fantastic job with it and quite frankly I can’t wait to get my hands on some
physical issues. Because I want to collect them, bag them and board them, this
is good stuff man... We as readers appreciate a new take on the genre. I want to see something slightly different from
the traditional hack and slash, and this is it.“ <b>Tangent Bound Network</b></p>

<p>“The book is unlike
anything I’ve read before… You’ll find these characters to be a lot more
relatable than other comic book people… Other than the surreal art style and
the relatable characters, <em><span>Only Human</span></em>
also has the one thing everyone loves to hate and hates to love—cliffhangers. I
remember getting to the end of the first issue and instantly feeling that all
too recognizable feeling of “Wait, no! Finish now! Don’t make me wait!” It
seriously got me hooked! All in all, <em>Only
Human</em> is an enticing read, an underdog unfairly buried under the
hype of comic powerhouses Marvel and DC. Well I for one believe that it
deserves to receive the same praise as the comic book stories of The Walking
Dead or any superhero comic! If you don’t believe me, then pick up a copy of <em>Only Human</em> and decide for
yourself!” – <b>MovieFinatic.com</b></p>

Welcome to Only Human. An ongoing Comic Book Series about a
true underdog. 12-year-old Wesley must defeat 7 eternal evils AND save
the world from a New Age Zombie Apocalypse.
Wait!? Don’t like zombies? Don’t worry this is far beyond
just another zombie book. Our zombies are just another character in a much
larger cast.

Because of this, I saw a lot of stuff online that no teenager should ever be exposed to. So, when I was finally handed my college degree, I knew there was only one route to take. I had to use my powers for good.</p><p>Black Gold isn't about forcing a woman into a man's role - or a lesbian into the fray.

Gone are the swoons and corsets and impractical heels. Embrace an adventure that lays siege to issues of gender, race and sexuality while engaging readers in the tale of a captain who always gets her girl.
Black Gold follows the story of Captain Jacqueline DeBeau and the crew of the Siren Queen as they sail the 19th century waters of the Mediterranean raiding merchant ships in the name of fortune and fame. Captain Jaq steers her ship with an iron fist. She demands respect and accepts nothing but utmost loyalty from her men. The crew of the Siren Queen never takes prisoners. Jaq DeBeau disallows the trade of human flesh - either for labor or pleasure - making her the toughest pirate captain to serve under. But when a loot job goes bad, Jaq doesn't command the loyalty she thought she did.   Help us fund a comic and launch a series.This is a follow-up campaign. Our first attempt raised just enough to cover all the concept artwork. Hurdle one? Conquered. Now we're moving into production. Right now, the first issue of Black Gold is set to be a preview comic. It's twenty pages of piratey, actiony goodness that sets up a five act graphic novel and makes you want the rest of the series. Pencils, ink and color is going to run us $840. Lettering is going to be $10 a page. And whatever is left, should we hit our goal, is going toward a first print run and fulfilling perks. So all of the money will be going toward getting the comic finished, produced and printed so everyone can have a copy.Since launching our Indiegogo campaign, we've been blessed to gain a financial investor to the Black Gold crew. The comic is now funded 100%!! This campaign page is now for pre-orders of the comic. Get your copy and join the crew while orders are open! All proceeds of this Indiegogo campaign are going toward a first print run~The Perks

$5 -- Comics for the frugal - or environmentally conscious. Once Black Gold is finished, we'll email you a PDF copy (before anyone gets print copies!).

$20 -- In addition to your advance PDF copy, you're also going to get a color print copy mailed to your home along with a Black Gold post card to thank you for backing our project.
$50 -- If you carry a different bag each day of Comic Con (because each one gets full of goodies), then this perk is for you. Sure, you'll get to pick up a comic (in color, of course), but you'll also get all those goodies. There's no telling what you'll get. But leave us your shirt size. Oh... spoiler.
$500 -- Are you crazy? Oh, good. We like crazy, and this is some crazy support. Back us at this level, and you'll get yourself written into the comic. There's only one perk at this level, so when it's gone, it's gone. But it'll be worth it to see yourself crossing swords with Captain DeBeau. (Comic and swag bag included, of course.)

$2 -- Electronic copy of Black Gold. Get in on the action before anyone else!
$5 -- Grab your print copy of Black Gold before they're no longer available!
$50 -- Swag Bag o' Pirate Booty. And a comic, of course!
   The Goal Being a queer kid of the nineties the only representation of female and LGBT characters in mainstream media I saw was a joke - still is, really. Because of this, I saw a lot of stuff online that no teenager should ever be exposed to. So, when I was finally handed my college degree, I knew there was only one route to take. I had to use my powers for good.Black Gold isn't about forcing a woman into a man's role - or a lesbian into the fray. My goal is to simply give comic readers a great story with the action and adventure (and a hint of romance) they crave - with a protagonist who just so happens to be a lesbian. No token characters - just to say they're there - but characters who are people. Normal people.Because, in the end, Black Gold isn't about nuance or novelty; it's about normalcy.     Other Ways You Can Help SPREAD THE WORDEven if you can't contribute financially, sharing #BlackGoldComic and this campaign with your friends, family and followers can be just as valuable.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Mind Behind WICKED</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>Hello! I'm Ouroboros Moon, Ori for short. I have been writing fiction for years, and as a young pitiful-earth child. I've always conjured up stories filling them with colorful characters in insane worlds, sharing them with anyone, and everyone who would listen and read. Which isn't many people (to be honest). But overtime as I kept at it. I’ve progressed quite a bit in my writing ability, formulating longer and more complex stories. As a now a self-proclaimed writer, anime-enthusiast, manga enthusiast, and even a part-time video game developer. So, I consider myself a professional storyteller! Who is adept at using my imaginative thinking and creative flair to bring my stories to life in engaging and entertaining ways. </p>
<p>WICKED is a project that I've always wanted to publish for years. Currently I wrote a few versions of the story but as time went on the story evolved spawning this unique universe, out of another that was greatly different. Making WICKED's main narrative, a hodgepodge of ideas--that sung a beautiful song of entropy. </p>

<h3>What We Need To Make WICKED A Reality </h3>
<p>We actually have everything needed to make WICKED the best it can be, but we still need your help. It takes money to pay for professional art,. I've run all the numbers and here's the plan...</p>
<p>This funding is crucial to getting WICKED completed and distributed. I've been able to personally fund a portion of the project, but I need your help to bridge the gap. We need to raise a minimum of $2,800 to get this book made and onto your computer screen. Without your contributions, we can't do this. So, in return for your support, you get a piece of WICKED history in the form of one of our perks!</p>

The Mind Behind WICKED
 
Hello! I'm Ouroboros Moon, Ori for short. I have been writing fiction for years, and as a young pitiful-earth child. I've always conjured up stories filling them with colorful characters in insane worlds, sharing them with anyone, and everyone who would listen and read. Which isn't many people (to be honest). But overtime as I kept at it. I’ve progressed quite a bit in my writing ability, formulating longer and more complex stories. As a now a self-proclaimed writer, anime-enthusiast, manga enthusiast, and even a part-time video game developer. So, I consider myself a professional storyteller! Who is adept at using my imaginative thinking and creative flair to bring my stories to life in engaging and entertaining ways. 
WICKED is a project that I've always wanted to publish for years. Currently I wrote a few versions of the story but as time went on the story evolved spawning this unique universe, out of another that was greatly different. Making WICKED's main narrative, a hodgepodge of ideas--that sung a beautiful song of entropy.

What We Need To Make WICKED A Reality 
We actually have everything needed to make WICKED the best it can be, but we still need your help. It takes money to pay for professional art,. I've run all the numbers and here's the plan...
This funding is crucial to getting WICKED completed and distributed. I've been able to personally fund a portion of the project, but I need your help to bridge the gap. We need to raise a minimum of $2,800 to get this book made and onto your computer screen. Without your contributions, we can't do this. So, in return for your support, you get a piece of WICKED history in the form of one of our perks!

During this time all the dark forces battle the forces of light for control of Earth and of the minds of its people.</i></p><p><i>The battle comes down to a one-on-one showdown between proxies, one person chosen by each side, to have their memories wiped clean and their minds filled with a single purpose - to destroy each other.

How can one live without context? Without knowledge of a family and loved ones, even with the powers of a superhero? And, in a twist not predicted by the Gods, what if a sliver of consciousness remains? What if these humans, subjugated to fight each other in the colosseum of the Earth, retain some human feeling? What...if...they fall in love? Will their powers be a gift or a curse? That’s why this battle is unique among a thousand such previous bouts.

<li>Solar eclipse. The sun has gone out.</li>
<li>An odd black smoke is spreading across the desert and the ground has cracked.</li>
<li>Darkness comes and a strong wind picks up.</li>
<li>From the smoke and sand comes a human figure in a long black robe with a large hood pulled up over the head.</li>
<li>Exorcist's face close - I feel the smoke - my eyes do not see well. Who am I? Why am I here?</li>
<li>Light slowly comes back and the wind dies down. ""Why is it so hard to move? What world is this?""</li>
<li>The mysterious figure pulls off the hood and opens the robe. ""I only remember the beam of light, of soaring high above.""</li>
<li>A sexy female body is revealed inside.  ""I saw this planet and I saw the people who were there.""</li>
<li>""My God, I am human??""</li>
<li>The sun shone brighter. ""And light returned to the Earth""</li>
<li>Exorcist screamed in pain. ""My chest burns!""</li>
<li>On her chest a flame ignited, and from this flame came a large gold medallion.</li>
<li>Touching her medallion, as if remembering something - ""I am the Exorcist and must prevail over the darkness that is taking over on Earth. Why did you give me this mission? Why??!!!!""  </li>
<li>She collapses, drained.  </li>
<li>Evening arrives. ""And you shall revel by the sun and by the moon.""</li>
<li>Her eyes open. ""I was not brought back up, I must battle the forces of darkness here on Earth.""</li>
<li>From the sands arise blue bodies of the damned souls.</li>
<li>They all go move the Exorcist, since they were summoned to destroy her. ""We will destroy you!""</li>
<li>She swings her braids ""My first weapon!""</li>
<li>She destroys them one at a time with the scorpion stinger at ends of her braids, until none of them are standing. ""What now, dead fodder? Still think you can destroy me?""</li>
<li>Face close up - ""Anyone else want to be made into mince-meat?""</li>
<li>A thin gold ring appears mid-air and floats toward her ""Am I engaged all of a sudden?  No, I don't think I'm done having fun!""</li>
<li>The gold ring slides onto her finger ""But, if its only a gift, I guess it's ok. Thank you - upstairs!""</li>
<li>An angel, as if summoned, flies to her and stands behind her. ""And if this is a helper and not a groom, I guess I'm cool with it.""</li>
<li>The Exorcist steps up to the angel ""I prefer it up higher""</li>
<li>The angel carries her into the sky ""Fly Heavenly Air - the only way to fly!""</li>
<li>They fly toward a city that appears in the distance. “Back to the city. Maybe I can catch a movie. More fun than up in the sky.”</li>
<li>Dark angels begin to appear in the sky. ""We are the guardians. You are not allowed here.""</li>
<li>Exorcist swings her medallion ""But I have a ticket! How do you like it?""</li>
<li>She spins it around her head and it makes the sound ""VUUUUGAAAAAAAA""</li>
<li>A cross appears on the medallion. ""Be gone in the name of Christ""</li>
<li>The cross starts glowing ""and the dark forces shall fall from the site of the holy""</li>
<li>Dark angels collapse to the ground, screaming.</li>
<li>A second golden ring appears and slides on to her finger ""You know how we girls love gifts! Golden ones most of all. Any diamonds coming?""</li>
<li>Another angel appears and joins her on her journey.</li>
<li>At the edge of the desert we see horns rise from sand ""What in hell?""</li>
<li>A giant human male figure comes out of the sand (big pic) ""Who dares disturb me? A rag doll and a couple of insects?""</li>

During this time all the dark forces battle the forces of light for control of Earth and of the minds of its people.The battle comes down to a one-on-one showdown between proxies, one person chosen by each side, to have their memories wiped clean and their minds filled with a single purpose - to destroy each other. The stakes are simple - the lives, minds, and souls of all mankind. These two people have an everlasting title - the forces of good unite behind The EXORCIST, and the others back SLAVER.This, the last Exorcist, is a girl of twenty years, and her nemesis is a boy of about 25. How can one live without context? Without knowledge of a family and loved ones, even with the powers of a superhero? And, in a twist not predicted by the Gods, what if a sliver of consciousness remains? What if these humans, subjugated to fight each other in the colosseum of the Earth, retain some human feeling? What...if...they fall in love? Will their powers be a gift or a curse? That’s why this battle is unique among a thousand such previous bouts. What happens when emotion meets mission, and calling meets a feeling of … kin?THERE'S STRENGTH IN NUMBERS.THEY CAN'T STOP US - JOIN HER FIGHT!I'm Victoria Unikel, and my life has been spent entirely in ENTERTAINMENT. I planned to release this story of a SUPERHERO and a WORLD with MYSTICAL SUPER POWERS for many years, carrying the character and the story within me. I've also launched many film, music, and fashion projects in Europe, one of which was THE EXORCIST - my industrial metal band.  We had a message to bring to the people - the message was salvation from evil and tyranny. The band was on my journey to getting this onto paper and into the public's hands.  That WORLD I created, and its UNIVERSE, will live on in many parallel stories, and THE EXORCIST is the first foray into realizing this vision. My entire music and prayer collection [wav file downloads, 15 CDs total, valued at $90] is my GIFT to all backers. All backers will also be publicly thanked on our social media.BOOK 1 - EXORCIST & SLAVERThe action takes place on Earth in a timeless dimension. The Exorcist takes form and meets her nemesis, Slaver. Their missions formalize in front of them, but what will they do? Will they do what is easy and pre planned for each, or will they allow their newly beating hearts dictate another way?The main goal was to join all people and their personal beliefs to fight evil by facing the past and embracing the future. Today I co-founded VUGA Enterprises with Gene Avakyan in order to bring my message to a larger audience. THE EXORCIST - the superhero that I created - a sexy and tough girl fighting evil - is brought to life by an international co-op of artists, illustrators and actors, combining music and exclusive fashions. She will be the star of this series of cosmic proportions - and it all starts with the limited editions of books 1 and 2 (available in this project). These books will actually double the page-count - 48 pages total - containing both the initial rough sketches as well as the finished, full-color pages and cells. Her SUPER POWER consists of being tuned in to the mystical world that most mortals do not have access to. She doesn't want this power thrust upon her, but she must carry her burden and accomplish her mission of fighting evil. She can travel through time and receives new powers as she defeats each evil foe.She will be facing unique enemies - both visually and spiritually - from demons to gargoyles, to dark archangels, zombies, and even satan himself. On her quest she will get help from angels and light archangels, and spirits and mythological creatures. Her nemesis - SLAVER - controls the power of all the dark forces and is her main enemy. Two heroes – of goodness and light, of darkness and evil, will battle for our world.There has never been a comic quite like this - an EPIC story that will be rendered in an EPIC manner! We will bring all that is good in all faiths into a single force of light, and do so in a stunning fashion.The first two books have been finalized - read the script and storyline below! As the project continues we will replace parts of the script with images from the artists. After we reach $1,000 in funding, we will show you a rough sketch of the first book! All 94 panels! Join us! We will be running lots of social flash mob events around Los Angeles as well, where I will become THE EXORCIST and go out in costume to get the people going.

Solar eclipse. The sun has gone out.
An odd black smoke is spreading across the desert and the ground has cracked.
Darkness comes and a strong wind picks up.
From the smoke and sand comes a human figure in a long black robe with a large hood pulled up over the head.
Exorcist's face close - I feel the smoke - my eyes do not see well. Who am I? Why am I here?
Light slowly comes back and the wind dies down. ""Why is it so hard to move? What world is this?""
The mysterious figure pulls off the hood and opens the robe. ""I only remember the beam of light, of soaring high above.""
A sexy female body is revealed inside.  ""I saw this planet and I saw the people who were there.""
""My God, I am human??""
The sun shone brighter. ""And light returned to the Earth""
Exorcist screamed in pain. ""My chest burns!""
On her chest a flame ignited, and from this flame came a large gold medallion.
Touching her medallion, as if remembering something - ""I am the Exorcist and must prevail over the darkness that is taking over on Earth. Why did you give me this mission? Why??!!!!""  
She collapses, drained.  
Evening arrives. ""And you shall revel by the sun and by the moon.""
Her eyes open. ""I was not brought back up, I must battle the forces of darkness here on Earth.""
From the sands arise blue bodies of the damned souls.
They all go move the Exorcist, since they were summoned to destroy her. ""We will destroy you!""
She swings her braids ""My first weapon!""
She destroys them one at a time with the scorpion stinger at ends of her braids, until none of them are standing. ""What now, dead fodder? Still think you can destroy me?""
Face close up - ""Anyone else want to be made into mince-meat?""
A thin gold ring appears mid-air and floats toward her ""Am I engaged all of a sudden?  No, I don't think I'm done having fun!""
The gold ring slides onto her finger ""But, if its only a gift, I guess it's ok. Thank you - upstairs!""
An angel, as if summoned, flies to her and stands behind her. ""And if this is a helper and not a groom, I guess I'm cool with it.""
The Exorcist steps up to the angel ""I prefer it up higher""
The angel carries her into the sky ""Fly Heavenly Air - the only way to fly!""
They fly toward a city that appears in the distance. “Back to the city. Maybe I can catch a movie. More fun than up in the sky.”
Dark angels begin to appear in the sky. ""We are the guardians. You are not allowed here.""
Exorcist swings her medallion ""But I have a ticket! How do you like it?""
She spins it around her head and it makes the sound ""VUUUUGAAAAAAAA""
A cross appears on the medallion. ""Be gone in the name of Christ""
The cross starts glowing ""and the dark forces shall fall from the site of the holy""
Dark angels collapse to the ground, screaming.
A second golden ring appears and slides on to her finger ""You know how we girls love gifts! Golden ones most of all. Any diamonds coming?""
Another angel appears and joins her on her journey.
At the edge of the desert we see horns rise from sand ""What in hell?""
A giant human male figure comes out of the sand (big pic) ""Who dares disturb me? A rag doll and a couple of insects?""
Close up on Exorcist ""You need to learn to be more polite when you address The Exorcist!""
Close up on his head with horns - he speaks: ""My name is Azazel. I am master here. This city is mine!""
Exorcist and the angels stop. She speaks - ""You have no rights to this city. Leave here or you will die here.""
Close up on Exorcist. She speaks - ""You have no rights to this city. Leave here or you will die here.""
Azazel laughs. ""You will kill me? This place has been mine for thousands of years. Leave or you will die yourself.""
Exorcist replies: ""Ha! Your horns are smarter than your brain, demon! I think I’ll keep them as a souvenir.""
Exorcist swings her braids, ""Let's see how tough they really are!""
Azazel’s horns fly off his head. ""AAAAAA! How dare you?""
The demon screams and there is black blood coming from his head. ""I will get you! You have no idea who you are messing with, rag doll!""
He digs himself into the sand ""I'm not that easy to kill.""
Exorcist points her medallion at the sand and it starts to burn through it, ""I think I'll cook you for lunch, you horned toad.""
Snakes come from under the ground in giant swarms. ""Sssssssss""
They come to rescue Azazel and draw ancient and mystical symbols, writhe around, and kick up a lot of sand. ""You will not penetrate the sand.""
Exorcist spins her medallion ""VUUUUUUUGAAAAAAAA""!
She burns them down with light coming from her cross which replaced the medallion ""in the name of the burning light of all that is holy, I command you be gone.""
The snakes increase in number ""Тhere are more of us than you think.""
She yanks on her fishnet stockings and a part comes off  ""and I have a surprise for you, dirty rattlers!""
The stocking she pulled off is getting bigger and becoming a giant net. ""Ready to go fishing?""
She swings it like a lasso and throws it over all the snakes, pulling it toward her. ""SSSSSSSS, we're trapped!  SSSSSSSS It's all over!""
Exorcist squeezes the net and the snakes inside it are shredded ""There's a new dish in town - ground demon snake. Who'd like a plate?""
The sun is going down. Sky is getting darker ""More guests? When can I finally hit the city and see a movie?""
In the distance appears a handsome young man. ""Hmmmm, what a handsome guy.  I'll have to be friendly and meet him. A bit...closer.""
Close up он Exorcist's eyes ас they squint ""Something is not right. Something is wrong. Where did he come from?""
Exorcist makes a circle with her index fingers and thumbs and looks through it at the young man, “Now I will see your real face!”
She sees his handsome face,. She says ""Show your true self"",
She sees the young man change before her eyes. His skin changes into a lizard’s scaly skin. ""No way. It wasn't a cute guy? This cannot be...""
His eyes are filled with a green glow. ""Green eyes...his eyes are....his eyes........Noooooooo!""
His body starts to squirm and writhe, and his spine extends into a tail. (big pic) ""You...see... me?  You ... saw … ME!""
A bright flame is ignited in his eyes, ""You've waited for this moment for some time. No?""
Exorcist understands that, hiding under his human appearance, who she is really facing. Close up - ""SLAVER! the main servant of all the dark forces! You are my enemy and my mission - we will settle this.""
She takes her medallion and it displays the main symbol. It glows brighter. ""In the name of all that is holy!""
Close up face of Slaver ""Hahahahaha""
The servant of hell grows bigger, and has become huge, ""You are still far too weak to face me.""
Close up The Exorcist's eyes “my powers are waning, but but I have no choice and must accept the duel”.
The Slaver squints his eyes and extends his arms. Steel wings begin to grow out of them.""I am stronger than you and will destroy you. Close your eyes NOW!""
Close up on the Exorcist  ""NO!""
Suddenly their eyes meet.
Exorcist extends her right hand and it begins to emit a bright light toward the servant. ""Let there be light!""
He tilts his head and freezes ""Is that the best you can do?""
He feels a heartbeat in his chest, ""I have a heart?""
He stops and just observes her. ""What a weird feeling - I cannot kill her. I won't be able to go through with it.""
She screams - ""Fight or I will destroy you where you stand!""
Slaver lowers his wings. ""No, I don’t want to. Leave this planet - you won’t survive here. We have risen and will soon take over.""
Exorcist cries, ""I must kill you to free the Earth!""
Slaver begs ""LEAVE!"" Close up on his eyes.
He turns and dissolves into the sand. ""Farewell""
Exorcist is alone with her two angels. “I’m too weak to defeat the Slaver. He could have killed me, but chose not to… Oh, God!”
Close up: A tear rolls down her cheek. “he...spared my life! What is this feeling in my chest? My heart beats! ”
Close up on her lips ""I've heard of love. Is this what it feels like?""
Darkness falls suddenly and a giant clock face appears in sky.
Snakes appear from all around her. “Hisssssssss…”
Giant frightening figure appears out of flames from fissures in the Earth.
“I am Kronos, master of time. You will leave here...NOW!”
Exorcist, close up on face, fear in her eyes. “What? Where?” Lightning and tornadoes are behind her, surrounding her.
Exorcist is pulled into the clock face, screaming. “Noooooooo!”
Moscow Kremlin, the sky is black, gargoyles are sitting perched on the Mausoleum.
Exorcist comes flying from the giant clock face on the Kremlin, followed by her two angels. “ААААААА……..”
BOOK 2 - RED HELLSynopsis   The action takes place in a Moscow of 2020. Exorcist is thrown there with her two angels. The country is full of monsters and dark angels, spirits that the common people cannot see.  The epicenter of evil in 2020 is the Kremlin Mausoleum. Lenin rises from his tomb, grows huge, and now has horns on his head. He is the demon Vaal. The curse of blindness was cast on the people of Russia by the demoness Astarta and her helpers Naama and Nega. The demon of laziness, Belfegor, guards all churches. Exorcist kills the gargoyles and Belfegor and receives Archangels Michael and Gabriel. Gabriel fights Astarta and her cohorts. Michael destroys Vaal. The mausoleum explodes and falls into giant chasm, into Satan’s open mouth. Slaver appears in the guise of different people, sometimes a child, sometimes an old woman. He observes the Exorcist from a distance. Exorcist is given new rings and powers and can now blind and strike back with fire. Slaver takes on his natural appearance but starts growing bigger and bigger. Their eyes meet. A command comes from beneath the ground - “KILL”. Slaver, scaly skin and wings, flaps hard and screams at the Exorcist. Seeing that she still lacks the power to fight, and noticing another clock, The Exorcist screams “Kronos!” Kronos appears and the clock on the Kremlin turns into a spiral. Exorcist is pulled into this clock and is ejected in China.",36.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p>Hi everyone!<br/>My name is Bill Cunningham and if you’re into comics (who isn’t?) you may have heard of me and my company, <a href=""http://www.pulp2ohpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Pulp 2.0</strong></a>.    We’ve been successful in restoring, redesigning and republishing classic comics and pulp like Graham Nolan’s MONSTER ISLAND,  John Wooley &amp; Terry Tidwell’s TWILIGHT AVENGER, Chris Ecker &amp; Gary Carlson’s BIG BANG COMICS COLLECTION and Don Glut’s NEW ADVENTURES OF FRANKENSTEIN COLLECTION.  <br/><br/>The Pulp 2.0 brand has always been to <i>reclaim the best of the past, and to seek out the pulp that fans haven’t seen before, but should.</i>  Over the past year I’ve been reaching out to creators and fans in other countries to find the sort of comics entertainment that fans can’t get in the USA. Comics with a reputation for quality pulp entertainment. Comics that go for the throat.  That’s why I want to introduce you to <i><strong>KILLER</strong></i> - a terrific comic book series from Chile.<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534801830/xfcfaa1vlv2osmvvfieb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i><strong>KILLER</strong></i> is just the sort of project that ticks all of the boxes:   It’s a comic we haven’t seen before in the United States (or English-speaking countries for that matter), it’s not the usual superhero fare - it’s a spy action-adventure book, and it’s well crafted. <i><strong>KILLER</strong></i> is a comic that speaks to the hard-hitting, raw, action entertainment of the 1970’s - so much so that its lead character looks like Charles Bronson!!!!  <br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534804523/glo713kyh009detpxdsy.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><br/>Gabler, the artist of the Chilean original 1960’s JAMES BOND 007  comics published by Zig-Zag, created KILLER to continue the spy action of the 007 comics, but with a rougher edge in both story and character. The stories featured the adventures of a man code-named ""Jack Killer"", a British secret agent and ladies man with the rough hewn look of Charles Bronson.  Jack Killer acts to thwart conspiracies and attacks by the KGB and <i>Tarantula</i> - a global criminal cartel.  If you like <i>Matt Helm, Callan</i> and <i>Harry Palmer</i> - then you’re going to like the distinctive, two-fisted flavor of <i><strong>KILLER</strong></i>.   The character lives up to his name.</p>

<p>In 1974, nine <i><strong>KILLER</strong></i> stories were originally published in Chile and Argentina. However Chile’s inflation under the Pinochet government was so volatile, the price of everything changed from week to week and decimated the comics industry. One <i><strong>KILLER</strong></i> story remained in Gabler's desk until 2017. With the help of some new artists he completed the story and cover for Acciòn Comics. The restored comic was welcomed by Chilean fans and the international media; with stories published in Brazil, Mexico, Ecuador and the Netherlands.</p>

</div></div>","Hi everyone!My name is Bill Cunningham and if you’re into comics (who isn’t?) you may have heard of me and my company, Pulp 2.0.    We’ve been successful in restoring, redesigning and republishing classic comics and pulp like Graham Nolan’s MONSTER ISLAND,  John Wooley & Terry Tidwell’s TWILIGHT AVENGER, Chris Ecker & Gary Carlson’s BIG BANG COMICS COLLECTION and Don Glut’s NEW ADVENTURES OF FRANKENSTEIN COLLECTION.  The Pulp 2.0 brand has always been to reclaim the best of the past, and to seek out the pulp that fans haven’t seen before, but should.  Over the past year I’ve been reaching out to creators and fans in other countries to find the sort of comics entertainment that fans can’t get in the USA. Comics with a reputation for quality pulp entertainment. Comics that go for the throat.  That’s why I want to introduce you to KILLER - a terrific comic book series from Chile.
KILLER is just the sort of project that ticks all of the boxes:   It’s a comic we haven’t seen before in the United States (or English-speaking countries for that matter), it’s not the usual superhero fare - it’s a spy action-adventure book, and it’s well crafted. KILLER is a comic that speaks to the hard-hitting, raw, action entertainment of the 1970’s - so much so that its lead character looks like Charles Bronson!!!!  Gabler, the artist of the Chilean original 1960’s JAMES BOND 007  comics published by Zig-Zag, created KILLER to continue the spy action of the 007 comics, but with a rougher edge in both story and character. The stories featured the adventures of a man code-named ""Jack Killer"", a British secret agent and ladies man with the rough hewn look of Charles Bronson.  Jack Killer acts to thwart conspiracies and attacks by the KGB and Tarantula - a global criminal cartel.  If you like Matt Helm, Callan and Harry Palmer - then you’re going to like the distinctive, two-fisted flavor of KILLER.   The character lives up to his name.

In 1974, nine KILLER stories were originally published in Chile and Argentina. However Chile’s inflation under the Pinochet government was so volatile, the price of everything changed from week to week and decimated the comics industry. One KILLER story remained in Gabler's desk until 2017. With the help of some new artists he completed the story and cover for Acciòn Comics. The restored comic was welcomed by Chilean fans and the international media; with stories published in Brazil, Mexico, Ecuador and the Netherlands.
 But let’s face it - KILLER is a comic that is over 43 years old!  It’s going to take a lot of sweat and talent to restore the artwork.  To accomplish this, I’m partnering with Acciòn Comics to scan all of the original artwork, and translate it to English.   It’s a job that will cover over 320+ pages of material - and that doesn’t include the covers, and backmatter from the original comics.  That’s where we need your help - financing the number of artists and hours it is going to take to scan all of the artwork that was rescued from Germàn Gabler’s basement, provide a basic English translation of the comic in a format for me to edit and enhance, and develop behind-the-scenes material from the original comics and reference files.  But even though it's a lot of work - make no mistake, KILLER is a comic worth pursuing.

Our Goal is simple:  Raise $6,000 to cover the following costs -

Use Photoshop and Illustrator to fix the artwork as necessary so we have clean art to work from.
Re-letter the 320+ comic scans / Adobe Illustrator files into English.
Polish that rough English translation so that it reads and flows well.


This $6,000 amount allows us to publish five issues of a cool 64-page Black & White comic like the pages you see here. That's our primary focus. However we don’t want to stop there. We have stretch goals we would like to hit in order to develop a bigger comic book release, and develop and expand KILLER into other media:

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are a collective of diverse LGBTQ+A individuals who are passionate about bringing our colourful stories to the community &amp; share with the world at large. In comic form!</p>
<p><strong>Straight In</strong> was the story that started it all. Inspired by true-to-life events, with a flair of embellishment &amp; a healthy dose of gay humor, <strong>Straight In</strong> follows Nina as she's thrust from her quiet, engaged life in the UK into a world of self-discovery &amp; inhibition in downtown Toronto, after inheriting her late uncle's house.</p>
<p>From there, we spun-off <strong>Agent Undisclothed</strong>. An account of Nina's late uncle Lou's adventures as a cold war era super-spy ...in drag. <strong>Agent Undisclothed</strong> takes the embellishment of SI, sprinkles it with historical accuracy, &amp; smothers it in suspenseful glee. That's right: Drag, Spies, Hilarity, &amp; ...Soviets? Why not?</p>
<p>What can you help us with? We are preparing to launch our first-ever cross-over series. That's right! Nina's life &amp; the world of uncle Lou are about to collide! ...But we need your help to keep their stories going!</p>

<p><strong>The Gilded Age</strong> is about a group of performers, the Branning Troupe. Half actors and half carnival folk, the group travels throughout the countries of Victorian Era Europe. For some it offers a direction to their lives, others get the adoration of the crowds, and the rest find simple refuge from a world which has cast them out.</p>
<p>The plan for The Gilded Age came from an image of a western style gunfighter with a mechanical arm. Immediately my mind started scrambling with thoughts of a Steampunk world approaching a crossroads of not only technology and magic but of the direction the world would take. Amongst that loose backdrop, I set the characters of Hanna and Elias on a mission to save King and country.</p>
<p>However, that is the type of plan which requires a readership. In this day and age to ask potential readers to buy into an unknown story/creator is a difficult proposition. To hope that they stick around for a four-issue story-arc... I wasn't sure.</p>
<p>I rethought the plan, reworked the story, and came up with something bigger, yet easier to digest. Each story would be done-in-one. They would tell stories that could be enjoyed by anyone picking up a random issue. The issues would have overlapping characters, but by and large, each issue would focus on one or a pair of characters.</p>
<p>The key would be that I was slowly building up my world. And making the readers care about various characters by giving each the screen time they deserved. And by doing this I allowed for different types of stories within the same world. Whether that is Western or Horror or a Heist or something Fantastical, the hope has always been to build the world from the character's eyes rather than try and hit you with one thousand years of history.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The Gilded Age has successfully ran a crowdfunding campaign in order to get the very first print run. Due to this initial order, I will have no problem fulfilling any additional orders from this campaign. The target date for getting those books back from the printer is April 2018.</p>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","The Gilded Age is about a group of performers, the Branning Troupe. Half actors and half carnival folk, the group travels throughout the countries of Victorian Era Europe. For some it offers a direction to their lives, others get the adoration of the crowds, and the rest find simple refuge from a world which has cast them out.
The plan for The Gilded Age came from an image of a western style gunfighter with a mechanical arm. Immediately my mind started scrambling with thoughts of a Steampunk world approaching a crossroads of not only technology and magic but of the direction the world would take. Amongst that loose backdrop, I set the characters of Hanna and Elias on a mission to save King and country.
However, that is the type of plan which requires a readership. In this day and age to ask potential readers to buy into an unknown story/creator is a difficult proposition. To hope that they stick around for a four-issue story-arc... I wasn't sure.
I rethought the plan, reworked the story, and came up with something bigger, yet easier to digest. Each story would be done-in-one. They would tell stories that could be enjoyed by anyone picking up a random issue. The issues would have overlapping characters, but by and large, each issue would focus on one or a pair of characters.
The key would be that I was slowly building up my world. And making the readers care about various characters by giving each the screen time they deserved. And by doing this I allowed for different types of stories within the same world. Whether that is Western or Horror or a Heist or something Fantastical, the hope has always been to build the world from the character's eyes rather than try and hit you with one thousand years of history.
We've collected all four issues into this Volume One with an amazing brand new cover from La'Vata O'Neal.

<h3><strong>Didn't I hear you already had a deal with the publisher Humanoids?</strong></h3>
<p>Great question, inquisitive imaginary reader. You might have heard that esteemed publisher Humanoids is publishing SPACE BASTARDS as periodical comic books, which will be the very first time SPACE BASTARDS is available at discerning comic shops across the country. That’s exciting! And that's how <strong><i>most</i></strong> people are going to find and experience the story. (But you're here, so clearly you AREN'T 'most people'...)</p>
<p>We’re bringing SPACE BASTARDS to Indiegogo so we can continue to pay advances to the artists -- and keep telling the sick, twisted stories of the Intergalactic Postal Service OUR way.  These Hardcover Volumes are for collectors, for fans of our artists, and for everyone who appreciates a more dynamic, less linear version of the story. Here we present SPACE BASTARDS in Tarantino-esque fashion. Our version dives down rabbit holes and takes the round about way so that you get the whole story the way we originally intended. It's a presentation that just wouldn't work as a monthly release. And it's freaking huge, did we mention that?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>“A series of surreal and often bloody vignettes by some of the best artists in the business… A Looney Tunes-esque parade of debauchery and dynamism, as these artists work their magic to produce a comprehensive, and quite crazy, portrait of a universe gone mad.”—SCREENRANT</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>“Tarantino like… Who better to bring their story to life than The Boys’ Darick Robertson? If there is anyone who could depict this brand of action mixed with touches of humor and the aforementioned over the top violence, it is Robertson. And man does he come through.”—GEEK VIBES NATION</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>""New planets!, corrupt governments!, aliens!, dinosaurs! and blatant sexuality!.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>“Robertson brings all of his famous grit and gore to Space Bastards...Space Bastards is about as crazy as it sounds. It’s a blood-splattered charge across the galaxy, with lots of parcels to deliver.”— MONKEYS FIGHTING ROBOTS</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>“A glorious grim, gritty and darkly humoured debut… A brash, ballsy book with a dark and satisfying humour running through it, with not one but two revelations at the end that should have you hungry for more.”—COMICON.COM</strong></p>

<p><strong>“Interesting to say the least… an original concept with a lot of violence and action to get your teeth into.”—IMPULSE GAMER</strong></p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>We have fully produced and printed SPACE BASTARDS Volume 1 and Volume 2. All artists, letterers, and colorists have already been paid. If you pledge, you will be getting one sent to you as soon as this campaign ends. The only challenges/risks are those inherent in shipping a three-pound oversized book. We will be using corrugated folding mailers and bubble wrap to make sure the book gets to you undamaged. *SHIPPING IS EXTRA* The big risk to this campaign will be international shipping costs. On top of that, some, but not all, international backers will have to pay import tax and duty upon receiving their rewards.</p>
<p>Please see FAQ for ESTIMATES before pledging.</p>
<p>There may be some delays with the mail itself, because delivering mail is hard (especially in a pandemic). The USPS has nothing on the Intergalactic Postal Service. *PLEASE READ THE FAQ BEFORE PLEDGING!*</p>
<p>Oh yeah, one more challenge: <strong>Keanu was not involved in producing this book/campaign.</strong></p>

“Tarantino like… Who better to bring their story to life than The Boys’ Darick Robertson? If there is anyone who could depict this brand of action mixed with touches of humor and the aforementioned over the top violence, it is Robertson. And man does he come through.”—GEEK VIBES NATION
 
""New planets!, corrupt governments!, aliens!, dinosaurs! and blatant sexuality!. That hologram naked lady newscaster was interesting… This first issue is chock full of the best kind of insanity. I am dancing in my seat waiting to see what comes next. This has totally hooked me, and if you need a laugh, it’ll hook you too!”—FANGIRL NATION
 
“Robertson brings all of his famous grit and gore to Space Bastards...Space Bastards is about as crazy as it sounds. It’s a blood-splattered charge across the galaxy, with lots of parcels to deliver.”— MONKEYS FIGHTING ROBOTS
 
“A glorious grim, gritty and darkly humoured debut… A brash, ballsy book with a dark and satisfying humour running through it, with not one but two revelations at the end that should have you hungry for more.”—COMICON.COM
 
“Interesting to say the least… an original concept with a lot of violence and action to get your teeth into.”—IMPULSE GAMER
 
Risks and challenges
We have fully produced and printed SPACE BASTARDS Volume 1 and Volume 2. All artists, letterers, and colorists have already been paid. If you pledge, you will be getting one sent to you as soon as this campaign ends. The only challenges/risks are those inherent in shipping a three-pound oversized book. We will be using corrugated folding mailers and bubble wrap to make sure the book gets to you undamaged. *SHIPPING IS EXTRA* The big risk to this campaign will be international shipping costs. On top of that, some, but not all, international backers will have to pay import tax and duty upon receiving their rewards.
Please see FAQ for ESTIMATES before pledging.
There may be some delays with the mail itself, because delivering mail is hard (especially in a pandemic). The USPS has nothing on the Intergalactic Postal Service. *PLEASE READ THE FAQ BEFORE PLEDGING!*
Oh yeah, one more challenge: Keanu was not involved in producing this book/campaign.",12.0,0,"1 Campaign

Mendoza, Letters by Wilson Ramos, Jr.) -- Cthulhu has conquered another world, but all he really wants is his master to come find him. Song for the Harbinger (art by Brianna Gilmartin, words by Heather Kenealy) -- Ghroth doesn't understand why nobody likes his singing, all he wants to do is harmonize with planets, and they keep blowing up. The Yag-Kosha Mystery (art and words by Kelly Dochy) -- Yag-Kosha, the pacifist alien, has a mysterious koan for you. Mons (art and words by Matthew Childers) --Explorers on Mars find an ancient tome that could unlock the secrets of the universe, or unleash a Lovecraftian horror. The Summoning of Brkthruslpk (art by Robin Dassen, words by Don Perkins) -- A group of kids works to summon the ancient god Brkthruslpk onto the world. No DQ (art and words by Ryan Fisher) -- A weak, sickly wrestling fan gets to live out his fantasy of being a star after a mysterious stranger endowing him with an enchanted garment. Slumber (art by Lloyd Ladera, words by Sarah Anderson) -- After being woken up on a spaceship, a man has to escape the Lovecraftian horror chasing him. That's Cthulhu to You (art by Zac Skellington, words by Leo Baxter Kiker) -- An oddities store gets a new pet: Cthulhu. How to Summon the Dark Lord Hastur (Art by Cara Stemo, words by Johnny C, letters by Travis Duda, logo design by Nathan Burns) -- A card game, a tragic birth, a goverment experiment, and a violent crime all converge to release a deadly horror on the world. Church of Mormo (art by Claire Leslie, words by N.S. Kane) -- Greek spirit Mormo goes door to door trying to recruit Cthulhu worshipers to her cause. She Came Upon a Great Tree (art by Nick Kremenek, words by Mike Speakman, edited by Greg Smith) -- A delivery driver and part-time cultist must find a great tree to unleash Cthulhu and Hastur onto the world. Flycatcher (art by Dan Scalisi, words by Frank Martin) -- Even though they have been warned for years, the fly people of Dipterra are not prepared for the wrath of Yba'sokug. The Rally (art and words by Mary Bellamy) -- Lucifer needs new generals, and has decided to recruit Lovecraftian gods to his cause. Why is this book going to be so awesome? 1. It's 176 pages of glorious comics! - That's a massive amount of awesome comics about monsters! Over 150 pages and 35 stories!2. It's gonna be in hardcover! - There are lots of comics, but how many are printed in hardcover? Not many! 3. All the UV spotting! There's gonna be spot UV all over the cover. I love spot UV and I've gotten exceedingly good at using it over the years. There might even be a little surprise if we can blow past our regular goal on that front. 4. Glossy art paper - Most books are printed in gloss lamination, trapping all the glorious line work under an ugly, gross, yellow film. This anthology is different. It's printed on glossy art paper, which means the ink shines on top of the paper and looks like it's simmering, just like the any other art book on the market today. After all, we believe that comics are beautiful works of art and should be printed as such. 5. Our creators have credits from all your favorites companies. Our creators have worked with Marvel, DC, Oni, Tokyopop, Heavy Metal, Fantagraphics, Upper Deck, Sony, and more along with brands like Teen Titans, My Little Pony, Invader Zim, Ghostbusters,Horizon Zero Dawn, and more. We have creators who have been nominated for Eisners, won Glyphs, Silver Eagles, WGA awards, and more! 6. There are just so many many Lovecraftian gods and monsters. There was only one rule in this anthology; all of the stories needed to contain at least one Lovecraftian god or monster. This book is full of different types gods you know like Cthulhu and Azathoth, and ones you've never heard of as well! And you can get the whole book, including shipping, plus a pdf copy AND audio commentary for just $40, INCLUDING SHIPPING (in the US, at least)! Who drew that dope cover?  It was drawn by Aaron Alexovich, creator of my favorite indie comic of all time, Serenity Rose, a 500+ page graphic novel about a previously famous witch trying to come to terms with her powers in a very weird town. Read it. Buy it. Love it.   If you've never read that book, you probably know him from his work on Invader Zim, both the television show and more recently on the comic book. Aaron is a powerhouse in the world of indie books, and Zim is one of my favorite animated shows of all time. He also drew the cover for the Monsters and Other Scary S^&t anthology. I really wanted him to come back for this anthology too, and I was so stoked when he said yes!  On top of it all, Aaron might be one of the few people on earth that loves Lovecraft, especially Cthulhu, even more than me, which I once didn't think possible.Did Dirk Manning really write the foreword? Yes, Dirk Manning, an icon of independent Lovecraftian horror comics, wrote the foreword for Cthulhu is Hard to Spell. He didn't have time to contribute, but he asked me if he could do the foreword, and I of course said yes. Dirk has raised a ton of money for Nightmare World, Tales of Mr. Rhee, and more, and that he wanted to contribute to this book means the world to me. Here is a snippet of what he wrote, which made me smile. For now, take the time to enjoy this book.While it’s (another) unspoken truth that anthologies are often a hit-and-miss prospect, I can honestly say that there wasn’t a story in this collection that I didn’t enjoy... which shouldn’t be surprising since it’s a reminder that just like you’re not alone in what you know and feel, these stories reminded me I’m not alone either.I was honored when I read those words. So yes, file under: Dirk Approved. What are the other stories in the book? Ashes to Ashes (art by Laura Neubert, words by Virginia Drohan) --  Quachil Uttaus learns what it means to be human.     One Last Chance (art by Ben Herrera, words by K.J. Kaminski, colors by Emmanuel Torres) -- Humanity has one last chance to save the universe as they fight against the forces of Zathog on the planet Zarr. A 10,000 Year Curse (art by Dave Lentz, words by Dave Lentz and Ryan Kroboth, Inks by Rob Simmons, Colors by Ryan Kroboth) -- Even the old gods needs a night off, but it's often impossible to find a reliable babysitter, even for them. The Call of Stone (art and words by Shannon Kirkwood) -- After a woman dies, she finds her true purpose in protecting the Star Mother. Love Story (art and words by Christie Shinn) -- A love story about Mnomquah and Oorn's eternal love. Basatan vs. Satan (art by Lady Beaver, Words by Steve Waldinger, letters by T. Perran Mitchell) -- Basatan returns to the surface to take his rightful place as ruler of Earth, but Satan has other plans.The Art of Losing (art and words by Nathan Leuth) -- After her family dies and the Apocalypse comes, a young woman finds strength in music. Sunset at Sarnath (art by Wesley Wong, words by Wesley Sun) -- An old man, a young girl, and a pig discuss who was responsible for the end of the world. The Marriage Counselor (art by Melissa J Massey, words by Madeleine Holly-Rosing) -- Mnomquah and Oorn go to marriage counseling, because even the best marriages fall apart sometimes. The Eyes of Yba'Sokug (art by Jonathan Howard, words by Michael R. Martin) -- a poem about the end of the world, which feels eerily relevant in our current times. The Believer (art by Claudio Sanchez Viveros, words by Christian Douglas) -- A Nyarlathotep cultist pontificates over the horribleness of man as he speaks to his daughter. Rise (art and words by Bradley Sheridan) -- Hastur is frustrated that his minions cannot overtake a town run by a godzilla monster. The Calling (art by Katrina Kunstmann, words by Caleb Thusat) -- An adventurer fights his way through a dungeon in order to take on a Lovecraftian god. The Last Convention (art by Lea Seidman, words by Anne Toole) -- The world is over, and everyone has to choose how they are going to die by going to the last convention and being pitched by different cultists or the various Lovecraft gods. The Crossroads (art by Silvio DB, words by Terrance Grace) -- Lovecraft writes a letter to his ex-wife as he slowly goes mad. The MC (art by Nic Touris, words by Jack Holder, letters by Micah Myers) -- An agent to Lovecraftian gods has to deal with his unruly clients as he tries to get them work. Azathoth's Slumber (art by Erik Lervold, words by Russell Nohelty, additional colors by Vlaire Donaghue) -- The outer gods have been playing music to keep Azathoth asleep for millions of years and they are sick of it. That's it! Did you dig it? If you did, then it's time to pledge. Still on the fence? No worries. Click here to get a 50+ page preview. I hope you believe this is going to be an amazing anthology.

<p><i>Wavemen </i>will be a continuing series.  Episode 1 focuses on our main character, Momotaro, also known as Peach Boy.  In his legend, Momotaro and three animal

raiding Momotaro's village.  Momotaro and his friends face down the Oni 
King, kill all the monsters, and become legends. </p>

<b>Our story starts one year later and explores the question:  ""What happens when you send a fifteen-year-old-boy off to kill an island of monsters?""</b><br/><br/>
Momotaro is deeply conflicted over what happened on Oni Island.  Did he 
become a monster to defeat monsters?  He withdraws from everyone, even 
his parents, who are desperately trying to reconnect with this solemn 
stranger so different from the son they remember.  All Momotaro wants is
 to quietly retire, at age 16, and fade away.<br/>
<br/>
Then a ghost starts haunting his village, killing people one by one, and
 Momotaro feels called upon to be a hero once more.<br/>

<li>In just this first year of publishing we've been approached by artists, writers and comics historians with fascinating and exciting potential new books lacking nothing but the capitol to allow the creators the time needed to devote to these dream projects.</li> <li>We've already published the first volume in our ""Classics Reimagined"" series...""King Solomon's Mines"" by Mark Ellis and Pablo Marcos. It's received glowing reviews from those who jumped on the band wagon early.</li> <li>Inside every artist and writer is the ""dream"" story or creation that has their undivided love and effort. But 99% of the time it has to wait for the regular job to get through, for the regular income to filter in so the bills can be paid.

What We Need & What You Get Publishing is not cheap. A single graphic novel of 49 pages can cost well over $10,000 just to get it ready for printing. Artists have to eat, as do the writer, the editor, the production staff, etc. Then comes the printing costs...and shipping...and promotion if you expect anyone to know you've published something. All of this before you even have a copy to show someone...  Ying Ko is looking for $25,000 to prime the pump of a self sustaining stream of incredible works by the most talented authors and gifted artists that want to work with our company. Every donor to this campaign will be included in the ""Founders"" page included in every book we publish. Additional perks are available at various levels of commitment. All funds go to the production of additional volumes in our library...to artists and writers and production staff.    The Impact There are gems of stories out there...future classics that lie dormant because they don't fit the ""immediate blockbuster"" mold that mainstream publishers require before supporting...with just as much potential to become the next ""blockbuster"".  We already have 4 additional volumes in various stages of development...both in our Classics Reimagined"" line and in some new and exciting series. Our Classics"" line includes more Allan Quartermain, some Captain Nemo, and even some Professor Challenger! 
In just this first year of publishing we've been approached by artists, writers and comics historians with fascinating and exciting potential new books lacking nothing but the capitol to allow the creators the time needed to devote to these dream projects. We've already published the first volume in our ""Classics Reimagined"" series...""King Solomon's Mines"" by Mark Ellis and Pablo Marcos. It's received glowing reviews from those who jumped on the band wagon early. Inside every artist and writer is the ""dream"" story or creation that has their undivided love and effort. But 99% of the time it has to wait for the regular job to get through, for the regular income to filter in so the bills can be paid. And so it sits...a page done here and there when ever a free moment can be stolen from the daily schedule. The quality of these ""works of love"" always equal and even surpass the finest of the ""regular"" work.

<b>An </b><b>Introduction to Era</b>
</h2>
<p style=""letter-spacing: normal;"">Hi, my name is Scott B Henderson and <i>The Chronicles of Era: Book 2</i>  is the final three chapters of the first story arc of an epic fantasy graphic novel.</p>
<p style=""letter-spacing: normal;"">Book 1 of <i>The Chronicles of Era</i> was successfully funded on Indiegogo in 2013, and Book 2 seeks to build on that success by continuing the story of three youths in a fantastic world, with a mixture of high fantasy, steampunk, and soft science fiction  </p>

<br/><p>In Book 1* of <i>The Chronicles of Era</i>, readers were introduced to a world where mankind tried to create a paradise fit for the gods, only to have it collapse in a great cataclysm.

<p>The Illiam Imperium is expanding and looking to reclaim its lost flocks. Scores of missionaries are sent to the fringes of the known world to bring these wayward folks back within the fold, but a growing rebellion among the disenfranchised Joshians has caused an escalation in the power struggle.

<h4>A Note on Shipping</h4>
<p>Rewards going out beyond the borders of Canada will be shipped by the most basic of ground mail. As such there is no tracking. If you would prefer to have it shipped with tracking or receive it faster, an increased donation will be made. Please contact me to make such arrangements. </p>
<p>Rewards within Canada will be delivered by myself (if possible) or shipping is covered by the basic goal.</p>
<h2><b>My Background</b></h2>
<div>I've been drawing since childhood, and even at an early age I drew pictures to stories. In high school and university I met a few exceptional teachers who had a profound influence on me.  After receiving my bachelor of Fine Arts from the University of Manitoba I worked on digitally colouring comic books, working in custom framing, and all the while continuing to experiment and refine my storytelling.

An Introduction to Era

Hi, my name is Scott B Henderson and The Chronicles of Era: Book 2  is the final three chapters of the first story arc of an epic fantasy graphic novel.
Book 1 of The Chronicles of Era was successfully funded on Indiegogo in 2013, and Book 2 seeks to build on that success by continuing the story of three youths in a fantastic world, with a mixture of high fantasy, steampunk, and soft science fiction  

Where Book 1 Left Off


In Book 1* of The Chronicles of Era, readers were introduced to a world where mankind tried to create a paradise fit for the gods, only to have it collapse in a great cataclysm. Hundreds of years later the survivors rebuilt civilization, but their history is little more than myths and legends; a society fixated on the marvelous wonders of a lost age.  
The Illiam Imperium is expanding and looking to reclaim its lost flocks. Scores of missionaries are sent to the fringes of the known world to bring these wayward folks back within the fold, but a growing rebellion among the disenfranchised Joshians has caused an escalation in the power struggle. Seth and Sidrich escaped the slave trades by finding service with the Order of Lost, only to be exploited further by searching for remote Joshian villages. Meanwhile, Caitleth, a runaway from the Core, thinks she has found the adventure she was searching for, under the direct guidance of Father Partrich.*Additional excerpts from TCOE: Book 1 available in Gallery.
Where We Pick Up With Book 2
After a brief synopsis of the previous three chapters, Book 2 will resume where Book 1 ended: Seth's origins and the nature of his visions are explored, but the missionaries of the Order of Lost push for the final assimilation of the Joshian Nation back into the folds of the Imperium. The conflict between the Joshian rebels and the Imperium is a powder keg ready to explode with destructive force. Seth, Sidrich and Caitleth will have one last chance to change their course in the coming conflict
The Chronicles of Era: Whispers of Redemption Book 2* will be 118 pages of black and white line art, with four coloured chapter breaks, a new map of the world of Era and a dramatis personae. *Additional excerpts from TCOE: Book 2 available in Gallery.
The Perks
The primary perk will be the printed graphic novel The Chronicles of Era: Whispers of Redemption Book 2, but there are many options which will combine Book 2 with TCOE: Book 1. The Chronicles of Era: Book 2 will be approximately 118 pages (the primary story, with chapter breaks, will be 110 pages). Filled with black and white line art, the book will be broken up by 3 coloured chapter breaks and one epilogue.  Greg Waller will once again lend his amazing skills in colouring these breaks. Rounding out the book will be a dramatis personae of the characters, a revised world map, CIP and a summary of Book 1.  Other perks will include:

A PDF digital copy of TCOE: Book 2.

TCOE: Book 1 is 104 pages, black and white line art with 3 coloured chapter breaks. Includes Dramatis Personae, and map (old version). TCOE: Book 1 and its digital counterpart will be delivered at the end of the campaign.

Funding
Most of the funds in the initial goal goes towards the production of the graphic novel: its 200 copy print run, slip cases and other miscellaneous printing, art supplies, shipping costs, and Indiegogo related fees and taxes.  Nearly half is just for printing.
While this is a personal project that I work on in what time I can carve out of my schedule, exceeding the initial funding goal will help to keep the book on course, allow for dedicated time, as well as unlock additional perks to supporters.
A Note on Shipping
Rewards going out beyond the borders of Canada will be shipped by the most basic of ground mail. As such there is no tracking. If you would prefer to have it shipped with tracking or receive it faster, an increased donation will be made. Please contact me to make such arrangements. 
Rewards within Canada will be delivered by myself (if possible) or shipping is covered by the basic goal.
My Background
I've been drawing since childhood, and even at an early age I drew pictures to stories. In high school and university I met a few exceptional teachers who had a profound influence on me.  After receiving my bachelor of Fine Arts from the University of Manitoba I worked on digitally colouring comic books, working in custom framing, and all the while continuing to experiment and refine my storytelling. To date I've illustrated twelve graphic novels for Canadian publishers and educators, including: 7 Generations: A Plains Cree Saga (which was nominated for best illustrated book in the 2013 Manitoba Book Awards), Sugar Falls and three stories for Tales from Big Spirit and most recently Betty: The Helen Betty Osborne Story, and A Blanket of Butterflies.
What others have to say about The Chronicles of Era:
""Scott Henderson's Chronicles of Era is gripping High Fantasy that soars from strength to strength.  With each chapter, his hero's journey grows ever more hazardous. Court intrigue and lurking dangers abound, as the visions that guide him also curse him.  In the tradition of Nausicaä and ApocaliptiGirl, Henderson intricately renders intrepid adventure in a world flung back to the Dark Ages by a half-forgotten war, to skilfully reveal his hero's inspired future and audacious destiny."" Nicholas Burns - Arctic Comics, Super Shamou,True North



""Scott Henderson's work on 7 Generations and Tales from Big Spirit with David Alexander Robertson shows off his ability to tell real human drama up close and personal.  Henderson builds big worlds and big stories for the Chronicles of Era. If you want ancient robots, magical armies, sword fights, prophecies and high adventure then Chronicles of Era should be on your pull list.""


GMB Chomichuk The Imagination Manifesto, Infinitum, Midnight City



Risks and Challenges
Unlike my first campaign for TCOE: Book 1, the second instalment is still being worked on. However, more than a third of TCOE: Book 2 is complete. 
This has been a project of passion for many, many (many) years, and I have remained committed to it.  However, this is a personal project, not one that pays the bills--as much as I wish it did. The biggest challenge is carving out the necessary time to compete the remaining pages of the book in time for its due date (Central Canada Comic Con 2016, at the end of October).  The book will be completed, even if the crowd funding campaign were to fall short, but it could just be a bit delayed. Success in this campaign that exceeds my initial goal will help me to stay the course and get the book done on time. 
Which leads us to the final point: 

Other Ways You Can Help

I grew up collecting beach glass as a girl during the summers. It brought me so much joy to find that glistening treasure among the shells. It’s where the idea for the Lumins came from!

I’d be delighted to share!</p><p>My daughters and I want to bring a 120 page children's graphic novel, <i>Kora Kelly and the Life Keeper</i> into the world and get it published! Its Book 1 in the Glimmer Series.</p><p>The protagonist is Kora Kelly, a small yet mighty underwater creature called a Lumin. Lumins live in a self-created glass bulbs protected by sea foam on the Jetty along the shores of the ocean. The Lumins deliver sea glass to humans, or, at least they did, until Sarwen, the angry crab started cleaning up the ocean shoreline because he was tired of the mess that humans left behind. Kora must journey to stop Sarwen from disrupting the imbalance between the worlds. </p><p>The story begins when Kora cannot figure out how to turn off her glow. The Lumin's are able to glow, but they are so small that they often control their glow so that they do not get eaten by predators. Kora begins a journey to find out why she cannot turn off her glow. The Life Keeper is a magical necklace that Kora is entrusted with on her quest to help save Lumin glass. Along the way, Kora discovers more about her own special powers.</p><p>The book is filled with playful prose, a few Lumin songs and lots of light hearted magical twists and turns! </p><p>The Glimmer Series of underwater children's graphic novels aims to create sparkles in the hearts of parents and children worldwide and to raise awareness to be empowered to take inspired action to clean and protect our planet's oceans. </p><p>What started as a book quickly turned into a room in our home called the Luminarium, where we created the storyboard for the book and put it all along the wall.</p><p>Now, we need to fund the <strong>illustrations</strong> to bring the book to life and we need your help!

Each book will help to create new myths in our narrative about the complexity and challenges of our time when things are not just good or evil, black or white. It will also bring more attention and funds to social issues and eco challenges through the lens of a playful children’s perspective. </p><p>It's also my desire that children will learn to grow up embracing their unique glow and special gifts in the world, and that parents will encourage them. As a child, I was a sensitive one that loved creating imaginal worlds. As an adult, I’d love to find ways to restore and honor the magic of the planet. </p><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><p>This will be my first time publishing a graphic novel, though I have published and co-authored other books before.

It will also bring more attention and funds to social issues and eco challenges through the lens of a playful children’s perspective. It's also my desire that children will learn to grow up embracing their unique glow and special gifts in the world, and that parents will encourage them. As a child, I was a sensitive one that loved creating imaginal worlds. As an adult, I’d love to find ways to restore and honor the magic of the planet. Risks & ChallengesThis will be my first time publishing a graphic novel, though I have published and co-authored other books before. The main risk is that we will not raise enough funds to finish the illustrations and therefore publish the first edition.

<p>On the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming, the Fort Washakie middle school boys basketball team navigates everyday challenges of life on a reservation while preparing for their upcoming game in a neighboring town. Meanwhile, fierce creatures of Shoshone legend, small-beings known as the Nimerigar, have emerged from hiding with vengeance in their hearts. Through a twist of events, it becomes clear that the Nimerigar are setting their sites on the traveling basketball team as the first victims on their fervent trek for revenge. It all boils to a head in a bloody confrontation at the paramount landmark, Crowheart Butte, a place of particular historical and spiritual significance to the Eastern Shoshone tribe and its people...</p>
<p><i>Crowheart Butte</i> is a horror/fantasy graphic novel, but at its core is a stirring drama about a Native American teacher and coach and the team in which he guides and educates. The goal with this project was to tell an honest story that dealt with the real issues indigenous people face on U.S. reservations, but also to deliver a riveting creature-horror story that featured Native American characters often absent in not only horror, but popular culture in general.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>About the Creator</h3>
<p>My name is Zach Kennah, I am an artist and illustrator currently based in Los Angeles, California. After graduating from the University of Wyoming in 2014 with my BFA in Art, I moved to California to pursue a career in the arts. Having grown up in Wyoming, telling stories based in my home state is a trend that often shows up in my work. One of my favorite genres has always been horror, and I really appreciate when films, books, and comics push the boundaries of where the genre can go in terms of subject matter and originality in storytelling. In my own work, I often start with character and develop the story from there. I enjoy following characters naturally as opposed to in a contrived way designed to service plot whether it be in horror or any genre. I strive to present dynamic, unique, and diverse characters and I always try to implement them into my own work and ideas.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Funding, Impact, and the Risks Involved</h3>
<p>The good news is that the novel is 100% complete. It is a 168 page full-color book that has taken 2 years to finish, and, for lack of a better phrase, is a real passion project. My father grew up in Fort Washakie on the reservation, and because of this and my family history, I have always had a strong interest in Native culture, as well as being a proponent of awareness in relation to Native American history and current contemporary issues. <i>Crowheart Butte</i> is a work that represents a combination of my love for art and horror, and my admiration and respect for Native people .</p>
<p>The funding for this project will be primarily used for book printing costs, but some will also go toward promotion and, of course, shipping expenses. Full-color book printing is crazy expensive and I want to be able to print as many copies as possible. Additionally, if I reach my goal of $4,000, I pledge to donate $1 for every $20 I raise to the Wind River Foundation, a non-profit based in Jackson, Wyoming whose mission is to advance philanthropy that will empower the indigenous communities of the  Wind River Indian Reservation in their work toward cultural revitalization, social progress, and economic prosperity. In other words, if I raise my $4000 goal, $200 will be donated to this organization and then for every $20 I raise beyond my goal I will donate an additional $1.</p>
<p>The risks involved for contributors are minimal since I have already completed the book. I am extremely determined to get this novel made into its physical, printed form, and if I attain funding there is absolutely no way I will not succeed in this goal. Even if I do not get the funds from this campaign I am prepared to use my own savings in order to fulfill perk promises and print a small run of the book to at least get it out there. I have worked too long and hard on this project and it means far too much to me for it to never see the light of day. Ultimately, the more money I raise the higher number of books I can print and the more people will be able to read this story that I personally feel deserves to be told.</p>
<p>If you are unable to contribute, I completely understand. With the current state of things I know it is not easy for many of us. Even if we want to be giving and generous, we may simply not be able to due to recent economic struggles. I also know that there are many other incredible projects and artists out there that deserve your generosity, as well as various social and political causes that quite honestly may seem more important right now than art and entertainment. At the end of the day I am just happy that you have taken the time to read this and see what I have been working on for the last couple years. If you are unable to donate, please consider following me on Instagram @zachkennah and helping to spread the word to your own friends and followers. Thank you all so much, it really means a lot.</p>

<strong><i>Tom Bunk Drawing</i> </strong>:<strong> </strong>This is an original ink drawing created by artist Tom Bunk in 2015, prior to his creating the endpages for ""Black Eye No. 3."" It measures 9 x 8 inches on grey board. About Bunk: <p>Born Tomas Maria Bunk in Split, Croatia, he studied stage design and fine art at the Academy of Arts in Hamburg, Germany. In 1973, he moved to Berlin, where he began rendering humorous subjects in oil paintings. After selling these paintings in three successful shows, he turned to cartooning and contributed to underground comics in 1976.</p>
<p>His cartoon creations appeared monthly in the satirical magazine ""Pardon,"" other European comic magazines and comic anthologies. After collecting his comics in three books, he moved to New York in 1983 and began drawing for Raw, the graphic story magazine edited and published by Françoise Mouly and Art Spiegelman. He drew Topps trading cards, including ""Wacky Packages"" and ""Garbage Pail Kids."" In 1993, he became a regular ""Mad cartoonist"", and his contributions have led some to regard him as the modern-day replacement at ""Mad"" forWill Elder.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">HENRY ROSCOE: DETECTIVE, SORT OF</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">VOL. 1 - JUSTICE IS BLIND... <i>DRUNK</i></p>
<p><u>SYNOPSIS:</u></p>
<p>Henry O’Toole has intentionally underachieved in life.  With an IQ of 185, Henry understood that in order to grow up in Troubles Belfast it was best to not see or know too much.  Now an adult, he's been robotripping (mixing alcohol and cough medicine to slow his motor functions) for the majority of his life; happy to idle away the weather-beaten days in Belfast with friends, pub quizzes and suffering through the ritualistic humiliations of his ex-wife Joy and her new love Jimmy. </p>
<p> That is until Henry loses his job forcing him to re-evaluate his options and ultimately answer the call of the Raymond Chandler “romance” of private investigation work. With an ad in his local Tesco Metro and an almost homicidal determination to defeat the seemingly invincible local pub quiz champions Henry sees his world change almost overnight. Soon he is sucked into a deadly realm of drugs, sex, murder and picture rounds; as curiosity becomes intrigue and danger becomes death Henry finds himself out of his depth and tangled up in a Noir landscape so dark only the true gumshoe can emerge.  </p>

</div></div>","HENRY ROSCOE: DETECTIVE, SORT OF
VOL. 1 - JUSTICE IS BLIND... DRUNK
SYNOPSIS:
Henry O’Toole has intentionally underachieved in life.  With an IQ of 185, Henry understood that in order to grow up in Troubles Belfast it was best to not see or know too much.  Now an adult, he's been robotripping (mixing alcohol and cough medicine to slow his motor functions) for the majority of his life; happy to idle away the weather-beaten days in Belfast with friends, pub quizzes and suffering through the ritualistic humiliations of his ex-wife Joy and her new love Jimmy. 
 That is until Henry loses his job forcing him to re-evaluate his options and ultimately answer the call of the Raymond Chandler “romance” of private investigation work. With an ad in his local Tesco Metro and an almost homicidal determination to defeat the seemingly invincible local pub quiz champions Henry sees his world change almost overnight. Soon he is sucked into a deadly realm of drugs, sex, murder and picture rounds; as curiosity becomes intrigue and danger becomes death Henry finds himself out of his depth and tangled up in a Noir landscape so dark only the true gumshoe can emerge.  
Henry Roscoe: Detective, Sort of is part murder-mystery, part sports story (for the physically unfit/asthmatic) set against the backdrop of a modern day Belfast as chiaroscuro-clad and atmospheric as the Warner Bros. lot of 1940s Hollywood.

<p><strong>The Rock Begins To Roll at GROUND ZERO!</strong></p>
<p>A multi-species crew of aliens on the run, cast away on a strange planet, on a broken ship with a dead pilot. An evil Confederation in pursuit across the universe. How will a naive songstress with a career in dire straits save the day?</p>
<p>Captain ""Big Daddy"" Ray, his first mate Lobo, cryptic humanoid RevC2 and their pilot have been on many a smuggling run on the BFS9000, a ship that undoubtedly has seen better days. On their way back from a bounty hunt, they get intercepted by a Confederation patrol, right around the Sol system.</p>
<p>Heavy fire is exchanged, and after a strenuous fight, the BFS9000 is forced into an emergency landing on Terra, a primitive but densely populated world who still has never had contact with life forms from other galaxies.</p>
<p>While the pilot daringly manages to salvage the precious cargo and the lives of everyone else aboard the vessel, she meets her own unfortunate death in the disastrous crash.</p>
<p>This is very bad news for the survivors: the bio-drive of the spacecraft requires a very specific DNA sequence for its symbiotic reactors to work. While they know perfectly well that they would never find another pilot of the same species of the deceased on Terra, they decide to attempt an hybridization process, by transplanting key organs for the drive into a live human female. While Lobo and RevC2 keep assessing the damage on the ship and deal with ""minor"" crises, the Captain sets out to find a suitable candidate for pilot replacement.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1538663016/rcbknmb5xutf6f6shair.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Herma Greta is a young, aspiring singer who loves and lives to rock out. However, her career has not been so lucky. She's changed many bands that wouldn't take her seriously; she's fallen prey of unscrupulous managers and shady record company executives - and after so many years of trying to break into the music business, she's just about to give up.</p>
<p>Little does she know that destiny is about to put her on a path that will lead her - literally - to the stars! Abducted and taken aboard the ship, she is to be implanted with alien organs and bionic parts and become the new pilot of the BFS9000.</p>
<p>Lobo has been working together with Big Daddy for as long as he can remember. The ship is the only home he's ever known. It's a lifestyle that takes its on toll on the best of 'em, but Lobo is no ordinary Berserker! He knows both the game and the players very well, and he can take care of pretty much every situation... the Lobo way!</p>
<p>But still, he remains very surprised to discover that after the landing on Terra, some of the spores collected from many corners of the galaxy have sprouted into some kind of cute, sentient flower-like being. Lobo likes it very much, and starts carrying the ""thing"" around with him, much like a pirate with a parrot in the olden days...</p>
<p>But peril lurks at any corner: besides the hardships of being on a strange planet, Denib, a dangerous inter-dimensional criminal, manages to flee its containment cage, and it will be up to Lobo to face this critical, psychotropic threat.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Confederation minion ARC, a reptilian hunter with an army of war drones is following the tracks that lead to the wreckage of the BFS9000 - to exact hiss revenge on Big Daddy and its crew.</p>
<p>While Herma struggles with her new reality, confrontations will come to a climactic close, as the different story-lines merge into one. There will be blood. Lots of blood. Some will die, some will feed.</p>
<p>But for those who'll live to see the day, the adventure is only just begun...</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>This project is for an All-Ages Coloring book of Junior High Horrors, the first ever all-ages horror parody that Robert Kirkman may have called ""Awesome,"" from creator Rob Potchak and series artist Eric Kent. Our entry video is from Rob's appearance on ABC'S LOCALISH where they showed off Junior High Horrors as the first ever Dyslexia Friendly Comic Series.</p>
<p>Junior High Horrors is the first ever All-Ages Horror Parody, allowing parents the opportunity to let their kids have something ""horror"" without having to worry about the content.

<p>We are looking to deliver a 32 page coloring book at 8.5X11 inches in size, depicting scenes from your favorite issues of Keenspot's series, Junior High Horrors.

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We already have the commitment from the other artists and the cover artwork and all of the pages from Potchak and Kent are already completed and formatted for book, so we are waiting on the art from the guest contributors to have the book ready to deliver to the printer. </p>
<p>What we are looking for is the funding to get it to the printer, take care of the printing and shipping costs, as well as the costs of the labor for the project from the team working on the project.</p>
<p>Perks depending on tier will include:</p>
<p>-PDF version of the coloring book so you can print out the pages to color over and over again, </p>
<p>-Physical copy of the Coloring book, both unsigned and signed versions will be available</p>
<p>- Unique sketch cards drawn by Potchak or Kent of your favorite JHH Characters</p>
<p>- Unique drawings of YOU as a character in the style of Junior High Horrors</p>
<p>- Stickers and Enamel Pins</p>
<p>- Original art pages from the book</p>
<p>- Custom merchandise ONLY available through this campaign</p>
<p>-Retailer only tiers that allow discounted copies of the coloring book so they can sell the books at a profit themselves, and possibly some stretch goals like retailer only cover.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We have delivered 8 comics over two years and in that time, there was very little profit for Junior High Horrors, yet we know we have a very loyal fanbase. The contributions for this coloring book would allow us to continue to deliver more Junior High Horrors stories and allow these kids stories to continue, while delivering on the promise of making all the issues Dyslexia Friendly.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As stated above, our challenge isn't getting this book to the loyal fanbase of Junior High Horrors, as most of the book is completed and very little worry is there. There is more challenge to continuing to write and draw the regular Junior High Horrors comics, as the profit margins are very minute compared to the amount of time, work and effort that goes into creating each issue of the comic. </p>
<p>The risks are also very low. We have delivered 10 books without missing a deadline on getting it to the publisher on time, and stake our reputations on that. </p>
<p>The only other risk/challenge presented is having the project printed and shipped on time in this current pandemic filled climate.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We know our fanbase is loyal, and we are just asking that you help get the word out. Share links to our campaign, tell middle school teachers and libraries about the project and ask that they help in any way they can. </p>
</div></div>","Short Summary
This project is for an All-Ages Coloring book of Junior High Horrors, the first ever all-ages horror parody that Robert Kirkman may have called ""Awesome,"" from creator Rob Potchak and series artist Eric Kent. Our entry video is from Rob's appearance on ABC'S LOCALISH where they showed off Junior High Horrors as the first ever Dyslexia Friendly Comic Series.
Junior High Horrors is the first ever All-Ages Horror Parody, allowing parents the opportunity to let their kids have something ""horror"" without having to worry about the content. The horror of JHH is that it literally IS kids going through the pains of middle school and all that entails. It just helps that the characters are recognizable to adults, too, as are the easter eggs throughout the books. Junior High Horrors also became the first comic book ever to be ""Dyslexia Friendly,"" using open source dyslexia friendly fonts to help those struggling with dyslexia to distinguish the difference between similar letters (see attached video)

Not limited to garden-variety prehistoric creatures, (Sam) Glanzman created a fever dream of surreal, horrific monstrosities.""–The Comics Journal  ""The whole thing heaves and pulsates like the ink itself has come down with a strange and maddening fever. As (Sam) Glanzman is such a fine craftsman there's a grace and beauty to what's unfolding in every single shift in perspective and each flash of outright visual madness. Boy, what a thrill.""–Comics Reporter  ""Jungle lord Kona, along with Dr. Dodd and his family, explore jungle worlds of savage apes, sabre-toothed tigers, and primitive tribes in this high-octane adventure comic. Artist Sam Glanzman fills each panel and page with lush detail and action in the best tradition of Tarzan, and the story-line feeds up enough action and adventure for any fan of Edgar Rice Burroughs.""–Atomic Avenue KONA #2 standard cover by Sam Glanzman KONA #2 variant cover by Thomas Yeates & Stephen R. Bissette WELCOME to the campaign to publish KONA #2...issue two of the weirdest, wildest comic ever published!  KONA: MONARCH OF MONSTER ISLE tells the story of a strange hero known only as Kona, saving the lives of Dr. Henry Dodd, his daughter Mary, and his grandchildren Mason and Lily, after this group crashes their army surplus blimp on the prehistoric Pacific island that Kona calls home.  Befriending them, Kona becomes their protector, saving them from giant animals, monsters and much more!  Originally published in 1962, this series has never been collected or reprinted until now! This issue features a variant cover by comic book masters Thomas Yeates & Stephen R. Bissette.  This issue also has a pin-up by Thomas Yeates & Al Williamson.  And don't forget that each issue contains an essay about KONA and Sam Glanzman by Stephen R. Bissette! Pin-up tribute to Sam Glanzman by Thomas Yeates & Al Williamson This issue has both limited edition covers, and standard covers.  The  limited edition covers by both Sam Glanzman and Thomas Yeates & Stephen R. Bissette will be on card-stock with a beautiful matte finish, and will ONLY be available from this campaign! There are also covers available signed by both Stephen R. Bissette & Thomas Yeates!The variant cover this month is a mind-blowing collaborative effort by Thomas Yeates and Stephen R. Bissette.  Yeates is responsible for the image of Kona, and Bissette the background of monsters and dinosaurs.  In fact, as you can see below, his ""background"" was so incredibly detailed that I decided to use it for this issue's back cover. KONA #2 back cover by Stephen R. Bissette For those who missed our last campaign, you can pick up both covers from KONA #1 (seen below) by Sam Glanzman and fan-favorite Bart Sears. KONA #1 standard cover by Sam Glanzman KONA #1 variant cover by Bart Sears KONA: MONARCH OF MONSTER ISLE was originally published in 1962, and therefore needs to be fully restored.  We are lucky to have the brilliant Allan Harvey restoring each page of this incredible comic book series.  Below are some samples of the work he is currently doing on this second issue. KONA #2 restoration sample #1 KONA #2 restoration sample #2 KONA #2 restoration sample #3 As many of you know, I have worked very hard for several years to bring the incredible work of comic book master Sam Glanzman back into print.  Collections I have edited and/or published include A Sailor's Story, U.S.S. Stevens: The Collected Stories, ATTU, Red Range: A Wild Western Adventure (with Joe R. Lansdale), Voyage to the Deep, and (coming soon) The Lonely War of Capt. Willy Schultz (with Will Franz). We were even lucky enough to receive an Eisner Award nomination for the U.S.S. Stevens collection by Glanzman that I edited, which contains true stories about his time serving in the Pacific Theater during WWII.  But aside from his war comics, KONA might just contain some of the most incredible pages that Glanzman ever illustrated.  I can't wait to get KONA back into print for both long time fans to enjoy, and a whole new generation to discover!  Your support will ensure this incredible -and historically important- comic book series lives on for years to come!#SamGlanzmanForever #LongLiveKona #LongLiveComicsDrew Ford (Publisher, IT'S ALIVE!)",15.0,0,"29 Campaigns

Over the last 7 years of working as a published comic artist I have had the desire to pay forward the wonderful opportunity of seeing my work published to other comic book creators. Additionally I've met some truly fantastic comic storytellers that just need someone to believe in them and their stories. All of these are my reasons for creating Vivifica Studios. </span><br/>
</h3>
<p>'The Midnight Candle anthology' was an idea that was conceptualized out my desire to start giving creators that chance to get their work published. I have been published in a few anthologies myself and I wanted to share the joy of that collaboration with other creators. When editor Dana Skvarek and I threw this idea out there to a few forums and Facebook we had no idea how many people would even want to be a part of our dream. We were soon overwhelmed with submissions and were very excited to see this project take shape. </p>
<p>The Midnight Candle Anthology is a Horror graphic novel consisting of over 13+ comic stories and 20+ creators. Many of these creators are from all over the U.S.A and a few in other places of the world. For a few of these creators this is a very big chance to get that publishing credit to their names as well as the sheer joy of seeing their work in print. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Digital comics and books are excellent, but there's nothing quite like the feel of paper between your fingers. And printing those pages costs money, so let's break it down:</p> <ul> <li>Our printer, Artist Express can get our books printed, packed, and on our door step for just under $1,000. </li> <li>For contributing to our campaign, you can get the book digitally, printed, even get some cool artist swag to go along with it all, depending on the level you choose!</li>
<li>Your name, First name and last initial, will be listed in the book! </li> <li style=""text-align: left;"">Crowd funding is great, but it's a risk, and sometimes risks don't pay off. In the event we DON'T reach our goal, we'll still work to make good on our promise to deliver to each and everyone of you that supported us. The delivery date might have to be adjusted, though. </li> </ul>

</div></div>","My name is Jolene and I am a comic book artist who has been published in books ranging from small comic publishers to bigger ones like IDW. Over the last 7 years of working as a published comic artist I have had the desire to pay forward the wonderful opportunity of seeing my work published to other comic book creators. Additionally I've met some truly fantastic comic storytellers that just need someone to believe in them and their stories. All of these are my reasons for creating Vivifica Studios. 

'The Midnight Candle anthology' was an idea that was conceptualized out my desire to start giving creators that chance to get their work published. I have been published in a few anthologies myself and I wanted to share the joy of that collaboration with other creators. When editor Dana Skvarek and I threw this idea out there to a few forums and Facebook we had no idea how many people would even want to be a part of our dream. We were soon overwhelmed with submissions and were very excited to see this project take shape. 
The Midnight Candle Anthology is a Horror graphic novel consisting of over 13+ comic stories and 20+ creators. Many of these creators are from all over the U.S.A and a few in other places of the world. For a few of these creators this is a very big chance to get that publishing credit to their names as well as the sheer joy of seeing their work in print. 
This is where you come in.  







What We Need & What You Get Digital comics and books are excellent, but there's nothing quite like the feel of paper between your fingers. And printing those pages costs money, so let's break it down:  Our printer, Artist Express can get our books printed, packed, and on our door step for just under $1,000.  For contributing to our campaign, you can get the book digitally, printed, even get some cool artist swag to go along with it all, depending on the level you choose!
Your name, First name and last initial, will be listed in the book!  Crowd funding is great, but it's a risk, and sometimes risks don't pay off. In the event we DON'T reach our goal, we'll still work to make good on our promise to deliver to each and everyone of you that supported us. The delivery date might have to be adjusted, though.  




  

The Impact Ever drop a penny into a charity collection box at your favorite hip coffee shop? You know you're helping, but you don't know how. With us the results are right in front of you the whole time!  We want you to be a part of the success of printing a graphic novel. Let's face it, don't you want the bragging rights when you show off YOUR fancy shmancy book to your friends and can prove you helped get it made? Unlike a Hollywood movie campaign, ours is truly grass roots. We CAN'T do this without you! Even if we could, we wouldn't want to! It's lonely at the top, let's get there together! 




   


Risks & Challenges  Every campaign has it's risks, and this one certainly isn't without a few.   We have a minimum number of books we have to print, and so we have to hit a minimum amount of contributions. But we're not worried, we have you on our side! Like we mentioned before, if we don't hit our goal there are other options, but they're not pretty. AND those options will delay printing overall, and delay getting your awesome book into your awesome hands.

<p>The first book in this comic book series tells the story of a girl who learned to love herself through adversity. She had a lot of bad things happen to her, which left her trapped in a cage of fear, guilt, and shame. Eventually, she decided to stop being a victim and start fighting back.</p>
<p>She learned that everything happens for a reason, but really, only you get to decide the meaning behind the events of your life. She decided to give her life meaning by becoming a super hero, to empower other victims of violence, and then, of course, write a comic book about it!</p>

<p><b>Q. I can get a book on my Kindle for $0.99. Why should I pay $35 for a comic book?</b></p>
<p>A. This is more than just a comic book! It's a really long comic book. It's 250 pages of full color art! For one thing, color printing is very expensive, so the book costs more than a normal book with just words does.<span><br/></span><span><span><br/></span>Secondly, you're not only paying for the book, but all the time I've invested into research, writing, rewriting, rewriting again, and drawing the book. It takes a lot more time to make a graphic novel than it would for just a normal Kindle book.<span><br/></span><span><span><br/></span>Thirdly, you're paying for quality. I put my whole heart and soul into this book, and I love what I'm doing. The book is a piece of my soul, and thus priced accordingly. I'm selling my soul to you rather than to the Devil himself. (Don't worry, that was never an option. Just a joke!)<span><br/></span></span></span></p>

<p>This is the name of the fourth track on my album. I wanted to combine themes of very heated sexuality, with the brunette on the barstool, one half of the center piece, playing the appearance of the femme fatale. I visualized the characters in a glass of Hennessy  and coca-cola. Hence the figures having bubbles fizz around them as they make their descent to the bottom of the glass.</p>

The fatigue and endless cycle of same'ol, same 'ol feeling like there was no escape for a period of time. A endless loop.  I even make a reference to the song ""Hotel California"", a song by the group known as ""The Eagles"", that has a similar vibe on the subject.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492630400/rgdecxst9dcpv3ncglbv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3> </h3><h3> </h3><h3><a href=""https://superkingarmor.bandcamp.com/track/knights-in-shining-darkness"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">KNIGHTS IN SHINING DARKNESS</a></h3><p>This is the name of the eleventh track from my album.

This song is about my high level of empathy and the internal protection I need to safeguard myself.

<h3><strong>Short Summary</strong></h3>
</div><p>My name is Enrae Mercer, but I go by the stage name Super King Armor. I am a hip hop artist from Queens, New York. I started a small indie label named 8th Rank Records, and have put out two music projects. The first being a 7 track Ep titled the ""<a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/werewolf-lullabies/id424568721"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Werewolf Lullabies</a>"". The second being my full length album titled ""<a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/gone-is-the-illusion/id982769238"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Gone is the illusion</a>"". Now I am venturing into new territory by publishing my first illustration book! I have my letterer (That's the person who puts the text with any pictures in the book). I'm doing offset printing, which means I will be printing in bulk. A total of 500 copies are going to press! For those of you who prefer an E-book, there will be one too!  To see my vision come to life take a look at some of the images featured in the book below with links to the music that was inspired by it!</p><h2> </h2><h2><u><strong>NOT A DREAM, BUT REALITY</strong></u></h2><p>So why the campaign? Here's the deal. I've been in love with comic books forever. I remember very fondly in my childhood memories my grandmother walking me home from school and stopping by the local bodega and seeing all these comic books on a laundry line and begging her to buy me some. She eventually did and that's where my journey with drawing began. All I wanted to do was draw for Marvel or DC comics back then. So now years later, to be publishing my own book, it still hasn't sunk in what I'm about to accomplish. Very few things catch me off guard and make me feel giddy. This! Is one of those things.</p><p>The whole process of getting to this point is also a big deal for me. What started as just doing the front and back cover to my album <a href=""https://superkingarmor.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Gone is the illusion</a> which was a big deal in itself because I had never published any art to the world like that. Especially with my music. It gave me a tremendous surge that spoke to me, and said, if you can get this far...How much farther could you go? And I went farther, and I finished it! Now All I need is the funds to produce it!</p><div>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div><div><ul></ul></div><div>
<ul><li>It's important for me to release this book to prove not only to myself but to other aspiring artists of any medium that you can create your own world without being hindered by someone else's small perception of it. Especially when you know somebody who's successfully done it. Through that display of strength I also wanted to show balance to it by placing the themes of isolation, and introspection in my art work. Those being  two of the dominant themes you experience when laying the groundwork of your individuality.</li></ul>
<ul><li> Each time I set out to accomplish a goal I've reached it. As a musician I was successful in putting out my album 'Gone Is The Illusion', because I was detail oriented in my approach to it. I obtained copyrights to all the lyrics from my album, I started my own publishing company. I set up distribution on multiple channels. The first and major one was CD Baby which distributed my album to itunes, spotify, amazon, Google play, emusic, and multiple other independent digital music purchase sites. Too further cover my bases I put my music on bandcamp, a site that's not in CDbaby's package of digital and physical distribution. Now I approach this project with the same detail and focus. As obvious as it sounds, I can only put my all into things I care about. This illustration book being an extension of my album gets the same.</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul><li>To reach my goals I will utilize my extensive network of people that are fans of my music as well as those who have previewed my artwork and are anticipating the release of my book. What's important to me is reaching out to people individually and through my email list. I've also made contact with people face to face recently that I've known for years but hadn't seen in awhile and are excited to contribute. I believe that the only true obstacle I face is that there is only one of me, and I can only do so much. As much as I'd like to believe that's not true, having a network, and people sharing the campaign with their friends and family really speeds up the process of completion.</li></ul>

</div><h3> </h3><ul></ul><h3> </h3><ul></ul><div><p> </p></div></div>","HENNY ON ICE
This is the name of the fourth track on my album. I wanted to combine themes of very heated sexuality, with the brunette on the barstool, one half of the center piece, playing the appearance of the femme fatale. I visualized the characters in a glass of Hennessy  and coca-cola. Hence the figures having bubbles fizz around them as they make their descent to the bottom of the glass.
  GROUNDHOG'S DAYThis is the name of the thirteenth track off my album. This drawing I channeled from my experience of living with my family before, and after I was homeless. The fatigue and endless cycle of same'ol, same 'ol feeling like there was no escape for a period of time. A endless loop.  I even make a reference to the song ""Hotel California"", a song by the group known as ""The Eagles"", that has a similar vibe on the subject.  KNIGHTS IN SHINING DARKNESSThis is the name of the eleventh track from my album. This illustration is a tribute to one of my all time favorite artists, Mike Mignola. Famous for creating ""Hell Boy"". With the heavy shadows, old world conventional warfare, ancient body armor, and cultures with these minimalist backgrounds. This song is about my high level of empathy and the internal protection I need to safeguard myself. Hence the Knights in the shadows.  There will be a Japanese translation of the book!I have the amazing opportunity to have my book translated in Japanese! Below are pictures of my artwork being used on a flyer for a punk rock show thrown by my friend Fran Powers, who lives in Okinawa Japan, which is where these photos are from. The image is from a flyer I designed that I am also offering as one of the perks in this campaign. To see the flyer just scroll past the photos below and you will see. My buddy Fran's wife is doing the translation for the book, once that's done I will have my letterer put that to the version of the book.These two photos are taken from the streets of Okinawa, In its capital of Naha, on it's main street called Kokusai Dori. Which is like Times Sq, in NYC.This is the original flyer where the image was taken from. My music live and direct!!The video below is from birthday show performance, that also celebrated the completion of the drawings to my illustration book, and preview to my graphic novel titled'4' that is in the works. The song being performed is ""Knights in shining darkness"", sound familiar? This was at Leftfield Bar, in Lower Manhattan, on a Saturday night. I rocked this song over live beatmaking, through a program called ""Ableton"" provided by P.Cruz, one half of the rap duo known as 'Punskription'. This photo was taken post rehearsals at Funkadelic Studios in Midtown Manhattan, with P.Cruz who is the live beatmaker in the video above during my Bday Artwork Preview show. This was part of the level of preparation I put into to get that show off the ground. Not only do I draw on paper but I am also the canvas for artwork. At all my shows I wear face paint. Most times I do it myself but in the case of this picture I had a face paint artist by the name of Niazja Blessed Rios do the honors.On one occasion, I even used my talents to win free food at Five Guys in Midtown Manhattan one night. In this pic I'm holding the free burger while pointing to the drawing that I posted on their board. This was the drawing I did and of course I had to  do some self promotion. Always get the word out about my work is a must.I always find a place for my self expression, in this case on the mask I wear right before I hit the stage for all my shows when I reveal the face paint underneath. Face paint, guns out! LOL. I truly feel free the less clothes I am wearing on stage. Step by Step process  of how I execute artworkIf you've ever wondered how I conjure up all the drawings I did for the illustration book. I've added videos below of the step by step process of how I did a mural of Marvels Deadpool and other Marvel characters for a friend of mines son. The finish product went on the wall in his room.

<p>​With your help I can produce many more covers, issues, and be able to get to a convention near you with all these awesome books. Every penny raised goes towards making Issue 2 of Icepick a reality.

All profits will go toward funding future stories and making sure I am at shows meeting and greeting you, the fans! </p>
<p>Think of your pledge as a sneak peek or a pre-purchase. I’ve put together several rewards that I hope you'll love. Plus any of the rewards make a great gift for anyone in your family!</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>When it comes to shipping on time and reward fulfillment, any project can have obstacles. Most of the perks (including possible Stretch Goal incentives) are standing by to print, as most of the creative is complete. My printers are ready to go as soon as I give them word! I have worked with these printers before and they deliver the top notch books and rewards you’ll be receiving, this you can count on. If there are any hiccups or delays I will be in constant communication with all backers during the entire process and update you in a timely manner.</p>
<p>I want to assure you that making the best and highest quality products possible and having them delivered to you in a timely and undamaged way is my top priority. </p>

Icepick is a character whose story that I have wanted to publish since I was a kid. Over the years I have revised and cleaned up the story to make it something more than just a kid wanting to make a comic book. It started with issue 1 which I painstakingly funded and published myself. 
With your help I can publish issue 2 and also get out there to meet you the fans!
