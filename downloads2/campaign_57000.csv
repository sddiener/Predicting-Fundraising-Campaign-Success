<p><strong>360° SONIC BRUSHING</strong> - the new innovative way to clean all your teeth at the same time.  If you brush your teeth for 2 minutes, each tooth is getting less than 6 seconds of attention.  With the ULU, each tooth will receive the full 30 seconds.  It even has a built in timer so you know when you’re done. The brush heads are made of food-grade silicone specially designed for maximum cleaning power with up to 4 times more bristles and cleaning nodes than the others.</p>
<p><strong>MASSAGING</strong> - The American Dental Association promotes massaging gums to help with blood flow.  Increased blood flow to gums has been shown to allow the tissue to repair itself more effectively and be less susceptible to the effects of gingivitis and periodontitis.  Massaging the gums also can loosens and remove debris from the periodontal pocket. Plaque and food particles are then easier to clear away.</p>

<p><strong>ORTHODONTIC ACCELERATOR</strong> - the mode is only available with the ULU Brush Plus. It is a 10 minute mode with pulsating cycles of 3 second vibrations. Run it twice for the recommended 20 minutes a day. Studies shows to greatly alleviate the pain and discomfort associated with orthodontic treatment up to 70%. It uses gentle, precise micro-pulses that are transmitted through teeth to the surrounding bone to increase cellular activity to allow teeth to move quicker, which accelerates invisalign or traditional braces up to 50% faster.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The ultimate goal - your long term happy feet</h3>

<p>It is up to you now to decide your long term treating attitude to your feet, to feel good about that and whether you want to make a difference.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">A little science lesson!</h3>
<p>According to The Institute for Preventive Foot Health:</p>
<ul>
<li>The average foot contains 600 sweat glands per square centimeter – <a data-saferedirecturl=""https://www.google.com/url?q=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-2494.2007.00387.x/pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1559305768639000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGDqDW3Uno-LmnkLcbjN-ye2a2R9Q"" href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-2494.2007.00387.x/pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hundreds more than the armpits</a>.</li>
<li>In one day, each foot can produce half a pint of sweat.</li>
<li>The main reason for bad feet odor is caused by natural bacteria on your feet or worst by fungus bacteria.</li>
<li>The two feet together have more than 250,000 sweat glands, and they release perspiration even during periods of non-vigorous activities</li>
<li>That said, odor is not caused by perspiration alone; it results from the acid byproducts of bacteria, as well as fungal growth (usually athlete’s foot fungus, tinea pedis), which are found in sweaty feet.</li>
</ul>
<p>So the underlying reason for most cases of smelly feet is bacteria and moisture. When the bacteria rid themselves of wastes from breaking down oils and dead skin cells, bad smells can result.</p>
<p>Fungal infections of the feet like athlete's foot can lead to bad foot odor.</p>
<p>In so many cases our feet are in socks and in shoes large proportion or shorter but more active period of the day time.</p>
<p>Following this the choice of materials - bamboo and silver - becomes obvious</p>
<p><strong>Silver</strong> has many unique qualities such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>kills 99.9% of bacteria</li>
<li>antibacterial</li>
<li>antiseptic</li>
<li>hypoallergenic</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bamboo</strong> also has many great qualities as it is:</p>
<ul>
<li>breathable</li>
<li>soft</li>
<li>eco-friendly</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564472800/bv7nkqcfrgf1oneqf05m.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>You can be sure that we have been into socks for quite a while and that is why with great pleasure we want to share with you our experience wearing <strong>Highku Socks</strong>.</p>
<p>And before that you might want to hear how was the tests made. Yes, we have tested Highku silver socks the hardcore way:</p>
<ul>
<li>in the gym, office, running, dancing, hiking,... you name it;</li>
<li>of course from winter through summer;</li>
<li>men and women;</li>
<li>with washing and without washing.</li>
</ul>
<p>So back to the points:</p>
<ol>
<li>Highku silver socks can keep you safe from odor and bad bacteria up to 7 days straight. Just because we are all unique in our own way, we had some who could wear one pair of Highku silver socks without washing for over a month and at the same time some hard case people, who managed to go for 2 days. Anyway it is up to each individual and chemistry so that is why we do recommend to change socks every day.</li>
<li>Just because every foot is different in it's own way, for example foot may have some blisters, lump, pimple or something else like that, there is possibility that depreciation of the socks might not be even. It could appear and be more in previously mentioned areas.</li>
<li>Only you can control overall logical things to do and good principles of using your footwear along with your Highku silver socks, like always wearing clean from dirt socks and footwear, make sure you cut and file your nails, take care of your feet skin, especially heel part skin so it's soft and see your doctor if you feel your feet might have some illness.</li>
</ol>

You  are only required to pay attention to your socks once - when you choose your Highku Sock. The rest is up to them.
We strive to make a meaningful difference in peoples lives starting from the very bottom with a very fundamental meaning.
We believe it is good to live in society that values feeling good and health care is a long term priority. Highku silver socks embodies the best of all you need on your feet.

The ultimate goal - your long term happy feet
Lets be clear about the funding here. We have spent more than a year in research and developing, testing and even more testing. That is why you are invited to participate at the very important moment - it is up to you to decide and to let Highku Silver Socks to the production. With your help we plan to raise USD 3,500 and we would like to be 100% transparent where your money ends up:

~8% goes for Indiegogo, bank transfer and other type of fees;
~15% goes for shipping costs;
~77% goes for manufacturing and packaging the Highku silver socks.

We offer to you something to what we have dedicated 100% effort, time, energy and pretty much everything else what was needed. With that being said you might see why Highku Silver Socks embodies only the best you need.
It is up to you now to decide your long term treating attitude to your feet, to feel good about that and whether you want to make a difference.
A little science lesson!
According to The Institute for Preventive Foot Health:

The average foot contains 600 sweat glands per square centimeter – hundreds more than the armpits.
In one day, each foot can produce half a pint of sweat.
The main reason for bad feet odor is caused by natural bacteria on your feet or worst by fungus bacteria.
The two feet together have more than 250,000 sweat glands, and they release perspiration even during periods of non-vigorous activities
That said, odor is not caused by perspiration alone; it results from the acid byproducts of bacteria, as well as fungal growth (usually athlete’s foot fungus, tinea pedis), which are found in sweaty feet.

So the underlying reason for most cases of smelly feet is bacteria and moisture. When the bacteria rid themselves of wastes from breaking down oils and dead skin cells, bad smells can result.
Fungal infections of the feet like athlete's foot can lead to bad foot odor.
In so many cases our feet are in socks and in shoes large proportion or shorter but more active period of the day time.
Following this the choice of materials - bamboo and silver - becomes obvious
Silver has many unique qualities such as:

kills 99.9% of bacteria
antibacterial
antiseptic
hypoallergenic

Bamboo also has many great qualities as it is:

breathable
soft
eco-friendly


You can be sure that we have been into socks for quite a while and that is why with great pleasure we want to share with you our experience wearing Highku Socks.
And before that you might want to hear how was the tests made. Yes, we have tested Highku silver socks the hardcore way:

in the gym, office, running, dancing, hiking,... you name it;
of course from winter through summer;
men and women;
with washing and without washing.

So back to the points:

Highku silver socks can keep you safe from odor and bad bacteria up to 7 days straight. Just because we are all unique in our own way, we had some who could wear one pair of Highku silver socks without washing for over a month and at the same time some hard case people, who managed to go for 2 days. Anyway it is up to each individual and chemistry so that is why we do recommend to change socks every day.
Just because every foot is different in it's own way, for example foot may have some blisters, lump, pimple or something else like that, there is possibility that depreciation of the socks might not be even. It could appear and be more in previously mentioned areas.
Only you can control overall logical things to do and good principles of using your footwear along with your Highku silver socks, like always wearing clean from dirt socks and footwear, make sure you cut and file your nails, take care of your feet skin, especially heel part skin so it's soft and see your doctor if you feel your feet might have some illness.


By supporting us you might reduce some unexpected events like skip the embarrassment of smelly feet. And even if your feet do not smell, they still deserve to be treated well.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p><i>Chill Powder</i> is the brainchild and proprietary Patent Pending intellectual property of Dr. Beth Fisher, Ph.D. (Indiana 1999), President of New View LLC (parent company to Chill Brands) a Nevada corporation. Dr. Beth and her woman-led team created odorless, tasteless healthy-living dietary supplement powders without utilizing any harsh solvents in the process.</p>
<p>These powders were created for Dr. Beth's patients, friends and family to use and are now commercially available through our strategic partners in Nevada and California as well as on dedicated websites, Amazon and select big box stores across the USA.</p>
<p>Dr. Beth (as she is known) spent a lifetime teaching special needs children, adults and those who teach those populations. Dr. Beth has expertise in cognitive disorders and the application of cannabinoids to physiological and cognitive maladies and is an expert in this field.</p>
<p>Dr. Beth is also a published author, radio show and podcast host, researcher, celebrity chef, and a fierce warrior for women's rights and in the fight to end cannabinoid deficiency subsequent to Prohibition in the United States.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dr. Beth and her team are passionate about CBD and ""LOC's"" (Lessor Occurring Cannabinoids) and have a century of combined experience in the production and application of cannabinoids.</li>
<li>Chill Powder products are fabricated by her woman-owned and woman-run team.</li>
<li>All of our products are Vegan, Halal, Kosher, Sugar-Free, diabetic-friendly, odorless and tasteless unless we add natural flavorings.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>Chill Powder has already lifted off the launchpad after years of preparation and now we need a small boost to achieve orbit. Once our products are available in single servings SKU's we will be able to place them in doctor's offices, health food stores, nutrition centers, Yoga studios and into big box stores. </li>
<li>We Licensed our proprietary IP for the recreational cannabis market in Nevada in 2017.</li>
<li>Chill Powder then Licensed the state of California in 2018 to the largest purveyor of cannabis flower in that market.</li>
<li>2019 saw New View LLC and Chill Powder fulfill almost 7.5 million dollars worth of contractual obligations and now it's time to bring everyone the benefits of the lessor occurring cannabinoids like CBD, CBG, CBN and over one hundred other cannabinoids which are currently being studied in the USA and abroad.</li>
<li>Our CBD line is ready to go and if this campaign is a success we will begin to release other cannabinoid iterations such as CBG as the science becomes available if we do not reach our goal we will widen distribution on our CBD line only for now.</li>
<li>There is nothing like it anywhere! There are a few other cannabinoid powders out there but they are isolates made with harsh chemicals or powders made with solvents we feel are unsafe and inappropriate. Chill Powder sources and uses only the purist USA oils STRIPPED OF ALL THC. Zero solvents or chemicals are used in the process. With Chill Powder products you get purity, potency, and peace of mind.</li>

<h3>Purity, Potency, Professionalism</h3>
<p><strong>YOUR</strong><i> contribution could make a difference! Chill Powder products are gaining traction in a number of markets and once available in single-serving SKU's a number of new vendors will begin to aggressively market Chill Powder and products derived from the CP technology.</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Although not sold for medical purposes we have customers around the country reporting humbling personal stories of breakthroughs with Crohn's, chronic pain, epilepsy and more...</li>
<li>In eighteen months we took Chill Powder from creation to market and a 7.5 mm dollar contract with the largest company of its type in CA.</li>
<li>This is NOT a job to us, it is our life's work and our calling.</li>
<li>Chill Powder makes a positive difference in the world and we only wish to continue.</li>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p><strong>Education is the key.</strong> Chill Powder products create a whole new way to consume cannabinoids, <i>without smoking</i>. </p>
<p>Elder populations are unlikely to engage in smoking if they have not done so previously so new methods of consuming cannabinoids and micro-dosing are essential in order to share in the benefits of CBD and other LOC's (lessor occurring cannabinoids) with elderly populations.</p>
<p><strong><i>The legal landscape has changed dramatically subsequent to the passage of the 2018 USA Farm Bill that makes the sale of all hemp-derived products, such as CBD, CBG, etc legal but there remain legislative challenges, especially in smaller municipalities.</i></strong></p>

For those backing at the early bird price of $99 or for the $110 price, we will be sending you a unit. So the money you pledge will go towards paying for the master prototype as well as making sure you actually get to own Pal as soon as possible. Additionally for those who might not be able to support us at the full cost of the unit, we still want to be able to give you a discount code for the future purchase of Pal once it hits retail, and  as a special thank you to those backing at the $30 and $50 options we have special perks for you.The remainder of the money we are seeking goes towards shipping logistics and insurance. ChallengesWe have been working on this project for the past 3 years and that includes meetings and discussions with shipping companies, production companies, prototyping specialists, accountants, lawyers, entrepreneurs and even government officials. We are taking this, our first independent project very seriously.We already have the finer details accounted for and we are ready to get Pal to you.Our biggest hurdle is getting the master prototype finished ahead of mass production. Having worked on a previous crowdfunding campaign, we are sure we will be able to reach enough persons who can see the benefit of owning and gifting Pal. That having been said, if we fail to reach our funding goal, we will try again with your feedback on why you think we failed. Anything you can do to help, we appreciate!We understand that many people might understand what Pal represents and want to support us but might not be able to. That's okay! Simply taking the time to share our campaign with anyone who you think might benefit from owning a Pal or might know someone who would will help us greatly so go ahead, tell your friends, family, colleagues, even your favourite barista :)Many thanks, truly.Thanks for reading (or scrolling) all the way down to this point. The team is humbled by you giving our project a once over. And if you decide to back us and share with your loved ones, we thank you even more. All the best for the holiday season and the New Year!Thanks and respect,Steve, Cheryl and Roland",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>My cat really doesn't like to play</b></p>
<p>...”She doesn't really like to play with toys,” “She liked to play when she was a kitten, but now that she’s older, she just prefers to eat and sleep.” But this isn't exactly true because a cat's mental health depends on the amount of exercise and hunting activities.

We can tell from our experience that there is nothing a cat owner wouldn't do for their pets to keep them happy. RollyCat is a smart and innovative cat toy:



When you're not around, RollyCat will start playing with your cat automatically.RollyCat gives valuable information about your cat's health. It's monitoring your cats’s daily activity, by tracking their play time.Thanks to smartphone control playing is fun for both you and your cat. RollyCat is acting like real prey, learning to react to your cats unique play styles. 

""A cat toy with a soul"" - John Catpenter, New York Cat""
Wow, I'm amazed, it's such a relief to our community"" - Marcus Catford,  CEO at Hunt Your Own Food Inc.


THE PERFECT TOY FOR ANY CAT





RollyCat offers countless possibilities, by mimicking the movement of real prey and learning to react to your cats unique play styles



RollyCat understands the psychology behind cats' hunting behaviours and encourages cat's natural instincts to chase and catch prey. 
Cats like to sneak up on prey and and then pounce. RollyCat reacts to being hunted by trying to escape. It's a safe way to make sure your cat stays on top of it's game. Its varying difficulty levels will stimulate and challenge your cat, even as their skills improve.

AUTOMATIC PLAY MODE

RollyCat will start playing with your cat automatically when you're not around







Just set RollyCat free on the floor when you leave and have your cat go after it. 
It will react to cat’s movements by trying to escape and hide - just like real prey. Only smart toys provide the mental and physical stimulation needed for cats.
Solitary cats often invent ways to occupy their minds, like tearing up cloth scraps, unrolling tissue all over the house, picking at cardboard boxes, you name it.Often times cat's left home alone have nothing else to do, besides eating. Lack of proper stimulation is the most common cause of
mental and physical problems for cats. 
MANUAL PLAY MODE


RollyCat is fun for both you and your cat. By using your
smartphone as a controller your cat will never find out who's really
controlling the ball.




Ready for some high-tech cat entertainment? Watch your cat trying to outsmart RollyCat (or is it the other way around?). Watching your kitty play can give you an insight into the mysterious and rich personality of cats. HEALTH AND FITNESS TRACKER
RollyCat monitors your cat’s everyday activity, awarding health and happiness points for the playing time. 

Everyone knows it's important for a cat to be active to stay healthy but with today’s busy lifestyle it can be difficult to find enough time for play. Right now, there's no easy way to make sure if your cat gets enough exercise. What is he doing when no one is at home? This is where RollyCat can help. Built-in sensors measure how much and at what intensity your cat played during the day. So you'll know if your cat needs a little extra exercise.Its mobile app monitors different health trends providing insights into your cats behaviour and health converting the activity to happiness points.

WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT

We already have the technology and several working prototypes. While our team has been working on the idea non-stop we're still a small group of people and can't do everything by ourselves. We're looking for your support to fund creating the plastic moulds to start mass production and help to finish the mobile app.









We’re a small team of developers and hardware enthusiasts from Wazombi Labs (www.wazombi.com). On Monday March 7th, we start our crowdfunding campaign to bring you the world’s first smartphone-controlled cat toy and fitness tracker - RollyCat We've done it before.We have successfully participated in accelerator programs for hardware startups (HAX, Garage48). We have run a successful crowdfunding campaign before (Smart Shades) and delivered in less than a year. 

While we work long hours on challenging hardware projects, our cats are often home alone – bored and patiently waiting for someone to play with them.Our wish was to give something back to our cats.
For the last year we’ve been working extra hours to build a smart cat-toy , which would be intelligent enough to play with our cats and track their activity when nobody else is at home.
Our project began to capture the imagination of cat owners around us – and soon others wanted to have a RollyCat!We’ve made many friends along our journey, carefully listening to their feedback – and are finally ready to release the RollyCat, for everyone!
Each RollyCat is made with love and care; a gift from us to our cat companions.Thank you for your support and enjoy the roll! Purrrrfect! 



We are committed to bringing you a great product, and won't settle for anything less. We have hired a company with a history of building and manufacturing Bluetooth gadgets. 
We know how to handle the operations from prototyping to shipping and distribution. We have partners in San Francisco and Tartu who we trust and who can help us deliver the product we are all going to love.
During our manufacturing stage, we will actively work with our partners in Shenzen to make sure that everything is up to our standards. We recognize that this might sometimes result in a delay in our manufacturing process if complications arise, but we have experience in different cycles of development and we prioritize high quality end-products. Rest assured we will notify everyone of what's going on at each stage so there will be no surprises. 
There are many ways to contribute! Even if you don't have the money right now, you can become part of the project, and help us turn this health toy into a reality by sharing this Indiegogo campaign with your friends. Click on the Facebook, Twitter sharing buttons to let the world know about the coming revolution in cat toys and fitness!

My cat really doesn't like to play
...”She doesn't really like to play with toys,” “She liked to play when she was a kitten, but now that she’s older, she just prefers to eat and sleep.” But this isn't exactly true because a cat's mental health depends on the amount of exercise and hunting activities. This doesn't necessarily mean  the play will be fun for the human, but indoor cats really need stimulation every day. 
But is it the right toy for my cat?
There are tons of different cat toys on the market. But how do you know your cat's toy preference? Is your cat a birder, a mouser, or a bugger. What does your kitty like to do with the toys when you are not around? Does your cat prefer toys that mimic birds, mice or catching bugs? Rollycat can do it all in one, it will learn from the playing pattern and adjust the movements to your cats preferences as to what stimulates them to interact the most. It's like Christmas for your kitty.
How does the automatic mode work?
Just choose ‘automatic’ play mode and leave the ball on the floor when you leave the house. RollyCat now knows that you’re away and your cat needs company. So it will automatically start moving every now-and-then. It will learn from the previous playing sessions and will adjust it's movement accordingly.

<h3><strong>Presenting the first evidence-based complete probiotics formula: Thrive by MDBiotics</strong></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490843902/tuax68advqvofuullfpc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Our gastrointestinal system harbors <strong>100 trillion microbial cells</strong>, which influence our overall health including the nutrition, metabolism, physiology, and immune function of our body. Some of these bacteria are good and some are not. The good bacteria keep the bad bacteria in check. This overall bacterial population has a symbiotic (mutually beneficial) relationship with our body. Research is increasingly showing that this symbiotic relationship is critical for overall health and wellness and its disruption contributes to progression of a number of diseases. Bacterial imbalance in the gut is proving to be a common pathway for progression of many conditions, including age-related reduction in metabolism, memory loss, dementia, heart disease, gastrointestinal disease, kidney disease, obesity and weight gain. Gut bacterial imbalance and protein fermentation by gut bacteria generates a myriad of toxic metabolites called endotoxins, including p-cresol and indoxyl sulfate. An unhealthy gut bacterial imbalance allows transfer of these toxins to all over the body, which contributes to inflammation, aging, and progression of disease.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492141951/bxyvbi595p222c3lkikg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Not all probiotics are created equal. MDBiotic’s probiotics (friendly bacteria) re-establishes intestinal symbiosis and neutralizes bacterial endotoxins. Studies behind Thrive by MDBiotics’ formula prove that probiotics have therapeutic roles in maintaining a metabolically-balanced gut microbiota and promoting a healthy body and brain.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490843296/cldeusjifukcsaglyltf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Think of Thrive as the multivitamin of probiotics, except it is based on data. </strong></p>
<p><strong>After 7 years of research and studying various strains of probiotics</strong>, we have come up with a complete proprietary formula that contains 9 specific strains of probiotics that have been shown to aid multiple conditions and in keeping a healthy body and mind. The specific strains and dosage of live probiotics in Thrive has been proven to re-establish this symbiosis and improve metabolism and weight, improve multiple conditions such as blood glucose in diabetes, improve blood pressure, improve migraine headaches, improve gastrointestinal pain, improve uremia in kidney disease, improve memory in Alzheimer’s patients, improve mood and reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression.</p>
<p>Thrive is not just for those who are striving to become healthier.<strong> Thrive plays a protective role and should be part of a healthy lifestyle.</strong></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>How is Thrive by MDBiotics different?</h3>
<p>There are hundreds of strains (different types) of probiotics. Some are more effective than others and some are not only ineffective, but can lead to undesired side effects, such as weight gain. Thrive by MDBiotics is the first evidence-based probiotics formula on the market. This means MDBiotics’ formula is the result of hundreds of peer-reviewed publications and thousands of data points. <strong>See our bibliography at the bottom of the page</strong>. MDBiotics’ proprietary formula contains live cultures and 9 specific clinically tested strains of probiotics that have been shown to promote overall health, increase metabolism, stabilize blood glucose, improve blood pressure, improve migraine headaches, improve gastrointestinal pain, improve uremia in kidney disease, play a protective role in memory loss, improve memory in Alzheimer’s patients, improve mood and reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression. Think of this formula as the “multi-vitamin” of probiotics.</p>

<h3>The science: What is the gut microbiome?</h3>
<p>The human gut harbors a complex community of 100 trillion microbial cells that constitute the gut microbiota. The combined microbial genome of the gut microbiota is known as the gut microbiome. In general, the adult gut is dominated by two bacterial phyla, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes; other phyla, including Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Cyanobacteria, Fusobacteria, Spirochaetes, and others, are present in smaller proportions. Each species of bacteria colonizes a specific niche, leading to different bacterial composition along the intestinal tract. Gut microbiota performs a multitude of functions and can be considered a metabolically active “organ” in itself. Under physiologic conditions, it participates in certain complementary metabolic activities that have not been fully evolved in the human host, such as breakdown of indigestible plant polysaccharides, synthesis of certain vitamins, biotransformation of conjugated bile acids, and degradation of dietary oxalates. Importantly, postnatal colonization of the intestine educates our immune system and reduces allergic responses to food and environmental antigens.</p> <h3>Metabolism and Weight loss</h3>
<p>Recent research findings suggest that our gut microbiota might be involved in the development of obesity and related disorders, such as insulin resistance. Weight gain is associated with an increase in the capacity of the microbiota to extract nutrients from the diet and in inducing metabolic changes in the host, such as increased fatty acid oxidation in muscle and increased triglyceride storage in the liver. Restoring a healthy gut with specific probiotics has been shown to lead the body towards healthier weights. Most probiotics formulas do not consider the weight loss or weight gain effect of their strains. Our team has done a lot of research into coming up with a formula that is holistic and considers all factors including weight loss. Probiotics have also been shown to possess antioxidant and free radical scavenging abilities, both of which are known for anti-aging properties and contribute to a healthier body.</p>
<h3>Heart Health</h3>
<p>The association between bacteria and atherosclerosis- clogging of arteries that lead to heart disease, has been known for more than two decades. Recently, focus has shifted from bacteria to its product, endotoxin, for its role in the development of atherosclerosis. Endotoxin is a key factor in initiation and progression of atherosclerosis through injuring the cells lining our arteries. Furthermore, vascular smooth muscle cells, one population of cells lining our arteries, exhibit profound responsiveness to even very low levels of endotoxin. Elevated endotoxin level is a strong risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis in the general population. Elevated plasma level of endotoxins is noted in patients with unstable angina, a dangerous heart condition that could lead to heart attack and is related to increased stiffness of aorta and plaque formation in the arteries supplying blood to the brain.  Specific probiotic strains in THRIVE have been shown to counteract buildup of endotoxins and reverse their toxicity.</p>
<h3>Kidney Health</h3>
<p>The gastrointestinal system is at the interphase between the blood and the potentially toxic contents of the gut. Histologic changes in the intestines at the molecular level, with inflammatory cells, are noted in chronic kidney disease. Uremia (build up of toxins in the blood) increases intestinal permeability, allowing movement of bacteria and endotoxins across the intestinal wall into the blood and the entire body.  Factors that promote intestinal dysbiosis  (imbalance) also contribute to the leaky gut in kidney disease. Gut microbiome dysbiosis is linked to micro-inflammation in patients with kidney disease. Specific probiotic strains in THRIVE have been shown to improve buildup of toxins (uremia) and counteract the toxicity.</p>
<h3>Memory, Dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.</h3>
<p>Dementia is a syndrome that affects memory and other cognitive functions to the extent that it interferes with daily function. There are many conditions that can cause dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. New research indicates that gastrointestinal tract microbiota (see definition above) are directly linked to memory functioning through triggering metabolic diseases and low-grade inflammation progress.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's disease is associated with severe cognitive impairments as well as some metabolic defects. Studies including a double-blind, and controlled clinical trial which was conducted among Alzheimer’s disease patients to assess the effects of probiotic supplementation on cognitive function and metabolic status have proven the connection between a healthy gastrointestinal system and the brain. After 12 weeks, the probiotic supplemented group showed a significant (more than 25%) improvement in memory.</p>
<h3>Improving Mood, Anxiety, Depression and Migraine Headaches</h3>
<p>Multiple randomized controlled trials have linked specific strains of probiotics in Thrive’s formula to improving mood, anxiety, depression and reducing severity of migraine headaches.</p>
<p>People suffering from depression experience significant mood, anxiety, and cognitive symptoms. Currently, most antidepressants work by altering neurotransmitter activity in the brain to improve these symptoms. However, in the last decade, research has revealed an extensive bidirectional communication network between the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system, referred to as the ""gut-brain axis."" Advances in this field have linked psychiatric disorders to changes in the microbiota. There is mounting evidence that the intestinal microbiota influences and modulates emotional behavior. This communication network between the gastrointestinal system and brain goes both directions and occurs via the autonomic nervous system, the enteric nervous system (nerve cells outside the lumen of the intestines), the neuroendocrine system, and the immune system. Several studies have looked at isolated nutrients and their impact on mental health. Central to this research are probiotics, defined as live microorganisms that, when ingested in adequate amounts, exert a health benefit on the host. Probiotics are transient entities that colonize the GI tract and influence various pathways. It has been well established that probiotics have therapeutic effects on many GI disorders such as inflammatory bowl disease; however, with the emergence of the gut–brain axis, it has been discovered that their therapeutic effects extend beyond the gut and into the central nervous system. There is robust evidence of this in multiple studies that have demonstrated probiotics’ ability to change behavior and improve the mood, anxiety and cognition of humans. Multiple studies have also shown that the specific strains of probiotics in Thrive have beneficial effects on the frequency and severity of migraine headache attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Probiotics have also been shown to possess both antioxidant and free radical scavenging abilities, increase production of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and improve absorption of other nutrients, all of which have been implicated in the pathophysiology of stress, anxiety and depression.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Dose and Directions</strong></h3>
<p>Thrive’s dosing is data-driven. The twice-daily dose of 5 billion SPECIFIC probiotics in this formula has been shown to be the most effective compared to other doses. Our doctors recommend you take one capsule once daily before bed for one week, and twice daily after that. The best times to take Thrive are after breakfast and before bed.</p>
<h3><strong>Storage &amp; Expiration</strong></h3>
<p>Thrive’s cutting-edge live-culture formulation means it can be stored at room temperature safely for up to 2 years.</p>
<h3><strong>Facilities and Quality of Production</strong></h3>
<p>Thrive by MDBiotics is completely made in the U.S.A. with the highest quality ingredients and is manufactured in FDA-approved facilities. Furthermore, the production is GMP certified, TGA certified (Australia), Health Canada Registered, Organic Certified, Kosher Certified and QAI Certified.

</div></div>","Presenting the first evidence-based complete probiotics formula: Thrive by MDBiotics

Our gastrointestinal system harbors 100 trillion microbial cells, which influence our overall health including the nutrition, metabolism, physiology, and immune function of our body. Some of these bacteria are good and some are not. The good bacteria keep the bad bacteria in check. This overall bacterial population has a symbiotic (mutually beneficial) relationship with our body. Research is increasingly showing that this symbiotic relationship is critical for overall health and wellness and its disruption contributes to progression of a number of diseases. Bacterial imbalance in the gut is proving to be a common pathway for progression of many conditions, including age-related reduction in metabolism, memory loss, dementia, heart disease, gastrointestinal disease, kidney disease, obesity and weight gain. Gut bacterial imbalance and protein fermentation by gut bacteria generates a myriad of toxic metabolites called endotoxins, including p-cresol and indoxyl sulfate. An unhealthy gut bacterial imbalance allows transfer of these toxins to all over the body, which contributes to inflammation, aging, and progression of disease.

Not all probiotics are created equal. MDBiotic’s probiotics (friendly bacteria) re-establishes intestinal symbiosis and neutralizes bacterial endotoxins. Studies behind Thrive by MDBiotics’ formula prove that probiotics have therapeutic roles in maintaining a metabolically-balanced gut microbiota and promoting a healthy body and brain.

 
Think of Thrive as the multivitamin of probiotics, except it is based on data. 
After 7 years of research and studying various strains of probiotics, we have come up with a complete proprietary formula that contains 9 specific strains of probiotics that have been shown to aid multiple conditions and in keeping a healthy body and mind. The specific strains and dosage of live probiotics in Thrive has been proven to re-establish this symbiosis and improve metabolism and weight, improve multiple conditions such as blood glucose in diabetes, improve blood pressure, improve migraine headaches, improve gastrointestinal pain, improve uremia in kidney disease, improve memory in Alzheimer’s patients, improve mood and reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression.
Thrive is not just for those who are striving to become healthier. Thrive plays a protective role and should be part of a healthy lifestyle.
 
How is Thrive by MDBiotics different?
There are hundreds of strains (different types) of probiotics. Some are more effective than others and some are not only ineffective, but can lead to undesired side effects, such as weight gain. Thrive by MDBiotics is the first evidence-based probiotics formula on the market. This means MDBiotics’ formula is the result of hundreds of peer-reviewed publications and thousands of data points. See our bibliography at the bottom of the page. MDBiotics’ proprietary formula contains live cultures and 9 specific clinically tested strains of probiotics that have been shown to promote overall health, increase metabolism, stabilize blood glucose, improve blood pressure, improve migraine headaches, improve gastrointestinal pain, improve uremia in kidney disease, play a protective role in memory loss, improve memory in Alzheimer’s patients, improve mood and reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression. Think of this formula as the “multi-vitamin” of probiotics.


 

The science: What is the gut microbiome?
The human gut harbors a complex community of 100 trillion microbial cells that constitute the gut microbiota. The combined microbial genome of the gut microbiota is known as the gut microbiome. In general, the adult gut is dominated by two bacterial phyla, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes; other phyla, including Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Cyanobacteria, Fusobacteria, Spirochaetes, and others, are present in smaller proportions. Each species of bacteria colonizes a specific niche, leading to different bacterial composition along the intestinal tract. Gut microbiota performs a multitude of functions and can be considered a metabolically active “organ” in itself. Under physiologic conditions, it participates in certain complementary metabolic activities that have not been fully evolved in the human host, such as breakdown of indigestible plant polysaccharides, synthesis of certain vitamins, biotransformation of conjugated bile acids, and degradation of dietary oxalates. Importantly, postnatal colonization of the intestine educates our immune system and reduces allergic responses to food and environmental antigens. Metabolism and Weight loss
Recent research findings suggest that our gut microbiota might be involved in the development of obesity and related disorders, such as insulin resistance. Weight gain is associated with an increase in the capacity of the microbiota to extract nutrients from the diet and in inducing metabolic changes in the host, such as increased fatty acid oxidation in muscle and increased triglyceride storage in the liver. Restoring a healthy gut with specific probiotics has been shown to lead the body towards healthier weights. Most probiotics formulas do not consider the weight loss or weight gain effect of their strains. Our team has done a lot of research into coming up with a formula that is holistic and considers all factors including weight loss. Probiotics have also been shown to possess antioxidant and free radical scavenging abilities, both of which are known for anti-aging properties and contribute to a healthier body.
Heart Health
The association between bacteria and atherosclerosis- clogging of arteries that lead to heart disease, has been known for more than two decades. Recently, focus has shifted from bacteria to its product, endotoxin, for its role in the development of atherosclerosis. Endotoxin is a key factor in initiation and progression of atherosclerosis through injuring the cells lining our arteries. Furthermore, vascular smooth muscle cells, one population of cells lining our arteries, exhibit profound responsiveness to even very low levels of endotoxin. Elevated endotoxin level is a strong risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis in the general population. Elevated plasma level of endotoxins is noted in patients with unstable angina, a dangerous heart condition that could lead to heart attack and is related to increased stiffness of aorta and plaque formation in the arteries supplying blood to the brain.  Specific probiotic strains in THRIVE have been shown to counteract buildup of endotoxins and reverse their toxicity.
Kidney Health
The gastrointestinal system is at the interphase between the blood and the potentially toxic contents of the gut. Histologic changes in the intestines at the molecular level, with inflammatory cells, are noted in chronic kidney disease. Uremia (build up of toxins in the blood) increases intestinal permeability, allowing movement of bacteria and endotoxins across the intestinal wall into the blood and the entire body.  Factors that promote intestinal dysbiosis  (imbalance) also contribute to the leaky gut in kidney disease. Gut microbiome dysbiosis is linked to micro-inflammation in patients with kidney disease. Specific probiotic strains in THRIVE have been shown to improve buildup of toxins (uremia) and counteract the toxicity.
Memory, Dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.
Dementia is a syndrome that affects memory and other cognitive functions to the extent that it interferes with daily function. There are many conditions that can cause dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. New research indicates that gastrointestinal tract microbiota (see definition above) are directly linked to memory functioning through triggering metabolic diseases and low-grade inflammation progress.
Alzheimer's disease is associated with severe cognitive impairments as well as some metabolic defects. Studies including a double-blind, and controlled clinical trial which was conducted among Alzheimer’s disease patients to assess the effects of probiotic supplementation on cognitive function and metabolic status have proven the connection between a healthy gastrointestinal system and the brain. After 12 weeks, the probiotic supplemented group showed a significant (more than 25%) improvement in memory.
Improving Mood, Anxiety, Depression and Migraine Headaches
Multiple randomized controlled trials have linked specific strains of probiotics in Thrive’s formula to improving mood, anxiety, depression and reducing severity of migraine headaches.
People suffering from depression experience significant mood, anxiety, and cognitive symptoms. Currently, most antidepressants work by altering neurotransmitter activity in the brain to improve these symptoms. However, in the last decade, research has revealed an extensive bidirectional communication network between the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system, referred to as the ""gut-brain axis."" Advances in this field have linked psychiatric disorders to changes in the microbiota. There is mounting evidence that the intestinal microbiota influences and modulates emotional behavior. This communication network between the gastrointestinal system and brain goes both directions and occurs via the autonomic nervous system, the enteric nervous system (nerve cells outside the lumen of the intestines), the neuroendocrine system, and the immune system. Several studies have looked at isolated nutrients and their impact on mental health. Central to this research are probiotics, defined as live microorganisms that, when ingested in adequate amounts, exert a health benefit on the host. Probiotics are transient entities that colonize the GI tract and influence various pathways. It has been well established that probiotics have therapeutic effects on many GI disorders such as inflammatory bowl disease; however, with the emergence of the gut–brain axis, it has been discovered that their therapeutic effects extend beyond the gut and into the central nervous system. There is robust evidence of this in multiple studies that have demonstrated probiotics’ ability to change behavior and improve the mood, anxiety and cognition of humans. Multiple studies have also shown that the specific strains of probiotics in Thrive have beneficial effects on the frequency and severity of migraine headache attacks.
Probiotics have also been shown to possess both antioxidant and free radical scavenging abilities, increase production of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and improve absorption of other nutrients, all of which have been implicated in the pathophysiology of stress, anxiety and depression.

<p>Fitness Is Only One Dimension Of Health<br/></p>
</div>
<p>Wearable fitness trackers
and smartwatches have been all the rage but are they really improving your health?  Most track not much more than physical
activity with manufacturer preset sensors. Sensors that are meant to collect a
few common parameters such as walking distance, steps, heart rate. But everyone
is different, and these parameters may not be the most important to an
individual’s particular health needs and conditions. Plus, health needs and
conditions change over time. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453679447/uddqxgxkmgmxlphx3r39.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Not to mention the fact that sensors are getting outdated in their capability and accuracy all the time. This is only going to accelerate as new sensor technologies are developed making possible new kinds of measurement with higher levels of accuracy. But once a fitness tracker or a smartwatch with their preset sensors is outdated, the only way to benefit from the new technologies is to get the next device.</p>
<div style=""font: 40.0px Calibri; color: #619ac6;"">
<p><br/></p>
<p>Doctoh. Personalizeable. Updateable.</p>
</div>
<p>What if there was a health
wearable that was modular and easily changeable? Allowing each person to simply
change the sensors to measure the parameters most important to them. Meet
Doctoh, a patent pending wrist wearable system with changeable sensor bands. Each
sensor band comes with the most complete group of sensors today’s technologies
can provide to measure the parameters related to a specific need. </p><p>Snap in the
<b>Doctoh Fitness Band</b> and the device can monitor heart rate, skin temperature,
skin moisture, movement, location, and skin conductance. Easily detach the band
using a secure lock-and-release mechanism and now you can attach the <b>Doctoh
Heart Band</b> that addresses specific cardiac monitoring needs such as heart rate,
heart rhythm, blood pressure and blood vessel resistance. New sensor
technologies become available to measure even more parameters or measure existing
ones much more accurately. No problem, just take out the old band and replace
with the new one containing the very latest sensors.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454389297/c5gxpyzyo74h7erbxrjx.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Such easy
changeability achieves a significant level of personalization for the
particular health monitoring needs of an individual. And as the needs change,
the sensor bands can snap out and new ones snap in without the need to get a
new device. As new sensor technology becomes available for a particular health
condition, you only need to replace the current band instead of getting a new
device. No need to get used to a whole another device, a whole another
interface.</p>
<p>In fact, such a system
has the potential for use in doctor offices, even hospitals.  Imagine a patient wearing a Doctoh device equipped
with specific modules addressing their individual medical conditions. The
Doctoh app simply streams the information wirelessly from the device, directly
to the physician. It even identifies alerts depending on the condition being
monitored so that proactive actions or timely follow-ups to any issues can be performed.
</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Furthermore, hospital
administrators can save valuable time when overworked nursing staffs can put a </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Doctoh
Hospital Band</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> on a patient's wrist and have the vital signs, pulse oximetry and
other important parameters wirelessly transmitted to monitors at the nursing
station. Software integration with Electronic Medical Records may also be
possible in the near future. RFID tracking technology incorporated in the
Doctoh Hospital Band could allow doctors, nurses and other medical team support
staff to physically locate the patient in the facility no matter where the
patient has been sent for testing or treatment. A patient's medical record
number, insurance information, health history, medication list and drug
allergies can be stored in the Doctoh Hospital Band allowing software
integration with Pharmacy services to avoid potential conflicts or adverse drug
interactions when new medications are prescribed. Hospital billing for each
service rendered can be done by simply scanning the patient's Doctoh. </span><br/></p><p>Then when
the patient is ready to be discharged, the Doctoh Hospital Band can be easily
switched to the one most suited for that patient’s post discharge monitoring,
for instance a Doctoh Heart Band for post cardiac care, a <b>Doctoh Worksafety Band</b> after a heat stroke related to occupational heat exposure, or a <b>Doctoh Metabolics
Band</b> to help monitor a patient with a diabetic complication.</p>

modular design of Doctoh makes it the one system an individual will ever need
for monitoring and tracking the many dimensions of health data they will need
through the years.  So be a part of the
future and support us in making it a reality! Because health monitoring that
really improves health has many dimensions. Fitness is only just one of them.</p>

</div></div>","Fitness Is Only One Dimension Of Health

Wearable fitness trackers
and smartwatches have been all the rage but are they really improving your health?  Most track not much more than physical
activity with manufacturer preset sensors. Sensors that are meant to collect a
few common parameters such as walking distance, steps, heart rate. But everyone
is different, and these parameters may not be the most important to an
individual’s particular health needs and conditions. Plus, health needs and
conditions change over time. 


Not to mention the fact that sensors are getting outdated in their capability and accuracy all the time. This is only going to accelerate as new sensor technologies are developed making possible new kinds of measurement with higher levels of accuracy. But once a fitness tracker or a smartwatch with their preset sensors is outdated, the only way to benefit from the new technologies is to get the next device.


Doctoh. Personalizeable. Updateable.

What if there was a health
wearable that was modular and easily changeable? Allowing each person to simply
change the sensors to measure the parameters most important to them. Meet
Doctoh, a patent pending wrist wearable system with changeable sensor bands. Each
sensor band comes with the most complete group of sensors today’s technologies
can provide to measure the parameters related to a specific need. Snap in the
Doctoh Fitness Band and the device can monitor heart rate, skin temperature,
skin moisture, movement, location, and skin conductance. Easily detach the band
using a secure lock-and-release mechanism and now you can attach the Doctoh
Heart Band that addresses specific cardiac monitoring needs such as heart rate,
heart rhythm, blood pressure and blood vessel resistance. New sensor
technologies become available to measure even more parameters or measure existing
ones much more accurately. No problem, just take out the old band and replace
with the new one containing the very latest sensors.
Such easy
changeability achieves a significant level of personalization for the
particular health monitoring needs of an individual. And as the needs change,
the sensor bands can snap out and new ones snap in without the need to get a
new device. As new sensor technology becomes available for a particular health
condition, you only need to replace the current band instead of getting a new
device. No need to get used to a whole another device, a whole another
interface.
In fact, such a system
has the potential for use in doctor offices, even hospitals.  Imagine a patient wearing a Doctoh device equipped
with specific modules addressing their individual medical conditions. The
Doctoh app simply streams the information wirelessly from the device, directly
to the physician. It even identifies alerts depending on the condition being
monitored so that proactive actions or timely follow-ups to any issues can be performed.

Furthermore, hospital
administrators can save valuable time when overworked nursing staffs can put a Doctoh
Hospital Band on a patient's wrist and have the vital signs, pulse oximetry and
other important parameters wirelessly transmitted to monitors at the nursing
station. Software integration with Electronic Medical Records may also be
possible in the near future. RFID tracking technology incorporated in the
Doctoh Hospital Band could allow doctors, nurses and other medical team support
staff to physically locate the patient in the facility no matter where the
patient has been sent for testing or treatment. A patient's medical record
number, insurance information, health history, medication list and drug
allergies can be stored in the Doctoh Hospital Band allowing software
integration with Pharmacy services to avoid potential conflicts or adverse drug
interactions when new medications are prescribed. Hospital billing for each
service rendered can be done by simply scanning the patient's Doctoh. Then when
the patient is ready to be discharged, the Doctoh Hospital Band can be easily
switched to the one most suited for that patient’s post discharge monitoring,
for instance a Doctoh Heart Band for post cardiac care, a Doctoh Worksafety Band after a heat stroke related to occupational heat exposure, or a Doctoh Metabolics
Band to help monitor a patient with a diabetic complication.
The flexibility and
modular design of Doctoh makes it the one system an individual will ever need
for monitoring and tracking the many dimensions of health data they will need
through the years.  So be a part of the
future and support us in making it a reality! Because health monitoring that
really improves health has many dimensions. Fitness is only just one of them.




Where Is Doctoh Today

February 2015. We completed a design brief. Yes, we called
our device healthring then. 


March 2015. We conducted extensive product image research
and completed our initial design sketches.






April 2015. We better understood the conceptual
limitations involved in achieving our two main goals of changeability and
simplicity in usage. So we went back to the drawing board and completed another
round of design sketches. 






May 2015. We picked an affordable off the shelf display
unit with good specs for our prototype and completed design sketches to
incorporate this while further fine tuning the concept.






June 2015. We completed 3D modeling and built study models
to validate usability, form factor, and mechanical engineering aspects. The
initial ABS rapid study models were certainly large!






August 2015. We fine tuned the design to trim dimensions
and improve the lock-and-release mechanisms. We developed an innovative resizer
system so the device can easily adjust to fit different wrist sizes comfortably.
Then we worked with several prototyping suppliers to get micromachined body parts,
connectors, molds and materials, to complete the mechanical prototype. And, we renamed
our device “Doctoh”.October 2015. We sourced inexpensive off the shelf sensors,
a new blutooth communications chip, a battery and other electrical components and
designed the PCB. We completed PCB fabrication and full component assembly. There
were some glitches with the first circuit – it did not work properly with the
display! We resolved the issues and completed the electronics prototype.













January 2016. We completed planning for the manufacturing of the device and are raising the necessary funds. So be a part of the future and support us in making it a reality! Because health monitoring that really improves health has many dimensions. Fitness is only just one of them.








What We Need Now


A great deal of further development work still needs to be
completed before we can release the specifications to a manufacturer for a
retail product. The funds raised will be used to complete all this work till
Summer-Fall 2016.

[ 52 FR 33702, Sept. 4, 1987, as amended at 66 FR 38815, July 25, 2001]</p><p><strong>What amount of weight can I use with the Archlifter™?</strong></p><p>This is where sensibility is the best policy. To use the Universal Version of the Archlifter™ start with a small traction force. This means that when you attach the Archlifter™ to the sturdy overhead support (such as a pull up bar) use the extension straps (included) to bring the traction device to head level. After mounting into the device, grab onto the handles and slowly start to bend your knees to place some of your weight on the Archlifter™. A small amount of weight is the best place to start. Once you start to feel the traction forces in your neck, hold steady without adding more weight for a minute. Increase the time and traction force (body weight) as you can tolerate. It’s common to feel a bit of soreness the day after. This should not cause you to worry, but if you do feel soreness, back off your routine to allow the soreness to resolve before moving on with your traction routine. Large, sudden increases in traction forces are associated with a higher incidence of side-effects, while slower, incremental increases in traction forces are better tolerated. For many smaller adults, a peak traction force of only 35 lbs over time is sufficient to reverse the effects of gravity and screen hunch, while larger individuals may need a peak traction force of 50 to 75 lbs plus. There is no reason or known benefit to use more than 50% of body weight. In obese adults the percentage of body weight will be smaller, and using the ideal weight to calculate traction force is more realistic and reasonable.</p><p><strong>I have dentures. Can I use the Archlifter™?</strong></p><p>The Archlifter™ has an interchangeable strut that supports the maxillary pusher. The maxillary pusher can be one of two types: The Universal Version or the Dentist Version. The Universal Version was designed to be used independent of teeth, no teeth or palate size. If you are a denture or partial denture wearer, please take the removable dentures out before using the Archlifter™. The palate pusher applies forces to the roof of the mouth (the palate) and the denture may break or interfere with the function of the soft silicone pushing pad. Your dentist can fabricate a custom made palatal coverage appliance specifically to function with the Archlifter™.</p><p><strong>I have a palatal torus. Can I use the Archlifter™?</strong></p><p>A palatal torus is a small or large benign bony lump that is sometimes on the roof of the mouth. The palatal pushing pad is very soft and should not irritate the torus. However, if your torus is unusually large or sensitive, try using the super-soft sleeve that fits over the palatal pad. This will make for more of a mouthful, but will have additional cushioning power.</p><p><strong>I have a very narrow, tall palate. Can I use the Archlifter™?</strong></p><p>If your palate is unusually small or narrow or V-shaped, you best option is to use the super-soft sleeve over the palatal pad. The sleeve may overlap onto the teeth a bit. You should still be able to use the Archlifter™. If you are still having problems finding a comfortable fit, please visit your dentist for advice and solutions.</p><p><strong>I have weak, questionable teeth or bridges in my upper jaw. Can I use the Archlifter™?</strong></p><p>In this case- whether you know you already have questionable or bad or decayed teeth, old bridges, loose teeth, crowns or fillings, or gum disease or implants, you must get checked by your dentist prior to using the Archlifter™.</p><p><strong>I have a cleft palate. Can I use the Archlifter™?</strong></p><p>If you have a cleft palate, with or without an obturator, you should ask your dentist whether or not the Universal Version is appropriate. The super-soft sleeve solves most of these problems, however your dentist will need to determine the suitability of your palate to absorb the traction forces. In the case there is little or no actual bone in the palatal area, your best advice may be to have a custom dental appliance made by your dentist. Please consult your dental professional for more information.</p><p><strong>I have had head and/or neck surgery. Can I use the Archlifter™?</strong></p><p>The good news about traction is it is quite variable. You can use small forces over longer periods of time to help get relief in cases of prior neck surgery. Your head and neck weigh in at about 5 to 10 kg. You will need at least this much force to have a counteractive effect on the forces of gravity. If you have had prior neck surgery and are planning to use the Archlifter™, please inform your health care professional of your plans and ask for guidance and/or monitoring. Make sure your provider is familiar with the Archlifter™ traction and treatment method by sharing this information with him or her.</p><p><strong>I have had a serious head or neck injury or accident. Can I use the Archlifter™?</strong></p><p>Prudence is the best policy. Seek the advice of your doctor.</p><p><strong>I have a medical problem. Can I use the Archlifter™?</strong></p><p>Again prudence is the best policy. Seek the advice of your doctor.</p><p><strong>Can the Archlifter™ be used with children?</strong></p><p>The Archlifter™ has not been tested in underage individuals. There is a similar traction method in use (Halo traction) for many years in children. This traction method involves cranial fixation (a surgical procedure) followed by a period of regular traction use in young scoliosis patients. The halo traction treatment lasts for several weeks or months in the pre-surgical phase of scoliosis correction. Halo traction helps to line up the vertebrae in the spine to facilitate an easier and less-complicated surgical correction. Archlifter™ traction therapy produces the same quality of traction, however since the Archlifter™ transmits the traction forces through the maxillary bone (the upper jaw) it is unclear if there will be any adverse effects of these forces on bone growth and development in growing individuals or individuals with palatal or facial bony defects. If your doctor suggests Archlifter™ traction therapy as an alternative to halo traction, I suggest that an orthodontist or dentist make a lateral cephalogram x-ray image and record the orthodontic landmarks prior, during and after the traction therapy, a neurological assessment prior, during and after treatment and perhaps bone-density monitoring while in treatment. In addition, Vitamin D, Calcium supplements along with regular sunlight exposure is recommended. (2) Through vigilant monitoring, the treatment can be halted or modified if necessary. Current research suggests an extended period of traction “as long as possible” (3) prior to surgical intervention. It may be beneficial to use the Archlifter™ and light forces over an extended period prior to surgical intervention or to halo traction use.</p><p><strong>What side-effects are associated with traction therapy?</strong></p><p>Most of the symptoms of spinal degeneration are caused by the slow accumulation of the effects of gravity and slouching or screen hunch. It’s these daily forces on your back and neck that add up over time. Traction with the Archlifter™ should be thought of as a daily antidote to gravity and screen hunch. This is where the Archlifter™ shines- it allows you to counteract gravity and screen hunch at the same rate- daily in your own home.</p><p>Most of the side-effects of traction therapy are associated with sudden large increases in traction forces. With adults in treatment, these side effects may be:</p><ul>
<li>Muscle spasms</li>
<li>Soreness in the neck, shoulders and back.</li>
</ul><p>If you have any of these symptoms, please discontinue traction treatments until the symptoms resolve. When you re-start traction, use a lighter traction force, and more gradual increases in force or weights.</p><p>Rarely: Headache, dizziness and nausea, hearing or vision problems.<br/>Discontinue traction and consult your doctor before attempting traction again.</p><p><strong>What contraindications are there to traction therapy?</strong></p><p>Please consult your doctor before using traction therapy if you have:</p><ul>
<li>any moderate to severe medical problem.</li>
<li>rheumatoid arthritis.</li>
<li>postsurgery hardware such as screws in your neck.</li>
<li>a recent fracture or injury in the neck area.</li>
<li>a known tumor in the neck area.</li>
<li>a bone infection.</li>
<li>issues or blockages with vertebral or carotid arteries.</li>
<li>osteoporosis.</li>
<li>cervical instability.</li>
<li>spinal or cervical hypermobility.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Will my Archlifter device ship with a Medical Product Label?</strong></p><p>Yes, there will be the device label (instructions) as required by your country.</p><p><strong>Hygiene: P</strong>lease use the Archlifter™ with a plastic hygienic barrier to avoid cross contamination. If you have a swelling or sores in your mouth or an active oral infection, please refrain from using the Archlifter™ until completely resolved.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">FDA 510k exempt:<br/>888.5850 Nonpowered Orthopedic<br/>Traction Apparatus And Accessories.</p><p><strong>Citations:</strong></p><p>(1) Piccin CF, Pozzebon D, Scapini F, Corrêa ECR.

[ 52 FR 33702, Sept. 4, 1987, as amended at 66 FR 38815, July 25, 2001]What amount of weight can I use with the Archlifter™?This is where sensibility is the best policy. To use the Universal Version of the Archlifter™ start with a small traction force. This means that when you attach the Archlifter™ to the sturdy overhead support (such as a pull up bar) use the extension straps (included) to bring the traction device to head level. After mounting into the device, grab onto the handles and slowly start to bend your knees to place some of your weight on the Archlifter™. A small amount of weight is the best place to start. Once you start to feel the traction forces in your neck, hold steady without adding more weight for a minute. Increase the time and traction force (body weight) as you can tolerate. It’s common to feel a bit of soreness the day after. This should not cause you to worry, but if you do feel soreness, back off your routine to allow the soreness to resolve before moving on with your traction routine. Large, sudden increases in traction forces are associated with a higher incidence of side-effects, while slower, incremental increases in traction forces are better tolerated. For many smaller adults, a peak traction force of only 35 lbs over time is sufficient to reverse the effects of gravity and screen hunch, while larger individuals may need a peak traction force of 50 to 75 lbs plus. There is no reason or known benefit to use more than 50% of body weight. In obese adults the percentage of body weight will be smaller, and using the ideal weight to calculate traction force is more realistic and reasonable.I have dentures. Can I use the Archlifter™?The Archlifter™ has an interchangeable strut that supports the maxillary pusher. The maxillary pusher can be one of two types: The Universal Version or the Dentist Version. The Universal Version was designed to be used independent of teeth, no teeth or palate size. If you are a denture or partial denture wearer, please take the removable dentures out before using the Archlifter™. The palate pusher applies forces to the roof of the mouth (the palate) and the denture may break or interfere with the function of the soft silicone pushing pad. Your dentist can fabricate a custom made palatal coverage appliance specifically to function with the Archlifter™.I have a palatal torus. Can I use the Archlifter™?A palatal torus is a small or large benign bony lump that is sometimes on the roof of the mouth. The palatal pushing pad is very soft and should not irritate the torus. However, if your torus is unusually large or sensitive, try using the super-soft sleeve that fits over the palatal pad. This will make for more of a mouthful, but will have additional cushioning power.I have a very narrow, tall palate. Can I use the Archlifter™?If your palate is unusually small or narrow or V-shaped, you best option is to use the super-soft sleeve over the palatal pad. The sleeve may overlap onto the teeth a bit. You should still be able to use the Archlifter™. If you are still having problems finding a comfortable fit, please visit your dentist for advice and solutions.I have weak, questionable teeth or bridges in my upper jaw. Can I use the Archlifter™?In this case- whether you know you already have questionable or bad or decayed teeth, old bridges, loose teeth, crowns or fillings, or gum disease or implants, you must get checked by your dentist prior to using the Archlifter™.I have a cleft palate. Can I use the Archlifter™?If you have a cleft palate, with or without an obturator, you should ask your dentist whether or not the Universal Version is appropriate. The super-soft sleeve solves most of these problems, however your dentist will need to determine the suitability of your palate to absorb the traction forces. In the case there is little or no actual bone in the palatal area, your best advice may be to have a custom dental appliance made by your dentist. Please consult your dental professional for more information.I have had head and/or neck surgery. Can I use the Archlifter™?The good news about traction is it is quite variable. You can use small forces over longer periods of time to help get relief in cases of prior neck surgery. Your head and neck weigh in at about 5 to 10 kg. You will need at least this much force to have a counteractive effect on the forces of gravity. If you have had prior neck surgery and are planning to use the Archlifter™, please inform your health care professional of your plans and ask for guidance and/or monitoring. Make sure your provider is familiar with the Archlifter™ traction and treatment method by sharing this information with him or her.I have had a serious head or neck injury or accident. Can I use the Archlifter™?Prudence is the best policy. Seek the advice of your doctor.I have a medical problem. Can I use the Archlifter™?Again prudence is the best policy. Seek the advice of your doctor.Can the Archlifter™ be used with children?The Archlifter™ has not been tested in underage individuals. There is a similar traction method in use (Halo traction) for many years in children. This traction method involves cranial fixation (a surgical procedure) followed by a period of regular traction use in young scoliosis patients. The halo traction treatment lasts for several weeks or months in the pre-surgical phase of scoliosis correction. Halo traction helps to line up the vertebrae in the spine to facilitate an easier and less-complicated surgical correction. Archlifter™ traction therapy produces the same quality of traction, however since the Archlifter™ transmits the traction forces through the maxillary bone (the upper jaw) it is unclear if there will be any adverse effects of these forces on bone growth and development in growing individuals or individuals with palatal or facial bony defects. If your doctor suggests Archlifter™ traction therapy as an alternative to halo traction, I suggest that an orthodontist or dentist make a lateral cephalogram x-ray image and record the orthodontic landmarks prior, during and after the traction therapy, a neurological assessment prior, during and after treatment and perhaps bone-density monitoring while in treatment. In addition, Vitamin D, Calcium supplements along with regular sunlight exposure is recommended. (2) Through vigilant monitoring, the treatment can be halted or modified if necessary. Current research suggests an extended period of traction “as long as possible” (3) prior to surgical intervention. It may be beneficial to use the Archlifter™ and light forces over an extended period prior to surgical intervention or to halo traction use.What side-effects are associated with traction therapy?Most of the symptoms of spinal degeneration are caused by the slow accumulation of the effects of gravity and slouching or screen hunch. It’s these daily forces on your back and neck that add up over time. Traction with the Archlifter™ should be thought of as a daily antidote to gravity and screen hunch. This is where the Archlifter™ shines- it allows you to counteract gravity and screen hunch at the same rate- daily in your own home.Most of the side-effects of traction therapy are associated with sudden large increases in traction forces. With adults in treatment, these side effects may be:
Muscle spasms
Soreness in the neck, shoulders and back.
If you have any of these symptoms, please discontinue traction treatments until the symptoms resolve. When you re-start traction, use a lighter traction force, and more gradual increases in force or weights.Rarely: Headache, dizziness and nausea, hearing or vision problems.Discontinue traction and consult your doctor before attempting traction again.What contraindications are there to traction therapy?Please consult your doctor before using traction therapy if you have:
any moderate to severe medical problem.
rheumatoid arthritis.
postsurgery hardware such as screws in your neck.
a recent fracture or injury in the neck area.
a known tumor in the neck area.
a bone infection.
issues or blockages with vertebral or carotid arteries.
osteoporosis.
cervical instability.
spinal or cervical hypermobility.
Will my Archlifter device ship with a Medical Product Label?Yes, there will be the device label (instructions) as required by your country.Hygiene: Please use the Archlifter™ with a plastic hygienic barrier to avoid cross contamination. If you have a swelling or sores in your mouth or an active oral infection, please refrain from using the Archlifter™ until completely resolved.FDA 510k exempt:888.5850 Nonpowered OrthopedicTraction Apparatus And Accessories.Citations:(1) Piccin CF, Pozzebon D, Scapini F, Corrêa ECR.

</div></div>","Vie Zone is the neuro earphones that analyze your brain activity and use music neurofeedback and to help you relieve stress and reach optimal focus and stay there for longer. With Vie Zone you can stay calm, get focus anytime, anywhere.


Being free from distracting noise is important to developing focus, Vie Zone's patented ""SoftShell"" technology provides superior comfort for longer periods of time and has a high passive noise-reducing capability to create the perfect isolation from distracting noises.


Neurofeedback has been used as a brain-enhancing technique by many elite athletes and CEOs to help them achieve peak performance. Until now it has been nearly inaccessible due to the high cost and technical complexity. Vie Zone unlocks this ability for everyone. By combining the power of neurofeedback and personalized AI-selected music, Vie Zone helps you to hyper-focus and get into the flow state, anywhere, anytime.


Concentrating too hard for too long can wear out your brain and your body. Vie Zone analyzes your brain fatigue level and lets you know when a break is needed.


When your brain fatigue level is too high, Vie Zone offers neurofeedback sound meditation and binaural beats to help you to relieve stress and recover your optimal mental state faster than ever before. 


 
VieZone tracks your mental performance, so you can see how long you stay focused during your work, how much your brain is fatigued and how well you have recovered during the sound meditation, so you can learn to manage your mental well-being over time.



Vie Zone comes with various soothing music and focus music to create the perfect environment for your mental performance.  Whether it's your favorite jazz tune, soothing music, binaural beats or ASMR, just select your favorite songs from our premium music selections and the global music services.








Vie Style has successfully released a series of high-quality Bluetooth audio products on Kickstarter. Our proprietary audio technology ensures supreme sound quality and superior comfort.



Vie Zone is co-developed and partnered with worldwide recognized organizations; The University of Tokyo, KDDI and NTT Data. The University of Tokyo published the first research paper about Vie Zone and accepted by the 43rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society. Through the series of studies, Vie Zone is scientifically proven to be highly efficient and effective.


We are easily distracted today by the flood of texts, emails and message notifications making us less productive and unable to focus. This problem has rapidly accelerated now that many of us work from home.


According to research by Carnegie Mellon University,  on average a person loses focus every 11 min and then requires 25 minutes to get back on task. That means we lose 30,000 minutes just being distracted yearly. VieZone helps you to stay focused and recover faster when you happen to lose focus.

 
 
 
Check out the founder & CEO, Yazz doing a live demo of how Vie Zone works.




Vie Zone is the most efficient, effective, scientifically proved, organic way to meditate, enhance focus, train your mind with a lot of fun and without any stress.




Vie Zone is co-developed and partnered with worldwide recognized organizations; The University of Tokyo, KDDI and NTT Data. The University of Tokyo is considered to be the most selective and prestigious university in Japan and ranks among the top 25  universities of the world. The research paper published by the University of Tokyo has been accepted by the 43rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.
Both KDDI and NTT Data are two of Japan's top major telecommunication companies. Through a series of studies, Vie Zone has been scientifically proven to be effective and highly efficient.



Vie Zone is an elegantly designed smart device that uses earphones to pick up brain activity (EEG) and heart rate (ECG). It uses two soft rubber ear-tip sensors that can fit into your ear comfortably along with two neck sensors.


Neurofeedback is a type of brain enhancement training used by top athletes and executives to improve mental performance. It can tune your brain just by watching videos or listening to audio. This method has been medically proven and is widely used for mental performance training of athletes, executives, military forces as well as being used in mental clinics as a treatment for mental illnesses like ADHD, bipolar disorder and depression.


VieZone improves your productivity, reduces stress and helps you recover from brain fatigue just by listening to music. Getting into focus has never been easier.
We all know music can affect your mood, feelings and mental state.  At Vie Zone we embrace that in a positive way. We combine neuroscience with the power of music to tune your brain and improve focus.


Every brain is different. That's why we have developed a system to adapt to your unique state. Vie Zone doesn’t just analyze focus and calm states -  it can learn your individual brain pattern and create your own personal model.
Just select your most important tasks, either for mental work, athletics or creative work and Vie Zone will help you reach your optimum focus level every time you do your task. Vie Zone will learn from your own brain activity and adapt to you.


We have partnered with The University of Tokyo since 2020 to develop the ZONE AI. The system uses In-Ear EEG earphones to analyze the flow state (a.k.a. eustress) and enhance productivity. This project was run successfully and the first research paper was published.


In-Ear EEG Technology traditionally has experienced a lot of challenges. Reduced signal amplitude, as well as a reduction in the number of brain regions in which activity can be measured, were significant limitations to this method.
Vie Zone goes beyond this limit.  Along with NTT DATA, Vie Zone co-developed an “EAR2BRAIN” signal reconstruction system utilizing AI to reconstruct the full scalp EEG signal from a casual In-Ear device resulting in the ability to detect a wider range of brain activity with higher accuracy.


It’s no secret music can affect your mood, feelings and mental state. We ran a scientific research study with KDDI (a major Japanese telecom company) to learn more about how music affects us while using Vie Zone.
The result showed that your favorite music is the most effective intervention to your mental state. Vie Zone's AI-powered music player will create personal playlists that affect your mood the most.

We started this project in 2016. During the last 5 years, we have developed a number of different prototypes to ensure Vie Zone picks up high-quality signals as well as being ultra-comfortable to wear.

<p><strong>Thank you for your interest!</strong></p>
<p>About 5 years ago, we set off on a mission to bring the healthful benefits of the sun inside to help employers and employees alike, create healthy, exciting, energetic and productive work environments!</p>
<p>We’ve all heard how the sun is critical to our overall well-being…and how today’s society spends less and less time out in it. The lack of sunlight has had a profound effect on our healthfulness. “Reduced energy, performance, slowed metabolism, insomnia and even depression are part of a growing list of issues associated with this migration indoors. Wouldn’t it be great if you could improve your health and wellness naturally by simply bringing the sun to work with you?! Our young company allows you to do exactly that.</p>
<p>Summarily:</p>
<p>We build smart, personal lighting systems that pack the colored light spectrum of a bright, sunlit sky into a sophisticated and sexy desk lamp, used as you would an ordinary one, but that actually delivers the energizing benefits of the sun, indoors, where you need it most!</p>
<p>Our journey began with a love for the outdoors and the constant desire to be in the sun. </p>
<p>Many of us continue to struggle through the gloomy winter months! We drew inspiration from these long dark days to ensure that although the harsh weather will inevitably return, thanks to the LifeLight Touch, many of us will be basking in the healthful benefits of the sun no matter what the weather, season or time of day.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1549489270/uzvhopxcms4ozgzttcv5.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>After months of research and development with an exceptionally talented team of technologists and medical professionals, we were able to deliver the LifeLight Touch to an amazing collection of enterprise clients.</p>
<p>Those partners including TJX, BAE, Barclays, Digital Credit Union (DCU) and Todd &amp; Weld, to name a few, provided valuable feedback that allowed us to optimize the production design. </p>
<h3><strong>Now we need your help to make the LifeLight Touch a production reality!</strong></h3>
<p>Through your support and backing of this IndieGoGo campaign, not only will you receive the first and only natural, energy boosting, personal, sunlight delivery system, but your support will help Sun LifeLight make this life changing system available to all that spend so much of their day indoors, no matter where they live!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1549459437/gktnnuqzaw5qx2dfuue0.jpg"" src=""""/>The system is purpose built for use by computer using office professionals, students and home based workers that spend most of their workday indoors. With this simple yet sophisticated and patent protected system, those that don't receive the energizing benefits of being in the sun while at work, can still gain those natural, energy amplifying, mood enhancing and productivity boosting attributes at or around their computer workstations!</p>
<p>Corporations and individuals alike, benefit by virtually transporting their workstations to sun drenched destinations!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1548190499/rhqhaulzorjf0nnzpitp.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Computer-using office professionals, students and home based workers do not receive enough sunlight during the workday to maintain a healthy existence. As a result, It's virtually impossible for anyone that works indoors to operate at their peak. Depression, obesity, and type 2 diabetes are at epidemic proportions and have all been shown to have links to sunlight deprivation. The resulting absenteeism, presenteeism and a general malaise in the workplace, as productivity demands continue to increase, has proven costly for employers and individuals alike.</p>

<p><strong>This is our second campaign on IndieGoGo.</strong></p>
<p>We've been fortunate to have the continuing support of our investors and the backers from our first successful campaign back in June of 2015. Unfortunately, we've had to work our way through several challenges over the past three years. Those challenges have prevented us from being able to ship the perks that our backers purchased during that campaign and we need your help to finally deliver those perks as well as the perks any new contributors select in this new campaign.</p>
<p>The issues we've persisted through, include:</p>
<p>1) Our contract manufacturer, Econis Labs outside of Atlanta, GA was acquired by a larger company that refused our business. Econis never shipped the units they were contracted to deliver in the Fall of 2016. Sun LifeLight had to purchase the additional material for a 100 unit build, find a new surface mount electronics contract manufacturer and raise the capital necessary to do so.</p>
<p>2) We took the opportunity during this new build, to improve the design including adding a touch screen display and a new power supply that increases the effective light output capacity.</p>
<p>3) Our original electronics distributor was unable to deliver the components we need for this new 100 unit build which allowed us the chance to work with Arrow Electronics and we couldn't be more satisfied with the partnership we're building!</p>
<p><strong>We are again, humbly asking for your help</strong> as we revolutionize the lighting industry by building smart, personal sunlight delivery systems specifically designed to be used at work, school or home by anyone that wants to operate at their peak!  </p>

Thank you for your interest!
About 5 years ago, we set off on a mission to bring the healthful benefits of the sun inside to help employers and employees alike, create healthy, exciting, energetic and productive work environments!
We’ve all heard how the sun is critical to our overall well-being…and how today’s society spends less and less time out in it. The lack of sunlight has had a profound effect on our healthfulness. “Reduced energy, performance, slowed metabolism, insomnia and even depression are part of a growing list of issues associated with this migration indoors. Wouldn’t it be great if you could improve your health and wellness naturally by simply bringing the sun to work with you?! Our young company allows you to do exactly that.
Summarily:
We build smart, personal lighting systems that pack the colored light spectrum of a bright, sunlit sky into a sophisticated and sexy desk lamp, used as you would an ordinary one, but that actually delivers the energizing benefits of the sun, indoors, where you need it most!
Our journey began with a love for the outdoors and the constant desire to be in the sun. 
Many of us continue to struggle through the gloomy winter months! We drew inspiration from these long dark days to ensure that although the harsh weather will inevitably return, thanks to the LifeLight Touch, many of us will be basking in the healthful benefits of the sun no matter what the weather, season or time of day.

After months of research and development with an exceptionally talented team of technologists and medical professionals, we were able to deliver the LifeLight Touch to an amazing collection of enterprise clients.
Those partners including TJX, BAE, Barclays, Digital Credit Union (DCU) and Todd & Weld, to name a few, provided valuable feedback that allowed us to optimize the production design. 
Now we need your help to make the LifeLight Touch a production reality!
Through your support and backing of this IndieGoGo campaign, not only will you receive the first and only natural, energy boosting, personal, sunlight delivery system, but your support will help Sun LifeLight make this life changing system available to all that spend so much of their day indoors, no matter where they live!
The system is purpose built for use by computer using office professionals, students and home based workers that spend most of their workday indoors. With this simple yet sophisticated and patent protected system, those that don't receive the energizing benefits of being in the sun while at work, can still gain those natural, energy amplifying, mood enhancing and productivity boosting attributes at or around their computer workstations!
Corporations and individuals alike, benefit by virtually transporting their workstations to sun drenched destinations!

Computer-using office professionals, students and home based workers do not receive enough sunlight during the workday to maintain a healthy existence. As a result, It's virtually impossible for anyone that works indoors to operate at their peak. Depression, obesity, and type 2 diabetes are at epidemic proportions and have all been shown to have links to sunlight deprivation. The resulting absenteeism, presenteeism and a general malaise in the workplace, as productivity demands continue to increase, has proven costly for employers and individuals alike.


Please, find the following report from Thomas Jefferson University Department of Neurology, that succinctly explains how humans are ""wired"" to benefit from the sun. 
The founders of the world renowned LEED Building Standard have developed the WELL Building Standard that focuses on the human centric side of interior spaces. Their standard speaks plainly about the need for ""Circadian Lighting"" as a cornerstone to improve employee health and wellness. The LifeLight Touch delivers more than the amount detailed in this lighting category. The simple solution: Bring the effective, soft, “sky blue” color of a bright sunny day to every workstation...The result, a happier, healthier and more productive workforce and or individual, within days.

A recent report by Shadab Rahman, PhD. from Brigham & Women's hospital Boston, MA shows how Sun LifeLight’s technology is at the forefront of this healthful, productivity boosting revolution.

System Overview
Used as you would an ordinary desk lamp, this unique system allows users to interactively decide exactly how much sun they feel they need on a daily basis. The LifeLight Touch (available now) allows a user to adjust the brightness and duration of light through a learning integrated touch screen. Simply adjust the levels with a swipe of your finger, position the light to shine down into your eyes from above (typically from behind and above a workstation display as pictured below) and out of your field of view. Start enjoying the energizing benefits of use within a few days. The LifeLight Learn (available soon) combined with the Sun Seeker App (available soon) uses a mobile application to control and monitor the light wirelessly, while the system actually gets smarter over time. Using its sophisticated algorithm, the app recommends the appropriate amount of sunlight each and every day based on a variety of inputs including weather, sleep quality, personal schedules and even favorite athletic team schedules.
LifeLight Touch...Stylish and Elegant Simplicity



High tech brushed aluminum desk lamp
Color selected LEDs
Controlled using simple swipes of a finger on a glass touchscreen panel built into the base
Infinitely adjust the brightness of the soft, sky blue light
Adjust the timer for up to 8 hours of use with a simple swipe of the finger
Uniquely flexible positioning system allows any user to direct the effective light into the eyes from above to eliminate glare, the way nature intended

SunSeeker App...Sophisticated Utility

SunSeeker App Available Soon 

Personalized Control and Monitoring Mobile App
Bluetooth connection to the LifeLight Learn
Provides individually Customized, daily recommended sunlight levels for maximum benefit
Built with proprietary algorithm using Multiple Internet of Things (IoT) inputs such as:
 Weather
 Personal schedule
Athletic team schedules
Wearable device data such as sleep quality, etc.


Interactive algorithm learns each users optimum sunlight levels for peak performance




The Only Effective Colored Wavelength -The LifeLight Touch (available now) delivers the only therapeutically effective wavelength of light ~480nm (sky blue). It therefore operates at far less intensity while being more effective than any other solution. 

Connected and Responsive App -The LifeLight Learn (available soon) is the first app controlled, “Internet of things” (IoT) connected lighting product that leverages a multitude of external sensor based inputs. No other product has the ability to automatically incorporate outside variables and user dynamics that directly impact the amount of sunlight that is most effective for each individual user. 

Customized Sunlight Algorithm -By learning each user’s personal preferences the Sun Seeker app (available soon) algorithmically calculates the optimum amount of sunlight each and every day. 

Reduces Light Pollution –In an office environment filled with competing visual stimuli (monitors, overhead lighting, etc.) the LifeLight Touch only adds the specific wavelength of light required and reduces visual stress. 

Ergonomic Design -Unlike other bulky and disruptive light therapy products it’s unique compact and flexible form factor was developed to direct the light down into the eye and out of the field of view, the way nature intended. Position the LifeLight Touch to shine down from above your computer display and you'll receive all of the effective light energy without even noticing the LifeLight Touch is there!

Teaching the DORN Method, a holistic manual therapy and true selfhelp method, since more than 15 years all over the world is a real passion and mission for me.</p><p>Sharing knowlege to help people is very fulfilling and also quite challenging at times because the world is full of mistrust and Ego focused.</p><p>Teaching Backpain selfhelp is great but realizing that most do not want to spend time and energy for their own health and prefer to give away the responsibility to others challenged me to develop something that motivates people to focus more on themselves as long as it is fast, effective and affordable. The result was the Spynamics Sacro Aligner helping people since 2008. The new product, the Spynamics Spine Aligner, will make this mission complete, allow many to become more independant from medications and therapies since Backpain is among the biggest health problems in the world.</p><p>Some of my partners in the development of my selfhelp tools, Dr. Jason Mallia from Sydney Australia (<a href=""https://www.integratedhealth.com.au/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.integratedhealth.com.au/</a>) and Dr. Wayne Sibson from Perth Australia (<a href=""https://www.spinefitosteopathy.com.au/index.asp"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.spinefitosteopathy.com.au/index.asp</a> help me as Medical advisors and researchers and ecouraged me all the way having themselves great results testing the tools with their patients.</p><p>I am calling on the crowdfunding community because I need your help to make these effective and easy to use Selfhelp Tools available to the many backpain sufferers around the world. The already established and successful Spynamics Sacro Aligner needs some small changes that require quite expensive mold adjustments and the NEW Spynamics Spine Aligner is basically ready developed but not yet produced and the necessary final stage is the most expensive to do (i.e. producing the mold, testing and production of the products)</p><p>Once finished there will be 3 options: The Spynamics Set (Sacro Aligner and Spine Aligner), or only the Sacro Aligner or only the new Spine Aligner.</p><p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p><p>To make the new Selfhelp tool available I would need around 25.000€ in order to have the products produced and ready for shipment.</p><p>The costs for the necessary production of the molds (15.000€ already), minimum stock for the warehouse (minimum 6000€), production of brochures, website and advertisement expenses may exceed the planed funds however private or bank loans can then do the rest if necessary.</p><p>Supporters of this campaign will get the products (the complete selfhelp set of Sacro Aligner and Spine Aligner with a retail value of 100€), sent to them anywhere in the world for only 60€ here on Indiegogo, guaranteed!</p><p><strong>The Impact</strong></p><p>Supporting this campaign will allow you to experience the incredible changes these products can make to your health.</p><p>A good part of the profits made with them will help to make the DORN Method available to the many Backpain sufferers worldwide and will be invested to improve web appearances, Information materials and a selfhelp exercise app free for all.</p><p>When I developed the successful Spynamics Sacro Aligner in 2007 I had no supporters at all and realized the whole project with a private loan. In 2008 the product achieved a gold medal award at the IENA the oldest fair for inventions in the world in Nuremberg, Germany.</p><p>Without advertisement efforts or any marketing experience I was able to sell several thousand of the product in countless countries on all continents.</p><p>Now with all the Internet possibilities, your help and social networks I see no reason why this new project should not be successful.</p><p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p><p>Informing people about the posibility to help themselves when experiencing Backpain is the biggest challenge because backpain is a huge money maker for many making a living with it and some may not like simple solutions.</p><p>I established a network of thousands of Dorn Method practitioners around the world and I plan and try to motivate these friends supporting this mission.</p><p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p><p>Many of my DORN Method Students and also backpain sufferers that I do not know live in countries that are still in development like India and if you cannot support this campaign financially you may be able to help by sharing the information about it also using all the Indiegogo share tools! The planed selfhelp app and other Information will also benefit you once it is ready.</p><p>About the products</p><p><strong>The Spynamics Sacro Aligner / Spine Aligner - Back Pain Solutions</strong></p><p>(The names comes from: <strong>Sp</strong>(inal) (D)<strong>ynamics Sacrum (Spine) Alignment</strong>)</p><p>The effective Back Pain Self Therapy tool was invented by the international Dorn Method Instructor and Health-Coach Thomas Zudrell, following the principles of the Dorn Method, a Holistic Manual Therapy and true Self Help Method, and Science from Osteopathy and Physical Therapy with advice from Dr Wayne Sibson,  B.Sc.(Clin.Sc.), MH.Sc.

Teaching the DORN Method, a holistic manual therapy and true selfhelp method, since more than 15 years all over the world is a real passion and mission for me.Sharing knowlege to help people is very fulfilling and also quite challenging at times because the world is full of mistrust and Ego focused.Teaching Backpain selfhelp is great but realizing that most do not want to spend time and energy for their own health and prefer to give away the responsibility to others challenged me to develop something that motivates people to focus more on themselves as long as it is fast, effective and affordable. The result was the Spynamics Sacro Aligner helping people since 2008. The new product, the Spynamics Spine Aligner, will make this mission complete, allow many to become more independant from medications and therapies since Backpain is among the biggest health problems in the world.Some of my partners in the development of my selfhelp tools, Dr. Jason Mallia from Sydney Australia (https://www.integratedhealth.com.au/) and Dr. Wayne Sibson from Perth Australia (https://www.spinefitosteopathy.com.au/index.asp help me as Medical advisors and researchers and ecouraged me all the way having themselves great results testing the tools with their patients.I am calling on the crowdfunding community because I need your help to make these effective and easy to use Selfhelp Tools available to the many backpain sufferers around the world. The already established and successful Spynamics Sacro Aligner needs some small changes that require quite expensive mold adjustments and the NEW Spynamics Spine Aligner is basically ready developed but not yet produced and the necessary final stage is the most expensive to do (i.e. producing the mold, testing and production of the products)Once finished there will be 3 options: The Spynamics Set (Sacro Aligner and Spine Aligner), or only the Sacro Aligner or only the new Spine Aligner.What We Need & What You GetTo make the new Selfhelp tool available I would need around 25.000€ in order to have the products produced and ready for shipment.The costs for the necessary production of the molds (15.000€ already), minimum stock for the warehouse (minimum 6000€), production of brochures, website and advertisement expenses may exceed the planed funds however private or bank loans can then do the rest if necessary.Supporters of this campaign will get the products (the complete selfhelp set of Sacro Aligner and Spine Aligner with a retail value of 100€), sent to them anywhere in the world for only 60€ here on Indiegogo, guaranteed!The ImpactSupporting this campaign will allow you to experience the incredible changes these products can make to your health.A good part of the profits made with them will help to make the DORN Method available to the many Backpain sufferers worldwide and will be invested to improve web appearances, Information materials and a selfhelp exercise app free for all.When I developed the successful Spynamics Sacro Aligner in 2007 I had no supporters at all and realized the whole project with a private loan. In 2008 the product achieved a gold medal award at the IENA the oldest fair for inventions in the world in Nuremberg, Germany.Without advertisement efforts or any marketing experience I was able to sell several thousand of the product in countless countries on all continents.Now with all the Internet possibilities, your help and social networks I see no reason why this new project should not be successful.Risks & ChallengesInforming people about the posibility to help themselves when experiencing Backpain is the biggest challenge because backpain is a huge money maker for many making a living with it and some may not like simple solutions.I established a network of thousands of Dorn Method practitioners around the world and I plan and try to motivate these friends supporting this mission.Other Ways You Can HelpMany of my DORN Method Students and also backpain sufferers that I do not know live in countries that are still in development like India and if you cannot support this campaign financially you may be able to help by sharing the information about it also using all the Indiegogo share tools! The planed selfhelp app and other Information will also benefit you once it is ready.About the productsThe Spynamics Sacro Aligner / Spine Aligner - Back Pain Solutions(The names comes from: Sp(inal) (D)ynamics Sacrum (Spine) Alignment)The effective Back Pain Self Therapy tool was invented by the international Dorn Method Instructor and Health-Coach Thomas Zudrell, following the principles of the Dorn Method, a Holistic Manual Therapy and true Self Help Method, and Science from Osteopathy and Physical Therapy with advice from Dr Wayne Sibson,  B.Sc.(Clin.Sc.), MH.Sc. (Osteo), Perth Australia who states:"" The Spynamics Sacro Aligner represents the first self help tool that actually simulates and replaces the hands of the therapist. It serves its goal to encourage and improve sacroiliac joint alignment by bringing the sacral base back into the ilia to decrease the strain on the sacroiliac ligaments. The Spynamics Sacro Aligner has helped improve my clinical outcomes with my patients and I recommend it to all my chronic low back pain sufferers"".Through applied physical laws, adjusted to the respective Anatomy and Physiology, long term results can be achieved in a simple and effective way.The Design follows the natural shape of the human sacrum and spinal column and when used properly can help to regain improved lumbopelvic and spinal alignment, muscle relaxation and improved nerve function.This versatile device is a fantastic therapy aid that all medical professionals and body workers should recommend to their patients.The Spynamics Selfhelp products:1.

<h3>Everybody Forgets Sometimes</h3>
<p>It's going to happen. You're going to forget to take your pills one day.</p>
<p>PillCall is a cap to go on your existing medicine bottle, with one goal: to make forgetting a thing of the past. Once set up, every time you take the cap off the bottle, it sends a signal through your wifi network to the server, and nothing happens. But when you forget, you don't take the cap off the bottle, it doesn't send a signal, and the server sends you a text to remind you. It can also send texts to your family if they help take care of you.</p>
<p>PillCall also helps you avoid double doses. We've all been there. You have the bottle in your hand, but you can't remember if you actually took your pill or not. If the cap sends the message twice, then the server texts you. Finally someone can answer that age-old question, ""did I take my pill already?""</p>
<p>Maybe it's your teenager, or a nosy houseguest, or a roommate, but some of us have trouble with people ""borrowing"" pills. Once they take one look at that telltale cap, now you can avoid those awkward situations where the pills come up short and all you have are suspicions.</p>
<h3>About PillCall</h3>
<p>PillCall is a new company, but draws on decades of experience. I'm excited to tell you about us.</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm Matt Channon, 42, Founder of PillCall. I'm a serial entrepreneur with a Master's from Georgia Tech and extensive expertise in both hardware and software. I've built electronics factories and I've built apps.</li>
<li>This isn't my first rodeo with a clever invention, but it is the first one I feel is special in terms of how much difference it'll make in everyday people's lives. People who would have gotten sick or died by forgetting their pills or forgetting they already took their pills, won't now.</li>
<li>Maybe you've been fortunate enough to never have yourself or a loved one been in a situation where a forgotten pill or double dosing meant a day ruined, but it sucks, knowing there's nothing you can do to ease their pain other than helping them wait it out. </li>
</ul>
<p>What do you get the person who has everything? They don't have one of these.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We've already designed and built prototypes, so we don't need to raise millions to make our first one. Here's more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>Once it ships, PillCall is going to cost $49 + $19/month monitoring fee. If you fund us, you pay less than half that to start. In fact, the $199 perk pays for itself in less than a year!</li>
<li>Five colors, two shapes available.</li>
<li>Free shipping, free replacement hardware exchange when your bottle size changes or the battery gets old.</li>
<li>Monitoring fee will never go up.</li>
<li>If we get enough volume we'll acquire a space and upgrade our equipment to include a couple of pick-and-place machines to knock the circuit boards out faster, and spin casters to knock out our plastic pieces. </li>
<li>Assembled in the USA, Ships from USA. Free shipping to US, $10 shipping to Rest of World.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Even if you just use it for doggie vitamins, think of the lives this product will save.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pill bottles kill more Americans than cars and firearms combined. 130 Americans die <i><strong><u>every day</u></strong></i> from opioid overdoses. While some of these are intentional, how many are simply acts of confusion or forgetfulness? Even if you're young, fit, and invincible, equipping your opioid pills with PillCall, alerting loved ones to a possible double dose could save your life.</li>
<li>For your older loved ones who live alone, think about falls.  A fall can leave them alone and on the floor for days until someone comes by to check on them. If they're incapacitated, they won't take their medication on time, meaning you get warned by default in a fraction of the time, and all without nagging your older loved ones when things are going fine.</li>
<li>The Internet of Things (IoT) has brought all kinds of solutions looking for a problem. By supporting PillCall, you can bring our optical pairing technology into the broader market, making IoT something everyday people can figure out.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There's always a measure of risk with any campaign, but we've derisked the product as much as possible. We've already assembled prototypes and gotten it to work.  Now our biggest challenges will be scaling and shipping on time. We believe in underpromising and overdelivering, because we want to dominate the 2 billion pill cap per year market.</p>
<ul>
<li>Even though the components don't make up much of the cost, this little piece of technology is still a radio, and radio is heavily regulated in nearly every country. For every model we produce, we need to spend thousands on FCC certifications, to make sure it plays nice with other radio devices. While presales should take care of the financials, this will add a few months to everybody's delivery time. We have a provider picked out and they have a solid track record.</li>
<li>The world is undergoing a capacitor shortage, and this means certain chip capacitors are facing months-long delays.  We only use about 6 per unit, and we're designing to use less-common, more-available capacitor values, to sail through this shortage and get you your pill caps on time.</li>
<li>Overwhelming demand would be a great problem to have, because that means our products will be making a difference in a large number of people's lives. Our circuit boards fly airfreight from China, along with many of the circuit components, but we're doing assembly in the US (outside California where we can afford the talent and space).</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Your Relatives Need This</h3>
<p>Maybe you've been blessed with perfect health, but as your family's tech expert, imagine being their health hero as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>Vrrp Vrrp! Make some noise about this, because too many suffer in silence when they miss their medication.</li>
<li>Use the Indiegogo share tools. You could save a Grandma's life, and you could save your friends' Grandmas' lives.</li>
</ul>
</div><p>We're very excited to bring this to you. Save the Grandmas!</p></div>","Everybody Forgets Sometimes

If we get enough volume we'll acquire a space and upgrade our equipment to include a couple of pick-and-place machines to knock the circuit boards out faster, and spin casters to knock out our plastic pieces. 
Assembled in the USA, Ships from USA. Free shipping to US, $10 shipping to Rest of World.


The Impact
Even if you just use it for doggie vitamins, think of the lives this product will save.

Pill bottles kill more Americans than cars and firearms combined. 130 Americans die every day from opioid overdoses. While some of these are intentional, how many are simply acts of confusion or forgetfulness? Even if you're young, fit, and invincible, equipping your opioid pills with PillCall, alerting loved ones to a possible double dose could save your life.
For your older loved ones who live alone, think about falls.  A fall can leave them alone and on the floor for days until someone comes by to check on them. If they're incapacitated, they won't take their medication on time, meaning you get warned by default in a fraction of the time, and all without nagging your older loved ones when things are going fine.
The Internet of Things (IoT) has brought all kinds of solutions looking for a problem. By supporting PillCall, you can bring our optical pairing technology into the broader market, making IoT something everyday people can figure out.


Risks & Challenges
There's always a measure of risk with any campaign, but we've derisked the product as much as possible. We've already assembled prototypes and gotten it to work.  Now our biggest challenges will be scaling and shipping on time. We believe in underpromising and overdelivering, because we want to dominate the 2 billion pill cap per year market.

Even though the components don't make up much of the cost, this little piece of technology is still a radio, and radio is heavily regulated in nearly every country. For every model we produce, we need to spend thousands on FCC certifications, to make sure it plays nice with other radio devices. While presales should take care of the financials, this will add a few months to everybody's delivery time. We have a provider picked out and they have a solid track record.
The world is undergoing a capacitor shortage, and this means certain chip capacitors are facing months-long delays.  We only use about 6 per unit, and we're designing to use less-common, more-available capacitor values, to sail through this shortage and get you your pill caps on time.
Overwhelming demand would be a great problem to have, because that means our products will be making a difference in a large number of people's lives. Our circuit boards fly airfreight from China, along with many of the circuit components, but we're doing assembly in the US (outside California where we can afford the talent and space).


Your Relatives Need This
Maybe you've been blessed with perfect health, but as your family's tech expert, imagine being their health hero as well.

Vrrp Vrrp! Make some noise about this, because too many suffer in silence when they miss their medication.
Use the Indiegogo share tools. You could save a Grandma's life, and you could save your friends' Grandmas' lives.

We're very excited to bring this to you. Save the Grandmas!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>#We Are Pepinster</b></p>
<p>As devoted fans of the 1st Belgian Division Basketball team from Verviers-Pepinster we’ve established lately the association named « We Are Pepinster ». This association has been created for the one and only purpose : Gathering all the fans from everywhere as well as all the citizens from our great region in order to serve a common cause, highly important to our hearts: the survival and continuation of our basketball team for the many more seasons to come.</p>
<p><b>The Oldest B-Ball Team in the belgian championship</b></p>
<p>For the record, this team of our hearts started its adventure in the Elite league of Belgium 30 years ago. 30 years during which many of us, many of you have been assisting, thrilled,<span>  taking part and even for some have been playing these games. </span></p>
<p><span>THE ONLY B-BALL TEAM in Wallonia (south part of Belgium) that remained in this league for so long and coming out of a small village (10,000 inhabitants).</span></p>
<p>THE OLDEST Basketball team of our basketball national federation. <b>The club had its 75<sup>th</sup> anniversary last season</b>.</p>
<p><span>Throughout the years the club has seen some of the greatest Belgian players<br/>playing for it as well as many young talented Americans, Croatians, Serbians,<br/>etc… A basketball club which also gave some of the best trainings to our young fellows. </span></p>
<p><span>This team gave us some great victories and battles on the ground in the belgian championship but in the european championship also.</span></p>
<p><b>06-30-2015 : Game Over ?</b><br/></p>
<p>This team, our team is facing new difficulties. Once again, despite giving us one of its best<span>  result out of the last 10 years, our club needs now to get the budget set up for the following championship. Without this one, our club would be resigned to stop all of this and slip into this slow but surely hurtful end of an era… With us witnessing it helpless…</span></p>
<p><b>Never give up !</b><br/></p>
<p>Helpless???Would you even consider it???Would you even dare thinking like this???</p>
<p>We, biggest fans of all, can’t and won’t let this happen without giving our best effort!!!</p>
<p><b>The B-Ball Team Verviers-Pepinster has to live! <br/>And Verviers-Pepinster will do so!!!</b></p>
<p><b>We Need You NOW !</b></p>
<p>Thanks to all of us, fans, friends, citizens, players from this club and others, coaches, sportsmen from all kinds, shopkeepers, relatives and more who still want to watch this club battling for the win. <b>WE CAN DO IT</b> !</p>
<p>In order to achieve this, our association <b>“We Are Pepinster”</b>, with the approval from the club’s shareholders, is launching several actions which will giving us the<br/>opportunity to ensure not just the following championship participation but<br/>most of the following ones to come (All of these actions are explained on our<br/>website <a href=""http://www.wearepepinster.be/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>www.wearepepinster.be</u></a>). </p>
<p><b>The Crowdfunding</b></p>
<p>One of these actions as you may now get it is going to be this crowdfunding. The principle is pretty simple: Through a donation based on the budget you’d agree to give us, you would then help our basketball team to earn the balance needed to pursue its activities. These donations may also give you the opportunity to get some counterparts, depending on the fixed conditions.</p>
<p>Each and everyone is free to decide the amount of its donation as for us any kind of those would be welcome and meaningful for all of us. We are hoping as well that through our counterparts to give you some great cheerfulness moments within our next championship.</p>
<p>We would also appreciate it if you would take some more of your time to spread this crowdfunding<span>  project among your contacts and this way help to reach some more people. </span></p>
<p><b>Thank you for your Help !</b> <b>Long life to the Wolves !</b></p>

#We Are Pepinster
As devoted fans of the 1st Belgian Division Basketball team from Verviers-Pepinster we’ve established lately the association named « We Are Pepinster ». This association has been created for the one and only purpose : Gathering all the fans from everywhere as well as all the citizens from our great region in order to serve a common cause, highly important to our hearts: the survival and continuation of our basketball team for the many more seasons to come.
The Oldest B-Ball Team in the belgian championship
For the record, this team of our hearts started its adventure in the Elite league of Belgium 30 years ago. 30 years during which many of us, many of you have been assisting, thrilled,  taking part and even for some have been playing these games. 
THE ONLY B-BALL TEAM in Wallonia (south part of Belgium) that remained in this league for so long and coming out of a small village (10,000 inhabitants).
THE OLDEST Basketball team of our basketball national federation. The club had its 75th anniversary last season.
Throughout the years the club has seen some of the greatest Belgian playersplaying for it as well as many young talented Americans, Croatians, Serbians,etc… A basketball club which also gave some of the best trainings to our young fellows. 
This team gave us some great victories and battles on the ground in the belgian championship but in the european championship also.
06-30-2015 : Game Over ?
This team, our team is facing new difficulties. Once again, despite giving us one of its best  result out of the last 10 years, our club needs now to get the budget set up for the following championship. Without this one, our club would be resigned to stop all of this and slip into this slow but surely hurtful end of an era… With us witnessing it helpless…
Never give up !
Helpless???Would you even consider it???Would you even dare thinking like this???
We, biggest fans of all, can’t and won’t let this happen without giving our best effort!!!
The B-Ball Team Verviers-Pepinster has to live! And Verviers-Pepinster will do so!!!
We Need You NOW !
Thanks to all of us, fans, friends, citizens, players from this club and others, coaches, sportsmen from all kinds, shopkeepers, relatives and more who still want to watch this club battling for the win. WE CAN DO IT !
In order to achieve this, our association “We Are Pepinster”, with the approval from the club’s shareholders, is launching several actions which will giving us theopportunity to ensure not just the following championship participation butmost of the following ones to come (All of these actions are explained on ourwebsite www.wearepepinster.be). 
The Crowdfunding
One of these actions as you may now get it is going to be this crowdfunding. The principle is pretty simple: Through a donation based on the budget you’d agree to give us, you would then help our basketball team to earn the balance needed to pursue its activities. These donations may also give you the opportunity to get some counterparts, depending on the fixed conditions.
Each and everyone is free to decide the amount of its donation as for us any kind of those would be welcome and meaningful for all of us. We are hoping as well that through our counterparts to give you some great cheerfulness moments within our next championship.
We would also appreciate it if you would take some more of your time to spread this crowdfunding  project among your contacts and this way help to reach some more people. 
Thank you for your Help ! Long life to the Wolves !

<p>Aero road bars can increase a cyclist’s efficiency in a considerable way.

<p>Made by an athlete for the athlete, we also designed a clip on aerobar to go with our aero stem.</p>
<p>Made with 4 parts rather than 2, the design is easier to assemble once and change fit and comfort without completely removing the bar bore clamps  The range of fit is wide in comparison with others on the market and it makes travel and mid-ride fit possible like never before.</p>

<p>Video of ease of installation coming soon.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Who we are.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Culprit Bicycles is a 100% family owned business. After 4 years of selling direct to consumer bikes we have decided to make a full switch to components.  Our previous experience was working for OEM factories consulting and offering design help.  We currently hold 4 patents and have won 2 IF Design awards. This experience has paved the way for new unique designs with premium manufacturers waiting on stand by to start production of these designs.</p>
<p><strong>But we NEED your help!</strong>The tooling cost of this project is large as we wish to meet the demands of you the riders by offering more stem lengths. This comes at a heavy cost for molds.  With your help, you will be able to help this 3 year project come true and help this family business to grow and expand.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By  supporting this campaign you help us open the tooling and offer to the world a unique and competitive product to compete against the Big player from a small family owned brand. The impact to you is you get a more aero set up and the impact to Culprit is the product reaches the market. Please do help.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Every campaign has its own inherent risks involved.  We foresee there may be some delays and set backs due to safety testing. As a very unique and different approach to aerobars, we will need to do very thorough testing of the design both by machine testing and riding testing to ensure that the product is safe to ride and will not put our loyal customers at risk.  In the event of any such delays we will be prompt to update our backers and let them know what that would mean for delivery and what we are doing to improve the product design.</p>

</div><p> </p></div>","Are you looking to clean up your front end?
Other than wheels, your Cockpit is one of the first places wind interacts with on your bike.  It's simply an overlooked part that can offer you the benefit of free speed.   Join Culprit by pre-ordering our new Covert Op cockpit components and improve the overall look of your bike in the process and get the added benefit of free speed!

 
Looking to Hide your Di2 Junction box?  Look at these Before and After Images of what this stem alone can do to help.

 
How does this work?  By hiding the junction box in the front of the bar bore allowing access to the function button from outside

How about mechanical shifting with cables?  The Covert Op cockpit can really clean up the front of the bike and help improve the airflow as well as make the bike look sleeker with cleaner lines.

Running full housing on a Tri bike or Road bike and want NO visible cables from the front. Covert Op stem can hide your cables and shifts smoothly even with mechanical TT shifters bending into the stem and directly into your frame.

 
Want to run an inner brake cable only on the front brake with less for the wind to see? The stem has a cable stop included that allows you to run bare cable to the front brake making the front of the bike as clean as possible.

How much faster does changing the stem make my bike you ask? 
Lets see what the wind tunnel results show of the Culprit Aero stem versus a standard stem.

The Covert Op Aero Stem saves a rider 3 watts on average over a typical alloy stem.
What about an aero road bar and  culprit stem versus a round bar and basic stem. 
The difference is staggering

Aero road bars can increase a cyclist’s efficiency in a considerable way. Utilizing the Culprit Covert Opt Aero Stem and an  aero drop bar a rider can become 5 watts more efficientfrom 0 to 10 degrees compared to a standard alloy stem. The integration of shift/brake cables and wires clean up the front of the bike offering a more aero front end and save rider 17 seconds of a 20 minute time trial at 30mph.
So what bikes was the Covert Op  stem designed for?


Stem Assembly- Any home mechanic can change it.

Made by an athlete for the athlete, we also designed a clip on aerobar to go with our aero stem.
Made with 4 parts rather than 2, the design is easier to assemble once and change fit and comfort without completely removing the bar bore clamps  The range of fit is wide in comparison with others on the market and it makes travel and mid-ride fit possible like never before.
 
 
Video of ease of installation coming soon.
 
The Fit of our bars is equal or better to the market leader Profile Design.  Based on the combination of our stem and clip on aerobars you get 2448 positions per stem length X 4 stems equaling near 10,000 positions.
Clip on as stand alone is 1632 combos, not including extension width change and the ease of assembly and travel.

Introducing H.O.M.E
- Driven by Medaino Healthcare
H.O.M.E (Hands On Monitoring Equipment) measures the body's vitals signs painlessly and precisely.  Functionality of the device includes the measurement of your:
Heart Rate
Blood Pressure
Electrocardiogram (ECG)
Blood Oxygen Content
Haemoglobin Content
Respiratory Rate
Body Temperature
This all-rounder device stores and analyzes the health data of each user (H.O.M.E features 8 separate user profiles). The user is alerted to any lifestyle adjustments  that are required in order to maintain a healthy, vibrant life.
Medaino Healthcare was formed in 2014. It's vision is to provide people with mobile, intelligent data that enables them to live a healthy, vibrant life. 
 
Medaino is featured in:
                                     
 
Globally, billions of people fall prey to serious illnesses that could have been avoided if they had corrected their lifestyles on time.
 
Imagine if you had a professional nurse with you all day, every day. His or her job would be to track your body's health indicators and advise you about your physical condition. In other words, what you should or shouldn't eat, and what you should or should not do in order to remain healthy. 
 
This nurse would most likely save your life in one way or another.
What would you need to pay this person? Exactly.
 
H.O.M.E does exactly this for a fraction of a nurse's monthly salary check. As a regular middle-class citizen, you will now be empowered to avoid the devastating effects of ""common"" chronic diseases and disorders like cardio-vascular disease, hypertension, low-blood pressure, hemoglobin deficits, sugar diabetes, etc.
 
H.O.M.E will prompt you to seek professional treatment and lead you to an early diagnosis. 
 

 
The configuration of Medaino's Hands On Monitoring Equipment:
 

 

 
 
 



 
How it works
 
H.O.M.E is powered by visible infrared and near-infrared spectroscopy technology. The blood flow pattern from the body is extracted from the photoplethysmograph.

<p align=""center""><strong>Ultimate CPAP Cleaner ™</strong></p>
<p align=""center""> </p>
<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>
<p>The Ultimate CPAP Cleaner ™ is a one-of-a-kind product created to help CPAP users around the world keep their CPAP supplies clean, in a convenient and healthy way.  Unlike other CPAP supplies cleaners, Ultimate CPAP Cleaner ™ uses water and a gentle detergent to ensure a safe and effective clean.  Ultimate CPAP Cleaner ™ is also much safer for your health than other products that use ionized air (ozone) for cleaning.  Ozone is a known free-radical, cancer-causing agent. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>Hi, I’m Dr. Raj Kakar, inventor of the Ultimate CPAP Cleaner ™, and I am a Sleep Health specialist based in Dallas, TX.  I see patients every day who are diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea and who use CPAP treatment.  Having seen thousands of patients over the years, one of the biggest challenges our patients have had was finding a convenient way to keep their CPAP supplies clean on a regular basis.  </p>
<p>Many people simply don’t clean them as often as they should, which increases the risk of infections.  The Ultimate CPAP Cleaner ™ fits neatly underneath your bathroom sink and connects easily to your plumbing.  That means no more unsightly equipment next to your bed for cleaning your CPAP!    Plus, the Ultimate CPAP Cleaner ™ cleans your hose, mask, and water chamber all at one time!  Just set it and go!  (Small pre-measured detergent packets make it even more convenient.) When you return, your PAP supplies are nice and freshly clean! Other CPAP cleaners use ionized air (aka ozone) to make cleaning convenient, but these devices may significantly increase the risk of cancer development.  Ozone is harmful to our health and to our environment. The Ultimate CPAP Cleaner™ uses ONLY real soap and water, so you get a better, safer clean!</p>
<p>That’s why I developed the idea of the Ultimate CPAP Cleaner ™, to conveniently and safely clean CPAP supplies for healthy sleep. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We are looking for $150,000 in funding for product development, engineering, testing, and start-up costs.  These funds will help us bring the concept to reality.  As we make progress, we may seek further funding if needed for further product development, marketing, and sales.  If we do not reach our goal, the funds will still be used for product development, engineering, and testing. </p>
<p>The retail price for the Ultimate CPAP Cleaner ™ will be $299.  But for our campaign supporters, we will offer discounted pricing.  In fact, if you donate $25, you will get a voucher for 5% off the product when it comes to market.  If you donate between $50, you will get a voucher for 10% off the product when ready for market.  If you donate $100, you will get a voucher for 25% off the product.  If you donate $150, you will get a voucher for 40% off the product.  If you donate $200, you will get a voucher for 60% off the product.  For all donations of $300, you will qualify for one free product device and you will be one of the first people on the planet to get the Ultimate CPAP Cleaner ™!  Plus, for donations of $300 or more, we will give you free shipping.  For donations of $600, you will qualify for <u>two</u> free product devices, free shipping, and 6 months’ supply of free gentle detergent tablets!  For donations of $1,000, you will qualify for <u>three</u> free product devices, free shipping, and one year’s supply of free gentle detergent tablets. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges people with sleep apnea face is finding a convenient way to keep their CPAP supplies clean on a regular basis.  Handwashing CPAP supplies at least 1-2 times per week can be an inconvenient and time-consuming task.  Many people don’t clean them as often as they should, which increases the risk of infections and health problems.  Other CPAP cleaners on the market use ionized air (ozone), but these devices may significantly increase the risk of cancer development.  Plus, ozone is harmful to our environment. </p>
<p>So I developed the idea of the Ultimate CPAP Cleaner ™ to conveniently clean CPAP supplies for healthy sleep.  By contributing to our campaign, you will help millions of CPAP users around the world save time cleaning their CPAP supplies and ensure that they keep their CPAP treatment sanitary and reduce the risk of infection.  Plus, you will actually benefit our world’s environment by helping people move away from current products that use ionized air (ozone) for cleaning.  Ozone is a known free-radical, cancer-causing agent.  Ozone is harmful not only to our environment, but also to our health.  Less ozone in the air is better for everyone and our planet! </p>
<p>I have developed other successful products on the market.  One product, called the Ultimate Pillow ™, has helped many people get a better’s night’s sleep by promoting comfortable support.  The Ultimate Pillow ™ helps people to get the ideal head and neck support to ensure optimal spine alignment for an improved quality sleep.  It is also a one-of-a-kind product that provides the right amount of support for both back and side sleepers.  Sales of Ultimate Pillow ™ are taking off, and we plan to roll out other sizes and models to meet the needs of various types of sleepers (with a special line designed for women).  Our company has a proven track record for success. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Risk &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>The biggest challenges that we face in developing our product are funding, development, and manufacturing.  Funding is our first and biggest challenge.  But with the help of crowdfunding, we should be able to overcome this obstacle.  Once we have the funding, development will be the next biggest hurdle.  We will need to find good contacts in engineering and development that can create the product we have imagined.  Some issues related to development may be limitation on the size of the product, because we want to keep the product small enough to be placed underneath your bathroom sink.  But we will consult with several groups of engineers and designers to achieve the goals we have set.  Once we have developed the prototype, then manufacturing should be the easiest of our challenges.  We will just have to find the best manufacturer for our type of product.  I am a big believer in if you can dream it, you can achieve it! </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>In addition to contributing to our campaign, there are other ways you can help.  Please help us get the word out and make some noise about our campaign!  Also, remember you can use the Indiegogo share tools to pass the message along!    We truly appreciate your help in supporting our campaign to make this dream a reality, and to help people around the world live happier, healthier lives! </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>For more than 2 years, my colleagues and I have studied insomnia. Why do we fall asleep at different times? What happens in the first seconds of sleep? We are the first ones to decide to approach this issue scientifically and here are our results. Here is the solution – “Dream pillow”. With our development you can guarantee to fall asleep within 3-8 minutes. This is possible thanks to 24 sensors installed into the pillow, a wave generator, a frequency amplifier and a processor that controls everything. You just need to click on ""Start"" and the rhythms of ""Dream pillow"" will synchronise with your mind to the world of dreams! </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The updated line of Dream Pillow is the culmination of years of re-design and testing. We are on Indiegogo to raise funds for ordering new inventory and building a team to take this unique product from its clinical origins to a pillow which is both effective and extremely comfortable.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">We hope you’ll give it a try by supporting the campaign and joining our Dream Pillow community!</p>

<div> </div>
<div>Regardless of race, age and sex, our brain works in certain rhythms. ""Dream pillow"" with the help of 24 sensors and detectors reproduces the rhythms for relaxation of mind and immersion in sleep. We literally make our brain relax and properly synchronise with the delta and theta waves. Just pressing ""Start"" regardless of fatigue, stress at work, quarrel with your beloved or change regime, you fall asleep to a good and tight dream in 3-8 minutes. </div>

<div>One of the best things in ""Dream pillow"" is, of course, ease of use. You just need to press the button and select the mode. Next, the processor will do everything for you. There were certainly ideas to score with gadgets like many others, but we refused it. The only thing that we added to our development past the main one is a vibro alarm clock. It will not allow you to sleep more than 8 hours, slowly and pleasantly increasing the rhythm frequency, you will pleasantly wake up with a smile.</div>

</div></div>","Short Summary
For more than 2 years, my colleagues and I have studied insomnia. Why do we fall asleep at different times? What happens in the first seconds of sleep? We are the first ones to decide to approach this issue scientifically and here are our results. Here is the solution – “Dream pillow”. With our development you can guarantee to fall asleep within 3-8 minutes. This is possible thanks to 24 sensors installed into the pillow, a wave generator, a frequency amplifier and a processor that controls everything. You just need to click on ""Start"" and the rhythms of ""Dream pillow"" will synchronise with your mind to the world of dreams! 
The updated line of Dream Pillow is the culmination of years of re-design and testing. We are on Indiegogo to raise funds for ordering new inventory and building a team to take this unique product from its clinical origins to a pillow which is both effective and extremely comfortable.
We hope you’ll give it a try by supporting the campaign and joining our Dream Pillow community!


 

 
Regardless of race, age and sex, our brain works in certain rhythms. ""Dream pillow"" with the help of 24 sensors and detectors reproduces the rhythms for relaxation of mind and immersion in sleep. We literally make our brain relax and properly synchronise with the delta and theta waves. Just pressing ""Start"" regardless of fatigue, stress at work, quarrel with your beloved or change regime, you fall asleep to a good and tight dream in 3-8 minutes. 
 

 

One of the best things in ""Dream pillow"" is, of course, ease of use. You just need to press the button and select the mode. Next, the processor will do everything for you. There were certainly ideas to score with gadgets like many others, but we refused it. The only thing that we added to our development past the main one is a vibro alarm clock. It will not allow you to sleep more than 8 hours, slowly and pleasantly increasing the rhythm frequency, you will pleasantly wake up with a smile.
The main thing is to fall asleep, witch ""Dream pillow"" perfectly copes with. And no matter where you decide to fall asleep, in a car, on a mountain or a hotel, ""Dream pillow"" will provide a full and healthy sleep.
 

 

Our engineers installed 24 sensors and 8 sensors that generate theta, delta waves, and, depending on the mode you choose, reproduce binaural beats. ""Dream pillow"" works in 3 modes:

1. The first mode - synchronises your brain to the purity of 4-8 Hz, relaxing it.2. The second mode -synchronises your brain to a purity of 1-4 Hz, immersing in sleep.3. The third mixed cycle - synchronises your brain to purity from 15 and lowers to 3-4 Hz, for a deep sleep.

<h3><strong>Company Overview:</strong></h3>
<p>Nxtbed was founded with a disruptive spirit and a visionary objective: to truly place the customer first by creating personalized mattresses that embrace the unique sleep needs of each individual.   Our goal is to improve your overall quality of sleep, resulting in better daily performance and long-term health. </p>
<p>Every Nxtbed is custom built from the ground up for each individual client.  We start by analyzing your body dimensions, which can be done in the comfort of your own home via smartphone, tablet, or Microsoft Kinect.  This analysis includes measurements of your height, weight, shoulder and hip dimensions, and sleeping position.   Using a proprietary algorithm inspired by our scientific approach, Nxtbed utilizes multiple segments and layers of differing densities throughout your mattress to help you achieve spinal alignment and therefore optimal sleep.  The result is a perfect, custom fit mattress for you and your partner based on your respective body profiles.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">   <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504737126/v9lnigs70mcaep7h7lyt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/> .  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504737153/qsleoxif2aind5dq8f6l.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Over time our bodies will change, and as our lives and circumstances fluctuate, so too will our sleeping habits.   These changes may be a pregnancy, an athletic injury, or even a medical condition that necessitates a change in your mattress.   The segments and layers within your Nxtbed mattress can be seamlessly changed in and out based on your new body profile or circumstance, all within the comfort of your home.   Every Nxtbed comes with a<strong> Lifetime Warranty</strong>, so these modifications come at no cost to you.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504736850/ge4ppjxitwdgyrvhpw2g.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/> .    <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504736870/m2dmgrkmmidthn1jwzns.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Every Nxtbed product is made and manufactured in Connecticut with the help of our partners at KTT Enterprises, LLC and Talalay Global Inc.   All Nxtbed products are hypoallergenic, antimicrobial, and environmentally friendly.   </p>

<h3>Our Mission</h3>
<p>Nxtbed is seeking to raise capital through this crowd-funding campaign. The money raised will serve a dual purpose:</p>
<p>Half of the total funds raised will go towards further production and development of Nxtbed products. We plan on using campaign contributions to grow our business, and to develop innovative sleep technologies such as our proprietary sleep monitoring system and body profiling process. We’ll also use these contributions to increase brand awareness and further our marketing efforts.</p>
<p> The other half of the funds raised will go to our partners at the Connecticut Chapter of the Alzheimer’s Association. This is a cause near to the heart of the Nxtbed team, and those afflicted with Alzheimer’s disease have personally impacted each of us in some way. We are proud to partner with our friends at the Alzheimer’s Association as we aid them in finding a cure for this disease. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Impact of Poor Sleep</h3>
<p>The evidence is clear; sleep deficiency and poor quality sleep can lead to long-term health problems. Studies show that sleep deficiency <a href=""https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/sdd/why"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">alters activity in the brain</a>. This leads to poor decision-making, slow reaction time, difficulty solving problems, and trouble controlling emotions.</p>
<p>In addition to the cognitive issues we encounter resulting from poor quality sleep, we also put ourselves at <a href=""https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/sdd/why"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">further risk of heart disease</a>, kidney disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and stroke.</p>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
</div><div>
<p>One of the biggest challenges we will encounter in this campaign is helping people understand the role that quality sleep plays in their daily lives, whether it’s in the boardroom or on the athletic field. After several nights of disruptive sleep, the impact on your daily performance will be significant.</p>
<p>While we normally relate the benefits of quality sleep to young professionals and adults, the truth is that it begins at a much younger age. Deep sleep <a href=""https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/sdd/why"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">supports healthy growth and development</a>, boosting muscle mass, helping to repair cells, and improving memory in children and teens.</p>
<p>We know that you need to be at your sharpest each and every day, which is why we’ve enlisted the experts to ensure you get the quality of sleep that you deserve.</p>
<p>Our founder, Bob Zukowski, has over 15 years of experience in the mattress industry, including work with all of the major bedding brands. Bob is an expert when it comes to sleep; his goal with NxtBed is to deliver an optimal level of sleep for peak performance, all while creating long-lasting relationships with all of our customers.</p>

IASO Ultra is your own personal pain relief device with futuristic technology to help damaged tissue recovery and improve blood flow, thus treating your pain effectively.IASO Ultra combines low level laser technology, blue LED therapy, heat therapy and vibration massage to create a unique synergy to treat various pains in various areas of the body.    Living in a time where social distancing is required, a visit to the doctor’s office may not be the most ideal choice. Contactless treatments are encouraged; however, pain care and management isn’t simply a one-time annual check-up. Pain treatment takes multiple visits to the chiropractor, physical therapists and massage therapists.  With IASO Ultra, you will be able to receive medical level treatment in the comfort of your home with a small, compact yet mighty gadget that works wonders.   Also known as low-level laser technology, cold laser therapy stimulates the regeneration of tissues by increasing blood flow to the applied area and thus  contributes to effective pain relief with no side effects.With a trifecta of pain relief wavelengths of 650nm, 830nm and 910nm, this specific therapy works to reach into the deepest areas of the damaged tissues to promote relief.  Often used to treat sun damage and various skin conditions, blue LED therapy helps with blood flow improvement in superficial areas. The LED wavelength of 453nm and the triple wavelengths of the cold laser therapy work together for even a quicker pain relief--especially in tackling larger areas and deeper pains.  Along with the laser and LED therapy, heat activates in IASO Ultra to add on to the improvement of blood circulation . Heat therapy can relax and soothe muscles while healing damaged tissues.  For a comprehensive massage experience, vibrations and rhythmic vibrations complete the full package. Vibration adds the final touch in the therapy to enhance the process of helping the expansion of blood vessels for an overall speedy recovery.   These four features work together to create the most advanced therapy and pain relief experience that no other pain management device can offer. Not only that, IASO Ultra carries these sleek features as well.      The device weighs only 220 grams, or roughly half a pound and is only 3.4 x 6 x 1 inch size. Considering the jam packed technology, IASO Ultra is truly light and compact, yet mighty.  IASO Ultra is wearable with its wearable band. Experience a hands-free contactless therapy--something that no other personal cold laser device can deliver. Plus with its light weight, you can wear it around anywhere for quick on-the-go relief! IASO Ultra was specifically designed to treat larger surface areas that generally require more attention, such as the shoulder, lower back and thigh area. IASO Ultra is on par to medical grade therapy. Cold laser is globally used for pain relief by chiropractors and physicians. You would have easy access to your very own personal medical level pain management therapy for an affordable price. Whenever you feel tension or pain, pop out your IASO Ultra and attach it on to wherever your body is calling.  The long lasting battery can be charged via a charging cable or the charging cradle.     Treat the pains from bad posture, repeated use of joints, and various sport activities at the comfort of your own home with medical grade laser therapy--especially during this time of uncertainty.      We released IASO back in 2019 as a cold laser therapy device that is small, compact yet mighty.

<p>On April 16th, 2002 I am lacing up my sneakers and running the Boston Marathon to raise money for the American Cancer Society as part our family team fundraising for the Relay For Life where I participate with my family team in St. Albans, Vermont. I am taking on this challenge of my life in honor of my friends Susan Silodor, Marietta Stevens, and Bev Gross of Cheyenne Wyoming. Each one of these special people has survived cancer because of their positive attitude and the breakthroughs in cancer research funded by American Cancer Society. This is my third Boston and it will be the most memorable because of the courage and strength of these special survivors behind me. I qualified with the Hartford Marathon in October of 2000, with a 3:40 marathon qualifier time. This will be my 15th marathon since 1989.</p>
<p>Now, your part is easy. All you need to do is commit to sponsoring me. My part is a little tougher, I've committed to raising $2,620 for the American Cancer Society by completing the 26.2 miles-- no matter how long it takes. Please donate as generously as you can by sending in your check payable to the American Cancer Society to the address below. Just in case you need a little extra motivation to sponsor me, here are a few reasons.</p>

<p>The 20 Countries Where People Get Kidnapped The Most The proportion of global kidnappings from Latin America has halved since 2005, but Mexico still leads the pack, according to Risk Map 2014, a new report from Control Risks. Asia and the Pacific had the most recorded kidnaps-for-ransom in 2013, up to 35% of global cases from 31% in 2012. Risks remain in Africa, especially in Nigeria where ""the overwhelming majority of incidents taking place in the oil-producing Niger delta."" ""A large number of cases continued to be reported in the Middle East, fuelled by the unstable security environment created by the Syrian civil war,"" according to the report. ""Kidnapping-for-ransom has become a common problem in Syria and Lebanon, with Lebanon ranking sixth in Control Risks’ global top ten in 2013."" Here are the top 20 countries for kidnap-for-ransom in absolute terms for 2013 (as of September 30): 1. Mexico 2. India 3. Nigeria 4. Pakistan 5. Venezuela 6. Lebanon 7. Philippines 8. Afghanistan 9. Colombia 10. Iraq 11. Syria 12. Guatemala 13. Yemen 14. Libya 15. Egypt 16. Brazil 16. Kenya (tied) 18. Nepal 19. Malaysia 19. South Africa (tied) To contextualize, Control Risks said that the n  With over 875,000 children reported missing in the United States in just the last year, this low-cost device will help families concerned about the whereabouts of their children, teens, elderly parents (including Alzheimer's patients) by enabling them to keep tabs on their loved ones' locations at any given time. One of the many programming capabilities of this device will allow the family to set distance parameter guidelines, such that once the wearer of the device (for example, a young child) travels beyond a set distance from the ""base"" unit, the remote unit is automatically activated to alert the ""home base"" unit (a cell phone, PDA or computer) of the child's location, direction and speed of travel. This will be a great asset in assisting law enforcement agencies in recovering missing persons within minutes. Statistics from the FBI indicate that missing children who are murdered are usually killed within three hours of abduction. The RQM Technologies Personal Tracking Device (PTD) will save lives, by immediately alerting the ""base"" unit, aiding in timely tracking and rescue by law enforcement agencies. Another programming capability is the ability to download all medical information, contact information, emergency numbers, etc., in the event an individual is found incapacitated, allowing emergency teams to treat a patient effectively, while alerting the guardian of her child's, parent's, or pet's whereabouts. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a footwear more particularly a foot wear with multi features. DETAIL DESCRIPTIONS OF THE INVENTION preferred embodiment of the present invention, it’s a multifunctional shoe. The main purpose of the invention is to save lives and help to minimize kidnapping. It utilizes on star tracking/or another type of tracking company to locate your loved one. In addition the War Sparrow shoe vacuum sucks around the victims feet tightly so that the attacker or the victim can’t take it off until police arrive, while in alert mode the shoes external shell is electrically charged with the voltage of police stun-gun so if the predator tries to take them off, he gets paralyzed by the voltage and the victim is given enough time to get away. In a second aspect of the present invention, War Sparrow has a beats/or another high quality electronic speaker system on one side in addition to the speaker system, the War Sparrow also has a touchscreen video player on the other side, it also acts as a GPS system utilizing the blue tooth tech located under the back sole. This small head set interacts with the pedestrian with a list of commands directing him/her to his/her selected location by voice recognition tech,blinkers are installed on the front and back of the shoe like a car to show the way. The War Sparrow will save lives using star tech or another type of tracking company, when the victim is attacked he/she presses a button located on either their wrist or manually on their shoe. It comes with an app download that allows you to locate your child/loved one with on-star satellite using your smart phone. You can also communicate with the victim with speaker system and listen to the victim surroundings There is also an alarm as loud as a fire truck that sounds as soon as the  button hit,also the War Sparrow alerts other shoes that are in the area and takes a sitting report and sends it to the police and family members with the  convenient app so no more flier's and relaying on people to report a sitting . The War Sparrow shoe is heat resistant, fire resistant, cut resistant, can be submerged in water with no damages to the electrical system. The War Sparrow is a solar powered device, also it uses the same usb port responsible for downloading the music to the shoe to energize the charge pack located in the sole. Solar is located on the front top and on the back of the shoe. There is a jamming device which would be embedded in the bottom of the shoe that would disable any electrical devices from working like a car/cell phone/walkie talkie or any electrical device. So that the kidnappers car and cellphone or anyone else's he tries to use does not work. In another aspect of the present invention there would be a wristband for control and operate the shoe in addition to the manual control panel located on the shoe. There would be a small hidden high definition camera also, on the front of the shoe. While a preferred embodiment of the present invention has been shown and described, it will be apparent shown and described, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that many changes and modifications may be made without departing from the invention in its broader aspect.<br/></p>

The War Sparrow will save lives using star tech or another type of tracking company, when the victim is attacked he/she presses a button located on either their wrist or manually on their shoe. It comes with an app download that allows you to locate your child/loved one with on-star satellite using your smart phone. You can also communicate with the victim with speaker system and listen to the victim surroundings There is also an alarm as loud as a fire truck that sounds as soon as the  button hit,also the War Sparrow alerts other shoes that are in the area and takes a sitting report and sends it to the police and family members with the  convenient app so no more flier's and relaying on people to report a sitting . The War Sparrow shoe is heat resistant, fire resistant, cut resistant, can be submerged in water with no damages to the electrical system. The War Sparrow is a solar powered device, also it uses the same usb port responsible for downloading the music to the shoe to energize the charge pack located in the sole. Solar is located on the front top and on the back of the shoe. There is a jamming device which would be embedded in the bottom of the shoe that would disable any electrical devices from working like a car/cell phone/walkie talkie or any electrical device. So that the kidnappers car and cellphone or anyone else's he tries to use does not work. In another aspect of the present invention there would be a wristband for control and operate the shoe in addition to the manual control panel located on the shoe. There would be a small hidden high definition camera also, on the front of the shoe. While a preferred embodiment of the present invention has been shown and described, it will be apparent shown and described, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that many changes and modifications may be made without departing from the invention in its broader aspect.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hi, I’m JodiAnn Stevenson and I’m most HAPPY as a Mermaid</p>
<p>and I’m on a mission to bring Mermaid Tails into the world
of Fitness in the U.S.!</p>
<p>You, I know (because you are reading this) are, AWESOME!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1271199/files/20150305094714-FullSizeRender__7_.jpg?1425577634"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Positive Psychologists tell us that our brains and bodies
work better when we’re HAPPY! 
Neuroscientists tell us that doing exercise in new, novel ways is one of
the best ways to make ourselves HAPPY! </p>

<p>Last summer just before I completed my ACE group fitness
certification and my AEA aquatics fitness professional certification, it dawned
on me that the world of U.S. Fitness is perfectly ripe for a new, novel and
exciting trend that has already started to develop in other parts of the world.  </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1271644/files/20150305124107-FullSizeRender__22_.jpg?1425588067"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>So, my mission emerged: 
To design a workout that people could do in a Mermaid tail that would be
challenging and fun – and would, ultimately, be more than just donning a tail
and splashing around aimlessly in the water (which, for the record, is also
fun).  </p>
<p>Then, my mission began taking shape:  I developed The Mermaid Workout ™ and have
started teaching it in one-on-one training sessions with clients, just to test
it further and walk real participants through the process.  But, The Mermaid Workout ™ is definitely
ready to be taught to whole groups of 10-15 participants at a time.  And in order to start offering The Mermaid
Workout ™ to whole groups, I need a whole set of tails.  </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1271628/files/20150305122908-FullSizeRender__21_.jpg?1425587348"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>The novelty of The Mermaid Workout ™ makes people HAPPY –

<p>So, I am running this indiegogo campaign in order to fund my
first set of tails to be used in The Mermaid Workout ™.  I have already found a reputable supplier of
high quality tails from whom I will purchase these tails.  Once I have this set of tails, I will begin
offering The Mermaid Workout in aquatic facilities, at least, throughout
Michigan, particularly in my region of Mid-Michigan. </p>

<p>I’m certain that offering these classes will quickly have a
snowball effect.  The Mermaid Workout
™  is an awesome workout!  Participants feel powerful and stunning when
they do it.  They feel “natural” and
“graceful” and “beautiful” and “strong.” 
These are actually words participants have used to describe the
experience.  I have already developed a
training module for other future Mermaid Fitness ™ instructors.  Within a year’s time, I anticipate the need
to license at least a handful of other instructors to help me keep up with the
demand of offering these classes.  I have
also developed a couple of top secret products to make The Mermaid Workout ™ as
effective and successful as possible. 
These top secret products are currently being jumped through some legal
hoops before they will be ready to launch and added to the Mermaid Fitness ™
experience but they are definitely on their way!</p>
<p>And we have bigger plans beyond that… but that’s the
starting point… buying this first set of tails is essentially the start-up cost
for what could ultimately become nothing short of a revolution in the world of
fitness. </p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The standard GPS devices found in our phones or cars work with precision of meters, This is normally acceptable if we use them for standard navigation, but not enough if we want to jump to other applications.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Several
 methods have been developed in the last years in order to increase the 
precision from meters to centimeters or even millimeters. One of these 
methods is called RTK (Real Time Kinematic), and it is based on 
combining the signals of two GPS devices at same time.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">RTKWARE is designed for:</p>

<h4>#1 Player monitoring </h4>
<p>A football player wears the UBR1 device in the arm. The GPS data is received and sent to a laptop. The data is processed in real time by the open source RTK software <a href=""www.rtklib.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""www.rtklib.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rtklib</a>. As mentioned, in an RTK system, two devices are needed to compute the precision solution, so the software is configured to get the second signal from a real time reference station from an internet server. </p>

<p>As you
 can see in the video, the player position is clearly defined and is 
obtained in real time. With this data, the number of parameters that can
 be calculated is huge: <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul>
<li><div align=""justify"">Total distance</div></li>
<li><div align=""justify"">Velocity (average / max)</div></li>
<li><div align=""justify"">Acceleration (average / max)</div></li>

</ul>
<br/><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Think how valuable this data can be for any professional athlete or coach.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4>#2 Vehicle Monitoring</h4>
<p>In that case, two UBR1 has been used. One in a static known postition and the other placed in a car, Similarly to the previous test, both signals are processed by the rtklib software. </p>

<p></p>
<p>The RTK world has been reserved until now to very expensive professional equipment (thousands dollars). It is mainly due to the fact that many different electronic areas are involved in a RTK design: radio stages, GNSS stages, computing, powering among others... and they have to be perfectly adjusted to achieve good precision. </p>
<p>In order to make it affordable, there has been a relevant response from the low cost market. We have recently seen alternatives that solves the problem partially, but they can be frustrating if you don´t have solid electronic knowledge. Generally speaking, you still have to connect several boards with cables, charge the bateries by your own and putting everything in an enclosure with glue... </p>Aware of this, <b>RTKWARE gathers all the elements to avoid you have to deal with cables and can focus with your application: </b><br/><p><b><br/></b></p>

<h3 style=""text-align: justify;"">How Does it Work?</h3>
<div>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A standard positioning device (phones, car...) receives the signal from the
American global positioning system (GPS) constellation. The signals are treated
by an algorithm with support of an installed map, computing a position solution
with accuracy of meters. Adding some other correction technics and reception of
signals from other global satellites systems as GLONASS (Russia), GALILEO
(Europe) or Beidou (China), the accuracy cannot be better than 1m in best
cases.</p>

</div><br/></div>","RTKWARE is a friendly and affordable positioning system based on Real Time Kinematics. It is able to achieve centimeter accuracy for real time tracking applications.
Welcome to the precision 
The standard GPS devices found in our phones or cars work with precision of meters, This is normally acceptable if we use them for standard navigation, but not enough if we want to jump to other applications.
Several
 methods have been developed in the last years in order to increase the 
precision from meters to centimeters or even millimeters. One of these 
methods is called RTK (Real Time Kinematic), and it is based on 
combining the signals of two GPS devices at same time.
RTKWARE is designed for:


Makers
App developers
GIS Software users
Drone users (Open Pilot)
Precision Agriculture Farmers
RTK Researchers


What is UBR1?


The RTKWARE module UBR1 is a low cost multi-constellation receiver with integrated antenna and built-in 3km-range RF modem.  
.


It has been designed for the user, and includes elements as charger manager, USB interface, rechargeable battery, and enclosure among others. It is friendly, wearable, and ready to use.  
You will need nothing else than your laptop to start testing your applications based on RTK technology, forget about the hardware issues and focus on developing your project.
--> Download UBR1 Datasheet

Application examples
#1 Player monitoring 
A football player wears the UBR1 device in the arm. The GPS data is received and sent to a laptop. The data is processed in real time by the open source RTK software Rtklib. As mentioned, in an RTK system, two devices are needed to compute the precision solution, so the software is configured to get the second signal from a real time reference station from an internet server. 

As you
 can see in the video, the player position is clearly defined and is 
obtained in real time. With this data, the number of parameters that can
 be calculated is huge: 


Total distance
Velocity (average / max)
Acceleration (average / max)
Detect patterns (fatigue, overeffort...)

Think how valuable this data can be for any professional athlete or coach.

#2 Vehicle Monitoring
In that case, two UBR1 has been used. One in a static known postition and the other placed in a car, Similarly to the previous test, both signals are processed by the rtklib software. 

Once again, a lot of applications can derive from here: 


Parking control

Unmanned vehicles

Access control
Fleet management
Navigation
System synchronization

What is the difference between the RTKWARE UBR1 and other low cost RTK devices?

The RTK world has been reserved until now to very expensive professional equipment (thousands dollars). It is mainly due to the fact that many different electronic areas are involved in a RTK design: radio stages, GNSS stages, computing, powering among others... and they have to be perfectly adjusted to achieve good precision. 
In order to make it affordable, there has been a relevant response from the low cost market. We have recently seen alternatives that solves the problem partially, but they can be frustrating if you don´t have solid electronic knowledge. Generally speaking, you still have to connect several boards with cables, charge the bateries by your own and putting everything in an enclosure with glue... Aware of this, RTKWARE gathers all the elements to avoid you have to deal with cables and can focus with your application: 



Features



Multi-constellation receiver
500mW Medium Power UHF Radio Modem (free band 915MHz US, 868MHz EU) with 3km range.
USB interface (Charge and 2 Data channels)
Lithium polymer 3.7 rechargeable battery
Enclosure
Protective silicon cover (yellow)






                                        


Spend your time wisely!


 
How Does it Work?

A standard positioning device (phones, car...) receives the signal from the
American global positioning system (GPS) constellation. The signals are treated
by an algorithm with support of an installed map, computing a position solution
with accuracy of meters. Adding some other correction technics and reception of
signals from other global satellites systems as GLONASS (Russia), GALILEO
(Europe) or Beidou (China), the accuracy cannot be better than 1m in best
cases.





The RTK methods use the reception of two near devices, one is moving
(ROVER) and another remains static with a known position (BASE). The fact of
knowing the position is key to estimate the error due to the atmospheric
effects that disturb the electromagnetic path down from satellite to receiver.
This estimated error from the BASE will be used in the ROVER (who share the
same atmospheric error since both are close) to remove the errors and increase
the accuracy in 100 times.

It is easy to observe that at some point, both groups of signals will have
to be ""cooked"" together, requiring one of them is transported via
UHF, WIFI, GPRS or other communication system.


The RTKWare
module UBR1 is a multi-constellation receiver with integrated antenna and a UHF
modem. It can work as a ROVER or BASE, by simply switching a selector. The GNSS
signals can be received from satellites and sent transparently to the process
point in order you can have both signals in a USB port to feed your RTK software in
a laptop or on-board processor (via TTL port).
The hardware architecture is 100% open., having USB full access to all the configuration parameters of the used chips: modem and GPS receiver. Change and play with different receiver GNSS strings, modes, change protocols (NMEA/BINR/RTCM)... and send  the data via radio afterwards!.  It is fully compatible with RTKLIB, the popular open source RTK software.

The UBR1 is a powerful evaluation GNSS board

 








... and RTK for all


The UBR1 and UD1 are the result of two years of passionate electronic work with the objective of bringing the RTK to experimenters and developers that want to focus in applications and cannot expend thousand of dollars. This campaign can be the key for a big change in the application development world, but we can´t do it on our own. The high precision app ideas can become real... imagine: survey, parking, drones, autoguidance, sports.... A big amount of applications born worldwide from makers and experimenters without limits. 
Budget and Timeline
RTKWARE products are the result of two years of unpaid and altruistic work. A personal effort in which the expenses in prototyping, software, and instrumental equipment have been assumed to create three versions of the UBR1 and UD1: v0.1, v0.2 and v0.3 (3pcs each), achieving stability with the latest v0.3. The devices UBR1 and UD1 have been tested in real conditions, as you can see in the videos.In order to achieve a competitive final price, we need to launch a medium series production of at least 150 units. The amount you join is distributed as follows:





Looking at the figure, the benefits (green) will go entirely to create the stock of product and set up the online shop at www.rtkware.com after the crowdfunding campaign ends. If the campaign is not successfully completed, your contributions will be refunded.

the floor?  Or heard a spilling sound and
investigated only to find the toilet overflowing?  Well, millions of us have experienced just
that horror.  Some people catch the overflow quickly while others experience catastrophic damage to their home or commercial building.<br/></p>
<p>NoMoFlow Technology has developed a simple to
install valve that will limit the volume of water from overflows of 
toilets and other appliances with the intention to prevent the
disaster that so many of us have experienced. 
There are 350 million toilets in the US that need this valve.  It can also be used on millions of 
dishwashers,
water coolers, coffee machines, and other
appliances connected to a water supply in the US. - or anywhere in the 
world.   No home or building should be without this amazing device!</p><blockquote><p><i>""I wish I had this valve installed two years ago when my toilet overflowed.  The fans were drying out the house for a month while I lived with my dog and cat in the upstairs living room.  Then it was construction for 6 weeks.  Arrrggggggg..  Sure - the insurance company paid for almost all of the loss, but no way they could make up for the inconvenience.  And my fear... every time I leave the house, not knowing what I will find when I return home.""  </i>Chris, Redondo Beach, CA<br/></p></blockquote><p>The NoMoFlow valve works as a secondary controlling valve.  If the water
 flow is stopped by the primary control valve, as it would in a normal 
toilet flush for example, the valve resets
and waits for the next usage.  If the water flow exceeds the set volume 
that would represent an abnormal flow, it activates and stops the water 
flow.  It's that simple!</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1273871/files/20150306094325-Valve_with_labels.jpg?1425663805"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1326041/files/20150325140319-Prototype_2_with_labels.pxm_for_Indie.jpg?1427317399"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>Water is one of
the most destructive forces on the planet.  It created the Grand Canyon
and even geological relics we can see on Mars!  It is also the last commodity in our home
that is not protected with a shut off valve.  We protect our homes with
circuit breakers to protect against electrical shock.  Our electric
outlets are required to have GFCI and AFCI shut-off protection.   All electrical appliances come equipped with fuses that stop the flow of electricity in the event of a failure.  Natural gas pipes have emergency shut-off valves and earthquake detection
shut-off valves.  Isn’t it
time we installed a valve to stop excess water flow?  NoMoFlow<span> Technology has stepped up to the plate and has delivered such an

as long as we’ve been here.  I caught it
by the sound and before more than several gallons had flooded the floor.  Several dozen towels and a bucket and it was
all cleaned up.  I was lucky.  The two or three gallons were not enough to
cause any damage to the flooring or walls.

Submit the story of your disaster from water damage.  The top summaries published on the campaign will receive free NoMoFlow valves.  Please send text in email to NoMoFlow_Technology@icloud.com.  Photos are welcome.<br/></div>","NoMoFlow Technology  - SummaryA toilet overflow is like a hard drive crash - you've either had one or will have one.  Are you prepared for it?Ever walk into your bathroom and find 2 inches of water on
the floor?  Or heard a spilling sound and
investigated only to find the toilet overflowing?  Well, millions of us have experienced just
that horror.  Some people catch the overflow quickly while others experience catastrophic damage to their home or commercial building.
NoMoFlow Technology has developed a simple to
install valve that will limit the volume of water from overflows of 
toilets and other appliances with the intention to prevent the
disaster that so many of us have experienced. 
There are 350 million toilets in the US that need this valve.  It can also be used on millions of 
dishwashers,
water coolers, coffee machines, and other
appliances connected to a water supply in the US. - or anywhere in the 
world.   No home or building should be without this amazing device!""I wish I had this valve installed two years ago when my toilet overflowed.  The fans were drying out the house for a month while I lived with my dog and cat in the upstairs living room.  Then it was construction for 6 weeks.  Arrrggggggg..  Sure - the insurance company paid for almost all of the loss, but no way they could make up for the inconvenience.  And my fear... every time I leave the house, not knowing what I will find when I return home.""  Chris, Redondo Beach, CAThe NoMoFlow valve works as a secondary controlling valve.  If the water
 flow is stopped by the primary control valve, as it would in a normal 
toilet flush for example, the valve resets
and waits for the next usage.  If the water flow exceeds the set volume 
that would represent an abnormal flow, it activates and stops the water 
flow.  It's that simple!Water is one of
the most destructive forces on the planet.  It created the Grand Canyon
and even geological relics we can see on Mars!  It is also the last commodity in our home
that is not protected with a shut off valve.  We protect our homes with
circuit breakers to protect against electrical shock.  Our electric
outlets are required to have GFCI and AFCI shut-off protection.   All electrical appliances come equipped with fuses that stop the flow of electricity in the event of a failure.  Natural gas pipes have emergency shut-off valves and earthquake detection
shut-off valves.  Isn’t it
time we installed a valve to stop excess water flow?  NoMoFlow Technology has stepped up to the plate and has delivered such an
item.""The plastic piece that connects the hose to the bottom of the toilet tank broke.  We did not discover it till the whole side of the house was flooded and the noise of a wall collapsing alerted us.  The water bill indicated almost  600 gallons in excess of normal for the period.  It took over 6 months to get the house back to a semblance of normal.  What I would have given for a 3 gallon spill.....""  Tom, Palos Verdes, CA

<p><b>The problem of crime</b> in St. Lucia is a national and personal one.  After losing six family members to homicide <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">we have committed ourselves to creating impactful, life-changing programs for youth and adults.  Each tragic time a cousin was beaten or stabbed to death, the anger, sadness and frustration grew.  These tragic and senseless killings caused tremendous pain and ignited the </span>fervor<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> to take a calculated stand against violence.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Limited extracurricular and job opportunities for young people have directly contributed to the crime rate on the island. The youth unemployment rate is over 40% and one-third of the prisoners are between the age of 16 and 25.  It is estimated that youth crime and violence in St. Lucia generates </span>approx.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> USD$3 million in lost benefits to society and approx. USD$7.7 million in lost benefits to private individuals annually.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">To address the </span>problem<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> of violence against women, ReddBoa trains women in the jiu jitsu tenants of
self-defense: Prevention, Rapid Response Defenses, and Ambush Response Defenses. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">ReddBoa also offers trainings in leadership skills, team building, conflict resolution, job readiness as well as opportunities in youth mentoring and volunteerism.  Our programs give the most disenfranchised youth the opportunity to channel their energies in more productive ways.  Youth develop new skills through educational workshops and the physical and mental practice of BJJ and yoga.  </span></p>
<p>ReddBoa operates from best practices in positive youth development and evidence-based programs, giving youth the platform to be heard and to lead.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Health and Wellness: </b>St. Lucia has the <b>highest rate of diabetes and the second highest rate of hypertension in the world, per capita, </b>as well as one of the highest rates of obesity in the Caribbean. Now is the time to introduce yoga and BJJ to help combat these negative health outcomes.   One of the contributors to poor health is diet.  St. Lucians would benefit from more organic food options.  ReddBoa provides organic gardening classes and workshops through our organic demonstration garden, promoting self-sufficiency, healthy eating, and education around sustainable farming practices.<br/></p>

<p>The health benefits of yoga have been studied widely and are numerous.  Yoga helps lower blood pressure, blood sugar and bad cholesterol while boosting good cholesterol.  Yoga has been found to lower blood sugar in several ways--by lowering blood sugar levels, patients decrease the risk of diabetic complications such as heart attack, kidney failure, and blindness. Likewise, the dynamic practice of Jiu Jitsu is associated with many benefits including weight loss, improved health and increased physical and mental fitness.  BJJ cultivates an appreciation and appetite for hard work and perseverance.   BJJ promotes the concept that a smaller weaker person can successfully defend against a bigger stronger assailant by using leverage and proper techniques. <br/></p>

Damian and Ratoya Adjodha, to pilot a youth and agriculture awareness day
called (Eat In Act Out).  The event took
place at COG in Anse-la Raye, as part of The Food Project’s international day outcry.  The intent of the day was to raise awareness
around sustainable agriculture and healthy food access.  A small group of 13 students, from various
secondary schools on the island, were invited to learn and participate in this
day of action.  The day comprised of
several educational activities which were centered around healthy eating habits
and organic farming methodologies.  Eat
In Act Out successfully engaged and inspired students to become more informed
about our global food system, the clear differences between conventional vs sustainable
organic agriculture and how those practices directly affect them as citizens of
Southern nations. <br/>
</div><div>
<p>Catalyst Organic Gardens also successfully held a two week intensive training
program called Sowing The Seeds of Change, where a cohort of youth were trained
in sustainable organic agricultural techniques including: seedling production,
crop planning, pest control, composting and weed management. The enthusiam and
overall sense of accomplishment can still be felt as many of the former youth
trainees still recall their days in training and some have gone on to become
farmers and community organizers. ReddBoa will continue to form alliances with local
community groups that are creating impact and changing lives.  </p>

ReddBoa Inc. is a holistic, social enterprise model that offers an amalgamation of programs in Brazilian jiu jitsu, yoga, sustainable agriculture, and educational
programming for all age groups.  These programs serve as a conduit for personal and social change by improving health and well-being and providing opportunities in youth and adult education and community
building. ReddBoa's programs facilitate contemplation, discussion, and action both on the mat and in the community.  Through the combination of the practices of both jiu jitsu and yoga, ReddBoa builds and strengthens communities by creating strong youth-adult partnerships, a healthier population, and a more compassionate and supportive culture.  


The founders and owners, John H Redd and Pertula George-Redd are a dynamic team combining John's 35 years of martial arts training and Pertula's twelve years’ experience managing youth development and sustainable agriculture programs. Born and raised in St. Lucia, Pertula has spent the last 16 years in the US gleaning best practices in non-profit management and social enterprise.  She holds an MA in Sustainable International Development, a BA in International Studies and is a certified vinyasa and prenatal yoga instructor.  In addition to his martial arts training, BS in Psychology and professional certifications, John is also a talented corporate trainer with over 18 years of experience in the field of learning and development and curriculum design.  Together, they will employ their skills, expertise, and passion, to implement holistic programs that will help combat the social and economic ills plaguing St. Lucia.  





The Issues We're Seeking to Impact


The problem of crime in St. Lucia is a national and personal one.  After losing six family members to homicide we have committed ourselves to creating impactful, life-changing programs for youth and adults.  Each tragic time a cousin was beaten or stabbed to death, the anger, sadness and frustration grew.  These tragic and senseless killings caused tremendous pain and ignited the fervor to take a calculated stand against violence.  
Limited extracurricular and job opportunities for young people have directly contributed to the crime rate on the island. The youth unemployment rate is over 40% and one-third of the prisoners are between the age of 16 and 25.  It is estimated that youth crime and violence in St. Lucia generates approx. USD$3 million in lost benefits to society and approx. USD$7.7 million in lost benefits to private individuals annually.  
To address the problem of violence against women, ReddBoa trains women in the jiu jitsu tenants of
self-defense: Prevention, Rapid Response Defenses, and Ambush Response Defenses. 
ReddBoa also offers trainings in leadership skills, team building, conflict resolution, job readiness as well as opportunities in youth mentoring and volunteerism.  Our programs give the most disenfranchised youth the opportunity to channel their energies in more productive ways.  Youth develop new skills through educational workshops and the physical and mental practice of BJJ and yoga.  
ReddBoa operates from best practices in positive youth development and evidence-based programs, giving youth the platform to be heard and to lead.

Health and Wellness: St. Lucia has the highest rate of diabetes and the second highest rate of hypertension in the world, per capita, as well as one of the highest rates of obesity in the Caribbean. Now is the time to introduce yoga and BJJ to help combat these negative health outcomes.   One of the contributors to poor health is diet.  St. Lucians would benefit from more organic food options.  ReddBoa provides organic gardening classes and workshops through our organic demonstration garden, promoting self-sufficiency, healthy eating, and education around sustainable farming practices.



The health benefits of yoga have been studied widely and are numerous.  Yoga helps lower blood pressure, blood sugar and bad cholesterol while boosting good cholesterol.  Yoga has been found to lower blood sugar in several ways--by lowering blood sugar levels, patients decrease the risk of diabetic complications such as heart attack, kidney failure, and blindness. Likewise, the dynamic practice of Jiu Jitsu is associated with many benefits including weight loss, improved health and increased physical and mental fitness.  BJJ cultivates an appreciation and appetite for hard work and perseverance.   BJJ promotes the concept that a smaller weaker person can successfully defend against a bigger stronger assailant by using leverage and proper techniques.

Our Impact

Through your support, ReddBoa
is poised to introduce a unique mix of fitness, enrichment, leadership, and advocacy training to the most underserved populations. Our social enterprise model allows us to reinvest our earnings back into the community by directly serving seniors and disenfranchised youth therefore making our programs accessible and available to all demographics. Your contributions will allow us to reach the most underserved youth and adults in St. Lucia.  

ReddBoa provides students with tools for a life-long practice of personal and community empowerment through educational workshops--covering topics of leadership, management, team building, interpersonal skills, presentation skills, public speaking, job readiness and more--community building activities such as developing community gardens and cultivating environmental stewardship through volunteer programs--and the physical and mental training of martial arts, yoga, and gardening, calming the mind, strengthening the body, and inspiring creativity. In an era where fast food and sedentary lifestyles are a threat to our well-being, learning how to stay disciplined and healthy is a martial art.  

As the former Executive Director of a fledgling non-profit organization, Pertula brought people of all backgrounds together to advance a common cause.  During her tenure as ED, Prince Charles of Whales who is an avid organic farmer, the former US Surgeon General Dr. Regina Benjamin, and other dignitaries visited the half-acre farm to learn more about the organization's mission and applauded Pertula for her work and accomplishments in the community.  In 2013, President Obama thanked Pertula for her contributions in his speech at her naturalization ceremony at the White House (minute 4:35). 
John holds a purple belt in BJJ and trains under the Royce Gracie lineage.  In his professional life, he has  won several employee performance awards for his dynamic facilitation and leadership skills.  Some of his accolades include facilitator of the year as well as multiple employee achievement awards.                                                       
 Anse-la-Raye Primary School “Sowing Seeds of Change”  youth trainees   In 2005, Pertula partnered with Catalyst Organic Garden (COG) owners,
Damian and Ratoya Adjodha, to pilot a youth and agriculture awareness day
called (Eat In Act Out).  The event took
place at COG in Anse-la Raye, as part of The Food Project’s international day outcry.  The intent of the day was to raise awareness
around sustainable agriculture and healthy food access.  A small group of 13 students, from various
secondary schools on the island, were invited to learn and participate in this
day of action.  The day comprised of
several educational activities which were centered around healthy eating habits
and organic farming methodologies.  Eat
In Act Out successfully engaged and inspired students to become more informed
about our global food system, the clear differences between conventional vs sustainable
organic agriculture and how those practices directly affect them as citizens of
Southern nations. 

Catalyst Organic Gardens also successfully held a two week intensive training
program called Sowing The Seeds of Change, where a cohort of youth were trained
in sustainable organic agricultural techniques including: seedling production,
crop planning, pest control, composting and weed management. The enthusiam and
overall sense of accomplishment can still be felt as many of the former youth
trainees still recall their days in training and some have gone on to become
farmers and community organizers. ReddBoa will continue to form alliances with local
community groups that are creating impact and changing lives.

Risks & Challenges

Lack of awareness of the benefits of BJJ and yoga: ReddBoa would be the first BJJ school on the island. Therefore, we plan on launching extensive marketing and educational campaigns to raise awareness of the benefits of BJJ and self-defense.  Likewise, yoga is fairly new on the island--there is only one official yoga studio.  Because of the cost and lack of understanding of yoga, the practice is only accessible to a small group of people. We will employ our motivational skills to recruit and retain students of all ages and backgrounds.  
As the premiere multi-discipline training center in St. Lucia, we will provide multiple opportunities and programs to keep people of all backgrounds and ages excited and engaged.  Our affiliation with Capital MMA and collaboration with Radiance Yoga, in Virginia, will bring diversity to the mat through student and instructor exchanges.  As part of our international guest instructor program we will host instructors from all over the world throughout the year.  Finally, we will have a diverse revenue stream to ensure that the social programs are supported financially.  Through our social enterprise model we will reinvest our profits in programs that benefit the community.  The following funding streams will help sustain the youth and community programs:
-Membership dues
-Workshop and seminar fees
-Tournaments
-Local, regional, and international retreats
-Grants
-Events and fundraisers
-Event hosting for outside groups (rental income)
Between 1965 and 2000, St. Lucia lost 71% of its tertiary educated workforce to developed countries (mainly the US). Pertula is one of the few in the 71% who will move back to St. Lucia.  Her decision is driven by her personal and professional commitment and passion to developing and implementing the most impactful youth and community programs to serve disenfranchised youth.  ReddBoa's Long Term Goal is to equip its graduates to manage and staff expansion sites in towns and villages across the country.

<p>My interest
for oxygen-enriched drinks woke up as far back as in the beginning of the
2000-th. A long period of time I made my experiments mixing liquids with
oxygen. As a result, I invented a mixer for oxygen cocktails to be used
everywhere: in bars, restaurants, sports complexes, outdoors and even at home.</p>
<p>Three years ago, I had
to stop my work at the project because of shortage of money but now I have an
opportunity to finish it and start a serial production of my oxygen mixer to
sell it worldwide.</p>
<p>My wish is
that as many as possible people could drink oxygen drinks. While working on my
invention I noticed that many Americans took interest in it. Owing to the great
popularity of “Oxygen Bars”, I am sure, oxygen cocktails would take a worthy
place in the market.</p>

life in <span>big cities is so intense that it gives fewer
and fewer chances to feel healthy and to stay healthy as long as possible. We
can make a long list of what we need to be healthy. And perhaps the first item
will be oxygen. The precious source of priceless life is disappearing from big
cities and leaving their inhabitants melancholic, exhausted and depressed. <br/></span></p><p><span>
</span></p><p>The Oxygen cocktail enables the cities’ prisoners to take a refreshing portion of oxygen. </p>
<p>The Oxygen cocktail is about a thick delicious foam made of any sort of liquid basis
(juice, milk, syrups) and thousands of fleeting but incredibly helpful and healthy
molecules of oxygen. Tireless armies of tiny “oxygen workers” help the body to quickly
and effectively get rid of the negative consequences of oxygen starvation and get
the energy, the vitality and the good mood. One portion of an Oxygen cocktail can be a good equivalent of some hours’ of
walk in the forest.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>As the
oxygen foam gets to the digestive tract, it starts its work and is sucked into
the blood and lymph trying to pay attention to all the cells, detoxifying and
deleting all the substances which the body doesn’t need any more. The foam improves
the metabolism and the blood supply of the cells and brings the reflex actions
into balance.</p>
<p>The Oxygen cocktail is everyone’s need. The life-bringing molecules
are ready to give oxygen to everyone who needs it. And for little children,
expectant mother and elderly people the oxygen cocktail is a must.</p>
<p>Children
will especially like this foamy drink. The Oxygen cocktail will increase their energy which is essential
for adequate growth, development and the immune system. This is especially
important for those children who get frequently ill.       </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445427914/kofgleudg4pbadvhwzbp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Sportsmen
and fitness freaks have a great necessity of the oxygen. Intensive muscles contraction
demands high levels of oxygen. Additional portions of oxygen will optimize
sports performance and lead to the soonest possible strength recovery after
such efforts.

<p>The Oxygen cocktail is a true friend helping you to lose
weight and stay slim. The low value of fat in the drink reduces hunger because
the light foam fills almost the entire stomach leaving no place for something
sweet and excessive foodstuffs. Besides, the Oxygen cocktail activates the work of the liver cells and
reduces fat. You’ll lose excess weight without any effort because your
metabolism will be in perfect balance.</p>
<p>The Oxygen cocktail will also help those who can’t stop smoking. This drink cleans out the
lungs.</p>
<p>The Oxygen cocktail is of great importance for expectant mothers. Pregnancy causes
the volume of blood to increase. That’s why women need more oxygen to nourish the
blood. Oxygen starvation that expectant mothers suffer from leads to the fetal
hypoxia. That’s why the Oxygen cocktail will help women get rid of
unpleasant effects of oxygen starvation. </p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445425574/vlcgy0rug7tof6wawicu.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 406.01px; height: 404px;""/><br/><br/><p>It’s
silly to think that intellectual work doesn’t hurt your health. Medical
specialists call chronic fatigue syndrome the disease of the 21<sup>st</sup>
century. Time doesn’t stop, it moves faster making life incredibly intense. In
this situation sleep disorders and overfatigue is something we can’t afford.
The Oxygen cocktail allows
you to forget what headache, apathy, fatigue and irritation is. You will be
able to work in the tempo that fits you best without worrying if your body is
able to bear it.</p>
<p>The vital
cocktail takes care of those who have heart diseases and cardiovascular,
respiratory, nervous and digestive disorders. Such disorders have a negative
effect on the supply of the body with energy. The Oxygen cocktail will allow you to get rid of these
disorders.</p>
<p>Health
problems one had being young and many years of work affect elderly people. And
they often suffer from a lot of diseases, mainly from chronic oxygen starvation
or so-called hypoxia. The brain and the heart muscle of elderly people are most
sensible for the lack of oxygen. 7-8 minutes with no oxygen circulation in the
blood are enough to make irreversible changes in the brain and it will be
practically impossible to bring the body back to life. The Oxygen cocktail gives
you the feeling of enlightenment or to be more exact the feeling of lightness
and weightlessness. This is nothing else but the improvement of the brain
functions. The Oxygen cocktail is a must
if you have problems with bronchopulmonary, cardiovascular and respiratory
systems and chronic diseases and fatigue. </p>

</p><p><b>How does the </b><b>Oxygen cocktail </b><b>work?</b></p>
<p>The Oxygen cocktail has a three-stage effect on the body:</p>
<p><b>Stage 1 “Sucking”</b></p>
<p>After the foam is
delivered through the mouth and into the stomach and partly into the gut, the oxygen
together with the fito elements and vitamins is sucked into the blood and
circulates there in the dissolved form. This makes oxygen move quicker and more
easily fill parts of the body and the tissues. </p>
<p><b>Stage 2 “How oxygen works”</b></p>
<p>The energy of oxygen
is transformed into the energy of the biological processes, stimulates the
microcirculation and the permeability of the cell’s membrane, stimulates the redox
strengthening the energy sources of the body, widens its abilities and
stimulates its immune system. In addition, the oxygenation of the body
stimulates the metabolism in cells, harmonizes the metabolism and the reflex
processes into harmony, activates the blood circulation, regulates the
nutrition and the renewing of the tissues.</p>
<p><b>Stage 3 “How the fito-vitamin complex works”</b></p>
<p>Since the metabolism
is activated, the digestion of vitamins and herbal substances of the cocktail
is improved. That’s why their effect is strengthened (and can be even doubled).</p>
<p>In other words, the
oxygen cocktail starts a chain reaction. And, as a result, the body turns from a dysfunctioning into a healthy one. Our

</h2></div>","Mixer for producing Oxygen cocktails with direct introduction of oxygen at the liquid-mixing time
My interest
for oxygen-enriched drinks woke up as far back as in the beginning of the
2000-th. A long period of time I made my experiments mixing liquids with
oxygen. As a result, I invented a mixer for oxygen cocktails to be used
everywhere: in bars, restaurants, sports complexes, outdoors and even at home.
Three years ago, I had
to stop my work at the project because of shortage of money but now I have an
opportunity to finish it and start a serial production of my oxygen mixer to
sell it worldwide.
My wish is
that as many as possible people could drink oxygen drinks. While working on my
invention I noticed that many Americans took interest in it. Owing to the great
popularity of “Oxygen Bars”, I am sure, oxygen cocktails would take a worthy
place in the market.
We present a model of the oxygen mixer produced in form of the first
artificial Earth satellite. 

This model is very steady and looks up to date.  


The
mixer model may be produced in different colors.                                                                                    

OXYGEN COCKTAIL
 Today the tempo of
life in big cities is so intense that it gives fewer
and fewer chances to feel healthy and to stay healthy as long as possible. We
can make a long list of what we need to be healthy. And perhaps the first item
will be oxygen. The precious source of priceless life is disappearing from big
cities and leaving their inhabitants melancholic, exhausted and depressed. 
The Oxygen cocktail enables the cities’ prisoners to take a refreshing portion of oxygen. 
The Oxygen cocktail is about a thick delicious foam made of any sort of liquid basis
(juice, milk, syrups) and thousands of fleeting but incredibly helpful and healthy
molecules of oxygen. Tireless armies of tiny “oxygen workers” help the body to quickly
and effectively get rid of the negative consequences of oxygen starvation and get
the energy, the vitality and the good mood. One portion of an Oxygen cocktail can be a good equivalent of some hours’ of
walk in the forest.


As the
oxygen foam gets to the digestive tract, it starts its work and is sucked into
the blood and lymph trying to pay attention to all the cells, detoxifying and
deleting all the substances which the body doesn’t need any more. The foam improves
the metabolism and the blood supply of the cells and brings the reflex actions
into balance.
The Oxygen cocktail is everyone’s need. The life-bringing molecules
are ready to give oxygen to everyone who needs it. And for little children,
expectant mother and elderly people the oxygen cocktail is a must.
Children
will especially like this foamy drink. The Oxygen cocktail will increase their energy which is essential
for adequate growth, development and the immune system. This is especially
important for those children who get frequently ill.       
Sportsmen
and fitness freaks have a great necessity of the oxygen. Intensive muscles contraction
demands high levels of oxygen. Additional portions of oxygen will optimize
sports performance and lead to the soonest possible strength recovery after
such efforts.

The Oxygen cocktail is a true friend helping you to lose
weight and stay slim. The low value of fat in the drink reduces hunger because
the light foam fills almost the entire stomach leaving no place for something
sweet and excessive foodstuffs. Besides, the Oxygen cocktail activates the work of the liver cells and
reduces fat. You’ll lose excess weight without any effort because your
metabolism will be in perfect balance.
The Oxygen cocktail will also help those who can’t stop smoking. This drink cleans out the
lungs.
The Oxygen cocktail is of great importance for expectant mothers. Pregnancy causes
the volume of blood to increase. That’s why women need more oxygen to nourish the
blood. Oxygen starvation that expectant mothers suffer from leads to the fetal
hypoxia. That’s why the Oxygen cocktail will help women get rid of
unpleasant effects of oxygen starvation.  It’s
silly to think that intellectual work doesn’t hurt your health. Medical
specialists call chronic fatigue syndrome the disease of the 21st
century. Time doesn’t stop, it moves faster making life incredibly intense. In
this situation sleep disorders and overfatigue is something we can’t afford.
The Oxygen cocktail allows
you to forget what headache, apathy, fatigue and irritation is. You will be
able to work in the tempo that fits you best without worrying if your body is
able to bear it.
The vital
cocktail takes care of those who have heart diseases and cardiovascular,
respiratory, nervous and digestive disorders. Such disorders have a negative
effect on the supply of the body with energy. The Oxygen cocktail will allow you to get rid of these
disorders.
Health
problems one had being young and many years of work affect elderly people. And
they often suffer from a lot of diseases, mainly from chronic oxygen starvation
or so-called hypoxia. The brain and the heart muscle of elderly people are most
sensible for the lack of oxygen. 7-8 minutes with no oxygen circulation in the
blood are enough to make irreversible changes in the brain and it will be
practically impossible to bring the body back to life. The Oxygen cocktail gives
you the feeling of enlightenment or to be more exact the feeling of lightness
and weightlessness. This is nothing else but the improvement of the brain
functions. The Oxygen cocktail is a must
if you have problems with bronchopulmonary, cardiovascular and respiratory
systems and chronic diseases and fatigue. 

Specialists
recommend taking courses of Oxygen cocktail therapy (7-10 cocktails per course – 1-2 portions a
day). You  will get the best healing and
beneficial effect if you eat it slowly with a spoon or drink it with a straw within
5-10 minutes after it was made.
Fans of
diets and fasting will naturally appreciate a diet called “oxygen slim”. You’ll
only need to take 5 portions of cocktail on the daily basis instead of meals.
Two days of this diet will clean your bowels and make room for useful bacteria
and microorganisms. 
Sportsmen
and fitness freaks can drink this cocktail before their training sessions (this
will significantly boost their performance) as well as after the sessions (to
build up one’s strength). 
The Oxygen cocktail industry pays back your investments very
quickly. You make money out of thin air in the direct and the indirect meaning
of this phrase!
The Oxygen cocktail can be made even at home. And you don’t
need to spend much time and effort to do this.
         HOW TO MAKE OXYGEN COCKTAIL WITH        
                        AN OXYGEN MIXER
The Oxygen cocktail is a product used for diets and therapeutic nutrition. It’s not a medication.
The Oxygen cocktail consists only of natural ingredients which meet the top quality
standards.
To make an Oxygen cocktail :
It’s necessary to fill the liquid (juice, water, milk, fruit drink) with oxygen. For this you’ll need a source of oxygen such as an oxygen cylinder or a device, producing oxygen such as an oxygen concentrator.
Mix the liquid with oxygen till you get a steady foam. This can be done with the help of an Oxygen Mixer
As the base of the drink you can use juice, milk or any unaerated drink. You can add alcohol drinks as well. We don’t recommend using nectars. The most foamy juices are apple, cherry, grape juices and fruit drinks. You’d better use cold drinks. Warm liquid breaks up the oxygen and stops the fine foam from building up. 

The last element of the Oxygen cocktail is the foam-forming ingredient. You’ll need to solve 2 grams of such substance in 100 ml of juice and you’ll get 300-400 grams of the oxygen foam.



 Take a 350-400 ml container
and put 2 grams of the foam-forming ingredient inside.

Add 100 ml of cold
juice or other liquid.

Link the mixer to the
source of oxygen (oxygen concentrator). You shouldn’t add
water to the humidifier of the concentrator!

Put the Oxygen Mixer
in the off mode into the container with the drink for 3-5 seconds to fill the
liquid with oxygen.

Turn on the mixer for
10-15 seconds to make the foamy drink.

Then turn off the
mixer and the Oxygen cocktail is ready.

In bars and
clubs Oxygen cocktail with alcohol are very popular. The most tasty cocktail
is the one made on the base of aromatic wine. And those who take care of their health
would be pleased to find out that oxygen reduces the harmful effect of the
alcohol.
The foam we get while

Together, the yogi couple believes in practicing mindfulness and sustainability for our planet through yoga and plant-based, Ayurveda inspired foods. They are excited to celebrate this life with you.
This campaign helps Amir and Adrienne open a space that will serve as an everyday celebration to showcase their offerings and inspire movement through yoga, meditation, healing, plant-based eats, and soul-vibin’ music for their conscious community of athletes, yogis, and everyone in between looking to lead a more balanced way of life.
Contributors will help the couple to achieve their vision to make healthy, organic, plant-based foods, yoga, and Ayurvedic medicine accessible to all in a safe and sacred space.

What We Need & What You Get
Funding needed to bring this wellness event space and studio to life is approximately $95,000, which will go towards the studio's monthly rent, personnel (full-time and part-time staff), marketing, admin, insurance, and production of events.
We will be the first studio to fuse Ayurvedic medicine and workshop-based Ayurvedic education with yoga and plant-based food!
If we do not reach our entire goal, funds raised will go towards hosting quarterly Eat Move Meditate inspired events.

The Impact
Aside from the boom in the tech industry that tends to pull us away from our true selves, and the increase in gentrification that is reshaping our once familiar neighborhoods, we still have the power to gather as a community, build, grow, and rise together. This is our dream, to make yoga, meditation, and (really delicious) plant-based food accessible to communities that need it most. This wellness space is not only a studio, it is a way of life.
YogiAthlete and Ho'ola Mamma have successfully co-hosted wellness events together since December 2016. Their most recent event, 'Eat Move Meditate' welcomed a community of 200 attendees ranging in all ages, sizes, ethnicity, and experience, and featured brands such as Just Water, Southern Fried Vegan, Simply Wholesome, and Sun & Swell Foods.

<h2>Gaming, leveled up.</h2>
<p>Hello!  We want to fundamentally improve gaming by offering a safe alternative to energy drinks that still supercharges your gaming.  The way we do it is by blending five brain-boosting ingredients (without caffeine!) called ""nootropics"" into a capsule you can take before you game!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What are Nootropics?</h2>
<p>Nootropics are a wide range of cognition-boosting compounds that can benefit your brain. In our case, we have created a nootropic blend targeted specifically to improve the mental performance of gamers. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508628192/o3aiosrpwuc9qqoevbov.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>How Athena Nootropics was born</h2>
<p>Athena Nootropics was born out of a love of games and gamers.</p>
<p>When I owned a 24/7/365 PC Gaming Room, lots of my customers brought energy drinks from home or bought them from me.  The prices varied from $2.50 on the low end up to $5+ for a single large energy drink.  I noticed that my customers often drank two or even three energy drinks depending on how long they visited for and what time of day they visited.</p>
<p>I thought, ""There has to be a cheaper, better, safer alternative.""</p>
<p>What my search sparked in me was a realization that I could take advantage of cutting-edge scientific research to identify substances linked to cognitive enhancement.  Even better, I could tailor a blend specifically towards the needs of gamers everywhere.</p>
<p>After spending hundreds of hours reading experience reports and a couple years trying a (frankly absurd) number of different nootropics I was convinced that I was on the right path.  Aided by a good friend with a degree in medical biochemistry, we settled on five awesome ingredients for our gaming stack which we called: Athena's Blessing.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2>How Athena's Blessing works</h2>
<p>Athena's Blessing targets the parts of the brain that are critical to playing your best game. Alpha-GPC and ALCAR boost your energy, L-Theanine, and NALT settle you into a flow state, and Bacopa Monnieri supercharges your memory!</p>

<h2>What We Need</h2>
<p>We need $35,000 to manufacture 1,500 bottles and build the foundation for a business that will put gamers first.</p>
<h3>Production: $25,000 - $30,000</h3>
<p>We reached out to manufacturers and got fairly consistent responses - order sizes are a minimum of 1,500 bottles, then scale up to 2,500 and 5,000. </p>
<p>1,500 - 2,500 bottles of Athena's Blessing will cost between $25,000 and $30,000 to produce, not including shipping costs.</p>
<p>This also includes 3rd Party testing and compliance review.</p>
<h3>Business Costs: $7,000</h3>
<p>This is where we go from rushing your base to focusing on our own economy! By economy we mean:</p>
<p>- Improving our website and eCommerce experience with professional help. (Ballpark $2,000)</p>
<p>- Renting a small office/co-working-space to work full time on Athena Nootropics. (Ballpark $2,000)</p>
<p>- Renting space in a warehouse from which we can ship our goodies (Ballpark $3,000 for 4 months)</p>
<h3>Marketing Costs: $17,000 - ????</h3>
<p>- Produce, package and distribute samples (Stretch-goal here, ballpark $15,000)</p>
<p>- Partnering up with LAN Centers and eSports competitions to sponsor events. (Based on samples, but ballpark $2,000 in additional costs)</p>
<p>- And eventually investing in medical studies/human trials to drill down into what else we can do to improve your gaming experience.  ($$$? The great unknown!)</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What You Get</h2>
<h3>XxPerk60noscopexX: All your perk are belong to us.</h3>
<p>We're going to go all-out sourcing top quality ingredients in order to sell Athena's Blessing to you at a cost of around 1$ per day.  If you take a chance on us, you won't regret it!</p>
<p>In case that is not enough on its own, let's talk perks!</p>
<p>Athena's blessing is a medium to long-term investment in your own gaming abilities.  If you already drink coffee or energy drinks, then you may as well double down and enjoy the long-term benefits of Athena's Blessing!</p>
<p><strong>Marble Inscription:</strong>  We intend to buy a massive slab of marble and then inscribe the names of all of our backers on it so that we can display it at our future offices.</p>
<p><strong>Lifetime Discount:</strong>  It only seems appropriate that we reward you for backing us early by having your back for life.  So, for anyone backing us at the Soldier of Fortune level or above, we will be offering you a lifetime 10% off Athena's Blessing discount.</p>
<p><strong>Bottles of Athena's Blessing:</strong> Each bottle comes with a one month supply of Athena's Blessing, enough to help you get the most out of your gaming.  No more losing your cool, much more in the zone flow.</p>

<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>Call us crazy, but we think a safe, effective alternative to energy drinks should be affordable at a cost of around 1$ per serving.</p>
<h3>An affordable alternative to energy drinks that makes cents!</h3>
<p>By making performance enhanced gaming simple, safe and affordable, not to mention tolerance-free, we can offer a novel alternative to caffeinated beverages.  At the same time, Athena's Blessing is designed to work synergistically with caffeinated beverages so that you don't have to choose between the two. </p>
<p>Instead, you can cut your costs drastically - if you eliminate a single energy drink per day in favor of Athena's Blessing, you would save a minimum of $30 a month, (assuming your beverage costs $2/serving).</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>We believe that honesty is our most important currency, and thus we intend to be as transparent as possible with the risks currently facing us. </p>
<p><strong>What keeps Brendan up at night?</strong></p>
<p>- Inventory-based business problems:  Producing more product than is being sold (sitting on unsold product).</p>
<p> - Introductions to new markets beyond USA/CAN:  We would love to bring Athena's Blessing to people across the world, but we need to look before we leap, and make sure we are taking the best care of our current customers.</p>
<p>- Being poached/copied by a large supplement company who will undercut us:  The fact remains that by being entirely transparent, there is really nothing stopping one of the big players in the supplement industry from copying us.  We need your help and loyalty to win as the underdog!</p>
<p>- Finding an effective storage/work area in order to maximize effective shipping practices:  ""I learned things I never knew I never knew,"" in this case, I am referring to centralized warehousing and shipping so that we can get our products to you on schedule.</p>
<p>- Developing e-commerce/web sales, packing/shipping infrastructure, expanding marketing/sponsorship opportunities, and other late-game business practices: We like Nootropics, but our first duty is to educate people before we try to sell them our products.  </p>
<p><strong>What keeps Devan up at night?</strong></p>
<p>- Acquiring a substandard ingredient that affects an entire batch of product, meaning delays as we source pure ingredients: We will be getting 3rd party testing done of all our ingredients, and on the off-chance one has problems we will have a backup ready to go.  Even with a backup ready to rumble, we will still need to have it tested, which could throw our timeline out of whack!</p>
<p>- Dealing with differences in health agencies in various regions and the differences in their labeling: Did you know names of products could be considered labeling claims?  Neither did we until a couple of months ago, and that's just here in the US of A!  We intend to tread very lightly in regards to compliance with all relevant authorities in order to minimize delays and maximize transparency.</p>
<p>- Variable shipping costs overseas:  As a Canadian, I know customs can delay deliveries, and we expect to learn the hard way that delivery time-frames for different countries will be less consistent that our customers may like.</p>
<p>- Production delays which affect the timing of monthly deliveries for subscription members. Since we will be contracting out our manufacturing (but still testing everything along the way), we have to accept that some things will be outside of our control.  We promise to do our best to overcome any obstacles we face, and will switch manufacturers if our customer's experience is being negatively impacted.</p>
<p><strong>What keeps MoonJi up at night?</strong></p>
<p>- Making sure the website/logo/label/Indiegogo art is cute, informative and on theme:  Building a brand as the only artist on the team is exhausting!</p>
<p>- Integrating sustainable business practices to lower our environmental footprint: No amount of enhancement is worth damaging the planet that we all share, and we are committed to doing everything in our power to be good stewards of our beautiful world.</p>
<p>- Lack of engagement on social media: This is a learning process for us, and we will be relying on feedback both positive and negative from our awesome customers to guide us.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>- Share the unique idea that is Athena’s Blessing with others who might be interested in trying Nootropics!  Seriously, this is the single most awesome thing you can do, and we love you for it.</p>
<p>- Connect us with business professionals in the aforementioned areas of risk!  We love advice, and as a startup, we can use as much as we can get!</p>
<p>- Bring awareness to streamers/pro teams interested in partnership opportunities. We strongly believe in our product, and if someone you know has an audience, we would love to get some Athena's Blessing into their hands!</p>
<p>- Educate yourself on what Nootropics are and how they may be beneficial to your daily routine, even if you have determined Athena’s Blessing is not for you!  Our whole goal is to help people game better, but the bigger picture is to help people find out what works best for them!</p>
<p>- Try using Athena’s Blessing for other mentally draining-tasks, even if you are not a gamer.  Let's be honest, the original Athena was a whole lot more into war and heroes and tasks than she was into gaming.</p>
<p>- Provide effective feedback on how to improve our product/appeal to a wider audience via our website.  We want to make and sell the best possible cognitive enhancement product for gamers.  As our customers, you are uniquely qualified to tell us how to do a better job, and we would seriously love to hear your feedback.</p>
<p>- Engage with us on social media to stay updated on news and promos.  That way we can reward you for being awesome!</p>
<p>- Getting in touch with media outlets to talk about the product. More coverage for us means more people that might benefit from Athena's Blessing actually finding out about it!</p>
</div><p> </p><h2>FAQ</h2><p><u>Why are you crowdsourcing it?</u></p><p>We are crowdsourcing our Nootropic because we love the platform, and it gives us the ability to reach lots of interested people quickly.  If everyone is as excited about Nootropics for gamers as we are, then this is the perfect way to hit the ground running, and get our product into people’s hands as fast as possible.</p><p><u>Why do you publish the ingredients and dosage in your stack?</u></p><p>We believe in transparency, and a big part of that is knowing exactly what and how much of any ingredient is in our product.  We trust that by always being upfront with our customers we can preemptively answer questions or concerns they might have.</p><p><u>Is it safe?</u></p><p>Yes, Athena’s Blessing contains 4 ingredients that are GRAS (Generally Regarded As Safe) as well as one that has been used in Ayurvedic medicine since the 6th century and is very well tolerated when taken in the amount in our capsules (Bacopa Monnieri).  Athena's Blessing is produced in an FDA certified GMP (Good Manufacturing Processes) facility and our individual ingredients are tested for purity and the exclusion of heavy metals.  We also 3rd party test our ingredients before production as well as 3rd party test our finished products.</p><p><u>How many days in a row can I take it?</u></p><p>We suggest cycling off Athena’s blessing when not engaged in strenuous mental activity to make sure you get the most out of it. We don’t suggest any specific schedule as everybody is different and supplements work differently for different people.</p><p><u>What are the long-term effects?</u></p><p>A sweet K/D ratio and an improved memory!</p><p><u>Can I take it for x/y/z non-gaming task?</u></p><p>Yes! The ingredients in Athena’s Blessing have been proven to enhance cognitive ability regardless of the task at hand. We use it for work-related purposes, studying, reading long scientific papers.</p><p><u>How long does it last?</u></p><p>The half-life of each ingredient is measured at about 4 hours. We recommend taking two at the start of your day or gaming session and one as needed as the effects wear off. This will top you up and keep you motivated on your road to glory!</p><p><u>I don’t feel anything, why?</u></p><p>We recommend taking Athena’s Blessing on an empty stomach, before a meal, with your favorite source of low-dose caffeine (coffee, tea, latte, etc) in order to provide maximum effect. We also would like to remind our users that the individual ingredients are not active stimulants yet provide benefits through a more passive pathway. The feelings should be subtle. If you do not feel anything we recommend altering your ingestion routine or by moderately increasing the dosage.</p><h3>Thanks again for checking out our campaign, you rock!  See you in-game!</h3><p> </p></div>","Gaming, leveled up.

- Dealing with differences in health agencies in various regions and the differences in their labeling: Did you know names of products could be considered labeling claims?  Neither did we until a couple of months ago, and that's just here in the US of A!  We intend to tread very lightly in regards to compliance with all relevant authorities in order to minimize delays and maximize transparency.
- Variable shipping costs overseas:  As a Canadian, I know customs can delay deliveries, and we expect to learn the hard way that delivery time-frames for different countries will be less consistent that our customers may like.
- Production delays which affect the timing of monthly deliveries for subscription members. Since we will be contracting out our manufacturing (but still testing everything along the way), we have to accept that some things will be outside of our control.  We promise to do our best to overcome any obstacles we face, and will switch manufacturers if our customer's experience is being negatively impacted.
What keeps MoonJi up at night?
- Making sure the website/logo/label/Indiegogo art is cute, informative and on theme:  Building a brand as the only artist on the team is exhausting!
- Integrating sustainable business practices to lower our environmental footprint: No amount of enhancement is worth damaging the planet that we all share, and we are committed to doing everything in our power to be good stewards of our beautiful world.
- Lack of engagement on social media: This is a learning process for us, and we will be relying on feedback both positive and negative from our awesome customers to guide us.

- Educate yourself on what Nootropics are and how they may be beneficial to your daily routine, even if you have determined Athena’s Blessing is not for you!  Our whole goal is to help people game better, but the bigger picture is to help people find out what works best for them!
- Try using Athena’s Blessing for other mentally draining-tasks, even if you are not a gamer.  Let's be honest, the original Athena was a whole lot more into war and heroes and tasks than she was into gaming.

 FAQWhy are you crowdsourcing it?We are crowdsourcing our Nootropic because we love the platform, and it gives us the ability to reach lots of interested people quickly.  If everyone is as excited about Nootropics for gamers as we are, then this is the perfect way to hit the ground running, and get our product into people’s hands as fast as possible.Why do you publish the ingredients and dosage in your stack?We believe in transparency, and a big part of that is knowing exactly what and how much of any ingredient is in our product.  We trust that by always being upfront with our customers we can preemptively answer questions or concerns they might have.Is it safe?Yes, Athena’s Blessing contains 4 ingredients that are GRAS (Generally Regarded As Safe) as well as one that has been used in Ayurvedic medicine since the 6th century and is very well tolerated when taken in the amount in our capsules (Bacopa Monnieri).  Athena's Blessing is produced in an FDA certified GMP (Good Manufacturing Processes) facility and our individual ingredients are tested for purity and the exclusion of heavy metals.  We also 3rd party test our ingredients before production as well as 3rd party test our finished products.How many days in a row can I take it?We suggest cycling off Athena’s blessing when not engaged in strenuous mental activity to make sure you get the most out of it. We don’t suggest any specific schedule as everybody is different and supplements work differently for different people.What are the long-term effects?A sweet K/D ratio and an improved memory!Can I take it for x/y/z non-gaming task?Yes! The ingredients in Athena’s Blessing have been proven to enhance cognitive ability regardless of the task at hand. We use it for work-related purposes, studying, reading long scientific papers.How long does it last?The half-life of each ingredient is measured at about 4 hours. We recommend taking two at the start of your day or gaming session and one as needed as the effects wear off. This will top you up and keep you motivated on your road to glory!I don’t feel anything, why?We recommend taking Athena’s Blessing on an empty stomach, before a meal, with your favorite source of low-dose caffeine (coffee, tea, latte, etc) in order to provide maximum effect. We also would like to remind our users that the individual ingredients are not active stimulants yet provide benefits through a more passive pathway. The feelings should be subtle. If you do not feel anything we recommend altering your ingestion routine or by moderately increasing the dosage.Thanks again for checking out our campaign, you rock!  See you in-game!",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>What is Playa?</h2>
<p>Playa is a new fitness app that will build video playlists for users based on their unique choices. The playlists consist of videos submitted to us by what we call Gurus. Gurus are personal trainers from all around the world that want a way to earn extra cash by uploading videos to the database. Gurus receive  50% of the revenue that Playa earns. </p>

<p>The first step it to make sure the videos are at the audio and visual quality we suggest. Next personal trainers with degrees in physiology review the footage to ensure no dangerous techniques are suggested to users. The final step is checking that all video requirements are met. </p>

<h3>Do the Gurus Earn Money?</h3>
<p>Yes! Gurus receive 50% of the app's revenue. After the payment processing service takes their cut, the remaining $2.60 is split between the Gurus and  Playa. If we make $6,000 in a week, $3,000 of that goes to the Gurus. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How is the money allocated to the individual Gurus?</h3>
<p>The Guru's fund is split evenly by how many videos we have in the database. If the Gurus receive $3,000 over a week and we have 1,000 videos in the database, each video is worth $3. </p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Guru 1 has 10 videos = $30 for the week</p>
<p>Guru 2 has 50 videos = $150 for the week</p>
<p>Guru 3 has 100 = $300 for the week</p>

<h3>Economic Impact of the App.</h3>
<p>Two locations, Fullerton, CA and Stratford, London, UK will be our headquarters for the app. We will be hiring various positions in both locations. Additional personal trainers to vet the videos, people to verify the visual and audio quality as well as ensure all requirements are met, programmers and other positions will be needed at both locations. At least 5 new hires in both locations within the first few months of the app launching. </p>

</div></div>","What is Playa?
Playa is a new fitness app that will build video playlists for users based on their unique choices. The playlists consist of videos submitted to us by what we call Gurus. Gurus are personal trainers from all around the world that want a way to earn extra cash by uploading videos to the database. Gurus receive  50% of the revenue that Playa earns. 

 
How much will it cost for users?
$3/ week
 
What are the workout options? 
Users Choose:
Intensity Level
Location Of Workout
Gender Of Trainer
Type of Workout
Length Of Workout
The app then builds a workout playlist from the videos in our database based on these choices.
 
Where do the videos come from?
Personal Trainers from all over the world. We call them our Gurus. 

 
Can anyone submit a video and become a Guru?
The short answer is yes. Since there is no government regulation on personal trainers we decided not to cut qualified people out from submitting videos by choosing one personal training certification over others. 
 
How do you make sure the videos are safe? 
We have a 3 Step video vetting process. 

Content Quality
Safty 
Guidelines

The first step it to make sure the videos are at the audio and visual quality we suggest. Next personal trainers with degrees in physiology review the footage to ensure no dangerous techniques are suggested to users. The final step is checking that all video requirements are met. 
The video requirements are as followed:

The Guru submitting the video must be in the video. (This is to make sure no content is being stolen.)
Step by Step instruction on how to do the suggested exercise is visually and audibly able to be understood. 
No inappropriate behavior or language is shown in the video. 
Video length. The videos while should be detailed should only be 30 - 60 seconds in length.

If all requirements are met, the video will be added to our database. 

 
Do the Gurus Earn Money?
Yes! Gurus receive 50% of the app's revenue. After the payment processing service takes their cut, the remaining $2.60 is split between the Gurus and  Playa. If we make $6,000 in a week, $3,000 of that goes to the Gurus. 
 
How is the money allocated to the individual Gurus?
The Guru's fund is split evenly by how many videos we have in the database. If the Gurus receive $3,000 over a week and we have 1,000 videos in the database, each video is worth $3. 
Example:
Guru 1 has 10 videos = $30 for the week
Guru 2 has 50 videos = $150 for the week
Guru 3 has 100 = $300 for the week
 
Why not use an investor?

<p>MūvWell's founder, Jordan Oxford, is a yoga student and teacher who believes that there is a better way to share ideas in fitness classes and by personalizing exercises, people can have more success in improving their health. </p>
<p><strong>What has happened so far?</strong></p>
<p>The groundwork has been laid and a plan is in place to develop an app to make this dream come alive. We've partnered with app developers and a fundraising-support company to come up with a plan for creating a successful startup. Major accomplishments include a clickable prototype, a professional product explainer video, a professional website, strategy for development completion, an early network of instructors eager to use the new platform, and much more. </p>
<p><strong>What are we trying to do?</strong></p>
<p>The goal is to help anyone who wants to feel better in their body. The idea behind having a fitness platform you can personalize is so that no matter what works or doesn't work for you, MūvWell makes it easy to give your body just what it needs to be fit and healthy.  </p>
<p>We want to raise enough money to continue the work and execute the plan we've come up with. Our goal is to take the work we've done so far and to pay for the business services it will take to turn it into a viable formal business plan to present to our future investors.</p>
<p><strong>What will it take to make this happen?</strong></p>
<p>It will cost another 30k to build early content for product validation and to pay for business services to build a proper investor presentation. That second round of investment funding will raise the 150k it will take to fulfill our first-year business needs and see app development through to the launch of the app.</p>
<p><strong>What is this campaign money for?</strong></p>
<p>What's important now is to be able to pay for the remaining business services it will take to set this plan in motion. By succeeding in our 30k goal we'll be able to solidify a viable business plan and investor pitch deck for the next round of funding. If we are over-funded we can start immediately on our next development phase.</p>
<p><strong>What can we offer in return?</strong></p>
<p>In return for early support, we're offering tiers of incentives to give back as much as we can to early supporters. Early supporters will be remembered and bonus perks will continue to be offered to those who helped us out early on. </p>

<p>In 2009, Rudolf Gotsmi, himself a passionate athlete as well as a trained fitness and soccer coach, commenced the development of a new training device that combines the advantages of earlier fitness equipment and at the same time provides new training dimensions. While most commercial fitness equipment is only designed for certain regions of the body or for an individual training goal - balance, stability, coordination or strength - the FitW is the optimum fitness device for all regions of the body and for all target groups. From the first idea for the FitW fitness cube to the development of prototypes and material tests, he has worked away meticulously for 7 years. In cooperation with proven fitness experts and top athletes - such as the world cup racing skier, Katharina Gallhuber or the downhill amateur champion, Rade Curcic -  the FitW has been optimized and was finally brought onto the market in September 2016.</p>

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>Hello! We are a group of undergraduate students at The Ohio State University from diverse backgrounds and disciplines seeking to help cancer patients, defend people from bacterial infections, and advance the field of synthetic biology. Our team is new to Ohio State and we offer a fantastic research opportunity to driven undergraduate students.</p>
<h3>Our Project</h3>
<p>This year, our team is focused on improving production of a potent antibiotic and chemotherapy alternative compound, cordycepin. The team is aiming to isolate the genetic pathway that produces cordycepin from the mushroom in which it naturally occurs and relocate it into an organism that can be grown more efficiently and cost-effectively. This is our main research objective. In terms of outreach, we intend to educate younger students about the emerging field of synthetic biology and dispel myths surrounding genetic engineering as well as teach about antibiotic resistance and the discovery process of new antibiotic compounds.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What is iGEM?</h3>
<p>We are Ohio State's first iGEM team. iGEM is an international genetic engineering competition in which undergraduate students from around the world design and build novel organisms with applications in healthcare, environmental solutions, entrepreneurship, and more. In addition to research, iGEM includes volunteering, networking, and educating. Teams work throughout the year on fundraising and outreach. Over the summer and beginning of the next school year, undergraduate students actually execute their project designs, test the products, and work on iGEM requirements. At the end of October, the teams travel to Boston to present and compete at the Giant Jamboree.</p>
<h3>What we Need</h3>
<p>We have come to Indiegogo to ask for help in supporting our team! While our team and research have the potential to make a huge impact, there are many steps we need funding to complete. Here is an outline of our budget:</p>
<p>     Team Competition Registration: $4,500 (early registration fee)</p>
<p>     Individual Jamboree Registration: $695 x Jamboree Attendee</p>
<p>     Research Materials: Estimated &lt;$1,000</p>
<p>     Hotel Rooms: About $100 per room per night (3 nights)</p>
<p>     Transportation: Round trip bus tickets = $131 per passenger</p>
<p>     Student Stipends: $1,500-$2,000 per student depending how many stay over the summer +           how much total money is raised</p>
<p>Indiegogo funding will go to the most time-sensitive expense--currently, this is team registration for iGEM. Registration will give us access to crucial research materials and team resources. Jamboree attendance is another major expense; however, this is the culmination of iGEM and allows students to present their research alongside their peers from around the world. It is a great way to get project feedback and publicity. </p>
<p>Additional funding is being sought from our university and corporate donors. If you cannot contribute to our campaign but have connections to a company that supports student-led research and innovative healthcare, we would dearly appreciate you forwarding our project information to them. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The beauty of iGEM teams is that they give back in so many ways. While the most obvious benefit to funding our program is aiding the development of an innovative healthcare project, contributions will also help us educate younger students, tighten our campus community, and help budding scientists launch careers with humanitarian goals. </p>
<p>Especially as this is the first year of iGEM at The Ohio State University, we are so appreciative of your efforts to help us get off the ground and into meaningful research. Our team is truly a group of students united by curiosity and compassion. We all want to make a difference, both in our professional fields and in people's personal lives. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Thank you so much for your interest in our campaign! If you cannot contribute financially, we would still very much appreciate you using Indiegogo's share tools and being vocal about our project on social media. If you know of any companies that may be interested in helping our team, we offer advertising opportunities for corporate sponsors. Please send along our contact and/or project information! </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>What if we had an automated, remote test for the novel coronavirus disease, COVD-19, based on user-reported symptoms and data?</p>
<p>Covid19orNo.com is a HIPAA-compliant website that tracks your symptoms and provides you with applicable guidance from the U.S. CDC and WHO websites based on your symptoms.</p>
<p>Covid19orNo.com also allows you to compare your symptoms, over time, to the symptoms experienced by actual COVID-19 patients.</p>
<p>And of particular interest to the CDC, covid19orno.com tracks symptoms and locations from anyone in the world.</p>
<p>At the moment, Covid19orNo.com does not diagnose the disease, it simply shares publicly available information in an interactive and easy to understand format. With funds from this campaign, we hope to use machine learning to uncover a reliable symptom pattern signature for identifying COVID-19 (Coronavirus 2019 disease). We are currently initiating a clinical literature review to build a data set to develop our algorithm.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>I caught a cold at the same time that the news began heavily focusing on coronavirus and COVID-19 began sweeping through the San Francisco Bay Area, where I live. I hid in my room and watched the world slowly come to a halt. My only source of comfort was reading medical papers about the onset and progression of COVID-19 symptoms.</p>
<p>By arming myself with knowledge, I felt less panicked. It inspired me to share my research with the rest of the world in an interactive and easy-to-understand format.</p>
<p><strong>About Me</strong></p>
<p>I've been dreaming about starting a website that empowers people to ""own"" their health for years. Before creating Covid19orNo.com, I founded a company called UserWise, a consultancy focused on reducing preventable medical error worldwide. At UserWise, we perform safety assessments to help medical product developers to comply with U.S. and international regulations.</p>
<p>Before UserWise, I was a Human Factors Engineer at Intuitive Surgical, where I worked on da Vinci surgical systems, instruments, and accessories including the da Vinci Xi Surgical Robotic System and da Vinci Sp Surgical Robotic System.</p>
<p>In 2012, I completed Abbott Laboratories' Professional Development Program, working in various supervisory, R&amp;D, Quality and Regulatory functions in divisions including Abbott Vascular, Abbott Diagnostics, Abbott Diabetes Care, and Abbott Medical Optics.</p>
<p>I graduated in 2010 from UCLA with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and a technical breadth in Technology Management. I'm a Certified Professional Industrial Engineer, I hold two patents, and I've written and published three books.</p>

<p>So far I've invested approximately $10,000 of my own resources to develop and test the site. However, I am seeking an additional $10,000 to help make this project a success. Here's where the upcoming funding will go:</p>
<ul>
<li>Promotion: $2,500<ul>
<li>We plan to use ads to spread the word.</li>
<li>Our goal is to get at least 10,000 people to fill out the quiz.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Website Maintenance and Daily Fact Checking: $2,500<ul><li>We make sure that the website is up to date daily; every day we ensure that the website matches the latest content on the CDC and WHO websites regarding COVID-19.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Clinical Data Analysis and reporting: $5,000<ul>
<li>We are collecting known data on symptom onset to build a ""COVID-19 positive"" dataset</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>If we don't reach our goal, we will develop this product as far as we can, and then we'll pursue other means of investment to plow forward.</li>

</ul>
<p>In summary, you'll get a 3-page synthesis of the medical literature regarding symptom progression and a website with the potential to increase public safety by:</p>

What if we had an automated, remote test for the novel coronavirus disease, COVD-19, based on user-reported symptoms and data?
Covid19orNo.com is a HIPAA-compliant website that tracks your symptoms and provides you with applicable guidance from the U.S. CDC and WHO websites based on your symptoms.
Covid19orNo.com also allows you to compare your symptoms, over time, to the symptoms experienced by actual COVID-19 patients.
And of particular interest to the CDC, covid19orno.com tracks symptoms and locations from anyone in the world.
At the moment, Covid19orNo.com does not diagnose the disease, it simply shares publicly available information in an interactive and easy to understand format. With funds from this campaign, we hope to use machine learning to uncover a reliable symptom pattern signature for identifying COVID-19 (Coronavirus 2019 disease). We are currently initiating a clinical literature review to build a data set to develop our algorithm.
Background
I caught a cold at the same time that the news began heavily focusing on coronavirus and COVID-19 began sweeping through the San Francisco Bay Area, where I live. I hid in my room and watched the world slowly come to a halt. My only source of comfort was reading medical papers about the onset and progression of COVID-19 symptoms.
By arming myself with knowledge, I felt less panicked. It inspired me to share my research with the rest of the world in an interactive and easy-to-understand format.
About Me
I've been dreaming about starting a website that empowers people to ""own"" their health for years. Before creating Covid19orNo.com, I founded a company called UserWise, a consultancy focused on reducing preventable medical error worldwide. At UserWise, we perform safety assessments to help medical product developers to comply with U.S. and international regulations.
Before UserWise, I was a Human Factors Engineer at Intuitive Surgical, where I worked on da Vinci surgical systems, instruments, and accessories including the da Vinci Xi Surgical Robotic System and da Vinci Sp Surgical Robotic System.
In 2012, I completed Abbott Laboratories' Professional Development Program, working in various supervisory, R&D, Quality and Regulatory functions in divisions including Abbott Vascular, Abbott Diagnostics, Abbott Diabetes Care, and Abbott Medical Optics.
I graduated in 2010 from UCLA with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and a technical breadth in Technology Management. I'm a Certified Professional Industrial Engineer, I hold two patents, and I've written and published three books.

What We Need & What You Get
So far I've invested approximately $10,000 of my own resources to develop and test the site. However, I am seeking an additional $10,000 to help make this project a success. Here's where the upcoming funding will go:

Promotion: $2,500
We plan to use ads to spread the word.
Our goal is to get at least 10,000 people to fill out the quiz.


Website Maintenance and Daily Fact Checking: $2,500We make sure that the website is up to date daily; every day we ensure that the website matches the latest content on the CDC and WHO websites regarding COVID-19.

Clinical Data Analysis and reporting: $5,000
We are collecting known data on symptom onset to build a ""COVID-19 positive"" dataset
You will be the first to receive our 3-page synthesis of the medical literature regarding symptom progression!


(Future) U.S. FDA-testing and clearance
Pursuing FDA clearance costs $31 Million on average[1]. However, with my experience with software testing and FDA regulatory submissions, I believe I can significantly reduce costs. Also, a software-only platform is cheaper to develop and test than medical device hardware.
Safety is our top priority in developing this product. We will not be ""cutting any corners"" and software will be developed in a manner fully compliant with U.S. and international regulations.


If we don't reach our goal, we will develop this product as far as we can, and then we'll pursue other means of investment to plow forward.
Also, if we hit regulatory roadblocks and COVID-19 subsides in the meantime, we would pivot this technology to treat other conditions.

In summary, you'll get a 3-page synthesis of the medical literature regarding symptom progression and a website with the potential to increase public safety by:

Promoting understanding of COVID-19 symptoms among the public
Promoting awareness of what actions to take based on symptoms
Arming the public with knowledge about how the disease can appear over time
Tracking where COVID-19 is headed (geographically) [note: this is a future goal]
Potentially determining whether someone should get tested for COVID-19 in an automated fashion
Potentially diagnosing COVID-19 using machine learning

</div></div>","Tramigo Heart has been one of the best kept secrets in Tramigo's history. The project codename was Sampo, referring to the ancient Finnish mythology of a sacred artifact which will bring fortune to its bearer.
Latest security and safety related events in Europe and globally made us
 realize we need to expedite our original release timelines and for that
 we need your help.
Our goal was not only to develop a technically brilliant safety device, tracker or locator, but something elegant, fun and even healthy.


We believe it's all about connections, to time, to a place, to a state, to a valuable asset or to each other - our loved ones.
Tramigo has been a pioneer in the GPS business since 2002. Years of
experience in vehicle tracking in tough markets and dangerous areas has
taught our team to focus on end-users' need for peace of mind and how
important user friendly and practical features are. 
And, yes, we have had our failures on the way, but have learned and risen. We always wanted to develop the best and we have finally done it. Now we ask the world - do you want it?
Connect with us and let's make it alive!





Let us introduce you to haptic technology - touch your Tramigo Heart and make your friend feel it.
With the Heart button you can connect with your friends, send an SOS alarm, activate a motion alarm or a geofence, check the battery level or even configure your device to control 3rd party devices. The beauty lies in the haptic response: 
- you can feel if your friend is lost- you can feel when someone received your SOS alarm- you can feel the battery level - no more blinking lights or slow app!





(Disclaimer: Your cat could also feel your call but still decide not to come...)

Our industrial design, hardware and software design are from Finland.Tramigo has been developing various GPS devices for over a decade andwe have global support to help you in all your needs.
Our industrial design was driven by the following key points:* Easy to personalize - the whole front side is available for your own art* Simple - only one button, feel the response, can also be easily attached* Waterproof and durable - no electronic connectors or lights
For base color, we decided to start first with snow white aka innocent white.Depending on your feedback, we'll be adding more colors!

And here's the summary of our top-notch features so you can focus onthings which are important to you without having to worry about the technology.Hardware features:#gps #agps #glonass #gsm #gprs #bluetooth #accelerometer #cloud #tld  #waterproof #shockproof #longbatterylife #diameter48mm #thickness15mm#wirelesscharging #singlebuttoninterface #easytoattach #easytopersonalizeWireless Charging gives you the easiest way to recharge the battery and Heart Bluetooth Beacon can be used to locate Hearts for example indoors. You can have Beacons in different rooms to pinpoint the short-range locations. Excellent way to expand the location info indoors and also the battery life!We believe remote love can work - especially when you are connecting to yourHeart via Tramigo Cloud. We have developed our Cloud based system since 2014 and it is already in use with existing Tramigo car security and fleet management devices.To start using the device couldn't be easier - simply put your device onthe wireless charging pad (yes, it's 2015 and even Deloreans were supposedto fly, who would charge a device anymore with a wire..?) and feel it wake up.Software features:                                                                                              #realtimetracking #locationondemand #motionalarm #geofence #lowpoweralarm #sosalarm #fallalarm #pairing #grouping #sharing #emailalarms #smsalarms #encryption #historytrail #statistics #tld #otaupdate 



Each Heart comes with a Magic Cloud Code printed on it. 
1. Use the code to pair your phone app or web account with your device.2. Share the access to your friends.
We take security and privacy seriously and give you the option to use the devicefully anonymously or register through our browser/app interface. From UI you cansee the latest status of the device, choose the profile you want to use andchange the settings to personalize the device for your optimal use cases.

<h4>Q: How does this work?</h4>
<p>To obtain indexes you should follow the below protocol:</p>
<ol>
<li>Attach finger to phone camera and start recording</li>
<li>Take a lying position following instruction from the device</li>
<li>Relax and keep lying for 4 minutes</li>
<li>Stand up following instruction from the device, keep standing for 4 minutes</li>
<li>The recording stops automatically after collecting all necessary data</li>
<li>The device sends the data to processing center and receives results to display</li>
</ol>
<p>When the person stands up there is a deep drop in arterial pressure, and we measure the organism’s ability to restore pressure to the normal level by using different physiological mechanisms. Impairments in these mechanisms are related to impairments in health. This response was scientifically proved to predict most chronic diseases like the development of chronic pain.</p>
<h4>
<a href=""https://git.bodyadvises.com/backoffice/dataproxy/wikis/indiegogo-testing#q-why-you-launch-two-mobile-apps"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>Q: Why do you launch two mobile apps?</h4>
<p>Technically it is possible to create one mobile app for all indexes. However, we are on the start point. Several simpler apps help us to be more flexible in the R&amp;D and better fit with user requirements.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 24px; background-color: initial;"">Q: Can I try it right now?</span><br/></p>
<p>Yes! We have a demo mobile apps already available for iOS and Android. You can easily find it at the app stores by keyword Salutex. However, it only includes overall health indexes.</p>
<h4>
<a href=""https://git.bodyadvises.com/backoffice/dataproxy/wikis/indiegogo-testing#q-does-anybody-already-use-this-technology"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>Q: Does anybody already use this technology?</h4>
<p>Yes. This technology have been successfully used for US Worker's compensation legal cases. Nobody else can give such an objective and complex metric for an individual health status.</p>
<h4>Q: Why is the subscription model?</h4>
<p>Because we do not use your phone for data precessing. The algorithms are not simple and require some processing power. There is a cost for processing data for every measurement.</p>
</div><div>
<h4>Q: Do I need to type some additional data like my gender?</h4>
<p>We never ask for personal information like your income, gender, age, diagnoses, phone number, etc. We never ask you to type what you eat or how much is your weight. We never ask your chest size, skin color or how much you move or drink. Most demographic variables, life style and behavioral activities influence on your body signals and our apps detects and translates them in health status numbers you obtain.</p>

We will provide tools to monitor conditions over time and see the changes. And this is only the beginning!                    




""This biobehavioral protocol enables measurement of chronic pain suffering and protection in three dimensions: physical, emotional, and cognitive."" (Physiology & Behavior 152 203–216. (doi:10.1016/j.physbeh.2015.09.029))
""This study showed that genetic predispositions regarding coagulation are modifiable, which could promote advanced protection against haemorrhages in varieties of traumas and injuries, especially in individuals with coagulation deficits.""(Scientific Reports 5 10703. (doi:10.1038/srep10703))

The chronic pain is deeply personal suffering. How do people
describe it? The pain is stronger, weaker, worse. But how much? To what extent
is it worse, stronger or weaker? And this is all we can get from an individual
who can tell us about his or her condition assessing the pain internally by own
subjective scale. But what if he or she cannot? Then nobody knows how good or
bad he or she feels... Scientists say that there is no evidence that any
subjective scale developed by medical and healthcare community can reliably measure pain in individual.






We create a tool which will assist people to objectively 
assess chronic pain severity. No words needed, just measurement. For you or for those you care after.
You will learn how helpful medications or exercises are and can share this information with your doctor to find better personal solution.
This technology have been successfully used in Workers' compensation legal cases.










We all know that blood is essential for any mammal on our planet. And it is normal for the body to resist to blood loss. However statistical data say that our bodies do not always effectively resist to blood loss due to some negative events, processes and conditions:






It is not so quick and easy to find out if you or your nearest are at risk. If you have no information then you cannot prepare. We will change this.


Our study shows that even genetically determined predisposition to haemorrhage can be modified by conditioning mechanisms. And you will have the opportunity to cope with it by a physical training before the challenge.
We will create a simple mobile app that will let anyone to detect a risk of over-bleeding in minutes, anywhere. It is a replacement for invasive testing (no more visits to doctor and blood analyses). 











Q: How does this work?
To obtain indexes you should follow the below protocol:

Attach finger to phone camera and start recording
Take a lying position following instruction from the device
Relax and keep lying for 4 minutes
Stand up following instruction from the device, keep standing for 4 minutes
The recording stops automatically after collecting all necessary data
The device sends the data to processing center and receives results to display

When the person stands up there is a deep drop in arterial pressure, and we measure the organism’s ability to restore pressure to the normal level by using different physiological mechanisms. Impairments in these mechanisms are related to impairments in health. This response was scientifically proved to predict most chronic diseases like the development of chronic pain.

Q: Why do you launch two mobile apps?
Technically it is possible to create one mobile app for all indexes. However, we are on the start point. Several simpler apps help us to be more flexible in the R&D and better fit with user requirements.
Q: Can I try it right now?
Yes! We have a demo mobile apps already available for iOS and Android. You can easily find it at the app stores by keyword Salutex. However, it only includes overall health indexes.

Q: Does anybody already use this technology?
Yes. This technology have been successfully used for US Worker's compensation legal cases. Nobody else can give such an objective and complex metric for an individual health status.
Q: Why is the subscription model?
Because we do not use your phone for data precessing. The algorithms are not simple and require some processing power. There is a cost for processing data for every measurement.

Q: Do I need to type some additional data like my gender?
We never ask for personal information like your income, gender, age, diagnoses, phone number, etc. We never ask you to type what you eat or how much is your weight. We never ask your chest size, skin color or how much you move or drink. Most demographic variables, life style and behavioral activities influence on your body signals and our apps detects and translates them in health status numbers you obtain.



We develop a truly disruptive technology and we need your help to get it out of the lab and bring to people. We strive to let people use products based on latest scientific findings. What else these findings for!
We are small but passionate team, we can do a lot with your help!

We consider that everybody is dreaming about different possible future realities. We develop an instrument you can use to create a kind of future realities you would be happy to live. 
We want everyone to live to their fullest!

Weighing myself daily using a WiThings WiFi Scale, my weight, lean mass and fat mass were recorded electronically. Over a six-week period I dropped over 35lbs. More importantly, when I did the statistical analysis from my data, not only did I drop 15% of my total body weight, but I lost 35% of my total fat mass as opposed to only 9% of my total lean body mass. The results spoke for themselves. The combination of ingredients in Get Lean work; even better than I could have imagined.

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Its important because there are millions of us out there struggling with weight. We are stressed out, hungry and maybe feeling a little hopeless. I want you to know that you don’t have to feel that way! I believe that the toughest hurdle in weight loss for most people is controlling hunger. When you’re not hungry, you’re not over-eating or eating at the wrong times. When you’re not hungry, you’re making healthier food choices and eating intuitively rather than impulsively! When you’re not hungry, you’re not as likely to fail at reaching your goal! </span></p>
<p></p>
<p>Get Lean has a potent combination of two very effective, all-natural appetite suppressants. But controlling hunger is not enough. You have to keep your metabolism up while you are dieting. Reduced calorie diets can slow your metabolism and kill your weight loss progress. There are 15 different Thermogenic Fat Metabolizing ingredients in Get Lean that will keep your metabolism revved while you lose weight. But you'll also need to control your stress if you want to lose weight effectively! Get Lean’s five all-natural ingredients aimed at fighting stress are proven to reduce the amount of Cortis<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">ol in the body. Cortisol can keep you from losing weight because it slows your metabolism and stimulates the body to store fat. Get Lean’s Stress Metabolizers help eliminate Cortisol in the body to keep your body in fat burning mode. In fact, every organic ingredient in Get Lean is targeted at eliminating the roadblocks that can keep you from reaching your weight loss goals. They squash your hunger, fight your stress and stimulate your metabolism to burn  fat. Its a simple solution to a complex problem.</span></p>

<p>The risks involved in this project surround funding. We need to place a substantial minimum order with our CGMP Supplement Manufacturer that is substantial. They were chosen based on a long list of critical factors. One advantage of our chosen Manufacturer was a short lead time to delivery of the product. We felt this was an added benefit to our backers, ensuring they would receive their perks in a timely manner. But in order to be fair and to make sure we can cover the substantial minimum order, we have chosen a Fixed Campaign. Therefore, if we do not raise enough to meet our target funds, all monies will be returned. If this were to occur, our launch date would be pushed back until alternative funding sources were secured. </p>
<p>We strongly believe that Get Lean will be the highest quality, custom crafted supplement stack available in the market. We are working hard to ensure its success. Your financial support is vital.

<p><b>Can I just recreate this stack on my own?</b></p>
<p>Absolutely. You can go out and buy all of the ingredients in this stack through separate supplements and you will get results. The main benefit to GET LEAN is that the total number of capsules you would need to swallow is far fewer and the total out of pocket cost for the stack is much, much less. In addition to the dramatic cost savings and simplicity of a single supplement, you'll get the added benefit of knowing that GET LEAN has only the highest quality combination of organic ingredients. That is a key focus in our custom blend. When you buy multiple supplements separately from different manufacturers, you increase the chances that one or more of the purchased supplements contains lower quality ingredients. I'm referencing the the incident from February of this year where it was discovered that many popular herbal supplements at Target, Walmart and Walgreens stores weren't what their labels claimed, according to DNA testing that had found numerous store brand supplements to be fake or highly adulterated and contaminated. GET LEAN's ingredients are guaranteed 100% pure, organic and unadulterated. With GET LEAN, you can be confident in what you are putting into your body.<br/></p>
<p><b>How much did you exercise while you were taking the ingredients in GET LEAN?</b></p>
<p>Honestly, not very much. I am not a hardcore gym rat or exercise fanatic. I'm a 46 year old regular guy with children ages 7, 12, 13 and 14. I work as a Sales Executive in the steel industry and my job and family keep me very busy.  I am not left with much time to exercise, if at all. I belong to a gym, but I am embarrassed to say that I haven't been there in months. I have a stationary bicycle that I ride on average 4 hours a week. That was the extent of my exercise during my six week weight loss program. No more and no less than prior to beginning the process.</p>
<p><b>Your total weight, BMI and body fat percentage isn't that impressive, why should I trust someone that isn't in top shape about a weight loss product?</b></p>
<p>There are many, many reasons why you should. First, I'm just an average guy. If you're an average guy or girl looking for a weight loss supplement, you should look to someone similar to yourself who has achieved their weight loss goals in order to be successful yourself. If you look to bodybuilders or fitness trainers, you will probably struggle more to succeed. Bodybuilders and fitness trainers sometimes workout for 14 or more hours a week. Its their job. Unless you can do the same, you will probably have trouble duplicating their success. I'm 46, have kids, a job and lead a busy life. After years of research, trials, struggles, and great expense, I discovered a stack that really works in spite of all that. If you're like me and you struggle to find the time to exercise regularly, sometimes don't eat the healthiest diet because your always hungry or deal with stress in your daily life, Get Lean is a winning solution. It will help you lose weight without being hungry and you won't have to turn yourself into a gym rat to see results. </p>
<p>Second, I would be highly skeptical of weight loss supplements with pitch men or women who are just too physically perfect. They are likely paid models or professional trainers who put weight on by abandoning their normal routine and then lost it all by returning to their normal routine of intense exercise and strict diet. Most of us just can't do that with our hectic lives. This is a recipe for failure and often creates frustration and feelings of hopelessness. Get Lean works for average people who lead normal lives. No matter how busy, how stressed or how many times they have struggled in the past. All that is required is to take Get Lean regularly and have the desire to lose weight.</p>
<p>Lastly, weight loss is a process. Yes, I am proud of the fact that I lost 35lbs. But I also know that I want to drop even more weight. My goal is to get my total body fat down to approximately 15lbs, which would put me around 190lbs and under 8% body fat. I know I can get there with the help of Get Lean, but I also know that it will take more time to do so. Your body goes through weight loss plateaus and losing too much weight too fast isn't always that good for you. The easiest weight to lose is always the weight that was most recently gained because you body still sees that weight as being ""abnormal"". My ""normal"" weight for most of my late thirties and early forties was around 220lbs and I have typically gained weight and then lost it again plateauing around the 220lbs area. With Get Lean, I greatly surpassed my goals and lost 11lbs more than my ""normal"" weight, but that first 24lbs was the quickest to come off. Losing an additional 19lbs or so beyond the 209lbs mark might take me a little bit longer, but I know I will get there if I stick to using Get Lean stack and adjusting my diet/ exercise whenever I hit a plateau. And by sticking with the program and taking time for my body to adjust, I will trigger my body to set a new lower ""normal"" weight. It has worked for em and I know it will work for you too! </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>How long will I have to wait to receive my bottle(s) of GET LEAN?</b></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;"">We anticipate being able to deliver the product within 8 weeks after successful funding. That is 8 weeks from the time we are funded until the time it arrives at your doorstep. Our Current Good Manufacturing Processor (CGMP) has assured us of this timeline. We will do everything we can to ensure that you receive your product as expediently as possible and will keep you informed of all developments in an effort to be completely transparent throughout this process. Our hope is that we can deliver GET LEAN to our backers earlier than our stated goal and will work toward making that happen.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>What makes GET LEAN any different than the host of other weight loss supplements already available in the market today?</b></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;"">GET LEAN is different from the host of other weight loss supplements currently available because of its unique, custom crafted blend of 19 all-natural, organic ingredients. You probably recognize or have tried some of the ingredients in GET LEAN, but I would bet that there are more than a few that you haven't. More importantly, I know you haven't tried this potent combination. Yes, you might be able to find a supplement that has one, two, three or more of the ingredients in GET LEAN, but you won't find any out there with GET LEAN's potent, carefully designed combination. Each ingredient was carefully researched and selected to give you and your body, the best possible chance of succeeding at your weight loss goals. GET LEAN's ingredients squash your hunger, rid your body of fat-storing cortisol, and supercharge your metabolism to burn off its fat stores. GET LEAN's unique blend of lesser known, but highly effective ingredients like Carralluma Fimbriata, Evodiamine, and Ashwagandha sets it heads and shoulders above the multitude of other weight loss supplements available in the market today.</span></p>
</div></div>","Get Lean is a Thermogenic Fat Burning Supplement Stack designed to help you lose weight without feeling hungry. It combines Fat Metabolizers, Stress Metabolizers and Appetite Suppressants that work together to burn your fat, conserve your muscle and squash your hunger. The stack is a well-researched blend of 19 all-natural ingredients. After successfully using these same ingredients to shed my unwanted weight, I knew I had to share this powerful stack with everyone. I formed Voss Nutraceuticals to deliver these same proven organic ingredients into a single, high-quality supplement stack that’s simple, effective and affordable. Its the synergistic combination of ingredients in Get Lean that make it so powerful. How do I know this? Because they worked for me. On April 18th, of this year, I weighed in at over 244lbs. I began taking the stack of ingredients in Get Lean using separate over-the-counter supplements. In order to do this,  I had to take 17 different supplements and over 25 pills a day. It was expensive and not very simple. For disclosure, I am 46 years old and a busy father with four young children. I do not have much time to exercise if at all. During this process, I did not increase my exercise or purposely starve myself. I just made healthier food choices and ate less because I found that I was no longer hungry. Weighing myself daily using a WiThings WiFi Scale, my weight, lean mass and fat mass were recorded electronically. Over a six-week period I dropped over 35lbs. More importantly, when I did the statistical analysis from my data, not only did I drop 15% of my total body weight, but I lost 35% of my total fat mass as opposed to only 9% of my total lean body mass. The results spoke for themselves. The combination of ingredients in Get Lean work; even better than I could have imagined. I plan on continuing to drop more weight and hopefully finding some time to work out at the gym to add back a bit of muscle. Best of all, with Get Lean, I know I will reach my goals.











Its important because there are millions of us out there struggling with weight. We are stressed out, hungry and maybe feeling a little hopeless. I want you to know that you don’t have to feel that way! I believe that the toughest hurdle in weight loss for most people is controlling hunger. When you’re not hungry, you’re not over-eating or eating at the wrong times. When you’re not hungry, you’re making healthier food choices and eating intuitively rather than impulsively! When you’re not hungry, you’re not as likely to fail at reaching your goal! 

Get Lean has a potent combination of two very effective, all-natural appetite suppressants. But controlling hunger is not enough. You have to keep your metabolism up while you are dieting. Reduced calorie diets can slow your metabolism and kill your weight loss progress. There are 15 different Thermogenic Fat Metabolizing ingredients in Get Lean that will keep your metabolism revved while you lose weight. But you'll also need to control your stress if you want to lose weight effectively! Get Lean’s five all-natural ingredients aimed at fighting stress are proven to reduce the amount of Cortisol in the body. Cortisol can keep you from losing weight because it slows your metabolism and stimulates the body to store fat. Get Lean’s Stress Metabolizers help eliminate Cortisol in the body to keep your body in fat burning mode. In fact, every organic ingredient in Get Lean is targeted at eliminating the roadblocks that can keep you from reaching your weight loss goals. They squash your hunger, fight your stress and stimulate your metabolism to burn  fat. Its a simple solution to a complex problem.









Indiegogo, we need your help to bring this simple, affordable and effective weight-loss stack to anyone that wants to shed unwanted weight without feeling hungry. We are looking to raise $15,000 to launch our product in a little over eight weeks after funding closes. The money will be used to:

Contract with an FDA-Approved, NSF certified, CGMP Manufacturer to produce the product at-scale for lower overall production costs.
Source the purest, highest quality, organic ingredients from around the world.
Test and verify the formula’s composition for quality and purity for GMP Compliance from a certified laboratory. 
Submit and receive approval on the Supplement Facts panel.
Cover the costs for Blending, Encapsulating, Bottling, the Bottle and all of its accessories (Desiccant Pack for freshness, Cotton Stuffer, Lid, Heat Induction Seal under the Cap, and Tamper Proof Neck Band Seal), Labeling, and Bulk Shipment.
Deliver Get Lean to our early backers in a timely and efficient time frame of 8 weeks once we have received our funding.

How much did you exercise while you were taking the ingredients in GET LEAN?
Honestly, not very much. I am not a hardcore gym rat or exercise fanatic. I'm a 46 year old regular guy with children ages 7, 12, 13 and 14. I work as a Sales Executive in the steel industry and my job and family keep me very busy.  I am not left with much time to exercise, if at all. I belong to a gym, but I am embarrassed to say that I haven't been there in months. I have a stationary bicycle that I ride on average 4 hours a week. That was the extent of my exercise during my six week weight loss program. No more and no less than prior to beginning the process.
Your total weight, BMI and body fat percentage isn't that impressive, why should I trust someone that isn't in top shape about a weight loss product?
There are many, many reasons why you should. First, I'm just an average guy. If you're an average guy or girl looking for a weight loss supplement, you should look to someone similar to yourself who has achieved their weight loss goals in order to be successful yourself. If you look to bodybuilders or fitness trainers, you will probably struggle more to succeed. Bodybuilders and fitness trainers sometimes workout for 14 or more hours a week. Its their job. Unless you can do the same, you will probably have trouble duplicating their success. I'm 46, have kids, a job and lead a busy life. After years of research, trials, struggles, and great expense, I discovered a stack that really works in spite of all that. If you're like me and you struggle to find the time to exercise regularly, sometimes don't eat the healthiest diet because your always hungry or deal with stress in your daily life, Get Lean is a winning solution. It will help you lose weight without being hungry and you won't have to turn yourself into a gym rat to see results. 
Second, I would be highly skeptical of weight loss supplements with pitch men or women who are just too physically perfect. They are likely paid models or professional trainers who put weight on by abandoning their normal routine and then lost it all by returning to their normal routine of intense exercise and strict diet. Most of us just can't do that with our hectic lives. This is a recipe for failure and often creates frustration and feelings of hopelessness. Get Lean works for average people who lead normal lives. No matter how busy, how stressed or how many times they have struggled in the past. All that is required is to take Get Lean regularly and have the desire to lose weight.
Lastly, weight loss is a process. Yes, I am proud of the fact that I lost 35lbs. But I also know that I want to drop even more weight. My goal is to get my total body fat down to approximately 15lbs, which would put me around 190lbs and under 8% body fat. I know I can get there with the help of Get Lean, but I also know that it will take more time to do so. Your body goes through weight loss plateaus and losing too much weight too fast isn't always that good for you. The easiest weight to lose is always the weight that was most recently gained because you body still sees that weight as being ""abnormal"". My ""normal"" weight for most of my late thirties and early forties was around 220lbs and I have typically gained weight and then lost it again plateauing around the 220lbs area. With Get Lean, I greatly surpassed my goals and lost 11lbs more than my ""normal"" weight, but that first 24lbs was the quickest to come off. Losing an additional 19lbs or so beyond the 209lbs mark might take me a little bit longer, but I know I will get there if I stick to using Get Lean stack and adjusting my diet/ exercise whenever I hit a plateau. And by sticking with the program and taking time for my body to adjust, I will trigger my body to set a new lower ""normal"" weight. It has worked for em and I know it will work for you too! 
How long will I have to wait to receive my bottle(s) of GET LEAN?
We anticipate being able to deliver the product within 8 weeks after successful funding. That is 8 weeks from the time we are funded until the time it arrives at your doorstep. Our Current Good Manufacturing Processor (CGMP) has assured us of this timeline. We will do everything we can to ensure that you receive your product as expediently as possible and will keep you informed of all developments in an effort to be completely transparent throughout this process. Our hope is that we can deliver GET LEAN to our backers earlier than our stated goal and will work toward making that happen.
What makes GET LEAN any different than the host of other weight loss supplements already available in the market today?
GET LEAN is different from the host of other weight loss supplements currently available because of its unique, custom crafted blend of 19 all-natural, organic ingredients. You probably recognize or have tried some of the ingredients in GET LEAN, but I would bet that there are more than a few that you haven't. More importantly, I know you haven't tried this potent combination. Yes, you might be able to find a supplement that has one, two, three or more of the ingredients in GET LEAN, but you won't find any out there with GET LEAN's potent, carefully designed combination. Each ingredient was carefully researched and selected to give you and your body, the best possible chance of succeeding at your weight loss goals. GET LEAN's ingredients squash your hunger, rid your body of fat-storing cortisol, and supercharge your metabolism to burn off its fat stores. GET LEAN's unique blend of lesser known, but highly effective ingredients like Carralluma Fimbriata, Evodiamine, and Ashwagandha sets it heads and shoulders above the multitude of other weight loss supplements available in the market today.",21.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>My sheltie, Roxy, was attacked on Thursday night (8/1), by a rottweiler.  I was out of town with her and my other dogs, and she was rushed to the local emergency vet, bleeding from her abdomen.  She was found dragging her behind, so I anticipated broken bones / spine, but thankfully, the vet took x-rays and found everything to be soft tissue damage.  While this sounds ""better,"" she still needed exploratory surgery to determine the amount of damage that was actually done.<br/><br/>I left her at the emergency vet at around 11 pm Thursday evening, and received a phone call from them around 2 am, saying that surgery had gone well.  In their surgery, they discovered that all of her abdominal muscles, pelvic floor muscles, and muscles down her one back leg were shredded.  The vet described the way the muscles looked as ""ground hamburger meat"" and said there was nothing to sew back together.  They closed the wounds and sutured her up, and they put in a drain for any fluid to drain.  She got an injectable antibiotic, and was sent home with Tramadol and Metacam for pain.  The vet said they weren't able to tell what the long-term extent of the damage was, due to the fact that vascular (blood vessel) damage could not be determined at the time, and that we just had to wait and see.  They said if she had a lot of tissue dying off due to severe vascular damage, she would need another surgery later on.<br/><br/>She went home at 8 am later that morning (Friday, 8/2), with the advice to keep her on puppy pads and make sure her wounds stayed clean.  Someone local ran out to get puppy pads, and she was given her meds.  </p>

<h3>Dog-Eh Supplements</h3>
<p>Our supplements are born from a place of love for dogs and their health while making it easy and accessible for their human family.​</p>
<p>Our human-grade dog supplements are made in a Canadian manufacturing facility. Not only are our ingredients thoughtfully sourced, but each ingredient is also tested to ensure quality from start to finish. But all of this means nothing if the ingredients break down sitting on a store shelf or in your home. All of our supplements are packaged in an aluminum foil-lined stand-up pouch that stops natural lights from breaking down the ingredients which helps to maintain maximum benefits for your dog. Each package is resealable for ease of use and to maintain maximum freshness.</p>

<h3>The Company</h3>
<p>During a global pandemic when many businesses were closing their doors, Dog-Eh was born. Inspired by their love for dogs and fueled by their passion to serve the dog community, our co-founders saw a need for limited ingredient, human-grade dog supplements. Dog-Eh is a fun, modern, Canadian brand that puts your dog’s health as the central focus for everything we do.​</p>
<p>The co-founders' previous experience in government regulations, sales, dog sports, and business combine to form a truly strong and well-rounded Canadian business union. They created Dog-Eh to make a difference in dogs’ lives with simple, healthy products that are safe and easy to use.​</p>
<p>With only a company logo and some creative posts, Dog-Eh dove headfirst into social media in late 2020 and began to develop a following.  Mystery &amp; intrigue marketing were harnessed to build their social media in anticipation of their product launch on Indiegogo.</p>

<h3>Dog-Eh Cares About the Environment</h3>
<p>Our packages are produced by an industry-leading manufacturer of eco-friendly packaging. They've worked to reduce their waste by 75% and the size of the packaging is optimized to create as little waste as possible.​</p>
<p>By using stand-up pouches for our packaging we're reducing the raw materials and energy needed in our package manufacturing when compared to plastic or glass containers. Stand-up pouches also weigh significantly less meaning less fuel consumption during transportation and they take up less room so fewer vehicles are needed to transport our supplements. Glass and some plastic containers are also more likely to break, which saves potential product waste. From a safety standpoint, we would never want to put your dog at risk of being near broken glass if our packaging took a tumble.</p>

<div><b>It's super Long lasting</b></div>
<div>With the Scents Garden Perfume oils, you no longer have to worry about the fragrance going away before you hit lunch time! There are zero alcohol solvents in our fragrances, which means that the alcohol does not evaporate very fast, taking much of the scent with it. </div>

We bring you pure perfume oils that almost all perfumes, Eau de toilette and colognes have but without the extra alcohol solvents you don't need. Why? (read below)


Its super long lasting as it contains pure perfume oil concentrate
No added alcohol solvents means the fragrance doesn't evaporate fast
You don't have to pay more for what you don't need and you don't waste spraying in the air
You can easily carry it everywhere, on holidays & on the airplane 
It is an awesome self treat &  gift (one less gift to worry about for Christmas) 
We specialize on unisex perfumes so all of them are used and love by men & women alike.

The Differences
The actual carrier of the perfume (scent) comes in an oil form known as the perfume oil and the solvent additive is used to increase the volume of the perfume and sometimes to change the texture for example. This is not necessarily needed, so that's why we offer our customers 100% pure perfume oils at Scents Garden!


(little perfume oil added to the alcohol solvent in mainstream fragrances)

It's super Long lasting
With the Scents Garden Perfume oils, you no longer have to worry about the fragrance going away before you hit lunch time! There are zero alcohol solvents in our fragrances, which means that the alcohol does not evaporate very fast, taking much of the scent with it. 
 

 
Instead, you moisturize your skin with the Scents Garden essential oil based fragrances, and smell fantastic all day, everyday!
 

Don't waste a drop!
Do you know how much fragrance and money you waste when you spray all of that perfumed solvent on your self? isn't it better to not waste a drop and use moisturizing perfume oils as your fragrance instead? They all come with a roller ball or a stick to apply so you don't waste a single drop spraying all over!


 

Easy to carry & Travel friendly
We all want to smell nice all day, on a night out and on a holiday, but who would like to carry a huge bottle in a bag around all day? exactly - nobody. 
Scents Garden perfumes oils come in many carriable sizes, as well as luxury crystal bottle sizes too, so you can choose the most convenient size for you (or get both versions)!
This little pocket size bottle could last for many months:


 
An awesome Collection/gift box
Weather you are treating your self or a friend or family (say for Christmas maybe?), this might just be THE perfect thing to get for them. I mean, when was the last time you got someone a luxurious oil based perfume? talk about unique!

Designed for use in factory settings, they need at least 2 of the same devices to work and offer low accuracy at a high cost. <strong>SafeDistance</strong> is different. We use high speed, precisely timed laser light for better accuracy and have engineered the cost out of the design. Also, since it's light based and completely eye-safe, it's perfect for everyone to use and does not require other devices to function.</div><p> </p><div>

<p style=""margin-left:0px;color: #1a1a1a;"">Since the beginning of this pandemic we have all been practicing better hygiene, wearing masks and keeping our distance from others in public. This has all been designed to keep the virus in check so that it would not overwhelm our hospitals. It helped to limit the spread of the coronavirus initially but now it appears like it's set to make a comeback this fall as we see the case numbers surging all over the world. Despite this, some people have started to become more relaxed at keeping their distance and others don't even bother wearing masks. The virus has not changed of course, and is still just as contagious as before.<br/>At this time COVID-19 is being spread mainly by asymptomatic young adults. Catching the virus can be fatal even for healthy people and may have long term impacts on your health. It is not the flu.</p> <div style=""display: block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width: 80%;"">

The only protection methods proven to be effective are to wear a mask and physically distance yourself from others in public. While wearing a mask is more to protect others from you; the distancing is actually more beneficial to you so that <strong>you</strong> don't catch it.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:0px;color: #1a1a1a;"">We had seen too many places with either no distancing markers in place or having them placed way too close for comfort. So we came up with the idea for <strong>SafeDistance</strong> to help ensure that everyone could maintain their proper recommended physical distance per the CDC guidelines.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:0px;color: #1a1a1a;""><strong>SafeDistance</strong> was designed to be as small and light as possible so that you could carry it with you at all times. It's extremely simple to use - just press the button as you point and it will blink to let you know if you are standing far enough. Like a traffic light, the RED means you are too close (under 1m) and Green means you are okay (over 2m). Yellow is somewhere in between.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:0px;color: #1a1a1a;"">'<a href=""https://tinylidar.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">tinyLiDAR</a>' was the name of a very small maker friendly laser distance sensor we made a few years back. It was based on a low power LiDAR sensor chip originally designed to be used in smart phones. tinyLiDAR turned out to be very popular among robotics clubs, DIY’ers and even some OEMs for quickly adding accurate distance sensing to their microcontroller systems.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:0px;color: #1a1a1a;""><strong>SafeDistance</strong> has been designed to be totally self-contained so there’s no need for an external micro to run it.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:0px;color: #1a1a1a;"">** Most Bluetooth based physical distancing implementations rely on translating the received signal strength indication (RSSI) into distance. Unfortunately, ""<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6211019/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">human body shadowing effects</a>"" can have a dramatic influence on the path loss at 2.4GHz. When adding this uncertainty to the non-uniform radiation patterns of common PIFA/chip antennas and the additional de-tuning caused by close human body proximity, the reported distances can vary considerably no matter how much averaging is done to the RSSI. UWB is less affected by changes in RSSI but its main drawbacks are higher cost of implementation and power consumption.<br/>Considering these shortcomings coupled with the fact that you would need others to carry the same device to make this system work, we opted for a more <i>reliable </i>technology – i.e. <strong>LiDAR</strong>.</p>
</div>
<p style=""margin-left:0px;color: #1a1a1a;"">The LiDAR sensor inside of <strong>SafeDistance</strong> uses a very low power eye-safe, IR LASER to accurately measure the distance to the target. It’s a field proven technology and is currently in use in millions of smartphones around the world today. See below for details of this Time-of-Flight technology.</p>

 Most other distancing devices on the market use either Ultra-wideband (UWB) or Bluetooth radios. Designed for use in factory settings, they need at least 2 of the same devices to work and offer low accuracy at a high cost. SafeDistance is different. We use high speed, precisely timed laser light for better accuracy and have engineered the cost out of the design. Also, since it's light based and completely eye-safe, it's perfect for everyone to use and does not require other devices to function. 
Why?
Since the beginning of this pandemic we have all been practicing better hygiene, wearing masks and keeping our distance from others in public. This has all been designed to keep the virus in check so that it would not overwhelm our hospitals. It helped to limit the spread of the coronavirus initially but now it appears like it's set to make a comeback this fall as we see the case numbers surging all over the world. Despite this, some people have started to become more relaxed at keeping their distance and others don't even bother wearing masks. The virus has not changed of course, and is still just as contagious as before.At this time COVID-19 is being spread mainly by asymptomatic young adults. Catching the virus can be fatal even for healthy people and may have long term impacts on your health. It is not the flu. 
""complications associated with COVID-19 can include Blood clots in the veins and arteries of the lungs, heart, legs or brain Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C)www.cdc.gov

A vaccine for the coronavirus is still in development and may not be available until sometime next year. The only protection methods proven to be effective are to wear a mask and physically distance yourself from others in public. While wearing a mask is more to protect others from you; the distancing is actually more beneficial to you so that you don't catch it.
 

""Spread happens when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks, and droplets from their mouth or nose are launched into the air and land in the mouths or noses of people nearby. The droplets can also be inhaled into the lungs. Recent studies indicate that people who are infected but do not have symptoms likely also play a role in the spread of COVID-19. www.cdc.gov


 
We had seen too many places with either no distancing markers in place or having them placed way too close for comfort. So we came up with the idea for SafeDistance to help ensure that everyone could maintain their proper recommended physical distance per the CDC guidelines.
SafeDistance was designed to be as small and light as possible so that you could carry it with you at all times. It's extremely simple to use - just press the button as you point and it will blink to let you know if you are standing far enough. Like a traffic light, the RED means you are too close (under 1m) and Green means you are okay (over 2m). Yellow is somewhere in between.
 

 

We have been working diligently on SafeDistance for the last two months and have been successful in bringing it to a production ready state. We have also been certified by Arrow Electronics. Your help is needed now to allow us to go to mass production.
Join us to help make SafeDistance a reality. With your pledge we can make it generally available at a low cost so that everyone can benefit from this practical new tool to help fight the coronavirus.
Thank you!Dinesh

tiny What?
'tinyLiDAR' was the name of a very small maker friendly laser distance sensor we made a few years back. It was based on a low power LiDAR sensor chip originally designed to be used in smart phones. tinyLiDAR turned out to be very popular among robotics clubs, DIY’ers and even some OEMs for quickly adding accurate distance sensing to their microcontroller systems.
SafeDistance has been designed to be totally self-contained so there’s no need for an external micro to run it.
 Specs
Dimensions: 2.1 x 1.5 x 0.4inchesApprox Weight: 0.5oz (15g) including battery
 

Why LiDAR?

** Most Bluetooth based physical distancing implementations rely on translating the received signal strength indication (RSSI) into distance. Unfortunately, ""human body shadowing effects"" can have a dramatic influence on the path loss at 2.4GHz. When adding this uncertainty to the non-uniform radiation patterns of common PIFA/chip antennas and the additional de-tuning caused by close human body proximity, the reported distances can vary considerably no matter how much averaging is done to the RSSI. UWB is less affected by changes in RSSI but its main drawbacks are higher cost of implementation and power consumption.Considering these shortcomings coupled with the fact that you would need others to carry the same device to make this system work, we opted for a more reliable technology – i.e. LiDAR.

The LiDAR sensor inside of SafeDistance uses a very low power eye-safe, IR LASER to accurately measure the distance to the target. It’s a field proven technology and is currently in use in millions of smartphones around the world today. See below for details of this Time-of-Flight technology.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We started to develop idea of the versatile shoes in 2013. It begins just as prototyping hobby result, but some works ago we decided that it could be somethitg more... like a new cultural fenomenum.</p>
<p>We - are a two architects: Sam Bolotnik and Ruslan Antonenko. Age 28/29. Born in Karaganda, Kazakhstan. Now starting our campaign from city Krasnoyarsk, Russia.</p>
<p>During the campaign and later we will answer your questions.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Goal of this campaign is fixed. And it's rather serious - 370000$. That's all because we supposed to do really useful, safe and comfortable device. For this aims we'll  need support of professional shoes/skates developers with design of upper part of boots, we'll also need more tests of a final product - it would be nearly 100 crushed pairs or more to make every next better.</p>
<p>The good news is - the price of Olooo in this campaign is 15-25% lower than it will be after official release (planned on March 2019). Cause we don't have any marketing spends here.<br/>Another good news: our backers will get Olooo sneakers at least 3-4 weeks earlier than official release.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We like to imagine how people skateing in Olooo... They leave the house, switch to skating mode and go to the store, office, school, university, cinema, cafe, club ... on the way using the bus, taxi, metro, going up/down on the escalator, passing through turnstiles. And all of this with one pair of shoes! Do not need these long re-training every time and a heavy backpack.<br/>Imagine how much people can change their lifestyle with Olooo! Without exaggeration...</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our main risk is the desire to launch sales as quickly as possible and to fail to conduct enough tests. Understanding this will prevent such impulses and prevent the model from entering into final production before it is really ready.</p>
<p>Technical risks of being flimsy in skate mode and being stiff in walking mode are solvded on early  prototyping stage:</p>

<h3>Organic skincare, made in Italy</h3>
<p>It is very important to take care of what we eat and only choose the best high quality, organic ingredients for our diet. But what we put on our skin is equally important as ingredients are absorbed and enter the bloodstream.</p>
<p>Stress, lack of sleep, excessive anxiety does show on your skin, and does not contribute to your general health: detox and relaxation can help you reenergize and start the day with a good mood. Can the natural perfume of an organic skincare product do that? Taking care of your self with amazing products can really help your general wellbeing.We would like you to take care of your skin and take that moment for yourself when you receive our box, as a real treat.</p>
<p>Our boxes <strong>only include certified eco-friendly, organic products</strong>, that contain <strong>NO</strong> PEGs, parabens, petrolatum, paraffin, SLSs, SLES, silicones or artificial colours. We really like products that contain ingredients from biodynamic organic agriculture, that follow organic standards and farming techniques that respect the earth, supporting its natural processes. They are also nickel tested, to protect consumers from allergies and intolerances, and they are cruelty-free.</p>
<p><strong>The most important part is what they DO contain: the highest quality ingredients, and that is something you will feel immediately on your skin. </strong></p>
<p>Our boxes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sent<strong> Bimonthly</strong>. We choose to send a <strong>bimonthly subscription (1 box every 2 months)</strong> to avoid overwhelming you with too many products a month. Shipping fewer parcels also reduce the carbon footprint and make it less expensive to ship worldwide. </li>
<li>
<strong>Essentials</strong>. Our face skincare box contains every time a complete routine for your skin. We would like to <strong>make sure you have got the essential products for your skin</strong>. That is why we always include: face cream, face mask, face cleaner, of different brands but always of huge value, plus of course accessories, oils, scrubs, balms, serums etc.</li>
<li>
<strong>Minimal</strong>. Every box will have lots of surprises and lots of sample size products to test over the months. But <strong>we promise to never fill your drawers</strong> of products that you won't ever need or won't be able to use. </li>
</ul>
<p>The challenge for green skincare is to create the best eco-conscious sustainable products in a convenient, comfortable format. Lots of research is needed to get <strong>the best products formulated just the right way, to be effective, high quality and a pleasure to use every day</strong>. These are the kind of products we like to include in our selection.</p>
<h3>Kleverpark</h3>
<p>As an Italian expat, over time I realized that the wonderful Mediterranean <strong>made in Italy skincare</strong> is not very well known abroad and I think certified organic Italian skincare deserves a lot more attention.  The quality of the products and the ingredients used are very often way superior to the ingredients of organic products from internationally recognized brands.</p>
<p>I founded a little company in the Netherlands to change that perception. With our subscription boxes, we would like to source Italian products and give a chance to skincare lovers everywhere to discover many little gems.</p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>The box is called Kleverpark, which is an amazing area where we are based, a fairytale little town, very close to the splendors of the city of Amsterdam. Living here allows us to see Italian products from another point of view, and to love them even more. </span></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our project</h3>
<ul>
<li>We are ready to start selling our lovely boxes, all the background work of research and network has been done already. We plan to start selling the memberships to finance the logistics of the subscription model. </li>
<li>While we will always try to keep prices accessible, the membership prices will increase next year. If you subscribe now, you also get to <strong>lock in your founder membership price for life</strong>, so even when we will increase the prices, you will be able to continue to renew your membership at the current rate. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Two memberships boxes</h3>
<p>We offer two levels of memberships, one with masks exclusively, and one with a complete facial routine. All from the most amazing organic Italian brands. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Masks subscription box</strong>. Sent every 2 months, contains 7 sheet masks or single-use masks.</li>
<li>
<strong>Face skincare subscription box</strong>. Sent every 2 months, it contains  7-8 full-size products, and some extra sample size products. Everything you need to upgrade your natural routine. </li>
</ul>
<p>Who are the products for? We will send products for normal to sensitive skin, dry or oily, and the products will follow the seasons and provide what you need most (more nourishment in winter, sunscreen products in summer, and so on).</p>
<p>Every box will follow a theme, to inspire you to take care of yourself and stop every day for a second from your busy daily routine, smell the amazing scents changing with the season. </p>
