She has two loving parents in Rob and Marla, as well as older siblings Nick and Kenzie. Hayley has taken very ill the past few months, and last week Nationwide Children's Hospital admitted her into the Rheumatology wing for extensive testing. She looks to be diagnosed with an autoimmune disease, which will remain with her for the rest of her life. The initial treatment requires around 36 months of medication and restrictive diets. Thereafter, the disease hopefully goes into remission, provided she maintains a strict diet for the rest of her life. As a result of the severity of this illness, she will be in the hospital for at least the next couple of weeks, recieving testing and hopefully beginning treatment as soon as possible. Of course, the family will spare no expense in this process. With the life of a family member at stake, who wouldn't? Nevertheless, Rob and Marla will be facing enormous medical bills, between CT scans, overnight hospital stays, and day-to-day testing. This campaign directly addresses that issue.

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Nuvitrin is a patented oral diet spray that gives you natural feeling of fullness which leads to less food intakes, thus healthy and safe weight management. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">It was first researched and developed by a medical doctor, Yeonjung Ryu, who specialised in obesity and ran obesity clinic for more than 20 years. After having seen countless obese patients who suffer from physical and psychological side-effects of extreme diets, she decided to come up with a solution that is healthy and safe for anyone to use.</p>
<p style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">So she invented an innovative recipe, perfect for anyone who is weight conscious and wants to manage weight without having to consume any kinds of drug substances that may work against your body's natural mechanisms that forcefully suppress appetite. </p>
<p style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Along with other severe physical damages to your health, depression and nutrient deficiencies are very common side-effects of weight loss. But because Nuvitrin does not encourage you to consciously cut down on what you eat and how much you eat, you won't experience the same stress that you'd normally go through when you're trying to lose weight the traditional way which is the ultimate starting point for all kinds of physical and emotional side-effects.</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Nuvitrin is made of FDA-approved ingredients such as olive extract, peppermint, guarana, honey and vitamins.

</ul>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">When Nuvitrin is sprayed in your mouth, its ingredients will bind with your taste buds which will acknowledge your body that food is being consumed and so satiety signal will be activated. By the time you start eating your normal meals (5 minutes after 2~3 oral spritzes) your body will have developed sense of fullness which means you will naturally eat less than how much you normally eat without having to force yourself to put down the folk and knife, feeling stressed! </span></p>
<p></p>
<p>Because digestive system is activated when Nuvitrin is sprayed orally and its ingredients bind with your taste buds, your body spends more energy running that mechanism than the amount of calories you consume, you will naturally burn more energy - thus weight loss!</p>

<h3></h3>
<p> Hi my name is Kristy Lockhart and my best friend was diagnosed with Lyme Disease in 2012 after being misdiagnosed for many years. It took her years and at least 100 doctors/hospital/specialist appointments and visits to finally receive a proper diagnosis. </p>
<p>In March 2014 Heather was 50% better in beating lyme, this has to do with her amazing lyme doctor &amp; her extraordinary chiropractor and naturopath team &amp; her own strength.  Heather was on same antibiotics for 18 months, she got bit by ‘something’ weeks ago, ever since then she went from being 50% better to only 10% better with 80% of her previous lyme symptoms returning.  She was bit by an unknown bug in late march which caused her ankle to turn red and swell double it’s size, insane itch, she wasn’t able to walk and I took her to the hospital emergency 3 times in one week to get no help, no referrals, nothing. For the last 6 months there was so much improvement, so much hope and light, and now, to be perfectly honesty, we are scared. Physically and neurologically it is as if Heather’s state is as it was before we even started lyme treatment back in September 2012.  I have to help her wash her hair, I have to prepare all of her meals, do her laundry and dishes as her joints are swollen, painful and inflamed and she can’t do the things she normally did for the last 6 months as this new ‘infection’ is making all symptoms return that were seemingly gone.  We have made an emergency appointment to go back to her lyme doctor only a month after seeing her, as everything we were doing (medication/supplement/etc wise) is no longer working.  So far, in 2014 Heather has gotten shingles 3 times &amp; is currently trying to recover from them again. Her immune system is compromised and this is the cause of them recurring.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/796768/files/20140818182807-1.jpg?1408411687"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Thank you to heather’s loving online family, on redbubble and face book, to her friends and even strangers that have donated in the past, shared this link, and supported her with love, kindness and patience and unconditional love during her journey. I couldn’t have helped heather go this far without all of you beautiful souls, and I don’t know what we would do without you. It’s a scary time, Heather likes to put on a brave face, but I myself am not only her best friend, but caregiver and have been watching her rapidly decline over the last few weeks. I need your help now more than ever.</p>
<p>If you know you were bitten by a tick and seek immediate treatment in Canada you go on antibiotics for a few weeks and you’re cured. If you didn’t know you were bit by a tick the tick not only infects you with a devastating bacteria, but it lays its eggs in your body which hatch in 18 days. Heather went almost 4 years in extreme physical pain, I watched her mind and body deteriorate in the most devastating way. Going to every medical appointment, ambulance ride, neurosurgeon, MRI, family dr visit and never getting an answer, having it all blamed on her ‘anxiety’ I decided to take matters into my own hands and researched full time, it was months of extensive research that all signs and symptoms pointed to lyme disease.  In Canada treatment beyond a month is NOT available. Chronic lyme is not treated in Canada, and the few doctors who have done so, have lost their license.  This is why we have to travel to the USA every 3 months for treatment and expensive antibiotics which are not covered.</p>
<p>The majority of people with Lyme disease are misdiagnosed for years and by the time it is discovered it is almost too late</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/796771/files/20140818182855-2.jpg?1408411735"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In 2009 Heather had a gym membership, walked 5 miles a day, hiked, spent time in nature, and constantly doing photo shoots. Now, she can't walk more than 20 minutes, becomes so fatigued far too quickly, has difficulty breathing, chest pains, migraines, her joints swell up so bad she can't write or type, difficulty folding laundry, doing dishes and playing with her cat. Something in her body is malfunctioning as her entire body is covered in edema.</p>
<p>This woman means everything to me. I can't put into words how I love her. She is an amazing artist/photographer (<a href=""http://www.locustgirl.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>www.locustgirl.com</u></a><a href=""http://www.redbubble.com/people/locustgirl"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>www.redbubble.com/people/locustgirl</u></a>) and a genuine pure soul and there's nothing I won't do for her. Meeting someone like this only happens once in a lifetime, and I fear her lifetime will be over soon if her medical treatment is unable to continue.</p>

</div></div>","Hi my name is Kristy Lockhart and my best friend was diagnosed with Lyme Disease in 2012 after being misdiagnosed for many years. It took her years and at least 100 doctors/hospital/specialist appointments and visits to finally receive a proper diagnosis. 
In March 2014 Heather was 50% better in beating lyme, this has to do with her amazing lyme doctor & her extraordinary chiropractor and naturopath team & her own strength.  Heather was on same antibiotics for 18 months, she got bit by ‘something’ weeks ago, ever since then she went from being 50% better to only 10% better with 80% of her previous lyme symptoms returning.  She was bit by an unknown bug in late march which caused her ankle to turn red and swell double it’s size, insane itch, she wasn’t able to walk and I took her to the hospital emergency 3 times in one week to get no help, no referrals, nothing. For the last 6 months there was so much improvement, so much hope and light, and now, to be perfectly honesty, we are scared. Physically and neurologically it is as if Heather’s state is as it was before we even started lyme treatment back in September 2012.  I have to help her wash her hair, I have to prepare all of her meals, do her laundry and dishes as her joints are swollen, painful and inflamed and she can’t do the things she normally did for the last 6 months as this new ‘infection’ is making all symptoms return that were seemingly gone.  We have made an emergency appointment to go back to her lyme doctor only a month after seeing her, as everything we were doing (medication/supplement/etc wise) is no longer working.  So far, in 2014 Heather has gotten shingles 3 times & is currently trying to recover from them again. Her immune system is compromised and this is the cause of them recurring.


Thank you to heather’s loving online family, on redbubble and face book, to her friends and even strangers that have donated in the past, shared this link, and supported her with love, kindness and patience and unconditional love during her journey. I couldn’t have helped heather go this far without all of you beautiful souls, and I don’t know what we would do without you. It’s a scary time, Heather likes to put on a brave face, but I myself am not only her best friend, but caregiver and have been watching her rapidly decline over the last few weeks. I need your help now more than ever.
If you know you were bitten by a tick and seek immediate treatment in Canada you go on antibiotics for a few weeks and you’re cured. If you didn’t know you were bit by a tick the tick not only infects you with a devastating bacteria, but it lays its eggs in your body which hatch in 18 days. Heather went almost 4 years in extreme physical pain, I watched her mind and body deteriorate in the most devastating way. Going to every medical appointment, ambulance ride, neurosurgeon, MRI, family dr visit and never getting an answer, having it all blamed on her ‘anxiety’ I decided to take matters into my own hands and researched full time, it was months of extensive research that all signs and symptoms pointed to lyme disease.  In Canada treatment beyond a month is NOT available. Chronic lyme is not treated in Canada, and the few doctors who have done so, have lost their license.  This is why we have to travel to the USA every 3 months for treatment and expensive antibiotics which are not covered.
The majority of people with Lyme disease are misdiagnosed for years and by the time it is discovered it is almost too late

In 2009 Heather had a gym membership, walked 5 miles a day, hiked, spent time in nature, and constantly doing photo shoots. Now, she can't walk more than 20 minutes, becomes so fatigued far too quickly, has difficulty breathing, chest pains, migraines, her joints swell up so bad she can't write or type, difficulty folding laundry, doing dishes and playing with her cat. Something in her body is malfunctioning as her entire body is covered in edema.
This woman means everything to me. I can't put into words how I love her. She is an amazing artist/photographer (www.locustgirl.comwww.redbubble.com/people/locustgirl) and a genuine pure soul and there's nothing I won't do for her. Meeting someone like this only happens once in a lifetime, and I fear her lifetime will be over soon if her medical treatment is unable to continue.
Donating to this campaign will ensure proper medical care and treatment and lodging while undergoing this care. It doesn't matter if it's $1 or $1000 every little bit helps. Even if you have no $ to donate, please will you post this on various social networking tools to spread the word?
Even while ill, both she and I helped out with other fundraisers (Rideau Valley Wildlife Sanctuary) by donating hundreds of dollars worth of her art to be sold to help treat injured wildlife. She went to college to learn how to take care of the disabled, now she is disabled.

On a happier note, Heather got to spend time with her favorite wild snowy owl this year, snowy momma goddess and this owl was/is the reason why Heather continues to have hope/fight, as 3.5 yrs ago she had lyme and no one would help/diagnose her, and meeting this owl, watching this owl survive and brave the cold ALONE is what motivated Heather to change her life for the better, mentally and emotionally.
-if you look under the tab ‘gallery’ you will see photographs of this beautiful owl and many other wildlife photos that we are offering as a perk, our gift to you for donating.
Please check out her wildlife photography as they will make you fall even deeper in love with wildlife.  Heather (when she is able to go out) has this deep soulful connection with animals and it clearly shows in her photography.

She left home at 15 and she has no blood relatives who can help her, and she hasn't worked for years due to being so ill. I am a single woman and the ONLY person who has been helping her for years, please can you help me help her? 

Any questions or for a list of the prints you would like, please email me here lockhart_ottawa@hotmail.com
I promise you if you were to meet Heather you would love her almost as much as I do. I have never met another soul with such an enormous loving heart as hers. Please helps us

Kristy

<p><b>Why this matters</b></p>
<p>The better we understand people’s experiences
with the health system, the more we can improve health care. Policy makers are
often far removed from the realities of giving and receiving care, and might not
know the human consequences – both good and bad – of their decisions. Patients
who use the health care system can benefit from sharing their experiences. Those
who provide care can learn a lot from patients’ perspectives and from fellow
health worker’s experiences.</p>
<p>Everyone will interact with the health care
system at some point in his or her life.  In TV medical dramas, we often see heroics and
extremes of situations. But there are important and real stories that happen
every day that are not being told or shared. These stories are at times raw and
angry, but also grateful, compassionate, funny and sad. They provide
a window into the human side of health care.</p>

<h3>LONDON, ENGLAND (UNITED KINGDOM)</h3>
<h3>Rione Holder is 5 years old. He also goes by the name of Pooh Bear. Unfortunately he

<h3>Gravity Centered Golf clubs are designed to eliminate torque and produce straighter shots. More balls in the fairway and more manageable play out of the rough make golf more fun!</h3>
<p><strong>Introducing a new paradigm in golf club design-clubs designed to hit the ball straight!</strong></p>
<p>Part of the fascination of golf is that it is a nice balance of not too easy and not too hard. The most interesting courses have the most interesting challenges. If the carry over the water was really short, there would be no feeling of satisfaction to getting over safely. If it was too hard.. but you know what I mean.</p>
<p>What is frustrating is the difficulty built into today's clubs.  They are a big improvement over the ones used by Mary, Queen of Scots, and even the ones used by Bobby Jones, but there's work yet to be done.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Jones Problems: </strong><strong>The three killer defects he overcame</strong></p>
<p>Jones and his contemporaries managed to play brilliant golf with equipment that had three major built-in defects which made hitting the ball straight a real challenge.</p>
<p>1. The centrifugal force of the swing caused the wooden shafts of his time to twist  making a reproducible swing difficult.</p>
<p>2. The golf balls of the Jones era were aerodynamically unstable.</p>
<p>3. Joining the shaft to the edge of the clubhead causes a rotational force called torque which takes the ball away from its intended path. Shots out of the rough  are particularly troubling where the grass amplifies the torque effect.  </p>
<p>Fortunately for most of todays golfers, steel and graphite have reduced the bending and eliminated the twisting problems of the old wooden shaft. Todays golf balls are so much better balanced and aerodynamically sound that it takes a Bubba or a Tiger to shape trajectories. The one major design defect that still remains from the Bobby Jones era is the torque caused by attaching the shaft an inch or more away from where the ball will be struck.</p>
<p>         This remaining defect is what is eliminated with “zero torque “ golf clubs.    </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mefbfwtHGg1rliqwso1_1280.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>A Little History of Golf Club Design Evolution </strong></p>
<p>Current golf club design principles originated in the early 1800's. The asymmetrical design produced by attaching the shaft to a corner of the club head produces an inherent torque around the attachment point.The result is that it is easy to hit the ball far but difficult to hit it straight. We think the time for change is long past due. </p>
<p>  Our design moves the shaft attachment point so that zero torque is produced, resulting in more shots in the fairway, and makes it far easier to hit straight from difficult lies. <strong> </strong></p>
<p><img alt=""The design behind our gravity centered clubs"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mdydxe7dtB1rliqwso1_400.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>Golfers respect tradition and change comes slowly, but in recent years the design of putters has moved gradually from the ancient blade putter towards more common sense designs which attach the shaft closer to the impact point on the face, reducing torque.<strong> </strong>The next logical move is to eliminate the torque from the other clubs as well. That's exactly what we have done.</p>
<p><strong>Tom Watson's Advice</strong></p>
<p>The great golfer Tom Watson, winner of many Majors, once suggested that when golfers play their next round, they should try picking up the ball after every shot off the fairway, placing it back in the fairway and playing from there. He was making the point that game is a lot easier and more fun if you play from the fairway and hit the ball straight. Imagine how much lower your score might be and how much more fun you might have if you consistently hit the ball straighter and hit the fairway more. This is exactly what Zero Torque clubs will help you do. </p>
<p><strong>Market Research and Club Testing</strong></p>
<p>Bob Lansdowne and Associates, a market research firm in Pinehursrt, North Carolina did some consumer testing for us last spring. They tested our clubs using amateurs as well as professionals from different country clubs in the area. When asked what the most important feature for them when buying a driver, 71% said accuracy and 29% said distance.</p>
<p>Our driver has over 30% less dispersion down the fairway than standard drivers without losing any distance. We know this because we tested our clubs with Golf Laboratories (<a href=""http://www.golflabs.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.golflabs.com</a>), the top golf testing facility in the United States. According to them, our clubs had the best first generation tests compared to any other clubs that have been tested there. </p>
<p><strong>Early bird pricing. All contribution amounts are based on pre-manufacturing orders for these clubs.</strong><strong> Prices will go up an estimated 20% or more once in full production. All Zero Torque clubs are made of the same high tech material used by major manufacturers.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Drivers have titanium heads, graphite shafts. Three wood, five wood and hybrids have stainless steel heads and grahite shafts.All clubs have Wynn-Tac Sta-dry grips.</strong></p>
<p>Zero torque clubs are not manufactured until customer orders are received.The picture below shows the Zero Torque driver you will receive if you check off the sidebar contribution of $129. Next to it is a major manufacturer's driver which costs almost three times as much.</p>
<p>Let 's say you really need  a straight drive on the next hole, the one with the creek up one side and trees down the other.  Which design just shouts out ""let's hit this ball in the fairway?""</p>
<p>Not too much to think about is there?</p>

<p>We are now working with the second generation design and have had prototype clubs tested. We know they perform. In order to introduce them widely to golfers we plan to demonstrate them at the PGA annual merchandise show (<a href=""http://www.pgashow.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.pgashow.com</a>). It will take $20,000 to complete the latest design modifications to some of the clubs, and to stock inventory, and rent display and range test spaces at the merchandise show.  </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>A great gift idea.  </strong></p>
<p>Even if you are not a golfer yourself a Zero Torque golf club is a memorable gift for special occasions, birthdays, promotions or holidays. If you order before December 20 a special Christmas gift card will be sent to the lucky recipient. If later, a regular gift notification will be sent. </p>
<p>Your lucky golfer friend will understand instantly what you have given. Straight shots and better golf scores.</p>
<p><strong>Corporate Gifts </strong></p>
<p><strong>Want to give a gift to your best customers, or perhaps a memento of a Campaign Kick Off ?  Why not something memorable, that they can get nowhere else? The fountain pens and T shirts are great, but the Zero Torque golf clubs will be with them on every fairway for a long time.</strong></p>

<p>We will also include a note suggesting the recipient should not swing these clubs too freely in the house. Spring is on the way as usual. Be patient.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>A final note:</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong>Thirty years ago the introduction of large head tennis racquets changed that game forever. They looked a little different but they made the game more fun for more people and raised the standard of play for everyone. Clubs that hit the ball straighter will do the same thing for golf. Zero Torque golf clubs because in golf, <strong>""Nothing  beats straight"" </strong></p>
<p><strong>Thanks. For watching our video. For thinking about the next ,needed, revolution in golf club design. For telling your friends what a great idea you think this is.</strong> (You were planning to tell them , weren't you?)<strong> Thanks for helping take a big step towards making golf a lot more fun for a lot more people.</strong> </p>

Want to give a gift to your best customers, or perhaps a memento of a Campaign Kick Off ?  Why not something memorable, that they can get nowhere else? The fountain pens and T shirts are great, but the Zero Torque golf clubs will be with them on every fairway for a long time.
 

 
We will also include a note suggesting the recipient should not swing these clubs too freely in the house. Spring is on the way as usual. Be patient.
 
A final note:
Thirty years ago the introduction of large head tennis racquets changed that game forever. They looked a little different but they made the game more fun for more people and raised the standard of play for everyone. Clubs that hit the ball straighter will do the same thing for golf. Zero Torque golf clubs because in golf, ""Nothing  beats straight"" 
Thanks. For watching our video. For thinking about the next ,needed, revolution in golf club design. For telling your friends what a great idea you think this is. (You were planning to tell them , weren't you?) Thanks for helping take a big step towards making golf a lot more fun for a lot more people.

You okay with that?!Beta Version of a Core-Controlled Stealth Mobile GameWe're starting simple and fun but there is no end to the complexity we can inject into these games together. Be a part of helping us build and test games by backing our project so we can bring a whole new level of play to the gym.Stealth’s mini-games are designed to never play out the same way, so you'll always be in store for something new and exciting. The unlimited number of gameplay combinations keeps your mind and your core guessing -- leading to muscle confusion and improved results!How Does Stealth Work?Stealth carefully calibrates with your phone’s motion detector to recognize every movement you make. It then translates those movements into gameplay actions on the screen of your smartphone. Other games use motion controls but never before has any game been designed to mirror core training movements that hit 29 different muscles. Stealth truly is the beginning of a new era of virtual reality. The decisions and moves you make to improve in the game will result in lasting results in your real life training progress.How much does the first stealth game cost? The Stealth app is completely free to download and will come with at least 1 game. It might even come with more than that if we reach a few of our stretch goals together! So, as soon as you tear off Stealth's packaging, you'll be able to immerse yourself in core training gameplay right away!No elaborate setup required. Just open your stealth app, place your phone into the designated slot, and you are good to go. Stealth Uses All Available DimensionsYour core includes many more muscle groups than just your abs. Although tons of our movements focus on the rectus abdominis (the muscles in your belly area) others will blast key areas of your core such as your obliques and lower back. With Stealth's unique, fluid design, you'll have no limitations on your gameplay or training freedom.Stealth’s games will have you twisting, turning and rotating 360 degrees to earn high scores; both in the game and with your physique.The ability to move forward and backward and side to side is great but we are in the business of pushing the boundaries here! That's why Stealth games will also have you moving your body laterally, hitting parts of your core that few other ab trainers even reach. With Stealth's 360 degree freedom there will never be any limitation on your gameplay or workout.This huge degree of movement fluidity is part of what makes Stealth such an effective core trainer. You’ll just feel like you’re playing games but you’ll actually be performing sophisticated core training movements that leave no muscle group behind. You just focus on collecting all those in-game upgrades and let Stealth work its super-smart core training magic.Stealth BenefitsWe all know that exercise is a key part of optimal health. But, who hasn't had trouble sticking to a regular exercise regime from time to time? Truth is, the biggest benefits from working out come from consistency and adherence to a program. The unique twist Stealth brings to exercise makes it the easiest program to stick to ever.Have you ever come up with some half-baked excuse to get out of playing games with your buddies like you do to avoid going to the gym? Of course not! With Stealth, you'll be looking forward to every single workout so consistency will come automatically. By sticking to the Stealth program you'll enjoy the following benefits:  How Should I use Stealth?Just like good old Tetris and every well-designed game since, Stealth's games feature appropriate intensity settings for everyone. Stealth is great for core training novices and hardcore ab junkies alike.No lifestyle these days is quite the same, so everyone fits in their workouts in different ways. Are you just starting out when it comes to core training? Try using Stealth in the privacy of your own home to get your workout in bright and early. A morning Stealth gaming session will get your mind and body energized for the day!In contrast, maybe you're a seasoned core training veteran looking for a new challenge to break through those plateaus? Perfect! Stealth is ready to bring it! Simply turn up the dial on the intensity levels of Stealth's games and it will throw everything but the kitchen sink at you. With Stealth's unpredictability and movement fluidity you'll feel the burn regardless of your intensity levels and be crushing your plateaus in no time.Regardless of your intensity preferences, there is really no limitation on how or where you can use Stealth. Stealth comes fully assembled and is easy to bring anywhere so you can hit your core and get your game on anytime, anywhere.Don't forget to get your partner in on the core training action! Grinding it out at the gym and counting out reps together can get old pretty quickly. That's why Stealth helps add some excitement to your training sessions together. What's Stealth Made Of?At Stealth, we've put tons of work into our product design to create a platform capable of keeping up with the intense gameplay action of the Stealth app while maximizing workout comfort. Careful thought was put into the balance and angles of Stealth's movement to ensure it feels natural and comfortable. Stealth also features an antibacterial, sweat-resistant padding so you can hold your plank all day without feeling the slightest bit uncomfortable.Stealth's design is completely unique and gives it its signature range of motion. By joining the Stealth movement you'll be supporting revolutionary software and engineering all at once!",21.0,0,"1 Campaign

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a="""">My father, Allen Schrock was not in the best of health, but he was self-sufficient enough to take care of himself.  One day in March of 2015 he fell and spent 24 hours on the floor before he was found.<br/><br/><p>In that time his body literally started breaking down to the point that his doctors only gave him a 33% chance of surviving.  He did survive, but his quality of life is a fraction of what it was before the fall.</p><p>I am creating the Allen Band (named after my father) to help families get their aging parents and grandparents the help the need as quickly as possible when they fall or need assistance.  If I would have found my father in four hours instead of 24 hours, I could have prevented much of his tissue damage and he would still be enjoying a good quality of life.</p><p><strong>What Exactly is the Allen Band?</strong></p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FoUB2hWOeQ0w%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DoUB2hWOeQ0w%26feature%3Dyoutu.be&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FoUB2hWOeQ0w%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/>The Allen Band is a slim, stylish band that monitors a senior's heart rate, body temperature and mobility.  It sends automated alerts to family members (we call them Caregivers) if something is wrong or the wearer needs help.  It is very much like Life Alert but without any monthly monitoring fees whatsoever.<p></p><p>Most devices like LifeAlert and MedicalAlert provide users with free hardware up front, but then saddle users with $41.95/month multi-year contracts for monitoring.   A typical senior will spend over $7,500 in monitoring expenses alone while using a Life Alert system over a 15 year period.</p><p>The Idea behind the Allen Band is that the user pays a one-time cost (estimated at $399) for the Allen Band, and receives free monitoring services for life. The Allen Band can provide families with superior, personalized monitoring options while allowing seniors to stay at home where they want to be.</p><p><strong>Free Monitoring for Life</strong></p><p>Free monitoring may seem too good to be true, but with today’s technology it is easily achievable. All of the current major senior monitoring systems rely on a pendant / base system that links the user directly to a live monitoring call center. These monitoring centers are extremely expensive to operate and are the driving expense behind existing cost-prohibitive monitoring devices.</p><p>The Allen Band is different. Rather than routing emergency events to a call center, the Allen Band uses the Internet to directly notify family, friends, or even neighbors that mom or dad needs help.</p><p>When a loved one falls, is inactive for an extended period of time, or experiences an event that is detected by the Allen Band, the band will ask the senior user if they are OK. If the senior user presses the OK button no alert is sent to family.  If the SOS button is pressed instead, a text message, email, and/or push notification is sent to the seniors’ caregivers letting them know what happened and that help is needed.</p><p></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446293371/nwpj7eboiqjislbwnhzr.png"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p><strong>More than Just an SOS Button</strong><br/><p></p><br/>The Allen Band does offer senior users the ability to signal for help by double-pressing the SOS button, but it is more than just a panic button. The Allen Band uses the latest 21st century technology to measure specific biometric readings. The Allen Band can measure:<br/><br/><ul>
<li>Heart Rate</li>
<li>Body Temperature (is there a fever or hypothermic state)</li>
<li>Sudden Falls</li>
<li>Lack of Motion Over an Extended Period</li>
<li>Connectivity Issues (No communication from the Allen Band)</li>
<li>Battery Status Issues (when battery is low, Caregiver is alerted)</li>
<li>GPS Location (using phone's location services)<br/> </li>
</ul><p>All of this data is sent to the monitoring cloud at regular intervals and each caregiver can ask the cloud monitoring system to alert them based on their own levels of concern.</p><p>This eliminates the need for a call center to monitor each user, eliminating the monitoring costs. Each Allen Band can send alerts to up to 2 Caregivers at no cost whatsoever.</p><p>Additional Caregivers can be added for $1.00 per month per Caregiver. The Caregiver, not the senior user, pays the $1.00 monthly monitoring charge to be added to the account. We use these small $1.00 payments to cover the cloud server monitoring expenses.</p><p><strong>Monitoring Options That are as Mobile as You Are</strong></p><p>Unlike traditional pendant / base monitoring solutions, the Allen band will communicate with the cloud over WiFi or via a Bluetooth connected smartphone. That means your Allen Band can monitor your loved ones at home or on the go.</p><p>If a senior suffers a fall or needs to quickly and easily ask for help, a double button press on the Allen Band immediately alerts Caregivers to the need.  The Allen Band pulls the senior's GPS location from their smartphone and includes with the alert so Caregivers know where to send help.<br/></p><p><strong>Stylish and Discrete</strong></p><p>We conducted over 100 interviews with seniors who have used or considered using the pendant / base monitoring systems.</p><p>The leading consideration in a senior user’s decision to use an existing system was the monthly cost of monitoring followed closely by the stigma that is associated with the large and ugly wearable pendants.</p><p>One respondent said she wouldn’t use a LifeAlert system even if she needed it because it was like “wearing a giant I am infirm"" sign around her neck. Another stated that she was 63 years old and probably needed a pendant but wouldn’t wear it because “it just isn’t cool.”</p><p>The Allen Band will be designed to look like a slim fitness tracker. It even tells time! No one but the senior user and his/her caregivers will know that the Allen Band is hard at work. That is the way it should be.</p><p><b>Why Indiegogo?</b></p><p>Myself and my team of 15 employees at Schrock Innovations have successfully developed and marketed products like our Modular Computer Systems, PC security software like <a href=""http://www.secureupdater.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Secure Updater</a>, and even our own Modular 10.1"" Tablet.  We have a track record of identifying needs and successfully developing products to fill those needs.</p><p>But the Allen Band is a different type of project.  When we approached our SBA lenders seeking funds for the project they thought this was a great idea, but they wanted to see a monthly monitoring fee that would ""save or create"" multiple jobs.</p><p>The whole point of the Allen Band is to create a senior monitoring solution that had no monthly monitoring costs.  A monitoring center would certainly create a lot of jobs, but they are expensive.  We were not willing to abandon our free-monitoring principle, and as a result they were not willing to fund this project through traditional methods.</p><p>We have received an outpouring of fan support on our <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/theallenband"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Allen Band Facebook</a> page as well as emails and phone calls from people who want to help.  We decided that Indiegogo was the best way to fund the project and also collect valuable opinions and design advice by making our supporters part of the design process.</p><p>I have personally invested over $9,000 in this project to get it to where it is now, and I plan on spending more of my own money to make this device a reality.  My dad needs the Allen Band, and hundreds of others have asked us when they can buy one.  I would not ask you to back a project that I am not backing myself.</p><p>Our goal of $22,750 is enough for us to have the Allen Band designed and prototyped in a Chinese factory.  We would really love to design and build this in the U.S. If we can raise sufficient funding (4 times our goal) we should be able to build the Allen Band in America!  Please consider this as you are contributing!<br/></p><p><strong>What We Have Accomplished So Far</strong></p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FR2mYQveI878%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DR2mYQveI878%26feature%3Dyoutu.be&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FR2mYQveI878%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div>Since May we have completed a hardware design document and submitted it to several factories in the US and China for prototype development. We are currently working with the MultiGold Corporation in China to begin developing the molds and main board for the device.<p></p><p>We have selected TPE (thermo-plastic) for the construction of the band due to its flexibility, comfort, and durability.</p><p>MultiGold has informed us that the device prototype will take 6-8 months to produce. MultiGold is creating the prototype CAD drawings and we are working together to select the correct chipsets that will maximize battery life, reduce weight and bulk, and allow us to create a streamlined, attractive design.</p><p>We have also started the development of the cloud monitoring system that will receive data transmissions from the Allen Band and send alerts to Caregivers automatically.</p><p>The factory will be developing the iOS and Android apps for smartphones, and link them with the cloud system's API. <a href=""http://www.schrockinnovations.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Schrock Innovations Computer Company's</a> staff is coding the desktop PC application that will allow those without smartphones to pair the Allen Band to their wireless network in their homes.</p><p>The next step is to finalize the prototype design and produce 15 Alpha devices for field testing. We expect to field test on real seniors for a period no less than 30 days. This testing will focus on the utility of the design, ease of operation for seniors, and the accurate collection of data by the Allen Band and correctly processing that data in the cloud to send appropriate alerts.</p><p>Revisions will be made to the design if required. Each design revision will take between 30-60 days to finalize and produce another 15 units for field testing.

Other distribution channels will be opened as needed to mass-market further production runs.</p><p>We expect the design, development, and production process to wrap up in late 2016 with a targeted distribution date of December 2016.</p></div>","My father, Allen Schrock was not in the best of health, but he was self-sufficient enough to take care of himself.  One day in March of 2015 he fell and spent 24 hours on the floor before he was found.In that time his body literally started breaking down to the point that his doctors only gave him a 33% chance of surviving.  He did survive, but his quality of life is a fraction of what it was before the fall.I am creating the Allen Band (named after my father) to help families get their aging parents and grandparents the help the need as quickly as possible when they fall or need assistance.  If I would have found my father in four hours instead of 24 hours, I could have prevented much of his tissue damage and he would still be enjoying a good quality of life.What Exactly is the Allen Band?The Allen Band is a slim, stylish band that monitors a senior's heart rate, body temperature and mobility.  It sends automated alerts to family members (we call them Caregivers) if something is wrong or the wearer needs help.  It is very much like Life Alert but without any monthly monitoring fees whatsoever.Most devices like LifeAlert and MedicalAlert provide users with free hardware up front, but then saddle users with $41.95/month multi-year contracts for monitoring.   A typical senior will spend over $7,500 in monitoring expenses alone while using a Life Alert system over a 15 year period.The Idea behind the Allen Band is that the user pays a one-time cost (estimated at $399) for the Allen Band, and receives free monitoring services for life. The Allen Band can provide families with superior, personalized monitoring options while allowing seniors to stay at home where they want to be.Free Monitoring for LifeFree monitoring may seem too good to be true, but with today’s technology it is easily achievable. All of the current major senior monitoring systems rely on a pendant / base system that links the user directly to a live monitoring call center. These monitoring centers are extremely expensive to operate and are the driving expense behind existing cost-prohibitive monitoring devices.The Allen Band is different. Rather than routing emergency events to a call center, the Allen Band uses the Internet to directly notify family, friends, or even neighbors that mom or dad needs help.When a loved one falls, is inactive for an extended period of time, or experiences an event that is detected by the Allen Band, the band will ask the senior user if they are OK. If the senior user presses the OK button no alert is sent to family.  If the SOS button is pressed instead, a text message, email, and/or push notification is sent to the seniors’ caregivers letting them know what happened and that help is needed.More than Just an SOS ButtonThe Allen Band does offer senior users the ability to signal for help by double-pressing the SOS button, but it is more than just a panic button. The Allen Band uses the latest 21st century technology to measure specific biometric readings. The Allen Band can measure:
Heart Rate
Body Temperature (is there a fever or hypothermic state)
Sudden Falls
Lack of Motion Over an Extended Period
Connectivity Issues (No communication from the Allen Band)
Battery Status Issues (when battery is low, Caregiver is alerted)
GPS Location (using phone's location services) 
All of this data is sent to the monitoring cloud at regular intervals and each caregiver can ask the cloud monitoring system to alert them based on their own levels of concern.This eliminates the need for a call center to monitor each user, eliminating the monitoring costs. Each Allen Band can send alerts to up to 2 Caregivers at no cost whatsoever.Additional Caregivers can be added for $1.00 per month per Caregiver. The Caregiver, not the senior user, pays the $1.00 monthly monitoring charge to be added to the account. We use these small $1.00 payments to cover the cloud server monitoring expenses.Monitoring Options That are as Mobile as You AreUnlike traditional pendant / base monitoring solutions, the Allen band will communicate with the cloud over WiFi or via a Bluetooth connected smartphone. That means your Allen Band can monitor your loved ones at home or on the go.If a senior suffers a fall or needs to quickly and easily ask for help, a double button press on the Allen Band immediately alerts Caregivers to the need.  The Allen Band pulls the senior's GPS location from their smartphone and includes with the alert so Caregivers know where to send help.Stylish and DiscreteWe conducted over 100 interviews with seniors who have used or considered using the pendant / base monitoring systems.The leading consideration in a senior user’s decision to use an existing system was the monthly cost of monitoring followed closely by the stigma that is associated with the large and ugly wearable pendants.One respondent said she wouldn’t use a LifeAlert system even if she needed it because it was like “wearing a giant I am infirm"" sign around her neck. Another stated that she was 63 years old and probably needed a pendant but wouldn’t wear it because “it just isn’t cool.”The Allen Band will be designed to look like a slim fitness tracker. It even tells time! No one but the senior user and his/her caregivers will know that the Allen Band is hard at work. That is the way it should be.Why Indiegogo?Myself and my team of 15 employees at Schrock Innovations have successfully developed and marketed products like our Modular Computer Systems, PC security software like Secure Updater, and even our own Modular 10.1"" Tablet.  We have a track record of identifying needs and successfully developing products to fill those needs.But the Allen Band is a different type of project.  When we approached our SBA lenders seeking funds for the project they thought this was a great idea, but they wanted to see a monthly monitoring fee that would ""save or create"" multiple jobs.The whole point of the Allen Band is to create a senior monitoring solution that had no monthly monitoring costs.  A monitoring center would certainly create a lot of jobs, but they are expensive.  We were not willing to abandon our free-monitoring principle, and as a result they were not willing to fund this project through traditional methods.We have received an outpouring of fan support on our Allen Band Facebook page as well as emails and phone calls from people who want to help.  We decided that Indiegogo was the best way to fund the project and also collect valuable opinions and design advice by making our supporters part of the design process.I have personally invested over $9,000 in this project to get it to where it is now, and I plan on spending more of my own money to make this device a reality.  My dad needs the Allen Band, and hundreds of others have asked us when they can buy one.  I would not ask you to back a project that I am not backing myself.Our goal of $22,750 is enough for us to have the Allen Band designed and prototyped in a Chinese factory.  We would really love to design and build this in the U.S. If we can raise sufficient funding (4 times our goal) we should be able to build the Allen Band in America!  Please consider this as you are contributing!What We Have Accomplished So FarSince May we have completed a hardware design document and submitted it to several factories in the US and China for prototype development. We are currently working with the MultiGold Corporation in China to begin developing the molds and main board for the device.We have selected TPE (thermo-plastic) for the construction of the band due to its flexibility, comfort, and durability.MultiGold has informed us that the device prototype will take 6-8 months to produce. MultiGold is creating the prototype CAD drawings and we are working together to select the correct chipsets that will maximize battery life, reduce weight and bulk, and allow us to create a streamlined, attractive design.We have also started the development of the cloud monitoring system that will receive data transmissions from the Allen Band and send alerts to Caregivers automatically.The factory will be developing the iOS and Android apps for smartphones, and link them with the cloud system's API. Schrock Innovations Computer Company's staff is coding the desktop PC application that will allow those without smartphones to pair the Allen Band to their wireless network in their homes.The next step is to finalize the prototype design and produce 15 Alpha devices for field testing. We expect to field test on real seniors for a period no less than 30 days. This testing will focus on the utility of the design, ease of operation for seniors, and the accurate collection of data by the Allen Band and correctly processing that data in the cloud to send appropriate alerts.Revisions will be made to the design if required. Each design revision will take between 30-60 days to finalize and produce another 15 units for field testing. Again, the new units will be tested for 30 days to ensure any issues with the initial design have been corrected.Once we have a prototype that tests successfully, mass-production of 1,000 units will begin and should take 30-45 days to complete.The units will be made available to backers at that time first. Subsequently any contributor who gave $350 or more will receive their units first.  After our contributors are fulfilled, the Allen Band will be available for purchase form the Allen Band website, as well as our Schrock Innovations Service Centers. Other distribution channels will be opened as needed to mass-market further production runs.We expect the design, development, and production process to wrap up in late 2016 with a targeted distribution date of December 2016.",1.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p>ENGINEERING</p>
<p>To achieve the level of simplicity in user experience that we have, we have to design and engineer a very complex system.

We have written 1 patent (currently pending) for the virutal mobile technology based on mass production of the equipment. This includes finding partners that can mass produce the unit/system without any excessive usage of manpower. We have seen that this is one of the major risk to produce a product with zero / fewer fauts.</p>
<p>We have taken this lesson seriously and have been working for over 2 years negotiating with suppliers, component providers, and building a team that can deliver on our promises. Our plans are in place, and we now require the financial capital to execute them.</p>

<div>1.  Play continues even in moderate rain conditions. </div>

</div></div>","The RedClay Club announces new European RedClay court technology as the grass-roots foundation for a new safer school sport to offer our children. 
See our April 2016 national Press Release here announcing our School Initiative supported by this campaign, and the 5-Year plan to assimilate RedClay tennis into schools as a safer alternative to contact sports like football.
We want schools to teach children something they can play and enjoy for a lifetime.
Official RedClay Club sponsorships will help the RedClay School Initiative bring innovative, affordable European RedClay to American schools and start a whole new sporting culture in America.  Just like soccer from Europe did 30 years ago.


Nina's entire article on clay tennis, quoted above.Serena Williams, World #1, quoted in Paris at the French Open on traditional European red clay courts:  “I love the clay. I love to slide!”Serena and the new RedClay Club agree, so please join us to spread the word!A 2016 U.S. patent just announced by RCUSA makes the amazing TF2 RedClay court innovation from Germany marketable, affordable and practical... so kids can get out and ""play in the dirt"".   Here's How and Why it can Happen Now:From:  USTA 
To:  RedClay USA 
“I’m pleased to learn that you connected with  Scott Schultz [current USTA University Managing Director] on this initiative and I share his excitement about your plans to develop red clay courts in the U.S.”
Gordon SmithExecutive Director/COO, USTA""Thank you USTA!  We believe new German RedClay court technology and the new RedClay Club can help grow healthy lifestyles by rethinking American tennis with affordable, practical RedClay courts,"" --- 
The RedClay School Initiative Team This may be the national initiative that U.S. schools and the tennis world have been waiting for. Let's welcome our children to the next imported European classic...                                           The new RedClayClub.com, founded by RCUSA, is the proud voice of our exciting new national School Initiative! 

Contributors to this grassroots school campaign become lifetime RedClay Club members as they receive their perks.  See redclayclub.com for RedClay promotional items to wear.









The amazing TF2 RedClay court innovation finally knocks down the cost barriers of tennis for most Americans, reinforcing our effort to launch this cultural shift away from typical American hard courts for tennis.  


       

The RedClay School Initiative is centered around the newly patented European RedClay court technology, which breaks down the cost barrier for affordable clay tennis courts - - anywhere, even in U.S. climates where water must be conserved. RedClay tennis is a timely alternative and compliment to the more problematic contact sports one plays as a youth.  What Our Campaign Funds:  
It awards financial grants up to $25,000 to a limited number of schools and clubs to install their first TF2 courts used for their pilot-projects.  Our goal of $100,000 will help launch and operate our first pilot project sites listed here, and allow for additional first-come first-serve school sites through a successful on-going campaign.
What You Receive in Perks:
By contributing you can receive an early-bird court installation price.  Please contact us directly for details. Contributions and sponsorships can be tailored if you'd like to support your particular school or club choice by contacting us at: info@redclayusa.com.
Who We Are:
RCUSA LLC, and its RedClay Club and global partners, Tennis Force Intl. GmbH, and Sportas GmbH, are working to create TF2 RedClay court facilities around the world.  RCUSA is the exclusive USA distributor for Tennis Force products.             
What Is TF2 RedClay?We believe TF2 RedClay is the finest court innovation since clay tennis was invented.  TF2® RedClay, and is real terra cotta clay, just like that used in French Open courts, but now with dramatically improved functionality by mixing in proprietary polymers during a new installation process!  It's that simple.  It was awarded the most innovative tennis product in Germany for 2009 by German Tennis Magazine. It's real red clay without the prohibitive maintenance of a traditional clay tennis court, with 90% of those costs eliminated.  And the periodical resurfacing expense, associated with hard or traditional courts, is never needed with TF2.It's the easiest surface to learn and teach on.  Easiest on the body.  RedClay turns young students of the game into lifelong players - - constant players who love the exhilaration of sliding and competing, not just being fans.The German-engineered TF2 court technology means the USA no longer needs to ""asphalt-over"" the continuous acceptance of hard-court induced injuries. Please see more details and specifications about our new court technology at redclayusa.com and tennis-force.com. 
                              
                                           The 1.5"" TF2 RedClay base.

Clay courts can finally come out of the country and private clubs! TF2 RedClay court technology really means ""clay without the cost"", and a truer all-weather court.  Play during or right after rain, and it's also frost resistant. The lines are permanent and never need maintenance. 


School pilot-projects build TF2 courts with the help of grants made possible by contributions to this campaign.  
RedClay tennis can make learning tennis easier, so children and adults will tend to ""stick with it"" for a lifetime.

Quote:  
Teaching Pro Kevin Sorenson, Top-Tennis Club, Germany:
""After playing on our new TF2 outdoor courts, our longtime club members prefer to play on the new TF2 rather than our traditional older red clay courts, as they stay in top condition with virtually no maintanence."" 

The TF technology is used since 2009 by the WTA Porsche Grand Prix tournament in Stuttgart, the largest indoors women's tournament in the world. This is the first time a professional tournament is played on innovative clay that does not require watering!

See Porsche Stadium, Stuttgart photo below:


Quote:
WTA Touring Pro Coach Andy Fitzpatrick:  


""I am very impressed with the Tennis-Force court... it's an exciting  improvement over traditional RedClay from Europe!  They are more ideal than the French Open courts, because they're always in great condition with consistent safe sliding.""



RCUSA and redclayclub.com also seek School Initiative corporate partners as Official Sponsors.  Please see perks and contact us directly for exclusives at:  info@redclayusa.com








And, may we suggest to the Miami Open
...a change to TF2 RedClay to become America's first WTA/ATP RedClay professional tennis tournament!  
Here's the actual Miami Stadium and what it would look like with TF2 RedClay (it's photoshopped!)...but that's a real Miami sunset!





Advantages of TF2 RedClay for the Miami Open:  
1.  Play continues even in moderate rain conditions. 
2.  Play can resume immediately after heavy rain stops, because TF2 RedClay is very water permeable and the surface is clear of puddled water.
3.  Sliding is very exciting to watch live...and we don't see enough of it in America!
Read No. 3 as, ""Mom, Dad...I want to do that!"", a quote from your all-American seven-year old boy or girl!


RCUSA and its global partners have grand plans for ""courting"" America's youth and letting kids fall in love with the fun and excitement of sliding around on RedClay courts and learning a lifestyle based on a traditional European social activity.





The British and Europeans, who of course gave us soccer, want American kids to join the tradition of playing in the ""red dirt"" - -  and without the contact-sport injuries!  We hit only tennis balls!  


Quote:

“TFI is pleased to partner and support RCUSA with their RedClay School Initiative in America.  All the Tennis Force partners in Europe wish great success for the school pilot projects.  
We hope it starts the trend of American families playing on RedClay their entire lives, just as it’s been in our culture for over 100 years.”  
 Alex Vuga, Managing Director, Tennis Force Intl. GmbH, Switzerland




Quote:  
Former ATP Pro Coach Peter Lundgren to RCUSA
“Americans are long overdue experiencing the health benefits and aesthetics of the red clay culture enjoyed in Europe. All the artistic play for which Roger (Federer) is known, plus the down-in-the-dirt excitement of today’s game.” 
Former Coach of Roger Federer, Marat Safin, Grigor Dimitrov, Marcelo Rios, Stan Wawrinka





                      Some Open Questions About American Tennis 


""USA tennis needs more clay, but how??   It's too expensive!"", a standard quote from ""every U.S. tennis instructor, fan and commentator"" for the last 25 years!  

Why was the U.S. Open played on clay for three years in the '70's?

TF2 RedClay provides the answer:  ""Clay without the cost, for anywhere!""




                                               


RCUSA hopes theTF2 RedClay court technology will be considered by the USTA as a potential new ""10-and-under"" component for next-generation USTA Youth Tennis programs.


RCUSA believes this exciting technology makes TF2 RedClay the most economical tennis court ever...therefore putting tennis within the reach of everyone in America.  









Since TF2 RedClay has virtually no maintenance and very little or no water usage, all for the same or lesser installation price of other traditional hard or clay surfaces, clay tennis can now be considered viable for public court use.
No longer should clay court tennis be called only a ""country club"" or ""private club"" sport.
And no longer just a school sport, because it's a great lifelong activity if played on clay. Just ask any European!

                                      



Be part of the leading voices for the RedClay School Initiative. 
          




HERE'S OUR FIRST PLANNED SCHOOL PROJECTS:


Pilot-project school site:  Brandywine Tennis, FL



Brandywine Tennis in DeLand, FL is converting their entire complex of green clay and hard courts to TF2 RedClay.  
The nation's first planned complete club retrofit from old green American clay and  hard courts to the new TF2 RedClay from Germany!
Brandywine projects they will save thousands of dollars per clay court per year in maintenance costs alone with the new TF2 RedClay courts.
Brandywine is working with St. Barnabas, Southwestern and DeLand Middle Schools.  St. Barnabas' School Principal, Paul Garcia states the RedClay School Initiative is, ""...informative and motivating. I appreciate you including St. Barnabas in it and you have my support.""
Brandywine is already working with local schools to accommodate foreign students who would live and practice at Brandywine while attending school.


A sample piece of a TF2 RedClay court is held here (above) by a Brandywine student to promote the club's conversion to TF2 RedClay.
 Ryan Bauman, Tennis Director and Operations Manager, Brandywine Tennis, DeLand, FL, discussing the idea of TF2 RedClay, kids and local schools:  above.



Above: Ryan discussing how TF2 court technology changes the tennis world in the USA. 


Above:  The Brandywine Clubhouse and hard courts scheduled for TF2 conversion.


The diagram below is the proposed Brandywine Tennis Club conversion plans:

“…this innovative new court technology makes TF2 RedClay a perfect fit for Florida schools and our club, and everywhere in the U.S.  The RedClay School Initiative can really introduce kids to this imported ""sport"", the best new alternative to traditional school contact sports!"", Ryan Bauman, Operations Manager, Brandywine Tennis, DeLand Florida





Pilot-project school site: Boyne Mountain, Michigan 




The Rod Laver Tennis Camp was held at the Boyne Mountain Resort in Michigan during the 1970's. Today Boyne Mountain and Boyne Highlands hope to re-ignite the tennis passion of the 1970's through introduction of the new TF2 RedClay on which students can learn to love tennis.


Boyne Resorts is the second largest ski and golf resort operator in the USA.


Pilot Project school site:  Traverse City, Michigan 
Traverse City, Michigan's public school LEAP Tennis Coordinator (Learning, Enrichment and Athletics Program), Chris Michalowski, is working to integrate a school/club tennis program using the TF2 RedClay courts.
Chris states, 
“We're happy to be in the front of a cultural shift from hard courts to clay tennis and offer this new technology to change the ways schools can present tennis to their students.  
We’re glad to take a leadership role to import a re-engineered RedClay tennis court that’s proven successful in Europe.  I’m convinced it will help create a great new school tennis program and be a good lifestyle addition for students and their families.”
“Making the shift to TF2® RedClay tech courts will set a club apart from the rest as well as improve the longevity of members when it comes to playing this lifetime sport. TF2 RedClay will enable us to develop a more well rounded game in junior players, allowing them more opportunities to become successful using different styles and tactics.” 
Chris ""Mick"" Michalowski, Public School Tennis Coordinator, Traverse City Michigan

Pilot-Project school site:  Providence, Rhode Island
Larry Sack, Tennis Director, SPOT Program



SPOT (Serving Providence Organized Tennis) is working to bring RedClay tennis to several local schools in the area where Larry's efforts over the years have been awarded with the Top 50 Welcome Tennis Centers in the nation and New England Community Tennis Association of the year 2014 by the USTA.
“I look forward to being part of the inaugural RedClay Club and working with the RCUSA to promote their message of new RedClay tennis technology for our school systems. I believe RedClay tennis offers a great alternative to contact sports that children learn and play for a lifetime, especially now that innovation has eliminated the burdensome costs associated with clay,”  says Larry Sack.

                                 Every kid will want his own RedClay tennis court!


                                               




Can RedClay tennis can become as popular as football and soccer in the USA?  

Yes! 
America is now far more aware of the inherent problems of football and contact sports.
New TF2 RedClay court technology can be the literal game-changer for increasing the popularity of tennis in U.S. schools and clubs - - as a definitive new alternative to contact sports, (Purdue University research on concussions, August 2015)
The TF2 courts are the answer to the dangerous school contact sports, (LeBron  James, ""No Football in My House"", ESPN.com, Nov. 2014) we keep indoctrinating our youngest, year after year, without new options.

<h2>What IS Purple, Anyway?</h2>
</div><div>Purple™ is a Hyper-Elastic™ polymer, which is super stretchy and super strong. That means it’s durable and your mattress won’t develop a body impression. It is also temperature neutral, hypoallergenic, responsive, and comfortable!<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1380.photobucket.com/albums/ah178/Andie_Towanda_Pearce/Purple-Stretch_zpsbmjrrooo.gif"" src="""" style=""background-color: initial;""/>
</div><div>
<h2>How Does Purple Work?</h2>
<p>Purple™ is designed to give in under pressure-sensitive areas, like your hips and shoulders, and remain firm under the broader areas that need support like your back and legs - no matter where you are on the mattress. And those same hollow columns that make that possible naturally create airflow, allowing you to sleep on a temperature-neutral, breathable sleep surface.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/004/534/683/4d90effd635033b681332400e307e057_original.gif?v=1442793306&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;q=92&amp;s=27ddf519f537069eb1d2283d8092e094"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>

<p><i>Purple™ is responsive enough for quality time with your partner, but won't jostle you around when they stir in the night. One more way the Purple™ bed is a no-compromise mattress.</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448494045/fferdlhonyug6nimaeew.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2>Who Needs Purple™?</h2>
<p>Everyone. </p>
<p>Seriously… everyone. And that means <b>you</b>.</p>
<p>Sleep is vitally important to mental and physical health. Maximizing the quality of sleep without a reliance on chemical sleep aids should be a priority for everyone. Purple provides the best pressure relief and back support on the market - two of the most important elements to a healthy sleep cycle. Good sleep means better health and alertness. And that probably means you’ll be better at your job and make more money. And that’s attractive!</p>

<h2>How Did Purple™ Come About?</h2>
<p>1989 found two brothers, engineers Tony and Terry Pearce, fly fishing in the Rockies and talking about partnering to change the world. Tony’s 13 years of experience in advanced aerospace materials, and Terry’s 20 years of experience in manufacturing, design, and project management, led to a partnership creating high-tech carbon fiber sporting goods and wheelchairs.</p>
<p>By 1993, wheelchair users that were testing the Pearce’s wheelchairs let them know that the real need was in better wheelchair cushioning. Pressure sores were a really bad part of their lives. Taking that challenge, the Pearces created Floam™, the world’s lightest-weight cushioning fluid. Soon, Floam™ had five patents and was being used in not only wheelchair cushions, but also by major licensees of the Pearces in critical-care medical beds (Hill-Rom), footwear (Nike), ankle/knee braces (Johnson &amp; Johnson), golf bag straps (Top-Flite), neonatal intensive care (preemie baby) ‘nests’, surgical positioning cushions, surgical tourniquet cushions, ballet cushions, industrial knee pads, and more.</p>
<p>Now known for the world’s most advanced cushioning products, the Pearces set out to create a technology that could revolutionize cushioning at a much lower cost than Floam™. Purple™ began to evolve through a series of discoveries and product developments. The first breakthrough came in the 1990s, when the Pearces invented hyper-elastic polymer. This amazingly soft, strong material could stretch 15 times its resting size, was uber-durable, and never took a body impression. The key discovery came when hyper-elastic polymer was molded in a shape that could “release” under pressure hot spots, redistributing the pressure to other areas. The same feature turned out to give amazing back support in mattresses. As time went on, the predecessor-products of Purple™ came to be licensed to makers of critical care medical beds (Stryker Medical); consumer mattresses in Europe (Swan by Ekornes), Japan (Francebed), and Australia (Sleepmaker); backpack straps (Jansport); shoe insoles (Dr. Scholl’s Massaging Gel and Sof-Sole); pillows (Sleep Innovations); soft-catch toy balls (Nickelodeon); seat cushions (WonderGel); wheelchair cushions (EquaPressure); and many other advanced cushioning products. In all, the Pearces have over 30 cushioning patents, and are known the world over as the premier source for superior cushioning technology.</p>
<p>Three years ago, the Pearces set out to combine all their knowledge of cushioning into the world’s best mattress. Hyper-elastomeric polymer had never been able to be molded into pieces as large as king-size mattresses. Even with only partial surface coverage, the mattresses made in Australia and Europe were too expensive to have hope of millions of people getting more comfortable. To make great mattresses, the whole surface needed to be hyper-elastic polymer, and the mattresses needed to be produced at high rates with low labor input. A patent-pending machine called Mattress Max was created, taking over two years and several million dollars. Now, Purple™ for mattresses is made in the USA by Mattress Max in single pieces large enough to fully cover a king-size mattress, and at production rates/costs that will help millions of people change their lives. Better than any $4000 mattress for about $1000 – that was the goal, and Purple™ achieved it.</p>
<p>Why Purple™? Well, why not? It is an awesome color, and it signifies treating everyone like royalty. The Pearces have spent most of their high-tech careers advancing the world of cushioning. With Purple™, they know they have put all they’ve learned into the world’s greatest bed, and they’ve figured out how to do it so everyone can afford it.</p>

</div><div>This is actually the very same foam that we use in the Purple™ Bed under the Purple. It's fantastic high quality, and relatively comfortable foam, but look at what a difference the Purple makes!</div></div>","Thank you so much to everyone who has helped Purple get our running start! We are amazed and astounded at the support we've received from our early adopters :D We are discontinuing our InDemand as we are now fully launched on our own website. Sweet Dreams!So what's in it for me?

What IS Purple, Anyway?
Purple™ is a Hyper-Elastic™ polymer, which is super stretchy and super strong. That means it’s durable and your mattress won’t develop a body impression. It is also temperature neutral, hypoallergenic, responsive, and comfortable!

How Does Purple Work?
Purple™ is designed to give in under pressure-sensitive areas, like your hips and shoulders, and remain firm under the broader areas that need support like your back and legs - no matter where you are on the mattress. And those same hollow columns that make that possible naturally create airflow, allowing you to sleep on a temperature-neutral, breathable sleep surface.


Purple™ is responsive enough for quality time with your partner, but won't jostle you around when they stir in the night. One more way the Purple™ bed is a no-compromise mattress.


Who Needs Purple™?
Everyone. 
Seriously… everyone. And that means you.
Sleep is vitally important to mental and physical health. Maximizing the quality of sleep without a reliance on chemical sleep aids should be a priority for everyone. Purple provides the best pressure relief and back support on the market - two of the most important elements to a healthy sleep cycle. Good sleep means better health and alertness. And that probably means you’ll be better at your job and make more money. And that’s attractive!

What is the Purple™ Bed?






The Purple™ Bed is soft where you want it and firm where you need it, providing you with optimal body alignment and comfort. Mattresses may take 2-3 weeks to ship after your order while we get everything finalized.
Purple™ vs Other Mattress Fillings


What is the Purple™ Top?
The Purple™ Top improves your existing mattress. But let’s get reasonable, if you have a quality mattress that is just too firm, this is a good option! But if you have a soft pillow top mattress or if your mattress has a big sag in it, the Purple™ Top won’t fix the problem! The Purple™ Top improves good-but-firm mattresses -- it is not a band-aid for broken down mattresses. Toppers are scheduled to begin shipping January 2016.

</div></div>","Short Summary vaidyagrama healing community is an idea borne of the desire to ""Live Simple Live Well Live Healthy Live Happy"". The community is being created around the vaidyagrama Ayurveda healing village located in the midst of farmland outside Coimbatore.
The community has been conceived by a group of Ayurveda physicians and patients and well wishers who are passionate about living in tune with nature, being aligned with nature. This group has created the healing village where patients with different health issues from all over the world come for treatment through Ayurveda.
The healing community is an natural extension of the healing village; many patients and others desire to continue to live in the vicinity of the village so as to get -



a healing environment


good Ayurveda treatment


natural food


an Ayurveda way of life

and most importantly, to give back to the environment

The idea is to recycle, reuse, restore and recreate a community living in harmony with the surrounding environment. It is a holistic and comprehensive approach to creating a healing model that can be easily replicated in other parts of India.
This community incorporates 15 villages and a population of around 13000 people, of which around 10% are below the age of 6. Providing health, education, sanitation and meaningful and sustainable work is an important part of the objectives of the vaidyagrama healing community.
What We Need & What You Get
We need 100000 people to contribute USD 100 each. This amount goes to -




secure the land for the community; all land in this project will belong to the community and will not be owned by any particular individual


ensure that 70% of the land comes under agro-forestry the natural way


build homes and other public infrastructure on the remaining 30% of the land


introduce small cottage industries like beekeeping, animal husbandry, weaving, bamboo products, banana pulp products all of which can be done at the individual homes level


build a ""how to live"" school


create infrastructure for providing medical care effectively using nature's resources

inculcate the ""principles of natural living"" in the community so as to ""live simple live well live healthy live happy
   The Impact Thus the Global Community Supports the Local Community to Support the Global Community
A model community that stays aligned with nature; lives in tune with nature; and can be replicated in other parts of India and abroad
Risks & Challenges
 The challenges in this project include -



creating infrastructure is easy; ""human change"" is far more difficult.


moving the entire community from ""money focus"" to ""happiness focus""


moving the entire community into ""self sustainability"" and ""living off the land""


restoring the faith of the community in ""natural farming""


restoring the faith of the community in the use of herbs to take care of health


restoring the faith of the community in their own culture, systems and practices


Patience, persistence and prayer is the way forward; working with each member of the community and building trust and faith in them in their own abilities is what we have already been doing over the past 5 years; and we will continue to do that and thereabout create the change required for building the above community

<p>I am confident there are some people out there who believe in holistic, complementary care, and the impact a healthy lifestyle and diet can have on one’s health.  If you’re out there, would you please help me by contributing to my campaign to get to Paracelsus?  I am willing to commit to doing my part--changing my diet, reducing stress, meditating more, practicing yoga, etc., in order to recover my health. </p>
<p>Here's my story:</p>
<p>I have been self-employed as a massage therapist for almost 20 years. I am single and live with my canine companion, who is an angel disguised as the cutest mutt ever! Although I believe allopathic medicine is very useful for some things, I am a huge proponent of alternative and complementary healthcare, and focus my energy on living a simple, healthy lifestyle. I believe the environment, what I put into and onto my body, and how I manage my mind has a huge impact on my health.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Two years ago, I developed large uterine fibroids.  I had severe abdominal and low back pain and became unable to poop, had to pee all the time, my legs got numb, virtually anything I ate made me sick, I couldn’t sleep and had severe mood swings.  Being in a relationship was completely out of the question!  The doctors said a hysterectomy would solve all these problems (except finding a relationship partner!!). Being self-employed it is extremely difficult to get affordable health insurance.  But I decided to find health insurance, whatever the cost, so I could get that surgery and feel like a normal human being again.  After the surgery, I planned to let the insurance go, since I knew I couldn’t afford to keep it, and, anyway, I prefer alternative care for most things, which insurance doesn’t cover.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So, I had the surgery 8 months ago.  While I was insured, I decided to get some routine testing done, like a mammogram, bone density scan, etc.  Much to my horror they discovered that not only do I have osteoporosis (I’m only 50!), but also I was diagnosed with breast cancer.  I kept the insurance, moved to a cheaper apartment, and had bilateral lumpectomies.  Of course, being a massage therapist, having these surgeries meant I couldn’t work.  I got extremely lucky and found administrative work at a spa—it pays ¼ of what I could make doing massage, but, hey, it’s a job, and I’m grateful!  I waited patiently for my body to heal from the surgeries and the symptoms to go away.  All the while bills were accumulating from the insurance deductible and the portion of the medical bills that insurance didn’t cover, bills that I don’t have money to pay.  I’m determined not to have to file for bankruptcy, and equally determined to stay positive, not stress, and focus on getting better so I can contribute to society by doing work that I love and that supports me.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That hasn’t happened.  I still have severe abdominal pain, can eat only a few foods without getting sick, can’t sleep, and have fallen into a severe depression.  Further testing has shown large liver cysts, a soft tissue tumor of unknown origin in my abdomen, severe heavy metal poisoning, inflammation around my heart and malnourishment since my body isn’t digesting food properly.  I’m exhausted from going from doctor to doctor and finding no definitive diagnosis, and from trying treatment after treatment that hasn’t worked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am desperate to find a practitioner who can see the whole picture, a Dr. House-type diagnostician, so I can begin the project of healing and getting my life back. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In my search for a real Dr. House, I discovered Biological Medicine and the work of Thomas Rau, MD, who runs Paracelsus Clinic in Switzerland.  <a href=""http://www.paracelsus.ch"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.paracelsus.ch</a>.  Immediately, I resonated with the work he’s doing and felt hope for the first time in years that I might actually be able to identify what's unbalanced, get treatment, feel well and change my life.  But Paracelsus is not covered by US insurance (although most European insurances do cover treatment there, I've been told).  The cost is moderate by US standards, but not if I must pay the entirety out-of-pocket.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I discovered a foundation in the States that partially supports in-need patients who are committed to the Biological Medicine approach to receive treatment at Paracelsus.  I applied for help and have been offered $5,000, which is enough to cover one week of treatment there.  This feels like an incredible opportunity for me to learn to take responsibility for my health and to heal.  However, I can only accept this money if I can raise the same amount of money to cover the second week of the required two-week stay. I must also raise money to cover accommodation ($1,400) and airfare to Switzerland ($1,200) and remedies and infusions to bring home with me ($1-2,000).  (EXCITING UPDATE:  on 8/11 I was gifted enough frequent flyer miles to get a roundtrip ticket to Switzerland!!!  I truly believe that anything is possible now!)  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I don’t want to live out my life barely able to make it through the day, making my dog turn back for home after only walking for a few minutes, wondering what’s wrong with me and wanting to die.  Nor do I want to face further surgeries, radiation and chemo, treatments that I don't believe in and may well jeopardize my quality of life just because that is what my insurance will agree to cover.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My goal is to reach a place where I’m well enough to use my experiences and healing gifts to give back to those in need, and well enough to give my canine angel the ""mom"" he deserves!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am so grateful to you for reading my story and contributing anything you are able.  Any money I receive in excess of my goal, I will contribute to Santa Fe Small Dog Rescue, in honor of my canine companion, who has given me a reason to keep going, makes me laugh and has taught me so much about unconditional love! </p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Right now I'm not accepting anymore donations, I haven't honoured my campaigns perk claims yet because oh my health problems, so until then I won't be starting a new campaign.</p>
<p>Right now, unfortunately, the 2,000 I raised wasn't enough to cover the costs of a more aggressive treatment, however, I was able to pay for my current treatment without going farther into debt. So far the receipts for my treatment costs amount to 2,000 and by the end of this month I will have used up all I raised. So I was able to spread the funds over many months.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The problem with more aggressive treatment was that I would have to drive to the US to get the medications. After that they would need to be injected by a professional who could give me medical attention if I had a reaction post injection. No one in Canada would agree to do this. I would have to inject in the US then do the rest myself (if done incorrectly it could be fatal).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I'm not comfortable injecting myself since it's in the bum and I can't see to make sure I'm not injecting into a vein. Also, I'd have to pay for blood tests  to check my organs because again ohip won't cover it here. So I decided that I should stay on oral antibiotics.</p>
<p>I may have to start a new campaign if this treatment isn't effective. So far, I haven't improved, but I also haven't slid back. I am better and more capable of functioning than I was 9 months ago.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Because of internet harassment, I am seriously thinking about how I want to continue... we'll see.</p>

<p> <strong style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">Our Story</strong></p><p>How did GoodLife Mobility's mission evolve?  Our roots are in surfing, and in 2003, I built my first prototype.  As an aging surfer, I was running out of paddle power and was tired of missing literally hundreds of waves.</p>
<p>A pivotal moment for my work came in 2004 when
I met a courageous young surfer who became a quadriplegic after
being injured by a fluke wave.  With no feeling from the chest down and
very limited use of his arms, he did not let his condition stop him. I
watched in awe as his surfing friends pushed him into scary waves in Ventura,
California.</p>
<p>I immediately knew that
others needed electric assist technology more than I did. That realization, plus
years of engineering innovations, resulted in  the world’s first joystick-controlled, steerable electric surfboard. Using this board  at a
Malibu beach test session in June 2012, the  young surfer was able to surf independently
again. He caught a lot of waves, hung out in the surf for over an hour, and
even used the electric assist board to tow his buddies!</p>

Hi, My Name is Dainuri Rott.  I am a Surfer, Veteran and Founder / Executive Director of GoodLife Mobility (GLM).
GLM is a 501(c)(3) non profit dedicated to innovative engineering . We provide the world with our adaptive water sports technology.
Our mission is to improve the quality of life for people facing physical and emotional challenges by developing innovative mobility solutions for flat water and ocean recreation.
GLM's present focus is providing  individuals with limitations with electric powered Adaptive SUPs (Stand Up Paddle Boards) and electric powered Adaptive Wave Skis for surfing.
Our Ambassadors 
In the flat water world of lakes, rivers, and estuaries, our ambassador is Veteran Sean Ryan.   In the video above you heard Sean talk about his experience with our innovative adaptive SUP in a San Francisco Bay Marina.   
Our ambassador is Veteran Mark Thornton, a wave-skier with paraplegia.   Mark lives in the San Diego area and is excited about sharing the joy of the Adaptive Wave Ski with fellow veterans.Our GoalsWith Sean leading the way, our goal is to build 2 robust and reliable adapted SUPs, with 1 for use by Veteran's Program Outreach, and 1 for various Challenged Athletes in the San Francisco Bay Area. We'll be working with the recreation therapists at the Palo Alto and Menlo Park Veterans Hospitals  and with established Veterans organizations such as Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA) and Disabled American Veterans (DAV.) And we'll be doing our own outreach to get veterans and challenged athletes out on the water for fun, mobility and independence.    We will also do the same for the 2 units in the San Diego area.Where will your contribution go?We are a lean organization fueled by volunteer labor and a minimum of cash.   In our  project to build an electric assist surfboard for an injured competitive surfer (see story below) we had 6 volunteers donating over 1700 hours, and 5 business sponsors who donated materials and labor. We plan to run the Water Mobility outreach program in  a similar fashion and will continue to use volunteers to cover outreach for the SF bay area and San Diego.Here is a breakdown of our $50,000 goal that will bring 2 Adaptive SUPs and 2 Adaptive Wave Skis to veterans in the San Francisco Bay and San Diego areas.
 Our StoryHow did GoodLife Mobility's mission evolve?  Our roots are in surfing, and in 2003, I built my first prototype.  As an aging surfer, I was running out of paddle power and was tired of missing literally hundreds of waves.
A pivotal moment for my work came in 2004 when
I met a courageous young surfer who became a quadriplegic after
being injured by a fluke wave.  With no feeling from the chest down and
very limited use of his arms, he did not let his condition stop him. I
watched in awe as his surfing friends pushed him into scary waves in Ventura,
California.
I immediately knew that
others needed electric assist technology more than I did. That realization, plus
years of engineering innovations, resulted in  the world’s first joystick-controlled, steerable electric surfboard. Using this board  at a
Malibu beach test session in June 2012, the  young surfer was able to surf independently
again. He caught a lot of waves, hung out in the surf for over an hour, and
even used the electric assist board to tow his buddies!
Below is a picture of Julia Olson (who sustained a spinal chord injury in a car accident) riding the joystick controlled board in Foster City Ca.  She had a blast and would love to have access to one.Most of the effort put into the electric surfboard was self-funded and assisted by small donations. In 2010, we got a big boost from a quality of life grant from the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation; most of the engineering effort is from volunteers, individuals, and companies who have generously donated their time and resources.To get a listing of some of the contributors and see the board in action, please click on this link:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bbq1Uz5nR3wWhere we are nowOver the years, I’ve encountered a lot of other people like the courageous young surfer who could benefit from this adaptive technology, especially our warriors who were wounded in service to our country.I believe in the healing power or fun, recreation, and just being out on the water.  My sense is that experience helps heal all of us, especially if we're dealing with gnarly conditions like PTSD.I am especially eager to give back the joy of being on the water to our returning vets.  I'd like to see every VA Hospital and recreation center have adaptive water sports and this Indiegogo campaign is an important beginning toward that goal.Our ongoing supportersWe have been overwhelmed by the support provided by so many folks along the way.

</p><h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Mission Atletica began in 2004 to fulfill a dream that began with my first pair of shoes. I was 14 years old. Born and raised in a poor area of Guatemala, running in those loafers became my salvation and I knew while I was running that I wanted to do something big for the sport of running, and help runners like myself who cannot afford to buy a pair of running shoes. <br/><br/>While working for a U.S. non-profit in 2003, a donated box of used running shoes took me back to the frustration and disappointments I experienced as a young athlete unable to get a decent pair of sports shoes. It's hard if you have the will for running and you don't have the main tool which is a pair of running shoes, so I asked if I could take the shoes for runners like myself. </p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We want to support a big race taking place in Quetzaltenango, Guatemala on June 15, 2014.  Our goal is to ship 10,000 pairs of running shoes to be given to the runners of this race.  We need help funding the cost of the shipping which is $2.00 per pair of running shoes, that is $20,000 in shipping costs.  In addition we are trying to rent warehouse space in San Rafael, CA to be used to sort and ready the shoes for shipping.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As of today I've donated 2,500 pairs of sports shoes to Guatemala, and runners of all ages are winning in national competitions. Track, in field and road races, is growing and the entire country is benefitting as kids put energy and ambition into running/sports rather than the gangs and crime 36 years of civil war brought to Guatemala, (1960-1996).</p>

Track, in field and road races, is growing and the entire country is benefitting as kids put energy and ambition into running/sports rather than the gangs and crime 36 years of civil war brought to Guatemala, (1960-1996).

<h3>Why</h3>
<p>I spent my life in the EOD community and I have been very fortunate and blessed, there are many of my brothers out there that were not so lucky, but they gladly volunteered to save the lives of people they never met in far off lands like Iraq and Afghanistan, they came back wounded, and the least I can do is to honor their sacrifice.</p>
<p>When I tell people I'm running 31 miles, they think I'm crazy, and I just might be, but I can still try and run 31 miles, many of my brothers cannot.  I run for them.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>100% of the funds will go directly to the EOD Warrior Foundation.  This site charges me 3% to manage the money, I will donate the 3% back.  What you get is to know you are helping those who would save your life without ever having met you.</p>

<h3 class=""western"">Short Summary</h3>
<p>I have been building on this Sonic for a few years now, and its gotten to the point where I am almost satisfied with it enough to be able to give it away. In order to make it well enough though, and professionally enough, i require a CNC mill, which will cost around $600. Can you help me raise that much?</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<h3 class=""western"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>A decent CNC mill costs anywhere between 500 dollars and a few thousand. For these screwdrivers, we just need a basic model. Something that can cut groves and straight lines nice and neatly.</p>
<p>We have set this raiser up so regardless of the amount achieved, the money will go to an investment kitty, so that when we eventually raise enough, we will be able to manufacture them and send them to all those who donated.</p>
<p>We will not be offering any perks for this, apart from one. If you donate $75, and we raise enough for a CNC mill, We will make you your own tailor made screwdriver for free. It could have a brushed aluminum finish or painted with the authentic crackle paint similar to the paint used in Doctor Who! if you would like yours longer or shorter than the others, that can be tailored as well.</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<h3 class=""western"">The Impact</h3>
<p>If we manage to break our target, it will allow us to make high quality replica sonic screwdrivers that could be given away to those who want them. these screwdrivers double up as a personal torch and unlike the toy screwdrivers, these feel like a tool rather than a toy.</p>
<p>Given that there are two choices for authentic screwdrivers on the market today, $30ish for the toy, or $400 for the replica, why not give one of these a go instead? they may not be authentic, but they look and feel the part!</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<h3 class=""western"">Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you do not feel like donating, or cannot at the moment, you could tell others of this fundraiser or even give feedback in the comments section about ideas or changes you think are justified to this design!</p>

<h3>A New Start:</h3>
<p>Sometimes, new starts are long, planned out adventures.  All the ducks are in a row and all of the i's have been dotted. And, sometimes, life happens.</p>
<p>I have a chance for a new start that, while I wasn't quite planning on it, I'm actually extremely excited about.  It's simple.  I had a job and a paycheck and everything seemed fine.  Opening my own practice again was a ""down the road"" kind of thing.    And then life happened.  Now it's a ""wheels on the pavement"" kind of thing.  By the way, the loss of the job was a result of major cutbacks in insurance reimbursements for chiropractors in Tennessee.  Nothing ""bad"" happened.  There was simply no budget left to pay for my position after the cuts.  </p>
<p>My intention is to open a very simple, very laid back, but very effective practice.  I want to bring my nearly two decades of experience to bear in a  much more intimate setting.  I've spent the recent past in a great, but very busy practice.  As I write this, I have just turned 50.  My pace has changed.  My intentions have grown up a bit and I'm ready for a slow, but fun and results driven practice.   Building from the start with an ultra-low overhead model will allow me to do just this.  </p>
<p>I have an amazing opportunity to do it right here in Chattanooga.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>But,</h3>
<p>I need your help.  Nothing like asking friends and family for money, but that's exactly where I find myself.  To be clear, I'm not asking for donations or charity.  I plan to pay you back.  And, yes, you might even get a t-shirt.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>It's big.</h3>
<p>The impact of your contribution is actually big for me.  The timing in this whole adventure is really fantastic with the one glaring exception of the ability to cover my start-up costs.  Like I said, I didn't pick the timing.  But, in the age-old ""make lemonade"" way, I'm going to do more than just get by.  I'm going to make it a great thing.</p>
<p>I'm trying to raise $7,500.  Which really isn't much to start a practice.  But it's more than I can put my hands on at the moment, and the moment happens to be here now.  So, I ask.</p>
<p>I anticipate needing around $3,000 for clinical equipment, $2,000 for furnishings, and the last $2,500 for a little working capital to get things started.  That's it.  </p>
<p>For Chattanooga locals, there are options.  If you prefer, you can use any contribution toward future care.  And, if you contribute $1,000, I will take care of you for free for as long as I'm in practice.  That should give you at least 15 years!  If you contribute $2,000, I'll take care of you and your immediate family for as long as I'm in practice.  I'd love to give you that as a show of my appreciation.</p>

<p><br/>My name is Anna Clarissa and I hope to attend the Nutrition Consultant program at Bauman College. It is an 18 month program that teaches students in-depth knowledge about using whole foods as preventative medicine and promoting overall health. The goal of the program is to change the way people consume food from convenience to conscious eating. In my personal research, I have learned a lot about health, and I love sharing what I've learned with others. Currently, I share nutritional tips and recipes through my social media accounts or in person with friends, family, and coworkers. It is rewarding to be able to help others change their lives for the better, and I hope to do professionally as a Holistic Nutritionist. I have decided to do this campaign in order to make that career plan happen.</p>
<h3>How it all began......</h3>
<p>In the summer of 2010, I became really sick. I lost a lot of weight, I was tired all the time, and one morning, I just flat out fainted in the hallway walking to the bathroom. I went to the doctor's to see what was wrong. They drew my blood, and did all these tests. However, they were never able to figure out what made me so sick. They gave me medication to help with my symptoms, and sent on my way. The medication worked, BUT, like most medications, it had side effects. The side effects created other problems, more symptoms. I had been taking the medication for almost a year when I got fed up. I thought, ""this isn't a normal life!"". I began to do research on my own and looked up foods that would alleviate my symptoms. It's been six years and all my symptoms are gone! I am off all medication! I haven't taken a pill for anything in years, not even for a cold.<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487621467/vk3qnis3cp0mc07lslhb.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 430px;height: 305px;""/><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487621395/doxumux5678s4f2psilt.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 296px;height: 398px;""/></p>

<br/>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The break down in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>My tuition for the program is $7944, and money raised above that goal would go to school related expenses like books, supplies, and food preparations.</li>
<li>All of the perks are from me, and designed around your special dietary restrictions.</li>
<li>If I don't reach my goal, I will still find a way to raise the rest of the tuition as I am determined to pursue this path.</li>
</ul>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>With the upward trend in clean eating, there is also lots of conflicting information that say ""eat that"" and later say ""don't eat that"". I will have the scientific knowledge to support and guide individuals on the diet that is right for them.</li>
<li>I will have knowledge (beyond food) to guide people to an overall healthy lifestyle.</li>

It is an 18 month program that teaches students in-depth knowledge about using whole foods as preventative medicine and promoting overall health. The goal of the program is to change the way people consume food from convenience to conscious eating. In my personal research, I have learned a lot about health, and I love sharing what I've learned with others. Currently, I share nutritional tips and recipes through my social media accounts or in person with friends, family, and coworkers. It is rewarding to be able to help others change their lives for the better, and I hope to do professionally as a Holistic Nutritionist. I have decided to do this campaign in order to make that career plan happen.
How it all began......
In the summer of 2010, I became really sick. I lost a lot of weight, I was tired all the time, and one morning, I just flat out fainted in the hallway walking to the bathroom. I went to the doctor's to see what was wrong. They drew my blood, and did all these tests. However, they were never able to figure out what made me so sick. They gave me medication to help with my symptoms, and sent on my way. The medication worked, BUT, like most medications, it had side effects. The side effects created other problems, more symptoms. I had been taking the medication for almost a year when I got fed up. I thought, ""this isn't a normal life!"". I began to do research on my own and looked up foods that would alleviate my symptoms. It's been six years and all my symptoms are gone! I am off all medication! I haven't taken a pill for anything in years, not even for a cold.
 

The Nutrition Consultant Program

Bauman College's program ""provides students with in-depth knowledge of whole-foods nutrition as it contributes to the prevention of illness and the promotion of optimal health. By the completion of the program, students are prepared to work as nutrition professionals, providing expert evaluation of and recommendations for diet, target nutrients, and lifestyle that will support their future clients to or reverse the progression of chronic illness and obtain optimal health.""The program teaches fundamentals of nutrition: physiology, anatomy, macro- and micronutritient, and the effects on the body. Courses for the program include:
Term I
Eating for Health
Digestive Physiology
Biochemistry
Nutrition Analysis
Macronutrients
Micronutrients
Nutritional Counseling
 
Term IIStress + Endocrine Interactions
Men’s + Women’s Health
Liver Detoxification Gastrointestinal Health
Blood Sugar Regulation
Weight Management
Case Presentations
Clinical Assessment
Cardiovascular Health
Mental Health
Musculoskeletal Health +Sports Nutrition
Immune +Autoimmune
Cancer
https://www.baumancollege.org/programs/nutritio...Also integrated into the program's curriculum is Bauman's Business Institute to prepare students to work as nutrition professionals. Those classes include modules such as personal branding, defining a target market, social media building, food photography, writing a business plan.https://www.baumancollege.org/programs/nutrition-consultant/bbi-nutrition-consultant/

 

 


What We Need & What You Get
The break down in more detail:

My tuition for the program is $7944, and money raised above that goal would go to school related expenses like books, supplies, and food preparations.
All of the perks are from me, and designed around your special dietary restrictions.
If I don't reach my goal, I will still find a way to raise the rest of the tuition as I am determined to pursue this path.


Example of ingredients used in body card products. These are ingredients used for the face lotion.

The Impact

With the upward trend in clean eating, there is also lots of conflicting information that say ""eat that"" and later say ""don't eat that"". I will have the scientific knowledge to support and guide individuals on the diet that is right for them.
I will have knowledge (beyond food) to guide people to an overall healthy lifestyle.
This program will provide me with the tools to succeed at building a career focused on health.

<h3>Our Vision</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
The vision of FOR
Solutions is one of a world where soil is rich and fertile; where it is
sustained by the continuous replacement of vital nutrients derived from uneaten
food that has been converted into compost in a biologically and economically
efficient manner. A world where all uneaten food that came from the Earth
is returned to the Earth: a closed cycle where there is no beginning and more
important, no end. </p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
The mission of FOR
Solutions is to instigate the widespread adoption of local food scraps recovery
and recycling that will lead to the local production and distribution of
nutrient-dense, organically-produced food. FOR Solutions will accomplish
this by designing and marketing biologically and economically efficient,
aesthetically pleasing, value-engineered, aerobic, in-vessel, rotary drum food
scraps composting systems for local recovery and recycling of uneaten food. FOR
Solutions intends to make the practice of local, on-site food scraps recovery
and composting as commonplace as the now unsightly, smelly garbage dumpster for
the collection of discarded organic resources.</p>

<h3>Our Guiding Principles</h3>
<p>The guiding principles of FOR Solutions are:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>discarded, uneaten food is not waste until it is wasted; that is, if it is not composted so that the nutrients are recycled,</li>
<li>discarded, uneaten food is a vital, replenishable natural resource,</li>
<li>we are facing a global crisis related to degraded soil that can no longer grow the food we need,</li>
<li>revitalizing that soil using nutrient-dense compost made from uneaten food is the solution,</li>
<li>local, on-site composting is the most sustainable form of food scraps recovery and recycling, and</li>
<li>local production and distribution of nutrient-dense, organically-produced food is the most sustainable way to ensure food security.</li>

</div></div>","Introducing FOR Solutions







 

FOR Solutions designs and markets state-of-the-art aerobic, in-vessel rotary drum
digesters that transforms all food scraps (including meats, bones and shells)
along with other organics into a high-quality, nutrient-dense compost in just FIVE days.  It accomplishes this
with


virtually no odor,
no pests,
no leachate,
an energy-efficient process, and
an aesthetically-pleasing design.




Our Vision

The vision of FOR
Solutions is one of a world where soil is rich and fertile; where it is
sustained by the continuous replacement of vital nutrients derived from uneaten
food that has been converted into compost in a biologically and economically
efficient manner. A world where all uneaten food that came from the Earth
is returned to the Earth: a closed cycle where there is no beginning and more
important, no end. 


Our Mission

The mission of FOR
Solutions is to instigate the widespread adoption of local food scraps recovery
and recycling that will lead to the local production and distribution of
nutrient-dense, organically-produced food. FOR Solutions will accomplish
this by designing and marketing biologically and economically efficient,
aesthetically pleasing, value-engineered, aerobic, in-vessel, rotary drum food
scraps composting systems for local recovery and recycling of uneaten food. FOR
Solutions intends to make the practice of local, on-site food scraps recovery
and composting as commonplace as the now unsightly, smelly garbage dumpster for
the collection of discarded organic resources.

                 
Our Guiding Principles
The guiding principles of FOR Solutions are:


discarded, uneaten food is not waste until it is wasted; that is, if it is not composted so that the nutrients are recycled,
discarded, uneaten food is a vital, replenishable natural resource,
we are facing a global crisis related to degraded soil that can no longer grow the food we need,
revitalizing that soil using nutrient-dense compost made from uneaten food is the solution,
local, on-site composting is the most sustainable form of food scraps recovery and recycling, and
local production and distribution of nutrient-dense, organically-produced food is the most sustainable way to ensure food security.







What Do We Hope To Achieve? 




The FOR Solutions technology has proven that it is now poised to make a positive contribution to
the the next frontier of recycling: food scraps recovery.  We hope to
raise enough funds during this campaign to allow us to dedicate the amount of
time and efforts that will be necessary to commercialize fully this remarkable
technology.  We hope to change the way the world perceives food scraps
from one where they are considered worthless garbage to one where they are
considered a valuable, replenishable natural resource!

What We Need & What You Get
 
As a start-up company, we need capital to pay for operating and
manufacturing expenses.  We also need to educate and get the word out
about food scraps recovery and recycling. All of this requires your help.
FOR Solutions is proud to walk the walk as well as we talk the talk.
 You'll notice that our thank you gifts are consistent with the concept of
sustainability insofar as they include items made from 100% organic cotton and
contribute to environmentally responsible behaviors such as carrying a reusable
water bottle instead of a single-use disposable, plastic one.

On
top of our thank you gift, you'll also have the satisfaction of knowing that
you took positive action to support an effort that is designed to make the
world a better place by addressing one of the most pressing contemporary
environmental issues.  How to manage food scraps in a sustainable manner
is on the minds of almost everyone that is interested in sustainability.
  What About Climate Change? American generated 40 million tons of uneaten food in 2011, 97% of which was either landfilled or incinerated.  Both of these management options have serious negative environmental consequences, including contributing to climate change. Composting these food scraps is a vastly more sustainable option, especially when the composting is done locally on a small scale using the FOR Solutions technology!
If all of the uneaten food that is generated in America in just one year were to be composted using the FOR Solutions technology, the resultant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions would be roughly the same as if we removed millions of cars from the road!

What About Soil Revitalization?An area twice the size of the continental United States now has soil so badly degraded that it is unable to grow food as well as it could in the past.  With our ability to produce synthetic fertilizer decreasing due to peak oil and peak phosphorus, it is vital that we not waste the nutrients that are in uneaten food by burying or burning them.  We must transform uneaten food into nutrient-dense compost so that the compost may then be used as a soil amendment to restore vital nutrients to the soil.  Only then, will we have a sustainable food cycle!

Dr. Nick’s articles about on-site food scraps composting have appeared in publications such as Tech News, the Bulletin of the New Jersey Academy of Science, and Sociological Imagination. 
Articles about Dr. Nick’s demonstrations of the practicality of on-site aerobic in-vessel rotary drum food scraps composting efforts have appeared in New Jersey Monthly, E – The Environmental Magazine, and BioCycle as well as in several newspapers.

    


     

FOR Solutions Goes Global!
On September 25th, FOR Solutions signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Semarak Sinergi Sdn. Bhd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Malaysian Chamber of Commerce.  FOR Solutions CEO Ed Friedman (front right) and Semarak Executive Chairman Sabri Ahmed Tah (front left) signed the agreement in New York City in the presence of the Prime Minister of Malaysia (back center).  The agreement stipulates that FOR Solutions and Semark will collaborate to explore how the FOR Solutions technology will be the solution to food scraps management in Malaysia.

Other Ways You Can Help If you are unable to contribute to this campaign, perhaps you are able to post information about it on your social networks.  You can help advance the quest for sustainability by advocating for local food scraps recovery, local composting of those food scraps, and use of the compost locally to grow nutritious food that is distributed locally!

Even worse many of them have counter-productive effects for people that want to stay focused over longer periods.Because there was nothing else good in the market I decided to start to develop my own and honestly, the result is even better than what I have ever thought it would be.
We will make this happen and have gathered team from six various countries, fields and backgrounds. All to make sure you get your cans on time.

Currently we are in the final stage of development and are ready to produce whenever you are.All the money raised in this campaign is dedicated to the first production batch of eNgage & diseNgage.
 
Please join in or share this with a friend and make the first drink for gamers by gamers come true.",34.0,3,"1 Campaign

<p>ti.ttle is a wearable golf swing analyzer that mounts on your club. It senses your practice swing without the ball and calculates the carry distance and various attributes of your shots as though you actually hit the ball. Aside from helping you with these short games situations, ti.ttle allows you to practice your swing anywhere anytime. </p>
<p>Like a flight simulator helps pilots train without flying a plane, ti.ttle makes it possible for golfers to hone their game by getting the real-time feedback on the results of each practice swing. This allows you to practice your swing in the comfort of your home.</p>
<p>Also, ti.ttle connects via Bluetooth to your smart phone’s GPS and functions as a e-caddie on the course, pinpointing the distance left to the hole.</p>
<p>ti.ttle is a compact and powerful smart device that helps your game at practice and out on the course.</p>

<p>In December 2015, we launched the ti.ttle project through a successful crowdfunding effort. During the campaign, we quickly learned that a 3D swing simulation feature would really make this fantastic product. If we need to raise another $20,000, so we can add a 3D swing simulation function to our ti.ttle app that will show a 3D rendering of your swing in real-time. We are hard at work to improve the ti.ttle app constantly.

<ul> </ul> </div> <p><br/></p></div>","Hole 9, par 4, third stroke, 30 yards to the pin. Before you step up to strike the ball, you take a few practice swipes. Swing one, ti.ttle shows 52 yeards. Too long. Swing two, 17 yards. Too soft. Swing three, 29 yards. Go for it! With ti.ttle on your club, you know how your swing would do before you hit the ball.

1. Take a practice swing. 2. Check with ti.ttle if it's the right swing. 3. Go for it!
ti.ttle is a wearable golf swing analyzer that mounts on your club. It senses your practice swing without the ball and calculates the carry distance and various attributes of your shots as though you actually hit the ball. Aside from helping you with these short games situations, ti.ttle allows you to practice your swing anywhere anytime. 
Like a flight simulator helps pilots train without flying a plane, ti.ttle makes it possible for golfers to hone their game by getting the real-time feedback on the results of each practice swing. This allows you to practice your swing in the comfort of your home.
Also, ti.ttle connects via Bluetooth to your smart phone’s GPS and functions as a e-caddie on the course, pinpointing the distance left to the hole.
ti.ttle is a compact and powerful smart device that helps your game at practice and out on the course.

ti.ttle: A Flight Simulator for Golfers




•	I want to improve my touch in the short game.
•	I want to perfect my swing with every club.
•	I don’t have the time to get out to the driving range often enough. 
•	I want to practice in the comfort of my home. 
• I don’t want space-consuming and extravagant equipment cluttering my house. 
•	I want a simple easy-to-use device that analyzes my swing with every club. 
•	I want a versatile device that can also provide the course information as my e-caddie. 


ti.ttle is a smart and compact golf swing analyzer and an e-caddie all rolled into one. Many features are engineered into the intelligent little wearable device.
CARRY DISTANCE CALCULATOR
Immediately after a practice swing, ti.ttle calculates instantly the projected carry distance using an ingenious swing analysis algorithm. ti.ttle adapts to all club types—driver, wood, iron, wedge, and putter—to produce personalized and accurate swing data. After each practice swing, ti.ttle provides a real-time feedback by displaying the calculated carry distance on the device.  


Clubs Supported: Driver, Wood (3, 5, and 7), Long Iron (3 and 4), Middle Iron (5, 6, and 7), Short Iron (8 and 9), Wedge (Pitching wedge, Gap wedge, Sand wedge, and Lob wedge), and Putter.


REAL-TIME SWING ANALYSIS 


After you swing, tap the button on your ti.ttle device to display real-time swing data. The data includes: projected carry distance, head speed, swing type, club path, and face angle.
The ti.ttle swing algorithm can analyze 9 different swing types: pull hook, pull, pull slice, draw, straight, tail away fade, push hook, push and push slice.
Using a 6-axis MEMs (microelectromechanical) sensor, this small unobtrusive device will break down your swing and give you an immediate feedback so you can adjust your shot tendencies as you practice.
You can display all the attributes of your last swing right on your ti.ttle device with just one tap. Double-tap to switch to golf course information.




GOLF COURSE GPS INFO.


When connected to your smartphone through Bluetooth low energy (“BLE”), the ti.ttle app displays golf course information for over 36,000 courses worldwide. The current hole number and remaining distance to the hole is displayed automatically on your ti.ttle device.


Search for the golf course by country or course name on the ti.ttle app. Select the golf course through the app and automatically track your location on the course through GPS. Customize course settings to choose tee box, green, pin and distance measuring unit.


INDIVIDUALIZED CLUB SETTINGS 


Although ti.ttle can analyze your swing right out of the box, personal calibration gives you even more accurate swing analysis for each of your clubs. Individual club settings can be configured using the ti.ttle app. Once configured, the customized swing analysis data appear directly on your ti.ttle device. The ti.ttle app is not necessary during practice.
Record and compare your average carry distance for each club type. Know precisely which club to grab when you take to the field by tracking average distances.
You can record your new personal best and track your progress with the ti.ttle app.


CONVENIENCE FEATURES (Call Decline & Digital Clock)


While on the course, don’t let the calls distract you from your game. Decline phone calls and check missed text messages on the go with a simple tap on your ti.ttle. (These convenience features are only available for Android users. iPhone users will enjoy all other features except these.)


1. Preparation: Attach a cradle to each of your clubs and insert ti.ttle into the cradle.


2. App installation: Download the ti.ttle app from Google Play or Apple App Store. After installing the app, pair ti.ttle with your smart phone via Bluetooth.
3. Calibration (optional): Calibrate ti.ttle with each of the clubs. Put ti.ttle in calibration mode, hit the ball in the field, and enter the carry distance in the app.


4. Practice:  Put ti.ttle in practice mode, and swing the club without hitting the ball.

ti.ttle usage: on the course

ti.ttle usage: at home
5. View the results: If you swing, ti.ttle will display your swing data immediately. Click the button to scroll through your swing info.

<br/><h1>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h1>
<br/><h3>1. WHAT IS OVER EZ?</h3>Over EZ is an all natural dietary supplement specially formulated to help reduce the hang over effects of alcohol.<br/><br/><h3>2. HOW DO YOU TAKE OVER EZ?</h3>For best results, take 1 capsule with water sometime during alcohol consumption.<br/><br/><h3>3. HOW DOES IT HELP PREVENT HANGOVERS?</h3>In addition to dehydration, a primary cause of hangovers is the result of a toxin called acetaldehyde. Over EZ helps neutralize this toxin and supports the body to defuse it, therefore helping reduce the effects of a hangover by rapidly flushing out acetaldehyde from your body. Alcohol is a diuretic that causes the depletion of beneficial nutrients and vitamins from the body. One Over EZ capsule contains vitamin B2, vitamin B3, vitamin B5, vitamin B6 e vitamin B12, which together make up the B-complex vitamin. The vitamins in conjunction with minerals (magnesium and zinc), Amino acid (L-Cysteine) and others ingredients, such as chicory root extract, milk thistle extract, amla extract, chinese date extract, grape extract and beet juice may help restore balance to the body and can assist it in replenishing depleted nutrients resulting from alcohol consumption. The B-complex vitamin as well as many others nutrients are rapidly depleted from the body due to the diuretic effect of alcohol. The loss of these nutrients adversely affects the central nervous system, which creates the condition we all know as “the hangover.” Over EZ can help replenish these nutrients, thus potentially assisting the body in restoring its natural balance.<br/><br/><h3>4. WHO NEEDS OVER EZ?</h3>Occasional social drinkers and regular heavy drinkers are all subject to the harmful effects of alcohol. The toxin acetaldehyde is produced in the body right from the very first drink. So whether you are about to have mimosas at brunch or party the night away, you need Over EZ.<br/><br/><h3>5. WILL OVER EZ PREVENT INTOXICATION?</h3>No, Over EZ will not prevent intoxication and is not intended to treat or prevent the consequences of excessive alcohol consumption.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p> </p>
<p class=""p1""> After a near drowning experience about five years ago in  rather large surf, I came up with an idea of building an emergency supply of air into a wetsuit. That process has evolved into a design that not only provides emergency air, but distributes floatation in such a way as to increase swimming performance. a swimmer wearing this suit will now be able to swim faster through the water. It doesn't feel like you are wearing anything, you are just kind of suspended. My observation while snorkeling in Hawaii was this is what the astronauts must feel like when floating in space. </p>
<p class=""p2""> </p>
<p class=""p1"">My intended focus was to turn this into a surfing tool, but have discovered that there is an endless number of applications. Surfing, snorkeling, boating, rehabilitation, swimming pool recreation, military, river and lake recreation, etc. Designing the vets with food grade Poly urethane also adds the luxury of carrying edibles and drinkables. When inflated, the bladder can sustain a load of several thousand pounds (it could be literally be used a a car jack). </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> </p>
<p class=""p1"">By making people aware of our Vest, we hope to get the first vests into the hands of our contributors. This is the next big step for us, and you will be a part of the process that launches something that everyone will want to have. By contributing to our project you will make this happen a lot quicker.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>LinuxonAndroid is an on going project seeking to get Linux Distros running on as many Android devices as humanly possible! So far we have been able to get over 400+ known working ROM/Device combinations on over 200+ devices.</p>
<p>However, our own range of testing devices is very limited. I myself (The Lead Dev) am a University Student, and one of the other two devs is still in school, thus our income is very, very limited and we are unable to get extra devices.</p>
<p>This has been ok as we have been able to rely on the community to test and report working devices.</p>
<p><span>But it has come to a point where large bugs on certain devices are unable to be fixed, due to our lack of said devices. We cannot work on the bugs and test our solutions without the device itself to work on.</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This is simple, we need the funds to get the devices that need extra work - these devices will be bought second hand and as cheaply as possible. The more we raise, the more devices we can buy and the more devices we can 'officaly' support and test on!</p>
<p>This is the break down of what the money will go towards (subject to change*)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<del>First $250 Will go to buying an Atrix - This device currently has alot of issues with rendering the GUI on some ROMs, we need to know why!</del> Motorola have been kind enough to Donate a Atrix so we don't need to buy one!</li>
<li>First $325 will go to buying an <span>Samsung Galaxy Nexus - Being the flag ship google phone this should have offical support!</span>
</li>
<li><span>Next $80 will go towards buying a Motorola Lapdock to build a lapdock version of the images</span></li>
<li><span>Next $250 will go to buying a Nexus 7 - This device has a Tegra 3 processor which currectly can't render Unity correctly (and none of us have a tegra device!)</span></li>
<li><span>Next $500 will go to buying an <span>Asus Transformer Prime - with the keyboard and docking this is a device (and the other transformers) that will benfit from offical support so we can test and fix all the little bugs with the mouse etc.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>*This list is subject to change as we are talking with manufacturers to see if they will donate to the project, if this happens the list will be adjusted to reflect this</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Currently only 3-4 devices are 'officaly' supported. There are over 15,000 active LinuxonAndroid users, if everyone donationed just 10 cents we would be able to increase this list to 10+ devices!</p>
<p>Check out the perks to see what you can get extra for helping the fund!</p>

<p>Can't donate but want to help? Spread the word! Make some noise in the Android forums, let people know about the project and this fund raiser!</p>

<h3>UPDATE:</h3>
<h3>With all the donations coming in, Sarah is doing really well financially and we are no longer stressed out about her hospital bills. As of right now, we don’t need any more monetary donations, but if something changes in the future we will let you know! Thanks everyone who has donated money! She would not be doing so well without everyone’s help.<br/><br/>Who is Sarah and why does she need our help?</h3>
<p>Sarah is an English teacher in Korea. She is in the hospital with ulcerative colitis and blood clots. She has been in the hospital for over a month now and had two surgeries. She is actually having her third surgery as I write this now and her hospital bills are approaching 10 million Korean won (~$10000) with no end in sight.<br/><br/>In addition, she will be losing her job and with it her health insurance (UPDATE: Joseph Cutler was able to get her insurance extended! So, she has been able to keep her insurance!) because she has been sick so long and unable to work. So, her bills are only going to grow faster from here on out.<br/><br/>On top of all of this, Sarah's husband, Carlos, and her son, Balthazar, live in Colombia and have been unable to join Sarah in Korea. Their original plan was to come to Korea together, but at the last minute, Carlos had issues with getting a visa. They decided that Sarah would go ahead of the family and they would meet her in Korea. After many headaches and piles of costly paperwork, they were just a few weeks away from getting the visa when Sarah got sick.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need...</h3>
<p>Right now, we are just focusing on raising enough money to pay part or all of Sarah's hospital bills, but that's really just the tip of the iceberg. Depending on how well the fundraising goes, there is much more that could be done:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Medical Expenses:</strong> ~$12,000 (This is really only a guess. Hopefully she gets better soon!)</li>
<li>
<strong>Plane Ticket Back To England:</strong> $1200</li>
<li>
<strong>General Living Expenses:</strong> $2000 to help her while she convalesces and gets back on her feet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, that is being extremely optimistic. Right now, our main goal is to just make a dent in her hospital bills. If we manage to raise just $500, that would help a lot. If we manage to raise 15 or 20 thousand dollars, then maybe we can help reunite her family!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why You Should Donate To Sarah...</h3>
<p>Here is a little bit more information about Sarah and why you should donate to her:</p>
<ul>
<li>She is genuinely one of the nicest and most caring people I have ever met.</li>
<li>As a teacher, she has helped change the lives of children around the world from England to Colombia to Korea.</li>
<li>She is the sole supporter of her family back in Colombia.</li>
<li>While in Korea, she took on extra work to help teach for an Environment Awareness Program in rural schools to help teach children the importance of keeping our environment clean and using our resources wisely.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't afford to donate, then please spread the word! Persuading someone else to donate is just as good as donating yourself!</p>

I’ve helped build a powerful anti-nuclear organizing network on the west coast and begun building international grassroots collaboration around these issues.</p>
<p class=""p1"">My work visa is recently expired. I am currently in Japan while I attempt to apply for another visa.  I need funding to apply for a new internship visa for another year and half in order to keep my anti-nuclear activism through No Nukes Action. I am also offered an internship at Japan Pacific Resource Network (JPRN) where we will provide support the struggles of immigrants in North East disaster stricken area through bridging the US and Japan grassroots activism. Please help me stay in the United States for another year and a half to solidify these projects so they can continue to thrive and flourish without me. To these ends, I need to raise $5,000 to cover (most of) the costs of renewing my visa, and to do this I need your help! Please contribute to my efforts, a little bit helps, a lot is incredible!<br/><br/><strong>A Brief Summary of What I've Done between 2011 and 2012.</strong><br/>Please see the video above, and some links to my recent works and media appearance.</p>

This is both because of the direct health risk due to high levels of radiation (air, food, water) and the consistent government deception regarding the nuclear disaster. The government and the media continue to deny the risks people take everyday with actions as simply as gathering in the part or eating out. This affects me personally. I have a heritage in one of the nearby prefectures to Fukushima, Ibaraki. Radiation levels in my mother’s village are incredibly high. Earthquakes, although smaller than the March 2011 Earthquake, still threaten the region. The situation reminds me of Mississippi's after Hurricane Katrina, devastated, but largely overlooked. Still-occurring daily earthquakes keep people on edge, and more crucially, distracted from demanding evacuation from the nuclear contamination. <br/><br/> Everyday that I am in Japan I am forced to make decisions on where I will go, what I will speak out on. I grew up near the beach and spent many years appreciating the Pacific Ocean. However, the Fukushima accident has made being a beach bum impossible, undesirable, and, most importantly, a health risk. <br/><br/> People in Japan are currently trying to establish a legal force to demand compensation (similar to the case that occured after the Chernobyl accident). At the same time, everyone faces the day-to-day threat of exposure to both internal and external radiation. I foresee that Japan will soon be more ready to admit the seriousness of the generational effects of radiation due to Fukushima. <br/><br/> In the meantime, organizing here in California is helping me to determine how to strategize my next move in order to effectively work on anti-nukes causes eventually in Japan. Right now I believe that I can learn to become an even better “bridge” between Japan and the US by staying in the United States longer.<br/><br/> Ultimately I would like to evacuate my mother from the highly irradiated place where she lives, as well as my friends in Tokyo, but in order to do that, community education and solidarity are needed beyond Japan, which I feel confident in building.<br/><br/> I see Anti-nuclear work as an area to highlight the similarities between the United States and Japan in their lack of democratic process (in regard specifically to energy but not exclusively), as well as masked state violence which is shown through these environmental injustices!<br/><br/> The political impact of the Fukushima nuclear disaster affects multiple communities I've been part of, but their stories are their own and not mine to tell without their participation. I am still dealing with my own trauma from the earthquakes (I lost 7 of my friends in Miyagi Tsunami, and some part of my mother's district was also swiped away), but fortunately I have friends in California and in the places I've traveled and lived who can support my healing process. My own story is much smaller and easier than many, but the effects of the nuclear disaster the tsunami triggered have left me rootless, unwilling and unable to live in my own country, where radioactive contamination is immense and government deception around it is doubly terrifying. <br/><br/><strong>What I Want to Accomplish:</strong><br/> In the next year and half in the Bay Area, I will work on specific issues, solidifying the projects I’ve begun or helped build. I have 3 main ideas, all of which have to do with creating a both local and international network of Anti-Nuclear struggle:</p>
<ol>
<li class=""p1"">On the hyper-local level, I am interested in connecting the efforts of Anti-Nuclear activists and projects of the Bay Area. This includes connecting anti-Nuke work against Livermore Lab (trivalleycares.org, <a href=""http://www.wslfweb.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.wslfweb.org/</a>) to resistance at Diablo Canyon and San Luis Obispo(mothersforpeace.org). </li>
<li class=""p1"">On a semi-national level, I am interested in creating a broader network of connection between Anti-Nuclear resistance throughout local sites across the West Coast. This includes connecting resistance at the Hanford site (<a href=""http://nonukesnw.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://nonukesnw.wordpress.com/</a>) and its downwind/ downstream communities, as it is one of the most radiated sites in the world (<a href=""http://brainz.org/ten-most-radioactive-places-earth/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://brainz.org/ten-most-radioactive-places-earth/</a>) to the communities in San Onofre (near LA) resisting Nuclear power.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li class=""p1"">On the international level, I would like to build a bilingual website and produce a directory of anti-nukes communities in the US and in Japan that each of the communities can utilize as a resource to further connect and aid each others efforts.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li class=""p1"">In addition, I plan to build more survivor-led self-determination projectsin Immigrant communities in Japan through my work for Japan Pacific Resources Network (JPRN, <a href=""http://jprn.org/relief"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://jprn.org/relief</a>).</li>
</ol><p class=""p1""><strong>A Gift for you too!</strong><br/> As an experimental comic artist, I would like to produce more bilingual (or could be monolingual for this time!) comic strips to create an alternative narrative about what I see as an on-going nuclear slavery that will continue giving us generational PTSD. I am hoping that my activist work will inspire me to expand my artwork, and to create comic gifts for my supporters!</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>If I Don't Reach My Goal<br/></strong>There is a possibility that my visa application will be denied. According to some immigration experts, my experience as an independent learner (I quit schooling at the age 10, and worked and organized for self-taught education, queer issues, adult and immigrant literacy programs) might look like that I am not good enough to reenter the US. In Japan, I graduated high school equivalent of institution through corresponding course works, and only have a proper junior-high school diploma.</p>
<p class=""p1"">If my visa was denied at all, I would like to prepare myself to go back to the US as a tourist to do the anti-nukes reaserach projects (Hanford, Livermore or Diablo) in the West Coast with your support.</p>

<p> </p></div>","Short SummaryMy name is Umi Hagitani, and I am an anti-nukes activist who have been active in California since March 11th's Fukushima nuclear accident. I’ve helped build a powerful anti-nuclear organizing network on the west coast and begun building international grassroots collaboration around these issues.
My work visa is recently expired. I am currently in Japan while I attempt to apply for another visa.  I need funding to apply for a new internship visa for another year and half in order to keep my anti-nuclear activism through No Nukes Action. I am also offered an internship at Japan Pacific Resource Network (JPRN) where we will provide support the struggles of immigrants in North East disaster stricken area through bridging the US and Japan grassroots activism. Please help me stay in the United States for another year and a half to solidify these projects so they can continue to thrive and flourish without me. To these ends, I need to raise $5,000 to cover (most of) the costs of renewing my visa, and to do this I need your help! Please contribute to my efforts, a little bit helps, a lot is incredible!A Brief Summary of What I've Done between 2011 and 2012.Please see the video above, and some links to my recent works and media appearance.

<div>My friend Chrissy has a husband named Trevor with a very rare and extremely painful terminal cancer that has caused malignant tumors to spread all over his body. You can read about this cancer here:</div>
<div> </div>

<div> </div>
<div>The couple used to make trips once a month from Virginia just to fly down to Florida for chemo treatments at Moffitt Cancer Center because there is only 1 doctor in the whole state that treats this rare kind of cancer. However, the travel took its toll so they both decided to leave everything they have ever known, family and friends in their hometown in Virginia to make a giant move to the state of Florida so they can be closer to Moffitt Cancer Center.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Trevor has undergone many chemo treatments and very recently has been in the worst pain of his life and in and out of the hospital. They also just discovered 2 more tumors growing inside of his lungs. Everyday is a struggle for both Chrissy and Trevor. They are a couple entirely devoted to each other and found out of Trevor's cancer very shortly after their wedding day. They are both so young and have a whole life ahead of them but time seems to be of the essence. The struggle has gotten worse as the cancer progresses throughout his body. Each chemo treatment costs thousands of dollars that they cannot afford to pay.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In addition to struggling with treatment and doctors bills leaving them thousands of dollars in debt, they also now struggle with common household bills such as power in their house, cable, water, food, and gas etc. Each chemo treatment costs $20,000. To top it all off, Chrissy has tried to do everything she possibly can to help Trevor and her's financial situation and the little health insurance they did have is going to end. She has reached out to various different centers for funding (including Dr. Phil which she is waiting to hear back from) and has been rejected time and time again for no reason at all.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It breaks my heart to see someone suffer who doesn't deserve to. I have never met more generous people in my entire life, Chrissy and Trevor have taken care of me and my fiance and continue to do so. They watch our cat while we are away, they let us borrow things whenever we need, and they introduce us to new people and places in our new hometown. Overall they are extremely kind-hearted, true friends and they are always there willing to give a helping hand to me or anyone else in need, but now it is their time, and I want to help return the favor and send blessings and prayers their way.</div>

<p>Any offering and donation makes a world of difference, even if it is only a couple of dollars.

<p>The PNF is where we raise money for children with cancer, brain tumors, and life threatening diseases.</p>
<p><strong>Who I Am</strong></p>
<p>My name is Emmaleigh Butler and I am an A.L.L. Leukemia survivor. I know that children with sicknesses feel icky at times. Weak at times. And they just wanna give up. And that’s why I’m here. To let them know to keep going no matter what! I want to give them hope. I want them to follow their dreams! I want them to fight. So I am going to raise money for the ill children. Visit them in the hospital! Give them gifts. Keep in mind that I am just starting off. I have not covered too many children. I am trying my best though! The children that I am starting off with are the children in Arizona.</p>
<p>            This cause is important to me because I want to let the kids know that it will all be okay, no matter what. I know I wanted to give up… So many times! But the people in my life made it better. Made me believe! I want to be that person in their lives. That person that makes them believe.</p>
<p>            <strong>What your donations will help me achieve is:</strong></p>
<p>A 501(c)(3)</p>

<p>Outcomes:</p>
<p>Two years ago at our first soccer camp in Leon, Nicaragua VL was able to donate 20 soccer balls, 40 cleats and 50 jerseys and shorts. The camp had 40 percent girl participants and 60 percent boy participants that were living in Leon. Of the seven U.S. participants, four were girls and three were boys. This year our goal is to increase the number of participants from Nicaragua as well as the U.S. and increase the percentage of female participants to be 50 percent from both groups.</p>

<h2>J o s h began with Mud</h2>
<p>Hi! I am Joshua Nece, creator of J o s h Skincare. As a long term sufferer of eczema I personally had the need to create skincare products that would not only alleviate my eczema but also help heal and keep in control. Years ago when living in San Francisco I was introduced to the idea of infusing oils with medicinal plants and herbs. Seeing almost immediate results I started learning everything I could about plants, herbs, essential oils, and anything else that came from the earth that had medicinal qualities for the skin, and started creating products for my personal use. The first product being the Mud mask. After gifting the Mud to some friends, they started encouraging me to actually create a business with these products because they loved the way it made their skin look and feel. In a word: glowy!</p>
<p>So, in 2015 I launched J o s h Skincare in Downtown Los Angeles with a line of 4 skincare products, beeswax candles and incense. I started this venture with an idea, passion, a truck load of determination, and by maxing out all my credit cards. Truly a passion project, as I gave it my everything. The first launch was well received, selling out at events, boutiques, and on Amazon.  I quickly understood their was a return clientele that truly loved the products. So now I am taking all the knowledge and skill from the past four years and restoring the J o s h foundation by creating new products and fine-tuning all procedures. I plan on relaunching J o s h in Palm Springs Ca, with the desire to take J o s h to the next level.  </p>
<h3>The Goal</h3>
<p>I have set the goal to relaunch J o s h at $35,000 </p>
<p>By relaunching with capital behind me I will be able to take some major steps to grow this business:</p>
<p>-Proper Production Space- I will have an ample space to to manufacture and store supplies will allow me to buy materials in bulk quantities and ensure efficiency and consistency in my products. </p>
<p>-Equipment- I will be able to buy equipment so I can produce the products in greater scale. For example: mixers, heat plates, wax warmers, 2 stills (to make my own hydrolsols that are used in products), a die cut machine and a printer. </p>
<p>-Materials- I will be able to restock all the raw ingredients I use at the highest quality and able to buy in bulk prices, bringing down overall costs and making for better price points and profit margins.</p>
<p>-Assistant- I will be able to hire an assistant at 20 hours a week, allowing me to produce more and get the product to more events and in more shops. </p>
<p>-Marketing- I will be able pay for advertising through Amazon, Google, and Instagram </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact of your investment is huge for J o s h  to really take the next step in scaling up and becoming a major brand. With this capital I will take the brand to the ultimate level and J O S H will be found on the shelves of stores like Sephora and Ulta.</p>
<p>Continuing J o s h for me is a personal dream. Everything I have experienced and learned through doing this project has had a huge impact on my personal life. It has shown me how creative and strong I actually am. I have learned that I am a very capable person and can rely on my own passions. I have felt empowered through all of this process which has been amazing and new for me. What used to hinder me (my eczema) has become the very thing that drives me to push further. It is amazing and I feel I've only just begun.</p>

Hi! I am Joshua Nece, creator of J o s h Skincare. As a long term sufferer of eczema I personally had the need to create skincare products that would not only alleviate my eczema but also help heal and keep in control. Years ago when living in San Francisco I was introduced to the idea of infusing oils with medicinal plants and herbs. Seeing almost immediate results I started learning everything I could about plants, herbs, essential oils, and anything else that came from the earth that had medicinal qualities for the skin, and started creating products for my personal use. The first product being the Mud mask. After gifting the Mud to some friends, they started encouraging me to actually create a business with these products because they loved the way it made their skin look and feel. In a word: glowy!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello Friends, Aaron Lerner here.  If we don't already know each other, I am 34 years old, born in Kansas City, MO, live in KCMO, and am creator of the Doc Lerner Quality Goods speciality line of all-natural, handmade skin products.  </p>
<p>At age nine I was diagnosed with severe plaque psoriasis. This was the first major turning point in my life. It forced me to start paying attention, closely examine and become a student of the body's largest organ--the skin--from a very early age.  The older I got, the more passionate I became about learning everything I could about skin. Specifically, how, what and why one's skin might react in adverse ways.  After more than 20+ years of dedicated research, personal experience, and extensive study, these carefully-crafted products were born out of need. They represent the culmination of my life's work in this area (thus far), and for that reason, this campaign is more than simply <i>important</i>; it is <i>necessary</i>.  </p>
<p>It can't be done alone, however.  Hence, the creation of this site, and the hope of earning enough trust, product belief and excitement among friends, family and anyone else who sees the need for these products to gain your support. </p>
<p>Put simply, I need believers: people who see the potential, and have the desire to play an integral part in bringing these one-of-a-kind products to the people of Kansas City and beyond.  Whether a small financial donation is something you have the ability to contribute, or not, you can still help simply by passing the word along to a friend who might be interested.  This can be every bit as helpful, and is certainly equally appreciated.</p>
<p>With your assistance, we have the chance to turn this project into something big.  The feedback has been thorough and outstanding.  If you can part with a few bucks--no more than the price of a latte at Starbuck's--you could potentially help improve the lives of thousands of people, while also taking pride in knowing that you had an integral role in helping turn this dream into a reality.  And for that, I will forever be grateful!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<ul>
<li>In order to take this project to the next level, a team of creative and talented professionals must be brought in.  That said, I have chosen to work with the great people at Utilitarian Workshop, a small marketing and brand development company that specializes in handmade goods. I am confident that with their help, and yours, we will be able to bring Doc Lerner's Quality Goods to a store near you, wherever you may live!</li>
<li>The plan has already been set in place, and will compose of three phases, each of which will cost approximately $3,500--hence the $10,000 goal.  The first phase will consist of refining the concept, the brand and the visual direction.  Phase two will take care of all print and collateral development, and phase three is for web design and development.  It goes without saying that all of these things are extremely important--essential, in fact--for any small business hoping to expand.</li>
<li>If the $10,000 goal is not reached, any effort--whether financial, or by simply spreading the word--will not be wasted.  Anything and everything helps, and every penny raised will be used for nothing other than to get this project launched!</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Besides playing an integral role in advancing what has been a lifelong process for me, your contribution goes much further than that.  Whether you knew my dad as a patient, friend, colleague or acquaintance; or only knew of him through one of his five children or other family members, his legacy was a powerful one and should be kept alive.  By further educating people on health, well-being, and offering products that will improve complexion, address various chronic conditions and enhance natural beauty, the intention is to do just that. </li>
<li>The bottom line is that I have taken this as far as I possibly can on my own.  With banks not interested in lending money to ventures as important as this one, the impact that each individual can make is much greater than they could ever know.</li>
<li>To learn more about this project, see the products, and get more information on the unique niche that has been hit upon, please visit etsy.com/shop/DocLerner, or Like us on Facebook at facebook.com/DocLerner. There you will find everything needed to know exactly what sets us apart from the thousands of other skin care products that currently exist and why there is a need for products such as these.  As I like to remind people, ""Burt knows Bees.  Doc knows Skin.""</li>

<p>Some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help:</p>

<li>Remember to use the Indiegogo share tools to help make spreading the news as simple as could be!</li>
<li>Our goal is to get 1,000 people to donate an average of $10 each.  So if you can only donate $5, not only will your donation be as valued and appreciated as any other, but maybe you know someone else who might be able to donate $15.</li>

<p>We
are a team of engineers and prosthetic practitioners from Johns Hopkins
University. We are designing a low-cost prosthesis to improve rehabilitation
and mobility for amputees in the developing world. It’s not just about making a
cheaper device. We want a solution that fits patients’ lives and gives them the
freedom to do the things they want and need to do.</p>
<p><b>THE NEED</b></p>
<p>Globally,
there are 10 million amputees, and that number is increasing. Every year, over
100,000 below-knee amputees alone are added to that number. However, <b>80%
of people who need a prosthesis cannot obtain one</b>. In the developing world,
many civilians live with disabilities as a result of war, conflict, and vehicle
accidents.  They are unable to work and participate as integral members of
family and society because of their lack of mobility and social stigma.</p>
<p>The
<b>socket </b>– the component that directly contacts the patient’s limb – is the <b>most
important part</b> of a prosthesis. If the socket doesn’t fit, the entire
prosthesis is useless. Molding an intimately fitting socket requires training
and often special equipment only available at prosthetic clinics. As a
patient’s limb changes over time, the socket that once fit can become painful,
but it is difficult to make these adjustments without an entirely new
prosthesis. Patients need 15-20 devices in a lifetime to accommodate these
physical changes and wear-and-tear. In low-resource settings, where many people
are below the poverty level, the cost is prohibitive due to the long distances
to prosthetic clinics, expensive components, and limited trained personnel.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/482752/files/20140403213933-children_amputees.png?1396586373"" src="""" style=""width: 352px; height: 396px;""/></p><p><b>OUR SOLUTION</b></p>
<p>We
have designed a <b>low-cost and easily adjustable below-knee prosthesis</b>.
The unique material we are using for the socket can be shaped and re-shaped so
that the fit can be modified as the patient’s limb changes over time. Most of
the components can be purchased locally, making repairs and adjustments
convenient and affordable. With our method, the time to make a prosthesis can
be reduced from weeks or days to hours, so patients and the technicians making
their prosthetic devices can be more productive members of society.</p>
<h4><b><i>What You Can Do</i></b></h4>
<p>In
the next year, we’re heading to Guatemala, India, and Nigeria to share our
device with partners in the field to get real end-user feedback on our device
and learn more about organizations and health networks already in place. Here
are our objectives:</p>
<p>1) Speak
with health officials, physicians, physical therapists, prosthetic technicians,
social workers, patients, and other people that are affected directly and indirectly
by amputation and disability to <b>expand local networks</b> and <b>assess
customer needs</b>.</p>
<p>2) <b>Fit
10-20 patients</b> in each region and <b>train local technicians</b> to
use our fabrication process so we can introduce our idea. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/482770/files/20140403214753-joel_sheryl.png?1396586873"" src="""" style=""width: 433.00000000000006px; height: 326px;""/></p><p>Your
generous donations will help us travel to these locations so we can move one
step closer to our goal of bringing affordable prosthetic care to those who
don’t currently have access. Most of the funds will go towards airfare and in-country
housing, but we also need to bring materials with us so we can fit people with
our device. <b>Every dollar counts!</b></p>
<p>To
give you a sense of our costs:</p>
<p><b>$25 = 1 prosthetic socket</b></p>
<p><b>$75 = 1 whole prosthesis</b></p>
<p><b>$150 = 5 prosthetic feet</b></p>
<p><b>$500 = All in-country transportation in Guatemala and India</b></p>
<p><b>$1000 = 10 whole prosthetic devices + technician training</b></p>
<p><b>$2000 = 1 roundtrip to Guatemala for 2 team members
(airfare+housing)</b></p>
<p>Here
are the funding benchmarks that we need to reach:</p>
<p>1) Raise <b>$3,500</b> to
pay for our airfare, in-country transportation, prosthetic devices, and
technician training for our entire <b>Guatemala</b> campaign in <b>Fall
2014</b></p>
<p>2) Raise <b>$5,000 </b>for

<p>3) Anything
raised above $<b>8,500 </b>will go towards our trip to <b>Nigeria </b>in <b>Summer
2015</b></p>
<p>*4%
of the donations will go to Indiegogo for running this service, but <b>100%
of the remaining funds </b>will go towards materials and travel expenses
specifically for these three trips. No member of our team will be receiving
income or administrative fees.</p><p> </p>

prosthetic leg does not just affect the individual who wears it. A prosthesis
is part of a greater system. A ten-year-old child with a prosthesis can return

longer needs around-the-clock care, so the parents can work without worrying
about who will watch him. The child will grow up and get a better job than he
would have without a leg because of his education. </p><p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">Your

of the remaining funds will go towards materials and travel expenses
specifically for these three trips. No member of our team will be receiving
income or administrative fees. 
What You Get
To thank you for your
donation, we will keep you updated on our project via updates on our Facebook page. We also want to support local members of the communities that we visit,
so we will be sending you hand-made artisan crafts. 
Your Impact
A
prosthetic leg does not just affect the individual who wears it. A prosthesis
is part of a greater system. A ten-year-old child with a prosthesis can return
to school, participate in sports, and help out his siblings. The child no
longer needs around-the-clock care, so the parents can work without worrying
about who will watch him. The child will grow up and get a better job than he
would have without a leg because of his education. Your
support will help thousands of people around the globe regain their mobility
and independence.Other Ways You Can Help

That system will send out text alerts to Track Members near the anomaly, to alert them that something has been detected nearby, perhaps headed in their direction. This should provide an opportunity to quickly go outside (camera or binoculars in hand) and ""look up"" to see if there is anything in the sky.

<h3>Short Summary of Amputee Blade Runners</h3>
<p>Amputee Blade Runners (ABR) is a non profit organization based out of Nashville Tennessee that provides amputees with complete running prosthetics free of charge, so these individuals are able to regain active lifestyles.  This is a need of many amputees, because running prosthetics are not covered by insurances.  Our goal is to provide running prosthetics to at least one athlete in all 50 states by the end of 2015. </p>
<p>Ryan Fann and Aaron Fitzsimmons are both very passionate individuals and chose to combine this passion with their expertise in prosthetics, founding Amputee Blade Runners in 2011. Aaron's desire for helping people began with Camp Easter Seals organization during his undergraduate college experience.  The reward of helping others continued early on in a career as an Occupational Therapist.  He then teamed up with Ronney Snell, and former president of the American Orthotic and Prosthetic Association and served as a prosthetic technician, before going on to become a certified prosthetist.  Ryan Fann is a certified prosthetist (CP) and has a bachelors in Business Administration. Ryan’s journey into prosthetics, however, started when he was three years old and was run over while riding his big wheel in his neighborhood resulting in losing his left leg below the knee. Ryan went on to play as a starting linebacker for his high school.  When playing in a TN all star game, a prosthetic company offered to make him a running leg and Ryan then went on to run track at Tennessee State University (TSU) on a scholarship competing with able bodied athletes, the first to do so in TN. Ryan then ran with the US Paralympic track program earning Gold and Bronze medals in the Athens Paralympic Games.  Together, Ryan Fann and Aaron Fitzsimmons have helped over thirty athletes in eight states get back to running and sports, at collegiate, high-school, and recreational levels, who also serve as ambassadors to other amputee athletes as a part of ABR.</p>

<h3>West Coast Outreach Campaign</h3>
<div>LA residents Bo Burroughs and Brittany Burke, siblings of Ryan Fann and Brandon Burke, are teaming up to launch the West Coast Outreach of Amputee Blade Runners to help them reach their goal of having an amputee from every state!  On Sunday, November 17th, a red carpet Hollywood event will celebrate this expansion.<br/>
</div>
<p>In November of 2007, my brother, Brandon Burke, was diagnosed with a rare form of bone cancer, Ewing's Sarcoma.  At the time of discovery, the cancer had progressed to stage three and spread to the bone marrow.  After undergoing an experimental study at the National Institute of Health and nine months of intense chemotherapy, Brandon decided to amputate his leg in July of 2009 due to surgery complications, in order to return to an active lifestyle.  After going off to college and trying to remain active, Brandon was introduced to Ryan Fann who was in the process of starting Amputee Blade Runners. Ryan saw that Brandon was trying to play full-court basketball at his school's rec center, but was unable to properly do so in a walking prosthesis, one that he continually broke. Ryan provided Brandon with his running prosthetic and the expertise needed to make it work, as well as serving as his trainer and mentor.  As an Amputee Blade Runners board member, he now serves as a running coach to above the knee amputees and competes in half-marathons and olympic distance triathlons.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p></p>
<p>We are in need of $25,000 funding to reach our goal of providing at least five amputees with stories similar to Ryan and Brandon's with complete running prosthetics.  These resources have the capability to change an individual's life and continue on to help others in need. The unique proposition of Amputee Blade Runners is in the combination of resources, expertise, and passion that allow for us to help amputees get active at the highest of levels at a cost that is as low as possible. Your donation will help change someone's life.</p>
<p>While our goal is to fully fund five individuals, if we do not reach our full $25,000 goal, all proceeds will still benefit as many recipients as possible.  </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Amputee Blade Runners is a powerful organization which changes people's lives and quality of living.  While health insurance does not cover the costs of running prosthetics and costs are extremely high, ABR makes an active lifestyle a reality.  Based out of Nashville Tennessee, Bo Burroughs and Brittany Burke are determined to spread awareness and support to enable the organization to grow.</p>

<p>Over the past 40 years, Dr. Jones has treated more than 15,000 children and adolescents, from countries where many thought Lyme did not exist, including China, Australia, even Saudia Arabia.</p>
<p>At age 82, Dr. Jones is relentless in his quest to get these children well. He works 6 days a week. And sleeps only 4 or 5 hours a night. During his ""free"" time, Dr. Jones reviews stacks of notes and charts on ""his kids"" (patients). He says, he has no time to rest, there are simply too many sick kids coming through his door. (He is one of only a handful of pediatricians in the U.S. trained, specifically, in treating Lyme Disease.)</p>

<h3><strong>A Brief History - </strong></h3>
<p>Dr. Jones is one of the ""founding"" physicians heavily involved in treating the disease when it was ""discovered"" in Connecticut in the 1960's. </p>
<p>Despite extreme pressure from outside medical entities, including supporters of IDSA (Infectious Disease Society of America), Dr. Jones has held true to his convictions, determined to properly diagnose and treat children with Lyme Disease. </p>
<p>Before anyone heard of Lyme Disease, Dr. Jones had begun treating a growing number of children suffering with disabling arthritic pain. They were being diagnosed with Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis (JRA). But, almost by accident, Dr. Jones discovered that by treating these patients with high doses of antibiotics, their arthritis would disappear. When he stopped antibiotics (prematurely), the symptoms would return. He decided if the patient fit the ""clinical diagnosis"" of Lyme Disease, he would  continue antibiotics until ALL symptoms COMPLETELY resolved, regardless of how long it took.  It worked, children got better. Today, he continues this ""unconventional"" treatment plan. (His opponents believe in treating with antibiotics for only a brief, few weeks, even if symptoms are still present.)</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">I worked for a company that was trying to use magnets to target drugs for cancer.  We made tiny particles that could absorb cancer drugs and were also metallic.  You could put the particles into someone’s blood vessels, then hold them in a cancer tumor using a giant magnet.  This allowed the drug to sit in the tumor and not circulate around the patients’ body.  It was a good idea; Chemotherapy drugs are very toxic and it would be nice if they could just stay in a tumor and not kill healthy tissues. There are some publications listed below that describe the detailed science of the process.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The idea seemed to work well and carried through a clinical trial.  It was even orphaned by the FDA, meaning, they would allow for a faster review process because the idea was so promising.  </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The company expanded a bit and held a bigger clinical trial, and the particles stopped working.  The company folded.  It was thought that there was something going-on between the particles and the cancer drug that was unpredictable chemically.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">I moved-on to other projects and mostly forgot about the particles.  Later, I became a mother and taught science at a small school.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Thirteen years after the company folded, I was sitting in my school laboratory watching a physics student of mine play with a magnet and some iron filings.  I suddenly completely understood what had happened to make the original clinical trial work, and the latter trial fail; it was a “Eureka” moment.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Days later I was at a friend's house, visiting, while our kids played and she showed me Amanda Palmer's TED Talk.  I was inspired.  I realized I needed to get this information out of my head and into the world. I was the only one who knew it. If I'm right, this could have a huge effect on future cancer treatment therapies.</p>

<h3 dir=""ltr""> </h3>
<h3 dir=""ltr"">My Idea</h3>
<p>If you play with a magnet and some iron filings in a see-through container, you will notice that the iron aggregates into sharp little pointy spears as you move the magnet close.  When you move the magnet away gently, the spears fall back apart into particles.  Imagine that the iron particles are inside a blood vessel, inside a tumor, aggregating and falling apart.  My idea is that this physical action tears-up the blood vessel, and destroys the tumor.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The evidence for this is that during the original clinical trial with the particles (see history, above), the magnet was held over the patient for a long period of time.  No one knew how long would be necessary, so we had the patient stay under the magnet for an hour or more.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Then, some laboratory research made us believe that only a few minutes of “magnet time” was required for the particles to work their way into the tumor and stay there.  So, for the trial that did not work, the magnet was only applied for ten minutes.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">If the aggregate spears were destroying the tumors, these results make sense.  It also makes sense that in the successful trial, tumors that were removed from patients after treatment appeared “torn up” inside.  In the successful trial (in some cases), patients with tumors that were too large to remove shrank and were removed surgically, saving the patients’ lives.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">(An unedited animation of the science portion of the video is posted under the ""Updates"" tab)</p>
<h3><span>What the Money is For</span></h3>
<p dir=""ltr"">The money for this campaign will go for an initial laboratory investigation of my idea.  My hope is that the science will be strong enough to publish the results, and perhaps to interest additional scientists and investigators.  I need a minimum level of funding to initiate pre-clinical trials of the concept at two certified labs.  I will also need to purchase a rare earth magnet with the strength of the one used in the old clinical trials, uniform sized iron particles, and a few other small items and chemicals.  The testing will be in vitro (t<span>aking place in a test tube, culture dish, or elsewhere outside a living organism)</span> which means, of course, no living organism will be used or harmed.</p>
<h3><strong>Why do we only need $11k? Isn't medical research astronomically expensive?</strong></h3>
<div><strong> </strong></div>
<div>This is just the first step, the proof of concept if you will.  If the initial testing proves correct, we'll move on to toxicology testing, assay developement, tox batch production, and so on and and that's where costs go up.  This project gets the ball rolling. Anyone who signs up now will continue to be in the loop on the news of further testing, patent progress, future research funding and investment updates.</div>
<h3 dir=""ltr"">Why You Should Help</h3>
<p dir=""ltr"">If I am correct, this technology could potentially help anyone with a solid tumor cancer (that is nearly all cancers except leukemia and lymphoma).</p>
<p dir=""ltr""> </p>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><strong>What You Get</strong></h3>
<p><strong><br/></strong>We've listed some incentives on the side. Mostly we're trying to make this fun for people who aren't ""Sciency"" but when it comes down to it, everyone has been touched by cancer.

<div>People have sent in great private questions!  I'm going to answer them in public.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>Do you have access to a lab facility?</strong><br/>I have three possible labs for in-vitro and organ modeling of the idea; I will get results from two. These are experienced contract pre-clinical labs where I (or friends) have done work.  In-vitro and preclinical results would allow me to take it back to physicians who used the 2001 system that has some similarities.</div>

<div>
<strong>What is your background and relevant experience?</strong><br/>My background is in Biology, Tox, and most heavily in Project Management for big pharma. I’ve taken several drugs from idea through Phase III.  My most relevant experience for this idea is from design and validation of preclinical testing and assays of a similar product.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Although I have a $150,000 certification in making drug products commercial, my best experience for this was having my hands in the lab at the very beginning of an idea (see publications).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I would (obviously) not act as the PI; I have dual PIs in Tox and Physics interested, and a doctor in mind. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>Do you have a patent?</strong><br/>I filed a patent the night I had the idea; it does not infringe on earlier patents as my mechanism is completely different from the earlier proposal.  The budget allows for completion of the patent process.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>Why use crowd funding?</strong><br/>The normal financial process at this stage is to seek investors who would like to profit from the drug.  The other normal thing is to keep it a complete secret until you have something wonderful to tell the press.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The problem is this.  Once you bring-in someone trying to profit from the drug, you are on a timeline of financial milestones that lead to an IPO or commercialization.  Science does not often fit that timeline.  This idea is a classic example. </div>

<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>","The History of My Idea
I worked for a company that was trying to use magnets to target drugs for cancer.  We made tiny particles that could absorb cancer drugs and were also metallic.  You could put the particles into someone’s blood vessels, then hold them in a cancer tumor using a giant magnet.  This allowed the drug to sit in the tumor and not circulate around the patients’ body.  It was a good idea; Chemotherapy drugs are very toxic and it would be nice if they could just stay in a tumor and not kill healthy tissues. There are some publications listed below that describe the detailed science of the process.
The idea seemed to work well and carried through a clinical trial.  It was even orphaned by the FDA, meaning, they would allow for a faster review process because the idea was so promising.  
The company expanded a bit and held a bigger clinical trial, and the particles stopped working.  The company folded.  It was thought that there was something going-on between the particles and the cancer drug that was unpredictable chemically.
I moved-on to other projects and mostly forgot about the particles.  Later, I became a mother and taught science at a small school.
Thirteen years after the company folded, I was sitting in my school laboratory watching a physics student of mine play with a magnet and some iron filings.  I suddenly completely understood what had happened to make the original clinical trial work, and the latter trial fail; it was a “Eureka” moment.
Days later I was at a friend's house, visiting, while our kids played and she showed me Amanda Palmer's TED Talk.  I was inspired.  I realized I needed to get this information out of my head and into the world. I was the only one who knew it. If I'm right, this could have a huge effect on future cancer treatment therapies.

My Idea
If you play with a magnet and some iron filings in a see-through container, you will notice that the iron aggregates into sharp little pointy spears as you move the magnet close.  When you move the magnet away gently, the spears fall back apart into particles.  Imagine that the iron particles are inside a blood vessel, inside a tumor, aggregating and falling apart.  My idea is that this physical action tears-up the blood vessel, and destroys the tumor.
The evidence for this is that during the original clinical trial with the particles (see history, above), the magnet was held over the patient for a long period of time.  No one knew how long would be necessary, so we had the patient stay under the magnet for an hour or more.
Then, some laboratory research made us believe that only a few minutes of “magnet time” was required for the particles to work their way into the tumor and stay there.  So, for the trial that did not work, the magnet was only applied for ten minutes.
If the aggregate spears were destroying the tumors, these results make sense.  It also makes sense that in the successful trial, tumors that were removed from patients after treatment appeared “torn up” inside.  In the successful trial (in some cases), patients with tumors that were too large to remove shrank and were removed surgically, saving the patients’ lives.
(An unedited animation of the science portion of the video is posted under the ""Updates"" tab)
What the Money is For
The money for this campaign will go for an initial laboratory investigation of my idea.  My hope is that the science will be strong enough to publish the results, and perhaps to interest additional scientists and investigators.  I need a minimum level of funding to initiate pre-clinical trials of the concept at two certified labs.  I will also need to purchase a rare earth magnet with the strength of the one used in the old clinical trials, uniform sized iron particles, and a few other small items and chemicals.  The testing will be in vitro (taking place in a test tube, culture dish, or elsewhere outside a living organism) which means, of course, no living organism will be used or harmed.
Why do we only need $11k? Isn't medical research astronomically expensive?
 
This is just the first step, the proof of concept if you will.  If the initial testing proves correct, we'll move on to toxicology testing, assay developement, tox batch production, and so on and and that's where costs go up.  This project gets the ball rolling. Anyone who signs up now will continue to be in the loop on the news of further testing, patent progress, future research funding and investment updates.
Why You Should Help
If I am correct, this technology could potentially help anyone with a solid tumor cancer (that is nearly all cancers except leukemia and lymphoma).
 
What You Get
We've listed some incentives on the side. Mostly we're trying to make this fun for people who aren't ""Sciency"" but when it comes down to it, everyone has been touched by cancer. We'll get stickers, t-shirts, if we go over our goal we'll come up with some more stretch-goal, fun, goodies.  But mostly this is to help move us toward a possible, better, treatment of cancer.
 


FAQ 
People have sent in great private questions!  I'm going to answer them in public.
 

Do you have access to a lab facility?I have three possible labs for in-vitro and organ modeling of the idea; I will get results from two. These are experienced contract pre-clinical labs where I (or friends) have done work.  In-vitro and preclinical results would allow me to take it back to physicians who used the 2001 system that has some similarities.
 

What is your background and relevant experience?My background is in Biology, Tox, and most heavily in Project Management for big pharma. I’ve taken several drugs from idea through Phase III.  My most relevant experience for this idea is from design and validation of preclinical testing and assays of a similar product.
 
Although I have a $150,000 certification in making drug products commercial, my best experience for this was having my hands in the lab at the very beginning of an idea (see publications).
 
I would (obviously) not act as the PI; I have dual PIs in Tox and Physics interested, and a doctor in mind. 
 

Do you have a patent?I filed a patent the night I had the idea; it does not infringe on earlier patents as my mechanism is completely different from the earlier proposal.  The budget allows for completion of the patent process.
 

Why use crowd funding?The normal financial process at this stage is to seek investors who would like to profit from the drug.  The other normal thing is to keep it a complete secret until you have something wonderful to tell the press.
 
The problem is this.  Once you bring-in someone trying to profit from the drug, you are on a timeline of financial milestones that lead to an IPO or commercialization.  Science does not often fit that timeline.  This idea is a classic example. 
 
When we initially tested the carrier product in the lab, the results did not support the mechanism that was proposed.  Even at that early stage, people were fired for suggesting we take some more time and investigate.  After the original successful clinical trial, no one was interested in anything but sticking-to the financial timeline of the project.  So, the second trial failed, as do many trials.  I believe this paradigm is holding back technology in medicine.
 
That is why I’m making an effort to keep this grassroots, transparent, and non-profit.  I have determined that cancer, and other diseases, are simply too important to entrust to the current system.  I hope we can set a precedent for funding the actual scientific process.

<p><strong>Choroideremia is a genetic eye disease that is slowly stealing away the sight of those who suffer from it, like myself and thousands of other men (and some women) in the US and thousands more around the world.</strong></p>
<p><strong>People who suffer from Choroideremia (or CHM for short) are missing a gene that produces something called REP-1 protein.  This protein supplies nourishment for the photo-receptor cells of the choroid layer of the retina.  Without if, those cells slowly die off.  The eyesight and peripheral vision of the person with CHM slowly deteriorates until complete blindness is the final result.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It does not have to be that way if you help.  There are many exciting avenues of research being explored right now for this disease.  Phase one clinical trials are already underway in the UK and some are planned for the very near future in the US.  All that is missing is funding.  </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Our group, the Choroideremia Research Foundation, has vowed to raise around $3 million dollars in the next few years, and every single dollar counts.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>If you donate to this campaign, every single one of those dollars will go the CRF, and the money they get goes right to the research teams they are funding, including Dr. Jean Bennett at the University of Pennsylvania and Dr. Miguel Seabra and his team in the UK and others.  This campaign is just a small way to contribute to this amount.</strong></p>

I watched in awe as his surfing friends pushed him into scary waves in Ventura, California.</p><p>I immediately knew that others needed electric assist technology more than I did. That realization, plus years of engineering innovations, resulted in  the world’s first joystick-controlled, steerable electric surfboard. Using this board  at a Malibu beach test session in June 2012, the  young surfer was able to surf independently again. He caught a lot of waves, hung out in the surf for over an hour, and even used the electric assist board to tow his buddies!</p><p>Below are pictures of Julia Olson (who sustained a spinal cord injury in a car accident) getting ready and riding the joystick controlled board in Foster City Ca.  She had a blast and would love to have access to one.

We provide the world with our adaptive water sports technology.Our mission is to improve the quality of life for people facing physical and emotional challenges by developing innovative mobility solutions for flat water and ocean recreation.GLM's present focus is providing  individuals with limitations with electric powered Adaptive SUPs (Stand Up Paddle Boards) and electric powered Adaptive Wave Skis for surfing.Our Ambassadors In the flat water world of lakes, rivers, and estuaries, our ambassador is Veteran Sean Ryan.  In the video above you heard Sean talk about his experience with our innovative adaptive SUP in a San Francisco Bay Marina. In the surfing world our ambassador is Veteran Mark Thornton, a wave-skier with paraplegia (pictured below.)   Mark lives in the San Diego area and is excited about sharing the joy of the Adaptive Wave Ski with fellow veterans.With Sean leading the way, our goal is to build a robust and reliable adapted SUP, for use by Veteran's Program Outreach and various Challenged Athletes in the San Francisco Bay Area. We'll be working with the recreation therapists at the Palo Alto and Menlo Park Veterans Hospitals  and with established Veterans organizations such as Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA) and Disabled American Veterans (DAV). Also we'll be doing our own outreach to get veterans and athletes with challenges out on flat water of the bay for fun, mobility and independence.  We will also do the same with ambassador Mark Thornton and the wave ski board in the San Diego area.Where will your contribution go?We are a lean organization fueled by volunteer labor and a minimum of cash.  In our  project to build an electric assist surfboard for an injured competitive surfer (see story below) we had 6 volunteers donating over 1700 hours, and 5 business sponsors who donated materials and labor. We plan to run the Water Mobility outreach program in  a similar fashion and will continue to use volunteers to cover outreach for the SF bay area and San Diego.The following chart shows how your contributions will be spent  for the adaptive SUP and the adaptive Wave Ski campaign. Raising $30,000.00 Our StoryHow did GoodLife Mobility's mission evolve?  Our roots are in surfing, and in 2003, I built my first prototype.  As an aging surfer, I was running out of paddle power and was tired of missing literally hundreds of waves.A pivotal moment for my work came in 2004 when I met a courageous young surfer who became a quadriplegic after being injured by a fluke wave.  With no feeling from the chest down and very limited use of his arms, he did not let his condition stop him. I watched in awe as his surfing friends pushed him into scary waves in Ventura, California.I immediately knew that others needed electric assist technology more than I did. That realization, plus years of engineering innovations, resulted in  the world’s first joystick-controlled, steerable electric surfboard. Using this board  at a Malibu beach test session in June 2012, the  young surfer was able to surf independently again. He caught a lot of waves, hung out in the surf for over an hour, and even used the electric assist board to tow his buddies!Below are pictures of Julia Olson (who sustained a spinal cord injury in a car accident) getting ready and riding the joystick controlled board in Foster City Ca.  She had a blast and would love to have access to one. (Please note we are not building a Joy Stick controlled board as part of this campaign.)             Most of the effort put into the electric surfboard was self-funded and assisted by small donations. In 2010, we got a big boost from a quality of life grant from the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation; most of the engineering effort is from volunteers, individuals, and companies who have generously donated their time and resources.To view a listing of some of the contributors and see the board in action, please click the link below:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bbq1Uz5nR3wWhere we are nowOver the years, I’ve encountered a lot of other people who, like the courageous young surfer, could benefit from this adaptive technology.   This is especially true of our warriors who were wounded in service to our country.I believe in the healing power or fun, recreation, and just being out on the water.  My sense is that experience helps heal all of us, especially if we're dealing with gnarly conditions like PTSD.I am especially eager to give back the joy of being on the water to our returning vets.  I'd like to see every VA Hospital and recreation center have adaptive water sports and this Indiegogo campaign is an important beginning toward that goal.Our ongoing supportersWe have been overwhelmed by the support provided by so many folks along the way. Here's a picture of me with Jerry Lopez, my long time surfing and SUP hero, about to sign a SUP poster, one of the Perks available for your contribution to the campaign. Jerry has supported us along with two more of my heroes, Maverick's big wave surfers Jeff Clark and Frosty Hesson.   (Jeff donated his shaping expertise and Frosty has contributed signed copies of his memoir, another Perk you can receive.)       What you can do to contributeSure, we'd love for you to find a great perk or simply make a donation to our campaign.

dependent on other people’s help. Without the possibility to use their hands
they need help from their family members and other caregivers with all tasks of
everyday life. Also, they are typically forced to pay for additional help of
personal assistants. </p>
<p>The life quality of a disabled person is severely
affected, as well as of the whole family of a disabled person. A disabled
person feels constant frustration not being able to do anything on her own, and
at the same time their loved ones are under constant pressure, needing to be
around all the time. Additionally, a disabled person is completely deprived
from privacy, cannot even have a private telephone conversation since there
should be a person nearby to facilitate a phone call for her. As a consequence,
everyone is unhappy, both a disabled person and the family, which is completely
exhausted both emotionally and financially.</p>

With Serwantess, a
person with disability regains the independence. The simple tasks of everyday
life become feasible and can be done without the need to ask others for help.
It is also a big help for the whole family since they don’t have to be at
constant service day and night. Furthermore, Serwantess reduces the need for
paid personal assistants.<p><br/></p><p></p><h3>Kristijan and Milana Need Our Help</h3>Milana is 34 years old and she lives in Rijeka.

Kako bi pomogli osobama s invaliditetom razvili smo Servus.</p><p>Servus je elektronički sustav koji osobama s invaliditetom omogućava da pomoću glasovnih naredbi upravljaju svojim domom. Sa Servusom doslovno možete razgovarati i na taj način kontrolirati svjetlo, TV, telefon, radio, klima uređaj, otvoriti vrata, pa čak i surfati internetom.</p><p>Prvi Servus sustav napravili smo prije pet godina. Od tada je Servus postao pouzdani proizvod koji služi osobama s teškim invaliditetima kako bi imali bolji i vodili samostalniji život. U Hrvatskoj smo do sada instalirali preko trideset Servusa u domovima osoba s različitim vrstama invaliditeta.</p><h3>Donacije koje mijenjaju život</h3><p></p><p>Asistivna tehnologija kao što je Servus u Hrvatskoj nije sufinancirana od države. Budući da se osobe s invaliditetom često često nalaze u vrlo teškoj financijskoj situaciji, trebamo Vašu pomoć kako bismo omogućili da osobe s invaliditetom dobiju Servus sustav potpuno besplatno.</p><p>Za svakih 3,000 dolara koje prikupimo, jedna osoba s teškim invaliditetom će dobiti donaciju koja sadrži kompletni Servus sustav sa sljedećim funkcijama:</p><p></p><ul>

To će biti osobna poruka zahvale našeg tima i osobe s invaliditetom koja je dobila Servus sustav.</p><p>Cijela naša misija svodi se na pomaganje ljudima. Stoga Vam puno hvala što ste naš partner u poboljšavanju života osobama s invaliditetom.</p><p></p><h3>Servus vraća samostalnost</h3><p></p><p>Osobe koje
nemaju kontrolu nad svojim tijelom u potpunosti su ovisne o pomoći drugih. Bez
mogućnosti da koriste svoje ruke, trebaju pomoć članova obitelji i drugih
njegovatelja za najobičnije svakodnevne radnje. Također su često prisiljeni
plaćati dodatnu pomoć.</p>
<p>Kako i
osobama s invaliditetom, tako i obiteljima tih osoba, kvaliteta života im je često
loša. Osoba s invaliditetom neprestano je frustrirana što ne može ništa
samostalno raditi te su i njihovi bližnji pod stalnim pritiskom time što moraju
biti uvijek u mogućnosti priskočiti u pomoć. Nadalje, osoba s invaliditetom
nema privatnosti i ne može obaviti ni telefonski razgovor a da nije pokraj nje
ili njega osoba koja pomaže oko samog telefonsa. Zbog toga su svi nesretni i to
je vrlo iscrpljujuće – emotivno i financijski.</p>
<p>Sa Servusom
osoba s invaliditetom ponovo zadobiva svoju neovisnost. Jednostavni zadatci
svakodnevnice postaju lako ostvarivi i mogu biti obavljeni bez pomoći drugih
osoba. Kako uz pomoć Servusa obitelj ne mora biti cijelo vrijeme uz osobu s
invaliditetom, time je i Servus od velike pomoći cijeloj obitelji. Ne moramo ni
spominjati kako Servus umanjuje potrebu za plaćanjem dodatnih pomoćnika.</p><p></p><h3>Kristijan i Milana trebaju našu pomoć</h3><p>Milana ima 34 godine i živi u Rijeci. Ima multiplu sklerozu koja ju je prisilila na korištenje invalidskih kolica i onemogućila da normalno koristi ruke. Milana je diplomirala sociologiju na Sveučilištu u Zagrebu, ali zbog progresivne bolesti ne može raditi niti samostalno živjeti. Zahvaljujući prvim donatorima, Milana je već u polovici ove kampanje dobila svoj Servus sustav kako bi mogla samostalnije živjeti.</p><p>Kristijan ima 19 godina i živi u Zagrebu. Do nedavno je bio potpuno zdrav dok mu nije za 18. rođendan dijagnosticirana amiotrofična lateralna skleroza (ALS). ALS je progresivna neurološka bolest koja mu je pored ostaloga onemogućila da normalno koristi ruke. Naš sljedeći cilj je pomoći Kristijanu kako bi postao neovisniji uz pomoć Servus sustava.</p><p></p><h3>Naš tim</h3><p></p>Naš tim sastoji se od visokoobrazovanih stručnjaka
u području informatičke i komunikacijske tehnologije, digitalne obrade signala,
raspoznavanja govora i sinteze, akustike, elektronike i automatike. Svojom
sposobnosću i znanjem želimo pomoći svim osobama koje žive u teškim okolnostima
zbog njihovog tjelesnog invaliditeta, bolesti i dr.<br/><p></p><p><br/></p><h3>Priče korisnika</h3><p><b>Mario Kutle (38) iz Zagreba</b></p><p>Prije nekoliko godina sam obolio od multiple skleroze. Do tada sam normalno funkcionirao, volio kretati se i uživati u životu kao i ostali zdravi ljudi. Bolest je došla naglo, prvo mi je udarila na oči zbog čega sam privremeno izgubio vid, a onda prešla na ruke, kojima se nisam neko vrijeme mogao služiti, a sada i na noge. Sve je puno teže od tada, pa se mogu kretati jedino uz pomoć invalidskih kolica. Bolest mi je onemogućila da živim slobodno i neovisno kao što svaka zdrava osoba. No zahvaljujući Servusu moj svakodnevni život je puno lakši. Servus mi je od velike pomoći. </p><p>Ne moram stalno ležati u krevetu u mraku, jer na moju naredbu upali svjetlo. Zatim, kada mi netko pozvoni na ulazu u stan, tu osobu vidim na kameri i kažem Servusu da mi otvori vrata. Sa Servusom mogu upravljati televizorom i nazvati nekoga na telefon. Telefon koristim tako da Servusu kažem ime osobe koju želim nazvati.</p><p>Sve u svemu, živim puno bolje, jer sam neovisan unatoč tomu što živim s roditeljima. Da nema Servusa, uvijek bi mi netko trebao pomagati, nekoga bih morao gnjaviti, a ovako sam mogu obavljati neke radnje.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>

Milana's Serwantess is currently being prepared and she will get it very soon.Kristijan is 19 years old and he lives in Zagreb. He was a healthy young person until his 18th birthday when he was diagnosed with Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). ALS is a progressive neurological disease which made him severely disabled, making it impossible for him to use his hands. Kristijan lives with his mother which takes care of him. Our next milestone is to help Kristijan become more independent with the help of Serwantess voice control.The TeamWe formed a highly educated team of experts in the fields of information and communication technologies, digital signal processing, speech recognition and synthesis, acoustics, electronics and automation. Our wish is to use our expertise and knowledge to help all people living in difficult circumstances due to physical disability, old age, illness or disability in general.We CareWhen starting the campaign, Miroslav, the founder of E-Glas, decided to personally promote the campaign by riding in the wheelchair on the streets of Croatia. To someone it might look as a joke but for us it is a very serious task of raising the awareness of the Serwantess project and to make people more ready to help persons with severe disabilities and with no income to become more independent.User StoriesMarko ArambašićMarko Arambašić is a doctoral student at the University of Zagreb. Marko suffers from muscular distrophy which tied him to the electric wheelchair. Serwantess helps him to live more independently.Antonio CvetojevićAntonio is 19 years old. He lives in Zagreb and suffers from cerebral palsy. Several months ago, Antonio got his Serwantess system which made him more independent in performing everyday tasks.Mario KutleSeveral years ago I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Until then, I lived normally and enjoyed life like every other person. The disease affected my hands which I could not use because they went paralyzed. It spread to my legs too. Since then, everything is much more difficult because I can only move in wheelchair. Disease made impossible for me to go out and live independently like every other healthy person. However, thanks to Serwantess, everyday life has become much easier. Serwantess is a great help for me. Thanks to Serwantess, I don't lie in dark all the time because on my command System turns the light on. Furthermore, when someone is at the front door I can see that person on my television and I can tell Serwantess to unlock the door. With Serwantess, I can control my television and make a phone call. All I need to do is say the name of the person I want to call.Altogether, my life is much better since I have Serwantess. Although I live with my parents, I am independent. If there wasn't for Serwantess, I would need help 24/7, I would always have to bother someone for simple everyday activities. This way I can do it myself.Other Ways You Can HelpThe financial contribution is not the only way you can help. If you would like to support us you can also:

 Hrvatska verzija. Croatian version.Servus pomaže osobama s invaliditetomE-Glas je visokotehnološka tvrtka sa Sveučilišta u Rijeci koja je nastala kroz volonterski rad s osobama s invaliditetom. Kako bi pomogli osobama s invaliditetom razvili smo Servus.Servus je elektronički sustav koji osobama s invaliditetom omogućava da pomoću glasovnih naredbi upravljaju svojim domom. Sa Servusom doslovno možete razgovarati i na taj način kontrolirati svjetlo, TV, telefon, radio, klima uređaj, otvoriti vrata, pa čak i surfati internetom.Prvi Servus sustav napravili smo prije pet godina. Od tada je Servus postao pouzdani proizvod koji služi osobama s teškim invaliditetima kako bi imali bolji i vodili samostalniji život. U Hrvatskoj smo do sada instalirali preko trideset Servusa u domovima osoba s različitim vrstama invaliditeta.Donacije koje mijenjaju životAsistivna tehnologija kao što je Servus u Hrvatskoj nije sufinancirana od države. Budući da se osobe s invaliditetom često često nalaze u vrlo teškoj financijskoj situaciji, trebamo Vašu pomoć kako bismo omogućili da osobe s invaliditetom dobiju Servus sustav potpuno besplatno.Za svakih 3,000 dolara koje prikupimo, jedna osoba s teškim invaliditetom će dobiti donaciju koja sadrži kompletni Servus sustav sa sljedećim funkcijama:

glasovno upravljanje TV-om


glasovno upravljanje svjetlom


mogućnost otvaranja vrata glasom te video nadzor ulaznih vrata


kontrola web preglednika glasovnim naredbama 


samostalno telefoniranje i primanje poziva glasovnim naredbama

Korisnici se biraju prema stupnju invaliditeta i financijskih (ne)mogućnosti. Možete biti sigurni kako će Vaše donacije uvelike utjecati na njihov život.Po uspješnom završetku kampanje snimit ćemo i video o svakoj pojedinoj osobi koja je dobile Servus zahvaljujući Vašim donacijama. To će biti osobna poruka zahvale našeg tima i osobe s invaliditetom koja je dobila Servus sustav.Cijela naša misija svodi se na pomaganje ljudima. Stoga Vam puno hvala što ste naš partner u poboljšavanju života osobama s invaliditetom.Servus vraća samostalnostOsobe koje
nemaju kontrolu nad svojim tijelom u potpunosti su ovisne o pomoći drugih. Bez
mogućnosti da koriste svoje ruke, trebaju pomoć članova obitelji i drugih
njegovatelja za najobičnije svakodnevne radnje. Također su često prisiljeni
plaćati dodatnu pomoć.
Kako i
osobama s invaliditetom, tako i obiteljima tih osoba, kvaliteta života im je često
loša. Osoba s invaliditetom neprestano je frustrirana što ne može ništa
samostalno raditi te su i njihovi bližnji pod stalnim pritiskom time što moraju
biti uvijek u mogućnosti priskočiti u pomoć. Nadalje, osoba s invaliditetom
nema privatnosti i ne može obaviti ni telefonski razgovor a da nije pokraj nje
ili njega osoba koja pomaže oko samog telefonsa. Zbog toga su svi nesretni i to
je vrlo iscrpljujuće – emotivno i financijski.
Sa Servusom
osoba s invaliditetom ponovo zadobiva svoju neovisnost. Jednostavni zadatci
svakodnevnice postaju lako ostvarivi i mogu biti obavljeni bez pomoći drugih
osoba. Kako uz pomoć Servusa obitelj ne mora biti cijelo vrijeme uz osobu s
invaliditetom, time je i Servus od velike pomoći cijeloj obitelji. Ne moramo ni
spominjati kako Servus umanjuje potrebu za plaćanjem dodatnih pomoćnika.Kristijan i Milana trebaju našu pomoćMilana ima 34 godine i živi u Rijeci. Ima multiplu sklerozu koja ju je prisilila na korištenje invalidskih kolica i onemogućila da normalno koristi ruke. Milana je diplomirala sociologiju na Sveučilištu u Zagrebu, ali zbog progresivne bolesti ne može raditi niti samostalno živjeti. Zahvaljujući prvim donatorima, Milana je već u polovici ove kampanje dobila svoj Servus sustav kako bi mogla samostalnije živjeti.Kristijan ima 19 godina i živi u Zagrebu. Do nedavno je bio potpuno zdrav dok mu nije za 18. rođendan dijagnosticirana amiotrofična lateralna skleroza (ALS). ALS je progresivna neurološka bolest koja mu je pored ostaloga onemogućila da normalno koristi ruke. Naš sljedeći cilj je pomoći Kristijanu kako bi postao neovisniji uz pomoć Servus sustava.Naš timNaš tim sastoji se od visokoobrazovanih stručnjaka
u području informatičke i komunikacijske tehnologije, digitalne obrade signala,
raspoznavanja govora i sinteze, akustike, elektronike i automatike. Svojom
sposobnosću i znanjem želimo pomoći svim osobama koje žive u teškim okolnostima
zbog njihovog tjelesnog invaliditeta, bolesti i dr.Priče korisnikaMario Kutle (38) iz ZagrebaPrije nekoliko godina sam obolio od multiple skleroze. Do tada sam normalno funkcionirao, volio kretati se i uživati u životu kao i ostali zdravi ljudi. Bolest je došla naglo, prvo mi je udarila na oči zbog čega sam privremeno izgubio vid, a onda prešla na ruke, kojima se nisam neko vrijeme mogao služiti, a sada i na noge. Sve je puno teže od tada, pa se mogu kretati jedino uz pomoć invalidskih kolica. Bolest mi je onemogućila da živim slobodno i neovisno kao što svaka zdrava osoba. No zahvaljujući Servusu moj svakodnevni život je puno lakši. Servus mi je od velike pomoći. Ne moram stalno ležati u krevetu u mraku, jer na moju naredbu upali svjetlo. Zatim, kada mi netko pozvoni na ulazu u stan, tu osobu vidim na kameri i kažem Servusu da mi otvori vrata. Sa Servusom mogu upravljati televizorom i nazvati nekoga na telefon. Telefon koristim tako da Servusu kažem ime osobe koju želim nazvati.Sve u svemu, živim puno bolje, jer sam neovisan unatoč tomu što živim s roditeljima. Da nema Servusa, uvijek bi mi netko trebao pomagati, nekoga bih morao gnjaviti, a ovako sam mogu obavljati neke radnje.",11.0,2,"2 Campaigns

<p>All living cells have DNA in them that tell the cells what to create, how to grow, and how to interact with their environment. DNA is kind of like a software program for living cells, and the cells are like the mini factories that run the DNA programs. At Amino, we think of DNA programs like an Android or iPhone ""Apps"" for living cells.<br/></p>
<p>But even more, keeping living cells alive outside of their normal environment requires other growth liquids, like food, and chemicals. Amino Apps are a combination of the DNA programs and the growth liquids.</p>
<p><b>Living Cells + DNA program + Growth Liquid = Amino App</b><br/></p>
<p>We are also developing a way for you to be able to add your own substances too (create your own growth liquid) — what happens if you give you living cells coffee, vinegar, apple juice?  You tell us! </p>
<p>With Amino, you can create endless applications and, as the system develops it will be easier to share, compare and create new Apps for yourself and the community.</p>

<p>Synthetic biology and wetware is poised to be the dominant technology of this century, the way electrical engineering was for this last century. It allows scientist to problem-solve food, energy, health and materials in sustainable new ways.

<p>For our first product, the <i>Amino One</i>, you get to choose between Amino Glow which glows like a night light and Amino Explorer which allows you to explore a variety of DNA programs, like optimizing the pathway for violacein production, an expensive anti-cancer, anti-parasitic research compound. </p>
<p>Amino is a general platform that allows you to buy different Amino Apps to grow and take care of different living systems in your Amino! This means that whatever Amino One unit you end up buying, you will be able to run different Amino Apps as we develop them. Apps will be priced between $150 and $400, depending on the DNA program and number of components. Amino also comes with an automated cleaning system to allow you to run a new app, and you will also be able to buy food refills to keep your apps growing longer and brighter!<br/></p>

<p>Amino was started at the MIT Media Lab by founder Julie Legault. After experiencing the difficulties of learning synthetic biology from textbooks and online material, Julie decided to create a mini-lab that could help other people learn science by doing it. Having the opportunity to learn and explore an impactful science like bioengineering should be given to everyone -- just think of what we can achieve when a 1000x + minds are working on problem-solving and creating for the next century!</p>
<p>If you want to know more about the story behind Amino coming out of MIT's Media Lab, <a href=""https://medium.com/@medialab/synbio-for-the-masses-a-media-lab-grad-s-deploy-or-die-story-dc712311079a"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">read our blog post here</a> </p>

<p>Following graduation, Julie teamed up with her old Concordia University and Montreal maker friends at Robocut Studio in Montreal to develop a reliable, multi-use system. And now, Amino Labs is made up of a talented anti-discplinary team of people with expertise transcending design, manufacturing, electrical / mechanical engineering, product development and synthetic biology.  We are now a multi-location team as well, developing the hardware in Montreal, the science in Toronto, the business in San Francisco, the software in Boston, and the design wherever Julie happens to be. We are also fortunate to have the support of amazing mentors and partnerships without who developing Amino would not be possible .</p>

<p>There are always challenges around the subject of biosafety and biosecurity. Amino Labs has aligned itself with President Obama, the National Security Counsil, and The National Strategy for Countering Biological Threats, who have asserted that ""The beneficial nature of life science research is reflected in the widespread manner in which it occurs. From cutting-edge academic institutes, to industrial research centers, to private laboratories in basements and garages, progress is increasingly driven by innovation and open access to the insights and materials needed to advance individual initiatives."" Moreover their strategy is targeted to reduce biology threads by ""improving global access to the life science to combat infectious disease regardless of its cause"". </p>
<p>Check with your local laws and regulations to see if you can use an Amino. In certain jurisdictions, such as in Europe,  extra certification is required to learn genetic engineering.<br/></p>
<p>We believe that increasing meaningful engagement with and understanding of biology can only be done in a learn-by-doing manner, but this means making synthetic biology technology available. This will naturally create concern.</p>

At Amino Labs, our goal is to make genetic engineering accessible to everyone and enable the next wave of personalized manufacturing using  biology. 
Amino is our first product, a counter-top sized biolab that enables anyone to grow living cells to create new and interesting things - like fragrances, flavours, materials, medicine, and more.

To get you started, Amino ships with Amino Glow App - your own ready-to-engineer living nightlight. 










Everything in Amino is easy to follow and to understand —we try to explain it all in a very friendly way, but it is also a very sophisticated system that can be used in pro labs too— Amino enables you to to continuously grow living cells and collect multiple sources of data in real time. When you get your Amino, we will cover all the basic terms, concept and science but if you want to go much deeper in the science and creation, we will help you do that too! 
Amino is a small and simple-to-use hardware system that enables anyone to grow and take care of living cells. We are the world’s first publicly available bioengineering platform that can be used at home, in labs or in schools.

Here is a timelapse of bacteria we engineered to be red! 




All living cells have DNA in them that tell the cells what to create, how to grow, and how to interact with their environment. DNA is kind of like a software program for living cells, and the cells are like the mini factories that run the DNA programs. At Amino, we think of DNA programs like an Android or iPhone ""Apps"" for living cells.
But even more, keeping living cells alive outside of their normal environment requires other growth liquids, like food, and chemicals. Amino Apps are a combination of the DNA programs and the growth liquids.
Living Cells + DNA program + Growth Liquid = Amino App
We are also developing a way for you to be able to add your own substances too (create your own growth liquid) — what happens if you give you living cells coffee, vinegar, apple juice?  You tell us! 
With Amino, you can create endless applications and, as the system develops it will be easier to share, compare and create new Apps for yourself and the community.


Amino replaces traditional bulky lab equipment with a self-contained desktop system -- what is special about the technology behind Amino is that it reduces what usually costs thousands of dollars to just a few hundred. And with the automated data capture, you'll learn more about how your cells are growing than it is possible with present day lab equipment.

One year in the making with an amazing team from MIT Media Lab and Montreal Makers, the Amino is to biotechnology what 3D printing did to manufacturing. With Amino, we hope to help make genetic engineering and synthetic biology accessible to everyone and enable the next wave of innovation in science, like 3D printing has done for physical products. 
Synthetic biology and wetware is poised to be the dominant technology of this century, the way electrical engineering was for this last century. It allows scientist to problem-solve food, energy, health and materials in sustainable new ways. By bringing the science out of the labs with the Amino, we are enabling everyone to take part in their own future by creating and problem-solving at home and in the DIY labs.  Amino gives you a chance to experience this impactful technology, hands on.
What if many millions of people from around the world could help solve cancer, instead of a small number of scientists?





For our first product, the Amino One, you get to choose between Amino Glow which glows like a night light and Amino Explorer which allows you to explore a variety of DNA programs, like optimizing the pathway for violacein production, an expensive anti-cancer, anti-parasitic research compound. 
Amino is a general platform that allows you to buy different Amino Apps to grow and take care of different living systems in your Amino! This means that whatever Amino One unit you end up buying, you will be able to run different Amino Apps as we develop them. Apps will be priced between $150 and $400, depending on the DNA program and number of components. Amino also comes with an automated cleaning system to allow you to run a new app, and you will also be able to buy food refills to keep your apps growing longer and brighter!





Amino Glow - Early Adopters - $499

Want to learn more? Pick a workshop!
Amino Labs and Synbiota offer you the chance to have an exclusive 3 day workshop where you will design and create a DNA program, and use your Amino One to the program in your living cells, grow them and keep them alive.  Not only will this be a great chance for you, your friends and kids to learn more about synthetic biology from an expert Dr. Justin Pahara and explore the creative side of making with designer Julie Legault, but you will also get to keep an engraved Amino to continue exploring and making in the future!



(Left: Founder Julie attends her first synbio Synbiota Workshop!  Right: Julie leads her first workshop in the first synbio track of Media Lab Design Innovation Workshop  2015)

You can also support accessible science and look cool doing it! 
Cory Schmitz is an amazing designer. AND an amazing friend who agreed to make our logo, stickers and all the swag we can think of (...we're still thinking of more!) 




As a kit-based system, Amino is for everyone -- want to create something we haven't mentioned yet ? See below for future things you can build, and let us know your ideas!

The array of possible Amino Apps is endless. We are already thinking about what is next. What about Amino Apps that could enable you to practice engineering bread, beer, cider or wine yeast? Or yogurt bacteria? What about smells or colours? You could even practice making medicine. And, if you’re up for the challenge, you can develop your own DNA program, and grow and culture it using your Amino. And, by partnering up with Synbiota, a DNA programming company, we are opening DNA creation to everyone - by using their technology, you can create your own genetic programs and insert them into cells with Amino. The possibilities are endless!  Let us know what you'd want to use amino for! 





Amino takes you on a journey.1. Make it: you get to put a DNA program into living cells using Amino2. Grow it: with Amino you keep tabs on how your living cells are growing3. Keep it: by choosing when and how much food, chemicals, and what temperature to grow the cells at, you really do get to take care of your living cells. To keep it alive for long periods of time, you will need to 
refill its food supplies. Each 
refill kit will be available from our shop and distributors. 
Here is an overview of the Amino App components you will encounter. Don't worry, everything you need - DNA, microorganisms, liquids - is included in your Amino kit, and all the instructions will be easy to follow. 



Amino can be used by makers, students, bakers, brewers, explorers alike.  Amino is a general platform for growing living cells like friendly bacteria or yeast. Bacteria are used in products like yogurt, cheese, soy sauce, medicine and cosmetics.  Yeast are used to brew beer, bake cakes, breads and other yummy things. Both can also be used to create flavours, scents, materials. 

  
Our simple 1-2-3 step process makes it easy to program DNA into living cells and then grow, and take care of those cells to learn about biology and to create awesome things. These easy-to-use Amino Apps make learning about biology, genetic engineering, bioengineering, biotechnology, and synthetic biology suitable and safe for home, DIY, Labs and School use. 

Amino One is optimized for use with a friendly type of bacteria used by scientists for research in labs. This bacterial strain can safely be used by anyone, anywhere in North America. Please check your local regulations if you are outside of North America as these might be different. Contact us at info@amino.bio for any questions. Amino has a set of on-screen, real-time instructions and status indicator lights, as well as online videos and walk-throughs to guide you. 



Amino is a sophisticated piece of hardware with circulation and temperature controls for the user, as well as sensors that help you keep tabs on how fast your microbes are growing and how much food they’re eating. It has modular chambers, that allows you to swap in new microbe food and nutrients, pH balancing solutions, and even other chemicals that help control your DNA program in your microbe.  
Amino has a screen for real-time instructions and indicator lights to guide you through the creation process. Amino reduces the size and complex nature of large laboratory equipment into a counter-top sized system
Sensors


 pH (1-14)


 Optical Density (calibrated for OD600)


 Temperature (two sensors: T1: +/- 2 C; T2 +/- 0.1 C)


Functionalities compared to traditional lab technoloogy


 Water baths, heading blocks become Incubation stations ( plate ) with temperature controls (30 C - 42 C)


 Shaker incubation becomes continuous liquid growth with temperature & flow controls (flow & dimensions optimized)


Instead of having to collect samples and use equipment like a spectrophotometer, you get real time data analysis in a browser


Autoclave is replaced by Amino's contained inactivation protocol (uses contained chemical inactivation)





A real example of data comparing one of Amino's sensors  to a large and expensive Absorbance spectrophotometer.
                 





Amino was started at the MIT Media Lab by founder Julie Legault. After experiencing the difficulties of learning synthetic biology from textbooks and online material, Julie decided to create a mini-lab that could help other people learn science by doing it. Having the opportunity to learn and explore an impactful science like bioengineering should be given to everyone -- just think of what we can achieve when a 1000x + minds are working on problem-solving and creating for the next century!
If you want to know more about the story behind Amino coming out of MIT's Media Lab, read our blog post here 


Following graduation, Julie teamed up with her old Concordia University and Montreal maker friends at Robocut Studio in Montreal to develop a reliable, multi-use system. And now, Amino Labs is made up of a talented anti-discplinary team of people with expertise transcending design, manufacturing, electrical / mechanical engineering, product development and synthetic biology.  We are now a multi-location team as well, developing the hardware in Montreal, the science in Toronto, the business in San Francisco, the software in Boston, and the design wherever Julie happens to be. We are also fortunate to have the support of amazing mentors and partnerships without who developing Amino would not be possible .




 


Amino is for everyone -- that means that the user interaction and the reliability of the platform is crucial. We've made sure to keep our Aminos friendly, playful and powerful, focussing on user feedback to lead the design development.  
Here are a few picture of some of the early prototypes, and design research that got us this far!
""I think of Amino like Tamagotchi pets, except rather than taking care of a digital dog or cat, here you’re taking care of bacteria or yeast. In that process you, your family, and your friends will learn about how your microbes work - you might even love them""  - Julie, CEO, on the inspiration for the user experience of Amino




  




Fall 2015 - Beta Test with Schools and Museums
Winter 2015-16 - In house production (First 25 units)
Spring - Summer 2016 - Small batch production (Next 50-100 units) & New DNA kit Development
Fall 2016 - Launch of new DNA kits & Amino Companion Units Development
Winter 2016- 17 - Large scale production / Manufacturing

 


To get to our first batch of 25 hardened, hand crafted Amino One's, we need to raise $12,500. Further Amino One production is a matter of materials and time for assembly, which are covered by the rewards. 
After Amino One’s are delivered and deployed, we'll ask you for feedback and make future Aminos even better before we move into full-scale manufacturing.  

 

Amino Labs has tested the working prototype. Micro-organisms have been successfully grown, and the sensors have been validated to be functional. The primary challenge that the Amino team is currently facing is a slight re-designs of a couple components to improve functionality (but don't worry, it will still be beautiful!). The team has a lot of experience in iterative product development and this is a natural part of the process. We are confident that our timelines are reasonable and we will strive to deliver the Amino Ones as estimated or earlier.
There are always challenges around the subject of biosafety and biosecurity. Amino Labs has aligned itself with President Obama, the National Security Counsil, and The National Strategy for Countering Biological Threats, who have asserted that ""The beneficial nature of life science research is reflected in the widespread manner in which it occurs. From cutting-edge academic institutes, to industrial research centers, to private laboratories in basements and garages, progress is increasingly driven by innovation and open access to the insights and materials needed to advance individual initiatives."" Moreover their strategy is targeted to reduce biology threads by ""improving global access to the life science to combat infectious disease regardless of its cause"". 
Check with your local laws and regulations to see if you can use an Amino. In certain jurisdictions, such as in Europe,  extra certification is required to learn genetic engineering.
We believe that increasing meaningful engagement with and understanding of biology can only be done in a learn-by-doing manner, but this means making synthetic biology technology available. This will naturally create concern.",41.0,2,"1 Campaign

Exactly one week later I was in a major debulking surgery where they removed 3 large tumors (there was a 3rd they didn't see on the scan), my omentum, my left ovary and half of my right ovary. I was in the hospital for 9 days before I was finally well enough to return home. A month after surgery I started chemotherapy. I will have 6-8 months of chemotherapy. Mid-September they will do another PET scan to determine when they would like to do my second surgery. Because they weren't sure exactly what variety of ovarian cancer I had when they did the 1st surgery they did not remove all my reproductive organs.

<h3>About Lexi and her family<br/>
</h3>Lexi's mother, Lisa, is a long time friend of my husband.  This is Lisa's daughter, Lexi. Lexi is 12 years old. Both pictures (seen above) are 
actually her and were taken only about 7 mos apart from each other. <p></p>Lexi
 has juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, as well as ulcerative colitis, an 
inflammatory bowel disease where her own body attacks her digestive 
system causing it to ulcerate and bleed. Lexi has been hospitalized 11 
times since last November, each time with unbearable joint pain, stomach
 pain, and profuse bleeding. She required 3 blood transfusions within 
just a 2 week time span, and to try to give her at least SOME measure of
 relief, the doctors treated her with massive doses of steroids and 
immunosuppressor medications. Now, not only does she have this painful 
autoimmune disease, she also now has three additional debilitating 
diseases from the medications. She developed Cushings syndrome, a 
steroid caused disease where you get ""moon face"", gain a ""fat pad"" 
(often called a buffalo hump) on the back of your neck, and at 12 yrs 
old she now has purple stretch marks all over her body. She also 
developed adrenal insufficiency, which means if her body is under any 
kind of trauma or stress, her adrenal glands will not work and she will 
have organ failure unless an emergency dose of steroid is given quickly.
 Lastly, she was diagnosed 3 weeks ago with avascular necrosis, a loss 
of blood flow to the bones of her knees, shoulders, and ankles. This 
means that her bones are degenerating and as her physical therapist 
terms it, the bones look like ""swiss cheese."" She already uses a 
wheelchair about 50% of the time, now it looks as though her future is a
 permanent wheelchair. All of these ""additional"" life altering diseases 
because there is no cure to colitis.<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Lexi was recently approved to go to the Cleveland Clinic by Medicaid.  
She will see a pediatric orthopedic specialist, Dr. Gurd, to help with 
her juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and some of the other diseases she 
contracted as a result of being on medications to fix the original 
diseases!  Lexi and her family were going to drive to Cleveland, but their van just won't make it.  Plane tickets are roughly $320 each (not counting taxes and service charges) and they need a hotel for Lisa to stay while Lexi is treated. This whole trip is just going to be too expensive for 
them. Lisa is an out of work Special Education Teacher and her husband works construction, when he can get work at all.  That's why this family needs help.</p>
<ul>
<li>We would like to raise at least $2,000 to cover the cost of the plane tickets, taxes, hotels and food for the 7 day treatment time and then some.<br/>
</li>
<li>Even if we don't reach the entire $2,000 goal, the funds that are raised will be sent directly to the family.  Indiegogo takes a percentage of the funds that are raised.If we reach the goal they take 4% of the total and if we don't reach the goal, they take 9% of the total.  I plan to personally cover the cost of either fee out of my own pocket so what you see as the total money raised will be exactly what the family gets.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This money will make a huge difference to this family. They are already low on funds because they have been unemployed and their healthcare bills are so high.  This small amount will be a ray of sunshine in this little girl's life.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I understand that some of you may not feel comfortable giving money directly through indiegogo or to the family.  If you still wish to help out financially, the family would appreciate a donation to the Crohns and Colitis foundation (CCFA) because we HAVE to find a cure. 1.4 million other Americans deal with Crohn's disease or colitis every day, but it is all of these side effects that we are working to eliminate!

Lexi's mother, Lisa, is a long time friend of my husband.  This is Lisa's daughter, Lexi. Lexi is 12 years old. Both pictures (seen above) are 
actually her and were taken only about 7 mos apart from each other. Lexi
 has juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, as well as ulcerative colitis, an 
inflammatory bowel disease where her own body attacks her digestive 
system causing it to ulcerate and bleed. Lexi has been hospitalized 11 
times since last November, each time with unbearable joint pain, stomach
 pain, and profuse bleeding. She required 3 blood transfusions within 
just a 2 week time span, and to try to give her at least SOME measure of
 relief, the doctors treated her with massive doses of steroids and

less than a year ago to my beautiful bride Megan. Six months after
our wedding, Megan was diagnosed with SNUC (Sinonasal Undifferentiated
Carcinoma) cancer. Not only is it rare for a female, it is also extremely rare
for her someone her age. I was told by her doctors that she is the
youngest woman in California to ever be diagnosed with this specific cancer at
age 25. Although she is the strongest person I know, this
cancer is extremely aggressive which makes her treatment aggressive as
well. To this date, she has undergone three surgeries with no guarantee
that more surgeries might be necessary. Right now, Megan has begun simultaneous
chemotherapy and radiation. This whole ordeal started with Megan waking up at
night with heavy nose bleeds. Her first ENT doctor spotted a mass in
her right nasal passage which was eventually diagnosed as SNUC. He said the
tumor looked very unusually and because of her age, it was very unlikely to be
cancerous. Because of this, we assumed it was a benign mass. One
morning, about six weeks later, he called her into the doctor’s office for her
results. She went in thinking it was just a benign tumor. January
7<sup>th</sup> 2014 (A day that will live in infamy)
the doctor explained to her she had SNUC cancer. Needless to say,
Megan was completely caught off guard to the deafening news; she was
numb. From that day on, she knew our life would never be the
same. My mother-in-law picked her up from the doctors and brought
her to me and we all just sat in silence. We agreed to a couple days
of unleashing our emotions but then the fight was on. </p>
<p> The
first surgery Megan underwent was for the original tumor. This
surgery went pretty smoothly but was basically a biopsy. Due to the extremely
rare nature, accompanied by the lack of research and development of SNUC, a
tumor board consisting of fifty or sixty Doctors was convened on
her behalf to discuss her options. During her tumor board meeting, we found out
that with the type of chemo she would undergo meant having children in the
future would be off the table, due to destruction of her ovaries. This
was devastating for us since we were already on the path to start a
family. Luckily, the timing worked out perfectly and we were able to
harvest seven embryos. I say we were lucky because the timing fell exactly on
the week IVF was possible before her other surgery was to take place. The
third surgery was her facial sinus tumor surgery to remove the entire
mass. This surgery she was extremely scared going into because a
craniotomy was on the table. A Craniotomy is where they access the
tumor by taking out a piece of your skull. Thanks to the experience and expertise
of her surgeon Dr. Wynn, she was able to avoid this invasive procedure but
there is a catch. If the chemo and radiation does not kill this
aggressive cancer then the craniotomy is back on the table. </p>
<p> Financially
this has been a huge burden on my wife and I. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act
(ACA) , Megan was able to stay on her Dads insurance but this will
run out shortly due to her turning 26 May 1<sup>st </sup>which means we will have large co pays due to
the nature of her now preexisting condition. Two years before we got married
Megan and I opened up a local business where Megan was born and raised. Just
when we began to see the fruit of our labor, her diagnosis took a huge toll on
us. The IVF was unfortunately not covered through insurance as well
and cost us <b>$17,000.00</b>. Of which we had to borrow within a couple of days to
make sure the timing worked out. Each doctor has his/her own distinctive list
of all these products, nutrients, lotions, mouthwashes, and supplies to help
Megan through her recovery and deal with side effects of Chemo and radiation.
This has been financially bearing on us. I often have sleepless nights were I
wonder why this is all happening and what else I could be doing to ease some of
the stress she is under. Because we are business partners and life partners,
Megan still insist on working through her recovery. This is bearing on me
because I know the best thing for her right now is to be in a stress free
environment. I work at least 80 hours a week between our business
and a part time job I work at night. Luckily, we have family and
friends who help out tremendously by getting Megan to her treatments and
appointments on time since I am often away working. Unfortunately their time
and effort doesn’t out weight the huge financial burden placed upon us at a
critical time in your lives. It is very hard for me to wave a white
flag and ask for help. Especially from people I may not know. To be
completely honest, l would rather suffer in silence but this isn’t about me or

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""""><span style=""""></span></p><p></p></div>","Hi, my name is Jonathan Powell. I got married
less than a year ago to my beautiful bride Megan. Six months after
our wedding, Megan was diagnosed with SNUC (Sinonasal Undifferentiated
Carcinoma) cancer. Not only is it rare for a female, it is also extremely rare
for her someone her age. I was told by her doctors that she is the
youngest woman in California to ever be diagnosed with this specific cancer at
age 25. Although she is the strongest person I know, this
cancer is extremely aggressive which makes her treatment aggressive as
well. To this date, she has undergone three surgeries with no guarantee
that more surgeries might be necessary. Right now, Megan has begun simultaneous
chemotherapy and radiation. This whole ordeal started with Megan waking up at
night with heavy nose bleeds. Her first ENT doctor spotted a mass in
her right nasal passage which was eventually diagnosed as SNUC. He said the
tumor looked very unusually and because of her age, it was very unlikely to be
cancerous. Because of this, we assumed it was a benign mass. One
morning, about six weeks later, he called her into the doctor’s office for her
results. She went in thinking it was just a benign tumor. January
7th 2014 (A day that will live in infamy)
the doctor explained to her she had SNUC cancer. Needless to say,
Megan was completely caught off guard to the deafening news; she was
numb. From that day on, she knew our life would never be the
same. My mother-in-law picked her up from the doctors and brought
her to me and we all just sat in silence. We agreed to a couple days
of unleashing our emotions but then the fight was on. 
 The
first surgery Megan underwent was for the original tumor. This
surgery went pretty smoothly but was basically a biopsy. Due to the extremely
rare nature, accompanied by the lack of research and development of SNUC, a
tumor board consisting of fifty or sixty Doctors was convened on
her behalf to discuss her options. During her tumor board meeting, we found out
that with the type of chemo she would undergo meant having children in the
future would be off the table, due to destruction of her ovaries. This
was devastating for us since we were already on the path to start a
family. Luckily, the timing worked out perfectly and we were able to
harvest seven embryos. I say we were lucky because the timing fell exactly on
the week IVF was possible before her other surgery was to take place. The
third surgery was her facial sinus tumor surgery to remove the entire
mass. This surgery she was extremely scared going into because a
craniotomy was on the table. A Craniotomy is where they access the
tumor by taking out a piece of your skull. Thanks to the experience and expertise
of her surgeon Dr. Wynn, she was able to avoid this invasive procedure but
there is a catch. If the chemo and radiation does not kill this
aggressive cancer then the craniotomy is back on the table. 
 Financially
this has been a huge burden on my wife and I. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act
(ACA) , Megan was able to stay on her Dads insurance but this will
run out shortly due to her turning 26 May 1st which means we will have large co pays due to
the nature of her now preexisting condition. Two years before we got married
Megan and I opened up a local business where Megan was born and raised. Just
when we began to see the fruit of our labor, her diagnosis took a huge toll on
us. The IVF was unfortunately not covered through insurance as well
and cost us $17,000.00. Of which we had to borrow within a couple of days to
make sure the timing worked out. Each doctor has his/her own distinctive list
of all these products, nutrients, lotions, mouthwashes, and supplies to help
Megan through her recovery and deal with side effects of Chemo and radiation.
This has been financially bearing on us. I often have sleepless nights were I
wonder why this is all happening and what else I could be doing to ease some of
the stress she is under. Because we are business partners and life partners,
Megan still insist on working through her recovery. This is bearing on me
because I know the best thing for her right now is to be in a stress free
environment. I work at least 80 hours a week between our business
and a part time job I work at night. Luckily, we have family and
friends who help out tremendously by getting Megan to her treatments and
appointments on time since I am often away working. Unfortunately their time
and effort doesn’t out weight the huge financial burden placed upon us at a
critical time in your lives. It is very hard for me to wave a white
flag and ask for help. Especially from people I may not know. To be
completely honest, l would rather suffer in silence but this isn’t about me or
my pride. As her husband, I can’t say that I did everything in my power to get
her better if I do not allow people to help who are willing. My wife
and I do Relay for Life every year, I just never imagined I would be the one in
need. I guess life is funny that way. The money we raise would be put
towards all the supplies for her recovery such as: vitamins, shakes, burn
lotions (due to radiation), travel (every day to radiation), mouth washes and
special toothpastes for dry mouth caused by radiation and accumulating medical
bills and co-payments. 
 I
love my wife so much and it hurts me to see her go through this battle. I love
her, and I want her to feel comfortable and not have to constantly worry about
our finances. We are not the type of people who usually asks for
help, but in this case, I have no choice but to do everything in my power to
get her on the path of recovery. Please donate to our cause, with the one man’s promise that your good deeds will be

Read on to find out why.</div> <p>The roof membrane is still exposed on the majority of the roof deck (that's the silver part you see in the photos) and we can't let our clients walk on it. By covering the membrane with special rubber pavers designed to allow proper drainage, we will be able to allow our clients to explore the entire rooftop and really enjoy the garden.

<p>In addition to adding the rubber floor to the roof, there are some important upgrades we need to make to the space.

We will also install a security camera system. <br/></p>
<p>The lighting outdoors needs some serious upgrading as well, and our plan includes  bistro-style globe string lights, mason jar lanterns, and solar-powered fairy lights overhead and among the plants to help maintain the serene, retreat-like ambience that we have already created in our interior studio. The rooftop gets a LOT of sun during the day, so we will install canvas 
sun sails to shade areas of the space while still allowing the plants to
 get much-needed sun. And we will commission more custom-built planters to complete the garden, and purchase tables &amp; seating for use during events.  <br/></p>

<h4></h4>
</div><div>
<p>A native of Austin, TX, our founder Alia J. Khan is a recovering attorney-turned-entrepreneur. She began practicing yoga when she began practicing law, because she knew she needed a way to balance out the stress of her new career, and obtained her 200-hour teaching certification from Tranquil Space in 2012. After nearly 5 years of working as an associate at an AmLaw 500 firm here in DC, Alia knew that the legal world was not the place for her. She embarked on a long and winding journey to find her dream career, making stops in the worlds of food writing and real estate along the way. Through her professional adventures, teaching yoga has always been a passion that fulfilled a very important part of her. But she knew that teaching yoga full-time would never fully satisfy all of her professional ambitions, so her search continued.</p>
<p>Alia had always dreamed of owning her own business, though she used to think that she wanted to open a restaurant. Two years of writing about the restaurant industry rid her of that notion completely, but her entreprenuerial spirit still burned strong. Her undergraduate degree was in business, and she longed to return to her business roots after her foray into the law. While using her real estate knowledge to help her partner search for office space for his business, she stumbled across a listing for a former dance studio just five blocks away from her home.</p>
<p>The moment she set foot in the space, Alia knew that she had to open a yoga studio there. After years of living on the Hill and crossing town to get her yoga fix, she was convinced that her neighborhood had a real need for the type of studio that she could open and the community she would build around it. And so, East Side Yoga was born!</p>
<p>Alia designed the East Side Yoga space and worked with local contractor GL Barnhart Construction to make it a reality. Using locally-sourced, salvaged materials, the GLBC team custom-built furniture, fixtures, and finishes that have truly made our space unlike any other in DC. Alia calls it her Farmhouse-Spa-Chic style, and has invested a lot of energy into making our clients feel like they have truly escaped from their everyday lives. A visit to East Side Yoga is a mini-retreat that you can treat yourself to every day!<br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>No Money? No Problem.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Tamiah Bridgett and 16 years ago, I “went natural.”  For those who don’t understand the term, I stopped using sodium hydroxide chemicals to achieve straight hair.  It was the best decision of my life and it literally led me to my life’s purpose.</p>
<p>You see, shortly after going natural women began asking me for style advice as they too wanted to be free from chemical relaxing.  At that time, there was no YouTube and there were few blogs on the subject.  In my hometown, I became a go-to person on styling natural hair.  I’d been working as a manicurist through college and graduate school, so the beauty industry was familiar to me but I never thought I’d go into hairstyling.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480614420/dce9fn8kz8smiifrq5dl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Fast-Forward to 2010.  I was working as a therapist and still assisting women with transitioning to their natural hair in droves.  So, I decided to start having Meetup events in my neighborhood.  Each time we met, more people came.  An attendee suggested that I put together an online community during the winter months to keep contact and <i>It’s a Natural Thang</i> was born on Facebook.   We remain a closed group as emotional safety is still important to me, but gain about 1,000 members annually.  We are pressing our way to 6000 members internationally!</p>

<p>I returned to beauty school with the intention of doing state advocacy to get more education on styling natural hair in beauty schools, but instead, was presented with an opportunity to apply for a start-up accelerator program.  I’d had this idea to transform the blow dryer.  Large name beauty companies have tried to create hair tools for natural hair but they still miss the mark.  Little did I know it, but I’d been working on a conceptual prototype for some time from tweaking my own tools!  In the late summer of 2015, I was accepted into the <a href=""http://alphalabgear.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Alphalab Gear</a> accelerator and <a href=""http://diversame.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Diversamē Inc</a> was born. </p>
<p>I contracted with engineers to take the concept of a dryer for textured hair into a working prototype form and here we are!   Our tool has been tested in multiple salons in the Pittsburgh region including The Natural Choice, Diva Den and Philip Pelusi!  Mr. Pelusi endorsed the Diversamē Drying Tool for its innovation and function. We are also endorsed as Dermatology Approved from Dr. Melanye Maclin, Dermatologist who is known for her work in Chris Rock’s <i>Good Hair</i> documentary, <a href=""http://www.hypehair.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hype Hair </a><a href=""http://www.hypehair.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Magazine</a> and the Steve Harvey Show.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution matters so much to the success of Diversamē  as it loans market validity.  Contributing proves to the “big guys” that the textured hair market is underserved and that we will invest in a company that considers and is concerned about our hair care process. </p>
<p>The  Diversamē  Drying Tool will have worldwide marketplace impact.  The face of the average American is changing and much of the hair textures across the globe are on the Curly Continuum, a term I’ve coined to express the vast nature of curly hair types and textures.  In an age of customization, it’s time that hair tools address the needs of those previously forgotten!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p> As a tech start-up company.  We have encountered many obstacles.  In spite of them all, we were still able to go from concept to functional prototype in under a year. Most of all we have gained the support of the Curly Continuum!  </p>
<p>If we don't meet our goal of $15K we will use whatever funds we have to go towards production as we seek further investment.   </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If by chance you are cannot financially contribute to our goal you can still help us bring Diversamē to market.  Word of mouth is what grew <i>It’s a Natural Thang</i> and it can do the same for Diversamē.  Please spread the word about this campaign and why it’s important.  Share the links.  Collect email addresses to help us spread the word! </p>
<p>Share, share and share again!</p>
<p>Thank you all in advance for your contributions and support!</p>

The Impact
Your contribution matters so much to the success of Diversamē  as it loans market validity.  Contributing proves to the “big guys” that the textured hair market is underserved and that we will invest in a company that considers and is concerned about our hair care process. 
The  Diversamē  Drying Tool will have worldwide marketplace impact.  The face of the average American is changing and much of the hair textures across the globe are on the Curly Continuum, a term I’ve coined to express the vast nature of curly hair types and textures.  In an age of customization, it’s time that hair tools address the needs of those previously forgotten!

Risks & Challenges
 As a tech start-up company.  We have encountered many obstacles.  In spite of them all, we were still able to go from concept to functional prototype in under a year. Most of all we have gained the support of the Curly Continuum!  
If we don't meet our goal of $15K we will use whatever funds we have to go towards production as we seek further investment.   

Other Ways You Can Help
If by chance you are cannot financially contribute to our goal you can still help us bring Diversamē to market.  Word of mouth is what grew It’s a Natural Thang and it can do the same for Diversamē.  Please spread the word about this campaign and why it’s important.  Share the links.  Collect email addresses to help us spread the word! 
Share, share and share again!
Thank you all in advance for your contributions and support!",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><span>Sandra returned to Medina County to be closer to family and finished her graduate work in 2008.

<p><span>She began working for Solutions Behavioral Healthcare as an intern, and was hired as a full-time therapist upon graduation. She has had a rewarding experience there as a counselor for almost five years, but starting her own practice is something she’s always dreamed about. </span></p>

<p><span>On December 18th she went into the hospital for what she thought would be a routine gallbladder operation. But there were problems with the common bile duct, and on the 21st she underwent another surgery. This operation was unsuccessful, and she was transferred to the main campus of Cleveland Clinic. The surgeon there performed another operation on Christmas eve. Biopsies were taken and she was diagnosed with stage 3 pancreatic cancer, and has no medical coverage at this time. </span></p>
<p><span>Sandra is now on chemo therapy and radiation treatment for her cancer. The odds are not in her favor, but as with other challenges in life she is meeting this one head on. She is confident that she will triumph over the disease and return to her dream of helping those afflicted with addiction to alcohol or drugs recover as well. </span></p>
<p><span>Although she is being helped through the HCAP program, and the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, she has many other expenses, including prescription drugs and other medical providers.

<h3>Eight years ago I got carsick. I took a pregnancy test and it came out positive. Then another, then another. All positive. One day I started spotting and went to the OB.  They did an untrasound and could not find a baby in the uterus. We did blood tests that showed that there was little growth and it was growing outside where it should not be and would be a life threatening situation. They gave us medication to end the much wanted pregnancy.  One year later the same thing happened except the medication didnt work. I was carrying my medical records as I was walking down the aisle getting married to my husband because the physician was in fear of the ectopic pregnancy rupturing and me bleeding to death. Five days later I had my left tube removed.  </h3>
<h3>The next year we got pregnant again. We were excited since, with my ""bad"" tube gone we knew the chances of another tubal were low. But it was, and it left me with a severely damaged right tube.</h3>
<h3>We moved on to In Vitro Fertilization.  We got pregnant the first time around but the heartbeat was lost at 9 weeks.  Four months later we tried again and at 4 weeks we lost the baby again in an early miscarriage.</h3>
<h3>So we have two problems with having children. One is the fact that I no longer have functional tubes, and the other is that in the time it's taken us to go through all these ectopics I've gotten older - too old. We can solve both these problems with an egg doner via IVF. But that's expensive.</h3>

<h3>So we need your financial assistance.  We found a wonderful donor and a good clinic. Now we just need the money!</h3>
<h3>What do you get? You get naming rights! If you donate, you get to vote on the name of our child(ren) If you donate more, you pick one of the names that are voted on (my husband and I will also jointly put one - and only one - name on the list).</h3>
<h3>The doctors gives us an 80% chance this will work, and a 20% chance of multiples The total cost is $7000 (we're going out of country to keep costs down), but we can cover most of it. We just need a some help. </h3>
<h3>Also, in the event of multiples, don't worry, you'll get to vote/suggest names twice. :)<span style=""font-size: 1.17em;""><br/></span>

</div>
<div>
<h3>Time is running out this will more than likely be our last attempt in trying to have a child.</h3>
<h3>And if you cannot help, please, contact your insurance companies or just talk to your friends about how IVF should at least be partially covered by health insurance. No one should be denied a family.</h3>

<p>My name
is Dawn Jensen and I have been working on <b>a
way to improve personal safety issues by way of a mobile phone (cell phone) app</b>. </p><p>The app is a personal monitoring system that can let selected friends and loved ones know your movements without the need to get involved in lengthy conversations involving lots of questions. <b>Let parents know</b> when you are going out and when you get home safely, and everyone is happy - no fights, no third degree; and yet the peace of mind that lets you know that you can quickly call for help if it is needed. Or <b>let the kids know</b> you are safe if you live at <b>home alone</b> or are <b>travelling</b>. Quick, easy and discrete messages that keep those close to you in the loop without being obtrusive; and yet have the ability to find you quickly if you need to be found. Out <b>running, cycling, horse-riding or walking</b> alone,<b> Home Safely Now</b> is a must have. It works well for <b>work situations</b> too. If your work involves situations that could get touchy, or if you work late, then this app can be your best friend. There are so many uses for this app. Check out the website - <b><a href=""http://www.homesafelynow.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.homesafelynow.com</a></b> - to find out more about what the app offers.</p><p>And the price! Well, <b>I want this app to be</b> <b>FREE. </b> I want everyone to have the choice to use <b>Home Safely Now</b> - no matter what age,
what gender, what lifestyle, what nationality or what belief system they
have.</p><p>Let's work together to make the world a safer place,without fear of harassment, intimidation or attack. Together we can save lives. At the very least <b>Home Safely Now</b> will allay fears and make for happier, trusting relationships.  </p><p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">I am only one
person. So I need help from other people who see
the value in having </span><b style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">a personal
safety device at their fingertips. </b><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">Please join me in raising money to make this project a reality. I believe that one
person can make a difference - but many people, working together, can change
the world. </span></p><p></p><h3>Become a Hero. Raise money - save lives.</h3><p>It doesn't matter how big or how small your contribution is. From $1 to thousands of dollars - every contribution will help make<b> Home Safely Now</b> an available device. By supporting the <b>Home Safely Now </b>campaign, you know that you are helping to keep yourself, your loved ones and complete strangers a little safer. <b>Become a hero. </b>Join the campaign now. </p><p><b>How much do we need to make this campaign a success?</b> </p><ul>
<li>$63869 is the projected cost of developing the <b>Home Safely Now</b> App; generating a moderate marketing campaign; listing the product for sale in the App Store and on Google Play; and paying for the overheads and running costs for 6 months while we develop and list the App. (I am not drawing a wage from this campaign. Additionally, I am contributing privately to extra administrative costs and to the business setup costs involved in this project. I believe in this business; and I am backing it with whatever private funds I can muster. But I don't have enough to bring the <b>Home Safely Now</b> App to fruition without the help of caring contributors.)</li>
<li>To thank you for your support, inspiration and contributions, we have some exciting PERKS for you. (However, contributions can be made without requiring PERKS, if that is what you would prefer to do.) Even a contribution under $10 will help us towards our goal of creating a safer world. But for a contribution of $10 or greater, you be appointed as a <b>Home Safely Now Hero.</b>  <b>We want to acknowledge our Heroes</b>. <b>See your name on The WEB</b>. For contributions over $25 you will be rewarded with great gifts and/or special experiences. Check out our PERKS section for full details.  </li>
<li>The <b>Home Safely Now </b>campaign is a <b>Flexible Funding Campaign</b>. Having stepped out of our comfort zones to start this campaign, my team and I are committed to making it work. I am determined to develop this app to its full potential, and success in this campaign will make that happen sooner. Raising less than the $63869, will mean that the worldwide roll out of this App will be slower. (We are starting in Australia, testing and improving the app here. But we expect to quickly roll it out to Europe, USA, Canada, and New Zealand within 18 months; and to Asia and the rest of the world within 30 months.) <b>The more help we receive, the quicker we can work to keep people safer in all countries.</b> As long as we can show support for the project, we can apply for traditional lending and funding, if we need to. So, any amount of support will catapult us towards ultimate success. </li>

I'd like it to be FREE.
My name
is Dawn Jensen and I have been working on a
way to improve personal safety issues by way of a mobile phone (cell phone) app. The app is a personal monitoring system that can let selected friends and loved ones know your movements without the need to get involved in lengthy conversations involving lots of questions. Let parents know when you are going out and when you get home safely, and everyone is happy - no fights, no third degree; and yet the peace of mind that lets you know that you can quickly call for help if it is needed. Or let the kids know you are safe if you live at home alone or are travelling. Quick, easy and discrete messages that keep those close to you in the loop without being obtrusive; and yet have the ability to find you quickly if you need to be found. Out running, cycling, horse-riding or walking alone, Home Safely Now is a must have. It works well for work situations too. If your work involves situations that could get touchy, or if you work late, then this app can be your best friend. There are so many uses for this app. Check out the website - www.homesafelynow.com - to find out more about what the app offers.And the price! Well, I want this app to be FREE.  I want everyone to have the choice to use Home Safely Now - no matter what age,
what gender, what lifestyle, what nationality or what belief system they
have.Let's work together to make the world a safer place,without fear of harassment, intimidation or attack. Together we can save lives. At the very least Home Safely Now will allay fears and make for happier, trusting relationships.  I am only one
person. So I need help from other people who see
the value in having a personal
safety device at their fingertips. Please join me in raising money to make this project a reality. I believe that one
person can make a difference - but many people, working together, can change
the world. Become a Hero. Raise money - save lives.It doesn't matter how big or how small your contribution is. From $1 to thousands of dollars - every contribution will help make Home Safely Now an available device. By supporting the Home Safely Now campaign, you know that you are helping to keep yourself, your loved ones and complete strangers a little safer. Become a hero. Join the campaign now. How much do we need to make this campaign a success? 
$63869 is the projected cost of developing the Home Safely Now App; generating a moderate marketing campaign; listing the product for sale in the App Store and on Google Play; and paying for the overheads and running costs for 6 months while we develop and list the App. (I am not drawing a wage from this campaign. Additionally, I am contributing privately to extra administrative costs and to the business setup costs involved in this project. I believe in this business; and I am backing it with whatever private funds I can muster. But I don't have enough to bring the Home Safely Now App to fruition without the help of caring contributors.)
To thank you for your support, inspiration and contributions, we have some exciting PERKS for you. (However, contributions can be made without requiring PERKS, if that is what you would prefer to do.) Even a contribution under $10 will help us towards our goal of creating a safer world. But for a contribution of $10 or greater, you be appointed as a Home Safely Now Hero.  We want to acknowledge our Heroes. See your name on The WEB. For contributions over $25 you will be rewarded with great gifts and/or special experiences. Check out our PERKS section for full details.  
The Home Safely Now campaign is a Flexible Funding Campaign. Having stepped out of our comfort zones to start this campaign, my team and I are committed to making it work. I am determined to develop this app to its full potential, and success in this campaign will make that happen sooner. Raising less than the $63869, will mean that the worldwide roll out of this App will be slower. (We are starting in Australia, testing and improving the app here. But we expect to quickly roll it out to Europe, USA, Canada, and New Zealand within 18 months; and to Asia and the rest of the world within 30 months.) The more help we receive, the quicker we can work to keep people safer in all countries. As long as we can show support for the project, we can apply for traditional lending and funding, if we need to. So, any amount of support will catapult us towards ultimate success. 
Home Safely Now has great PartnersAt Home Safely Now, we believe that life should be fun; and everyone should be
able to work, play, travel, meet people, party, and live safely - without fear
of harassment, intimidation or attack.
Our motto says it all:The strong should not harm the weak; and the weak
should not harm the strong. We have partnered with the successful developers at Buzinga Apps to develop a user-friendly, reliable, secure device that will continue to be upgraded as demand changes and as more research reveals trends and requirements. Home Safely Now is backed by the latest Cloud technology to assure users that the best possible security backup is at hand. Easy to use and with potential for quick adaptation to world-wide coverage, Home Safely Now will be the new must-have app.We have secured the assistance of other professionals who will advise, support and contract to deliver a superior Phone App and associated media. By supporting our campaign, you can help protect other people like you. Maybe you will even help save lives. Be one of our Heroes.

The total funds needed to cover the costs listed above totals $13,000. Our total projected costs for the Congress event total almost $19,000 and we need the support of our community to help us cover these costs. We are prioritizing sponsoring our indigenous delegates due to their limited economic resources that may prevent them from attending if their costs are not covered by our organization. If we do not raise 100% of the funds, we will limit the number of participants that we will sponsor in order to remain within our budget. We will do everything we can to minimize expenses and find less expensive alternatives to allow for representation from each of the indigenous nations we've listed.A Wixarika leader and Lance Long, Po-Chunk tribal leader at the 2010 Congress. 

This year’s congress titled, “Sacred Plants, Culture, and Human Rights”, will take place on the campus of the Department of Anthropology at the Autonomous University of the State of Mexico, April 3-5th in Toluca, Mexico and will be attended by international scientists, doctors, academics, government representatives, and indigenous leaders from North & South America. A declaration will be drafted as a result of the congress to continue our advocacy efforts to bring these plant medicines out from the shadow of prohibition and into the light of research and therapeutic application.
The time has never been as critical as now for us to take a stand against the erroneous classification of traditional medicines and sacred plants, and to work together to build new models of intercultural medicine and exchange for the benefit of human health.  Please consider making a donation to our Indiegogo campaign to support our 2014 congress and help us meet our goal of raising $13,000.
You can still participate in the congress as a participant. We are currently finalizing our program of keynote speakers and conference presenters. For more information please visit our website at www.nierika.info.

What Does it Do?
</p>
<p style=""color: #909090; font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"">
Well as simply put as possible, it kind of does everything. With LifeLink it's not about how much it does (because it does a lot!) but the way in which it does these things. The main goal is to link everything together and provide a single, simple, cohesive organization experience for everyone.
</p>
<p style=""color: #39b54a; font-size: 26px; line-height: 28px; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"">
Calendar
</p>
<p style=""color: #909090; font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"">
In LifeLink, everything revolves around the calendar, since in reality, everything revolves around time. The calendar has all of the functionality that you would expect it to have from any other calendar app but shines in its ability to pull data from every corner of the LifeLink app. 
</p>
<p style=""color: #39b54a; font-size: 26px; line-height: 28px; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"">
School
</p>
<p style=""color: #909090; font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"">
LifeLink is the ultimate school organizer tool. It keeps track of your class schedule, homework assignments, test dates, extracurricular activities and everything in between. Because everything is linked together, homework assignments automatically are added to your reminders and your class schedule is automatically added to your calendar, making it unlike anything else!

LifeLink Forecast (Stress)
</p>
<p style=""color: #909090; font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"">
LifeLink includes a neat little feature called the LifeLink Forecast. LifeLink Forecast uses a hierarchical system of equations and algorithms to give you an idea of how stressful the upcoming day or week is expected to be. It even has a ""zoom"" view so you can see approximately how stressful your day will be hour by hour. Forecast operates in the now, so the moment you add a new assignment or new task, Forecast will update itself to reflect the changes.
<br/><br/>
We put a lot of time and thought into this little feature. In fact, we spent more time and effort on Forecast than on any other part of LifeLink. It is such a little feature but it is one that defines LifeLink as a whole. Forecast shows off the amazing things that are possible with LifeLink. It's what makes it a truly smart organizer.

The Vision
</p>
<p style=""color: #909090; font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"">
The idea behind LifeLink was to create something truly unique and useful. We want to build something that would really benefit people, and this is how LifeLink was born. LifeLink will be the most powerful organization tool that there is. It is in essence, the organizer of organizers. No overlapping functionality, no fragmentation of functionality and no nonsense. The main goal we have in mind with LifeLink is to finally provide a simple, cohesive, and pleasant organization experience that is powerful enough to organize everything you throw at it.

“3-Dimensional Software”
</p>
<p style=""color: #909090; font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"">
Software in its current state operates mostly in what we call “2-dimensional processing”. It hones in on one thing at a time, such as being solely a calendar, solely a reminder list, or solely a financial tracker. It’s like a sphere, if you look at in 2-dimensions, it looks like a circle, but there is so much more to it than that. Software has recently began to incorporate some “3-dimensional processing” which recognizes that a there is more than one side to things. A calendar event is not just a calendar event. It fits into other categories and has influence over other things and is itself influenced by other things.  Perhaps the best example of this would be an appointment for a visit to the doctor. In our minds we are not just thinking of the time of the appointment and the location. We are also thinking about how much the appointment will cost us, how it may conflict with other events in our lives, and how it fits into the grand scheme of things. This is the type of processing that we have designed LifeLink to perform. This is the type of process that attempts to mimic the way that we think. 
</p>

The Campaign
</p>
<p style=""color: #909090; font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"">
LifeLink is a pretty large project. Each individual part of the app has the amount of functionality that a single standalone app has, and there are 10 or more portions of LifeLink fit that description. Our team in its current state, would take roughly 5 years to complete it on our own. That’s simply too long which is why we have turned to you for some help. We would like to bring in developers to greatly speed up the process. 
<br/><br/>
We would like to put together 10 small groups of developers to handle the development of each part of the app simultaneously. This would allow us to get LifeLink finished in about a year. The design and user interface have already been completed, which is one big check off the list, and the math behind it has been completed as well, leaving only the programming to be done. We essentially have the entire blueprint of the app completed and we simply need it to be constructed by developers. 
<br/><br/>
We feel like LifeLink is far more than just another app. It’s a train of thought; something that would inspire others and help move software in the right direction.

</p>
<p style=""color: #909090; font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"">
We're going to be completely upfront and honest here. LifeLink will take some time to get out to you. (Read ""The Campaign"" above for more information) Our target launch date for the Beta is June 21, 2014. We feel like it should be ready for public betas by then, though we cannot make any firm promise that it will launch on this date. We will keep you updated on the progress of LifeLink and will announce the Beta launch date in mid-April.

When is LifeLink expected to be completed?
</p>
<p style=""color: #909090; font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"">
Our goal is to launch LifeLink to the public on November 27, 2014 (exactly 1 year after the launch of this campaign). Please keep in mind that this is only our target launch date and is subject to change. We will not release a half-baked product and will take as much time as is necessary to complete a quality product.
</p>
<p style=""color: #39b54a; font-size: 26px; line-height: 28px; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"">
Why is there a limited amount of Beta access?
</p>
<p style=""color: #909090; font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"">
We have decided to limit the number of people who can sign up for the Beta in order to ensure that there is no overload when the Beta launches. We want to make sure that we can have the app tested without causing too much traffic and it will make it a bit easier for us to manage.

<br/></p></div>","What Does it Do?


Well as simply put as possible, it kind of does everything. With LifeLink it's not about how much it does (because it does a lot!) but the way in which it does these things. The main goal is to link everything together and provide a single, simple, cohesive organization experience for everyone.


Calendar


In LifeLink, everything revolves around the calendar, since in reality, everything revolves around time. The calendar has all of the functionality that you would expect it to have from any other calendar app but shines in its ability to pull data from every corner of the LifeLink app. 


School


LifeLink is the ultimate school organizer tool. It keeps track of your class schedule, homework assignments, test dates, extracurricular activities and everything in between. Because everything is linked together, homework assignments automatically are added to your reminders and your class schedule is automatically added to your calendar, making it unlike anything else! 


Work


Reminders


Diet


Exercise


Sleep


Finances

Social


Notes


LifeLink Forecast (Stress)


LifeLink includes a neat little feature called the LifeLink Forecast. LifeLink Forecast uses a hierarchical system of equations and algorithms to give you an idea of how stressful the upcoming day or week is expected to be. It even has a ""zoom"" view so you can see approximately how stressful your day will be hour by hour. Forecast operates in the now, so the moment you add a new assignment or new task, Forecast will update itself to reflect the changes.

We put a lot of time and thought into this little feature. In fact, we spent more time and effort on Forecast than on any other part of LifeLink. It is such a little feature but it is one that defines LifeLink as a whole. Forecast shows off the amazing things that are possible with LifeLink. It's what makes it a truly smart organizer. 


The Vision


The idea behind LifeLink was to create something truly unique and useful. We want to build something that would really benefit people, and this is how LifeLink was born. LifeLink will be the most powerful organization tool that there is. It is in essence, the organizer of organizers. No overlapping functionality, no fragmentation of functionality and no nonsense. The main goal we have in mind with LifeLink is to finally provide a simple, cohesive, and pleasant organization experience that is powerful enough to organize everything you throw at it.  


“3-Dimensional Software”


Software in its current state operates mostly in what we call “2-dimensional processing”. It hones in on one thing at a time, such as being solely a calendar, solely a reminder list, or solely a financial tracker. It’s like a sphere, if you look at in 2-dimensions, it looks like a circle, but there is so much more to it than that. Software has recently began to incorporate some “3-dimensional processing” which recognizes that a there is more than one side to things. A calendar event is not just a calendar event. It fits into other categories and has influence over other things and is itself influenced by other things.  Perhaps the best example of this would be an appointment for a visit to the doctor. In our minds we are not just thinking of the time of the appointment and the location. We are also thinking about how much the appointment will cost us, how it may conflict with other events in our lives, and how it fits into the grand scheme of things. This is the type of processing that we have designed LifeLink to perform. This is the type of process that attempts to mimic the way that we think. 


The Campaign


LifeLink is a pretty large project. Each individual part of the app has the amount of functionality that a single standalone app has, and there are 10 or more portions of LifeLink fit that description. Our team in its current state, would take roughly 5 years to complete it on our own. That’s simply too long which is why we have turned to you for some help. We would like to bring in developers to greatly speed up the process. 

We would like to put together 10 small groups of developers to handle the development of each part of the app simultaneously. This would allow us to get LifeLink finished in about a year. The design and user interface have already been completed, which is one big check off the list, and the math behind it has been completed as well, leaving only the programming to be done. We essentially have the entire blueprint of the app completed and we simply need it to be constructed by developers. 

We feel like LifeLink is far more than just another app. It’s a train of thought; something that would inspire others and help move software in the right direction.

Frequently Asked Questions


What’s left to do?


We have completed the design of the application for Android, IOS, and The web (finishing up the design for Windows Phone and Windows RT). We have also completed nearly all of the math behind it. Essentially we have the completed blueprint and are in the process of constructing it.


When will the LifeLink Beta version be released to contributors?


We're going to be completely upfront and honest here. LifeLink will take some time to get out to you. (Read ""The Campaign"" above for more information) Our target launch date for the Beta is June 21, 2014. We feel like it should be ready for public betas by then, though we cannot make any firm promise that it will launch on this date. We will keep you updated on the progress of LifeLink and will announce the Beta launch date in mid-April.



When is LifeLink expected to be completed?


Our goal is to launch LifeLink to the public on November 27, 2014 (exactly 1 year after the launch of this campaign). Please keep in mind that this is only our target launch date and is subject to change. We will not release a half-baked product and will take as much time as is necessary to complete a quality product.


Why is there a limited amount of Beta access?


We have decided to limit the number of people who can sign up for the Beta in order to ensure that there is no overload when the Beta launches. We want to make sure that we can have the app tested without causing too much traffic and it will make it a bit easier for us to manage.


Other Ways You Can Help Us


We understand that there are many of you who would like to see LifeLink become a reality but are unable to contribute to the project financially. We would first like to thank you for giving us a moment of your time and taking a look at our project. It would also be greatly appreciated if you could just share this page with your friends and family to help us spread the word. 

If you are a developer and have what it takes to work on the LifeLink team, then we want you! Starting January 15, 2014, we will begin recruiting developers to join our team. If you are interested, please send an email to nujra01@gmail.com for more information. 

We would like to thank everyone that has contributed to the project in any way, whether it be financially or just passing the word along. You are helping us make LifeLink a reality and that is something that we could never thank you enough for!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Hermo Malaguit, the inventor of sink magic. I care about my family, my world community,  and the environment I have been a healthcare worker for over 24 years.l help assist in providing diagnosis to multitudes of hospital patients.</p>
<p>I am passionate about water conservation and I want to soraed the word out there that sink magic will help save at least 40 gallons per day per household, that a whopping 14,600 gallons per year, imaging 1 million people using sink magic, the water saving is astronomical!( approximately 14.6 Billion gallons per year )</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The magnitude of the benefits  from a small gadget and a small amount of $30 will create a grass root movement collectively help in saving massive amount of water yearly! And as a side benefit, since dishwashing is easier, people do not have to buy non-biodegradable disposable plates to throw in landfills, saving us precious landfill real estate for the future generation!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We need $30 contribution and you will get a single unit of Sink magic PSWD.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The funding will be apportioned into professional marketing and product education of people just like the other known name brands.</p>
<p>The uniqueness of the perks is not the """"price""  but the knowlege and deep emotion you are letting go and expressing. When you contibute, I can assure you that you will be satisfied with your decision. When you use sink magic, you are on your way to reducing water consumption for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>Our goal, whether we reached it or not, we will find a way to keep educatiing people in water conservation. There is a saying ""Ignorance is not an excuse, but Knowlege is power!"" </p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I am sending an appeal to our many friends who are deeply concerned about the environment and overall wasteful water over usage. Please use sink magic and see how must you can help reduce water usage.</p>

<p> Let me introduce you to SinkMagic.  As a Mom, if you are like me, You start a project and always get the “Hey Mom come here for a second”.  This is an awesome product for all of you Moms out there that want/need to save time with a mundane chore such as dish washing.  This innovative device is a portable sink water diverter.  This product will provide ease and convenience through the automatic creation of a basin as you wash your dishes enabling rapid completion of your chore.<br/><br/><strong>     3 easy ways you use Sink Magic</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Plug n Go Technique- means you do not need to make a basin of water, after plugging in Sink Magic, you start washing immediately.  You will find that the water will automatically collect into a basin which aids in pre-soaking the other dishes while you scrub the other.  You will also notice that the water will keep replenishing without overflowing, It’s like magic.</li>
<li>Plug n Soak Technique- How many of us cannot find the time to do things we need to do?  This technique is very handy when you don’t have time to  to wash the dishes after your meal.  This is not an issue, simply plug in Sink Magic. You will create a create a basin, soak your dirty dishes and leave.  You can then come back to complete the chore when you have the time.  </li>

</ul>
<p>          Please watch the video to see for yourself exactly how Sink Magic works.  This video was made by and with the inventor of the product.</p>
<p>   This video and the product really impressed me.  I remember the old way I used to wash dishes.  I would stick that metal drain plug, fill with water and soak my dishes.  When I had the time to come back to them, the water would be cold and nasty.  I would have to stick my hand in that ucky water to pull the plug so I could start washing the dishes.  If I would start washing right away the sink would over flow and that would be a big mistake.  This is where Sink Magic comes into play.  The Sink Magic way is so easy.  Wet, Plug and Use.  If I had did this from the start, I would be done.  Same pile of dirty dishes, created a basin for the dirty dishes up to the brim.  No time to wash, soak them and come back later.  When you come back, all you have to do is lift the dish and start washing immediately.  Their is no sticking your hands in cold ucky water, The warm water you use will warm the cold water and feel very nice on your hands.  You just saved time, money and effort.  Do not forget the soapy dish goes to the opposite sink where the third and final rinse will take place.  The water will be soapy clean and can be used as a soaker for future dirty dishes.</p>
<p> I highly recommend this product to all Moms.  We have so much on our plates(no pun intended) and our time is at a premium.  You want to save time anywhere you can.  This product does just that.  I am a creature of habit.  I really dislike change but Sink Magic has changed my life for the for the better.  Spending time with my family and not being rushed to complete these kind of tasks, has really helped.  It is really a fun product.  I even have my kids taught how to use it.  Yes, they are young but this is a chore they are happy to help with.  They think it is very fun.</p>

My name is Hermo Malaguit, the inventor of sink magic. I care about my family, my world community,  and the environment I have been a healthcare worker for over 24 years.l help assist in providing diagnosis to multitudes of hospital patients.
I am passionate about water conservation and I want to soraed the word out there that sink magic will help save at least 40 gallons per day per household, that a whopping 14,600 gallons per year, imaging 1 million people using sink magic, the water saving is astronomical!( approximately 14.6 Billion gallons per year )

The magnitude of the benefits  from a small gadget and a small amount of $30 will create a grass root movement collectively help in saving massive amount of water yearly! And as a side benefit, since dishwashing is easier, people do not have to buy non-biodegradable disposable plates to throw in landfills, saving us precious landfill real estate for the future generation!
 
We need $30 contribution and you will get a single unit of Sink magic PSWD.



The funding will be apportioned into professional marketing and product education of people just like the other known name brands.
The uniqueness of the perks is not the """"price""  but the knowlege and deep emotion you are letting go and expressing. When you contibute, I can assure you that you will be satisfied with your decision. When you use sink magic, you are on your way to reducing water consumption for the rest of your life.
Our goal, whether we reached it or not, we will find a way to keep educatiing people in water conservation. There is a saying ""Ignorance is not an excuse, but Knowlege is power!"" 



The Impact
I am sending an appeal to our many friends who are deeply concerned about the environment and overall wasteful water over usage. Please use sink magic and see how must you can help reduce water usage.
Please read and follow the links of many bloggers who have experience sink magic convenience. You will be amazed about what they are saying.

<h3><strong>The Boston Riot: Who We Are, and How We Got Here</strong></h3>
<p><strong><br/>The Boston Riot</strong> is the story of a collection of dedicated young quidditch players out of Boston, Massachusetts. The team originated in Fall 2012, as a ""B"" team for Emerson College headed up by captain Ben Nadeau to accommodate the level of talent at the college. However, the group became independent under the leadership of coach <strong>Rose Pleuler</strong>, assistant coach <strong>Jackson Maher</strong> (of Emerson College Quidditch) and co-captains <strong>Todd Mitchell</strong> and <strong>Jagger Kugler.</strong> The Riot set their eyes on World Cup VI and said: <strong>We can do this.</strong> The team has flourished with the enthusiasm and dedication shown by each and every member of the team. </p>
<p>With other Northeast powerhouses such as Emerson, Boston University, and Tufts in the area, the Riot has learned quickly from defeat, and are a stronger team for it. <strong>Inherent underdogs, the Riot knows how to have fun and also how to compete at a high level.</strong></p>
<p>The Riot reached the Northeast Regional tournament hopeful but aware of the obstacles ahead. After all, only 11 teams would qualify for World Cup, and we had veterans BU and RIT in our pool on the first day. But we started off the day with momentum, beating the Badassalisks 80*-0 and RPI 150*-0. We left Day 1 third in our pool.</p>
<p>That meant on Day 2, if we could win our first game, we would qualify for World Cup. It was within reach. Our opponent: University of Rochester, who had ended Day 1 first in their pool, and ranked 5th overall. Thus began the most nerve-racking and exciting game of quidditch we have played to date. Relying on a scrappy defense with keeper <strong>Tyler Trudeau</strong> and seasoned beaters (to name a couple) <strong>Bobby O'Neil</strong> and <strong>Rebecca Contreres</strong>, we kept the score low. After our first snitch grab by seeker <strong>Brandon Cardwell</strong> was called off, we were able to make our victory official with a grab by seeker/keeper <strong>Louie Contino</strong>, winning the game 50*-40.</p>
<p><strong>The Boston Riot is officially World Cup bound.</strong></p>
<p>The team couldn't have dreamed of a more amazing quidditch experience. <strong>However, we have been unable to fully fund our way, and our opportunity to compete at World Cup VI is in jeapordy. We need your support to get there.</strong></p>

<h3>A note about funding</h3>
<p>Unlike other online platforms (such as Kickstarter), this is a ""Flexible Funding"" campaign, which means that we receive all contributions, whether or not we hit our goal. <strong>But the more we receive, the more we are able to achieve. Thank you so much for your support!</strong></p>
<h3>The pitch</h3>
<p><strong>Who we are:</strong> A revolutionary performance ensemble that continues to seek to change the face of performance, offering aspects of performance that lie beyond the mask of popular culture.</p>
<p><strong>What we need:</strong> Support with completing several projects, including music recordings, videos, and a documentary, that are integral to us gaining visibility and developing global exhibition and performance opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>What we offer: </strong>We are committed to our art and will continue to invoke vulnerability, pursue authenticity, and reveal what is possible (and in some instances, what is impossible) in performance, art, and our daily lives. And for this campaign, we are offering a range of creative perks that allow various levels of immersion into our art and creative process.</p>

<h3>About Bad Unkl Sista</h3>
<p>Having grown up teaching alongside my mother in the dance studio adjoining my house, I experienced dance as a part of my daily life. I continue to dance, choreograph, design wearable art (""couture""), build art installations, and evolve both as an artist and as a human being. I have remained unconditionally devoted to my creative practice for over 25 years, and my commitment to art and community keeps expanding each day.</p>
<p><span><span>I founded Bad Unkl Sista ten years ago. We utilize elements of Japanese Butoh, physical theater, and other influences to create unique fusions of music, movement, costuming, and theater. Our performances strive to defy categorization and move each witness to a state of extraordinary and memorable being.</span></span></p>

<h3>Our campaign</h3>
<p>Bad Unkl Sista is at a critical point in our growth. In 2011, Goyo Aranaga joined Bad Unkl Sista as Music Director. Adding live original music to our productions has created a perfect extension to the Bad Unkl Sista performance aesthetic. In 2012, we staged an opera-scale production, ""First Breath - Last Breath"" and realized a new level of potential.

<h3>How funding will be used</h3>
<p>We are seeking to raise $25,000 to finance completion of many projects (using material from our 2012 production ""First Breath - Last Breath"") that will be used to promote Bad Unk Sista Sista and support 2013 tour bookings:</p>
<p>- <strong>Original music (CD + download)</strong>. This 70+ minute release has already been recorded and mixed, and is awaiting mastering and duplication ($2,000).</p>
<p>- <strong>Remixes (CD + download)</strong>. 20+ wildly talented and wonderful DJs and producers have signed up to create their own personalized reflections of our recorded material. Needed: mastering and duplication ($3,000).</p>
<p>- <strong>Concert video</strong>. Hours of high-definition footage shot during ""First Breath - Last Breath"" will be edited and finished, resulting in an 8-10 minute video of performance highlights ($5,000).</p>
<p>- <strong>Music video</strong>. Additional footage from other projects will be crafted into our first video featuring Bad Unkl Sista original music ($4,000).</p>
<p>- <strong>Documentary</strong>. A camera crew followed us for two months as we concepted, choreographed, designed, composed, rehearsed, and staged ""First Breath - Last Breath"". We are now in our second round of editing, and will use funds to complete audio and video post-production ($3,500).</p>
<p>- <strong>Image licensing</strong>. <span>Funds will enable us to license images</span> from the photographer who documented the show and has done amazing work for us over the years ($1,000).</p>
<p>- <strong>Press kit design and presentation</strong>. We will design and develop both online (digital) and offline (printed) versions of our press kit ($1,500).</p>
<p>We will also be working with a publicist to distribute the our materials. The intention is to broaden our audience, culturally and professionally. We already have three confirmed spring performances in Europe — Copenhagen, Amsterdam, and London — and want to expand from there. We are also exploring museum installations and conducting workshops and teaching programs that include physical theater, Butoh and music. The remainder of the funds ($5,000) will help support this effort.</p>
<p>Our <strong>CD release party</strong> is scheduled for December 18, 2012 at Z Space in San Francisco. This will include an intimate performance by Bad Unkl Sista and the premiere screening of our documentary. <strong>Supporters at all levels will receive a special invitation to this event!</strong></p>

A note about funding
Unlike other online platforms (such as Kickstarter), this is a ""Flexible Funding"" campaign, which means that we receive all contributions, whether or not we hit our goal. But the more we receive, the more we are able to achieve. Thank you so much for your support!
The pitch
Who we are: A revolutionary performance ensemble that continues to seek to change the face of performance, offering aspects of performance that lie beyond the mask of popular culture.
What we need: Support with completing several projects, including music recordings, videos, and a documentary, that are integral to us gaining visibility and developing global exhibition and performance opportunities.
What we offer: We are committed to our art and will continue to invoke vulnerability, pursue authenticity, and reveal what is possible (and in some instances, what is impossible) in performance, art, and our daily lives. And for this campaign, we are offering a range of creative perks that allow various levels of immersion into our art and creative process.
 

About Bad Unkl Sista
Having grown up teaching alongside my mother in the dance studio adjoining my house, I experienced dance as a part of my daily life. I continue to dance, choreograph, design wearable art (""couture""), build art installations, and evolve both as an artist and as a human being. I have remained unconditionally devoted to my creative practice for over 25 years, and my commitment to art and community keeps expanding each day.
I founded Bad Unkl Sista ten years ago. We utilize elements of Japanese Butoh, physical theater, and other influences to create unique fusions of music, movement, costuming, and theater. Our performances strive to defy categorization and move each witness to a state of extraordinary and memorable being.
 

Our campaign
Bad Unkl Sista is at a critical point in our growth. In 2011, Goyo Aranaga joined Bad Unkl Sista as Music Director. Adding live original music to our productions has created a perfect extension to the Bad Unkl Sista performance aesthetic. In 2012, we staged an opera-scale production, ""First Breath - Last Breath"" and realized a new level of potential. We are now capable of presenting our work at a much larger scale, and are ready for a broader audience.
We are working on several essential projects, including music recordings, videos, and a documentary, that are integral to us gaining visibility and developing opportunities with promoters, museums, festivals, and large-scale projects — locally and around the world.
After years of dedication to our art and service to community, our vision is within reach!
