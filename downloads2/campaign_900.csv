<h3><u>BALETT MÉCANIQUE</u></h3>
<p>We are a group of young artist from Portugal, France and Brazil that lives in Portugal and works with goal to create and materialize ideas. <br/>Ballet Mécanique received partial funding from the Burning Man Arts Grant but we need your help to complete the finance of the project and help us expand this approach to even more projects.</p>
</div><div>
<p>This interactive project aims to seeks a kaleidoscopic perception of inside out space. As the individual makes the structure spin, him self runs too.The fragments of mirror that compose the form create a metamorphose of images that suround it, images that shange acording to the moviment of the dome.<br/>Together, by spining the structure, each person can take their own perception of the space, with a bunch of mutant images that will (re)construct a (new) reality. Here the individual by puting the real in transformation arrives to a non convencional way of seeing, between the objective and subjective world.</p>
<p>This installation is based on the creation of a perceptive kaleidoscopic system of space, for an illusory, abstract, hypnotic and timeless thought about it. Is through a structure made up of mirror fragments and their upward / downward movement, as well as the rotational movement of the structure itself, that the reflections and the light will conceive a challenge to the perception of the image of the ""real"" by exploiting a space-time labyrinth consciousness for the one who interacts with it. This developed labyrinthine consciousness is the epigraph for the intended surrealist atmosphere, which is based on the cinematography of Man Ray in ""Le Ballet Méchanique"" (1924) by Fernand Léger.</p>
<p>This relation, exercised by both the mirror-modifying force and the complexity of the movement, summoning the dream-one draws the tenuous line between reality and illusion, the mirror where being and matter, eye and atmosphere are confused.<br/><br/>The refletions preserve the enigma,<br/>time provokes thought,<br/>and movement creates the imaginary.</p>

<p>I’m interested in using yarn as my new painting medium. I’ve been working on a latch hook rug for the past few months. The process of latch hooking requires knotting each strand of yarn one at a time. There are tricks to make the process faster, but even still it’s not fast enough! My current latch hook rug is about 10% finished.</p>
<p>With your help, I’ll purchase a hand tufting machine to make the rug making process exponentially faster! I estimate that I could finish a 3ft x 4ft a rug in a few days to a week rather than months to a year!</p>
<p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Your generous donations will go towards purchasing the hand tufting machine and materials. The machine will cost around $750 plus shipping. My budget for rug backing, yarn, and threads will be around $300. Altogether, my goal is to raise $1,050.</p>
<p>I would love to raise funds by donations and pre-orders. I will offer a few perks for your donations: rug wall-hangings, rug coasters, pom-pom keychains, and postcard packs of paintings and drawings. Pre-orders and perks will be sent out once enough funds are raised to purchase the machine.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-ordered rugs will come in various sizes:</strong></p>
<p>X-Small: Coaster pack of 4</p>
<p>Small: 17in x 24in (wall-hanging option)</p>
<p>Medium: 3ft x 4ft (wall-hanging option)</p>
<p>Large: 5ft x 8ft</p>
<p>Extra-Large: 8ft x 10ft</p>
<p>Once the rugs are made, an email with photos of the finished rugs will be emailed to all buyers. Rugs will be claimed on a first-come first-served basis. Announcements will be made closer to the date about exact time the email will be sent. </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>If you cannot afford to help monetarily, you can help by spreading the word and sharing this page on facebook, Instagram, email, twitter, etc! I'm also accepting yarn donations for any unused yarn you would like to give away.</p>
<p>Thank you for your support! Excited to get started on this new project!</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>We are the Metonymy Collective, a group of artist who work across disciplines to create multimedia performances, installations and community spaces. Our goal is to explore the empty places. We dance with the multiple story lines of history. To accomplish this task we utilize memory as a catalyst for art and community actions.</p>
<p>While we have previously created out art with our owns funds, our current project is expanding more rapidly then we anticipated. It is for this reason that we are starting this campaign to help support <a href=""http://www.metane.me/memoryflowwaterofboston"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Memory Flow/Water of Boston</a>. Boston's drinking water flows over a history of colonization and forced evacuation. In performance the revives layers of memory and systemic violence that are submerged under the Quabbin Reservoir. A labyrinthine structure of plastic membranes, pictures suspended in water, paper cuts and masked performers, will turn the performance space into a memory chamber.  The audience navigate the space, exploring the depths of a drowned history.</p>
<p>Your support will allow us build the last stages of the labyrinth and prepare it to be exhibited in future venues. Our upcoming performance will occur on February 24th during <a href=""http://xfestma.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Xfest</a>, which this year will occur in the <a href=""https://dorchesterartproject.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dorchester Art Project</a>, Boston.

<h3>The Larger Picture</h3>
<p>Memory Flow/Water of Boston is only the beginning of a multifaceted collaboration that explores forced depopulation and environmental destruction in Western Massachusetts, through the lens of land and water rights. It will manifest in a series of art/historical exhibitions, performances, and town hall discussions. The project will primarily focus on the Quabbin reservoir, and the history that lies under its surface. </p>
<p>The Quabbin area has previously been inhabited by Native American Nations. They were violently displaced by the pioneer towns built in the area. Greater Boston Area’s water needs were the second agent that pushed the area to be depopulated and reshaped through the forces of capital and “public interest.”</p>
<p>Through combination of art and discussion we hope to draw parallels with future environmental and human realities. Awareness regarding the topic of water consumption and water rights are the not isolated to reality of the Quabbin reservoir.  From the Water Protectors in North Dakota to the Pacific Islands on the brink of destruction, water flow has always been a global issue. The different events will thus use the medium of history to weave together a conversation that feeds into current political action. Thank you for being part of this conversation.</p>

<p>If money is hard to come by, we completely understand. However, if you are interested in collaborating in any shape and form, we very welcome to working with you.

<h3>Help make The Harlow accessible</h3>
<p>The Harlow’s new home at 100 Water Street, just down the street from our old location is the perfect building for an art-space. It has two floors and multiple rooms, doubling our exhibition capacity, we now have dedicated workshop space, a new craft shop and accessible bathrooms on each floor.  It’s much larger than our original home, and this has allowed us to expand programming to better serve the central Maine community. Our main gallery space is up a flight of stairs so it is essential that we install a wheelchair in the lobby to allow people with mobility challenges to enjoy our art exhibitions and events. We want to be able to welcome everyone in the community into our new space to enjoy the arts, including the 16% of Mainers who have some type of disability. We all know that the population of the state Maine is one of the oldest in the nation, and more and more of us are chosing to age in place. Our little city of Hallowell alone has multiple elderly housing facilities.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Phase 1: Give us a Lift!</h3>
<p>Since early this year we have been working with consultants to determine the best, safest and most effective solutions to make the main gallery space fully accessible. We’ll be installing a professional grade wheelchair lift in the front lobby by mid 2019 or even sooner, if fundraising goes well! We’ll select one of three Maine-based ADA approved companies who have provided us with advice, recommendations and quotes to fine tune their design and specifications and complete the work as soon as we reach our fundraising goals. </p>
<p>There is a good chance that the new sidewalks being installed this summer by MaineDOT as part of the Water Street reconstruction will provide us with an accessible front entrance, and one of the parking spaces in front of our building will be designated handicapped parking with a cut curb for sidewalk access. The timing is perfect!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Phase 2: lower level access</h3>
<p>If we surpass our goal, funding will go to “Phase 2” of our accessibility project, which is to either install a stair chair or ramp to provide access to the lower level exhibition and workshop space via the front or side entrance.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>A little history</h3>
<p>The Harlow Gallery is owned and operated by the Kennebec Valley Art Association (KVAA), a 501(c)3 membership-based nonprofit founded in 1958. The KVAA opened the Harlow Gallery in downtown historic Hallowell in 1963, and thousands of Maine artists have shown their work at The Harlow over the intervening decades.</p>
<p>The Harlow embodies central Maine’s grassroots arts community with its diversity of art forms, welcoming atmosphere and spirit of experimentation and creativity. We are a vitally important cultural touchstone not just for Augusta, Hallowell, Gardiner, but for all the surrounding rural communities. While we primarily serve central Maine as an arts and cultural center, we are a known destination for artists and art lovers from statewide and beyond, attracting over 7,000 visitors annually resulting in direct economic benefits to the region. The Harlow Gallery was designated “Best Gallery in Maine 2015” by readers of Down East Magazine by popular vote.</p>
<p>Our mission is to connect and celebrate art, artists and community. We believe the arts are integral to a well-rounded society and so offer exhibitions, lectures, poetry readings, workshops, performances and more. Artists and community groups use the Harlow for meetings and cultural events and we offer opportunities for artist networking and professional development. Our unique, membership-based model supports artists at all levels: students, emerging artists, artists with disabilities, hobbyists and professionals. No portfolio review is required and every member is eligible to participate in two annual members’ shows resulting in wonderfully diverse, inclusive, salon style exhibitions.

<p>A bit about Pam and her jewelry below:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hi! I'm Pam. I am a former government worker who left the world of consistency and comfort to explore the world and take a chance on myself. I started creating jewelry two years ago and have expanded into raw materials and recycling of old pieces I find. I work with copper mainly, because I love the vibrant color and flexibility of the metal.</p>
<p>I create very small intricate items like roses and lilies, to larger items like pendant lights. I welcome the challenges that my clients give me and enjoy every time I have a new idea. I look forward to being a long-standing member of Curve Studios.</p>
<p>HTV Jewelry has been run out of:</p>
<p>A bedroom in Casper, Wyoming<br/>Cassandra's living room<br/>Patrick's extra bedroom<br/>Anil's extra bedroom<br/>A 1988 Ford E-250 named Hilda (Who took me to the Eclipse Festival in Casper, Wyoming as an artist and Sound Healer)</p>
<p><br/>and now, takes up about half of Pam and Ryan's apartment.</p>
<p>While it has been an amazing journey, the time has come to branch out.<br/>The Curve Studios in the River Arts District of Asheville, NC has an opening for a jewelry maker.<br/>I toured the space, met Angelique (FlyCoopStudios.com) and Cassie (CassieEryallsCeramics.com) and I LOVE THEM!

A bit about Pam and her jewelry below:
 
Hi! I'm Pam. I am a former government worker who left the world of consistency and comfort to explore the world and take a chance on myself. I started creating jewelry two years ago and have expanded into raw materials and recycling of old pieces I find. I work with copper mainly, because I love the vibrant color and flexibility of the metal.
I create very small intricate items like roses and lilies, to larger items like pendant lights. I welcome the challenges that my clients give me and enjoy every time I have a new idea. I look forward to being a long-standing member of Curve Studios.
HTV Jewelry has been run out of:
A bedroom in Casper, WyomingCassandra's living roomPatrick's extra bedroomAnil's extra bedroomA 1988 Ford E-250 named Hilda (Who took me to the Eclipse Festival in Casper, Wyoming as an artist and Sound Healer)
and now, takes up about half of Pam and Ryan's apartment.
While it has been an amazing journey, the time has come to branch out.The Curve Studios in the River Arts District of Asheville, NC has an opening for a jewelry maker.I toured the space, met Angelique (FlyCoopStudios.com) and Cassie (CassieEryallsCeramics.com) and I LOVE THEM! I think they like me.
Which is amazing, y'all!
I've been looking for a space to produce my new jewelry ideas and work without worry of noise or making a mess. I can do it all here.
All I need is some help.
 
The space will be the perfect spot to bring HTV Jewelry into full production mode. Once we get there, rent for the space will be a breeze. Until then, I'm gonna need your support.
By donating to my cause, you receive the amount you donate, plus a little extra, toward a beautiful custom piece of your choosing, made by yours truly.
Everything is made by hand from pure copper sheet metal or wire. No pre-fab stuff here.
Prices are going to go up once I get settled in the shop, so you'll want to make your order soon!
Another option, would be to purchase any of the wonderful items still up on my etsy page:

<h3>Le spectacle</h3>
<p><strong>Les personnages</strong></p>
<p>Prêtes à affronter n'importe quel malheur, n'importe quelle joie bouleversante, Babiole et Berlingot sont des êtres appartenant au présent déchaîné; des êtres sauvages. Babiole, enfant frétillante, éthérée et disjonctée, a de nombreuses manies. Son imaginaire est saturé d'oiseaux. Clowne blanche, Berlingot est l'amie imaginaire de Babiole. Mais elle se rebelle contre l'étroitesse de ce rôle. Babiole patauge dans la peur et laisse ratatiner son désir; Berlingot se croit au-dessus de tout. Le duo s'inspire des enfants punks et majestueux présents dans l’œuvre de Réjean Ducharme : ils habitent l'instant comme un gouffre et un absolu.</p>
<p><strong>Ce que ça raconte </strong></p>
<p>Les deux clownes habitent La Caboche comme une zone à défendre. Routine matinale en compagnie des oiseaux, rituel musical au piano et tours athlétiques de bolo rythment leur vie sobre et fantasque. Pourtant, comme l'écrit Boris Vian, «la vie est amère quand il n'y a pas de sucre au fond». Bien vite, Babiole étouffe. Une crise de panique viscérale lui rappelle que pour trouver la mer, il faut d'abord quitter son terrier. Obsédées par une question («Où es-tu, matière?»), les enfants-clownes vont alors s'aventurer vers le monde pour goûter un ré-enchantement.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>En coulisses : comment ça se bâtit</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>C'est une écriture poétique qui a propulsé le projet. La trame narrative, minimale, prend ancrage dans cinq poèmes-piliers.</li>
<li>Ce spectacle n'a rien à voir avec une suite de numéros. Notre pratique du clown relève du théâtre physique et se tient loin de l'univers circassien.</li>
<li>À la manière de Jacques Lecoq, on cherche à « retourner à la source des mots, à ce silence du dessous ». <i>Où es-tu, matière ?</i> exclut donc la parole directe : parce que le corps a énormément à dire, on se trouve libérées des mots.</li>
<li><p>Provoquer le rire, là n'est pas la mission que l'on se donne. On veut conjuguer esprit comique, esprit lunatique et action poétique.<br/><br/>Durée : 75 minutes<br/>Public : adulte (à partir de 10 ans)<br/><br/> </p></li>

</div></div>","Short Summary
The Zen Haus Artist Collective was founded in 2014 as a residence and collective for LGBT and ally artists in Albany, NY.  The goal is a large scale artist colony for 20 full time members in Green Mountain Forest region of Vermont.
In December 2014, we fully incorporated as a nonprofit organisation in the State of New York.  The immediate goal is to get full 501(c)3 charity status by the IRS.    What We Need 
Like every good bureaucrat situation, everything takes time, money, and complication.  One of these complications may stand in the way of us getting the 501(c)3 status that we need to thrive as an organisation. This is why there are lawyers.  
In mid-February 2015, we have an appointment with the law offices of Perlman & Perlman, a firm who specializes in working with nonprofits.  The meeting is to confirm that our paperwork is on the right track and to point out what needs to be done on our end to make sure that we are eligible for 501(c)3 status. (The status situation  is more complicated than most people care about, if you have questions, the board and I will be happy to answer them.)    The Impact
 By donating to our fund, you will be helping our young organisation pay the consultation fee for the meeting, pay for transportation cost for our treasurer Jessica DeWeese to join me in New York City at the meeting, and cover some of the out of pocket costs for application fees to the State of New York that have already been incurred.
Risks & Challenges

<h3>about the book</h3>
<p>Hi! We are Sean and Cole Fiscus, the creators of <i>Why Aren’t I Real?</i>, a book of poems and drawings. For years, we have been cooking up masterpieces under the same roof, but haven’t gotten the opportunity to craft a dual series. Now that we are trapped in our homes because of the pandemic, we can finally make our dream a reality. </p>
<p>What’s the book about, you ask? Great question. You’re kind of putting us on the spot, here, but we can wing it, we suppose. It’s about the side effects of changing your birthday and the benefits of eating spinach. It’s about the wisest man in the world and the least terrifying monster. It’s also about balloons. Mostly balloons. Does that answer your question?</p>
<h3>what's inside?</h3>
<p>20 poems. 20 drawings. Unless we get excited. </p>
<p>We will self-publish our book through 48 Hour Books Publishing. It will be a 6 by 9 inch paperback. An ebook will also be available.</p>
<h3>about the poet and the drawing guy</h3>
<p>Sean Fiscus is a 12th grade student at Mercersburg Academy, where he plays tenor saxophone in the Jazz Band and Concert Band, co-directs the Math and Science Center, and serves as a dormitory prefect. He was also the co-captain of the boys’ varsity soccer team and co-captain of the indoor track and field team, and he is attending Duke University next year. He is our poet. </p>
<p>Cole Fiscus (last name not a coincidence) is a 9th grader at Allegany High School. He runs cross-country, plays trumpet and guitar, and draws the universe.</p>
<p>Together, they are the dynamic duo. Imagine Batman and Robin, Scooby and Shaggy, and cheese and crackers all squished into one spectacular partnership and made a little bit better. These two are back again with their latest (and first) book, <i>Why Aren’t I Real?</i>. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>about the campaign</h3>
<p>We aren’t a typical crowdfunding campaign. This is our first book, and we thought Indiegogo would be a great platform for starting sales and gaining exposure. One of the benefits of this site is the perks system, which, in our case, lets you buy an ebook or a paperback copy on the same platform. </p>
<p>That being said, if we get loads of book purchases, we will plan on continuing our collaborative endeavor with additional books and maybe search for a publisher. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>other options to help us</h3>
<p>If you can’t contribute right now, there are other things you can do to support our work.</p>
<p>First, share this campaign on social media! We are told that Indiegogo has wonderful tools for sharing. </p>

<p>Hey there, I'm Megan, otherwise known as Wayfaring Seamstress. When times are normal and COVID-free, my friends and I are actors and costumers, putting on shows or attending cosplay conventions. But things these days are a little more complicated, and we're finding new ways to work together to express our love of the arts and the collaboration that goes with it. </p>
<p>Enter this project. I have photogenic actor and dancer friends, know a photographer and makeup artist, and we all love the magic of Disney. We needed something to do, and we decided to make magic.</p>
<p>And now, enter you. Making costumes for ten people, especially elaborate ones based on historical designs or fairy tale dreams, is not a cheap endeavor. While, as the seamstress, I'm attempting to do this as much as I can out of my own budgeting and resources, I'm finding that I NEED a little help. Your help. So here's the plan:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1613006997/v5slthtngmnlzvcgoqcu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p>For the past several months, I've been designing costumes based not only one the characters, but the people who will be wearing them. While not all the designs have been finalized, I'll be updating this page with them as I do. My facebook page and twitter are also a great source of information for day to day updates on the project, including candids, fabric swatches, silliness with the models, and more, and both can be found here:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/WayfaringSeamstress"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/WayfaringSeamstress</a></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://twitter.com/WayfaringSeams"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://twitter.com/WayfaringSeams</a></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Ariel and Eric</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1613009877/zrznxmxt0ofwqg4quy8s.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">For Prince Eric, I wanted to stay true to his action and adventure sailor persona, without completely loosing his original design. And his original design is... Well, let's just say open V-necks and cummborbunds aren't exactly fashion norms. But I searched through some reference images and found that the dress uniform of the French Foreign Legion actually wears cummborbunds. This inspiration is exactly what I needed. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">For Ariel, I went through a few trials, but I finally decided to redesign the dress she wears the briefest amount in the film, during her final transformation into a human. I wanted something that looked like rippling waves along the beach- like seafoam, almost like a play on the original fairy tale in which mermaids are doomed to turn into it, and also based on the lyrics from the Broadway musical-only song ""Her Voice"" referring to a girl ""who's like the glimmer of the sunlight on the sea""</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Phillip and Aurora</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1613010467/fgeifxorrdtzr1bbmwov.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">This inspiration for Aurora's gown came entirely from a lucky find in a fabric store- a beautiful piece of embroidered mesh covered in gold trimmed pink roses with lovely dark, dark teal blue leaves and vines. The combination of the two colors of her dress in one struck me, and I began planning in my head immediately.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">With Phillip, well, I've LOVED the recent redesigns the Disney Parks have done with the character, particularly in their Festival of Fantasy Parade in which he fights an actual, clockwork firebreathing dragon. It was simply a matter of comparing my favorite parts of each design and then matching the colors to fit Aurora.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Belle and the Beast</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1613010915/uy03jto4rse4c4pbqzmx.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Belle deserves a special spotlight for how much of an alteration it is. The <i>robe a la française </i>is one of my favorite historical dress styles, and thankfully, the lovely lady playing Belle agrees. I couldn't decide how to approach the color, because the big layers of yellow just... wasn't speaking to me. We found a similarly floral printed dress, and things just began to click from there. While Belle is elegant, she is also a more simplistic beauty than some of her other princess counterpoints, and this dress is meant to reflect that.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1613011842/zl8ddowm0omfcytqidts.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The Beast is still a work in progress, but I figured you might enjoy seeing him none-the-less. As much as I LOVE 18th century women's clothing, the men's clothes in that era... aren't my favorite. But I'm slowly piecing together something I can live with. This piece is definitely one of the more collaborative ones, requiring the skills of myself, and sculptor, and a makeup artist to fully realize. It's difficult, and also probably the one I'm most excited to see finished.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Rapunzel and Flynn Rider</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1613063989/dkki7znlgz2px56rlxlj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Rapunzel's costume is being designed by the lovely lady wearing her, Amy. She says that the bottom of the bodice is meant to invoke the sun design that is the symbol of the kingdom of Corona and plans on doing more of a long, traditionally fairy tale braid instead of the loose hair from the movie. You can find her on Instagram here for more of her work -<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/amyhotovchin/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.instagram.com/amyhotovchin/</a></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Of course, we all know that Flynn Rider is just an alias for Eugene Fitzherbert, and it's one of Eugene's outfits that I got the idea for this costume from. I was stuck for a while because let's face it, as far as designs for Disney men go, Flynn Rider is close to perfect, and changing or improving upon that felt like an impossible task. Thankfully, the Tangled Adventures animated series came to my rescue, and after borrow some design elements from one of his outfits there and tweaking the color scheme with help from Amy, we came up with this. You're all going to swoon when you see this boy smolder in this outfit, I guarantee it.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Aladdin and Jasmine</h3>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">While we don't have designs finalized for these two yet, I can give you some hints- my good friend Namitha is taking the lead, wanting to take her first hand knowledge of modern Indian fashion to create something truly unique for the two characters. She and I will be working together on Aladdin while she designs something for Jasmine which she'll be wearing herself. As someone with very little experience in that area, I'm super excited to learn more, and to create a look for two characters that isn't so heavily influenced by, well... white fashion designers, lol.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">UPDATE!!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We've been working hard, and gotten a design for Aladdin figured out. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615221154/zuzvtlokbkdibsfsvut2.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<p>For us, the biggest reward will be getting to pursue our craft and build pieces for our portfolios, without going bankrupt in the process. Things right now are... well, it's almost beyond words how bad they are for stage performers, costumers, crews, etc. especially those of us involved in small local and community theaters. We miss doing what we love, and this helps us do just a small bit of that, while also preparing for a future when we can hopefully join together as a community and collaborate again. For helping us with that, even with just a share or a single dollar donation, we are extremely grateful.</p>

<p>While our initial goal of $500 will help a lot with funding this project, meeting further goals will help us turn it into something that seems, well, out of a fairy tale dream. Here's what we can do with each met goal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initial goal $500 - 1/3 of the fabric costs will be covered</li>
<li>First stretch goal $750 - Further covers material costs, plus gives us room in the budget to splurge on some props</li>
<li>Second stretch goal $1000 - More than half the material costs, and even more props!</li>
<li>Third stretch goal $1500 - Fabric costs are completely covered!</li>
<li>Fourth stretch goal $2000 - Not only will material costs be covered and fun props and photoshoot additions added, but we will also be able to pay the participants a small stipend. Also, I will cry. Like, a lot. </li>

Thank you, truly.</p></div>","Hey there, I'm Megan, otherwise known as Wayfaring Seamstress. When times are normal and COVID-free, my friends and I are actors and costumers, putting on shows or attending cosplay conventions. But things these days are a little more complicated, and we're finding new ways to work together to express our love of the arts and the collaboration that goes with it. 
Enter this project. I have photogenic actor and dancer friends, know a photographer and makeup artist, and we all love the magic of Disney. We needed something to do, and we decided to make magic.
And now, enter you. Making costumes for ten people, especially elaborate ones based on historical designs or fairy tale dreams, is not a cheap endeavor. While, as the seamstress, I'm attempting to do this as much as I can out of my own budgeting and resources, I'm finding that I NEED a little help. Your help. So here's the plan:


For the past several months, I've been designing costumes based not only one the characters, but the people who will be wearing them. While not all the designs have been finalized, I'll be updating this page with them as I do. My facebook page and twitter are also a great source of information for day to day updates on the project, including candids, fabric swatches, silliness with the models, and more, and both can be found here:
https://www.facebook.com/WayfaringSeamstress
https://twitter.com/WayfaringSeams
 
Ariel and Eric

For Prince Eric, I wanted to stay true to his action and adventure sailor persona, without completely loosing his original design. And his original design is... Well, let's just say open V-necks and cummborbunds aren't exactly fashion norms. But I searched through some reference images and found that the dress uniform of the French Foreign Legion actually wears cummborbunds. This inspiration is exactly what I needed. 
For Ariel, I went through a few trials, but I finally decided to redesign the dress she wears the briefest amount in the film, during her final transformation into a human. I wanted something that looked like rippling waves along the beach- like seafoam, almost like a play on the original fairy tale in which mermaids are doomed to turn into it, and also based on the lyrics from the Broadway musical-only song ""Her Voice"" referring to a girl ""who's like the glimmer of the sunlight on the sea""
 
Phillip and Aurora

This inspiration for Aurora's gown came entirely from a lucky find in a fabric store- a beautiful piece of embroidered mesh covered in gold trimmed pink roses with lovely dark, dark teal blue leaves and vines. The combination of the two colors of her dress in one struck me, and I began planning in my head immediately.
With Phillip, well, I've LOVED the recent redesigns the Disney Parks have done with the character, particularly in their Festival of Fantasy Parade in which he fights an actual, clockwork firebreathing dragon. It was simply a matter of comparing my favorite parts of each design and then matching the colors to fit Aurora.
 
Belle and the Beast

Belle deserves a special spotlight for how much of an alteration it is. The robe a la française is one of my favorite historical dress styles, and thankfully, the lovely lady playing Belle agrees. I couldn't decide how to approach the color, because the big layers of yellow just... wasn't speaking to me. We found a similarly floral printed dress, and things just began to click from there. While Belle is elegant, she is also a more simplistic beauty than some of her other princess counterpoints, and this dress is meant to reflect that.

The Beast is still a work in progress, but I figured you might enjoy seeing him none-the-less. As much as I LOVE 18th century women's clothing, the men's clothes in that era... aren't my favorite. But I'm slowly piecing together something I can live with. This piece is definitely one of the more collaborative ones, requiring the skills of myself, and sculptor, and a makeup artist to fully realize. It's difficult, and also probably the one I'm most excited to see finished.
 
Rapunzel and Flynn Rider

 
Rapunzel's costume is being designed by the lovely lady wearing her, Amy. She says that the bottom of the bodice is meant to invoke the sun design that is the symbol of the kingdom of Corona and plans on doing more of a long, traditionally fairy tale braid instead of the loose hair from the movie. You can find her on Instagram here for more of her work -https://www.instagram.com/amyhotovchin/
Of course, we all know that Flynn Rider is just an alias for Eugene Fitzherbert, and it's one of Eugene's outfits that I got the idea for this costume from. I was stuck for a while because let's face it, as far as designs for Disney men go, Flynn Rider is close to perfect, and changing or improving upon that felt like an impossible task. Thankfully, the Tangled Adventures animated series came to my rescue, and after borrow some design elements from one of his outfits there and tweaking the color scheme with help from Amy, we came up with this. You're all going to swoon when you see this boy smolder in this outfit, I guarantee it.
 
Aladdin and Jasmine
 
While we don't have designs finalized for these two yet, I can give you some hints- my good friend Namitha is taking the lead, wanting to take her first hand knowledge of modern Indian fashion to create something truly unique for the two characters. She and I will be working together on Aladdin while she designs something for Jasmine which she'll be wearing herself. As someone with very little experience in that area, I'm super excited to learn more, and to create a look for two characters that isn't so heavily influenced by, well... white fashion designers, lol.  
UPDATE!!
We've been working hard, and gotten a design for Aladdin figured out. 

 
 


We want to reward you for helping us out! And while we don't have much, we do have a few little things that we think you'll love. So please check the side of this page for more information on the perks and rewards that we have for you. If Stretch Goals are made, more rewards might be added in the future. 
And no matter what you do to help us, whether it's spreading the word, just donating some spare change, or helping out with a big contribution, you're going to get to see an amazing final product. Our photographer, Firefly Photography, will be posting images free for all to see online on facebook and their website. 
https://www.facebook.com/fireflyphotoco
https://fireflyphotographyco.mypixieset.com/
 
Here are a couple examples of their previous work with these same actors and models:


 
For us, the biggest reward will be getting to pursue our craft and build pieces for our portfolios, without going bankrupt in the process. Things right now are... well, it's almost beyond words how bad they are for stage performers, costumers, crews, etc. especially those of us involved in small local and community theaters. We miss doing what we love, and this helps us do just a small bit of that, while also preparing for a future when we can hopefully join together as a community and collaborate again. For helping us with that, even with just a share or a single dollar donation, we are extremely grateful.
 


 
While our initial goal of $500 will help a lot with funding this project, meeting further goals will help us turn it into something that seems, well, out of a fairy tale dream. Here's what we can do with each met goal:

Initial goal $500 - 1/3 of the fabric costs will be covered
First stretch goal $750 - Further covers material costs, plus gives us room in the budget to splurge on some props
Second stretch goal $1000 - More than half the material costs, and even more props!
Third stretch goal $1500 - Fabric costs are completely covered!
Fourth stretch goal $2000 - Not only will material costs be covered and fun props and photoshoot additions added, but we will also be able to pay the participants a small stipend. Also, I will cry. Like, a lot.

<h3>Nails &amp; Beauty</h3>
<p><strong>THE FILM</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1617007561/cp1cdgplr5a4xohtx0lq.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p>Awkward teen Lucy escapes dull suburbia and archaic gender constraints when she’s thrown into the absurd world of the buff and brilliant builder Louisa at ‘Nails &amp; Beauty’. This is the alternative beauty salon where Louisa and her assistants perform unconventional beauty makeover treatments involving power tools, cement baths, and unique builders-tea ‘hot-stone’ therapies. Through a revelatory transformation à la Louisa, Lucy discovers a new mode of womanhood and a space where she belongs.</p>
<p>Nails &amp; Beauty seeks to subvert gender expression by playfully re-presenting the pop-culture makeover trope featured in ‘girly’ teen films such as Clueless, The Princess Diaries and Mean Girls.</p>
<p>The film script has been developed through BFI Network's Short Film development programme. We're extremely pleased to have secured part funding for this film's production, are now seeking the remainder for our scheduled 3-day shoot in Margate in May 2021.</p>

<p><strong>ABOUT MOI</strong></p>
<p>I'm a visual artist, a 2017 BA graduate of <strong>the Slade School of Fine Art</strong> and 2019<strong> Open School East </strong>alumnus. Since graduating I've focused on creating films because I love the creative collaboration that filmmaking is.  My absurd handmade props and costumes are the genesis from which my passion for filmmaking grew. In Nails &amp; Beauty, these strands of my practice converge with the work of admirable collaborators in an uplifting, comedic, experimental film that creatively explores themes of self-discovery and transformation.</p>

THE FILM

Awkward teen Lucy escapes dull suburbia and archaic gender constraints when she’s thrown into the absurd world of the buff and brilliant builder Louisa at ‘Nails & Beauty’. This is the alternative beauty salon where Louisa and her assistants perform unconventional beauty makeover treatments involving power tools, cement baths, and unique builders-tea ‘hot-stone’ therapies. Through a revelatory transformation à la Louisa, Lucy discovers a new mode of womanhood and a space where she belongs.
Nails & Beauty seeks to subvert gender expression by playfully re-presenting the pop-culture makeover trope featured in ‘girly’ teen films such as Clueless, The Princess Diaries and Mean Girls.
The film script has been developed through BFI Network's Short Film development programme. We're extremely pleased to have secured part funding for this film's production, are now seeking the remainder for our scheduled 3-day shoot in Margate in May 2021.
YOUR CONTRIBUTION
Your contribution will be used to pay cast, crew members and creative collaborators...(and maybe even..me? lololol just kidding!!) Outlandish costumes, absurd props and surreal sets are central to this films concept. Your support will go towards funding the creation of artwork for our film:


A bespoke hi-vis tuxedo suit and ball gown, created by our costume maker.
A bath filled with 'cement', created by our carpenter and set builder extraordinaire. This prop requires time, work and experimentation. The cement needs to churn, it needs to be opaque, and it needs to look chunky...could it be porridge? Only experimentation will tell.
Transforming local workshop 'Grandad's Workshop' into a magical, surreal space that sits somewhere in between carpentry workshop and beauty salon.


Your support means that we can deliver the highest quality film possible. Importantly, this will increase our chances of achieving film festival screenings, which will lead to future opportunities by enabling us to: 

Develop our profiles as artists.
Expand our networks by engaging with the communities that film festivals foster.
Build strong collaborative relationships, making future work opportunities possible.

PRINTS
I've made a wee range of colourful, thematic prints available to purchase / send to you as thank for your support <3 
 
ABOUT MOI
I'm a visual artist, a 2017 BA graduate of the Slade School of Fine Art and 2019 Open School East alumnus. Since graduating I've focused on creating films because I love the creative collaboration that filmmaking is.  My absurd handmade props and costumes are the genesis from which my passion for filmmaking grew. In Nails & Beauty, these strands of my practice converge with the work of admirable collaborators in an uplifting, comedic, experimental film that creatively explores themes of self-discovery and transformation.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Keyth Neso.  I am an artist, pianist, composer, music producer/engineer/mixer, hypnotherapist, Tarologist, and creative risk-taker.</p>
<p>After twenty years in the professional recording industry (working with clients such as Coldplay, Antony &amp; The Johnsons, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, etc...), I am getting back to my roots as a classical pianist, composer, and visual artist, while incorporating newfound passions into a cohesive multimedia buffet of all I have to offer artistically, as an homage to the courageous life of my beloved grandmother, Dorothy, who passed in 1999.</p>
<p><i><strong>A Soul Flies Home</strong> </i>is intended to be my post-metamorphosis re-emergence as an artist, as I compose separate pieces of original music grounded in acoustic piano, and then use the orchestral vignettes as inspiration to create original large scale paintings and silent films to accompany the music and live performance, all to be captured in high resolution video and audio.</p>
<p>This is a huge undertaking that will serve as the timely culmination of the many different chapters of my life, and offer to the world a gift in honor of my grandmother.  I was not able to understand nor relate to the numerous difficulties she faced while she was still living, and this is my expressive attempt to let her know how much I care, across and through the boundaries of space and time.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This is a big project, and there is much work to be done.  I am asking for $53,000 to cover the costs and expenses of space, lighting, musicians, rehearsals, hardware and software, printed materials, promotion, creative effort and high-resolution audio and video capture, as well as live webcast.</p>
<p>Your donation can buy you a seat to the intimate and unique multimedia performance with world-class musicians, access to a private link for a live webcast, a professionally edited video of the performance, access to the making-of mini-documentary, large scale autographed prints of the original artworks, private links to the original films, original portraits of whomever you choose, original compositions and films to accompany them created just for you as an expression of gratitude for your support, dinner and conversation with me, the artist, or a handmade deck of Ancient Marseille Tarot cards.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I hope the world premiere of this challenging and heartfelt multimedia experience will ripple out into the field far and wide, inspiring others to take big chances and dedicate themselves to their passions.  I hope to continue to perform this work after its premiere, and would be thrilled to have the experience live in the hearts of those it touched for years to come.</p>
<p>And I also hope Dorothy (AKA ""Granny"") witnesses the event from behind the veil as we celebrate the impact she had on my life with beautiful music and imagery.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I have experience putting together large scale experiences, and there are always snags.  They will happen, and will be opportunities to grow and learn lessons.  With your support, I am certain I can deliver an experience that will not be forgotten, and it will live on in my heart forever.</p>

WOZA!
is an open art experience where we use youth-centered, participatory methods to
engage youth in the art and practice of storytelling through visual
media. </p>
<p><b>WOZA! will being going to South Africa to work directly with a team of youth in rural KwaZulu-Natal to develop, produce and share their stories - locally and worldwide. </b></p> <ul> <li>1. TELL YOUR STORY </li> <li>2. MAKE YOUR STORY</li> <li>3. SHARE YOUR STORY</li> </ul> <p>Our goal is empower youth with the knowledge, skills and experience to produce their stories into works of art and share them with their communities and the world to create awareness and encourage resources into the community to create a youth-centred visual arts program.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <ul> <li>We are raising $10,000.  This will cover project costs including: stipends for project partners and staff who will facilitate linkages within the community, interviewers, translators, transportation and fuel, food for participants, sound recording, and costs for a community event where youth will share their work.</li> <li>After all the projects are created and shared within the community we will return first to Canada and hold an Art Gallery Event to exhibit the work, with hopes to raise awareness and funds to continue this work. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Our youth-centered, participatory approach to creating visual media is designed to promote confidence, awareness and capacity to advocate for positive change. </p>
<p>The first participants in WOZA! are youth born just after 1994 -- the first generation of children born after the end of apartheid. Although 'born free', the majority of South African youth are growing up in extremely challenging circumstances due to the intertwined effects of unemployment and poverty, including high levels of food insecurity, HIV and TB, unplanned pregnancies, and violence. Further, many youth are growing up without their parents as a result of HIV/AIDS -- over half of all orphans under 18 years old are adolescents 12 to 17 years old. </p>
<p>WOZA! will give youth the opportunity to voice their experiences, needs, and dreams through visual media. Further, they will gain new skills and experience in the various aspects of media production, guided by a team from Canada, the US, South Africa and Zimbabwe including members with expertise in film, photography, storytelling, adolescent health, participatory design methods and community development. WOZA! will ensure that the stories and images produced with and by the youth are shared locally -- in their own community -- as well as internationally. </p>

WOZA!
is an open art experience where we use youth-centered, participatory methods to
engage youth in the art and practice of storytelling through visual
media. 
WOZA! will being going to South Africa to work directly with a team of youth in rural KwaZulu-Natal to develop, produce and share their stories - locally and worldwide.   1. TELL YOUR STORY  2. MAKE YOUR STORY 3. SHARE YOUR STORY  Our goal is empower youth with the knowledge, skills and experience to produce their stories into works of art and share them with their communities and the world to create awareness and encourage resources into the community to create a youth-centred visual arts program.  

What We Need & What You Get  We are raising $10,000.  This will cover project costs including: stipends for project partners and staff who will facilitate linkages within the community, interviewers, translators, transportation and fuel, food for participants, sound recording, and costs for a community event where youth will share their work. After all the projects are created and shared within the community we will return first to Canada and hold an Art Gallery Event to exhibit the work, with hopes to raise awareness and funds to continue this work. 


The Impact Our youth-centered, participatory approach to creating visual media is designed to promote confidence, awareness and capacity to advocate for positive change. 
The first participants in WOZA! are youth born just after 1994 -- the first generation of children born after the end of apartheid. Although 'born free', the majority of South African youth are growing up in extremely challenging circumstances due to the intertwined effects of unemployment and poverty, including high levels of food insecurity, HIV and TB, unplanned pregnancies, and violence. Further, many youth are growing up without their parents as a result of HIV/AIDS -- over half of all orphans under 18 years old are adolescents 12 to 17 years old. 
WOZA! will give youth the opportunity to voice their experiences, needs, and dreams through visual media. Further, they will gain new skills and experience in the various aspects of media production, guided by a team from Canada, the US, South Africa and Zimbabwe including members with expertise in film, photography, storytelling, adolescent health, participatory design methods and community development. WOZA! will ensure that the stories and images produced with and by the youth are shared locally -- in their own community -- as well as internationally.

</div><p></p><p><i></i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p><i>Last
Christmas, I gave you fine art, </i></p>
<p><i>But the
very next day, you gave it away. </i></p>
<p><i>This
year, to save me from tears, </i></p>
<p><i>I’m
giving you something conceptual. </i></p>
<p><b>This
Christmas Home Live Art and Richard DeDomenici are putting the fun back into
festive fundraising.</b></p>
<p></p>
<h3><b><br/></b></h3><h3><b>Who we are and what we're
doing</b></h3>
<p>Home Live Art is a UK
based arts organisation who produces live art events in the public realm. From
festivals, large-scale outdoor events to curating work in domestic houses, Home
Live Art has collaborated with an array of independent artists since 1999. One
such artist is film maker and self styled raconteur Richard DeDomenici.</p>
<p>In summer 2015, Richard
decided it was time to make a record but a record with a difference!
Entitled <b><i>Live Art Aid</i></b>, Richard’s record would be a charity
single released in time for Christmas!</p>
<p><b><i>
</i></b></p><p></p><p>Richard invited 20 artists to the famous Major Tom music studios in
London to record <b><i>Live Art Aid</i></b>, a song co-written with artists Bryony Kimmings and Tom Parkinson which is designed to raise money for, and awareness of, live artists in the UK. <span>We’re now selling the record as a
download or limited edition vinyl.</span></p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span>
<p>Purposefully tongue in
check but with a serious message, <b><i>Live Art Aid</i></b> aims
to explain what live art is to the tune of <i>Do They Know
It’s Christmas</i> played backwards and all within 4 minutes!<br/></p>
<p>There is a fundraising
target of £4,000 and all money raised will be re-distributed between the 20
artists who contributed to the record .</p>
<p>It's a cause Richard
feels strongly about, with the creator noting, <i>“Live Art is one of the
most uncommercial art genres in the world, and is in danger of becoming
extinct. We’re like pandas in that respect - barely able to sustain ourselves,
and hardly ever having sex. Except most people have heard of pandas” </i> </p>
<p></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><h3><b>The Serious Bit - Why
support Live Art Aid?</b></h3>
<p>The
fact is, with ever tightening budgets and shrinking resources, it’s becoming increasingly difficult for independent, self -employed artists to
sustain themselves -so the idea behind <b><i>Live Art Aid</i></b> is
very simple; help us raise a small amount of money to provide an artist with
cash support to spark a new idea.</p>
<p>Of course, £200 can’t
make a finished work – but this modest amount can help seed an idea, test a
hunch or pilot an experiment. And these ideas could become projects which you end up
seeing.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><h3><b>What we need and how you
can help us</b></h3>
<p>We want to raise £4000 in 40 days.</p>
<p>This means the 20
participating artists will each receive £200. That's nothing we hear you say! But don't underestimate what £200 could do -  it could pay for
rehearsal space for a weekend, pay for 2 long-distance train journeys enabling
an artist to meet with venues and curators, it could even cover the airfare to
a European Festival enabling an artist to present their work.</p>
<p>DeDomenici - described by
many as a scruffy Bob Geldof but more annoying and less talented - says the
record is a last ditch attempt to radically improve the deteriorating funding
landscape for live artists. </p>
<p><b><i></i>
</b></p><p><i>“If this doesn’t work I’m planning
to open a Live Art speakeasy” </i>he threatens. </p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><h3><b>What you get in return</b></h3>
<p><i><b></b></i></p><p><b><i>Live Art Aid </i></b>features a host of
great perks to thank you for your support. From personal thanks and kisses to a
signed, limited edition vinyl record. Each 7-inch vinyl will be
hand-numbered by Richard, with his left hand, and features an exclusive b-side
featuring Richard and one Live Art Aid co-writer Bryony Kimmings.  <span>Because it takes a while to press
vinyl, the record will be available in January 2016 - a great way to start the
new year with a cheery song!</span></p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span>
<p>The song is
available from December the 1st in a digital download format<br/></p>
<p>We have 300
limited edition, hand-numbered 7-inch vinyl records on offer (for those without
a record player, each vinyl copy comes with a handy hole in the middle for

Christmas, I gave you fine art, 
But the
very next day, you gave it away. 
This
year, to save me from tears, 
I’m
giving you something conceptual. 
This
Christmas Home Live Art and Richard DeDomenici are putting the fun back into
festive fundraising.

Who we are and what we're
doing
Home Live Art is a UK
based arts organisation who produces live art events in the public realm. From
festivals, large-scale outdoor events to curating work in domestic houses, Home
Live Art has collaborated with an array of independent artists since 1999. One
such artist is film maker and self styled raconteur Richard DeDomenici.
In summer 2015, Richard
decided it was time to make a record but a record with a difference!
Entitled Live Art Aid, Richard’s record would be a charity
single released in time for Christmas!

Richard invited 20 artists to the famous Major Tom music studios in
London to record Live Art Aid, a song co-written with artists Bryony Kimmings and Tom Parkinson which is designed to raise money for, and awareness of, live artists in the UK. We’re now selling the record as a
download or limited edition vinyl.
Purposefully tongue in
check but with a serious message, Live Art Aid aims
to explain what live art is to the tune of Do They Know
It’s Christmas played backwards and all within 4 minutes!
There is a fundraising
target of £4,000 and all money raised will be re-distributed between the 20
artists who contributed to the record .
It's a cause Richard
feels strongly about, with the creator noting, “Live Art is one of the
most uncommercial art genres in the world, and is in danger of becoming
extinct. We’re like pandas in that respect - barely able to sustain ourselves,
and hardly ever having sex. Except most people have heard of pandas”  

The Serious Bit - Why
support Live Art Aid?
The
fact is, with ever tightening budgets and shrinking resources, it’s becoming increasingly difficult for independent, self -employed artists to
sustain themselves -so the idea behind Live Art Aid is
very simple; help us raise a small amount of money to provide an artist with
cash support to spark a new idea.
Of course, £200 can’t
make a finished work – but this modest amount can help seed an idea, test a
hunch or pilot an experiment. And these ideas could become projects which you end up
seeing.

What we need and how you
can help us
We want to raise £4000 in 40 days.
This means the 20
participating artists will each receive £200. That's nothing we hear you say! But don't underestimate what £200 could do -  it could pay for
rehearsal space for a weekend, pay for 2 long-distance train journeys enabling
an artist to meet with venues and curators, it could even cover the airfare to
a European Festival enabling an artist to present their work.
DeDomenici - described by
many as a scruffy Bob Geldof but more annoying and less talented - says the
record is a last ditch attempt to radically improve the deteriorating funding
landscape for live artists. 

“If this doesn’t work I’m planning
to open a Live Art speakeasy” he threatens. 
What you get in return
Live Art Aid features a host of
great perks to thank you for your support. From personal thanks and kisses to a
signed, limited edition vinyl record. Each 7-inch vinyl will be
hand-numbered by Richard, with his left hand, and features an exclusive b-side
featuring Richard and one Live Art Aid co-writer Bryony Kimmings.  Because it takes a while to press
vinyl, the record will be available in January 2016 - a great way to start the
new year with a cheery song!
The song is
available from December the 1st in a digital download format
We have 300
limited edition, hand-numbered 7-inch vinyl records on offer (for those without
a record player, each vinyl copy comes with a handy hole in the middle for
affixing to the wall with a hammer). Each vinyl comes with specially designed sleeve and is hand-numbered by Richard using his left hand.
If you don't have a
permanent address, or live in rented accommodation where you aren’t allowed to
make holes in your walls, various bits of associated merchandise, such as mugs, t-shirts and personal thanks are also available.

<h1>Poetry In The Heart of Jamestown</h1>
<p>It is amazing what experiences await you on a seemingly random weeknight, in a small, dusty corner of Western, NY. Yet, when you begin to wander the brick alley-ways of downtown Jamestown, it is nearly impossible to deny the subtle scent of possibility drifting around the crumbling corners of these resolute landmarks. There is a feeling that this city is equal parts inescapable decay and incredible progress; a sense of wonder that brings you back into the heart of Jamestown again and again. There are things to be discovered at every turn. Atmospheric and alluring local artists hiding in the shadows, hoping to break the steel and empty silence of an ordinary day. It was only in recent years that the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pulsepoetryslam/?pnref=lhc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pulse Poetry Slam</a> was born to bring these artists together. <b>Pulse Poetry events have grown to feature live acoustic music and comedy, and at the core of these events, provide Jamestown with it's only monthly poetry slam event, which combines the excitement of a contest with the emotional, intelligent, and creatively driven performances of some of the finest poets in this area.</b> Since 2014, Pulse has hosted nearly 30 events at 7 different local venues. </p>

</div></div>","Poetry In The Heart of Jamestown
It is amazing what experiences await you on a seemingly random weeknight, in a small, dusty corner of Western, NY. Yet, when you begin to wander the brick alley-ways of downtown Jamestown, it is nearly impossible to deny the subtle scent of possibility drifting around the crumbling corners of these resolute landmarks. There is a feeling that this city is equal parts inescapable decay and incredible progress; a sense of wonder that brings you back into the heart of Jamestown again and again. There are things to be discovered at every turn. Atmospheric and alluring local artists hiding in the shadows, hoping to break the steel and empty silence of an ordinary day. It was only in recent years that the Pulse Poetry Slam was born to bring these artists together. Pulse Poetry events have grown to feature live acoustic music and comedy, and at the core of these events, provide Jamestown with it's only monthly poetry slam event, which combines the excitement of a contest with the emotional, intelligent, and creatively driven performances of some of the finest poets in this area. Since 2014, Pulse has hosted nearly 30 events at 7 different local venues. 

 
Infinity

Phoenix Rising

                                
 Jones Valhalla
(Infinity hosts a Pulse Poetry event on the 1st Thursday of every month. Phoenix Rising is home to Fire Nights, a music and poetry slam series by Pulse that falls on the 3rd Monday of every month. Previous venues also include SUNY JCC, Havana, Chautauqua Music, and the James Prendergast Library.)

Each event is unique in it's growing ability to draw people of all ages and backgrounds into the community, and oftentimes, onto the stage. A constant and forever crucial aspect of the Pulse Poetry Slam is the core body of poets who have supported this endeavor since the beginning.

   

So much of the growth that Pulse has achieved has been the result of the ceaseless love and support of members of this community, just like you.


  
  



#ThisIsYourPulse: Giving Back
 This campaign has been launched in the hopes that Pulse will be able to give back to everyone in the end. With this support, we will be able to accomplish many things, such as: 
Fund a platform for which Pulse will be able to spotlight these poets and artists, in an effort to reward them for their earnestness & showcase their thriving talents. Pay them for their performances at such a showcase. Performance poetry is an art form, and these artists are worthy of backing for every one of their endeavors. Provide Jamestown with more incomparable events, and further contribute to the growth of the arts community in this area. 
We look forward to showing our appreciation to each and every individual that makes a contribution to this endeavor! There are great perks available to you, even if you only donate $1. Throughout the course of this campaign, we will be giving away some Pulse goodies like: vouchers for free access into our events, custom t-shirts, buttons, vinyl stickers, coffee mugs, & more! Many thanks to our friends at Tru Media Solutions for providing quality, local craftsmanship and products to Pulse.

   
       
Even if we do not reach our entire goal, we will continue to sustain an exciting experience for our artists and our community. Whatever funds we raise will contribute to the growth and bettering of our event series.

The Impact
 Contributing to this campaign will change the game for the poets, artists, and members of this community that have experienced first-hand the incredible energy, encouragement, acceptance, and love that Pulse has thrived on since the very beginning. See for yourself what impact has already been made, and how supporting Pulse could bring this movement to entirely new heights:

""I had gone to two Pulse Poetry open mics before competing in my first slam. Everyone was so kind and supportive, and the room was full of talented performers. Autumn most certainly made me feel welcome and appreciated as soon as I stepped in. The overwhelming support and love from the audience and fellow performers was heartwarming each time I've competed. Pulse is a loving community of talented people and I'm so glad to be a part of it!"" - Kassandra Kum, two time Pulse Poetry Slam champion, pictured below performing at the JCC Interweave/Pulse Poetry Slam collaboration event.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>We are building a large-scale, interactive art project that combines a triple spiral labyrinth with the transformative aspects of shamanic initiation. The three core members of the team are 'Natara, Angie, and Celina. We come from diverse backgrounds, and together we bring a strong background in neo-shamanism, teaching, large-scale art, project management, and personal transformation.</p>
<p>The project creates positive, powerful, personal change for everyone who has gotten involved. Our society lacks opportunities for visceral mystical experiences that don't require drugs or years of study, and we don't always remember to celebrate our transformational experiences. We also have found that the local communities and schools don't have a lot of contact with interactive art, so this will fill a real and present need. <br/></p>
<p>The project will be open to the public and self-guided. The opportunity to use it as a resource for workshops, of course, exists, but we wanted to create something that people could access when they need to and when they want to. When people process their experience in the after-care area, whether through art or words, they will be adding to the richness of the project, and others will benefit from those who came before them.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We are looking for <b>funding</b> and <b>physical assistance</b>, as well as <b>in-kind 
donations</b>. The money will cover the build and upkeep for several years, 
at which point we foresee if being self-supporting. We plan on doing the
 initial, foundational build over the second weekend in January, and we 
invite as many people as would like to come down, help out, and 
experience the magic of the site. In keeping with the recycling ethos of 
East Jesus, in-kind donation requests include old plastic grocery bags, 
unwearable clothing items, and old wind chimes and mobiles. <br/></p>
<p>We estimate needing about $5000, which will cover cement, poles, poultry fencing, wire, the pyramid, a cover and supplies for the after-care/decompression/processing space, solar lights, stones for the grid, rental or purchase of any tools we can't borrow, and ongoing upkeep for the next few years. All labor is donated, and we are borrowing as many of the tools as we can, and upcycling/recycling/repurposing materials wherever possible. If we do not reach our goal, all of the collected money will still go into the project, it will just take us longer to get things done.<br/></p>For people who come and help us build in January, we will be facilitating an interfaith new 
moon ritual on Saturday night, where people can set their intentions for 2016. We invite everyone to bring a symbol of empowerment for the altar, as the energies will be conducive to fostering personal empowerment, self realization, and strong forward motion. <br/><br/>Donors will have the opportunity to participate in one of our future on-site workshops and will have their names listed as donors on our website. Other perks include a limited edition collectors' item merit badge, a digital copy of our gluten-free cooking for the holidays cookbook, and a finger labyrinth.<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Who We Are<br/>
</h3> <p>'Natara has been teaching meditation and transformational workshops for over 20 years, and put together a team to build a smaller labyrinth as a one day project earlier in 2015.</p>
<p>Celina is a professional chef, specializing in eating restrictions, and has a background in project management with one of the largest entertainment companies in the world.</p>
<p>Angie works in health care and has been on her own intense shamanic path for several years.</p>
<p>Other people coming together to help bring this project to reality include business owners, artists, students, and teachers from all walks of life and all spiritual paths.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>One of our biggest challenges in this El Nino year is going to be weather. It's hard to lay and cure concrete when it's actively raining. It's always a good idea to be flexible with your timing when working in partnership with Mother Nature, and we are aware that the project may run long because of this. Luckily, we don't think it's going to increase our costs in any significant way.<br/><br/>We are planning our construction with the elements and climate in mind, and the final product should require only minimal upkeep, mostly replenishing art supplies and occasionally replacing construction materials. <br/><br/>Vandalism is a concern, but the installation is in full view of the residential section of East Jesus, so we probably won't be terribly vulnerable. Everything we're using should be easily replaceable and no terribly valuable to thieves.<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>Can't donate money right now? You can still help us out.<br/><br/>(1) Come help us build! If you can't make it the second weekend in January, but still want to help in the future, drop a note to labyrinth@ayamanatara.com and we'll keep you apprised of future work weekends.<br/><br/>(2) Have a collection of plastic grocery bags you haven't recycled yet? We would love them! The walls and ceiling of the tunnels will be made from various materials woven through poultry fencing, and plastic bags are great for that. Old clothes that can't go to charity are also great for the tunnel construction, as long as they haven't come into contact with animal waste. Likewise for ribbons, mylar, weird fabric you don't know what to do with, and anything else that can be woven through poultry fencing.<br/><br/>(3) We are looking to have a lot of wind chimes, and wood or shell mobiles that make noise in the breeze, to create a soundscape. We are also collecting bottles for a wind-powered sound sculpture that will go in one corner of the site, so any interesting and sturdy bottles will also be appreciated. Any of those that we don't use can still be used in the bottle wall on the far side of East Jesus.<br/><br/>(4) If you are part of a foundation that makes charitable contributions, 
especially to art, community-building projects, or spiritual causes, 
East Jesus is a 501C3. <br/><br/>And, of course...<br/>(5) Get the word out! Please share this campaign, talk about it, write about it, post about it... Let everyone know. <br/>

All labor is donated, and we are borrowing as many of the tools as we can, and upcycling/recycling/repurposing materials wherever possible. If we do not reach our goal, all of the collected money will still go into the project, it will just take us longer to get things done.For people who come and help us build in January, we will be facilitating an interfaith new 
moon ritual on Saturday night, where people can set their intentions for 2016. We invite everyone to bring a symbol of empowerment for the altar, as the energies will be conducive to fostering personal empowerment, self realization, and strong forward motion. Donors will have the opportunity to participate in one of our future on-site workshops and will have their names listed as donors on our website. Other perks include a limited edition collectors' item merit badge, a digital copy of our gluten-free cooking for the holidays cookbook, and a finger labyrinth.
  Who We Are
 'Natara has been teaching meditation and transformational workshops for over 20 years, and put together a team to build a smaller labyrinth as a one day project earlier in 2015.
Celina is a professional chef, specializing in eating restrictions, and has a background in project management with one of the largest entertainment companies in the world.
Angie works in health care and has been on her own intense shamanic path for several years.
Other people coming together to help bring this project to reality include business owners, artists, students, and teachers from all walks of life and all spiritual paths.

  Risks & ChallengesOne of our biggest challenges in this El Nino year is going to be weather. It's hard to lay and cure concrete when it's actively raining. It's always a good idea to be flexible with your timing when working in partnership with Mother Nature, and we are aware that the project may run long because of this. Luckily, we don't think it's going to increase our costs in any significant way.We are planning our construction with the elements and climate in mind, and the final product should require only minimal upkeep, mostly replenishing art supplies and occasionally replacing construction materials. Vandalism is a concern, but the installation is in full view of the residential section of East Jesus, so we probably won't be terribly vulnerable. Everything we're using should be easily replaceable and no terribly valuable to thieves.
  Other Ways You Can HelpCan't donate money right now? You can still help us out.(1) Come help us build! If you can't make it the second weekend in January, but still want to help in the future, drop a note to labyrinth@ayamanatara.com and we'll keep you apprised of future work weekends.(2) Have a collection of plastic grocery bags you haven't recycled yet? We would love them! The walls and ceiling of the tunnels will be made from various materials woven through poultry fencing, and plastic bags are great for that. Old clothes that can't go to charity are also great for the tunnel construction, as long as they haven't come into contact with animal waste. Likewise for ribbons, mylar, weird fabric you don't know what to do with, and anything else that can be woven through poultry fencing.(3) We are looking to have a lot of wind chimes, and wood or shell mobiles that make noise in the breeze, to create a soundscape. We are also collecting bottles for a wind-powered sound sculpture that will go in one corner of the site, so any interesting and sturdy bottles will also be appreciated. Any of those that we don't use can still be used in the bottle wall on the far side of East Jesus.(4) If you are part of a foundation that makes charitable contributions, 
especially to art, community-building projects, or spiritual causes, 
East Jesus is a 501C3. And, of course...(5) Get the word out! Please share this campaign, talk about it, write about it, post about it... Let everyone know.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div><p><b>Finnish Tech, Design &amp; Art (FTDA) Expo in NY May 18th and 19th</b></p>
<p><i>Help us showcase the best of Finnish
creativity, sustainability and innovation (‘finnovation’) to an American
audience.</i></p>
<p><b>Why</b></p>
<p>When
Laura and Mintie met a short while ago, we found besides our love for wine, we
had a shared passion for Finnish creativity. More specifically, we were both in
love with all the great innovation we saw here and frustrated by Finland’s
inability to translate that into the global market place. So we decided to
combine our thirty-five years of experience in global marketing, media, tech
and design to help Finnish creativity finally get the international platform it
deserves. </p>
<p><b>What</b></p>
<p>Finnish
Tech, Design and Art (FTDA) is a non-profit organization that promotes
outstanding Finnish creativity to the American market. Our annual event, the
Finnish Tech, Design and Art Expo showcases Finnish creativity, sustainability
and innovation to an exclusive NY audience of key decision makers, investors
and top tier media. Past events have attracted upwards of 800 attendees with a 400 person waiting list. Media exposure has included Time Magazine, Vogue (US)
and Elle (US) as well as numerous international online, print and TV outlets.</p>
<p><b>Where </b></p>
<p><i>Finnish people are insanely
innovative and intelligent. So are New Yorkers. </i></p>
<p>FTDA
brings Finland to Manhattan with a multi-content exhibition, cocktail gala and a Nordic music night designed to showcase Finnish creativity to an elite audience that includes
leaders in tech, design and art as well as investors and media. FTDA Expo capitalizes
on the overlap days of NY Design Week and NY Internet Week with its combined
70,000 person audience and international press from 30 + countries. The success
of our last two NYC events has led us to extend the 2015 Expo to two days—May
18th &amp; 19th.  </p>
<p><b>How</b></p>
<p>We’ve
received generous resources from our many partners. However, right now, FTDA is
a passion project that Laura and Mintie are funding out of their own pockets.
The past two events have been enormous successes where people were exposed to
the awesomeness of Finnish design while having a great time with music, food,
art and cocktails. So we’re kindly asking you to dig into your wallets and help
us make this happen. Any and all contributions are very welcome. Kiitos! </p>
<p><b>Who</b></p>
<p> We’re discovering the best in Finnish
designers, artists, techies, gamers, musicians and animators to showcase at FTDA Expo.

</div>
<div>Hi!  I'm<b> Christopher Butler, illustrator and concept artist</b> <a href=""http://www.chrisbutlerart.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">(www.chrisbutlerart.com)</a>, and for the past several years, I've had the luck of working on a whole bunch of great projects for lots of great people: science fiction and fantasy illustration for publication, concept art for some film and television, a bit of comic book work, and more.  I have a day job with a great company, and at night I come home and keep going...working on more illustration and design.  My favorite part of what I do is that, whether I'm working on my own projects or someone else's, the goal is the same:  <b>I work for that moment when art blows people's minds...if only for a moment. </b>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Recently...I ran into a series of problems, which might now turn into an opportunity to take my art to the next level and give people more than I have before.  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>It started when my Wacom digital tablet broke.  After my computer and my hands, this is the key device that lets me create art.</b></div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div>This was pretty unfortunate..and normally would just be an inconvenience until I ordered myself a new tablet.  <b>However, recent circumstances have made dropping several hundred dollars on a new tablet very difficult. </b> ( I don't want to dwell on the financial issues.  Suffice it to say I had a medical issue that, while thankfully turned out to be not too serious, has depleted my available ""art"" budget quite a bit.  I'm not going to miss any meals...but its definitely impacted spending for a while.) </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>But now, I think this could be an opportunity to upgrade my resources and a chance start doing some very cool things:<b>  First, I need a new Wacom digital tablet that will let me work.</b>
</div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div>
<b></b><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1188437/files/20150201122858-Earthship1.jpg?1422822538"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
</div>
<div><b><br/></b></div> </div> <div> <h3>Wacom Tablets are Magic.</h3> <p>A Wacom Digital Tablet is basically a magical slab of plastic that artists use with a magical pen to draw things on a computer in much the same way we draw on regular paper with a pencil.  (Okay...its probably not actual magic, but it sure feels like it.)  This device is the core of how I work.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>  There is a whole range of Wacom tablets available, but <b>the least pricey/smallest tablet that would allow me to continue on unfettered is the Wacom Intuos Pro Large, which runs about $499 USD</b>.  This is the lowest-tier Wacom tablet that would let me keep working uninterrupted.   </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>At the upper end of the Wacom Tablet spectrum is the Cintique 24 HD at about $2200 USD.  This would be a life-changing upgrade for an artist like myself.</b>  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>So if we manage to hit the goal of $550, fantastic!  Wacom Tablet Achieved!  Beyond that, everything will go toward improving my home studio.  And if we should actually stretch that goal all the way up above $2000...we're getting into Wacom Cintique territory, and that means even faster, better, and more interesting art.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>

</div></div>","Artists Use Tools to Blow People's Minds.






Hi!  I'm Christopher Butler, illustrator and concept artist (www.chrisbutlerart.com), and for the past several years, I've had the luck of working on a whole bunch of great projects for lots of great people: science fiction and fantasy illustration for publication, concept art for some film and television, a bit of comic book work, and more.  I have a day job with a great company, and at night I come home and keep going...working on more illustration and design.  My favorite part of what I do is that, whether I'm working on my own projects or someone else's, the goal is the same:  I work for that moment when art blows people's minds...if only for a moment. 


Recently...I ran into a series of problems, which might now turn into an opportunity to take my art to the next level and give people more than I have before.  

It started when my Wacom digital tablet broke.  After my computer and my hands, this is the key device that lets me create art.

This was pretty unfortunate..and normally would just be an inconvenience until I ordered myself a new tablet.  However, recent circumstances have made dropping several hundred dollars on a new tablet very difficult.  ( I don't want to dwell on the financial issues.  Suffice it to say I had a medical issue that, while thankfully turned out to be not too serious, has depleted my available ""art"" budget quite a bit.  I'm not going to miss any meals...but its definitely impacted spending for a while.) 

But now, I think this could be an opportunity to upgrade my resources and a chance start doing some very cool things:  First, I need a new Wacom digital tablet that will let me work.






   Wacom Tablets are Magic. A Wacom Digital Tablet is basically a magical slab of plastic that artists use with a magical pen to draw things on a computer in much the same way we draw on regular paper with a pencil.  (Okay...its probably not actual magic, but it sure feels like it.)  This device is the core of how I work.  

  There is a whole range of Wacom tablets available, but the least pricey/smallest tablet that would allow me to continue on unfettered is the Wacom Intuos Pro Large, which runs about $499 USD.  This is the lowest-tier Wacom tablet that would let me keep working uninterrupted.   

At the upper end of the Wacom Tablet spectrum is the Cintique 24 HD at about $2200 USD.  This would be a life-changing upgrade for an artist like myself.  

So if we manage to hit the goal of $550, fantastic!  Wacom Tablet Achieved!  Beyond that, everything will go toward improving my home studio.  And if we should actually stretch that goal all the way up above $2000...we're getting into Wacom Cintique territory, and that means even faster, better, and more interesting art.

    Perks! Perks! Perks!




Honestly...this is going to be the fun part for me.  Because if people are interested in the perks, that means they're interested in my art, and that makes me really, really happy.

Contributors of $1 or more get a huge public thank you.

Contributors of $25 get a very special sticky-note sketch mailed to them.  (Yes, really...trust me, you'll like it.


Contributors of $50 can claim a digital portrait of themselves perfect for profile images on Twitter, Facebook, or wherever you want.


$200 bucks will get a deluxe, high resolution digital illustration.

 Thanks a bunch!  :)",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>""It's an artist's job to show people the world they live in.  We hold up mirrors."" -- Neil Gaiman</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Julie, and I love to make art!  I am a classically-trained actor, adjunct college professor, and painter.  </p>
<p>As an artist and an educator, I decided long ago that I have two big responsibilities: to share art as a means of therapy for those in need, and to educate myself and others about our diverse world.  </p>
<p>One of the ways I have always intended to accomplish these goals is by participating in an artist residency abroad; studying the culture, creating art inspired by that culture, connecting with local artists as a means of cultural exchange, and then coming home and sharing what I learned.</p>
<p>On my recent winter break, I discovered a residency that will allow me to do all of the above.  The company is called the Arquetopia Foundation, and is located in Puebla, Mexico.  Arquetopia focuses on promoting artistic development through educational programs, with an emphasis on cultural exchange.  They have won awards for providing classical music training for the underserved youth of Puebla, and to learn more about their efforts, you may visit their website here: <a href=""http://www.archetopia.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.archetopia.org</a>.</p>
<p> I happily applied to Arquetopia, and -- much to my delight -- I am part of the 22% of 329 applicants chosen for residencies this calendar year.  Unfortunately, my income has  decreased this semester (I'm an adjunct professor) and I no longer have the necessary funds to take this incredible opportunity.</p>
<p>Because I believe people have a right to know exactly what they are supporting, let me be fully transparent: $1,600 will go to the remaining balance of the residency, $700 will cover airfare, and the remaining $400 will go towards art supplies and shipping rewards to my wonderful donors. (I am flexible if you'd prefer a reward not mentioned.)</p>
<p>I am going to try my best to attend this residency, but if I cannot, your generosity will go towards a new art collective that Hayley Brotherton, Elizabeth Wallace, Doug Kaylor, and I are creating.  I cannot share too much on our collective yet, but soon we will be able to release our mission statement.  Stay tuned!</p>
<p>Not to be overly confident, but I do have faith that I will have no issues fulfilling the goals of this project and putting your generosity to good use.  I create art regularly -- whether by performing or painting -- in addition to being a responsible teacher.  Being an artist is central to who I am and I am thrilled at the prospect of spending a month abroad discovering, connecting, becoming inspired, and creating.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for viewing my campaign!  If you feel led to do so, please make a contribution and choose a reward.  In making that contribution, you will be supporting my project, Arquetopia's mission of cultural exchange through the arts, and giving a new art collective exposure.  So, whatever the donation, you will be doing a great deal!</p>
<p>Again, many, many thanks!  Feel free to share my campaign and please email me at julieroundtree@gmail.com with any questions.</p>

Queremos renovar ese compromiso con el cine, el arte, la cultura local y regional, y retomar el cuestionamiento de la territorialidad del cine como concepto.</li>
<li>Porque este evento <strong>valoriza el trabajo de estos casi diez años del Laboratorio</strong>, mostrando en una sala céntrica la producción nacional en diálogo con films de otras latitudes. </li>

</div></div>","¿Qué es Laboratorio de Cine del fac?
La Fundación de Arte Contemporáneo (fac) es un colectivo de artistas que promueven e investigan el arte y pensamiento contemporáneos en Montevideo desde el año 1999. Allí nace en el 2007 el laboratorio de cine, un espacio de creación e investigación sobre la imagen fotoquímica dentro del campo.
En estos casi 10 años hemos consolidado un grupo de cineastas independientes trabajando desde la autogestión, llevando a cabo actividades destinadas a preservar el celuloide, promover prácticas artistas en este soporte, crear circuitos alternativos para la difusión del cine experimental, con el fin último de subvertir la hegemonía de la imagen digital y potenciando una nueva forma de relacionamiento con la imagen analógica en sus diferentes formatos.
El corazón del laboratorio son las redes nacionales e internacionales que como vasos comunicantes de saberes y experiencias nos han fortalecido y potenciado como proyecto. Siendo el primer run film lab de la región, somos un espacio de referencia para todo aquel que quiera relacionarse con el celuloide.

 
¿Qué es MVD Cine Experimental?
Una semana dedicada a reflexionar sobre el cine experimental, con proyecciones, encuentros, charlas, muestras. Un espacio donde interactúan referentes históricos con artistas emergentes; donde escuchar a los grandes artistas y pensadores del momento compartir sus metodologías, estrategias, investigaciones, técnicas específicas de creación sobre el celuloide y mucho más.

 
¿Por qué una semana dedicada al Cine Experimental?

Porque Montevideo fue sede del Festival de Cine Documental y Experimental del SODRE desde 1954 a 1971, referencia para los cineastas experimentales de todo el mundo. Queremos renovar ese compromiso con el cine, el arte, la cultura local y regional, y retomar el cuestionamiento de la territorialidad del cine como concepto.
Porque este evento valoriza el trabajo de estos casi diez años del Laboratorio, mostrando en una sala céntrica la producción nacional en diálogo con films de otras latitudes. 
Porque se proyectarán por primera vez cine experimental en una sala de difusión masiva, hasta el momento las obras de los artistas podían verse en galerías de arte, o festivales específicos. La muestra en sala valoriza el trabajo de estos cineastas, cuestiona las actuales prácticas de distribución y posiciona al cine experimental como un arte para todo público, y a Uruguay como referente en la región.
Porque todas las actividades están pensadas para promover una sinergia entre los diferentes agentes del cine; los artistas, las salas, el público, los pensadores, educadores, agentes nacionales e internacionales cruzando experiencias y métodos para potenciar el trabajo creativo y colaborativo. Un espacio de encuentros e intercambios que promueva un futuro de producción y pensamiento desde Uruguay y hacia Uruguay.
Porque es necesario brindar herramientas de formación al público local. Haremos actividades de extensión planteadas en centros educativos dedicados al audiovisual y con la presencia de reconocidos artistas internacionales, la filmmakers coop, Eugeni Bonet.
Porque es necesario volver a pensar las distintas aristas que plantea el circuito del cine experimental desde sus comienzos; nuevas formas de distribución, metodologías disruptivas, estrategias colaborativas, etc.


¿Quiénes nos apoyan y por qué?
El festival ya es una realidad gracias al trabajo honorario de los integrantes del laboratorio, sumado a la colaboración de actores nacionales e internacionales que, como nosotros, confían en la importancia de una semana dedicada al cine experimental.
La Filmmakers Coop compartirá una selección de artistas históricos que se exhibirá por primera vez en Uruguay. Los artistas  Steve Holmgren (L.A.),MM Serra (NYC) en colaboración con Carolina Mandía y el colectivo Club de Súper 8 (Arg)  autofinancian su participación. El Centro Cultural de España hace posible las presentaciones de María Ruido y Eugeni Bonet.
La Sala Zitarrosa, una de las principales promotoras del festival, ofrece su sala para la exhibición de obras nacionales, permitiendo por fin una difusión masiva de artistas uruguayos. El Museo Nacional de Artes Visuales abrirá especialmente sus puertas para que Montevideo pueda ver por primera vez una retrospectiva histórica de la Filmmakers Coop. El Espacio de Arte Contemporáneo (EAC) y el espacio GEN-Artes y Ciencias serán sede para charlas y proyecciones, y residencia para algunos de los artistas invitados. Colabora también Galería Xippas, cediendo la obra de Cao Guimaraes para el programa de la Sala Zitarrosa.                       El lanzamiento será en la Colección Engelman Ost,por ser un espacio pionero en abrir sus puertas a este tipo de prácticas. 
Los invitados internacionales compartirán sus trabajos con estudiantes del CLAEH, Sem.III -IENBA y otras facultades ligadas al tema.
El artista mexicano Antar Kuri, uno de los primeros en integrar el celuloide a su práctica artística, realizará una filmperformance ""Homenaje al celuloide"" en el lanzamiento del festival. 
 

 
¿Por qué un homenaje al celuloide? 
Nuestro colectivo basa su trabajo en la preservación del celuloide y desde allí desarrolla su práctica artística. A partir del Apagón analógico impuesto por la Unión Europea se ha logrado hegemonizar la técnologia digital, y este evento busca sostener nuestra estandarte.

¿Por qué colaborar?

Porque todo artista debe ganar por su trabajo. Queremos pagar un fee acorde a los cánones internacionales.
Porque nos permitirá descentralizar las actividades, generando nuevos circuitos de difusión y reflexión, y multiplicar nuestra metodología de trabajo invitando  a colegas del interior del país a que asistan al Encuentro de Talleres.
Porque publicaremos un fanzine que nos permita ampliar la propuesta mediante la  publicación de entrevistas a los artistas, textos teóricos e información sobre las películas.
Porque queremos realizar un compilado de todo el material y compartir con el resto del mundo.

Para difundir masivamente el festival.

Porque queremos hacer una fiesta de lanzamiento para agasajar a todos los involucrados, especialmente al público del festival.  
Porque nos gusta que todas las actividades sean gratuitas y abiertas a todo público.

Also you will have the chance to purchase in advance the book and get it signed with a personal dedication.<br/>Finally you could buy some of the original artworks.<br/>In case I won’t reach the total sum, the money will still be shared between the cost of the book production, the perks and the campaign. <br/><b>The Impact</b> <br/>As far as I know this is the first kind of project that by using elements found on the flags and emblems of the countries around the world, tells a story based on a vision of equality and brotherhood among the nations.  I believe it is my task as an illustrator to communicate these types of messages. This is something fundamental to me because I consider art to be something that is <b>""made by the people for the people""</b>, and illustration, like any other form of art, should reflect human desires and hopes, as well as problems and fears.  <br/><b>Risks &amp; Challenges </b><br/>This is my first illustrated book;  I have been working on this project for the last five years and I’m now coming to the end.  At the beginning the sketches took different directions, but after a few false starts I realized that I did not want to create just some images, but I wanted tell a story based on a vision of equality and brotherhood among the nations.  After working over and over again on the storyboard, eventually the story was completed by creating 32 images.<br/>Each image is painted by hand on a cardboard measuring 40x60cm (23,62 x 15,75 inches). The illustrations were painted in this format because I enjoy painting big images and because I wish to exhibit them in a gallery.<br/><b> Other Ways You Can Help</b><br/> If you like this project and want to support it, please have a look at the various perks that you could choose from.  <br/><br/>If you prefer, you can also help by telling other people about the Across the Free Land campaign. Thanks for helping to make this project a reality!  <br/><b>The Rewards</b></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474888747/Perks_visual_NEW_m6kzla.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477046795/swhcqeqvuyhzhnthqzjy.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473926346/Approaching_the_land_of_hands_3_postcard_oepcwj.jpg"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p><p>The Land of Hands postcard</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473926257/SIYINQABA_POSTCARD_4_pwijsu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>The Tower postcard</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473926311/PEACE_TO_ALL_HANDS_A3-A4_PRINT_jsejyv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Peace to all Hands print</p><div><div><div>

Also you will have the chance to purchase in advance the book and get it signed with a personal dedication.Finally you could buy some of the original artworks.In case I won’t reach the total sum, the money will still be shared between the cost of the book production, the perks and the campaign. The Impact As far as I know this is the first kind of project that by using elements found on the flags and emblems of the countries around the world, tells a story based on a vision of equality and brotherhood among the nations.  I believe it is my task as an illustrator to communicate these types of messages. This is something fundamental to me because I consider art to be something that is ""made by the people for the people"", and illustration, like any other form of art, should reflect human desires and hopes, as well as problems and fears.  Risks & Challenges This is my first illustrated book;  I have been working on this project for the last five years and I’m now coming to the end.  At the beginning the sketches took different directions, but after a few false starts I realized that I did not want to create just some images, but I wanted tell a story based on a vision of equality and brotherhood among the nations.  After working over and over again on the storyboard, eventually the story was completed by creating 32 images.Each image is painted by hand on a cardboard measuring 40x60cm (23,62 x 15,75 inches). The illustrations were painted in this format because I enjoy painting big images and because I wish to exhibit them in a gallery. Other Ways You Can Help If you like this project and want to support it, please have a look at the various perks that you could choose from.  If you prefer, you can also help by telling other people about the Across the Free Land campaign. Thanks for helping to make this project a reality!  The Rewards    The Land of Hands postcard  The Tower postcard Peace to all Hands print

De plus, le mot Factrie était très utilisé dans les années 60 pour faire référence aux manufactures, telles que notre fameuse Montreal Cotton. </p>
<p>Le projet est né à la suite d’une étude de marché sous forme d'entrevues et de sondages qui ont été menés auprès de 150 personnes de la communauté.

Toutefois, l'offre en matière de culture et de restauration reste à Salaberry-de-Valleyfield somme toute importante. Il sera important de ne pas diluer l'offre culturelle. La Fatrie ne veut pas devenir une concurrente pour les acteurs déjà en place, mais bien une offre complémentaire qui attire une nouvelle clientèle. Elle devra s'appuyer sur les efforts d’un maximum d’acteurs travaillant en concertation. Dans tous les cas, il paraît essentiel que l’une des missions de La Factrie soit le développement de public culturel et la création de synergies entre l’ensemble des organismes culturels sur le territoire de la ville.

<p>Pour minimiser les coûts d’exploitation du café culturel, il est clair que l’engagement bénévole de plusieurs utilisateurs du café sera nécessaire au sein du conseil d’administration, de comités de programmation et pour l’accomplissement de tâches courantes simples à effectuer.</p>
<p>Le fait de se baser sur le bénévolat est une formule gagnante qui a fait ses preuves à plusieurs reprises dans d’autres cafés culturels à travers le Québec. Cependant, on peut noter dans la région une baisse de l'implication bénévole au cours des dernières années, ainsi qu'un épuisement des bénévoles eux-mêmes.

Night time. A Turkish pedicab driver hails a good looking actress. Not completely unusual, is it? She's got the looks, she's got the part, and she's pursuing her dream. He's a foreigner, he's got a not so glorious job, and he's probably not that wise. Right? Not quite. She's lost and unsatified, while he's grounded and happy. The lesson? He'll tell her. They'll tell you.                           DANCES : WHAT & WHY?Contemporary/experimental style. Why ? ... Or why not?! Dancing is freeing, and has the amazing ability to convey powerful messages without a word or a sound other than the music setting up the tone and leading the moves.If the plays are the singers of this show, the dances are the instruments - they shall go together.              ALL TOGETHER, WHAT IS THE SHOW ABOUT?As simple and obvious as the words « free your mind, free yourself »  say it : if you free your mind up, you'll free yourself up, which will indirectly also help others by « playing your honest card » and owning up to your position in society, instead of letting society tell you what card to play.So free ourselves from what exactly ? From ideas we have of things, of ourselves, of other people… What a ""great job"" is, what a ""good person"" looks like, what we ""should do"" and who we should be, as well as others around us. The truth is, there is no ""who we should be"" and ""what we should do"" other than being whom we truly want to be by doing what makes our heart beat.We are humans. We are society. We all matter. On different levels, we all have an impact on each other and need each other. And at the end of the day, we’re just and only evolved animals with basic needs at the core : health and love.You know the blinders we put on horses so they can’t get scared by what's around ? Maybe that’s what we tend to put on as well. So why not remove the blinders and choose to see ? Why not promoting love instead of fear, and accept, even cherish the differences between each other ?Don't be a prisoner, set yourself free!               WHY THE SHOW?I (writer/producer) moved to NYC a few years ago, and am realizing the impact this city has had on me and the person I’m becoming thanks to it. Part of it is that it’s made me way more understanding of myself and others, which made me more accepting as well, and more at peace as a result. But it’s also made me very much aware of the way we tend to behave when we don’t know about something or someone: we are scared, we assume, we put in boxes, we judge, and overall we just hurt ourselves and others.Hurt? Yes, hurt. We miss opportunities to connect and bound with others, we put so much pressure on ourselves with fulfilling ideas that in the end are just ideas and truly are empty of meaning to US, we miss the moment by working towards ""becoming"" instead of being… and so on.So since I am an artist and not a spokesperson… I wanted to share my feelings and ideas in a lighter way with a wonderful team of talented artists- with art. With stories. By showing, instead of saying.              WHY SHOULD YOU HELP ?Cause we can’t do a great show without you !If you’ve read the above and agree, or are intrigued, if you want to come laugh and cry with us, or if you simply want to help artists make art and touch others, then I believe this is something you’d like to help us bring to life.What your money will go towards ? Paying for the space, the design, the costumes, the prints, the team… All that makes a show, a show.                             A CORE TEAM: WHO IS WHO?The director: Renoly Santiago.Renoly is known to audiences worldwide for his memorable performances starring with Hollywood’s most respected actors in four number one blockbuster films.  He made his film debut in ‘Dangerous Minds’ alongside Michelle Pfeiffer. His movie credits include: ‘Hackers’ with Angelina Jolie, ‘Daylight’ with Sylvester Stallone, also ‘Con Air’ with Nicolas Cage and John Malkovich. He appears in indie films such as ‘Punks’ at Sundance Film Festival, ‘The Street King’, ‘Just Another Romantic Wrestling Comedy’ and ‘Lavoe: The Untold Story’, as Latin music legend Johnny Pacheco. Among his episodic television appearances are guest leads in ‘Law & Order: Criminal Intent’, ‘Touched by an Angel’, ‘Big Apple’ and ‘Stand Up’. Renoly was nominated for a Drama Desk Award by the press as Outstanding Featured Performer in a Musical in his Broadway debut ‘The Capeman’ written and composed by Paul Simon.  He starred alongside Marc Anthony, Ednita Nazario and Ruben Blades. He has appeared in many off-Broadway productions under such notable directors as Liz Swados in Lincoln Center, in workshops with Graciella Danielle in ‘Blood Wedding’ and Gabriel Barre in the Kander & Ebb musical ‘Skin of Our Teeth’.                The writer and producer: Mathilde Dehaye.Mathilde moved from Belgium to NYC right upon graduation to pursue an acting career. With one year left at The Lee Strasberg Theatre & Film Institute and a yearly writing contest coming up, she decides to take a playwriting class and to have people read her for the first time. She later submits her full length play 'Snow White and The Beast' to The Strasberg Works writing contest. She wins the award (2014) picked by Margaret Ladd (Falcon Crest, A Wedding, Mozart in the Jungle) who became her writing adviser, and the play is tapped for production in July 2014. After a full theatre every night and many messages from people touched by the show, Mathilde's next ambition became to utilize her writing to get a deeper involvement with her work. The adaptation of the play into a short film ('Rhythm in Me') to pitch a feature made its way to CANNES Film Festival 2016, and Mathilde continues to write future projects that hopefully will move as many people as possible.                The choreographers: Kianna Moye and Katie Kilbourn.Born Dance Company is a team of collaborating artists led by New York based choreographers Kianna Moye and Katie Kilbourn.

The Pendulum Project is a year-long collaborative curatorial initiative to increase the exposure and recognition of students and emerging artists in Toronto and build community through art and conversation.

Curatorial Statement

Our curatorial aim is to collaboratively manifest the talent of students and aspiring art professionals through a multidisciplinary investigation of themes pertaining to migration, marginalization and identity. Our exhibition series is centred around empowerment and will focus on unravelling the ambiguity of contemporary social issues such as political apathy and racial, religious and gender-based discrimination.


Event Programming
Our 2016 programming consists of a curated series of quarterly solo & group exhibitions. A total of four shows will be hosted throughout the year; each of which will stay up for a duration of a week and a half. Scheduling encompasses an opening night, a film screening and an artist talk/panel discussion tackling central issues related to each show. Artwork will be for sale.SpaceThe Pendulum Project will be hosted at Studio 223A: a bright, naturally lit studio/gallery space located in the heart of Kensington Market.   

What We Need We're looking to raise $4000 (CAD) for The Pendulum Project. It may not sound like much, but these means will be evenly distributed throughout the year to cover the cost of four feature exhibitions and respective panel discussions and film screenings.
Funding will be going towards:

Studio + Installation Fees (maintenance, licensing, artwork/event insurance)
Production (materials, printing, framing)
Staff Fees (because we believe in recognizing the dedication, hours and energy that artists put into creating and sharing their work) 

BONUS: We are also applying to a handful of micro-grants directed towards youth-led initiatives in the city.

Art Exhibitions
Panel Discussions
Film Screenings 
Studio 223A has hosted a handful of art & music happenings in the past and program director Alexia Bréard-Anderson (Lexiquette) also has a few curated exhibitions and pop-up events under her belt: the most recent one being for Toronto-based charity organization Women in Music & Arts in support of survivors of rape culture and domestic violence.

<p>Our story begins with a few artistically oriented entrepreneurs who wished to make a line of ethically-produced) clothing that would spark individual creativity, while truly making a difference for the Earth.</p>
<p>This project began by our love for the planet and the survival of the sentient beings that populate her. As artists, we searched for a way for people to truly give more of themselves from the heart while purchasing beautiful products, while helping to protect endangered species around the globe and empower underprivileged people, both here in the US and in underdeveloped countries.</p>
<p>We have created coloring books and art to wear clothing from the idea of the tremendously popular coloring books for adults. The clothing focuses on a coloring book design of an endangered species that you can color yourself, creating your very own individual wearable art. The clothing and the books, both educate about the most critically endangered species and how we, collectively and individually can help turn the loss of any species around as proceeds are given back to help protect endangered species around the globe. The Earth is a closed system and the waste we produce does not disappear, it only builds up. Whether by toxicity, poaching or loss of habitat it only takes a few species disappearing to collapse the perfect balance that ultimately allows us, humans, to be hosted upon this fragile Earth. We must begin to live in harmony.</p>

<h3><b>Details...details...details...</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>We have chosen to carry both Organic Cotton T-shirts, made here in the US, as well as our own personal line made of natural Micromodal (European Birch tree fiber) fabric from Turkey.</p>
<p>Natural fibers such as bamboo, rayon and Micromodal are organic only from the start. Though the material is labeled “organic” because the original plant was organically grown, the fiber itself, in actuality, is not. Solvents are used to dissolve the cellulose dur?ng the spinning process in order to create yarn. We prefer truth in advertising as the process used to break these fibers down are a non-organic process. Though we legally can, like many do, call it organic, we will not.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461095806/IMG_1125_vpkriv.jpg"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p>
<p>While our organic cotton t-shirts are ""all USA"", including the sewing, our line of Micromodal Tees will be sewn in a developing country by women supporting their families. We will insure that the work conditions are neither physically nor financially abusive to the workers. We are one world and to help a neighbor, be it next door or the next country, is to help humans all over the planet to live happier, healthier and kinder lives. We have chosen to empower women both in the US as well as women in other nations.</p>
<p>By purchasing a Color Me Free™ product, you can not only buy an ethical product that bears your final creativity, you can also help others be kinder to their fellow beings on this planet, be it the abandoned dog or cat or the endangered species we are losing daily at an alarming rate. Much of the devastation of our environment is from people simply trying to survive. You can take pressure off of the environment by supporting them in more productive and lucrative ways as well as educating them in the fact that destroying our environment is ultimately destroying the human race.</p>

<p>Every purchase you make from the ""Color Me Free™"" line is empowering underprivileged individuals here and abroad and sending money directly to help endangered species around the globe. Unlike most companies which give, on average, 10% of their profits to similar projects, we will be donating a minimum of 25% of our profits to one or more specific endangered species projects. To us that felt fairer. We hope you agree and participate.</p>

Details...details...details...

We have chosen to carry both Organic Cotton T-shirts, made here in the US, as well as our own personal line made of natural Micromodal (European Birch tree fiber) fabric from Turkey.
Natural fibers such as bamboo, rayon and Micromodal are organic only from the start. Though the material is labeled “organic” because the original plant was organically grown, the fiber itself, in actuality, is not. Solvents are used to dissolve the cellulose dur?ng the spinning process in order to create yarn. We prefer truth in advertising as the process used to break these fibers down are a non-organic process. Though we legally can, like many do, call it organic, we will not.


While our organic cotton t-shirts are ""all USA"", including the sewing, our line of Micromodal Tees will be sewn in a developing country by women supporting their families. We will insure that the work conditions are neither physically nor financially abusive to the workers. We are one world and to help a neighbor, be it next door or the next country, is to help humans all over the planet to live happier, healthier and kinder lives. We have chosen to empower women both in the US as well as women in other nations.
By purchasing a Color Me Free™ product, you can not only buy an ethical product that bears your final creativity, you can also help others be kinder to their fellow beings on this planet, be it the abandoned dog or cat or the endangered species we are losing daily at an alarming rate. Much of the devastation of our environment is from people simply trying to survive. You can take pressure off of the environment by supporting them in more productive and lucrative ways as well as educating them in the fact that destroying our environment is ultimately destroying the human race.



Every purchase you make from the ""Color Me Free™"" line is empowering underprivileged individuals here and abroad and sending money directly to help endangered species around the globe. Unlike most companies which give, on average, 10% of their profits to similar projects, we will be donating a minimum of 25% of our profits to one or more specific endangered species projects. To us that felt fairer. We hope you agree and participate.



What We Need & What You Get  
*Our time to finish the work of the illustrations of 40 endangered species done in the Zentangle tradition for production of the coloring book.
*Printing costs of the coloring book as well as advertising and distribution.
*A full website for the Color Me Free line of art prints, coloring books and t-shirts.
*Research and travel for overseeing production of the clothing line as well as advertising and distribution.
*Production of a line of Micromodal T-Shirts, which includes, samples, patterns, fabric and full fabrication and printing with the Zentangle designs of endangered species.
*For your donation to get this project off of the ground you will receive gifts in the way of Endangered Species prints, coloring books, organic t-shirts and coloring sets  to create your own personal masterpiece as well as personal illustrations, depending on the package you choose. 





The Impact...
You are helping us to create a vehicle for change for both humans and animals. By donating to this campaign you are helping us put products out there that are not only beautiful but fun and educational. You are helping consumers to consciously support this planet and her inhabitants in ways that those on the frontline will receive the funds they need to educate and help communities in order to keep these beautiful animals alive. It is the grass root projects that truly make the biggest impact because their hearts, like yours, are focused on their goal, not their pocket book. It is these projects that we will be funding with at least 25% of our profits from future sales. Our goal is to reach even higher toward a 50% donation margin in the future.




Most Importantly... Even if you cannot donate at this time, please help us get the word out. Tweet, Post and Share! Thank you for taking the time and contributing in any way to our heartfelt project. We greatly appreciate it!",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b><a href=""https://origamihousecolonia.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">OrigamiHouse Colonia</a></b> is the name of the upcoming museum of paperfolding in Colonia del Sacramento, Uruguay. We aim to open by September of 2016. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am raising funds to build the <b>display components</b> of the exhibition based on a design rendered by museum experts. This includes the furnishings (lighting system, pedestals, wall partitions, glass cases) and content production (narrative, scripts and signage). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The origami community from around the world has been very supportive to this project. I have been receiving models from as far as Russia, Israel, Singapore, Spain, USA, and Brazil, to name just a few countries. Many are from well-known masters and also from young and promising ""rising stars"".  </p>
<p>And the great news is that more than 30 artists who participated in <i><a href=""http://www.artsandartists.org/exhibitions/past-foldingpaper/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Folding Paper, the Infinite Possibilities of Origami</a>, </i>agreed to donate their work. Folding Paper was the famous, groundbreaking exhibition, that toured the USA for four years! Now these models will find a permanent home in Uruguay. </p>
<p>The project has received the attention of museum planners who have been offering generous advice on exhibit design and implementation. </p>
<p>With everyone's help, it will be a museum like no other. All the furnishing and content will be customized to achieve the high standards that we envision. <b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">It will be a modern, educational and fun place to visit and experience hands-on activities. </b></p>
<p>So now it is time to put all these wonderful ideas to work. And to do that we need funding.</p>
<p>You can be part of this great project! You may tell your grandchildren:<i> ""I helped create one of the first museums of paperfolding in the world!""</i></p>

<p>The goal is to raise $27,400. If we raise less, we'll have to adapt to a lower budget. If we raise more, all the better, as we'll be able to further fund programs and activities.</p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;"">My story and how the idea took shape</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>For several years I have been working on a project called <a href=""http://www.origamiartmuseumcolonia.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Origami Art Museum Colonia – Museo del Plegado de Papel y Talleres</a>, aimed at bringing the art of paperfolding (also called origami) to South America.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Origami has experienced an unprecedented transformation in the second part of the 21st century. From a traditional children's pastime, it has progressed into a true art form, attracting the minds of scientists, artists and designers. New techniques have developed, leading to a vast range of styles, complexities, and subject matters. Read more about the impact of origami in science <a href=""http://www.origami-resource-center.com/origami-science.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>
<h4><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Now is the time for an Origami Museum </b></h4>
<p>Artists have been exhibiting in galleries with great success. But these venues do not address all issues related to the preservation of this art. There is a growing concern about the need to preserve models and documents, and to show the world how origami has evolved. The only answer to these questions is a museum of paperfolding, where <b>people of all walks of life can learn and experience the magic of folding paper and at the same time become a center for conservation and research on the history of paperfolding and its connections with other disciplines.</b></p>
<p style=""letter-spacing: normal;"">I began to think about this project in 2008, inspired in part by a visit to an origami exhibition at the Parrish Museum in Southampton, NY. That evening, I was lucky to attend a sneak preview of the arward-winning documentary<a href=""http://www.greenfusefilms.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> Between the Folds</a>. Directed by Vanessa Gould, the film illuminated <i>""the beauty, complexity and powerful duality of origami in the 21st century""</i> and it was a mind-opener to me. I thought there should be a place where people could go and experience the possibilities of paperfolding. The logical answer was a museum, but there were virtually no museums of that kind in the Western world. Even the word “museum” sounded a little daunting. I was concerned that it would require deep pockets and a large structure. Unless one could manage to make it smaller: a small house may suit the needs of an origami exhibition, along with community outreach programming and workshops.</p>
<p style=""letter-spacing: normal;""> </p>
<p>At that moment I was living in the United States. Being a paperfolder for most of my life, I approached <a href=""https://origamiusa.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">OrigamiUSA</a>, the largest community of paperfolders in the world. Over the next few years I developed strong ties with international origami artists. I served on the Board of OrigamiUSA and became the managing editor of <a href=""https://origamiusa.org/thepaper"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Paper</a>, its print magazine. As I began to gain confidence, I shared my vision with my paperfolder friends. With no exception, everyone encouraged me to follow my dream.</p>
<h4>
<b>From dream to reality</b><br/><span style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;"">However, the main question remained. Where? What would be the ideal location for this kind of venture? I'm a little bit of an idealist... I like to ""plant seeds"". </span><b style=""font-size: 16px;letter-spacing: 0px;"">What would be better than a modest place with great potential to grow?</b><span style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;""> Countries like Argentina and Uruguay </span><span style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;"">–</span><span style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;"">where I spent my childhood years </span><span style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;"">–</span><span style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;"">had the ingredients I was looking for: strong tourism, local creativity, inspiring culture and breathtaking landscapes. Time and again, the vision of old memories along the banks of River Plate (Río de la Plata) crossed my mind. And one town in particular, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonia_del_Sacramento"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Colonia del Sacramento</a>, in Uruguay, seemed to qualify for my project.</span><span style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;"">  </span>

<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>While I was enjoying the sweet feeling of success, my friends interrogated me with down-to-earth questions: <i>""How are you going to manage the museum?""</i>, they wanted to know. And I said: <i>""It's going to be a lot of work, but I think it's doable. I settled myself in Colonia.  I live here. I guess it will be like running an atelier or a gallery. I will be in the house/museum doing what I like to do. During the day, the exhibition will be open to the public, and in the evenings and weekends there will be workshops. We'll do local and regional community outreach. The museum will keep an historical archive and will create opportunities for people to work here and do research.""  </i></p>
<p>It's a big responsibility, I know. And I am grateful to the many friends who have been supporting and believe in the idea. Reaching out to you now for funding creates an even  broader compromise. But I take on the challenge happily because at the end of the day having a little museum of paperfolding is what the tiny child who still lives in me always wanted. I've been living on this wonderful planet for more than half a century (wow!) and I feel as strong as ever and ready to start a journey for which I've been preparing myself for so many years. <b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">What I know for sure is that I won't be alone. </b></p>

<h3><b>What else?</b></h3>I know some of you may think that this is not something that you are going to be able to visit in the short term because of the distance from your home. So why bother contributing? Although it would be great if you could come and visit it (and we hope you'll do one day!), think about this: Your contribution will help this museum become a destination for origami lovers from all over the world. And once this project is up and running, it will also become <b>an example for others to imitate</b>, and more museums of this kind may open in different parts of the world! <h3> </h3>

<h3>Introducción </h3>
<p><b><a href=""https://origamihousecolonia.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">OrigamiHouse Colonia</a></b> es el nombre del museo del plegado del papel que estamos construyendo en Colonia del Sacramento, Uruguay. El objetivo es inaugurarlo hacia septiembre de este año. </p>
<p>Los fondos recaudados servirán para construir los componentes de la exhibición de acuerdo al proyecto diseñado por un equipo de expertos en museología. Esto incluye el equipamiento (sistema de iluminación, pedestales, paredes divisorias, cajas de vidrio) así como la producción de contenido (narrativa, guión y señalización). </p>
<p>La comunidad de origami mundial ha mostrado su apoyo decisivo a este proyecto. Hemos venido recibiendo modelos de Rusia, Israel, Singapur, España, Estados Unidos, Brasil, por nombrar unos pocos países. Hay trabajos de creadores eximios y de jóvenes talentosos. </p>
<p>El proyecto ha recibido la atención de planificadores de museos que han ofrecido su generoso asesoramiento en materia de exhibición e implementación. </p>
<p>Con la ayuda de todos, este será un museo singular. Todo el equipamiento y el contenido se harán a medida para lograr la calidad buscada. Será un lugar moderno, educativo y divertido para visitar y experimentar con actividades prácticas. </p>
<p>Este es el momento de poner en práctica todas estas maravillosas ideas y por eso estamos llevando a cabo esta recaudación. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Usted puede ser parte de un gran proyecto! Un proyecto que le permitirá decir a sus nietos: <i>""¡Yo ayudé a crear uno de los primeros museos de plegado del papel del mundo!""</i></p>
<p>A continuación explicaremos cómo puede contribuir. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">¡No olvide difundir esta campaña entre sus conocidos! </span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Su generosa donación hará posible...  </h3>
<p> </p>
<p>El objetivo es recaudar 27,400 dólares. Si no se alcanza esta cifra, habrá que adaptarse a un menor prespuesto. Si se recauda más más, podremos avanzar en la programación de actividades. (Los siguientes valores están expresados en dólares norteamericanos)</p>
<ol>
<li>$3,000  para finalizar el aislamiento de las paredes externas y para proyectar un sistema de control de humedad en los exhibidores. </li>
<li>$20,000 para el el <b>diseño de la exhibición, construcción e instalación del equipamiento</b>, incluyendo iluminación de alta calidad, pedestales, cajas de vidrio/acrílico, paredes divisiorias. </li>
<li>$2,400 ayudarán a cubrir los costos de <b>transporte </b>de Nueva York a Uruguay de más de 30 piezas recientemente donadas por artistas que participaron en la exhibición <i><i><a href=""http://www.artsandartists.org/exhibitions/past-foldingpaper/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Folding Paper, the Infinite Possibilities of Origami</a></i></i>, que viajó por Estados Unidos durante cuatro años y tendrán un destino final en el museo de Uruguay.   </li>
<li>$2,000 Para la producción de material de promoción y actividades prácticas. </li>
</ol>
<p>¿Y si logramos recaudar <i>más</i> de 27,400 dólares? Sería genial, pues entonces podremos  comenzar a programar los siguientes pasos: </p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Proyectos con la comunidad local y regional (por ejemplo ir a escuelas o invitar a los alumnos al museo)</li>
<li>Un programa de residencia de artistas: invitaremos a origamistas internacionales para que pasen un tiempo desarrollando un proyecto de origami en Colonia. </li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Mi historia y cómo se gestó esta idea</b></h3>
<p>Concebí este proyecto hace varios años con la idea de desarrollar un museo del plegado del papel en América del Sur:<a href=""http://www.origamiartmuseumcolonia.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> </a><i><i><a href=""http://www.origamiartmuseumcolonia.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Origami Art Museum Colonia  – Museo del Plegado de Papel y Talleres</a>.</i></i></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">El origami ha experimentado una transformación fenomenal en la segunda mitad del siglo XX. De pasatiempo infantil, se ha convertido en un verdadero arte que atrae el interés de artistas, científicos y diseñadores por igual. Se han desarrollado técnicas, algunas muy complejas que involucran algoritmos matemáticos, y que dieron lugar a diversos estilos, complejidads y temáticas. Para leer más sobre el impacto del origami en las ciencias, pulse <a href=""http://www.origami-resource-center.com/origami-science.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">aquí</a>.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><b>El momento del museo es ahora</b></h3>
<p>Numerosos artistas han exhibido en importantes galerías y museos. Pero estas instancias no contemplan a fondo las cuestiones relativas a la preservación de este arte. Hay una creciente preocupación sobre la necesidad de preservar modelos y documentos, y de mostrar al mundo lo que ya se ha hecho. La respuesta a estas cuestiones es el museo del plegado del papel, donde <b>los visitantes tengan la oportunidad de aprender y experimentar y desde el cual se consolide un centro de conservación e investigación de la historia del plegado del papel y sus conexiones con otras disciplinas.</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Comencé con la idea del museo en el año 2008, a partir de una exhibición que vi en el Parrish Museum de Southampton, New York. Esa tarde, además, tuve la suerte de ver el anticipo del documental <a href=""http://www.greenfusefilms.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> Between the Folds</a> (que luego recibiría muchos premios). Dirigido por Vanessa Gould, la película iluminaba <i>""la belleza, complejidad y poderosa dualidad del origami en el siglo XXI""</i>, y eso fue lo que literalmente me abrió la cabeza. Pensé que debería haber un lugar donde la gente pudiera tener una experiencia de este tipo. Lo lógico era un museo, pero no había ninguno en Occidente. Incluso la palabra ""museo"" suena algo temeraria. Pensé que sería necesario muchísimo dinero para armar una gran estructura. A menos que se hiciera algo más pequeño: una casa podría servir para exhibir modelos de origami, a lo que se podrían agregar programas y talleres para la comunidad. </p>
<p>En ese entonces aún vivía en los Estados Unidos. Como siempre me interesó el origami, me acerqué a  <a href=""https://origamiusa.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">OrigamiUSA</a>, la mayor comunidad de plegadores del mundo. Me conecté con artistas y formé parte del directorio de OrigamiUSA, además de ser actualmente la editora de su revista impresa, <i><a href=""https://origamiusa.org/thepaper"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Paper</a></i>. Mis amigos y colegas me alentaron a seguir con mi sueño. </p>
<h3><b>De la idea a la realidad</b></h3>
<p>La gran pregunta seguía pendiente. <i>¿Dónde? </i> ¿Cuál era el lugar ideal para llevar adelante este emprendimiento? Soy un poco idealista, me gusta ""plantar semillas"". <b>Pensé que la mejor manera de hacerlo sería en un lugar que no tuviese tantos recursos económicos, pero sí, en cambio, un gran potencial para establecer un museo del plegado del papel. </b>Países como la Argentina y el Uruguay, donde pasé mi infancia y juventud, tenían los ingredientes que estaba buscando: un fuerte turismo, creatividad local, cultura vibrante y hermosos paisajes. Una y otra vez volvía el recuerdo de la costa oriental del Río de la Plata. Y una ciudad en particular, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonia_del_Sacramento"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Colonia del Sacramento</a>, en Uruguay, me pareció perfecta para este proyecto.      <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>               <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453338482/bnmvtxxocoyknvtowzuh.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 464.79452054794524px;height: 520px;""/> </p>
<p>Ubicada en la margen oriental del Río de la Plata, Colonia es una ciudad perdida en el tiempo. Debido a su importancia histórica, ha sido declarada Patrimonio Mundial por la UNESCO. Miles de turistas llegan de todas partes del mundo, por lo general tomando un ferry desde Buenos Aires, dejando atrás el stress de la ciudad. <b>Es como entrar en una postal antigua. </b>Todo es brillante y hermoso e invita a descansar. </p>
<p>                <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453844508/eqynilwajbunbkjwqkvy.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 461.45714285714286px;height: 372px;""/></p>
<h3><b>La casa/museo</b></h3>
<p>En Colonia hay varios museos montados en casas antiguas de dos o tres habitaciones, de modo que un pequeño museo de origami estaría en la escala de lo que la ciudad ofrece. Fue así como en el año 2011 decidí comprar una vieja casona en el Barrio Histórico con la idea de refaccionarla para mi proyecto. </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453844653/cnesejswfz1hbnjnqkwf.jpg"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;width: 322.122905027933px;height: 372px;""/><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453844663/wkfbxfckrs5selywutkl.jpg"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;width: 276.943661971831px;height: 371px;""/></p>
<p>Así también fui coleccionando piezas de origami. Entre ellas, obras de: <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Victor Coeurjoly (Francia/España), Kade Chan (Hong Kong), Román Díaz (Uruguay), Tomoko Fuse (Japón), Paul Fresco (USA), Ilan Garibi (Israel), Roberto Gretter (Italia), Isa Klein (Brasil), Alexander Kurth (Alemania), Ron Koh (Singapur), Goran Konjevod (USA), Robert Lang (USA), Ekaterina Lukasheva (Rusia/USA), Jun Maekawa (Japón), Herman Mariano (Israel), Sejin Park (Corea del Sur/Canada), Ángel Morollón (España), Peter Stein (Alemania), Annarosa Ventura (Italia), Stephan Weber (Alemania), Makoto Yamaguchi (Japón), y otros.</span><br/>.</p>
<p>                <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453848646/vzfevihlxg1hngqicmrz.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 497.15173674588664px;height: 526px;""/></p>
<h3><b>Colección de obras y archivo histórico</b></h3>
<p>OrigamiUSA contribuyó con <b>modelos creados o plegados por niños de diversos países. </b>Las piezas formaron parte de la conocida exhibición itinerante, llamada <i>""Origami by Children""</i>, que organiza todos los años esta institución. </p>
<p>El museo de Colonia también alojará dos colecciones de importancia histórica. Una es la colección <b>Ligia Montoya</b> de libros, cartas y plegados originales que perteneció a la mencionada origamista argentina fallecida en 1967. La otra es <b>el archivo de Gershon Legman</b>, de documentos y cartas de pioneros del origami, como <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Neal Elias (USA), Robert Harbin (Inglaterra), Gershon Legman (USA/Francia), David Lister (UK), Ligia Montoya (Argentina), Lillian Oppenheimer (USA), Sam Randlett (USA), George Rhoads (USA), Vicente Solórzano Sagredo (España/Argentina), Akira Yoshizawa (Japón)<i> </i></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">y otros. El archivo estará disponible para los investigadores de la historia del plegado del papel. </span></p>

<p>En marzo de este año, recibiremos medio centenar de obras creadas por algunos de los más reconocidos origamistas del mundo. Estas piezas pertenecen a la exposición itinerante<b> </b><i><i><i><a href=""http://www.artsandartists.org/exhibitions/past-foldingpaper/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Folding Paper, the Infinite Possibilities of Origami</a></i></i>, </i> que viajó por Estados Unidos durante cuatro años. Su curadora, Meher McArthur, tuvo la generosa idea de proponer que, una vez terminada la exhibición itinerante en Estados Unidos, las piezas viajaran a Uruguay para darles allí una residencia permanente en el museo de Colonia. <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/origamihouse-colonia-museum-of-paperfolding/www.artsandartists.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">International Arts &amp; Artists</a>, la organización sin fines de lucro que produjo esta exposición en Estados Unidos, actuó como intermediaria entre los artistas donantes y el proyecto OrigamiHouse. Entre los artistas que aceptaron donar sus trabajos figuran: <i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Krystyna and Wojtek Burczyk (Polonia), Joel Cooper (USA), Brian Chan (USA), Erik and Martin Demaine (USA), Giang Dinh (Vietnam/USA), Christine Edison (USA), Shuki Kato (USA), Eric Gjerde (USA), Miri Golan (Israel), Tran Trung Hieu (Vietnam), Tom Hull (USA), the late Roy Iwaki (Japón/USA) (gracias a la generosa colaboración de parientes), Paul Jackson (Inglaterra/Israel), Ruth Kitagawa (Japón/USA), Daniel Kwan (USA), Robert Lang (USA), Linda Mihara (Japón/USA), Bernie Peyton (USA), Andrea Russo (Italia), Victoria Sedova (Rusia), Heinz Strobl (Alemania), Nicolas Terry (Francia), and Polly Verity (Inglaterra).</i></p>

<h3>Riesgos y desafíos</h3>
<p>Mientras me entusiasmaba cada vez más con mi idea, mis amigos me hacían preguntas críticas: <i>""¿Y cómo lo vas a manejar?"", </i>querían saber. Mi respuesta fue la siguiente: <i>""Va a ser mucho trabajo, sin duda. Yo ya estoy establecida en Colonia. Vivo aquí. Pienso que será como llevar adelante un atelier o una galería. Durante el día, la exhibición estará abierta al público y por las tardes y fines de semana habrá talleres. Trabajaremos con la comunidad local y regional. El museo mantendrá un archivo histórico y se crearán oportunidades para hacer investigación"". </i></p>
<p>Es una gran responsabilidad. Y estoy agradecida a los amigos que me han apoyado hasta aquí. Ahora, la solicitud de apoyo económico crea un nuevo y mayor compromiso. Pero estoy dispuesta a asumirlo pues, en última instancia, siento que le estoy dando el gusto a la pequeña niña que aún habita en mi, y que siempre soñó con un museo de papel. He vivido en este mundo durante más de medio siglo (uf!) y me siento más fuerte que nunca y lista para emprender esta nueva aventura para la que me preparé durante muchos años. <b>De lo que estoy segura es que no estaré sola.</b> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><b>¿Qué más? </b></h3>
<p>Algunos pensarán que este museo queda muy lejos y no se justifica aportar dinero para esta causa. Es comprensible, y aunque me gustaría que todos puedan visitarlo algún día (ojalá!), creo que también es importante pensar que su contribución ayudará a que el museo se convierta en un <b>destino ineludible para todos los amantes del origami</b>. Además, un proyecto de esta naturaleza servirá de <b>ejemplo a imitar</b> para que en otras partes del mundo se creen museos de este tipo. </p>

OrigamiHouse Colonia is the name of the upcoming museum of paperfolding in Colonia del Sacramento, Uruguay. We aim to open by September of 2016. 
 
I am raising funds to build the display components of the exhibition based on a design rendered by museum experts. This includes the furnishings (lighting system, pedestals, wall partitions, glass cases) and content production (narrative, scripts and signage). 
 
The origami community from around the world has been very supportive to this project. I have been receiving models from as far as Russia, Israel, Singapore, Spain, USA, and Brazil, to name just a few countries. Many are from well-known masters and also from young and promising ""rising stars"".  
And the great news is that more than 30 artists who participated in Folding Paper, the Infinite Possibilities of Origami, agreed to donate their work. Folding Paper was the famous, groundbreaking exhibition, that toured the USA for four years! Now these models will find a permanent home in Uruguay. 
The project has received the attention of museum planners who have been offering generous advice on exhibit design and implementation. 
With everyone's help, it will be a museum like no other. All the furnishing and content will be customized to achieve the high standards that we envision. It will be a modern, educational and fun place to visit and experience hands-on activities. 
So now it is time to put all these wonderful ideas to work. And to do that we need funding.
You can be part of this great project! You may tell your grandchildren: ""I helped create one of the first museums of paperfolding in the world!""
 
Please read further to learn how you can contribute. And don't forget to spread the word among your friends!

What we need 

 
The goal is to raise $27,400. If we raise less, we'll have to adapt to a lower budget. If we raise more, all the better, as we'll be able to further fund programs and activities.


$20,000 towards the design exhibit, construction and installation of museum furnishings, including museum-quality lighting, pedestals, glass/acrylic cases and freestanding walls. 

$3,000 will be used to finish the insulation of the outer walls and to develop a project for a humidity control system. 

$2,400 will help cover the cost of transportation from New York to Uruguay for more than 30 models recently donated by artists who participated in Folding Paper, the Infinite Possibilities of Origami, a groundbreaking exhibition that toured the USA for four years and now will find a permanent home in Uruguay. 

$2,000 for the production of hands-on activities and promotional material.  

What if we raise more than $27,400? That would be awesome, because then we can start programing the next steps:

Outreach community programs (e.g. going to local and regional schools and/or inviting schools to come to the museum.)
An artist residence program: we aim at inviting international origami artists for a period of time to develop an origami project in Colonia. 



 
My story and how the idea took shape
 
For several years I have been working on a project called Origami Art Museum Colonia – Museo del Plegado de Papel y Talleres, aimed at bringing the art of paperfolding (also called origami) to South America.
 
Origami has experienced an unprecedented transformation in the second part of the 21st century. From a traditional children's pastime, it has progressed into a true art form, attracting the minds of scientists, artists and designers. New techniques have developed, leading to a vast range of styles, complexities, and subject matters. Read more about the impact of origami in science here.
Now is the time for an Origami Museum 
Artists have been exhibiting in galleries with great success. But these venues do not address all issues related to the preservation of this art. There is a growing concern about the need to preserve models and documents, and to show the world how origami has evolved. The only answer to these questions is a museum of paperfolding, where people of all walks of life can learn and experience the magic of folding paper and at the same time become a center for conservation and research on the history of paperfolding and its connections with other disciplines.
I began to think about this project in 2008, inspired in part by a visit to an origami exhibition at the Parrish Museum in Southampton, NY. That evening, I was lucky to attend a sneak preview of the arward-winning documentary Between the Folds. Directed by Vanessa Gould, the film illuminated ""the beauty, complexity and powerful duality of origami in the 21st century"" and it was a mind-opener to me. I thought there should be a place where people could go and experience the possibilities of paperfolding. The logical answer was a museum, but there were virtually no museums of that kind in the Western world. Even the word “museum” sounded a little daunting. I was concerned that it would require deep pockets and a large structure. Unless one could manage to make it smaller: a small house may suit the needs of an origami exhibition, along with community outreach programming and workshops.
 
At that moment I was living in the United States. Being a paperfolder for most of my life, I approached OrigamiUSA, the largest community of paperfolders in the world. Over the next few years I developed strong ties with international origami artists. I served on the Board of OrigamiUSA and became the managing editor of The Paper, its print magazine. As I began to gain confidence, I shared my vision with my paperfolder friends. With no exception, everyone encouraged me to follow my dream.

From dream to realityHowever, the main question remained. Where? What would be the ideal location for this kind of venture? I'm a little bit of an idealist... I like to ""plant seeds"". What would be better than a modest place with great potential to grow? Countries like Argentina and Uruguay –where I spent my childhood years –had the ingredients I was looking for: strong tourism, local creativity, inspiring culture and breathtaking landscapes. Time and again, the vision of old memories along the banks of River Plate (Río de la Plata) crossed my mind. And one town in particular, Colonia del Sacramento, in Uruguay, seemed to qualify for my project.  


                     

Located on the Eastern side of Río de la Plata, Colonia is a charming village lost in time. Because of its historical importance, it has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Visitors from all over the world arrive –usually taking a day trip by ferry from Buenos Aires –leaving behind the stress of the bustling city. It's like entering an old postcard. Everything is bright and beautiful, and inviting for a day of relaxation.
 
 
          
The Museum HouseI knew that a museum of paperfolding would not be out of place there: in Colonia, there are several home museums and most are two or three rooms at best!
So off I went to buy a decrepit house in the Historic Quarter, and in 2011 it underwent a restoration to bring it back into livable condition.      In the meantime, I began to acquire origami artwork. The collection began to take shape with established and up and coming artists: Victor Coeurjoly (France/Spain), Kade Chan (Hong Kong), Román Díaz (Uruguay), Tomoko Fuse (Japan), Paul Fresco (USA), Ilan Garibi (Israel), Roberto Gretter (Italy), Isa Klein (Brazil), Alexander Kurth (Germany), Ron Koh (Singapore), Goran Konjevod (USA), Robert Lang (USA), Ekaterina Lukasheva (Russia/USA), Jun Maekawa (Japan), Herman Mariano (Israel), Sejin Park (South Korea/Canada), Ángel Morollón (Spain), Peter Stein (Germany), Annarosa Ventura (Italy), Stephan Weber (Germany), Makoto Yamaguchi (Japan), and many more.
 
         
 

Growing the art collection and historical archivesAdditionally, OrigamiUSA has contributed models created and/or folded by children from around the world, from the traveling exhibitions that OrigamiUSA organize each year under the name of “Origami by Children”.

 
The museum of paperfolding in Colonia will also house two collections of historic significance. One is the Ligia Montoya collection of books, letters and original folded models. The other is the Gershon Legman collection of historical documents and letters from origami pioneers such as Neal Elias (USA), Robert Harbin (South Africa/UK), Gershon Legman (USA/France), David Lister (UK), Ligia Montoya (Argentina), Lillian Oppenheimer (USA), Sam Randlett (USA), George Rhoads (USA), Vicente Solórzano Sagredo (Spain/Argentina), Akira Yoshizawa (Japan), and others. The archives will be open to researchers studying the history of paperfolding. 
 
   
 
In March, 2016, the project will receive a donation from Folding Paper, the Infinite Possibilities of Origami. Meher McArthur, an art historian and curator who brought Folding Paper to life, proposed some time ago to have these pieces sent to Uruguay once the exhibition was over. International Arts & Artists, the non-profit organization that produced the exhibition in the USA, agreed and has been acting as a liaison between the artists donors and the Origami House Colonia project. Among the artists from that collection whose works will find a permanent home in Colonia are: Krystyna and Wojtek Burczyk (Poland), Joel Cooper (USA), Brian Chan (USA), Erik and Martin Demaine (USA), Giang Dinh (Vietnam/USA), Christine Edison (USA), Shuki Kato (USA), Eric Gjerde (USA), Miri Golan (Israel), Tran Trung Hieu (Vietnam), Tom Hull (USA), the late Roy Iwaki (Japan/USA) (through the kindness of his relatives), Paul Jackson (UK/Israel), Ruth Kitagawa (Japan/USA), Daniel Kwan (USA), Robert Lang (USA), Linda Mihara (Japan/USA), Bernie Peyton (USA), Andrea Russo (Italy), Victoria Sedova (Russia), Heinz Strobl (Germany), Nicolas Terry (France), and Polly Verity (UK).
 
       

Risks and Challenges
 
While I was enjoying the sweet feeling of success, my friends interrogated me with down-to-earth questions: ""How are you going to manage the museum?"", they wanted to know. And I said: ""It's going to be a lot of work, but I think it's doable. I settled myself in Colonia.  I live here. I guess it will be like running an atelier or a gallery. I will be in the house/museum doing what I like to do. During the day, the exhibition will be open to the public, and in the evenings and weekends there will be workshops. We'll do local and regional community outreach. The museum will keep an historical archive and will create opportunities for people to work here and do research.""  
It's a big responsibility, I know. And I am grateful to the many friends who have been supporting and believe in the idea. Reaching out to you now for funding creates an even  broader compromise. But I take on the challenge happily because at the end of the day having a little museum of paperfolding is what the tiny child who still lives in me always wanted. I've been living on this wonderful planet for more than half a century (wow!) and I feel as strong as ever and ready to start a journey for which I've been preparing myself for so many years. What I know for sure is that I won't be alone. 

 
What else?I know some of you may think that this is not something that you are going to be able to visit in the short term because of the distance from your home. So why bother contributing? Although it would be great if you could come and visit it (and we hope you'll do one day!), think about this: Your contribution will help this museum become a destination for origami lovers from all over the world. And once this project is up and running, it will also become an example for others to imitate, and more museums of this kind may open in different parts of the world!

Introducción 
OrigamiHouse Colonia es el nombre del museo del plegado del papel que estamos construyendo en Colonia del Sacramento, Uruguay. El objetivo es inaugurarlo hacia septiembre de este año. 
Los fondos recaudados servirán para construir los componentes de la exhibición de acuerdo al proyecto diseñado por un equipo de expertos en museología. Esto incluye el equipamiento (sistema de iluminación, pedestales, paredes divisorias, cajas de vidrio) así como la producción de contenido (narrativa, guión y señalización). 
La comunidad de origami mundial ha mostrado su apoyo decisivo a este proyecto. Hemos venido recibiendo modelos de Rusia, Israel, Singapur, España, Estados Unidos, Brasil, por nombrar unos pocos países. Hay trabajos de creadores eximios y de jóvenes talentosos. 
El proyecto ha recibido la atención de planificadores de museos que han ofrecido su generoso asesoramiento en materia de exhibición e implementación. 
Con la ayuda de todos, este será un museo singular. Todo el equipamiento y el contenido se harán a medida para lograr la calidad buscada. Será un lugar moderno, educativo y divertido para visitar y experimentar con actividades prácticas. 
Este es el momento de poner en práctica todas estas maravillosas ideas y por eso estamos llevando a cabo esta recaudación. 
 
Usted puede ser parte de un gran proyecto! Un proyecto que le permitirá decir a sus nietos: ""¡Yo ayudé a crear uno de los primeros museos de plegado del papel del mundo!""
A continuación explicaremos cómo puede contribuir. ¡No olvide difundir esta campaña entre sus conocidos! 
 
Su generosa donación hará posible...  
 
El objetivo es recaudar 27,400 dólares. Si no se alcanza esta cifra, habrá que adaptarse a un menor prespuesto. Si se recauda más más, podremos avanzar en la programación de actividades. (Los siguientes valores están expresados en dólares norteamericanos)

$3,000  para finalizar el aislamiento de las paredes externas y para proyectar un sistema de control de humedad en los exhibidores. 
$20,000 para el el diseño de la exhibición, construcción e instalación del equipamiento, incluyendo iluminación de alta calidad, pedestales, cajas de vidrio/acrílico, paredes divisiorias. 
$2,400 ayudarán a cubrir los costos de transporte de Nueva York a Uruguay de más de 30 piezas recientemente donadas por artistas que participaron en la exhibición Folding Paper, the Infinite Possibilities of Origami, que viajó por Estados Unidos durante cuatro años y tendrán un destino final en el museo de Uruguay.   
$2,000 Para la producción de material de promoción y actividades prácticas. 

¿Y si logramos recaudar más de 27,400 dólares? Sería genial, pues entonces podremos  comenzar a programar los siguientes pasos: 
 

Proyectos con la comunidad local y regional (por ejemplo ir a escuelas o invitar a los alumnos al museo)
Un programa de residencia de artistas: invitaremos a origamistas internacionales para que pasen un tiempo desarrollando un proyecto de origami en Colonia. 

Mi historia y cómo se gestó esta idea
Concebí este proyecto hace varios años con la idea de desarrollar un museo del plegado del papel en América del Sur: Origami Art Museum Colonia  – Museo del Plegado de Papel y Talleres.
El origami ha experimentado una transformación fenomenal en la segunda mitad del siglo XX. De pasatiempo infantil, se ha convertido en un verdadero arte que atrae el interés de artistas, científicos y diseñadores por igual. Se han desarrollado técnicas, algunas muy complejas que involucran algoritmos matemáticos, y que dieron lugar a diversos estilos, complejidads y temáticas. Para leer más sobre el impacto del origami en las ciencias, pulse aquí.
 
El momento del museo es ahora
Numerosos artistas han exhibido en importantes galerías y museos. Pero estas instancias no contemplan a fondo las cuestiones relativas a la preservación de este arte. Hay una creciente preocupación sobre la necesidad de preservar modelos y documentos, y de mostrar al mundo lo que ya se ha hecho. La respuesta a estas cuestiones es el museo del plegado del papel, donde los visitantes tengan la oportunidad de aprender y experimentar y desde el cual se consolide un centro de conservación e investigación de la historia del plegado del papel y sus conexiones con otras disciplinas.
 
Comencé con la idea del museo en el año 2008, a partir de una exhibición que vi en el Parrish Museum de Southampton, New York. Esa tarde, además, tuve la suerte de ver el anticipo del documental  Between the Folds (que luego recibiría muchos premios). Dirigido por Vanessa Gould, la película iluminaba ""la belleza, complejidad y poderosa dualidad del origami en el siglo XXI"", y eso fue lo que literalmente me abrió la cabeza. Pensé que debería haber un lugar donde la gente pudiera tener una experiencia de este tipo. Lo lógico era un museo, pero no había ninguno en Occidente. Incluso la palabra ""museo"" suena algo temeraria. Pensé que sería necesario muchísimo dinero para armar una gran estructura. A menos que se hiciera algo más pequeño: una casa podría servir para exhibir modelos de origami, a lo que se podrían agregar programas y talleres para la comunidad. 
En ese entonces aún vivía en los Estados Unidos. Como siempre me interesó el origami, me acerqué a  OrigamiUSA, la mayor comunidad de plegadores del mundo. Me conecté con artistas y formé parte del directorio de OrigamiUSA, además de ser actualmente la editora de su revista impresa, The Paper. Mis amigos y colegas me alentaron a seguir con mi sueño. 
De la idea a la realidad
La gran pregunta seguía pendiente. ¿Dónde?  ¿Cuál era el lugar ideal para llevar adelante este emprendimiento? Soy un poco idealista, me gusta ""plantar semillas"". Pensé que la mejor manera de hacerlo sería en un lugar que no tuviese tantos recursos económicos, pero sí, en cambio, un gran potencial para establecer un museo del plegado del papel. Países como la Argentina y el Uruguay, donde pasé mi infancia y juventud, tenían los ingredientes que estaba buscando: un fuerte turismo, creatividad local, cultura vibrante y hermosos paisajes. Una y otra vez volvía el recuerdo de la costa oriental del Río de la Plata. Y una ciudad en particular, Colonia del Sacramento, en Uruguay, me pareció perfecta para este proyecto.         
 
                
Ubicada en la margen oriental del Río de la Plata, Colonia es una ciudad perdida en el tiempo. Debido a su importancia histórica, ha sido declarada Patrimonio Mundial por la UNESCO. Miles de turistas llegan de todas partes del mundo, por lo general tomando un ferry desde Buenos Aires, dejando atrás el stress de la ciudad. Es como entrar en una postal antigua. Todo es brillante y hermoso e invita a descansar. 
                
La casa/museo
En Colonia hay varios museos montados en casas antiguas de dos o tres habitaciones, de modo que un pequeño museo de origami estaría en la escala de lo que la ciudad ofrece. Fue así como en el año 2011 decidí comprar una vieja casona en el Barrio Histórico con la idea de refaccionarla para mi proyecto. 
  
Así también fui coleccionando piezas de origami. Entre ellas, obras de: Victor Coeurjoly (Francia/España), Kade Chan (Hong Kong), Román Díaz (Uruguay), Tomoko Fuse (Japón), Paul Fresco (USA), Ilan Garibi (Israel), Roberto Gretter (Italia), Isa Klein (Brasil), Alexander Kurth (Alemania), Ron Koh (Singapur), Goran Konjevod (USA), Robert Lang (USA), Ekaterina Lukasheva (Rusia/USA), Jun Maekawa (Japón), Herman Mariano (Israel), Sejin Park (Corea del Sur/Canada), Ángel Morollón (España), Peter Stein (Alemania), Annarosa Ventura (Italia), Stephan Weber (Alemania), Makoto Yamaguchi (Japón), y otros..
                
Colección de obras y archivo histórico
OrigamiUSA contribuyó con modelos creados o plegados por niños de diversos países. Las piezas formaron parte de la conocida exhibición itinerante, llamada ""Origami by Children"", que organiza todos los años esta institución. 
El museo de Colonia también alojará dos colecciones de importancia histórica. Una es la colección Ligia Montoya de libros, cartas y plegados originales que perteneció a la mencionada origamista argentina fallecida en 1967. La otra es el archivo de Gershon Legman, de documentos y cartas de pioneros del origami, como Neal Elias (USA), Robert Harbin (Inglaterra), Gershon Legman (USA/Francia), David Lister (UK), Ligia Montoya (Argentina), Lillian Oppenheimer (USA), Sam Randlett (USA), George Rhoads (USA), Vicente Solórzano Sagredo (España/Argentina), Akira Yoshizawa (Japón) y otros. El archivo estará disponible para los investigadores de la historia del plegado del papel. 
          
En marzo de este año, recibiremos medio centenar de obras creadas por algunos de los más reconocidos origamistas del mundo. Estas piezas pertenecen a la exposición itinerante Folding Paper, the Infinite Possibilities of Origami,  que viajó por Estados Unidos durante cuatro años. Su curadora, Meher McArthur, tuvo la generosa idea de proponer que, una vez terminada la exhibición itinerante en Estados Unidos, las piezas viajaran a Uruguay para darles allí una residencia permanente en el museo de Colonia. International Arts & Artists, la organización sin fines de lucro que produjo esta exposición en Estados Unidos, actuó como intermediaria entre los artistas donantes y el proyecto OrigamiHouse. Entre los artistas que aceptaron donar sus trabajos figuran: Krystyna and Wojtek Burczyk (Polonia), Joel Cooper (USA), Brian Chan (USA), Erik and Martin Demaine (USA), Giang Dinh (Vietnam/USA), Christine Edison (USA), Shuki Kato (USA), Eric Gjerde (USA), Miri Golan (Israel), Tran Trung Hieu (Vietnam), Tom Hull (USA), the late Roy Iwaki (Japón/USA) (gracias a la generosa colaboración de parientes), Paul Jackson (Inglaterra/Israel), Ruth Kitagawa (Japón/USA), Daniel Kwan (USA), Robert Lang (USA), Linda Mihara (Japón/USA), Bernie Peyton (USA), Andrea Russo (Italia), Victoria Sedova (Rusia), Heinz Strobl (Alemania), Nicolas Terry (Francia), and Polly Verity (Inglaterra).
 
               
Riesgos y desafíos
Mientras me entusiasmaba cada vez más con mi idea, mis amigos me hacían preguntas críticas: ""¿Y cómo lo vas a manejar?"", querían saber. Mi respuesta fue la siguiente: ""Va a ser mucho trabajo, sin duda. Yo ya estoy establecida en Colonia. Vivo aquí. Pienso que será como llevar adelante un atelier o una galería. Durante el día, la exhibición estará abierta al público y por las tardes y fines de semana habrá talleres. Trabajaremos con la comunidad local y regional. El museo mantendrá un archivo histórico y se crearán oportunidades para hacer investigación"". 
Es una gran responsabilidad. Y estoy agradecida a los amigos que me han apoyado hasta aquí. Ahora, la solicitud de apoyo económico crea un nuevo y mayor compromiso. Pero estoy dispuesta a asumirlo pues, en última instancia, siento que le estoy dando el gusto a la pequeña niña que aún habita en mi, y que siempre soñó con un museo de papel. He vivido en este mundo durante más de medio siglo (uf!) y me siento más fuerte que nunca y lista para emprender esta nueva aventura para la que me preparé durante muchos años. De lo que estoy segura es que no estaré sola. 
 
¿Qué más? 
Algunos pensarán que este museo queda muy lejos y no se justifica aportar dinero para esta causa. Es comprensible, y aunque me gustaría que todos puedan visitarlo algún día (ojalá!), creo que también es importante pensar que su contribución ayudará a que el museo se convierta en un destino ineludible para todos los amantes del origami. Además, un proyecto de esta naturaleza servirá de ejemplo a imitar para que en otras partes del mundo se creen museos de este tipo. 
 
Y ahora: gracias!

</div></div>","CUE INTRODUCTORY THEREMIN MUSIC:
Hi there. My name is Christopher Barton. I'm the director of this year's Haunted Basement, and it is my sincere honor to scare the pants off each and every one of you this year.I have a very special task - to oversee the creation of The Haunted Basement's tenth anniversary. A decade ago, this project was comprised of little more than a few flashlights, a long piece of rope, and a few creative volunteers who saw a lot of raw potential in the building's extremely eerie lower level. Now, it has become abundantly clear that we have created a monster. Each year, a growing army of artists and performers converge to bring all new nightmares to life, tasked with the knowledge that our audience holds us to a unique standard in the world of haunted attractions: We are one part installation art, one part performance art, and one part pee-your-pants slapdamn crazy. In addition to all the chills and screams we've inspired over the past ten years, The Haunted Basement has been influential to the performing arts. Take for example the burgeoning genre of immersive theater. Veteran Haunted Basement director Noah Bremer and Live Action Set created the Ivey Award-winning production Crime and Punishment in The Soap Factory's basement, sharing many of the same artists and techniques developed in The Haunted Basement.  Who knows where we'll creep up next?The evolution of this project over the last decade has been a thrill ride beyond anybody's expectations. Which is why we need this milestone year to pack a bigger bang than ever.

<p><span><b>Hello! We are Natalia and Cristina, two best friends and queer woman of color raised in San Francisco.</b> We launched <i>Still Here </i>in 2013 because we didn’t see  reflection of people like us in the San Francisco Bay Area LGBTQQ arts community. <br/></span></p>
<p><b>Since 2013, <i>Still Here</i> has become a beloved annual performance at the National Queer Arts Festival in San Francisco.</b> In our performances, queer artists who were raised in San Francisco explore themes of love, loss, resilience, the AIDS epidemic, and the meaning of home in a “gay mecca” by presenting original work in front of sold-out audiences. <b>The work is vulnerable, moving, and stunningly real. </b>Check out our past shows on our <a href=""http://vimeo.com/StillHereSF"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Vimeo channel </a>and a review of the 2013 show <a href=""http://msmagazine.com/blog/2013/06/21/growing-up-queer-in-san-francisco-easy-right/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">from Ms. Magazine.</a> </p>
<p><b>In 2016, we will tackle the theme of displacement</b> with a moving cast of artists that re-imagine and reinvent the meaning of home within our rapidly home city of San Francisco. We’ve seen first-hand how rising costs of living and evictions have impacted LGBTQQ artists and caused a widespread diaspora, even for those with deep roots in San Francisco. <br/></p>
<p><b>We need your help to present <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/246677079023874/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Still Here IV: disPLACEment </a>on June 15, 2016 at the African American Arts &amp; Culture Complex! </b>We have 10+ incredible artists and a crew of 5+ people that we want to support. Ticket sales and grants alone aren't enough to pay our artists and crew. As a team of two, most of our work is voluntary, but it’s critical to us that our artists, crew, and others receive generous compensation for their work. <br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>We've created 3 years of<i> Still Here</i> performances without crowdfunding and this year we ask you</b><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""> to support us in bringing our 2016 show to life!</b></p>

Hello! We are Natalia and Cristina, two best friends and queer woman of color raised in San Francisco. We launched Still Here in 2013 because we didn’t see  reflection of people like us in the San Francisco Bay Area LGBTQQ arts community. 
Since 2013, Still Here has become a beloved annual performance at the National Queer Arts Festival in San Francisco. In our performances, queer artists who were raised in San Francisco explore themes of love, loss, resilience, the AIDS epidemic, and the meaning of home in a “gay mecca” by presenting original work in front of sold-out audiences. The work is vulnerable, moving, and stunningly real. Check out our past shows on our Vimeo channel and a review of the 2013 show from Ms. Magazine. 
In 2016, we will tackle the theme of displacement with a moving cast of artists that re-imagine and reinvent the meaning of home within our rapidly home city of San Francisco. We’ve seen first-hand how rising costs of living and evictions have impacted LGBTQQ artists and caused a widespread diaspora, even for those with deep roots in San Francisco. 
We need your help to present Still Here IV: disPLACEment on June 15, 2016 at the African American Arts & Culture Complex! We have 10+ incredible artists and a crew of 5+ people that we want to support. Ticket sales and grants alone aren't enough to pay our artists and crew. As a team of two, most of our work is voluntary, but it’s critical to us that our artists, crew, and others receive generous compensation for their work. 
We've created 3 years of Still Here performances without crowdfunding and this year we ask you to support us in bringing our 2016 show to life!
Why We Hella Need You & What You Get
We need to raise $5,000 to produce this year's show. 
All money raised goes directly to support this year's queer artists and crew. 
We <3 our community and here are some perks for donating:

$25 and up = Social Media Shout-out
$50 = Social Media Shout-out + Digital Thank You Card with Still Here IV Cast Photo
$75 = Social Media Shout-out + Handwritten Thank You Card from the entire cast
$100 = Handwritten Thank You Card  + Acknowledgement in Still Here IV program$200 = Still Here Tote Bag + Handwritten Thank You Card  + Acknowledgement in program 
Still Here's Impact
In three short years  50+ artists have participated in Still Here with over 600 audience members! 
Here's what  Still Here alumni artists are sayin': 
""Still Here artists are the informal historians of our own version of San Francisco.""

""Living in San Francisco would have been filled with so much more despair for the last 4 years without Still Here."" 

""Still Here has given me hope and comfort that we will not be forgotten.""

<p>The Wheel Of Fortune Tarot deck has incorporated the hearts and minds of many tarot card designers and authors I have met over my long career as a tarot card printer and printing manufacturer. </p>
<div> </div>
<p>They have been various people, such as doctors, housewives, card readers and filmmakers who have so many special feelings, unique understanding, passion and love for tarot art. </p>
<p>We have created a strong business relationship and also a close friendship with each other, combining our creative ideas to produce custom tarot deck orders. The biggest highlight of my job is when a customer receives their custom tarot deck and is completely satisfied with every little detail.</p>
<p>The Wheel Of Fortune Tarot deck comes from my dream journey of making my own tarot deck. I have been very passionate about this idea for a long time and I have always dreamed of how it would look. This deck has been inspired by the traditional Rider-Waite tarot deck and consists of 78 beautiful hand-drawn oil paintings for the cards. This is the culmination of an emotional journey for me.</p>
<p>I need to express my appreciation and gratitude to our artist Miss Ganianrong for her beautiful oil paintings which express our ideas of optimism, confidence, courage， and love. She worked diligently for 8 long months from March to October 2018 to hand paint all 78 images. The design is ready and we are prepared for the printing.</p>
<p>The deck is also influenced by my reading of the book""Personal Renewal"", by John William Gardner, Which I also quoted as part of the printing for both of the box designs.  </p>
<p>May I share the quote with you from the book: </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Meaning Of Life </strong></p>
<p>Meaning is not something you stumble across, like the answer to a riddle or the prize in a treasure hunt.</p>
<p>Meaning is something you build into your life.</p>
<p>You build it out of your own past,</p>
<p>out of your affections and loyalties,</p>
<p>out of the experience of humankind as it is passed on to you,</p>
<p>out of your own talent and understanding,</p>
<p>out of the things you believe in,</p>
<p>out of the things and people you love,</p>
<p>out of the values for which you are willing to sacrifice something.</p>
<p>The ingredients are there. You are the only one who can put them together into that unique pattern that will be your life. Let it be a life that has dignity and meaning for you. If it does, then the particular balance of success or failure is of less account.</p>
<p>-""Personal Renewal"", by John William Gardner</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I know nothing great is accomplished alone, so that’s why I continue to need and highly appreciate your support in order to bring this project to life.</p>
<p>At this point, I wish to take this opportunity to thank all of my friends and customers along with my career and share my experience and encouragement to those who want to create their own custom tarot cards and run a business by infusing my ideas into The Wheel of Fortune Tarot Deck.</p>

<h2>Acrylic Warrior</h2>
<p>Mental health for Veterans is an issue that the US has been dealing with for a long time, but it’s affecting more Americans than ever. Veterans today are lacking effective resources and oftentimes take a turn for the worst and never recover.</p>
<p>Christian, the main subject of this project, has experienced combat warfare in Iraq and has seen first hand what the aftermath of war looks like. When returning from war, he was affected from PTSD, and upon trying to recover, found frustration, helplessness, until he began to paint. This therapy was found in an usual place for Christian, but it was the turning point for his recovery. Artwork was a way to express feelings and emotions in a unique way, and since finding success, he has put himself out there to help other Vets treat their PTSD with art.</p>
<p>Mental health is more relevant today than it’s ever been. With the suicide rates at an all-time high, we need to address solutions to help save the people we value most. Military Veterans have risked their lives, and are unable to recover. Therapy is not always easily accessible, and people might be waiting to “snap out of it” for their whole life. Christian will be joined by other Veterans who have first hand experience with PTSD who can relate deeply to the topic, and share knowledge.</p>
<p>We are here to bring light on a major issue, but to encourage anybody who has suffered from PTSD, or Depression, to not lose hope, and find the power within to give new forms of therapy a chance when nothing else works. </p>
<h3>A Message From The Artist</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Christian. Thirteen years ago after returning from Iraq, I found therapy through painting. Art has helped me work through my challenges with PTSD. After my newfound love of art, I became an advocate for mental wellness in the Veteran community. This year, I made a huge breakthrough using the non-profit Give An Hour and am devoted to helping spread the word. </p>
<p>Many Veterans come home from war and have a difficult time adjusting to civilian life. We are expected to shed our anger, guilt and depression as if it were skin and step into a new body. Some adapt and overcome but some aren’t as fortunate. It is estimated that 22 Veterans commit suicide A DAY. Those are only the numbers that go reported. I believe it’s higher than that. It’s never too late. Make the phone call, go for a walk, start saying yes to all and any opportunities. Do ANYTHING but stop fighting. You have so much to offer whether you believe it or not. I could’ve stayed on the couch 13 years ago and closed myself off to the world. I would’ve known exactly how my life would’ve ended. Instead, I made the choice to keep fighting.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Enlist Yourself...</h2>
<p>No, we aren't asking you to sign on any dotted lines (many of us have done that already). By signing up, you are part of a team. A movement that combats Veteran-suicide with peace, love and happiness through creativity. We are seeking $120,000 to fund this project. The budget will cover the film crew, project coordinator, production artist, marketing, public relations, and travel expenses.</p>
<ul>
<li>Project Artist $20,000</li>
<li>Project Manager $10,000</li>
<li>Film Crew $76,000 (Note: They not only produce the documentary, but also handle post production as well, i.e. marketing, website, etc.)</li>
<li>Travel/Shipping Expenses $14,000</li>
</ul>
<p>If we don't meet our goal, we will revisit our plan and discuss cheaper alternatives. We will take what we do raise and still make this campaign happen but on a smaller scale.</p>
<p>Unique perks of this project will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Digital Presale of the Acrylic Warfare documentary</li>
<li>Limited Edition Canvas Giclée (signed and numbered)</li>
<li>Limited Edition 11x17 Posters (signed and numbered)</li>
<li>Campaign T-Shirt</li>
<li>Supporter, Associate &amp; Executive Producer credit opportunities</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>Inspiration is key. Through myself and a different guest speaker in each city, my vision is to inspire others. I'll never forget the night I went to my first art show. I found some of the most beautiful, creepiest, powerful paintings that sparked something inside of me. The next day, I felt like a little kid showing my parents pictures from the show. Art saves. It saved me and it continues to save many others every day. I understand that art isn't the answer for everyone, but my story is living proof that life is still worth fighting for. </p>

<p><strong>“</strong>It’s our memories that make us interesting; stories of amazing journeys, nights out seeing something new, cultural, exciting, provocative, or even life-changing. These were my emotions after seeing Giles Walkers’ <i>The Last Supper </i>at The London Science Museum. I want you to understand those feelings when you come to experience MONSTER.<strong>”</strong> - Ben Oakley.</p>
<p>Giles Walker is no stranger to producing the full on ‘art experience’. Over 30 years ago he joined the guerrilla art group, <i>Mutoid Waste Company</i>. With this collective of artists, he traveled all over Europe living and creating art experiences that are still spoken about with great enthusiasm today. With Giles Walker’s current work, he continues to deliver intense, physical, sculpture. Emotions are acted out in the movement of figures and everyday objects using simple mechanisms. Kinetic sculpture, as with the choreography of dance, or physical theatre, can also strive to find a ‘poetry in motion’ and this has become the main drive behind his work.</p>
<p>Using animatronics, sound, and light to create a tightly synchronized piece of art, MONSTER is sure to provoke a raw emotional response and leave the viewer with an experience they will never forget. </p>
<p>The installation will be set in an atmospheric Georgian Warehouse on the Thames. You will not view this installation passively from afar...you will be in it and immediately surrounded by animatronic figures (some 4.5m tall) as they interact between themselves and with you. Different perspectives will be experienced from this piece of sculpture depending on where you are, and when, allowing the audience a fresh experience each time they visit. </p>
<p><strong>“</strong>Giles Walker is a master sculptor and a genius<strong>”</strong>- Ken Russell, <i>The Times</i> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Giles Walker &amp; the Ben Oakley Gallery have been in pre-production on MONSTER for around 14 months already, there have been numerous studio and location visits, midnight phone calls, the odd pint, emails galore, design drawings, meetings, models made, creative planning and fine-tuning. All this preparation leaves us truly confident that we can deliver a memorable art experience to everyone who visits the MONSTER exhibition. </p>
<p>The same attention to detail has been given in developing some interesting and creative ideas to offer as our exclusive Indiegogo crowdfunding perks/rewards.</p>
<p>Work on the show has already begun. The concept behind the show is pretty much locked down and Giles has already begun fabricating some of the animatronic characters that will play a part in this huge kinetic sculpture. A singer has been found and has begun recording vocals for one of these characters to sing. Dialogue is being written. Trees have been felled and carved for the larger sculptures and our various storage units are beginning to fill up with a collection of materials needed. We are on it.</p>
<p>We have set our campaign target at just £38,000. This is the minimum amount we believe is needed to make this project possible. Half of this amount will pay for the materials required in the build of this installation. Motors, steel, bearings, lighting, digital components, such as the DMX PCB's, cabling, fiberglass, scaffolding, are all essential for the fabrication of this piece. Giles’s many years of experience has taught him how to be imaginative in order to keep costs down (he is originally a scrap artist after all) but, ultimately, the work must be made to a high standard and short cuts can often backfire badly in the world of kinetics! </p>

</div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","“It’s our memories that make us interesting; stories of amazing journeys, nights out seeing something new, cultural, exciting, provocative, or even life-changing. These were my emotions after seeing Giles Walkers’ The Last Supper at The London Science Museum. I want you to understand those feelings when you come to experience MONSTER.” - Ben Oakley.
Giles Walker is no stranger to producing the full on ‘art experience’. Over 30 years ago he joined the guerrilla art group, Mutoid Waste Company. With this collective of artists, he traveled all over Europe living and creating art experiences that are still spoken about with great enthusiasm today. With Giles Walker’s current work, he continues to deliver intense, physical, sculpture. Emotions are acted out in the movement of figures and everyday objects using simple mechanisms. Kinetic sculpture, as with the choreography of dance, or physical theatre, can also strive to find a ‘poetry in motion’ and this has become the main drive behind his work.
Using animatronics, sound, and light to create a tightly synchronized piece of art, MONSTER is sure to provoke a raw emotional response and leave the viewer with an experience they will never forget. 
The installation will be set in an atmospheric Georgian Warehouse on the Thames. You will not view this installation passively from afar...you will be in it and immediately surrounded by animatronic figures (some 4.5m tall) as they interact between themselves and with you. Different perspectives will be experienced from this piece of sculpture depending on where you are, and when, allowing the audience a fresh experience each time they visit. 
“Giles Walker is a master sculptor and a genius”- Ken Russell, The Times 

What We Need & What You Get
Giles Walker & the Ben Oakley Gallery have been in pre-production on MONSTER for around 14 months already, there have been numerous studio and location visits, midnight phone calls, the odd pint, emails galore, design drawings, meetings, models made, creative planning and fine-tuning. All this preparation leaves us truly confident that we can deliver a memorable art experience to everyone who visits the MONSTER exhibition. 
The same attention to detail has been given in developing some interesting and creative ideas to offer as our exclusive Indiegogo crowdfunding perks/rewards.
Work on the show has already begun. The concept behind the show is pretty much locked down and Giles has already begun fabricating some of the animatronic characters that will play a part in this huge kinetic sculpture. A singer has been found and has begun recording vocals for one of these characters to sing. Dialogue is being written. Trees have been felled and carved for the larger sculptures and our various storage units are beginning to fill up with a collection of materials needed. We are on it.
We have set our campaign target at just £38,000. This is the minimum amount we believe is needed to make this project possible. Half of this amount will pay for the materials required in the build of this installation. Motors, steel, bearings, lighting, digital components, such as the DMX PCB's, cabling, fiberglass, scaffolding, are all essential for the fabrication of this piece. Giles’s many years of experience has taught him how to be imaginative in order to keep costs down (he is originally a scrap artist after all) but, ultimately, the work must be made to a high standard and short cuts can often backfire badly in the world of kinetics! 
Most importantly, at this early stage, in order for Giles to continue with the build and stick to the schedule, we need to raise £6,000 so that he can concentrate full time on the essential design & fabrication. This amount will allow him a few months without other distractions and is based on his minimum studio and living costs. 
The Georgian Warehouse where we plan to exhibit the show will cost over £6,000 This is for the 25 days of MONSTER pre-build, technical checks, exhibition days & dismantle.
An additional £4,000 is needed for staffing, production & PR for the next 7 months until installment.

 How do I make sure I get the right size?</b></p><p>A:  We’ll be contacting you to find out your exact size by November 1st (and we’ll even include a sizing chart so you can be sure of getting exactly what you want.)</p><br/><p><b>Q:  Is travel and hotel included in my Thin Air Summit or Thin Air Summit VIP perk?</b></p><p>A:  No, ‘fraid not.  (This is a fundraiser, after all.)  However, the Peppermill Resort Spa Casino was kind enough to arrange these screaming deals for Thin Air Summit folks-- <a href=""https://resweb.passkey.com/Resweb.do?mode=welcome_ei_new&amp;eventID=14206335%20"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Click here</a> or call 800 282 2444 and refer to group code:  <b>CERNV15</b>.  (But, they’re limited in number so quit fooling around and make your reservation RIGHT NOW.)</p><br/><p><b>Q:  What about my lunch with Lance Burton in Las Vegas or Julie McCullough at the Magic Castle in Hollywood?  Are you flying me out?</b></p><p>A:  No.  None of the perks include travel or accommodations.  Isn’t it enough that these cool people are making themselves available for you?  Now you just have to get there to experience the awesomeness.  If that means a crazy road trip where your car breaks down in the middle of nowhere and you have to hitchhike and you get picked up by a Scary Stranger who turns out to be the love of your life and you live happily ever after and never even make it to redeem your perk-- you’re welcome.  If, on the other hand, the Scary Stranger chops you up like salami, you can rest assured that Matt Damon will probably play you in the inevitable movie version that will follow.  (And in the film you probably get rescued at the last minute and still make it to the assigned perk where you meet the celeb who will probably be played by Scarlett Johansson.)</p><br/><p><b>Q: So can I order anything on the menu for lunch or dinner?</b></p><p>A:  Yes, with the exception of booze.  Our non-profit can’t pay for any purchases of alcohol.  (Look on the bright side-- you’ll be the Designated Driver.)</p><br/><p><b>Q:  I’m confused about this Brain Stimulator.  Will it actually make me smarter?</b></p><p>A:  Hard to say.  Kind of depends on how smart you are now.  Would you be interested in some magic beans?

 out the perks on this page that were too weird to mention upfront!LIMITED EDITION SPELLBINDERS GLOW IN THE DARK POSTEROFFICIAL SPELLBINDERS T-SHIRT (Front)OFFICIAL SPELLBINDERS T-SHIRT (Back)SPELLBINDERS COFFEE MUGF.A.Q.Q: When do I get my perks?A: All perks will be sent within 6 - 8 weeks after the campaign ends.Q: Will I get my perks in time to give as Xmas gifts?A:  Maybe.  Our goal is to have every one of them in your hot little hands by Dec. 15th at the latest.Q: What about perks that happen during SPELLBINDERS, or the Thin Air Summit, like private lessons with badass magicians?A: We’ll have your name and perk detailed on our secure servers and confirm them with you before you arrive.Q: What about my tickets to the Gala Show?A: You’ll receive those by mail by Oct. 20, 2015, or, if the gods of technology interfere, we’ll have them for you at the Will Call box-office window at the Pioneer Center on the day of the show.Q: Is my donation tax-deductible?A: Education Renaissance of Nevada Initiative is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.  All donations are tax-deductible to the fullest extent allowed by law.  You should consult with your C.P.A. or tax preparer.  Tax ID: 46-1195169.  (A list of the fair market value of each perk can be requested by e-mail from info@thinairsummit.info.)Q: What about my t-shirt?  How do I make sure I get the right size?A:  We’ll be contacting you to find out your exact size by November 1st (and we’ll even include a sizing chart so you can be sure of getting exactly what you want.)Q:  Is travel and hotel included in my Thin Air Summit or Thin Air Summit VIP perk?A:  No, ‘fraid not.  (This is a fundraiser, after all.)  However, the Peppermill Resort Spa Casino was kind enough to arrange these screaming deals for Thin Air Summit folks-- Click here or call 800 282 2444 and refer to group code:  CERNV15.  (But, they’re limited in number so quit fooling around and make your reservation RIGHT NOW.)Q:  What about my lunch with Lance Burton in Las Vegas or Julie McCullough at the Magic Castle in Hollywood?  Are you flying me out?A:  No.  None of the perks include travel or accommodations.  Isn’t it enough that these cool people are making themselves available for you?  Now you just have to get there to experience the awesomeness.  If that means a crazy road trip where your car breaks down in the middle of nowhere and you have to hitchhike and you get picked up by a Scary Stranger who turns out to be the love of your life and you live happily ever after and never even make it to redeem your perk-- you’re welcome.  If, on the other hand, the Scary Stranger chops you up like salami, you can rest assured that Matt Damon will probably play you in the inevitable movie version that will follow.  (And in the film you probably get rescued at the last minute and still make it to the assigned perk where you meet the celeb who will probably be played by Scarlett Johansson.)Q: So can I order anything on the menu for lunch or dinner?A:  Yes, with the exception of booze.  Our non-profit can’t pay for any purchases of alcohol.  (Look on the bright side-- you’ll be the Designated Driver.)Q:  I’m confused about this Brain Stimulator.  Will it actually make me smarter?A:  Hard to say.  Kind of depends on how smart you are now.  Would you be interested in some magic beans?  Now those babies really work.BRAIN STIMULATOR",5.0,1,"2 Campaigns

By 2014 her illness progressed rapidly and she required around the clock care. As a painter myself, I would care for her in the early morning until the nurses aid would come and take care of her until I got home from work. During the period before her death, exhausted and grieving, I fell two months behind in the rent due to both mine and Caroline’s medical and credit cards bills. By the third month I received an eviction notice. I went to housing court and worked out a payment plan with the landlord. I was paying $3,619.90 rent, plus $895.00 a month to cover the arrears. After selling a painting, I was able to make the payments for the next 8 months, but by April 2015, with medical bills piling up, I fell behind again.<br/><br/>Caroline passed away August 14, 2014. Still grieving, I also have my own medical condition that I have been managing for many years. I have Hepatitis C. My prescription treatment is a 90 day supply of Harvoni which is $94,000. Thankfully, my medical insurance covers 95%, but I’m still required to cover a $3,000 copay and another $1,000 for each following month. With all the medical bills and debts collecting, I began to search for assistance.

Tape is the vehicle which allows me to express myself with color and movement. Often the final top surface is taken down to layers below by sanding and scratching. This is where the character of the painting is built--revealing the intertwining, unwinding textural layers underneath.

Impact Recently, I salvaged an old historic farmhouse (scheduled to be condemned) and completed the restoration to be used to promote local arts. We have the choice of selling this farmhouse to developers moving into the area (tear down for new development) in order to continue my education or keep my dream of helping local artist, finding resources to continue my education elsewhere, such as crowd-funding.                                                       My

Risks
& Challenges 
My pieces have evolved from individual pieces to a number of series showcasing my skills and serving as a voice to my beliefs, concerns, and even the story of my life.  I am currently working on a number of series, two of which are focused on child abuse, primarily molestation. 
It is a difficult approach, as it is too personal and requires a lot of focus and emotional balance.  While I alternate with pieces reflecting my family focus, I really desire to reach those who seem immune to the reality and alarming statistics of children being abused.  I continuously explore various mediums, techniques, and new processes to not only address these issues, but find a visual expression that will attract the eye, in spite of the content. 

               

You Can Help
Not everyone can help financially, but I really appreciate the emotional support and encouragement.  If you would please pass this campaign on to others who not only appreciate the arts, but value education, and have a concern about the social issues of child abuse.  If you need extra help in sharing, Indeigogo has share tools to help spread the word.  www.kennabolesprior.com",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div>Hello everyone!</div>
<div>Thank you for taking the time to read this. My name is Ganga, other wise known as Jasmin. In this lifetime this mind had struggled with depression, anxiety, and confusion on how to express itself in a positive way. What has helped and continues to help me grow is my Yoga practice. Yoga is a science that helped me see a healthier way of living; Healthier for my body, mind, and soul. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>This is why I have chosen to create Yogic children's books. To share this beautiful science and way of living with younger generations so they could perhaps bypass this confusion and live in harmony with all of existence. This coloring book is the first of many to help introduce basic Yogic principles for Love, Self Awareness, Non-Violence, Honesty,etc. In this coloring book children will have the opportunity to learn about Shapes, Colors, Chakras, Asanas (Physical Yoga Postures), and so much more.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div></div>Why do we need $1000 right now? The Printing of Shapes and Chakras cost $1000 and we're hoping to have them printed and ready to be sold at upcoming Benefits. Every penny earned will be going towards this. Shapes and Chakras Coloring Book will be printed!</div><div><br/></div><div>
<br/><div>Helping publish this coloring book will not only help benefit the children but will help raise funds and awareness for <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Puresa Humanitarian. Puresa is helping rescue girls and women from brothels and giving them a place to stay. Why are funds needed desperately right now? </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> Puresa owns a piece of land that they intend to build a permanent home for the girls. The Indian Government is threatening to re-claim the land if building does not commence by this summer. They </span>already have grants from the Indian Ministry of Education to run an elementary through college level school under that permanent structure.This is a huge deal as the girls are shunned from society and not afforded an education, even though they were so brutally victimized. They of course will have emotional, spiritual and health counseling, skills training for jobs, sustainable gardening and more.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>So they need our HELP.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>A portion of the funds made by the coloring book will also be going towards my son's (River) schooling tuition. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Every penny is used for the spreading of Education, Awareness, and Love</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>These coloring books will be sold on Etsy, in Yoga studios, and at Seeds Of Service upcoming Benefit for Puresa.

In this lifetime this mind had struggled with depression, anxiety, and confusion on how to express itself in a positive way. What has helped and continues to help me grow is my Yoga practice. Yoga is a science that helped me see a healthier way of living; Healthier for my body, mind, and soul. 

This is why I have chosen to create Yogic children's books. To share this beautiful science and way of living with younger generations so they could perhaps bypass this confusion and live in harmony with all of existence. This coloring book is the first of many to help introduce basic Yogic principles for Love, Self Awareness, Non-Violence, Honesty,etc. In this coloring book children will have the opportunity to learn about Shapes, Colors, Chakras, Asanas (Physical Yoga Postures), and so much more.

Why do we need $1000 right now? The Printing of Shapes and Chakras cost $1000 and we're hoping to have them printed and ready to be sold at upcoming Benefits. Every penny earned will be going towards this. Shapes and Chakras Coloring Book will be printed!
Helping publish this coloring book will not only help benefit the children but will help raise funds and awareness for Puresa Humanitarian. Puresa is helping rescue girls and women from brothels and giving them a place to stay. Why are funds needed desperately right now?  Puresa owns a piece of land that they intend to build a permanent home for the girls. The Indian Government is threatening to re-claim the land if building does not commence by this summer. They already have grants from the Indian Ministry of Education to run an elementary through college level school under that permanent structure.This is a huge deal as the girls are shunned from society and not afforded an education, even though they were so brutally victimized. They of course will have emotional, spiritual and health counseling, skills training for jobs, sustainable gardening and more.

So they need our HELP.

A portion of the funds made by the coloring book will also be going towards my son's (River) schooling tuition. 

Every penny is used for the spreading of Education, Awareness, and Love


These coloring books will be sold on Etsy, in Yoga studios, and at Seeds Of Service upcoming Benefit for Puresa. If anyone has interest in providing another space to sell this creation or any questions regarding any of the information shared here  please feel free to contact me at Jasmin.Barrios@gmail.com

Feel free to share this on any social media you like.

Thank you for taking the time to read this <3

May all living beings benefit from this creation, especially those suffering.

Love, Serve, Remember

<p>In 2012, the installation of his art studios in French Catalonia marked his return to the Mediterranean. His work, mainly dedicated to sculpture and painting, also explores writing and architecture. Its line of force and main themes are spirituality and the place of Man facing Time. </p>
<p>Since the 1980s, Guy Ferrer has developed an international career highlighted by exhibitions in numerous museums and galleries.</p>

<p>In addition to this, the festival hosted 3 days of music and education, facilitated by our workshop space, which was running for three days entirely off renewable energy.</p>
<p>The event from all aspects except financially was a major success. We ended up with quite a large deficit so we thought that we would reach out to our amazing community to help recuperate some of the loss. </p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h2><strong>Hello! </strong></h2><p>After a great show at the Saatchi Gallery in March with the UK Crafts Council, my latest thing I've made (燒烤設置 (Barbecue setting)) has been invited to be part of some prestigious events including:</p><ul>
<li> The 2019 British Ceramics Biennial  </li>
<li>Parcours Ceramique Carougeois 2019 Biennial in Geneva with Taste Contemporary.</li>
<li>A residency at the Shanghai Academy of Fine Art where I'll be making more of this                                 stuff</li>
<li>The Yangtze River Delta Cultural Industry Exhibition (Shanghai)</li>
</ul><p>I'm super excited about these opportunities, but unfortunately getting 燒烤設置 to these places and in front of key people is expensive! So, I need your help. Become a part of this global project with me right from the outset. </p><p>Check out the perks and packages to the right for each donation amount (click on them for more info and what they include), and help 燒烤設置 (Barbecue setting) travel around the world!</p><p>Thank you!!!!!!!!!</p><h2><strong>What am I going to do with the money?</strong></h2><p>2 very important things:</p><ul>
<li>With your generous contributions, these funds will help me to <strong>cover the basic logistics</strong> of travel and shipping as well as <strong>pay my collaborators</strong> who will be helping me to film and edit the commercial and infomercial aspects of the marketing campaign I am developing.</li>
<li>Your help will also assist in a very important endeavor:<strong> arts funding</strong>. I've applied to some funding bodies but they require match funding for applications to be successful. If I can raise just <strong>10% of the overall costs</strong>, this will greatly increase my chances of getting major arts funding. This happening will not only make it possible to create more work and experiment with new ideas, it will further my career and help me to get more support for projects like this in the future!</li>
</ul><h2><strong>What’s 燒烤設置 all about?</strong></h2><p>Well, 燒烤設置, is a collection of American backyard BBQ items made out of blue and white porcelain. It's a reflection on the historic relationship between the East and West which was at first based on the trade of Chinese porcelain, and has been credited for initiating the current global economy. 燒烤設置 highlights the way the tables are turning right now between China and the West by packaging an aspect of Western culture that can be seen as both low-brow and the soul of America (the backyard BBQ), for a hypothetical Chinese client. Originally inspired by misprints on historic Chinese export porcelain, the pieces included in BBQ all have poorly google-translated silly backyard BBQ sayings on them like ""you don't make friends with salad"", ""I don't get drunk I get awesome"", and ""my grill, my rules"". 燒烤設置 explores themes relating to miscommunications in design, the commoditization of culture, China’s soft power initiatives, and it’s new position as a leader in the global consumer market.To learn more, and see more pics,  visit: <a href=""https://www.maryomalley.co.uk/barbecue-setting"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.maryomalley.co.uk/barbecue-setting</a></p><p>Alongside these exciting exhibition opportunities, I am also developing a brand new satirical marketing campaign for 燒烤設置 which will include a commercial, informercial, and merchandise (similar to what you'll receive when you donate)! I don't know about you, but I am particularly excited about this, because it's a brand new way to explore ways of creating and collaborating with other people as well as expanding on what 燒烤設置 has to say.

 The 2019 British Ceramics Biennial  
Parcours Ceramique Carougeois 2019 Biennial in Geneva with Taste Contemporary.
A residency at the Shanghai Academy of Fine Art where I'll be making more of this                                 stuff
The Yangtze River Delta Cultural Industry Exhibition (Shanghai)
I'm super excited about these opportunities, but unfortunately getting 燒烤設置 to these places and in front of key people is expensive! So, I need your help. Become a part of this global project with me right from the outset. Check out the perks and packages to the right for each donation amount (click on them for more info and what they include), and help 燒烤設置 (Barbecue setting) travel around the world!Thank you!!!!!!!!!What am I going to do with the money?2 very important things:
With your generous contributions, these funds will help me to cover the basic logistics of travel and shipping as well as pay my collaborators who will be helping me to film and edit the commercial and infomercial aspects of the marketing campaign I am developing.
Your help will also assist in a very important endeavor: arts funding. I've applied to some funding bodies but they require match funding for applications to be successful. If I can raise just 10% of the overall costs, this will greatly increase my chances of getting major arts funding. This happening will not only make it possible to create more work and experiment with new ideas, it will further my career and help me to get more support for projects like this in the future!
What’s 燒烤設置 all about?Well, 燒烤設置, is a collection of American backyard BBQ items made out of blue and white porcelain. It's a reflection on the historic relationship between the East and West which was at first based on the trade of Chinese porcelain, and has been credited for initiating the current global economy. 燒烤設置 highlights the way the tables are turning right now between China and the West by packaging an aspect of Western culture that can be seen as both low-brow and the soul of America (the backyard BBQ), for a hypothetical Chinese client. Originally inspired by misprints on historic Chinese export porcelain, the pieces included in BBQ all have poorly google-translated silly backyard BBQ sayings on them like ""you don't make friends with salad"", ""I don't get drunk I get awesome"", and ""my grill, my rules"". 燒烤設置 explores themes relating to miscommunications in design, the commoditization of culture, China’s soft power initiatives, and it’s new position as a leader in the global consumer market.To learn more, and see more pics,  visit: https://www.maryomalley.co.uk/barbecue-settingAlongside these exciting exhibition opportunities, I am also developing a brand new satirical marketing campaign for 燒烤設置 which will include a commercial, informercial, and merchandise (similar to what you'll receive when you donate)! I don't know about you, but I am particularly excited about this, because it's a brand new way to explore ways of creating and collaborating with other people as well as expanding on what 燒烤設置 has to say. Also, it will all be hilarious.  Last but not least, who am I you ask?For those of you who don’t know me, here’s a little bit about who I am and things I’ve done:Link to CVI am a professional ceramic artist and having been working full time as such for the past 7 years.

When he is excited, his nose will turn into a heart shape, and heart beams begin pouring out from his nose. He has a childhood sweetheart -- <strong>Sakuchu Sakurapi,</strong> which is a lovely pinky piggy.</p><p>The idea behind <strong>the name “Kimochu'' comes from certain etymology</strong>. In Japanese, uh, let's call them ""action films''. You'll often hear it in the dialogue of these films. KimoCHU sounds very similar to “KimoCHI”, which in Japanese means ""feeling good""（気持ちいい）. Moreover, the word ""CHU"" represents the sound of ""KISS"" in Japanese. ; In Chinese, “Chu'' means “chocolate”, it also sounds like ""Pig"". Anyways, for our purposes, we design the chocolate theme for our first Kimochu figure series. </p><p>The guiding concept design behind KIMOCHU is that when we taste chocolate, we tend to have a very good feeling overcome us -- much like falling in love. So yes, to answer your question: <strong>Chocolate Kimochus make you feel like falling in LOVE!</strong></p><p>讓我們來介紹一下《甜蜜西遊》的人氣角色——別名奇摩豬的朱八戒！奇摩豬是糖三藏的二弟子，是從天界掉下來的玫瑰酒心朱古力化成而成。當他情緒高漲的時候，奇摩豬的鼻子能變成心型發射出愛心光波！奇摩豬還有一個熱戀中的女友——<strong>櫻花豬朱小花</strong>。</p><p>那麼，<strong>為什麼他會叫KIMOCHU(奇摩豬)呢</strong>？在日文中，「気持ちいい(KIMOCHI）」有著輕鬆、舒服的意思，同時「CHU」在日本是接吻時的發出的形聲詞； 在漢語中，豬八戒的「豬」又和朱古力的「朱」同音。所有文字元素加在一起就變成奇摩豬 KIMOCHU啦！</p><p>正因為奇摩豬的名字中有KISS的意思，加上他那心型的鼻子，奇摩豬的一切都會讓你聯想愛，所以<strong>奇摩豬同時也是代表著「愛」的角色！</strong></p><p> </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What is in Your Perk?</h2><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>你的禮物裡有什麼？</strong></p><p> </p><p>We aimed to produce high-quality design products.

There are 6+1(+6) different designs in total and they will be launched as a blind box. In other words, you will know which Kimochu you have got only after you open your box! Each box will come <strong>with a birth certificate</strong> so it will be a series of art toys that are worth collecting. </p><p>生產高品質的設計是我們最重要目標。 在這個項目中，我們將製作<strong>12cm的Kimochu奇摩豬潮流手辦</strong>。 總共將有6 + 1（+6）個不同的設計，它們將作為盲盒啟動。 換句話說，只有打開包裝盒，您才能知道擁有哪個Kimochu手辦！ 而每個盒子都會<strong>附有出生證明</strong>，因此它是一系列值得收集的收藏品。</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1606653102/juzeoturorfvdzehunqa.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Each certificate have it unique birth number<br/>每盒模型裡都有一張獨一出生編號的證書</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1612113072/tneoxxm1muuohz5l48th.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">The figures average height is 12cm<br/>每盒模型裡都有一只平均12CM的奇摩豬 朱古力系列 潮流玩具手辦</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1611769061/posfhmnnrqg4vivybnxf.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">KIMOCHU X INDIEGOGO<br/>Exclusive LTD Edition</h2><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZBmoIcXbak8?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><div> </div><p style=""text-align: center;"">Kindor Sakura INDIEGOGO Exclusive Edition only can get it in this limited period.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Kindor Sakura INDIEGOGO 獨家版都只能在這段期間有限預訂</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1606653462/fhmbngqzqrtkczoepfjm.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">MORE AMOUNT FUNDED, MORE FIGURES WILL BE UNLOCKED &amp; SELECTABLE!</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">眾籌總數愈多，被解鎖及可選擇的造型更多！</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1611769254/guputhbyqj3vhevqgwd9.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Perk Choices</h2><p style=""text-align: center;"">禮物選擇</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">There are many choices of Perk and up to <strong>72% discount for the INDIEGOGO preorder</strong>.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">這裡有很多不同預訂選項，這次預訂最高可獲贈<strong>高達72%的優惠</strong>。</p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1612233085/ti6klb5mvbpueqmmhid8.jpg"" src=""""/></h2><h2 style=""text-align: center;""> </h2><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Others and Add-on</h2><p style=""text-align: center;"">其他選項 及 附加禮物</p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1608689755/hqvecz389yf0cbxkbn2p.png"" src=""""/></p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">

And there is an Exclusive Limited Edition SAKURA (100pcs) for INDIEGOGO backers!這是《 甜蜜西遊》(JOURNEY TO THE SWEET) 的設計團隊。 現在，我們正在製作已成功眾籌的ART TOY - KIMOCHU 奇摩豬朱古力系列潮玩手辦！首輪6只的可愛的朱古力系列小豬已經成功眾籌，並快將製作完成推出。 因此，我們想在 INDIEGOGO 推出之前再進行一次眾籌和預訂。我們為預訂的支持者提供最高72%折扣優惠，同時也需要你幫助把朱古力系列餘下的6只造型眾籌解鎖；為答謝支持，推出了INDIEGOGO獨家限量版SAKURA（100件）！  Concept of KIMOCHU the CHOCOPI奇摩豬的設計概念  Kimochu.G.Chocopi is the famous character from “Journey to the Sweet (JTS)”, He is Master Candy’s second disciple, the monster of rose alcohol-filled chocolate. When he is excited, his nose will turn into a heart shape, and heart beams begin pouring out from his nose. He has a childhood sweetheart -- Sakuchu Sakurapi, which is a lovely pinky piggy.The idea behind the name “Kimochu'' comes from certain etymology. In Japanese, uh, let's call them ""action films''. You'll often hear it in the dialogue of these films. KimoCHU sounds very similar to “KimoCHI”, which in Japanese means ""feeling good""（気持ちいい）. Moreover, the word ""CHU"" represents the sound of ""KISS"" in Japanese. ; In Chinese, “Chu'' means “chocolate”, it also sounds like ""Pig"". Anyways, for our purposes, we design the chocolate theme for our first Kimochu figure series. The guiding concept design behind KIMOCHU is that when we taste chocolate, we tend to have a very good feeling overcome us -- much like falling in love. So yes, to answer your question: Chocolate Kimochus make you feel like falling in LOVE!讓我們來介紹一下《甜蜜西遊》的人氣角色——別名奇摩豬的朱八戒！奇摩豬是糖三藏的二弟子，是從天界掉下來的玫瑰酒心朱古力化成而成。當他情緒高漲的時候，奇摩豬的鼻子能變成心型發射出愛心光波！奇摩豬還有一個熱戀中的女友——櫻花豬朱小花。那麼，為什麼他會叫KIMOCHU(奇摩豬)呢？在日文中，「気持ちいい(KIMOCHI）」有著輕鬆、舒服的意思，同時「CHU」在日本是接吻時的發出的形聲詞； 在漢語中，豬八戒的「豬」又和朱古力的「朱」同音。所有文字元素加在一起就變成奇摩豬 KIMOCHU啦！正因為奇摩豬的名字中有KISS的意思，加上他那心型的鼻子，奇摩豬的一切都會讓你聯想愛，所以奇摩豬同時也是代表著「愛」的角色！ What is in Your Perk?你的禮物裡有什麼？ We aimed to produce high-quality design products. In this project, we are going to produce 12cm figures of Kimochu, one of the characters from JTS. There are 6+1(+6) different designs in total and they will be launched as a blind box. In other words, you will know which Kimochu you have got only after you open your box! Each box will come with a birth certificate so it will be a series of art toys that are worth collecting. 生產高品質的設計是我們最重要目標。 在這個項目中，我們將製作12cm的Kimochu奇摩豬潮流手辦。 總共將有6 + 1（+6）個不同的設計，它們將作為盲盒啟動。 換句話說，只有打開包裝盒，您才能知道擁有哪個Kimochu手辦！ 而每個盒子都會附有出生證明，因此它是一系列值得收集的收藏品。Each certificate have it unique birth number每盒模型裡都有一張獨一出生編號的證書The figures average height is 12cm每盒模型裡都有一只平均12CM的奇摩豬 朱古力系列 潮流玩具手辦KIMOCHU X INDIEGOGOExclusive LTD Edition Kindor Sakura INDIEGOGO Exclusive Edition only can get it in this limited period.Kindor Sakura INDIEGOGO 獨家版都只能在這段期間有限預訂MORE AMOUNT FUNDED, MORE FIGURES WILL BE UNLOCKED & SELECTABLE!眾籌總數愈多，被解鎖及可選擇的造型更多！ Perk Choices禮物選擇There are many choices of Perk and up to 72% discount for the INDIEGOGO preorder.這裡有很多不同預訂選項，這次預訂最高可獲贈高達72%的優惠。 Others and Add-on其他選項 及 附加禮物

<h3>Drips Cafe &amp; Art Bar</h3>
<p>Hi! My name is Jess and I have an idea. Big news there, this is a crowdfunding site, everyone's got an idea. Mine is a little more locally focused. I am from the Binghamton, NY area, and while we have a thriving art scene of galleries, we seem to be lacking in studio space. I have always wished I was still able to access all of the supplies and tools I was able to use in school, so I thought ""Why not make a place like that for everyone?"" Thus enters Drips! </p>
<p>This campaign is to raise the funds necessary to open Drips Cafe &amp; Art Bar at it's bare minimum start up cost. This money would go toward a physical location to set up shop and some basic equipment to get us started. Our mission is to change lives through art and hopefully create a lasting home base for artists and creatives across the Southern Tier. Through your help and our vision, I know we can make and maintain an atmosphere of creative excellence.</p>
<p>Contributing to this campaign would not only help me achieve a personal dream of mine, but also open up access to many brilliant creative minds who would otherwise have nowhere to express their creativity.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The following is a break down of where we plan to use every cent of the money we hope to raise here. Being open with our backers is important to us. We want you to feel confident that your donations will be going to a worthy cause.</p>
<p>We are hoping to raise $15,000. While this may seem substantial, this is just the tip of the iceberg. In order to get our base of operations up and running, we will first need a location! I've found a very promising location for a grand total of $20,000 a year. This would be an ideal price point for us to start with, and a large portion of funds raised would go to a down payment for the space. We would have a small coffee bar, a supply shop, and plenty of space for tables, chairs, easels, etc. The coffee bar would be the second focus of the funds from this campaign. For professional cafe equipment, we will need a minimum of $6500. This will pay for An industrial coffee brewer ($1000), a point of sale system ($1500), a refrigerator/ freezer unit ($1000), a water filtration system ($1000), an espresso machine ($1000), and an industrial coffee grinder ($1000). These prices are estimates based on my research. If we can find these items for less money, any overage will go straight to stocking up on beans, cups, pumps, storage, and other necessities. I believe in full transparency, so I intend to keep an up to date log of all funds going out and coming in for interested backers.</p>
<p>If we don't make it to our goal, any funds we receive will be donated to arts education at a local high school. If we do make it to our goal I hope to host many community fundraising events to support the arts in our schools.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I have put my whole heart into this project. I spent over a year honing and thinking and brainstorming. I asked questions, I took criticism, I listened to what you had to say. I think I can say with confidence that this is something our area would greatly benefit from not only in the short term but also in the long run as well. I know there are other spots around town that offer creative space and art classes, but there's nothing really available to the lower income community who can't afford to invest in multiple classes or a large amount of supplies. I was one such individual. My dream is to open a studio where people from all walks of life can access their creative minds. I want someone to come in, pay $5, $10, $20 and have the creative outlet of their dreams. My goal is to have equipment available for rent (printing presses, easels, throwing wheels, etc. These items are currently hard to access for the general public. We want to help those who are doing such a wonderful job beautifying Binghamton.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There is always the risk when opening any small business that it will fail. I have put a lot of time into researching ways to combat that risk. I am self taught in social media marketing strategies from my previous work, I am learning new and exciting business strategies every day, and I have a network of creative friends willing to help get this project off the ground. With community support and financial backers, I believe with my research, drive, and passion will make this venture a success. But you can't get anywhere without taking that first step and I would be honored if you would take that step with me.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We are accepting any donations of unwanted art supplies, crafting materials, tables and chairs to keep our start up costs low. I am also putting together some fundraising ideas that require the help of local artists, so if you are interested in contributing your own artwork to the cause, please reach out to us at Drips.art.bar@gmail.com</p>
<p>And of course like, share, and talk us up! We can't wait to get started with you!</p>

Are you looking to get away from the fast-paced world of today and make the most of ‘me’ time? Do you think you have an untapped creative side waiting to come out? My name is Sharlene and I believe that it is never too late to learn a new skill and enjoy a new experience. Over the last 2 years, I have taken my passion for watercolors to the next level by producing commissioned work and conducting workshops. Now, I want to bring my workshop into the comfort of your own home where you can learn at your leisure. I will give you all the instructions you need through my online class, and if you choose to, I’ll provide the same high-quality supplies which help me create my art.For me, watercoloring has become an escape from the outside world and I believe that by undertaking my course, you too can enjoy your own escape and embrace your creative side.I look forward to welcoming you to my world as we both explore the magic of watercolors together.​ The course will offer something for everyone, regardless of your artistic experience. Split into three 2 hour videos (6 hours in total), my online workshops cover everything from basic painting skills to complex watercolour techniques. In addition to this, I will focus on teaching you the RIGHT procedures and style so you will be equipped to apply your newly found skills to new challenges, and explore your own watercolour pathway. You will see immediate return on your efforts, as you apply your hands on learning experience as you create your own piece in the beginners class. As you progress through each workshop, we will continue to build on your skills and techniques. The easy to follow, intuitive workshops will be structured into:  Part 1 - Beginner (Paint a simple dessert)An introduction to the basics of watercoloring. Starting with basic sketching and watercolor techniques to water consistency such as toning and shading. I will also show you how to identify colors and match them along with how to add detail using brush strokes.Part 2 - Intermediate  (Paint a main course)The intermediate level will help you with refining your painting skills whilst tackling some more complex techniques. With this session, you will build on the basics you learned in Part  1 and apply them to a more difficult piece of art. Part 3 - Advanced (Create a food menu + Calligraphy)With the advanced level, you will learn the more difficult and more technical skills of watercoloring. I will show you how to put the ‘wow’ factor into your paintings. Once completed, you'll have all the techniques and skills required to paint a complex design and create your own piece of art.   
Basic sketching (simple shapes to form 3D Models)
Watercolor techniques (WET-DRY Techniques, Gradated, Variegated, Flat wash, Reduce Pigment, Erase, Edging by scrubbing)
Water consistency - Toning and Shading
Apply color theory to paintings
Mix colors from various pigments
Advanced brush strokes technique for details - e.g stain effect for crumbs, flat wash for smooth surfaces 
Making it (food) POP! realism (3D) with shadow and light
Personalising your work with Calligraphy - e.g postcards, bookmarks, greeting cards, recipe book, journaling
  One of the biggest challenges a student would face as a beginner would be choosing the right supplies from the hundreds of options out there. I’ve taken this unnecessary stress out of the process by providing them for you! My experience over the years has allowed me to test out many different types of brushes, paint, pens and paper, and from this I have gathered the best supplies out there suited for any beginner and included it in the kit so you don’t have to worry about it!

<h3> </h3>
<p>$3,420 will also cover the campaign's production &amp; perks, material costs, and to give a little bit of support to the creative team that so graciously volunteered to help out!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The yo-yo is already designed as you may well know – it just needs the funds to do <strong>the biggest batch yet</strong>. Kentaro Kimura of Turning Point took on this collaboration and graciously designed the CAD file and manufactured the yo-yo! Also, Paul Yath from Crucial manufactured the first prototype to get the project started - my gratitude goes out to him as well!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The remaining amount will enable me to continue to produce <strong>high-quality yo-yo performances</strong> (and who knows, perhaps more performance-based yo-yos as well!) that can make <i>thousands </i>(and perhaps <i>millions</i>!) of <u>people smile</u>. And we all know that <strong>a genuine smile is good for the soul</strong>, and that which is good for the soul is good for the body and for the mind, for our overall health and well-being (not to get all philosophical on you or anything). Not only that –smiles are <i>positively contagious</i>!</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>I need $550 to produce each of the 4 colors.</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The plan is to produce 10 Chameleon per the four colors.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>If I don't reach my goal</strong>, the funds will still go towards manufacturing as many yo-yos and/or art pieces you've pre-ordered, and you will still get what you paid for. However, I need to get 10 Chameleon orders per color in order to make the large run possible! If I don't get 10 orders per color,<strong> I may have to ask you to switch to another color, so please share this with your friends so that we can get all of the colors for your enjoyment!</strong></p>
