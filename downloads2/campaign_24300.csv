</div></div>","Our Story
Innervation Dance Cooperative (IDC) has been busy formatting two original contemporary ballets, Everyman and Gods, Monsters, and Heroes, based
 on classic literature, to tour to Chicago-area schools in 2012. 






We based Everyman on the medieval morality play by the same name, a story of redemption, performing good deeds and living a life that 
matters. We set the tale to timeless, stirring music by Led Zeppelin. Gods, Monsters, and Heroes, set to contemporary music, tells
 various stories from Greek mythology, and educators can choose the 
myths they would like to see presented, customizing the performance 
for their students’ ages and studies. A study guide has been created for
 each show in an effort to enhance the students' and teachers' 
experience, presenting lessons about dance in general, about the 
literary works, the ballets themselves, and about how all of these 
elements relate to other subject areas. We had some wonderful

<div>My name is Alena Adler and I am a senior majoring in Theater and Performance  minoring in Arts Management at SUNY Purchase.  For my senior project, I will be directed by Jesse Penber in <em>A Woman Alone, </em>a one woman show written by Dario Fo and Franca Rame.</div>
<div>Last year, I started studying Vaudeville and found myself interested in Solo performances. I had made it a bucketlist goal to do a One Woman show, when a teacher suggested I do one for a senior project. After reading a variety of different One Woman Shows, i found Dario Fo, and after reading another one of his plays, Waking up, and appreciateing his humor, I knew I had found something I was interested in. <em>A Woman Alon</em>e was the second play I read and after laughing aloud at the humor and irony in the piece, I remember thinking 'I could see myself playing this character.' I kept it in the back of my mind and read a few more Dario Fo and Franca Rame One woman shows and decided <em>AWA</em> was the best choice.It is an intricate piece with more layers than an onion. It is a tragicomedy, meaning it is filled with both tragic and humourous elements. It was written in Italian in 1977, being performed that year in Italy. The english translation was written in 1981 and performed in 1982.</div>
<div>It is about Maria, a prisoner in her own home, using farce to push her forward. She tries to continue living life as normally as possible while juggling an abusive husband, a younger lover, a sexually deprived caller, a peeping tom and a perverted brother-in-law.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> This is the most important show I've ever done, so along with putting as much possible time into it, I'd also like the the set to be perfect. If I had more time (aka if I wan't a college student) I would spend my own money on props and the set, but I'm currently without a job and thus, money. I want to show how much everyone has put into this show. On that note, It would mean the world to me for any kind of support. Even $5 could help us get one of our 5 doors or a window.</div>

<h2><strong>Who We Are</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Conception</strong></p>
<p>In 2010, an adventurous band of merry thespians, social entrepreneurs, fiscally prudent sorts and other adventurers, set out to create a new theater that would eventually become Serendipity Playhouse. This brainchild was born to change the World! (Or at least a 10 square mile segment of it in SW Washington.) Serendipity Players is committed to opening ourselves, our stage, our technical shop, and our classrooms to all people who want to participate, and who bring diverse backgrounds to enrich the process. In doing so, we have created a playhouse which illuminates all members in our community. We foster great plays, community interaction, and good fun while encouraging individuals with different agendas to tell their stories in new and healing ways.</p>
<p><strong>                             ~ Serendipity Playhouse ~ </strong></p>
<p><strong>                 Where Great Theater Includes Everybody!</strong></p>
<p>Serendipity Players started this journey by producing “Sylvia” by A. R. Gurney in the Minnehaha Grange, during the hottest week of August in 2011. Encouraged by the success of our unknown theater company’s first work, we set out to find a home with air conditioning! We finally found Serendipity Playhouse in January of this year.</p>
<p><strong>Birth – 2 Years</strong></p>
<p>Since opening the Playhouse, we’ve produced two local playwrights and two internationally acclaimed playwrights to great reviews. We have learned a lot about the “behind the scenes” work that goes into producing great theater. Our audiences are growing, and we are bringing new people to the wonder of theater.</p>
<p>Now, at the dawn of our second year, we have learned our efforts to configure our barrier-free stage, facilities, and seating have come up short. Whenever you’re facing unforeseen stumbling blocks, the first thing to do is to gather all the information you can about the trouble. Here’s what has surprised our playhouse: in qualifying for a grant to complete the final cosmetic restoration on the exterior of our historical downtown space, a building inspection determined we must fine-tune some of the modifications we had already made to the interior of our theater.</p>
<p>To comply with these requests – regardless of continued eligibility for the grant – we must tweak changes to stage lighting, re-configure some of the seating, and meet other code alterations that seem minor, but are necessary to do.</p>
<p><strong>The Future</strong></p>
<p>Resilience will get us through this, but we’re going to need help.  We are wondering if you would pledge or donate any small amount you feel is appropriate to help the theater meet the improvement deadlines and continue with our important mission.  This money will translate into ensuring that barrier-free theater in the arts and culture of our town becomes part of the fabric to a vibrant and flourishing Vancouver. </p>
<p>We are deeply appreciative for your past participation and support in helping launch our unique addition to quality performing arts in the region.  Putting this unexpected hurdle behind us will mark an important turning point for the continued excellence that is Serendipity Players.</p>
<h2><strong>The Impact</strong></h2>
<p>This is it. The big chance. The step up. How often do you get the chance to be a part of a new adventure from the beginning (or close to the beginning.) You'll be able to look at Serendipity Playhouse as not just a place where you come and see great theater, you'll be able to say, “I'm part of the reason this is here.” We're currently rehearsing our next show, we have the 2013 season laid out, and we've started making plans for 2014. If you help us, we'll be here for years to come. We've only started to scratch the surface of what we can do at Serendipity Playhouse. With your help, things will only get better.</p>
<p>We're trying to set a new standard for theater in SW Washington. We're hoping that future includes you as an active member of the Serendipity family.</p>
<p>It’s amazing, thrilling, terrifying – and the board of Serendipity is ready for our baby to grow up and take the leap. But we need your help.</p>
<p>Every donation made to this campaign will help us all realize our goal of maintaining a permanent venue.  It will help to continue to have great theater right here, in our community, without having to cross the bridge to the “big city.” </p>
<p><strong>What We Need</strong></p>
<p>Only 40 to 60 percent of a non-profit theater's budget comes from the box office.  Our founders, Board of Trustees, Donors from the community and theater lovers like you provide the additional necessary funding to keep the keep the productions excellent and informed by diverse perspectives. Because of this, we need your help to raise the following funds:</p>
<p>$2,500 for air flow adjustments<br/> $1,500 for permits<br/> $1,500 for lighting upgrades<br/> $1,500 for access by wheelchairs<br/>$1,000 to adjust stadium seating arrangement to meet code</p>
<p>We have secured a promise of matching funds from one of our regular donors for all contributions received through this campaign - your gift will be doubled! Serendipity Players is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, so the portion of your donation that doesn't pay for a perk is tax deductible.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Every little bit helps, but if you can't spare the cash, there are other things you can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Donate professional skills that would allow us to complete the work free of labor costs.</li>
<li>Help get the word out and make some noise about our campaign.</li>
<li>Indiegogo has share tools that you can use on Facebook, Twitter and your other favorite social media outlets!</li>
</ul>
<p>             Spread the word, spread the word, spread the word!</p>
<p>“Thank you!” from all of us at Serendipity Players – Sandra Geary, President; Tony Broom, Artistic Director; the acting Board of Trustees: John Chiappetta, Vice President; Cecelia Harper, Secretary; David Crain, Development Director; Bob Pitman, Historian.</p>

We are deeply appreciative for your past participation and support in helping launch our unique addition to quality performing arts in the region.  Putting this unexpected hurdle behind us will mark an important turning point for the continued excellence that is Serendipity Players.
The Impact
This is it. The big chance. The step up. How often do you get the chance to be a part of a new adventure from the beginning (or close to the beginning.) You'll be able to look at Serendipity Playhouse as not just a place where you come and see great theater, you'll be able to say, “I'm part of the reason this is here.” We're currently rehearsing our next show, we have the 2013 season laid out, and we've started making plans for 2014. If you help us, we'll be here for years to come. We've only started to scratch the surface of what we can do at Serendipity Playhouse. With your help, things will only get better.
We're trying to set a new standard for theater in SW Washington. We're hoping that future includes you as an active member of the Serendipity family.
It’s amazing, thrilling, terrifying – and the board of Serendipity is ready for our baby to grow up and take the leap. But we need your help.
Every donation made to this campaign will help us all realize our goal of maintaining a permanent venue.  It will help to continue to have great theater right here, in our community, without having to cross the bridge to the “big city.” 
What We Need
Only 40 to 60 percent of a non-profit theater's budget comes from the box office.  Our founders, Board of Trustees, Donors from the community and theater lovers like you provide the additional necessary funding to keep the keep the productions excellent and informed by diverse perspectives. Because of this, we need your help to raise the following funds:
$2,500 for air flow adjustments $1,500 for permits $1,500 for lighting upgrades $1,500 for access by wheelchairs$1,000 to adjust stadium seating arrangement to meet code
We have secured a promise of matching funds from one of our regular donors for all contributions received through this campaign - your gift will be doubled! Serendipity Players is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, so the portion of your donation that doesn't pay for a perk is tax deductible.
Other Ways You Can Help
Every little bit helps, but if you can't spare the cash, there are other things you can do:

Donate professional skills that would allow us to complete the work free of labor costs.
Help get the word out and make some noise about our campaign.
Indiegogo has share tools that you can use on Facebook, Twitter and your other favorite social media outlets!

             Spread the word, spread the word, spread the word!
“Thank you!” from all of us at Serendipity Players – Sandra Geary, President; Tony Broom, Artistic Director; the acting Board of Trustees: John Chiappetta, Vice President; Cecelia Harper, Secretary; David Crain, Development Director; Bob Pitman, Historian.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are drama students at Syracuse University, putting on an independent production of Jane Martin's, Keely and Du. This show <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">is a volatile drama about abortion. Du, a right to life activist, and Keely, a pregnant rape victim she is confining, transcend their circumstances and the ideological issues that separate them. Keely and Du is a mind probing issue play with a gripping human face. Who is accountable? What is the extent of individual freedom? What are a rape victim's rights? What is a Christian's realities of procreation? Their passionate stories exist on the extreme edge of everyday reality.</span></p>

Hello,

My name is Hannah. I am 19 yeas old and an aspiring actress. More than that, I am an aspiring performer. I hope to one day be able to inspire and capture the hearts of an audience the way that I have been inspired and made to fall in love with the art of acting. As you may well know, the competition for aspiring actors to get into prestigious drama schools is very high with thousands of people desperately wanting to get in every year and going to audition after audition. Through my hard work and determination I have been privileged enough to be accepted into one of the best and highly respected drama schools in the country, The Oxford School of Drama. I have been accepted to do a Foundation Degree in Acting. The tuition fees for this course costs over £7,000 and with no government funding available I am left to raise this myself. £7,000 is an unthinkably large amount of money however, with help from my supportive family, out of this I now just need to raise the last £500 to keep my honorable place at The Oxford School of Drama. The course covers the acting methods and techniques of Stanislavski, Chekhov and Hagen, as well as classes in movement, voice, singing, stage fighting, film and television work and professional development. I can compare the opportunities I will get from this to nothing I have ever experienced in my life. I have a strong passion for performance. I relish the versatility it demands of the performer and the challenge of engaging and connecting with the viewer. I began my journey with the Stagecoach Theatre Arts Company, being introduced to singing, dancing and acting and I have recently completed a B-TEC Extended Diploma in Performing Arts. In this, I have had the opportunity to further develop my skills in these disciplines and I completed the course proudly achieving final grades of DMM. During this time, I have had amazing opportunities in the industry such as being a background artist in a feature film, How I Live Now, and also popular ITV programmes Lewis and Endeavour. I've had chance to meet and discuss with known professionals within the industry on a live set. I have also performed in venues such as Oxford New Theatre, Pegasus Theatre, Chipping Norton Theatre and the Wycombe Swan. I spend my spare time seeking supporting artist opportunities, gaining modelling experience, maintaining my fitness and holding down a part time job to finance my ambitions. I can not express enough the life changing opportunities I will gain from the training I will receive at The Oxford School of Drama.I appreciate that £500 is still a very large amount of money and not many people have money to spare but even the smallest amount will be a blessing to me! The funds will go only towards my drama school education and nothing else. If you are able to support me and contribute whatever way you can towards my future, I, in return, will keep you in it! I will write you a personal thank you letter to help show my appreciation of your kindness and invite you to any shows/showcases I may have. I will let you know of my progress (and success!) of being a drama student and let you know of my journey afterwards, which will hopefully continue to grow as I pursue it.Even if you are unable to contribute I would still appreciate a simple share of this page to let others know and I will be just as thankful! Above this text is a simple link to share my page!Thank you so much for taking the time to read this. I am not usually one to ask for money, however I will do anything I can to help further myself in the industry and in my own personal training. Every little helps, however small or large! I am extremely greatful to all.Thank you, Hannah Barron",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hello! My name is Chris Lovell, and I am a sophomore at the College of Saint Rose. I've had a passion for theatre since 6th Grade. Last year I was able to start a project that was a dream of mine for a couple of years. The drama department at Saint Rose helped produce the first run of the Saint Rose Theatre Festival. It was very successful, filling every seat in the house in its one-night-only run. </p>
<p>As soon as the house emptied after the performance, I knew that I wanted to see the festival into a second year. This year the festival will run for an entire weekend, and for that to happen successfully, we need your help.</p>
<h3>What we need your help for...</h3>
<p>To make theatre accessible to everyone, the festival is free to all attendees. Having a multi-performance festival with free admission makes things difficult financially. So, to successfully produce the festival this year, we will need to expand our budget. Some of the things we need funding for include:</p>
<p><br/> - New walkie-talkie system for communication between backstage, house management, and lights/sound<br/> - Advertisement and publicity materials (including print and online media advertisements)<br/> - Printing and binding of scripts and programs<br/> - Lighting and sound effects equipment<br/> - Paint to revamp the theatre</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>College is the prime time for everyone to enjoy new things and make some self discoveries. Not many students have the chance to see their writings come to life on stage. This festival does exactly that, It also gives theatre goers a view into new and interesting ideas in theatre. </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I understand if you aren't able to contribute financially to the theatre festival. But you can still help make the festival even more successful than it was last year. You can help spread the news about the festival and this campaign, and follow the festival on multiple social media platforms. </p>

<h3>What is The Three Leaches? The Three Leaches is a small local theatre company, dedicated to bringing quality, exciting and edgy theatre to the masses for an affordable price.</h3>
<h3>
<strong>We wholeheartedly believe great theatre should focus first and foremost on the quality and depth of the story and acting, which is why a budget of $1000 is set for every show we produce. </strong><br/><br/> We forgo ornate sets, complicated costumes, and glamorous divas to give you the best experience we can. <br/> This is theatre - raw. </h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>So why do we need your generous donations? The Three Leaches wants to do something new- we are always looking for ways to expand and challenge ourselves! We want to take two fantastic shows- one classic and one modern take on that classic- and produce them side by side as one show/ project instead of two.  This takes twice the resources to accomplish, which is why we need your help!</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>The shows: </h3>
<h3>The Seagull by Anton Chekhov- This classic dramatises the romantic and artistic conflicts between four characters: the ingenue Nina, the fading actress Irina Arkadina, her son the playwrite Konstantin Tréplev, and the famous middlebrow story writer Trigorin.  This classic will be directed by the incredibly talented Bryce Alexander. </h3>
<h3>The Nina Variations by Steven Dietz, A Denver Playwright- Dietz imagines 42 different scenarios between Chekhov’s Nina and Treplev, the young actress and playwright from The Seagull. What happens when these two classic characters are trapped in a room together with no way out? This will be directed by The Three Leaches Artistic Director, Melissa Leach. </h3>
<h3>Where does our money go? Even if we don't meet our total goal, every little bit helps.  All of the money from this fundraiser will go towards the rights, the rental price, the costumes, the set, and the props for these two shows. It is money well spent! Denver's theatre scene is growing and you can help the arts thrive!</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>What's in it for you? Good question.  First of all, you get to help fund two fantastic shows. We also want to thank you all for donating, so depending on how much you donate, we will show our love for you with: Shout outs in our programs, free tickets to see the shows, a free drink at the show, a sneak peek at the rehearsal process, and finally, a dinner with the owners of The Three Leaches before a performance.</h3>

As a collective we seek to break down walls, kick open doors, and smash through glass ceilings.</p><p>In our newest creation we look away from Shakespeare and decided to go a little wild, Oscar Wilde. This one is going to be a monster and we cannot do this without our Monster fans.</p><p><strong> How to help</strong></p><p>After spending a year working with our collective of artists on script exploration and ensemble building we wanted to bring the monster fans some bubbly and bright in order to share the love we have been feeling. As we create this show as a true collective we hope to bring you the most amazing product possible, but that is not free. As you have probably guessed there is no way to produce theater for only $2,000 in NYC. As a show of dedication to you we are only asking for a small portion of our budget. The largest amount is coming from our ""collective"" pocket. Not a company but from the artists themselves. We believe in the work that we do so we only ask for what we need and we pay for the rest.</p><p>But we only get it if you lend a hand. Think of it as a Valentines Gift to the monster that you love. For as little as $10 you can get one of our awesome thank you gifts; blog mentions, signed scripts, and tickets to the show are only the tip of the iceberg. As we create everything about this show as a collective, for our top donation, we will work your name into a song in the show and record that song for you as a special thank you. We will insert a new name for each top level contribution and I dare you to make us work as many names into the song as possible.</p><p><strong>The Impact</strong></p><p>Independent theater is a breeding ground for new artists and innovation. In New York, indie theater is being forced to compromise or being forced out due to high rents, astronomical production rental costs, and exorbitant marketing prices. In order for a theater to take risks, they need support from all areas. “Crowd funding” support is how we know that you believe in innovation, creativity, and opportunity. We believe strongly in those areas as well.</p><p> Inserting songs into classical work is not a new concept, especially into classical scripts. In this show we want to honor a connection that has been often over looked. John Gambril Nicholson was a poet and contemporary of Wilde and inspired at the very least the title of this treasured play by his work <u>Love in Earnest</u> (published three years before<i> Importance</i>). Very little is left connecting the two except the company they kept and the dual lives they led as gay men. The idea of ""bunburying"" was Wilde, the fondness for the name Earnest was Nicholson, but the trails of living a double life was felt by both men as well as many others that were forced to hide their love from English society. We want to connect the art of both men in this amazing play and these beautiful (and often hilarious) poems, songs and ballads.

</div></div>","Short Summary
Twin Alchemy Collective is dedicated to creating bold, innovative new theatre.  We approach topics we wish to explore with a genuine spirit of curiosity.   We aren't afraid to take risks in experimenting with new forms--specifically, the best form to tell the story, whether that be something no one has ever done before, or that we've just never tried before.  We seek to create visceral performances, and to engage with our audience more immediately and intimately.  Above all, we strive to work with great precision and intentionality to craft every detail and moment with great care and specificity.  


                                               
                                    

Here's what some people had to say about our first production, Little Mother:

The Impact
 Why should you consider donating even if you don't live in Austin?
If these productions are something you'd like to see, but you don't live in Austin, by all means share this campaign with a theatre company in your city whom you feel would be a good fit.  If you're a theatre director outside of Austin, and would like to read scripts, or discuss logistics, please let's get in touch! (katiegreen444@gmail.com)
I've had my plays produced in Indiana, Chicago, and New York, and would love to continue to push my work out into the rest of the world.  I'm especially interested in working with theatre persons (or non-theatre, but interested persons) in adapting the text-based adventure project for specific communities.

<p>The Artist's Laboratory Theatre is developing ""Found Fayetteville"", a show for Last Night, the New Year's Eve celebration at the square in downtown Fayetteville. The show is comprised of ""found"" text, and is a multi-media, reader's theatre, a ""giddy and gutsy"" experience- all happening in a giant sheet fort! Our venue for the evening will be Kathy P.

<h3>Hi there!!!!!</h3>
<p>     My name is Greg Blackmon and I'm a dancer with the Eisenhower Dance Ensemble in Detroit, MI. I moved here from New York after training at The Ailey School and Dance Theatre of Harlem over the span of 2 years, while dancing with three professional companies and a student collective. I was offered a job with EDE in June, during which time I was at a point of financial instability. I took the job because I liked the repertory we learned in the audition as well as some of the things I saw when I researched the company. I also figured that I could spend the time that I had in Michigan saving up the money to get back to New York and dance with one of the many companies there that I aspire to be a part of. However, living in Michigan isn't what I thought it would be, as well as working with this company. It's a great company but I don't think it's right for me. I haven't been able to save up the money to get back because most of my money goes towards bills and incendentals like groceries and dance clothes. The little bit that I have has to be divided between paying my taxes and paying my student loans back starting in June.</p>
<p>     This campaign is not just a matter of me getting back to a place where the work is more suitable for me. It's also a matter of me getting home. I didn't know what a real home was until I got to New York and got to be around other artists like myself. And the energy there is easily the most vibrant, inspiring thing in the world. I was raised in a place that wasn't very inspiring, where I felt alienated most of the time because I knew I didn't belong there. I belong in New York. My home. I learned so much while I was there and I need to get back to the peace that I found there.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The ""Hard"" Part:</h3>
<p>     In order to rent a room or sublet an apartment, pay for workshops/audition fees, and pay for transportation, I'm only trying to raise between $2500 and $3000 dollars. The rest I can take care of once I find a job. I plan on asking my old managers at Aeropostale if they can re-hire me for the summer, as well as applying to a wide array of restaurants in the city. I'm determined to get back home. </p>
<p>     I know that I won't have trouble finding a job in dance or anywhere else once I get there. I'm experienced, determined, intelligent, quick and very good with people. I will do everything in my power to stay.</p>
<p>     In the unfortunate event that I do not reach my goal by the time I'm hoping to, I  still plan to do as many workshops and auditions as I can afford. I still plan to find at least one other job to provide myself with a significant enough income. And I definitely plan to keep writing as many people as I can to ask for help because this is one of those times when I really need it. </p>
<p>     This project will be of such great impact not just to me but to those who help. You get to smile with pride saying that you helped someone's dreams come true. You would be the reason for someone being whole again and growing tremendously as a person through all the things they would learn. There's so much that New York has to offer, some of which I've experienced, but most of which I haven't yet. In such a short amount of time there, I managed to dance with three professional companies, two student companies, spend time at two of the best dance schools in the world, and network and connect with artists who are untouchable to most people. Imagine what I can do by setting my roots in the home I didn't know until I got there. Imagine the beauty that I and my colleagues could create and thrust upon this world.</p>
<p>Imagine.</p>

     I know that I won't have trouble finding a job in dance or anywhere else once I get there. I'm experienced, determined, intelligent, quick and very good with people. I will do everything in my power to stay.
     In the unfortunate event that I do not reach my goal by the time I'm hoping to, I  still plan to do as many workshops and auditions as I can afford. I still plan to find at least one other job to provide myself with a significant enough income. And I definitely plan to keep writing as many people as I can to ask for help because this is one of those times when I really need it. 
     This project will be of such great impact not just to me but to those who help. You get to smile with pride saying that you helped someone's dreams come true. You would be the reason for someone being whole again and growing tremendously as a person through all the things they would learn. There's so much that New York has to offer, some of which I've experienced, but most of which I haven't yet. In such a short amount of time there, I managed to dance with three professional companies, two student companies, spend time at two of the best dance schools in the world, and network and connect with artists who are untouchable to most people. Imagine what I can do by setting my roots in the home I didn't know until I got there. Imagine the beauty that I and my colleagues could create and thrust upon this world.
Imagine.


 


 
If for any reason you can't contribute to my campaign PLEASE do help spread the word about it. I'm determined to make this work!!! I'd greatly appreciate it. And I greatly appreciate you.

<p>They ask, ""Help Us Bring Regifting Lions to life.""</p>
<p><strong>ReGifting Lions</strong> gives a voice to people who are traumatized and have to create a new life after the trauma. Often viewed as raw and uncomfortable, survivors of cancer, addiction and other traumas learn to hide their discomfort for the benefit of others.   Addressing the issues of survivors in a unique way, <strong>Regifting Lions</strong> highlights the shame of illness and the desire to hide it, the urgency to connect with others, and the ability of survivors to recreate life after the trauma.  By addressing these issues in an artistic outlet, we hope to shed light on a problem of societal acceptance - no one wants to talk about cancer and chronic illness, or death of an overdose or suicidal depression, but they happen.  <strong>Regifting</strong> <strong>Lions</strong> explores the people left behind - these unique people's desire to live -– the willingness to unearth and heal traumatic events and the ability to reshape their lives.</p>
<p><em>From Lynn, Catalina, and Toni, “We are all well-known artists in our own right.  We are also intimately connected with the trials of trauma.   Lynn is a cancer survivor.  Toni is a 20 year sober alcoholic.  Catalina is connected to people in recovery.  We are combining our artistic voices, our histories, and our experiences in recovery and survivorship, to produce an intimate look at the healing process.  A healing process that involves life, laughter, and love.”</em></p>

<p>""What the play gave to the conversation was realism, an emotional component....You can talk about something all you want, but people don’t understand until they also feel and experience it.""</p>
<p>We are asking for your help to fund the Experiments.</p>
<p>Our $1,500 goal will be devoted entirely to paying our artists: playwrights, actors, directors and designers. </p>

<h3><u>The what now...?</u></h3>
<p>Our mission at Made it Ma! is to bring contemporary, significant plays from the global arena, to the stage in Vancouver. Our aim is to keep theatre alive and fresh for the modern generation by presenting an experience from the moment our audience members enter the building, complete with an entertaining show that breaks the rules and entices the viewer.</p>
<p>We have enlisted theatre veteran, Aaron Craven (Artistic Director - Mitch and Murray Productions) to helm our first project, as Director. The play, 'Bull' by award-winning playwright Mike Bartlett, is a savage, acid-tongued new work from one of the UK's most exciting and inventive young writers. Razor sharp and blackly comic, Bull is a savage and insightful play about office politics or playground bullying, depending which side you're on. Genuinely thrilling, daring and inventive, acclaimed playwright Bartlett probes the dark side of the modern workplace. He has been dubbed 'The British Mamet' for his deliberate, pointed and darkly humorous writing.'</p>
<p>'There is no relief, no escape. This is a riveting and really uncomfortable 55 minutes.' Susannah Clapp - The Guardian</p>
<p>'It is queasily entertaining... Keeps its adrenaline level high and, at the very end, raises it off the charts.' Ben Brantley - The New York Times</p>
<p>'...this play’s message couldn’t feel more urgent.' Alice Seville - Time Out London</p>
<p>With a great cast, a killer story and a favourite venue, this production promises to be vicious, hilarious and best of all, unapologetic in its playfulness and purpose. But we need your help - and Vancouver needs this show to awaken it from it's wintry January slumber. Read on friends!</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3><u>Something for something!</u></h3>
<p>To get the show off its feet, we need to raise $2,000 - $3,000. It's not a huge mountain of funds, but a necessary injection to make the show a possibility. This amount will cover the rental of the theatre, royalties and technical fees.</p>
<p>Perks for donating include listings in our playbill and social media, complimentary tickets to opening night performance and reception, ad space in our playbills and much more! Business operators and those wanting to raise awareness of a specific cause can receive promotion across all of our materials, where it will be viewed by thousands of people.</p>
<p>Should we raise the necessary funding, we will commence production of 'Bull' and will open January 24th at Studio 1398 on Granville Island, Vancouver. And what a show it will be! Lively, dark and witty, audiences are in for a treat.</p>

</h3> <p>Bonjour!</p>
<p>My name is Manon Gage, and I am French-American actress, currently in my third year of training at the Juilliard School in New York City. This year, I am producing Molière's Tartuffe, one of my all-time favorite plays, as a student-initiated project. Eleven acting students and four historical performance musicians here at Juilliard have been collaborating since August 2016 with faculty members Mark Olsen (director), Michelle DiBucci (music director), and Darryl Quinton (choreographer) to bring this great classic to life in December 2016.</p>
<p>Molière, working under the tolerant protection of Louis XIV, wrote successful Renaissance satires with great panache. These plays are easily accessible to modern audiences due to their focus on universal human foibles which transcend the world of 17th century France. Perhaps his best work, Tartuffe is hysterically funny and gorgeously poetic, as well as being bitingly anti-establishment (it is a play that his close contemporary, Shakespeare, would have been prevented from staging in Puritan London.) Openly mocking the clergy or, more specifically the “pharisees” operating under the guise of religion to advance their own often sinister agendas, Tartuffe is as applicable today across religions, nations and communities as it was in 1664.<br/><br/>We are extremely thankful to have received a $500 grant from the Juilliard School, which covers 
honorariums to our director, stage manager and musicians. However, that 
still leaves us needing to pay for $1600 worth of production elements, namely set pieces, 
props, costumes, and lights rented from the Juilliard School's 
production department. We need your help! Please give whatever you can 
to help us put on this wonderful play. If you cannot contribute, you can
 still help us by getting the word out 
about our campaign! Please use Indiegogo's share tools or old-fashioned 
word of mouth.<br/></p>

<h3>THE BEGINNING: </h3>
<p>I grew up in the entertainment world and at just 3 years old I knew that I wanted to be a performer. I picked up guitar at age 11 and began writing my own music by age 12. During my freshman year of high school I auditioned for the school's musical and was awarded the leading role. Ever since that moment I knew I had to be on Broadway. Musical Theatre is my passion and calling. I could not imagine doing anything else. </p>
<p>I went to college for a couple years and was trained in different acting styles, as well as really honing in on my musical craft. Now, I have returned to Los Angeles to focus on pursuing my dreams of performing and my next step towards that dream is LA's Next Great Stage Star. </p>
<h3>THE COMPETITION:</h3>
<p>I auditioned for the competition on December 10th and receive rave reviews by the directors, producers, and choreographers. I was accepted into the competition and I could not be more excited or blessed by this opportunity. In the competition I will be judged by a live audience and an overall nearly two dozen member panel of LA musical theatre’s most dynamic creatives forces. If I win I will be awarded representation by a talent agent as well as a cash prize. The competition will also expose me to other producers and agents (Walt Disney Parks, The Center Theatre Group, Musical Theatre West, and more). An average of 50% of contestants get signed to a talent agent through this competition. Not to mention, I will be learning and growing in a way that only a competition and exposure like this can help me. </p>
<h3>HOW YOU CAN HELP: </h3>
<p>I need $600 to participate in the competition. This will cover my vocal lessons and other amenities for the competition. It will all be worth it when I complete this competition and win or lose, I will gain a ton of experience, knowledge, and talent representation. </p>
<h3>THANK YOU!</h3>
<p>Thank you so much for your consideration and I hope you find it in your heart to invest in a dream that is on it's way to becoming reality. God bless you! </p>

<h3>We are three creative individuals who have just put together our own companies, Lilian and Paul, who you can see in the attached video, are the dancers that form Dance Company Callous Affection, based in Brighton and they have both just graduated Cornwall university in a BA (hons) in Dance and Performance. Vicki, of Raxeira Productions is a freelance videographer and director, she has known Lilian since childhood and worked with both of them on multiple occasions, most notably she shot, directed and edited the 'Nym - et Moi' video seen here. Vicki is based in Scotland travels between Edinburgh and London in pursuit of creative endeavours frequently.</h3>
<p>Our Campaign is basically just to raise funds for travel and wardrobe to give our video another edge, we believe this video will be both beautiful and entertaining and would love to share our creative expression with the world. It would mean so much to us to know that we have the support of people who wish to continue the ever diminishing funding for arts in this country. Helping us reach this very small amount will give a whole new element to this video in the way that we can really portray our Japanese influence through wardrobe and makeup and we can shoot in our ideal location, in a studio in Scotland.</p>
<p>Our funding breakdown is very simple, we need around £75 per person for a travel allowance, there are three of us, we need a wardrobe budget of £150 - £200, a food budget and if we have anything left over we would like to hire some new lenses.</p>
<p>We are a little bit weird and wonderful, Lillian and Paul have such an amazing choreography portfolio and Vicki specialises visuals, mainly natural light and dark aesthetics. We are so excited to be shooting in Scotland where we have access to rope swings and a large space to create whatever we want! </p>
<p>At a time where we define ourselves as part of a mass, most of them some what evil - 'Before I move off' focusses in on the individual, and explores the intricacy of human interaction. It reminds us of why it is we should still celebrate the beauty behind the wickedness that seems to surround us at this time.</p>
<p>Please don't hesitate to have a look at our portfolios to which we will provide links and have a look at our previous collaboration, this video was done with no budget and we feel it is a strong representation of our style but would love to have the opportunity to push our boundaries further than before!</p>
<p>If you cant contribute but like the sound of our project please share us through anyway you can, facebook, instagram, even email some folks you think might like the sound of it, if you'd like to see a great example of innovative dance and full creative freedom on all sides of the board spread the word!</p>

<blockquote>East
Texas meets New York as UNSPEAKABLE PRODUCTIONS is proud to present TALL PINES
LODGE as part of the 20th annual New York International Fringe Festival - FringeNYC. <br/><br/>Texas writer JD Graves has constructed a taut psychological drama in
TALL PINES LODGE, directed by Joshua Hill with a live score.
First produced at the FronteraFest Long Fringe 2006 where it was called “the
most disgusting thing I’ve ever seen,” TALL PINES LODGE makes its New York
premiere with an all new cast.  <br/><br/>Set deep in the Piney Woods of East Texas, TALL PINES LODGE is a
claustrophobic pulp thriller that shatters the notion of honor among thieves.
The play opens with JOE ED (Conor Andrew Hall) and BOOKER (Ryan Scoble),
bankrobbers awaiting their cut of the score and the arrival of the mysterious
MR. VALENTINE (Brian Detlefts). When Booker’s brother, the psychopathic COTTON
(Titus Tompkins), arrives they get more than they bargained for in the form of
DAISY (Jehan O. Young), Cotton’s impromptu hostage. </blockquote>
<p><i>Tall Pines Lodge</i> brings together long time collaborators Joshua Hill and JD Graves for the first time in over a decade to mount the New York premiere of Graves's pulp thriller.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary 
East
Texas meets New York as UNSPEAKABLE PRODUCTIONS is proud to present TALL PINES
LODGE as part of the 20th annual New York International Fringe Festival - FringeNYC. Texas writer JD Graves has constructed a taut psychological drama in
TALL PINES LODGE, directed by Joshua Hill with a live score.
First produced at the FronteraFest Long Fringe 2006 where it was called “the
most disgusting thing I’ve ever seen,” TALL PINES LODGE makes its New York
premiere with an all new cast.  Set deep in the Piney Woods of East Texas, TALL PINES LODGE is a
claustrophobic pulp thriller that shatters the notion of honor among thieves.
The play opens with JOE ED (Conor Andrew Hall) and BOOKER (Ryan Scoble),
bankrobbers awaiting their cut of the score and the arrival of the mysterious
MR. VALENTINE (Brian Detlefts). When Booker’s brother, the psychopathic COTTON
(Titus Tompkins), arrives they get more than they bargained for in the form of
DAISY (Jehan O. Young), Cotton’s impromptu hostage. 
Tall Pines Lodge brings together long time collaborators Joshua Hill and JD Graves for the first time in over a decade to mount the New York premiere of Graves's pulp thriller.

Meet the Cast

Conor Andrew Hall (Joe Ed) was born and
raised in Michigan and received a BFA from Central Michigan University. Tall Pines Lodge

Pains (Under St. Mark’s Theater), Wet
Glitter (IRT), R&J: Star Cross’d

Nags. Titus holds an MFA in Acting from American Conservatory Theatre in San Francsico. He is a proud member of Actor's Equity.

Rep, JACK, Ars Nova and countless esteemed basements with working pipes and a
black curtain. She has also performed internationally in the Setkani/Encounter Festival
in the Czech Republic and appeared in the German Shakespeare Festival. Jehan
holds an MFA in Acting from Columbia University School of the Arts and a BA
from Spelman College.

well as directing, choreographing, and performing with the New York City Gay
Men’s Chorus. He received his Bachelor’s in Vocal Performances from New York
University (Musical Theatre) and is currently a Master’s Candidate in

What We Need & What You Get So where is the money going?



Marketing and AdvertisingIt's tough to get butts in seats, and it's not cheap, either. We have 250 seats to sell and we can't rely on friends and family to take them all. Our budget accounts for both direct and online advertising and marketing, which will allow us to spread the word to the largest possible audience. 


Artist CompensationEveryone deserves to be paid for their hard work. While we are an Actor's Equity Showcase, we believe that you shouldn't have to be part of a Union to be paid for your time. Every artist working on our show will receive payment for their time and effort. No one is going to get rich from doing a Fringe show, but we can make sure they can buy groceries!


Props and CostumesSometimes it's the little things that make a show. Dynamite comes in small packages and it ain't cheap! We have to clothe five actors and purchase or create dozens of props for the show, and the little things add up.


SundriesExpect the unexpected and you'll still be surprised half the time. Every day we get closer to opening there's another unexpected, unforeseen thing that crops up. Whether it is unexpected fees or having to replace a broken set piece, anything and everything can happen and we need to be prepared.

It doesn't seem like a lot, but we're currently producing the show ourselves on a shoestring budget. With rehearsal space paid for, every little bit helps and all of this money is going directly into the production of the play.
What do you get?
You get to help create art!
Not enough?
We believe that every perk should be personal, so we're taking the time to make sure that (almost) every perk is unique, personal and heartfelt. We want you to know how much you mean to us.
    The Impact Your contributions are going to make a significant impacts on our production. From helping create an immersive atmosphere on the stage to allowing our actors to feed themselves, your donations are going to be seen and felt by everyone involved.
By giving to our campaign you are not only supporting each and every one of us as artists -- a profession which we have all sacrificed deeply for -- but you are promoting a little bit of Texas in the Big Apple.
    Risks & Challenges Producing art is never a safe endeavor, and a FringeNYC show is no exception. Beyond the normal challenges of creating a piece of theatre, we are limited by the rules and restrictions of the festival. 
With your help we hope to overcome these challenges to present a tight, psychological drama that will leave the audience on the edge of their seats.
    Other Ways You Can Help If you can't contribute, we totally understand! But we'd still love your help. Buy an advance ticket if you can come to our show (tickets available at www.fringenyc.org).

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Xandra Schultz, 22 year old recent college graduate living in NYC. I have always been passionate about theater, and I'm so happy to share this play with the world. When I was in the worst parts of my struggle, I never thought I would get to this point in my life. I am pursuing an acting career in New York City with the support of my amazing friends and family. I love to not only act, sing, and dance - I am also passionate about writing, directing, and producing theater. This campaign means so much to me for so many reasons; it's not only a sort of catharsis for me, it's also a chance for me to cast some of my very talented friends in something that I created. It can be difficult as a twenty-something actor in New York to feel creatively fulfilled when you're getting more rejections than job offers. This is a chance for me to not only work with some of my best friends, but to also give them an opportunity to show the world how talented they truly are; and to work on something that really matters to us. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am putting this play up completely of my own volition and funding, so honestly anything helps! Renting an Off Off Broadway space for one performance can run anywhere from $250-$1000. I am currently looking for a venue that will work for all our needs, so the cost is still up in the air. Things like props, costumes, lights, sound, and people (actors and crew) cost money, too! Truly, anything helps; if you have $5 to donate, awesome. If you have $500 to donate, awesome. Anyone who donates will automatically receive a ticket to the show!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Share this campaign! On facebook, instagram, myspace, whatever!</p>
<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>This play will be premiering in NYC on Saturday, October 8. Any amount of money helps, sharing this campaign on social media helps, even your kind words help! Thank you so, so much for taking the time to read all of this and for your help.</p>

<h3>About ACW Dances</h3>
<p>ACW Dances was born in 2013 when Abigail Wallace and Kerry Doyle set out to create a new modern dance company. Founded on the idea that art should be accessible to all, we keep our ticket prices $10 with children 12 and under free. The very first performance of a 20-minute duet with live musical accompaniment was free of charge, performed in an art gallery in Alexandria, VA, where ACW Dances still performs at least yearly (still free of charge).</p>
<p>However, the dedication to affordable performance still has a cost. We receive a generous space and services grant from Arlington County which allows us to rehearse and perform in a lovely black box theater 1-2 times per year. In order to pay the dancers, buy costumes, hire light designers, get stage managers, and more, we need to reach out to you!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>This year, it's simple.</h3>
<p>We're keeping our 4th season light. We have a free fall performance this November in VA, a works in progress concert in DC in March, and a black box theater show also in VA in May. This allows us to ask for less money and still provide our artists with some compensation for their talent, dedication, and hard work.</p>
<p>Here's the breakdown for our year:</p>
<p>FALL:</p>
<p>Dancers: $700 for rehearsals and performance stipend<br/>Artistic Director: $200</p>
<p>SPRING:</p>
<p>Dancers: $2400 rehearsal and performance stipends ($300 per dancer, 8 total)<br/>Artistic Director: $200<br/>Lighting Designer: $300<br/>Stage Manager: $150<br/>Tech Help: $150<br/>Publicity &amp; Marketing: $200<br/>Props &amp; Costumes: $200<br/>Gels, other equipment: $100<br/>Fees: $120</p>
<p>Total: $4720</p>
</div><div>
<p>We are subject to a 10% fee on all donations, so we really need $5,192 in order to fully afford this year's work. Amounts raised in excess of our goal, if any, will go toward producing future work. Should we not meet our goal, we will downscale productions throughout the year so that the money raised is able to cover our expenses.</p>
<h3>Why help us?</h3>
<p>Supporting us helps provide affordable art to people in all types of communities. We are unique in that we celebrate being an all-female dance company that continues to push the limits of what is possible in choreography both athletically and thematically. We also have a four-year history of success in running fundraising campaigns and of using those funds to produce critically acclaimed shows.</p>
<p>Our dancers include Abigail Wallace (founder and director), Paula Giammarco (4th season), Rachel Zappala (3rd season), Katherine LiPuma (2nd season), Samantha Sobash (1st season), as well as various adjunct artists that participate in periodic performances. Read all about them on Facebook and our website, plus follow ACW Dances on Twitter and Instagram for more!</p>

<h3>Other ways to help:</h3>
<p>If you are unable to donate, you can still make our season a success! Please share our campaign and steer other possible donors our way. Make noise so that people know we exist and that we are here to connect to the greater artistic community. DC/VA/MD locals: come to our events!</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to stop by and take a look at our project.  It is only with your help that we can produce our work.  We appreciate your consideration and generosity!  Please consider asking your employer if they participate in matching donations as this is a great way to make a larger contribution.  Our fiscal sponsor, Fractured Atlas, is able to meet all 501(c)(3) requirements for tax deduction purposes. </p>

<h3>Okay Sure, But Who Are You?</h3>
<p>My name is Jeff Newman. I hold a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from Wright State University in Dayton, OH and have been producing theatre with consistency since earning my degree in 2009. I have brought professional successful productions clear through to closing night in Dayton, Kansas City, as well as Chicago.</p>

<p>I'm no stranger to the rough and tumble world of the Chicago storefront theatre scene. Since moving here in 2011 I have written, directed, produced, and performed for several companies throughout the city. My work has been seen at City Lit, Stage 773, The Public House Theatre, Prop Thtr, The Alley Stage, The Berger Park Coach House, The Frontier, The Right Brain Project, Angel Island, as well as The Think Tank just to name a few.</p>
<p>Each experience has taught me to be a better all around theatre artist and it has become the personal mission of Hot Shot Productions to create an atmosphere in which artists feel free to contribute during the process and are genuinely proud of the product they've helped create.</p>

Each experience has taught me to be a better all around theatre artist and it has become the personal mission of Hot Shot Productions to create an atmosphere in which artists feel free to contribute during the process and are genuinely proud of the product they've helped create.

YOU Can Make A Difference!
Chicago is the perfect community for the kind of challenging, low budget theatre experience that has become the hallmark of HSP. But no production simply falls out of the clear blue sky. It is only with your generosity, investment, and faith that we are able to deliver the quality theatre experience our audiences truly deserve. For more details on past productions, take a look at our slick new Hot Shot Productions Website!

But Dude, I'm Kinda Broke
You got no money? I can relate! But that doesn't mean you can't help:

You can share this campaign and video on all your social media
You can show the trailer video to friends and ask them  to share it too
You can check out our slick new Hot Shot Productions Website and share THAT TOO

All this without spending a dollar or getting up from your computer!
Believe me, it really does help.",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

Strife.tv and TheBboySpot.com, two legitimate names in the worldwide bboy dance community, would like to create three, $500 dollar scholarships for bboy / bgirl dancers attending university in USA and Canada during the Fall of 2011. The hip hop dance community needs more educated dancers. We need to expand our culture, have future leaders, and work in a more professional manner. To keep everything growing in the right direction, we will need to work with those who know our community because they are part of the community.
The Impact

Currently, many bboys finish high school and fail to consider higher education. Many pursue careers in entertainment and do not have a backup plan. These small scholarships will create awareness amongst the dance community for higher education beyond high school.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Summer Shakespeare brings free arts education programs to children and youth in Ghana. The program is entirely free for participants and is funded solely by donations from people like you. The heart of Summer Shakespeare is our vibrant volunteer community, without whom we could not do the work we do. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><span>It is extremely important that this program is  kept free, in order to keep it accessible for the general population of youth in Accra. Of course, this means that we need other people to help us pay for necessities like scripts, costumes, props, production costs, and all the other things that come with running a project like this. We also need help getting five of our teaching staff, Nikaury Roman, Kristen Lang, Grace Lazarz, Felicia Santiago &amp; Daniella Novas, across the Atlantic so she can help out with the program on the ground.</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><span>There is a lot of talent in Accra, and not nearly enough platforms. For young people who are interested in the performing arts, particularly theatre, there are very few opportunities to experience the performance process as a professional. This is a unique opportunity to be involved in every aspect of the play making process from start to finish, to take ownership of the most powerful tool we have: language. </span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<div>Thanks for checking out our project!If you can't help directly with funding, you can still help by telling your friends, family and other contacts about us. We always need help</div>

There is a lot of talent in Accra, and not nearly enough platforms. For young people who are interested in the performing arts, particularly theatre, there are very few opportunities to experience the performance process as a professional. This is a unique opportunity to be involved in every aspect of the play making process from start to finish, to take ownership of the most powerful tool we have: language.

<p> </p>
<p>THE PERFORMANCES</p>
<p>From November 2012 to late March 2013, Cambodian Living Arts organized a program of performances called <em>Plae Pakaa (Fruitful)</em>. Six days a week, <em>Plae Pakaa</em> featured a rotating program of 3 Cambodian traditional arts performances  set in the splendid gardens of the National Museum, Phnom Penh:</p>
<p><em><strong>Children of Bassac (Classical &amp; folk dance)</strong>:</em></p>
<p>Performed by a troupe filled with energy and creativity, this show includes both Apsara and folk dances from Khmer and other Cambodian ethnic minority cultures.</p>
<p><em><strong>Mak Therng (theatre &amp; music)</strong>:</em></p>
<p>This show is a piece from the <em>Yike </em>repertoire, a popular folk art form. It tells a classical Cambodian tale of love and betrayal. His young wife kidnapped by a prince, Mak Therng sets out on a quest for justice, but where will this lead him? This show includes dance, drama and beautiful singing.</p>
<p><em><strong>Passage of Live (theatre &amp; music)</strong>:</em></p>
<p>Cambodian life is rich with elaborate rituals accompanied by some of the most beautiful Khmer musical forms. This show is a voyage that begins from the greetings of birth to the farewells of death, sweetened by celebrations of love and adulthood.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>With <em>Plae Pakaa</em>, Cambodian Living Arts aims to create long-ranging job opportunities in the country’s broader arts sector. Our hope is for any Cambodian artist or arts professional to achieve the dreams of their youth to one day performing on a stage before a live audience.</p>
<p><em>Plae Pakaa</em>, which translates literally as “coming to fruition”, symbolizes the trees of traditional arts that are now bearing fruit after a long period of growth. It also symbolizes the emerging artists who are sharing the fruits of their efforts with us. From November to late March – the dry season in Cambodia – CLA was able to employ over 120 artists and other arts professionals, six nights a week,offering them a springboard toward future career opportunities in arts productions. We are proud that 65 of the 90 performers have been trained by CLA.</p>
<p>Music and ensemble leader in the theatre and music play <em>Passage of Live</em> Nhok Sinat says:</p>
<p><em>“Plae Pakaa gives us an opportunity to earn a living through art, to develop our skills, and to raise awareness about Cambodian traditions. Choosing the right music to fit the proper emotion in each scene was an interesting challenge.”</em></p>

<h3>CAMBODIA’S BACKGROUND</h3>
<p>Before the Khmer Rouge era, Cambodia was home to some of the most diverse and abundant arts and culture in Southeast Asia. Music, dance, theater and cinema flowed strongly through the blood of the Cambodian people. There were singers on every corner, musicians in every village and a dancer in every child. Art flourished. But in the years between 1975 and 1979, the Khmer Rouge brought a devastating end to all of that. It is estimated that during those years, 2 million Cambodians died from execution, starvation and overwork. It is also believed that among the dead were 90% percent of Cambodia’s artists who were specifically targeted for execution, a devastating blow to Cambodia’s artistic traditions. After the fall of the Khmer Rouge, this human and cultural tragedy was compounded by two subsequent decades of crippling economic hardship. Of the Master Artists that survived, few could make a living by performing or teaching.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">CAMBODIAN LIVING ARTS’ BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p>Fifteen years ago, Cambodia was in danger of losing its artistic and identity, memory and heritage. Cambodian Living Arts was created in 1998 with a focus on recovery and preservation of Cambodia’s traditional arts, by providing classes to Cambodian youth, allowing them to acquire basic artistic skills. At its onset, the organization provided support to 16 Master Artists and 11 assistant teachers, reaching over 200 students in 8 provinces in Cambodia yearly. But context and needs of Cambodian society evolved, a new generation of artists emerged and 10 years after its creation the organization had to evolve and adapt its actions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In 2009 Cambodian Living Arts welcomed Phloeun Prim as its new Director. We focused on developing talents and skills to increase national and international recognition and awareness of Cambodian arts and culture. Rather than providing support on a local level, in only a few communities, we hope in the future to enable  sustainability for the arts on a national scale, and to raise awareness globally.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<h3>CAMBODIAN LIVING ARTS’ MISSION AND VISION</h3>
<p><strong>OUR MISSION</strong></p>
<p>The mission of Cambodian Living Arts is to facilitate the transformation of Cambodia through the arts. We work in collaboration with others to create an environment where Cambodian arts empower and transform individuals and communities. We do this by encouraging the growth of artists and the arts community, by promoting awareness of the arts, and by advocating for the arts with cultural policymakers and major institutions. In doing so, we hope to create value and understanding of what it means to be Cambodian and to create a sense of unity and shared culture. We believe that through creativity we can each expand our potential as human beings.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>OUR VISION</strong></p>
<p>By 2020, we envision a vibrant and dynamic cultural sector throughout Cambodia, with the arts as the country’s national and international signature. Cambodian Living Arts will be a catalyst for this development. The successful transformation of Cambodia’s cultural identity will be a model for other emerging societies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>COMMUNITY ARTS EDUCATION</strong></p>
<p class=""align-justify"">CLA’s Community Arts program aims to provide training and encourage the practice of high-quality, traditional performing arts in communities throughout Cambodia. The program is composed of teaching activities and workshops.</p>
<p>Since 1998, CLA has created 28 classes of traditional performing arts in 9 provinces in Cambodia, reaching over 500 students.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4><strong>BY THE FIGURES</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>28</strong> classes reaching out to <strong>500</strong> students</li>
<li>
<strong>40</strong> teachers of <strong>12</strong> art forms</li>
<li>
<strong>9</strong> provinces</li>
</ul><p class=""align-justify""> </p>
<p><strong>CAPACITY BUILDING</strong></p>
<p>At CLA, we help promising youth further their arts education by awarding them scholarships and providing them with real-world training and mentorship to support their growth as professionals. We also work to develop the existing arts sector by building the expertise of arts supervisors and managers.</p>
<p>CLA’s Capacity Building program aims to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Help to staff the Cambodian arts sector with well trained, Cambodian arts professionals working to international standards;</li>
<li>Have CLA’s trainees become recognized in the arts sector for their skill and professionalism.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p><strong>CREATIVE INDUSTRIES</strong></p>
<p>All the arts education in the world amounts to little if, after years of training, there isn’t viable employment for Cambodia’s professional artists and arts professionals.  That’s why CLA focuses on improving job opportunities in the country’s broader arts sector as the final stage in the  growth-cycle of CLA and non-CLA graduates.</p>
<p>We want to foster the independent capability of emerging artists and other arts professionals, so they can form their own performance troupes and become Cambodia’s premier working performers.</p>
<p>Our Creative Industries program aims to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Help arts professionals find consistent, well-paid work in the arts and culture sector, supported by Cambodian audiences.</li>
<li>Have 50% of CLA’s audiences in Cambodia consist of native Cambodians within 3 years.</li>
<li>Have 50% of CLA’s funding generated by our Cambodian operations within 5 years.</li>
</ul><p> </p>

Performed by a troupe filled with energy and creativity, this show includes both Apsara and folk dances from Khmer and other Cambodian ethnic minority cultures.
Mak Therng (theatre & music):
This show is a piece from the Yike repertoire, a popular folk art form. It tells a classical Cambodian tale of love and betrayal. His young wife kidnapped by a prince, Mak Therng sets out on a quest for justice, but where will this lead him? This show includes dance, drama and beautiful singing.
Passage of Live (theatre & music):
Cambodian life is rich with elaborate rituals accompanied by some of the most beautiful Khmer musical forms. This show is a voyage that begins from the greetings of birth to the farewells of death, sweetened by celebrations of love and adulthood.
 
    
 
With Plae Pakaa, Cambodian Living Arts aims to create long-ranging job opportunities in the country’s broader arts sector. Our hope is for any Cambodian artist or arts professional to achieve the dreams of their youth to one day performing on a stage before a live audience.
Plae Pakaa, which translates literally as “coming to fruition”, symbolizes the trees of traditional arts that are now bearing fruit after a long period of growth. It also symbolizes the emerging artists who are sharing the fruits of their efforts with us. From November to late March – the dry season in Cambodia – CLA was able to employ over 120 artists and other arts professionals, six nights a week,offering them a springboard toward future career opportunities in arts productions. We are proud that 65 of the 90 performers have been trained by CLA.
Music and ensemble leader in the theatre and music play Passage of Live Nhok Sinat says:
“Plae Pakaa gives us an opportunity to earn a living through art, to develop our skills, and to raise awareness about Cambodian traditions. Choosing the right music to fit the proper emotion in each scene was an interesting challenge.”

CAMBODIA’S BACKGROUND
Before the Khmer Rouge era, Cambodia was home to some of the most diverse and abundant arts and culture in Southeast Asia. Music, dance, theater and cinema flowed strongly through the blood of the Cambodian people. There were singers on every corner, musicians in every village and a dancer in every child. Art flourished. But in the years between 1975 and 1979, the Khmer Rouge brought a devastating end to all of that. It is estimated that during those years, 2 million Cambodians died from execution, starvation and overwork. It is also believed that among the dead were 90% percent of Cambodia’s artists who were specifically targeted for execution, a devastating blow to Cambodia’s artistic traditions. After the fall of the Khmer Rouge, this human and cultural tragedy was compounded by two subsequent decades of crippling economic hardship. Of the Master Artists that survived, few could make a living by performing or teaching.
 
CAMBODIAN LIVING ARTS’ BACKGROUND
Fifteen years ago, Cambodia was in danger of losing its artistic and identity, memory and heritage. Cambodian Living Arts was created in 1998 with a focus on recovery and preservation of Cambodia’s traditional arts, by providing classes to Cambodian youth, allowing them to acquire basic artistic skills. At its onset, the organization provided support to 16 Master Artists and 11 assistant teachers, reaching over 200 students in 8 provinces in Cambodia yearly. But context and needs of Cambodian society evolved, a new generation of artists emerged and 10 years after its creation the organization had to evolve and adapt its actions.
 
In 2009 Cambodian Living Arts welcomed Phloeun Prim as its new Director. We focused on developing talents and skills to increase national and international recognition and awareness of Cambodian arts and culture. Rather than providing support on a local level, in only a few communities, we hope in the future to enable  sustainability for the arts on a national scale, and to raise awareness globally.
 
 
 
CAMBODIAN LIVING ARTS’ MISSION AND VISION
OUR MISSION
The mission of Cambodian Living Arts is to facilitate the transformation of Cambodia through the arts. We work in collaboration with others to create an environment where Cambodian arts empower and transform individuals and communities. We do this by encouraging the growth of artists and the arts community, by promoting awareness of the arts, and by advocating for the arts with cultural policymakers and major institutions. In doing so, we hope to create value and understanding of what it means to be Cambodian and to create a sense of unity and shared culture. We believe that through creativity we can each expand our potential as human beings.
 
OUR VISION
By 2020, we envision a vibrant and dynamic cultural sector throughout Cambodia, with the arts as the country’s national and international signature. Cambodian Living Arts will be a catalyst for this development. The successful transformation of Cambodia’s cultural identity will be a model for other emerging societies.
 
COMMUNITY ARTS EDUCATION
CLA’s Community Arts program aims to provide training and encourage the practice of high-quality, traditional performing arts in communities throughout Cambodia. The program is composed of teaching activities and workshops.
Since 1998, CLA has created 28 classes of traditional performing arts in 9 provinces in Cambodia, reaching over 500 students.

28 classes reaching out to 500 students

40 teachers of 12 art forms

9 provinces
 
CAPACITY BUILDING
At CLA, we help promising youth further their arts education by awarding them scholarships and providing them with real-world training and mentorship to support their growth as professionals. We also work to develop the existing arts sector by building the expertise of arts supervisors and managers.
CLA’s Capacity Building program aims to:

Help to staff the Cambodian arts sector with well trained, Cambodian arts professionals working to international standards;
Have CLA’s trainees become recognized in the arts sector for their skill and professionalism.
 
CREATIVE INDUSTRIES
All the arts education in the world amounts to little if, after years of training, there isn’t viable employment for Cambodia’s professional artists and arts professionals.  That’s why CLA focuses on improving job opportunities in the country’s broader arts sector as the final stage in the  growth-cycle of CLA and non-CLA graduates.
We want to foster the independent capability of emerging artists and other arts professionals, so they can form their own performance troupes and become Cambodia’s premier working performers.
Our Creative Industries program aims to:

Help arts professionals find consistent, well-paid work in the arts and culture sector, supported by Cambodian audiences.
Have 50% of CLA’s audiences in Cambodia consist of native Cambodians within 3 years.
Have 50% of CLA’s funding generated by our Cambodian operations within 5 years.

Art is the most profound method of communication between people.  If there is no art there is no love, there is no friendship, there are only isolated, lonely individuals. Art is the deep way in which individuals can reach each other and it is the best way in which we can overcome our differences of race, class and language. I became an artist to understand people more deeply, both those whom I already thought I knew and those who came to me as strangers or as others, across a cultural divide.

I am a <a href=""http://thanospl.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">composer, researcher and music theatre maker</a>. Quicklime is part of my PhD research on Music Theatre at Sussex University (UK). I have involved a group of practitioners and researchers in my project: experimenting on music theatre. So far we have managed to devise a performance that is worth to be shared with the public. We have showed <a href=""http://thanospl.net/?tag=heiner-muller"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">different stages of this research in the UK</a>, and now we need the funds to make this project travel, in order to share it with different audiences.</p><p>Music theatre productions are very demanding and costly, as they involve performers, musicians, set designers, equipment, material etc…<br/>So far I have managed to maintain the budget of the production to the absolute minimum, because I was lucky enough to work with very understanding practitioners, who accepted to rehearse, research and perform in kind.<br/>Now I am at the point where the performance is ready to travel abroad and be shared with a larger crowd.<br/>The only thing that is holding me back is that travel expenses of all the people involved and the gear can be extremely costly… to the extent that we cannot self-fund it anymore!</p><p>Your contribution will help me pay the travel expenses of the performers and the shipment of the equipment, instruments and set.

I’m Thanos. I am a composer, researcher and music theatre maker. Quicklime is part of my PhD research on Music Theatre at Sussex University (UK). I have involved a group of practitioners and researchers in my project: experimenting on music theatre. So far we have managed to devise a performance that is worth to be shared with the public. We have showed different stages of this research in the UK, and now we need the funds to make this project travel, in order to share it with different audiences.Music theatre productions are very demanding and costly, as they involve performers, musicians, set designers, equipment, material etc…So far I have managed to maintain the budget of the production to the absolute minimum, because I was lucky enough to work with very understanding practitioners, who accepted to rehearse, research and perform in kind.Now I am at the point where the performance is ready to travel abroad and be shared with a larger crowd.The only thing that is holding me back is that travel expenses of all the people involved and the gear can be extremely costly… to the extent that we cannot self-fund it anymore!Your contribution will help me pay the travel expenses of the performers and the shipment of the equipment, instruments and set. And will make our dream possible: to get Quicklime to be performed in the New Benaki Museum for OUT_TOPIAS (Athens, GR), and in Modern Body Festival (Den Haag, NL), giving visibility to the work and to the professionals involved.I am asking for 2000EUR to cover the travel expenses of 8 performers to two festivals  and the shipment of the gear and the set to these two events.In exchange for your generous contribution, I’ve tried to design the rewards drawing from the personal abilities of mine and of my collaborators… we are all professional practitioners of the performing arts, ready to share our knowledge in the field!All rewards are transferable - so you could use them as a gift for someone you love!If I do not manage to reach the entire goal, the funds I’ll manage to get will go towards covering most of the travel expenses of the performers and I will try to work out other ways to cover the shipment of equipment and set.If I do not manage to get anything from this campaign…. the show must go on! So we will have to put this amount from our pockets, which means big sacrifices in our daily lives.Quicklime is an independent production of an experimental performance.Our aim is not to profit but rather to experiment with new performance experiences and offer them to the public.If you want to help us in other ways share this funding campaign with very rich friends/ acquaintances and come see the performances in Athens and in Den Haag!Quicklime is devised with and performed by:M.

URANIA es un espectáculo sonoro y visual que se basa en descubrimientos de la ciencia para difundir a través del arte, la música, el canto, la danza y proyecciones audiovisuales, toda la sabiduría que se manifiesta en la naturaleza, tanto en el cosmos, como en las plantas, los minerales, animales,  y en las culturas ancestrales que poblaron la tierra en la antigüedad. 
Durante el espectáculo el público llegará a un estado elevado de vibración a través de dos caminos: intelectualmente, internalizando la información científica, y emocionalmente sensibilizando los sentidos a través del arte.
De esta manera se despertará el recuerdo del verdadero lugar al que pertenecemos como parte integrada a la totalidad, comprendiendo el rol que desempeñamos como especie que convive en perfecta armonía con el entorno.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>""An actor...is an actor...is an actor"" was written and performed for the first time by Zijah Sokolovic back in 1978 and has since then been performed by him for over 30 years and in over 20 different countries. It is considered one of the most successful one man shows in Europe and it has been translated to several languages. Performed for the first time in New York in 1991 this one man show returns again for a short run in one of the greatest cities on Earth. </p>
<p>The show focuses on the part of the ""actor"" in today's show business and the struggles one has to overcome in order to be successful. It is divided into two parts in which the actor interacts with the audience, reflects on his past and present experiences and tries to find meaning in the art of acting.</p>
<p>Performed and directed by Almir Kurtic the play is in it's final stages and almost ready to be shown to the public. Since it's an independent production we are in need for additional funding which would cover venue costs and marketing materials. </p>

<p><strong>Zijah Sokolovic</strong> (born 1950 in Sarajevo, FPR Yugoslavia) is a Bosnian actor, writer and director who lives, acts and directs in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Slovenia and Austria. He is a director of Theaterland in Salzburg, professor in Bruckner Konservatorium in Linz, artistic director of Dežela gledališča theatre in Ljubljana and artistic project leader for Dramatic society, Dramatično društvo, but also directs plays in Zagreb. He is most known for his one man shows ""An Actor...is an Actor...is an Actor"", ""Cabares Cabarei"" and many more. Working in stage and TV/Film for over 40 years, Zijah Sokolovic is considered one of the most acclaimed actors/writers/directors of the European region.</p>

<p><strong>Almir Kurtic</strong> is an actor from Bosnia and Herzegovina currently attending The Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute in New York. He earned his Bachelor's degree in Acting in 2014 at the Academy of Performing Arts in Tuzla (Bosnia and Herzegovina) in the class of acclaimed actress Selma Alispahic. In 2016 Almir was awarded the Eleonora Duse Scholarship at The Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute where he's currently finishing his two year conservatory in Method Acting. Almir's stage work expands over 7 years and ranges from classic plays (""The Odyssey"", ""Timon of Athens"", ""Don Quixote"") to contemporary works (""Unity 1918"", ""The Motherfucker with The Hat"") and many more. He can be seen in the upcoming production of ""Ajax in Iraq"" which will run at The Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute from November 9th.</p>

<h3>About SUCKERS:</h3>
<p>Desire turns to love turns to wrath turns to apathy in this bitter comedy about friendship, fate, and the often unexpected transiency of life. SUCKERS follows the intertwining “love story” of four post-graduate, twenty-somethings, trapped in the cyclical black hole of each other. Jane, Alex, Daisy, and Holden let the fear of the unknown stop them from breaking free. Who will find their way out in this biting commentary on the danger of complacency, the giddiness of a beginning, and the beauty of finality?</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why are we telling this story:</h3>
<p>SUCKERS is the premiere project of a brand new production company in New York City: Seeded Productions. Founded by Carly Speno, Leah Beth Etheredge, and Rachel Gifford, Seeded is a production company that developed out of an urge to feed the artistic hunger so many artists experience upon moving to New York City. Seeded presents opportunities for emerging voices and budding artists to do the work that fulfills them. It aims to champion the artist as a whole and serves as a channel for production, backing, support, and growth of individual projects and interests.<br/>SUCKERS was the perfect project to launch our company, as it's author is someone near and dear to our hearts. As peers in the same Musical Theatre program at TCU, we watched Devin emerge as a gifted and important young playwright. She has grown to be a close friend and colleague and we are honored and proud to help her bring SUCKERS to life. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Your Impact:</h3>
<p>You're literally helping us put on this show. From renting the space, to props/lighting/set/costumes, to marketing and promotional costs, plus everything in between - you are truly the backbone of this endeavor. Without your contributions and support, this important story couldn't be told in New York City. </p>
<p>Your impact is also felt beyond SUCKERS. If we surpass our goal, this money will go directly toward building a foundation for our production company. These donations will serve as a launching pad for Seeded Productions to fulfill it's mission of regularly producing theatre that champions the artist as a whole. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to make this dream a reality, we need your help: </p>
<p>We're asking for about 3200 in total for the production of SUCKERS. Our venue alone costs around half that. The rest of your donations will go toward production costs (sets, costumes, props), marketing materials, and compensation for the playwright. </p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">We know your giving is generous! We've come up with some ""sweet"" (suckers, get it?) perks to make your donation a little more worth while!</span></p>

Spring Awakening hit me like a bolt of lightning, and my parents wholeheartedly disapproved.

Tony Award-winning original Moritz John Gallagher Jr., in talking about his similarities to his character, describes how when he was a teenager, he would hide away in his room with his acoustic guitar, and that “for [him] and countless teenagers, music is such an integral part of maturing and growing up and escaping.” I’m so intrigued by what happens when we give Moritz that guitar and the same escape.</p><p>So, you have a full ten piece band, and a cast of eleven actors.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong><a href=""http://www.worcester-rep.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>The Worcester Repertory Company</i></a> </strong>was founded in the 1960s and has provided a home to many household names over the years. <strong>Imelda Staunton</strong>, <strong>Sean Pertwee</strong>, <strong>David Wood</strong>, <strong>Celia Imrie</strong>, <strong>Bonnie Langford</strong>, <strong>John Doyle</strong>, <strong>Phyllida Lloyd</strong>, <strong>Mark Strong</strong> and many others got their professional start with the Worcester Rep. and we continue to produce top quality professional theatre for our audiences.</p>
<p>This is our first crowdfunding campaign and we are looking for support in bringing a new piece of writing to the stage. Funding for the arts is a constant battle and one that many organisations lose. The Worcester Rep. has managed to survive with no Arts Council funding and still produces between 5 - 10 shows per year in venues across the county. 2016 saw our first international transfer with Ben Humphrey's production of <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> making its way to the National Theatre of Romania for the International Shakespeare Festival.</p>
<p>The Rep's work is beginning to catch the attentions of a wide demographic and your help in staging this production would be incredible.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The approximate total cost of producing <i>An Unhealthy Cure</i> will be <strong>£3,500</strong>.</p>
<p>Things we need to pay for when considering a new production:</p>
<p>Actors - This is really important!</p>
<p>Marketing - Getting people to come and see the play is probably the most important thing. Otherwise, there really is no point.</p>
<p>Stage Management/Production - Without the backstage team nothing would get seen onstage. </p>
<p>All of this is before the writers get paid and knock on costs such as Box Office, ticketing and Front of House is taken into account.</p>
<p>By helping us to raise <strong>£1,500 </strong>you will be ensuring that new work remains on the stage and that a unique production is available for all to see. There are of course perks to donating to our campaign. Everything from acknowledgement in the programme to VIP treatment at the premiere. There are so many ways to be a part of the production.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The great Stella Adler once said:</p>
<p><i>""</i><i>Theatre was created to tell people the truth about life and the social situation."" </i></p>
<p>By donating to our campaign you will be helping us, as a theatre, make that a reality. Live performance can be a life-changing experience and your donations help to keep theatre live.</p>
<p>The Worcester Rep's. work in recent years has been diverse and well-received. We perform in venues such as cathedrals, schools, theatres, halls, outdoor gardens and everywhere and anywhere in between. Some of our recent projects have included:</p>
<p>Outdoor performances; A transfer to the National Theatre of Romania; Theatre in Education projects in conjunction with Worcester Bosch and Worcester Cathedral, and we will also be staging a special production of Shakespeare's <i>King John, </i>at the tomb of the monarch on the 800th Anniversary of his death.</p>
<p>This production explores a subject that everyone can relate to. Cancer. It subverts the ideas we have of finding a cure and looks to create conversation and debate surrounding one of the biggest global killers. Everybody knows somebody...and everyone will have an opinion on the play.</p>
<p>The play will also be adapted for radio and recorded at the Old Smithy Studios.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.worcester-rep.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i><strong>The Worcester Repertory Company </strong></i></a>is a non-profit organisation and run by the Worcester Live Charitable Trust. If we are lucky enough to raise more than our target figure or the production makes money it will all be re-invested in producing work, supporting youth theatre, and keeping the arts alive in Worcestershire. Not a penny will go to shareholders...we don't have any!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>

</div></div>","Short Summary
The Worcester Repertory Company was founded in the 1960s and has provided a home to many household names over the years. Imelda Staunton, Sean Pertwee, David Wood, Celia Imrie, Bonnie Langford, John Doyle, Phyllida Lloyd, Mark Strong and many others got their professional start with the Worcester Rep. and we continue to produce top quality professional theatre for our audiences.
This is our first crowdfunding campaign and we are looking for support in bringing a new piece of writing to the stage. Funding for the arts is a constant battle and one that many organisations lose. The Worcester Rep. has managed to survive with no Arts Council funding and still produces between 5 - 10 shows per year in venues across the county. 2016 saw our first international transfer with Ben Humphrey's production of The Comedy of Errors making its way to the National Theatre of Romania for the International Shakespeare Festival.
The Rep's work is beginning to catch the attentions of a wide demographic and your help in staging this production would be incredible.
 

What We Need & What You Get
The approximate total cost of producing An Unhealthy Cure will be £3,500.
Things we need to pay for when considering a new production:
Actors - This is really important!
Marketing - Getting people to come and see the play is probably the most important thing. Otherwise, there really is no point.
Stage Management/Production - Without the backstage team nothing would get seen onstage. 
All of this is before the writers get paid and knock on costs such as Box Office, ticketing and Front of House is taken into account.
By helping us to raise £1,500 you will be ensuring that new work remains on the stage and that a unique production is available for all to see. There are of course perks to donating to our campaign. Everything from acknowledgement in the programme to VIP treatment at the premiere. There are so many ways to be a part of the production.
 

The Impact
The great Stella Adler once said:
""Theatre was created to tell people the truth about life and the social situation."" 
By donating to our campaign you will be helping us, as a theatre, make that a reality. Live performance can be a life-changing experience and your donations help to keep theatre live.
The Worcester Rep's. work in recent years has been diverse and well-received. We perform in venues such as cathedrals, schools, theatres, halls, outdoor gardens and everywhere and anywhere in between. Some of our recent projects have included:
Outdoor performances; A transfer to the National Theatre of Romania; Theatre in Education projects in conjunction with Worcester Bosch and Worcester Cathedral, and we will also be staging a special production of Shakespeare's King John, at the tomb of the monarch on the 800th Anniversary of his death.
This production explores a subject that everyone can relate to. Cancer. It subverts the ideas we have of finding a cure and looks to create conversation and debate surrounding one of the biggest global killers. Everybody knows somebody...and everyone will have an opinion on the play.
The play will also be adapted for radio and recorded at the Old Smithy Studios.
The Worcester Repertory Company is a non-profit organisation and run by the Worcester Live Charitable Trust. If we are lucky enough to raise more than our target figure or the production makes money it will all be re-invested in producing work, supporting youth theatre, and keeping the arts alive in Worcestershire. Not a penny will go to shareholders...we don't have any!
 

Risks & Challenges
One of the biggest risks with staging new work is convincing people to invest in the time to come and see it. With audiences increasingly looking for 'star names' or TV celebrities, companies such as the Worcester Rep. must work much harder to bring the audiences into the theatre. This campaign is as much about creating awareness of the play as it is about fundraising.
The Worcester Rep. may be a small producing house but we punch above our weight with top quality work that always engages audiences.
 

Other Ways You Can Help
Contributions to the campaign will obviously help us. There's no denying that. But for those who can't or don't feel able to contribute there are lots of other ways you can help:

Share the campaign with family and friends.
Follow us on Social Media and RT/share news about the production.

<h3><i>Distorted Realities</i></h3>
<h3>
<strong>Artistic Director Bio:</strong> </h3>
<p>Brigette Dunn-Korpela is the founder and Artistic director of  B. Dunn Movement, educator, choreographer and performing artist. Her educational credentials include an MFA in choreography from the California Institute of the Arts Sharon Disney Lund School of Dance and a B.A. in dance from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Currently, Ms. Dunn-Korpela is an Assistant Professor of Dance in the department of Kinesiology at California State University, Northridge. She is an innovative artist who explores viscerally-authentic approaches towards creative self expression. Her performance credits include the 1st National U.S. tour of <i>The Lion King</i>. She has performed works by choreographers, Ronald K. Brown, Nathan Trice, Donald Mckayle and Katherine Dunham, to name a few and former member of the Cleo Parker Robinson Dance Ensemble. She has appeared at the Kennedy Center, Brooklyn Academy of Music, NJPAC, Aaron Davis Hall, and the Gomhouria Theatre of the Cairo Opera House, Egypt.</p>
<h3><strong>Project Description: </strong></h3>
<p><strong><i>Distorted Realities</i></strong>, is a 15-20 minute dance/theatre collaboration with six performers and artistic direction by Brigette Dunn-Korpela that will premier May 4-6, 2017 at the Bootleg Theater in Los Angeles, CA. This project is facilitated by Dance Resource Center's Homegrown @ Bootleg Series. A program that supports emerging choreographers in the L.A area promote and produce their work to larger audiences. <strong><i>Distorted Realities</i></strong> seeks to investigate the hyper-normalization of human apathy and sanitized violence. This work is in direct response to the current social climate of increased human indifference, deafening silence of human compassion and political lunacy. Movement investigations are athletically charged rooted in contemporary modern dance vocabulary. Creative research is influenced by Brutalist aesthetics, American and European 1940-50’s mass media culture and German expressionism. It is the hope of this work to observe the parallels in recent history where human indifference was normalized and sanitized.</p>

<p><strong>Hi there!</strong></p>
<p><strong>This is Jason Weiss, the director of Magiko.</strong></p>
<p>About a year ago, I saw my good friend Siegfried Tieber perform in his sold out solo show at the Hollywood Fringe Festival. The show was a smashing success and I was incredibly impressed with both his performance and his ability to craft such a dynamic one man show. Shortly after Siegfried's show closed, I asked him if he'd ever be interested in collaborating on a project. To my delight he was excited by the idea and said he would be thrilled to work together, and as soon as the muse stuck him, he would let me know. Fast forward several months, and I get a call from him asking me if I'd like to grab a coffee (coffee is a big part of our lives). I of course accepted and met him at my corner coffee shop, Dialog Café. Over a delicious Ethiopian dark roast, Siegfried pitched me on an idea for a new solo show, and the rest, as we say, is history!</p>
<p>Siegfried and I have written an incredible solo show that he is staring in and I am directing, and it's called:</p>UPDATE 7/12/15 with 5 hours left to go!!!!</strong><p></p>

We are incredibly proud of Magiko, and want to share our show with the world. This is where you come in.
Siegfried and I are taking Magiko to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, where we have been accepted into one of the most prestigious and successful venues there, Spotlites.

The Edinburgh Fringe Festival is the world's largest arts festival, with the 2014 event spanning 25 days and featuring over 3,193 shows from 51 countries in 299 venues. Established in 1947 as an alternative to the Edinburgh International Festival, it takes place annually in Scotland's capital, in the month of August. The Fringe is a showcase for the performing arts, with show categories including Cabaret, Children's shows, Comedy, Dance, Physical Theatre & Circus, Events, Exhibitions, Music, Musicals and Opera, Spoken Word and Theatre. 
The Fringe has been host to some of the top names in the entertainment industry, and this year, our names will join them.

I escaped to Perpich Center for Arts Education to study music &amp; theatre, where I met my collaborator Charlotte Deutsch, (Director), and began writing some of the very songs in this musical.

<h3><i>Our Story</i></h3>
<div>VERSIPELLIS is the premiere production of two contemporary fusion dancers, Bevin Victoria and Danielle Elizabeth. Bevin Victoria has been a fusion BellyDancer for 4 years. Prior to that she was a nationally ranked sparring champion in Tae Kwon Do, and competitive gymnast for 10 years. She currently holds certifications as a Personal Fitness Trainer, Competitive Gymnastics coach and has many years of training in classical ballet and acro dance among other styles. Danielle Elizabeth holds a degree in fine arts and contemporary dance and has bellydanced for twelve years, with many serious side ventures into the worlds of Butoh Dance Theater and Traditional Balkan Dance, amongst a few other forms. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Originally, this project had been the brainchild of Bevin Victoria for a number of years, and was best described as a series of choreographed pieces loosely based around the idea of primitive human needs/desires, their effects on our relationships with the world around us and how they cause us to shape-shift in order to be fulfilled. The idea of the 'shape-shifter' became a theme in many of her pieces and the exploration of this became more and more urgent until finally, it had to manifest in the show she had imagined for so long. After asking her highly esteemed fellow dancer (and yes, good friend) Danielle to co-produce, the production has come to life with a whole new flavor and some completely unexpected twists. Danielle has created a second aspect of VERSIPELLIS based on <i>her</i> personal main focus over the past few years as a dancer: the connection between live music and dance. She collected an ensemble of musicians that have agreed to compose completely original pieces for the show and she will compliment each choreography by directing structured improvisations based around the common themes. Together Bevin and Danielle have built a show based on their dual loves of contemporary dance and belly dance, with their strong desire to take it to the stage in an intimate theater setting where subtlety and nuance can become utterly heartbreaking and the larger picture will enrapture entirely.</div>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3><i>The Impact</i></h3>
<div>Our greatest hope for this production is to enlighten multiple genres to each other's presence and create a piece art of that sets a standard and precedent for future belly dance performances. </div>
<div>We want to elevate everyone in the community specifically highlighting the artistry and dynamism that exists between dance and music and celebrates that connection while producing a show that helps the viewer to understand these themes that inspire us on the stage and in life. We want to celebrate art and life through dance and also inspire other performing artists to push themselves and each other so that quality pieces are the mainstay and we all feel good about the projects being made in the belly dance community.</div>
<div>Dance and theater are temporal art forms, but we feel they are just as valuable and precious as the beloved painting that adorns your living room wall, or the intricately carved bronze statue that graces your coffee table or the series of moving pictures sitting on your shelf in the form of DVD's.   </div>

<div>Portland, Oregon is turning into a mecca for belly dance fusion in this country. An over-saturation of sorts tends to happen when a community has more artists than patrons, which in turn, can also mean that new and ground-breaking projects, like VERSIPELLIS, sometimes don't get funded. We strongly believe that there is enough support in this community to encourage the growing number of incredible artists, specifically in this genre however, we want to do one better: we want to create a template for future shows as an example of how professional artists can be sustained by their art. Think about your profession... most people had to go to school, get certified, practice, apprentice or invest a significant amount of time to do what they do. Dancers and musicians are no different. We simply want to support not only the dancers in this show but also, on a larger scale, support the concept that good, dedicated artists can be sustained by their community. We want to keep creating interesting, thought-provoking, engaging pieces of art to simply, put more beauty in the world. Besides, when has more beautiful things to look at ever been a bad thing...? </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>To put it simply, if our project doesn't receive the funding we hope for, ""the show must go on"". Coming out of our pockets for the production, however, will greatly decrease and/or diminish our ability to set the standard we want to set for this type of work. It will also make it impossible for us to reproduce this show anytime in the near future. We need help to compensate our artists and to represent them in the context of this show in a way that will elevate and appreciate their wonderful talents!</div>

</div></div>","Our Story
VERSIPELLIS is the premiere production of two contemporary fusion dancers, Bevin Victoria and Danielle Elizabeth. Bevin Victoria has been a fusion BellyDancer for 4 years. Prior to that she was a nationally ranked sparring champion in Tae Kwon Do, and competitive gymnast for 10 years. She currently holds certifications as a Personal Fitness Trainer, Competitive Gymnastics coach and has many years of training in classical ballet and acro dance among other styles. Danielle Elizabeth holds a degree in fine arts and contemporary dance and has bellydanced for twelve years, with many serious side ventures into the worlds of Butoh Dance Theater and Traditional Balkan Dance, amongst a few other forms. 

Originally, this project had been the brainchild of Bevin Victoria for a number of years, and was best described as a series of choreographed pieces loosely based around the idea of primitive human needs/desires, their effects on our relationships with the world around us and how they cause us to shape-shift in order to be fulfilled. The idea of the 'shape-shifter' became a theme in many of her pieces and the exploration of this became more and more urgent until finally, it had to manifest in the show she had imagined for so long. After asking her highly esteemed fellow dancer (and yes, good friend) Danielle to co-produce, the production has come to life with a whole new flavor and some completely unexpected twists. Danielle has created a second aspect of VERSIPELLIS based on her personal main focus over the past few years as a dancer: the connection between live music and dance. She collected an ensemble of musicians that have agreed to compose completely original pieces for the show and she will compliment each choreography by directing structured improvisations based around the common themes. Together Bevin and Danielle have built a show based on their dual loves of contemporary dance and belly dance, with their strong desire to take it to the stage in an intimate theater setting where subtlety and nuance can become utterly heartbreaking and the larger picture will enrapture entirely.


The Impact
Our greatest hope for this production is to enlighten multiple genres to each other's presence and create a piece art of that sets a standard and precedent for future belly dance performances. 
We want to elevate everyone in the community specifically highlighting the artistry and dynamism that exists between dance and music and celebrates that connection while producing a show that helps the viewer to understand these themes that inspire us on the stage and in life. We want to celebrate art and life through dance and also inspire other performing artists to push themselves and each other so that quality pieces are the mainstay and we all feel good about the projects being made in the belly dance community.
Dance and theater are temporal art forms, but we feel they are just as valuable and precious as the beloved painting that adorns your living room wall, or the intricately carved bronze statue that graces your coffee table or the series of moving pictures sitting on your shelf in the form of DVD's.   

Portland, Oregon is turning into a mecca for belly dance fusion in this country. An over-saturation of sorts tends to happen when a community has more artists than patrons, which in turn, can also mean that new and ground-breaking projects, like VERSIPELLIS, sometimes don't get funded. We strongly believe that there is enough support in this community to encourage the growing number of incredible artists, specifically in this genre however, we want to do one better: we want to create a template for future shows as an example of how professional artists can be sustained by their art. Think about your profession... most people had to go to school, get certified, practice, apprentice or invest a significant amount of time to do what they do. Dancers and musicians are no different. We simply want to support not only the dancers in this show but also, on a larger scale, support the concept that good, dedicated artists can be sustained by their community. We want to keep creating interesting, thought-provoking, engaging pieces of art to simply, put more beauty in the world. Besides, when has more beautiful things to look at ever been a bad thing...? 

To put it simply, if our project doesn't receive the funding we hope for, ""the show must go on"". Coming out of our pockets for the production, however, will greatly decrease and/or diminish our ability to set the standard we want to set for this type of work. It will also make it impossible for us to reproduce this show anytime in the near future. We need help to compensate our artists and to represent them in the context of this show in a way that will elevate and appreciate their wonderful talents!



What We Need & What You Get


For VERSIPELLIS to come to life the way we envision it we need at least $800
This project is really a huge undertaking for us and in order for it manifest our breakdown looks a little something like this:
$400= the cost of dancer/musician rehearsal salaries. Did we mention that there are original LIVE compositions, intricately choreographed pieces AND dancer/musician improvised pieces? We want nothing more than for VERSIPELLIS to be an example of how artists can be sustained by pouring their blood, sweat and tears into their creations!
It takes some hardcore studio time to orchestrate this folks... trust us!
$250= opening night theatre rental
$150= second night theatre rental

Now, as you may notice, this doesn't account for the myriad other expenses associated with a production of this caliber. Some of these things are:
Marketing materials like postcards, newspaper ads, flyers, posters and the photo shoots that have to produce the photos to go on said materials 
Costuming 
Studio rental space for rehearsals
Lighting and Sound Technicians
Travel Expenses for the cast and crew

Most of these expenses will be covered in part by our ticket sales, although many of our wonderful and talented fellow community members have donated their time and services to the project. If we exceed this funding goal we can reimburse them! YAY! Also, it will allow us to get more creative with our costuming, hair, make-up, lighting and spend more on mastering the soundtrack for higher quality recordings of the genius work of our composers! All to provide an even more awesome experience for the audience.

<h3>THE SHOW:</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Kubrilesque: or a Musical Parody with a Tease, combines burlesque with many styles of dance and talents. The beauty and talent of the performers makes Kubrilesque a cohesive piece of art and the ultimate showgirl experience. The story is a chronological parody of the 12 fims of Stanley Kubrick, while telling a story about a man making his final film.</p>
</div>
<h3>WHAT WE'RE DOING:</h3>
<p>The cast and crew of Kubrilesque have put in a lot of work, making Kubrilesque a joy to watch or to be a part of. We haven't been on tour in two years, but we've taken the time to work on a killer score and the video featured on this page. We are planning on touring the show again, with some new music starting in the Summer of 2013. We need some assistance getting the cast's travel expenses paid. That is what this fundraiser is for. All the money from this fundraiser will go directly towards planefare, gas, and travel expenses for the cast. We'll need much more than $500, but its our goal for indiegogo, just to get us started.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span>Our goal is to spread Hip Hop awareness on the UCLA campus and teach people the stylistic qualities of various aspects of Hip Hop that make it so prevalent today.

-Airfare for b-boys from Korea and around the United States
-Gas for shuttling talent between the airport, hotel, and UCLA
-Hotels for housing our performers
-Parking for dance crews and other talent
 
Of course, your help will be rewarded with some fantastic perks:
 
$50+ Swag it Up!
A ticket to the event + BreakLA Tank Top
 
$100+ The Inside Scoop!
All of the above + a BreakLA Tank with signatures from all our staff
 
$250+ Starstruck!
All of the above + a BreakLA Tank with signatures from artists of your choosing
 
$500+ Behind the Scenes!
All of the above + an exclusive invitation to the tech rehearsal of the show and a chance to meet some of the dancers and artists
 
If we somehow exceed our goal, we’d be, first of all, ecstatic(!), and secondly, promise that every bit of the money we receive from this will go to the event. Some examples are: better stage set-up (we went with the bare minimum to save on costs), gas for our volunteers to shuttle our performers from the airport, to hotels, to the event, and any other surprises/unforeseen costs (they seem to pop up every so often!)
 
The Impact
Our goal is to spread Hip Hop awareness on the UCLA campus and teach people the stylistic qualities of various aspects of Hip Hop that make it so prevalent today. Instead of reinforcing the negative stereotypes that plague the Hip Hop genre, we want to show the audience our performers’ commitment to their craft and their individuality. In addition, we wish to present Hip Hop as a viable form of expressing oneself through our various performances. 
Other Ways You Can Help
We understand that you might not be in a position to contribute financially at this time. But there are many other ways you can help us make BreakLA a success:


Spread the word to your social network on Facebook, Twitter, your school, work, neighborhood, etc.


Post flyers around your school campus, neighborhoods, dance schools, and other venues

<p><strong>What is <em>Be the Death of Me</em>?</strong></p>
<p>The Civilians, the center for investigative theater, takes its singular brand of creative investigation in a bold new direction with <em>Be the Death of Me</em>, an installation performance piece that offers the audience intimate encounters with matters of life and death in New York City. The audience will navigate their experience inside the atmospheric Irondale Center, housed in a historic church in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. Through a dynamic variety of settings and formats, the audience encounters real stories gathered from a wide cross-section of New Yorkers - everyone from ER nurses to priests, funeral directors to vampires, shamans to crime-scene cleaners. Through this myriad of perspectives, <em>Be the Death of Me</em> uncovers hidden worlds inside New York - places inhabited by those that witness the demise of our bodies, as well as those that imagine what may or may not happen to our souls on the other side of life. <em>Be the Death of Me</em> draws on months of interviews conducted by a team of Civilians' artistic volunteers.</p>
<p><strong>Who is this artistic team? </strong></p>
<p>The <em>Death</em> team is the largest ever to work on a Civilians’ production.  Over 70 writers, dramaturgs, designers, actors, and other artists have come together to create unique, two-night performance where the audience is an integral part of the work. </p>
<p>“But Civilians,” you ask, “did all these amazing artists just <em>donate</em> their time to you?!”</p>
<p>Indeed, they did!  This veritable army of artistic volunteers has contributed countless hours to interviews, transcription, creative inquiry, and other integral parts of the investigative process. <em>Be the Death of Me</em> truly would not exist without each and every one of these artists’ input - which is why we need your help! </p>
<p><strong>Support these fantastic artists!</strong></p>
<p>With a show of this magnitude, each artists’ input was invaluable.  Therefore, your gift will help us to show the artists how much we value their collaboration by enabling us to pay them even a symbolic stipend for their work.  By giving to this campaign, you will be giving directly to the over 70 individuals involved with creating <em>Death </em>and help us show our appreciation for their time, dedication, and creativity.</p>
<p>Already given? <strong>Please help us spread the word!</strong> You can share this link with family, friends, Facebook friends, and even strangers if you prefer.  Every dollar earned is another dollar going into the hands of a hard-working artist.</p>
<p><strong>Want a sneak peek?</strong></p>
<p>At the June 28 and 29 performances, audiences will each have a unique experience as they wander through the Irondale Center and experience the many distinctive personalities that our artists met with over the past six months. Here’s just a peek at some of the stories they uncovered:</p>
<p>""I liken death to a hot air balloon that there are many ropes that tether the balloon once it's full of hot air it wants to rise and leave the ground, leave the earth. But those very thick ropes leave it tethered to the ground, and sometimes those ropes are fear, sometimes they're a very strong relationship, and we think about all the threads that connect you to your mother or your sister, or your brother. You kind of have to let some of those threads go, and you actually need to receive permission from your loved ones."" <em>- Anonymous, Cancer Nurse</em></p>
<p>""Death gives everything such beautiful meaning. To live forever, you just wouldn't do anything. People already know they're going to die and they just sit around and watch television - that's death as much as anything else... I think maybe people should, periodically, have guns put to their heads.""<br/><em>- Brandon, Former Embalmer</em></p>
<p>""If you want to be buried in New York City, you need a lot of money, or a family member who already has a plot, or you just get lucky with immediate internment, otherwise you're probably going to be buried in New Jersey.""<br/><em>- Allison, Cemetery Tour Guide/Historian</em></p>

<p></p></div>","What's the BuzzMy name is Aaron Michael Krueger.  I am a performer and writer/composer living in NYC.  I began writing New Dawn as a 10 minute musical for a class my freshman year of college, and the show has grown into a full length musical since then.  My senior year of college, I was able to do a production of the show in fulfillment of my requirements for my Directing II class.  Now, after three years of rewrites and tweaks, the show is ready for another production, and has been chosen to be a part of the Midtown International Theatre Festival with direction and choreography by Lexie Fennell Frare.What We Need and What You Get For HelpingHere's what the money raised will go towards:
Festival Fees (including the Participation Fee and the Theatre Usage Fee)
Rehearsal Space
Simple Sets and Costumes
Paying the Actors, Designers, and Staff
Here's what you can get for helping us fund the project:
Downloads of Demos recorded of the music
Personalized Facebook Video Thank Yous
A Special Thank You printed in the program
Poster Signed By The Cast and Creative Team
Two Tickets to a performance of New Dawn (travel to NYC not included)
Special Access to the final rehearsal of New Dawn (travel to NYC not included)
The ImpactBesides helping me achieve one of my dreams, putting this show up is important because the show focuses on topics that are still relevant to high school students and families.  Many of the events of the musical are inspired by things I went through and felt when I was in high school.  The show raises awareness about topics that teens deal still deal with in high school.Other Ways You Can HelpJust because you can’t contribute, it doesn’t mean you can’t help:

After a sold-out & critically acclaimed
workshop production last May, also recently named as one of the Ten Best Theatre Productions for 2010, Prodigals returns for its official World
Premiere. Set in a small bar in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, six young
underachievers await the results of a murder trial that’s hit close to home.
Their world of drinking, sarcasm and missed opportunities is flipped upside
down when a former friend returns from Toronto to testify in the trial,
reopening old wounds and creating some new ones as well. Directed by Peter Boychuk, Prodigals will appear on stage in Studio T at Goldorp Centre for the Arts, SFU Woodward's, from May 3rd - May 14th, 2011



Reviews from
the workshop production:

“Minogue…
is too savvy to simply dismiss his roots. There’s an ache that runs through
this play, and it’s about the difficulty of negotiating the terrain between
adventure and compromise…[He] does an excellent job of fleshing out his
characters’ individual points of view…Minogue is a promising young writer.
Those don’t show up every day. If you run into him, buy him a beer” --Colin Thomas, Georgia Straight

“Great
writing, fabulous acting and a good omen for things to come in Canadian
theatre”--Ed Farolan, ReviewVancouver.org

“There
are usually two ways I know when a piece of theatre thoroughly sucks me in: a
total immersion into the story that blocks out the usual annoyances from my
fellow theatre-goers, or, as was the case with the Twenty Something Theatre
production of Prodigals last night, when I find myself so connected with some
of the characters that I want to scream out and provide them with what I

HOW CAN YOU HELP?:




In
order to mount the World Premiere of Prodigals

-design and construction of the set,
costumes, lighting and sound

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This production is so important to me. The characters are based on people I have met throughout high school. 'Kids These Days' focuses on the issues teenagers deal with today and how the problems we have are constantly negated by society, when in fact, they impact who we grow up to become.</p>
<p>The idea for this play found me, almost like fate. I heard about the Strawberry One Act Play Festival and wanted to participate, but I had nothing I wanted to write about. The next day, inspiration hit me right in the face. I was sitting in class having the worst day. I couldn't eat or sleep, my problems were consuming me, yet I was stuck in this classroom, like being in a prison cell. My teacher asked for my assignment and I looked at him and said I didn't have it. He shook his head and gave me the death stare as he walked away commenting on how I can’t graduate without doing my homework.  I realized that for the past 11 years of my life, school has been the most pressing issue above all others.  Even though my life seemed to be crumbling down around me, the most important and pressing issue was passing class, or handing in an algebra assignment. It seemed that for the majority of my life I was learning how to read and write but I never learned how to be happy or how to deal with my issues. So this sparked the question, what will happen once I graduate, and once those issues that were hidden behind textbooks and calculators soon become real?</p>
<p>Hence, the birth of 'Kids These Days'.</p>
<p>Let me start off by telling you a bit about me! My name is Rachel Wagner; I am going into my senior year of high school and will hopefully be attending a BFA program for acting the following year. I have been acting my entire life and decided to try my hand at writing. This is the first play I have ever written and it has been accepted into the Strawberry One-Act Festival.</p>
<p>Being a part of the festival is so important to me. I want to represent teenagers in this competition. I'll be competing with more experienced adults who probably have more money and training than I do. This is where is where YOU the donor comes in! </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The most important thing is covering the expenses that comes with putting on the production. Money is needed for rehearsal space, audition space, sets, props, and transportation. It would love to give a stipend to the actors, director and crew who will work hard for very little. It is important that the production looks polished and professional.  Plus, if you donate you get like 1,000 good karma points, so who would want to pass that up?</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This production means so much to me, and the people who have helped inspire me to write the characters. This opportunity is unbelievable and I want to make the most out of it.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>No worries, I understand that I'm not finding a cure for cancer or saving kittens so if you think your money is best suited elsewhere don't sweat it! There are plenty of other ways you can help.</p>
<ul>
<li>Spread the word! Get people interested in the production!</li>
<li>Donate props! Anything ""teen"" whether it's a stereo, a football, a pair of shoes anything that can be used in the production is greatly appreciated! For prop donations you can reach me at KidsTheseDays2012@gmail.com</li>
<li>Show support for The Strawberry One-Act Festival and the Riant Theater! They are the reason my production is possible so feel free to help them out!</li>

He shook his head and gave me the death stare as he walked away commenting on how I can’t graduate without doing my homework.  I realized that for the past 11 years of my life, school has been the most pressing issue above all others.  Even though my life seemed to be crumbling down around me, the most important and pressing issue was passing class, or handing in an algebra assignment. It seemed that for the majority of my life I was learning how to read and write but I never learned how to be happy or how to deal with my issues. So this sparked the question, what will happen once I graduate, and once those issues that were hidden behind textbooks and calculators soon become real?
Hence, the birth of 'Kids These Days'.
Let me start off by telling you a bit about me! My name is Rachel Wagner; I am going into my senior year of high school and will hopefully be attending a BFA program for acting the following year. I have been acting my entire life and decided to try my hand at writing. This is the first play I have ever written and it has been accepted into the Strawberry One-Act Festival.
Being a part of the festival is so important to me. I want to represent teenagers in this competition. I'll be competing with more experienced adults who probably have more money and training than I do. This is where is where YOU the donor comes in! 


What We Need & What You Get
The most important thing is covering the expenses that comes with putting on the production. Money is needed for rehearsal space, audition space, sets, props, and transportation. It would love to give a stipend to the actors, director and crew who will work hard for very little. It is important that the production looks polished and professional.  Plus, if you donate you get like 1,000 good karma points, so who would want to pass that up?


The Impact
This production means so much to me, and the people who have helped inspire me to write the characters. This opportunity is unbelievable and I want to make the most out of it.


Other Ways You Can Help
No worries, I understand that I'm not finding a cure for cancer or saving kittens so if you think your money is best suited elsewhere don't sweat it! There are plenty of other ways you can help.

Spread the word! Get people interested in the production!
Donate props! Anything ""teen"" whether it's a stereo, a football, a pair of shoes anything that can be used in the production is greatly appreciated! For prop donations you can reach me at KidsTheseDays2012@gmail.com
Show support for The Strawberry One-Act Festival and the Riant Theater! They are the reason my production is possible so feel free to help them out!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

IREDEA is booked for a total of 14 performances at these festivals in 2014:* Montreal Festival Acces Asie, May 3 & 4 Click Here (Tickets 17.50$ – Box office: (514) 861-4036. Espace Aline-Letendre, Église du Gesù, 1202 rue Bleury.)* Montreal Fringe Festival, June 12-22* Ottawa Fringe Festival, June 20 - 30HOW YOUR SUPPORT WILL IMPACT OUR PROJECTWe have been developing the work for this sci-fi dance rock since 2011. The total cost of creating and producing this show up to the end of our 2014 Summer tour is approximately $20,000.  Much of Iredea has been created from our own pockets.  Before launching for public audiences in less than 2 months, we are in need of financial support in this final stretch. We are trying to raise $4000 from our Indigogo supportors and another $4000 from corporate sponsors. The balance of the budget is being invested by us the artists.These funds will be used primarily to pay our team of artists who are working tirelessly on the show. Other expenses also include: press & promotion costs, festival fees, touring costs, and additional materials and props. Your contribution will help us get through the final and most challenging stage of the show creation before it is brought to audiences for the first time.  This initial series of performances in 2014 will greatly serve as a launching pad for Iredea to be seen and picked up by producers throughout the world. Our vision is too continue to develop this work to its full artistic potential over the next 5 years. It is our goal to perform and tour this work in all parts of the world and inspire audiences from all walks of life.  Woo Me Myth is a dance rock opera company based in Montreal, Quebec created by musician Ted Strauss & contemporary dancer Jenn Doan in 2009.  We started the company in 2009 out of a shared passion to deliver a new performance language that is both evocative and awe-inspiring for all audiences. Together we create the sonic and physical landscape for every live performance, merging together mythology, striking contemporary dance, and the eclectic sounds of electronic and rock music. 
Our first full production in 2010, The Duck Wife,  toured across Canada with a 4 member rock band, an ensemble of 5 dancers and actors, and a production manager. An incredibly ambitious undertaking for us two young artists with a big vision. The show received much audience acclaim and won several awards along the way. The Montreal Gazette reviewed, ""The Duck Wife is a revelation.""
This incredible Duck Wife experience affirmed to us that we were on to something. This is what we love to do... to create, to collaborate, and to perform. 
The development of Iredea began in the fall of 2011 when we set out to find the inspiration for our next creation. Woo Me Myth’s vision has always been rooted in mythology. Science fiction, a mythology for the modern world, became the centre of our fascination.

For 2 years, we experimented and delved into research of cinema, history, art, and movement in the dance studio. These were the seeds that would become Iredea.  After performing in the 2013 Festival Vue Sur La Releve in Montreal, we were awarded an artist’s residency at Le Gesu arts centre, and an offer to present in the 2014 Festival Acces Asie. Starting in September 2013, we began to assemble a team of incredibly talented collaborators from all artistic disciplines to finally take this vision to the next level. Please help us bring this sci-fi dance rock to life!   THE IREDEA TEAMTed Strauss, artistic director, composerJenn Doan, choreographic director, dancerDancersMelina StinsonMark MedranoMaxine SegalowitzKarston KrollCreative teamSandra Chirico, costume designerClement Yeh, prop designer Tristan Brand, photographer Scott Combes, visual artist Marigold Santos, visual artist Josee Gagnon, performance mentorKaie Kellough, writer and sound poetMaria Simone, rehearsal directorProduction teamMohamed Hamad, web and social mediaChristine Kinsella, booking agent Khosro Berahmandi, Festival Director of Access Asie Le GesuOur job description looks something like this: dreaming, researching, discussing, rehearsing 4-6x per week, directing, reading, physical training, writing, planning, composing original music, writing narration, producing, arguing, organizing, scheduling, more thinking, more planning, making errors, making corrections, meeting with collaborators, more dreaming, learning, stressing, contacting press, more meetings, a little more arguing, a lot more stressing, more rehearsing, fundraising, photo shooting, video shooting, editing videos, editing pictures, social media posting, hustling, thinking, planning, losing sleep, promoting, performing, more promoting, and then more and more and more performing!!!",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

currently a stigma around issues concerning mental wellness in Canada even
though roughly 1 in every 4 people will be diagnosed with some form of mental
health issue within their lifetime.  Approximately 1 in every 100 people
are Schizophrenic.  For this community it is important to tell the stories
of those whose lives have been touched by Schizophrenia in order to open up a
dialogue about the condition, and to reduce the stigma that interferes with
integration and acceptance of those with this illness.  We are

the workshop in London and transport one individual there than to pay for two
individuals to fly back to Canada.  We realize that this is a large
expense, but we wouldn’t undertake this international workshop if we didn’t
feel that the specific individuals involved were not essential to creating the
best possible play we could create at this point in time. While this workshop

<p></p></div>","The Project:






you & i Theatre is a collaborative creation based company
headed by Co-Artistic Directors Kevin Kraussler and Ming Hudson.  Our
mandate is to create works of physical theatre that promote social change.

The Elephant and The
Goldfish is a new Theatre for Young Audiences play in development
with initial dramaturgy by Jan Derbyshire.  This is a physical theatre
piece that requires highly stylized and acrobatic movement.  To further
develop the physical components of this creation, we will be conducting our
second development workshop in October of 2013.
With this work we, at you & i Theatre, are
interested in exploring the narrative of an actor who needs to play the part of
an individual who has schizophrenia, and so seeks out the first hand experience
of a young woman who has been institutionalized.  This begins an adventure
through friendship and delusion that takes the viewer on an expressionistic
journey through the mind of the protagonist.  Our primary goal is to ask:
What is “normal” and who decides what “normal” is?  
One of our company members was raised in a household with a
Schizophrenic parent, which was the impetus for this project.  There is
currently a stigma around issues concerning mental wellness in Canada even
though roughly 1 in every 4 people will be diagnosed with some form of mental
health issue within their lifetime.  Approximately 1 in every 100 people
are Schizophrenic.  For this community it is important to tell the stories
of those whose lives have been touched by Schizophrenia in order to open up a
dialogue about the condition, and to reduce the stigma that interferes with
integration and acceptance of those with this illness.  We are
specifically targeting this play to junior high/ high school age young
audiences. 
The person we have chosen to be our dramaturg and director as we
move forward with this project is renowned Canadian Director/Actor/Dramturg Jack
Paterson.  Paterson is the perfect fit for our project because of his long
standing history of artistic achievement, as well as his extensive experience
with Theatre for Young Audiences.  However, Paterson is currently pursuing
his MFA at the prestigious East 15 Acting School at the University of Essex.
 In addition, Hudson is also currently living in the UK, attending the
London International School of the Performing Arts obtaining a diploma in
physical theatre and creation.  
To meet our staged production goal of 2016, we feel that it is
crucial to have a development workshop this year.  With two thirds of our
creative team currently located in London, it is most cost effective to have
the workshop in London and transport one individual there than to pay for two
individuals to fly back to Canada.  We realize that this is a large
expense, but we wouldn’t undertake this international workshop if we didn’t
feel that the specific individuals involved were not essential to creating the
best possible play we could create at this point in time. While this workshop
will take place in England, we are committed to using Canadian artists to
create a uniquely Canadian play.   
Any contribution you can make will help us get to London and
continue this important work! 


What We Need:


We are hoping to raise $2500.  This would cover:




Travel costs for Kevin to get to London


Payment for the Artists



If we exceed our fundraising goal, the extra money would go
towards the creation of a company website to promote the show and attract
further funding.

<h3>We're raising money to get our new show ""Digger"" off the ground.</h3>
<p>Hi friends! Mike, Alissa, Brian and Joemca from <a href=""http://www.inkfishart.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Inkfish</strong></a> here. Great news: we've been invited to travel to Minnesota for a few weeks to work on our new show <em><strong>Digger.</strong></em> The wonderful people at Lanesboro Arts Center <strong><a href=""http://www.lanesboroarts.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.lanesboroarts.org/</a></strong> have invited us to their facilities this spring for an artist's residency and we can't wait to get started.</p>
<p><strong>About the show: </strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Digger</strong></em> is about holes, and man’s descent into chaos. It ponders literal holes – black holes, holes dug through the earth, bullet holes, holes in bodies, wormholes, and spillways –in combination with Dante’s Inferno –the ultimate descent into a hole. The production concept was initially inspired by the media surrounding the Chilean mine collapse in 2010. When watching the coverage of the collapse, We were struck by similarities between the San Esteban mine and historical interpretations of Dante’s Inferno: the miners were trapped in an extended state of limbo (first circle of hell), and the structure of the San Esteban mine is uncannily similar to early artists’ interpretations that map Dante’s hell. Our narrative will draw on the miner’s experiences, Dante’s Inferno, and personal experiences to tell a story of the human struggles with lust, gluttony, greed, anger, heresy, violence and treachery.</p>

<h3>Please help me get to the WPIC Conference in Stockholm, Sweden, this summer</h3>
<p>Hi, I am Angelina Llongueras, a theater artist from Barcelona,  Catalonia, Spain, relocated to San Francisco, CA. I am an actress, a playwright, a stage director and a theatre arts researcher and professor.</p>
<p>After a long selection process, my one woman show ""<em>Phoolan is Everyone</em>"" has been invited to be part of WPIC (Women Playwright's International Conference) to be celebrated in Sweden this summer.</p>
<p>Being able to attend this conference is a great opportunity for this play and for me as a playwright, as it will  open doors and give me the necessary back up to help my plays be produced. Being a woman playwright with no ""big contacts"" and a penchant for social justice theatrical themes, this is the best opportunity I may have to advance my playwrighting career.</p>
<p>For more than 25 years, I have created many independent shows dealing with silenced individuals and cultures, with my own resources exclusively, and have brought them to many stages in the world, so as to preserve the kind of stories that tend to be ""erased"" from collective memory, or distorted. In 2004 I created in Barcelona, and premiered in Ecuador my ""<em>Phoolan is Everyone</em>"", thinking that Phoolan Devi, the strong Indian woman whose life and legacy it explains, would be a good role model for young Ecuadorian girls to learn from. I have brought it to many alternative theatres and cultural centers in Europe, the Americas and the US. In November 2010 it was invited for participation in the  prestigious Bogotá and Cali Women Theatre Festivals in Colombia.</p>
<p>Due to the ""cuts"" in the arts and education, in spite of my ongoing dedication to theatre in all its forms, these last years I have had to survive by getting my income from an array of non-artistic jobs. I barely cover my expenses and have no extra money to allow me to go on a trip like the one I have been invited to. I tried to obtain travel grants for artists from ""normal"" venues, and discovered that most of them have also been ""cut"" and there are practically no funds for supporting people like me.</p>
<p>I need $ 3,000 to cover the plane ticket and the costs of my stay there . I am trying to get cheap plane tickets with one stop on the way, and if I get the money in June,  there will be some time left to find this kind of tickets.</p>
<p>Aside from the perks I am offering, I will make sure to send a weekly THANK YOU  email with the updated list of donors to all of you.</p>

<p>Debido a los ""recortes"" en las artes y la educación, a pesar de mi contínua dedicación al teatro en todas sus variantes, estos últimos años he tenido que sobrevivir obteniendo mis ingresos de un serie de empleos no artísticos.

<h3>I am a choreographer, video artist and singer/songwriter, living in Oakland, CA. I recently moved from Brooklyn, New York to expand my individual experience.  I majored in Dance and Literature at The New School University.  </h3>
<p>Recently, I have been working on a film and dance piece, titled 'Subject to Change'. This is a film with a live dance component, exploring perception. Prying into the subconscious and conscious mind, I ask: 'Why do we see what we see?' The music explores sound and senses. I collaborated with the very talented Electronic DJ, Jason Snell, who worked like Magic to thread together sensory music.</p>
<p> It is a part of The ODC Pilot 62 Program in San Francisco, shown alongside five talented choreographers and film artists in the Bay Area. We are all working together to premier a nights work, titled 'Kinetoscope...This Time With Pictures' on March 22 &amp; 23.</p>
<p> This process has been mentored by renowned Los Angeles based filmmaker, video artist and choreographer, Cari Ann Shim Sham*. This program is designed for emerging choreographers.  The theme is Dance for Camera. Pilot is known for it's slogan 'pulling it together by your own bootstraps', working as a collective. The artists simultaneously make work, while dividing roles (PR, Social Media, Box Office, Programs, Reception etc.) to put up an evening of new work. That being said, this is why I need your help.</p>
<p>During this process, I have found an exciting creative voice combining these two elements of dance and video. However, as I open into my process and new work, I am in need of financial support. Production for this piece has taken more time and money than expected. So far, I've spent more than 300 dollars on rehearsal, travel, computer programs and equipment. Now, I really need help to pay for rehearsal space and production (costume and set). I would love for that to even be a possibility! I would love to  pay the very talented performer Ashley Trottier for her dedication and hard work to this piece. </p>
<h3>Help me make this piece all it can be and more. Contribute anything you can, even one dollar counts. If you cannot give at this time, help spread the word to friends and family that may be able to.</h3>
<h3>I believe in the power of art. Expression is a courageous act that can transform the individual and community, even on a subtle level. We must keep art and performance alive. Support this work, help it breath. </h3>

<p><strong>About Me:</strong></p>
<p>My name is Uma Shannon and I am a dancer from Amherst, MA. I began dancing at East Street Dance Center in Amherst, MA in the fall of 2009 at the age of 13. Although some would say I started dance late, I know I am in good company since dancers such as Martha Graham, Rudolf Nureyev, and José Limón also started in their teens as well.</p>
<p>I study and enjoy ballet, character, modern, contemporary, and flamenco. I have had the good fortune to train with Irina Vakhromeeva, Andre Reyes, Claire Maurey, Tai Jimenez, Tekla Kostek, Onalie Arts and Ines Arrubla among others.</p>
<p><strong>The Goal:</strong></p>
<p>In February, I auditioned and was accepted to the Gelsey Kirkland Academy of Classical Ballet’s 2013 Summer Intensive which I will be attending for three weeks. Attending this program is a dream come true.</p>
<p>My goal is to raise $5,000 through this campaign to cover the costs of tuition, room and partial board in New York City, plus other related costs such as travel, lunches, and program activities that are not covered by tuition. I am one of five children and while my parents do their utmost to support all of us in our numerous endeavors, money is very tight.</p>
<p><strong>My Past Experiences:</strong></p>
<p>My performance experience includes such classics as Don Quixote, The Nutcracker, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Maeterlinck"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Maurice Maeterlinck"">Maurice Maeterlinck</a>’s “The Bluebird of Happiness”, and Paquita. Along with my ballet experience I have danced in a number of original contemporary works. Recently I joined dancer/choreographer Claire Maurey’s contemporary dance company, The Movery, located in the Pioneer Valley of Western Massachusetts.</p>
<p>I support my dance training with work study at my ballet school, and working as an assistant instructor in the pre-ballet classes.</p>
<p><strong>How You Can Help:</strong></p>

<p>I really appreciate any support you can provide and thank you for taking an interest in my hopes and dreams to take this next important step forward in my dance career. I look forward to expanding my knowledge and experience as a dancer this summer at Gelsey Kirkland’s Academy of Classical Ballet.</p>

<p><em>Berlin International Youth Theatre (BIYT) is a <strong>MAGICAL MIXTURE </strong>of young people ages 12-17, from different countries, cultures, ages, and schools coming together to develop acting skills, <strong>BUILD SELF ESTEEM</strong>, work together as an ensemble, and <strong>MAKE NEW FRIENDS</strong>. All of this hard work is channeled into the creation of a yearly <strong>LIVE PERFORMANCE</strong> in a professional theatre in the heart of Berlin.</em></p>
<p>What makes BIYT so unique is that classes are taught and performances are supported by <strong>PROFESSIONAL THEATRE ARTISTS</strong>, often volunteering their time to bring the highest quality theatrical experience to international youth in Berlin. At the same time, through our <strong>DIVERSE PARTICIPANTS</strong>, we provide a platform for social exchange between different cultures, promoting communication and understanding in the global language of English.</p>
<p>You see, our goal at BIYT is not only to provide <strong>OUTSTANDING THEATRE EDUCATION</strong> but also to present high quality original performances for families that are both entertaining and thought provoking. Our work is a <strong>COLLABORATION </strong>between the imagination and energy of the youth we serve, the professional theatre artists who support them, and the international heritage of the city where we reside.</p>
<p>Like all collaborations, BIYT needs the help of others to bring magic to the stage—<strong>YOU CAN MAKE AN IMMEDIATE AND SIGNIFICANT IMPACT</strong> with your support today!</p>
<p><em><strong>OUR PROJECT</strong></em></p>
<p>After months of training, devising, writing, and—let’s face it—having a ton of fun, our yearly original production is beginning to come to life! The students of BIYT are once again tackling difficult issues through theatre with the world premiere of <strong>MODELMONSTERMODEL-</strong><strong> </strong><strong><em>The Curse of Narcissus!</em></strong></p>
<p><em>“</em><em>Bombarded by the media with images of retouched and impossible beauty, these images begin to shape our understandings of reality and the world, including the identities of its people and places.” –Priscilla Bergey, Director</em></p>
<p>Through in-depth group <strong>DISCUSSION</strong>, individual <strong>RESEARCH</strong>, and community <strong>INTERVIEWS</strong>, the participants of BIYT have created theme for an original theatrical experience that explores issues of <strong>BODY IMAGE</strong> and is inspired by the ancient Greek myth of Narcissus. <strong>MODELMONSTERMODEL-</strong><strong> </strong><strong><em>The Curse of Narcissus </em></strong>is a play that encourages an appreciation of our own beauty, which so often has been wounded and undervalued by the images we see in the media. This <strong>ENSEMBLE CREATED WORK</strong> will be devised and performed by the young participants of BIYT.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">We must raise <strong>3000€</strong> before opening night to bring <em>ModelMonsterModel: The Curse of Narcissus</em> to life and <strong>WE NEED YOUR HELP </strong>to reach our goal!</span></p>
<p><em><strong>WHAT YOUR GIFT WILL FUND</strong></em></p>
<p>BIYT families pay a small monthly fee to participate in our weekly workshops where they train in and create performance, lead by professional theatre artists. Workshops begin in the fall and culminate with our original production in late spring. In order to keep this monthly cost low, we utilize the generosity of the Berlin theatrical community who donates our rehearsal and performance space. In addition, many of our professional teaching artists and support staff volunteer their time and talents without pay. Even with this outpouring of practical support, the money we earn does not begin to cover the cost of bringing our yearly vision to the stage for the young people of BIYT.</p>
<p>With your help, the money we raise before opening night will go to fund production essentials such as lighting and sound designers and operators, costumes and sets for our performers, a choreographer, and a stage manager, to mention only a few budget items. While so many of the BIYT staff volunteer their time without pay, those few professionals we hire to support our productions work well below industry standards for to hep us bring to the stage what our participants have created.</p>
<p>It doesn’t have to cost a king’s ransom to fund a quality production, but it does need funding. For instance, a donation of 25€ will fund the creation of 1-2 costumes for a performer and for our production of <em>ModelMonsterModel: The Curse of Narcissus</em> and in this production, we need to build 40 costumes! Of course, <strong>A DONATION OF ANY SIZE</strong> helps us get that much closer to our goal, but for your generosity at the following amounts, we have some special gifts to say “<strong>THANK YOU!</strong>”:</p>
<p>For your donation<strong>*</strong> of <strong>25€,</strong> you will receive one ticket to any performance of ModelMonsterModel: The Curse of Narcissus! </p>
<p>For your donation<strong>*</strong> of <strong>50€,</strong> you will receive our popular and stylish BIYT Logo Canvas Shopping Tote! </p>
<p>For your donation<strong>*</strong> of <strong>100€,</strong> you will receive a DVD of our spring production, ModelMonsterModel: The Curse of Narcissus! </p>
<p><strong>*</strong>Berlin International Youth Theatre is in the process of seeking non-profit status as an organization. We're not there yet! Unfortunately this means that your gift this year is NOT tax-deductible, but the good karma it will bring you is priceless!</p>
<p><em><strong>WHY YOUR GIFT MATTERS</strong></em></p>
<p>Since 2010, Berlin International Youth Theatre has brought <strong>QUALITY THEATRE EDUCATION </strong>to English speaking youth in Berlin. With your gift this year, you will be supporting our fourth original World Premiere production, written and created by the young people of BIYT. Many of our families have grown up participating in Berlin International Youth Theatre and we are constantly looking for new ways to engage the community in a <strong>MEANINGFUL AND LASTING</strong> way.
