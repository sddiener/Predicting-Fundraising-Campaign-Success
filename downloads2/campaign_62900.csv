The Impact
Gloria is a mother of 4 and has a career in the medical field. Since this struggle began last year she has not worked and missed out on lots of good time with her children. When you make a donation you will be helping Gloria pay for some of these medical bills that are pilling and living expenses also. If this benefit doesn’t succeed who knows what road lies ahead. She could lose a house that she has worked so hard for and maybe even her vehicle. No doubt in my mind she would do the same for someone else in her position unacceptable.

<p>The Museum of History and Industry in Seattle, in
conjunction with the opening of their Bezos Center for Innovation, recently
held a Napkin Sketch contest. This contest invited the public to sketch an
innovative invention on a napkin and tweet a picture of it with the hashtag
#innovationMOHAI. Out of the 30 entries of innovative ideas, SoleMate was
selected as a runner up. </p><h3>The Digital Device</h3>
<p>The idea was created while shopping at a big box store in 2005.   I found
myself with a two year old screaming, who didn't want to try on shoes
anymore.  I was a tired mom just wanting
to get the right fit and get out of the store! 
I thought, why cant they just invent something my son could just stand on.    Something that could tell me his general shoe size, in a digital format with US and Euro
sizes.</p>
<p>In our research, we found that a child 1-6 years old,
grows a shoe size every 1-2 months, ages 6-10 years old growths every 2-3 months and ages
10-12 years old every 3-4 months. The Sole Mate would help assist parents and take the
guess work out of the children’s shoe sizing. 
Besides the children's foot, your adult foot changes over time.  The SoleMate calculates both children and
adults shoe sizes.   Getting the correct fit is our priority with the creation of SoleMate.<br/></p><p></p><h2></h2><p></p><h3>Patent Pending Status</h3>

Her love of others and desire to heal and re-energize people drives her to give back with as much of herself as she is able.  Amy is also a cancer survivor, mother, and wife; these aspects of her journey have pushed her compassion to a  whole new level and have lead her to explore new healing arts on her path to Zen Den.What we will offer:Part of what makes Zen Den so special is that it will be a collaborative studio filled with the love, light, and knowledge of many different wellness and self care artists and professionals!  We are excited to welcome friends and fellow community members to join our network and share our space as their paths cross ours with common goals and related skill sets! Some of the amazing services that we'll be offering are:

My story
I'm a 28 year old documentary filmmaker. I live in Paris, France, but my family lives in the US. After accomplishing my first feature documentary, I needed to rest, and went to India for a while.There, I met the Cottolengo Brothers. Travelling from town to town, I eventually landed in Kochi and fell in love with it. I was invited to have dinner with Dr. Maliyakal and the brothers. It was the beginning of a friendship and they soon brought me to the Little House of Providence.It wasn't easy to find a way to help them. But we found a camera and I was able to shoot this little video. I sincerely hope it will reach enough people to raise the money. When I'm able to put aside a little money I will go back there and show you the benefits of your generosity myself.
Help us!
You can make this possible! Please tell your friends, share the project as much as possible, we can't make it without you!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</b><p><b>Short
Summary</b></p>
<p><b><i>Background</i></b></p>
<p>Christians and other
minorities in Iraq are being persecuted, murdered, made slaves, and driven from
the homes they have occupied since the early Christian communities were formed
by the Apostles after the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ.<span>  Throughout history, many Christians were
persecuted and became martyrs as they defended their faith, laying down their
lives for the love of Jesus Christ. 
History is now repeating itself as the <b><i>Islamic State of Iraq and Syria
(“ISIS” or the “Islamic State”) is making martyrs of the descendents of early
Christian communities</i></b> as well as other innocent religious minorities
for the only reason of not thinking exactly the same as them.  The world now watches in horror as Christian
are being decapitated, crucified, women raped and made slaves, with the
children also being raped and decapitated. 
The Islamic State has forced <b><i>more than 1.2 million Christians, Yazidis,
and Shia Muslims from their homes in Iraq, under threat of death or heavy fines
if they do not convert</i></b>. <a href=""#_ftn1"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span><span>[1]</span></span></span></a></span>  </p>
<p>The international
community has only started to implement a strategy to stop ISIS before their
actions become genocide.<span>  In the mean
time many Christians, including Catholics, ask themselves what they can do to
help those persecuted Christians brothers and sisters and other religious
minorities in Iraq beyond intensifying their prayers for them.  <b><i>Pope Francis has given $1 million as a
personal contribution</i></b> to help Christians and other religious minorities
in Iraq who have been forced from their homes.<a href=""#_ftn2"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span><span>[2]</span></span></span></a>  Other Catholic organizations have also <b><i>raised

<p>The question is then,
how can common lay people of good faith throughout the world help these martyr
communities in Iraq with something more than their valuable prayers?<span>  Knowing that faith without works is dead
(James 2:26), the answer is with their pocket, by contributing funds to be used
for relief efforts for these communities. 
But, then the next question comes up: 
How can individuals contribute funds given their limited economic
condition where they live and how can they send these funds to aid our
Christian brothers and Sisters as well as other religious minorities in
Iraq?  The answer is to <b><i>contribute
to the Relief Fund for Christians and Other Minorities in Iraq, </i></b>with an
aim to raise at least <b><i>$1 million</i></b>, net of fund raising fees
and perk costs. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>This
campaign is a joint effort of La Filotea Productions, Inc., a lay Catholic
organization, and two Catholic religious orders, the Order of the Most Holy

<p><i>“A few days ago I gave Father Amir $2000 from your donations

are 150 children every day at the center.<span> 
</span></i></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>Father Amir gave the funds to the sister in charge and her
face lit up, saying ‘Father, you do not know how much we need this. We did not have any funds left to buy milk for
tomorrow!”</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>Our Lord Jesus Christ tells us ""And whoever gives to
one of these little ones even a cup of cold water because he is a disciple,
truly, I say to you, he shall not lose his reward."" (Mathew 30, 11). God pays us for every good deed we do!</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>So in the midst of the pain from this senseless violence, we
rejoice in those children who had milk thanks to you, and we are glad for you
because you will not go unrewarded.</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>God bless you!</i></p>

&amp; Challenges</b>
<p>If
we are successful in this campaign, it will be for the Glory of God.<span>  If we fail, it will be for our
humiliation.  In either case, it will be
good for us. However, we are undertaking
this campaign as we hear in our hearts the call from God to do so.  We have done our part, now it is up to our
God to do His.  The work depends on us,
the results depend on Him.  Glory be to
the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, Amen.</span></p>
<p>We

success.  If we come short of our goal,
we will still use the funds for humanitarian aid for the benefit of persecuted Christians
and other religious minorities in Iraq. 
If we exceed our goals, we will consider distributing extra funds for
other persecuted brothers and sisters in Christ in Syria.  It is now all up to God.  </span></p>

</p>
<p>See the video!  Our team consists of myself, Kathy
McCay, a medical knowledgebase writer with a degree in social work/psychology,
two physicians, an environmental biologist, and an attorney. 
We care profoundly about preventing or reducing the onset of diseases that have
typically been called ""age-related""  -- diseases which can often
be prevented.  In fact, diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, dementia,
and many types of cancer have been shown to be directly related (either in
onset or progression) to toxins in our food and environment, as well as
stress. It appears that the word is not out! </p>
<p>In case you haven't heard the argument of “wellness” vs “maintenance”
– some physicians dispense medications to treat symptoms and others are
into PREVENTION of disease; we fall into the latter camp.</p>
<p>We also know that the ""baby boomer"" market for affordable Continuing Care Retirement Communities (CCRCs) is huge.  Our idea was born out philanthropy, but will also cater to the financial sense of the investor who understands how unprepared the United States is for baby boomer care.  In Houston, Texas, for example, there is a 39% increase predicted in folks over 65 by the year 2030.  It's huge.</p>
<p>We would like to set up two programs
in Houston, Texas, to boost awareness, provide services, and actually
provide verifiable data to the national medical community. Both programs
will become self-sustaining. One would be a  ""field project"" -
which would be a small ""country setting"" continuing care retirement
community of under 75 lucky folks.<span>  These
will be mostly independent living folks (before onset of disease). The second
program will be an ""in your home"" service for folks over 55. 
This service would provide meals for ""boosting brain health,"" some
custodial care, and environment helps to people in their own homes.  Both
programs would employ all of our medically-substantiated wellness techniques.  They are simple techniques to remove as
many toxins from our environment as possible and nurture the human body and
brain.  You've probably read about

</ul></div>","Short Summary 

See the video!  Our team consists of myself, Kathy
McCay, a medical knowledgebase writer with a degree in social work/psychology,
two physicians, an environmental biologist, and an attorney. 
We care profoundly about preventing or reducing the onset of diseases that have
typically been called ""age-related""  -- diseases which can often
be prevented.  In fact, diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, dementia,
and many types of cancer have been shown to be directly related (either in
onset or progression) to toxins in our food and environment, as well as
stress. It appears that the word is not out! 
In case you haven't heard the argument of “wellness” vs “maintenance”
– some physicians dispense medications to treat symptoms and others are
into PREVENTION of disease; we fall into the latter camp.
We also know that the ""baby boomer"" market for affordable Continuing Care Retirement Communities (CCRCs) is huge.  Our idea was born out philanthropy, but will also cater to the financial sense of the investor who understands how unprepared the United States is for baby boomer care.  In Houston, Texas, for example, there is a 39% increase predicted in folks over 65 by the year 2030.  It's huge.
We would like to set up two programs
in Houston, Texas, to boost awareness, provide services, and actually
provide verifiable data to the national medical community. Both programs
will become self-sustaining. One would be a  ""field project"" -
which would be a small ""country setting"" continuing care retirement
community of under 75 lucky folks.  These
will be mostly independent living folks (before onset of disease). The second
program will be an ""in your home"" service for folks over 55. 
This service would provide meals for ""boosting brain health,"" some
custodial care, and environment helps to people in their own homes.  Both
programs would employ all of our medically-substantiated wellness techniques.  They are simple techniques to remove as
many toxins from our environment as possible and nurture the human body and
brain.  You've probably read about 
few of these items, but just like the rest of us, you are not sure what
is important, or where to start, or what to recommend to your own
parents.  You might also worry about “what you missed.”  Our goal is to help folks not miss anything!
As a contributor, you would be
helping to set up a grass-roots facility and services that will not only help

Risks

All of the numbers on baby boomers

We are not dependent on Medicare or Obama’s Affordable

If our marketing fails, baby boomers won't see the need
     for Wellness Living.

<p><strong>Whiteknights Muggle Quidditch Tournament</strong></p>
<em><strong><br/>Our Goal</strong></em>
<p>We are the <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/Reading-Rocs-Quidditch-Team/130199067122592?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Reading Rocs</a> Quidditch team. All of our team members are students at the University of Reading. We have started this project as we intend to host England's first ever Quidditch Tournament, <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/events/152009238297151/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Whiteknights Tournament</a>, held in Reading on the 22nd and 23rd of June. As Quidditch is a relatively new sport to the United Kingdom, we receive no funding from the Students' Union or other official bodies. As a result, we rely entirely upon donations and fund-raising to fund all of our activities.</p>
<p>Whiteknights Tournament will bring Quidditch teams from all over the UK together to compete over two days to be named the UK's best. Of the 20 UK teams in existence, 6 are currently signed up to attend our tournament, making Whiteknights the biggest ever held in the UK to date. For many it will be the chance to prove themselves to the country, or to settle rivalries from previous matches.</p>
<p>This project is particularly important to Reading Rocs as a team because this is our first opportunity to take on the best teams in the UK all together, and it gives us the chance to have Quidditch officially recognised by our Students' Union. By hosting this tournament we will gain more local recognition and experience as a team and have our chance to show that we can be one of the best teams in the UK.</p>
<p><em><strong>What exactly is Quidditch?</strong></em></p>
<p>Quidditch originated in the Harry Potter Books written by J.K. Rowling. The sport, as we play it, was created in 2005 at Middlebury College in Vermont. Each team is made up of 7 players on broomsticks: 3 chasers, 2 beaters, 1 keeper and 1 seeker. The chasers work together to get the Quaffle through one of three hoops at the opposite end of the pitch. The beaters throw the Bludgers at the opposing team to make them lose possession and results in the opponent having to run back to their own set of hoops. The keeper defends the hoops. The seeker is responsible for pursuing the Snitch, wherever it may go.<br/><br/>Quidditch is a full contact sport played with mixed teams on broomsticks. 1 Quaffle, 3 Bludgers and 1 Snitch are used during the game. The Snitch is carried by the Snitch Runner, who can run off the pitch, play tricks on the players and generally cause mayhem.<br/><br/>There are over 300 teams in the USA and already 20 in the UK. Quidditch is flourishing as a sport with many, both young and old, jumping at the chance to pick up a broom and play. </p>
<h2><em><strong>The Funds Breakdown</strong></em></h2>
<p>We require funding because we receive no funds from the Students' Union. We have been fund-raising ourselves but it would be impossible for us to raise the funds needed without outside help.</p>
<p>We will be spending the funds on:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First Aid cover for the event</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pitch Hire</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New equipment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Awards for the winners of the Tournament</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p> Our target is to raise a minimum of £300 but ideally we need at least £600 to have all the basics covered. Any money raised over our target will be spent on ensuring the Teams have a safe and fun time. We have already prepared the majority of the Tournament, we just need the funds to finalise everything.</p>
<p>Quidditch is only small at present but we hope that one day it will grow to be a recognised sport. We want to play our part to make this happen, but we need your help to get us there. Please sponsor us today!</p>

</p><p>(Desplácese hacia abajo para vea la versión en español)<br/></p><p><b>The Problem</b></p>
<p>Not all doctors in Mexico undergo
medical residency programs after completing medical school. As a result, in
many rural areas, doctors are not always trained to properly handle some
situations. Patients in need are sometimes very far from a doctor with proper
training and do not have the time nor money to reach these doctors. Closing
these gaps in medical education would help save more lives, especially in
emergencies and during childbirth.</p>
<p>In the US and Canada, shifting
demographics reveal that communicating in Spanish has become a necessity in
many professional spheres. Nowhere is this more important than in the
healthcare industry. Communicating effectively when discussing issues of health
is a skill that is not just recommended, it must be emphasized continuously so
that Spanish-speaking patients are not marginalized.</p>
<p><b>PACE MD</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>PACE MD was the first social impact
organization in Mexico to address particular gaps in Mexican health care skills
and services. It is staffed 100% by Mexican citizens, and has a network of
hundreds of certified medical instructors. In Mexico, the PACEMD program
seeks to improve medical care in areas where mortality rates are high.</p>
<p>PACE MD has pioneered different courses in
Latin America to provide doctors improved knowledge, skills, and abilities.
These include:</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p><p>-  Basic and Advanced Life Support for Obstetrics courses- decreasing the maternal mortality rate in southern Mexico. </p><p>-  Basic and Advanced Cardiovascular and Pediatric Life Support courses</p><p>-  National Association of EMT courses</p><p>-  PACE SONO Emergency Ultrasound Courses</p><p>-  Technical Conference on  Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner programs</p><p>-  International Federation of Emergency Medicine Conferences in Latin America</p><p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Building from the success of these
programs, PACE MD is also developing a training academy and fostering
partnerships that will give this post-doctorate model of education a greater
reach throughout Mexico and Latin America. These programs seek to include,
rather than exclude, as many interested parties as possible in the context of
improved education for health professionals. Other programs being developed by
PACE MD include Spanish language access to the MedChallenger online database,
and the University of New Mexico ECHO Program.</span><br/></p>
<p><b>PACE MedSpanish Program</b></p>
<p>The PACE MedSpanish Program is a
language and cultural immersion program specifically designed for pre-med and
medical students, nurses, paramedics, residents, physicians, emergency and
general medical personnel, and any other medical professionals interacting with
Spanish speaking patients.  Over
the course of 1-4 weeks, students obtain cultural knowledge and skills which
refine their abilities when communicating with Spanish speaking patients at
home. It was founded in the state of Guanajuato (GTO), Mexico and operates in
Guanajuato City (GTO), San Miguel de Allende (GTO), Oaxaca City, Oaxaca (OX),
and San Cristobal de Las Casas, Chiapas (CH). </p>
<p>The exposure PACE MedSpanish provides
students to clinics, hospitals, rural brigades, and ambulatory services almost
universally sparks a greater interest in global health. The potential that
these networks reach with increased exposure and commitment to impact-driven initiatives
is very powerful. These Global health providers often help PACE develop new
training models to apply in developing conditions. </p>
<p>PACE MedSpanish is unique because no
other Medical Spanish program in America or Latin America offers multi-week immersion
rotations in medical settings. By granting access to hospitals,
clinics, and the Red Cross, this service speeds up and enhances the
practitioner’s learning experience. This learning model is scalable and
currently available at the four different destination points mentioned above,
each with their own vibrant indigenous populations. </p>

<p><b>Impact</b></p>
<p><u>PACEMD</u></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>PACEMD was the
first social impact organization in Latin America to address “<a href=""http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/CPRAndECC/WhatisCPR/AboutUs/Chain-of-Survival_UCM_307516_Article.jsp"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">chain of survival”</a> gaps in the Mexican health care system with competency based
training for providers and systems</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>By January 2014
PACE MD will have trained 15,000+ health care providers through its certification courses</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>The ALSO course
alone has trained 8,000 doctors </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Overall
enrollment in ALSO has increased by 66% from 2011-13</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>We are
initiating an “Obstetrical First Responder “ course for traditional midwives in
Chiapas in 2014</p>
<p><u>PACE MedSpanish</u></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Impacted 400+
visiting students in the states of Guanajuato, Oaxaca, and Chiapas </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>This model of
immersion, gained by nurturing a bilateral training relationship with the
Mexican Ministry of Health, is not offered anywhere else in the Americas</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>The MedSpanish
program has been an “innovation engine” for the community based-training
programs improving care to the “last kilometer of village life” in Mexico and
Latin America, the first line of defense in every potential emergency. </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Training
village inhabitants of this first line of defense empowers communities to work
collectively to address common health issues</p>
<p><b>We Need Your Help!</b></p>
<p>We are raising money to participate
in the <a href=""http://agorapartnerships.org/accelerator-2/accelerator-recruitment"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Agora Partnerships

Not all doctors in Mexico undergo
medical residency programs after completing medical school. As a result, in
many rural areas, doctors are not always trained to properly handle some
situations. Patients in need are sometimes very far from a doctor with proper
training and do not have the time nor money to reach these doctors. Closing
these gaps in medical education would help save more lives, especially in
emergencies and during childbirth.
In the US and Canada, shifting
demographics reveal that communicating in Spanish has become a necessity in
many professional spheres. Nowhere is this more important than in the
healthcare industry. Communicating effectively when discussing issues of health
is a skill that is not just recommended, it must be emphasized continuously so
that Spanish-speaking patients are not marginalized.
PACE MD

PACE MD was the first social impact
organization in Mexico to address particular gaps in Mexican health care skills
and services. It is staffed 100% by Mexican citizens, and has a network of
hundreds of certified medical instructors. In Mexico, the PACEMD program
seeks to improve medical care in areas where mortality rates are high.
PACE MD has pioneered different courses in
Latin America to provide doctors improved knowledge, skills, and abilities.
These include:
-  Basic and Advanced Life Support for Obstetrics courses- decreasing the maternal mortality rate in southern Mexico. -  Basic and Advanced Cardiovascular and Pediatric Life Support courses-  National Association of EMT courses-  PACE SONO Emergency Ultrasound Courses-  Technical Conference on  Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner programs-  International Federation of Emergency Medicine Conferences in Latin AmericaBuilding from the success of these
programs, PACE MD is also developing a training academy and fostering
partnerships that will give this post-doctorate model of education a greater
reach throughout Mexico and Latin America. These programs seek to include,
rather than exclude, as many interested parties as possible in the context of
improved education for health professionals. Other programs being developed by
PACE MD include Spanish language access to the MedChallenger online database,
and the University of New Mexico ECHO Program.
PACE MedSpanish Program
The PACE MedSpanish Program is a
language and cultural immersion program specifically designed for pre-med and
medical students, nurses, paramedics, residents, physicians, emergency and
general medical personnel, and any other medical professionals interacting with
Spanish speaking patients.  Over
the course of 1-4 weeks, students obtain cultural knowledge and skills which
refine their abilities when communicating with Spanish speaking patients at
home. It was founded in the state of Guanajuato (GTO), Mexico and operates in
Guanajuato City (GTO), San Miguel de Allende (GTO), Oaxaca City, Oaxaca (OX),
and San Cristobal de Las Casas, Chiapas (CH). 
The exposure PACE MedSpanish provides
students to clinics, hospitals, rural brigades, and ambulatory services almost
universally sparks a greater interest in global health. The potential that
these networks reach with increased exposure and commitment to impact-driven initiatives
is very powerful. These Global health providers often help PACE develop new
training models to apply in developing conditions. 
PACE MedSpanish is unique because no
other Medical Spanish program in America or Latin America offers multi-week immersion
rotations in medical settings. By granting access to hospitals,
clinics, and the Red Cross, this service speeds up and enhances the
practitioner’s learning experience. This learning model is scalable and
currently available at the four different destination points mentioned above,
each with their own vibrant indigenous populations. 





Impact
PACEMD
· 
PACEMD was the
first social impact organization in Latin America to address “chain of survival” gaps in the Mexican health care system with competency based
training for providers and systems
· 
By January 2014
PACE MD will have trained 15,000+ health care providers through its certification courses
· 
The ALSO course
alone has trained 8,000 doctors 
· 
Overall
enrollment in ALSO has increased by 66% from 2011-13
· 
We are
initiating an “Obstetrical First Responder “ course for traditional midwives in
Chiapas in 2014
PACE MedSpanish
· 
Impacted 400+
visiting students in the states of Guanajuato, Oaxaca, and Chiapas 
· 
This model of
immersion, gained by nurturing a bilateral training relationship with the
Mexican Ministry of Health, is not offered anywhere else in the Americas
· 
The MedSpanish
program has been an “innovation engine” for the community based-training
programs improving care to the “last kilometer of village life” in Mexico and
Latin America, the first line of defense in every potential emergency. 
· 
Training
village inhabitants of this first line of defense empowers communities to work
collectively to address common health issues

is expected to increase an additional 14%. 
Pace MedSpanish
· 
Between
2010-13, travel warnings, perceptions of pervasive crime, and swine flu
concerns kept students away from the program. 
· 
However, the
combination of an improved economy, positive perceptions towards travel within
Mexico, and a retooled marketing strategy has helped us retool our program as
one that will impact a greater number of students in the following year(s).

<p style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px; color: #4D4D4D;"">Research in the sphere of gravitation will provide a clear idea on what the nature of gravitation is, and how we can control and use it. A similar type of a technology can give us the opportunity to construct devices and vehicles which work with electricity, and do not use liquid fuels. This technology will not emit harmful gases into the atmosphere and will, as a result, be ecological.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px; color: #4D4D4D;"">The focus of the research program is:</p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px; color: #4D4D4D;""></p><ul>
<li>to do experimental research;</li>
<li>to construct a gravitational engine.</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px; color: #4D4D4D;"">The scope of this research program is named Gravlet, and because it represents the starting stage we just call it <i>Gravlet Beta</i>.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px; color: #4D4D4D;"">The Gravlet project aims to spread more light onto this type of research, and to make it well known. Crowdfunded by enthusiasts and people all around the world will aid in getting this project off the ground. This is a pioneering project that will accelerate the adoption of new technologies and drive them into the mainstream market.</p>

<p style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px; color: #4D4D4D;""><a href=""http://www.gravlet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Generalization-Classical-Electrodynamics-by-Koen-Vlaenderen.pdf?454fa3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""The Generalization of Classical Electrodynamics"" (in english, size: 114 KB)</a> written by Koen van J. Vlaenderen, and ""The Generalization of Classical Electrodynamics"" by Alexander Tomilin offer a new model according to which the classical electrodynamics (this section of physics based on the Maxwell's equations) is incomplete and it needs re-examination.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px; color: #4D4D4D;"">They show that apart from the electric and the magnetic field in the Maxwell's equations there is also a third one termed by Koen as the Scalar field.</p><p style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px; color: #4D4D4D;""></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/714134/files/20140713071520-scalar-field.png?1405260920"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""font-size: 15px; font-family: Sans-Serif; font-style: italic; color: #999;"">Scalar field definition</p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px; color: #4D4D4D;"">Our supposition is that every atom is a source of this scalar field, the magnitude of which decreases according to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the inverse-square law</a>. In other words, the more we are drifting away from the atom the weaker the scalar field becomes. This effect is very weak for the scales of a single atom, and hardly detectable, but if we have several million of them, or a big enough quantity, this effect will become stronger, and will be correspondingly noticeable and easier to measure. Ask yourself the question: how many atoms does the Earth consist of? The answer is: About 1.33 multiplied by 10 with 50 zeros behind it. And this is how this number looks:</p>
<p style=""font-size: 12px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px; color: #4D4D4D; font-style: italic;"">133,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000<br/></p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px; color: #4D4D4D;"">Also, according to the force law describing how the scalar field interacts with the ""surrounding world"", the behaviour of this interaction is similar to the behaviour of gravity.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px; color: #4D4D4D;"">According to the equation expressing the Scalar field, the generation of such a kind of field is possible under certain conditions, and one of them is to generate high voltages with high frequencies. Imagine 1 million volts <i>(1,000,000 volts)</i> vibrating with the frequency of 1 gigahertz <i>(1,000,000 Hz)</i>...which is a lot!</p><p style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px; color: #4D4D4D;"">And to express how difficult it is to generate and work with 1 million volts, we have to note that the standard Mains electricity powering our homes varies from 110 to 240 volts (depending on the country), which is approximately 4000 times less compared to 1 million volts. Also, the frequency of the Mains electricity system is about 50 - 60 Hz, which is 20,000 times less compared to 1 gigahertz.<br/></p><p style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px; color: #4D4D4D;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/714205/files/20140713080859-electricity-comparision.png?1405264139"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px; color: #4D4D4D;"">Here we have displayed a short comparison between the different systems using electricity with a system which satisfies the conditions to generate observable gravitational effects.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px; color: #4D4D4D;"">From this basic comparison it's obvious that there are not so many electrical systems around the world (if there are any at all) which are able to produce observable gravitational field, and also that the construction of such a type of system requires special research and experimental work.</p>

Our basic idea is to come closer to the nature of gravity, as well as to develop experimental methods which are simulating gravitational effects, thus providing us the ability to construct a gravitational engine.
The engine is based on the idea that gravitation and electricity are closely related which gives us the ability to generate gravitational-waves by using properly constructed electrical devices.

Gravitational engine by Gravlet, white model.


“An enterprising band of physicists and designers is about to launch an IndieGoGo campaign for research and experimentation to develop a product sci-fi fans and futurists have been eagerly awaiting for decades: an antigravity engine.”
– CNN iReporter


“The next big thing in engines might be on its way. If all goes well, it’ll be clean, cheap, efficient, and have the coolest, most futuristic name of any engine yet. It’s called Gravlet, and it’s an anti-gravity propulsion engine.”
– ChipChick


       


Research in the sphere of gravitation will provide a clear idea on what the nature of gravitation is, and how we can control and use it. A similar type of a technology can give us the opportunity to construct devices and vehicles which work with electricity, and do not use liquid fuels. This technology will not emit harmful gases into the atmosphere and will, as a result, be ecological.
The focus of the research program is:

to do experimental research;
to construct a gravitational engine.

The scope of this research program is named Gravlet, and because it represents the starting stage we just call it Gravlet Beta.
The Gravlet project aims to spread more light onto this type of research, and to make it well known. Crowdfunded by enthusiasts and people all around the world will aid in getting this project off the ground. This is a pioneering project that will accelerate the adoption of new technologies and drive them into the mainstream market.





Engine models by Gravlet.







Gravitational wavesAn engine based on antigravity technology will use electrical energy in order to polarize the vacuum which surrounds it, and it will generate gravitational waves to be used as a driving force.




It consumes electrical energyFor the generation of the driving force the antigravity engine will use electrical energy.




EcologicalThe antigravity engine will not emit harmful gases into the atmosphere.




ApplicableThe antigravity technology can have a wide application for the construction of new machines and vehicles.

This is a summary comparison between Gravlet’s engine and other kinds of current technologies.

A short comparison of antigravity technology with other types of technologies.

The basic idea behind the technology is that the gravitational interaction originates from the Maxwell's equations which, on the other side, describe the electro-magnetic interaction as well as a huge number of physical effects.
""The Generalization of Classical Electrodynamics"" (in english, size: 114 KB) written by Koen van J. Vlaenderen, and ""The Generalization of Classical Electrodynamics"" by Alexander Tomilin offer a new model according to which the classical electrodynamics (this section of physics based on the Maxwell's equations) is incomplete and it needs re-examination.
They show that apart from the electric and the magnetic field in the Maxwell's equations there is also a third one termed by Koen as the Scalar field.

Scalar field definition
Our supposition is that every atom is a source of this scalar field, the magnitude of which decreases according to the inverse-square law. In other words, the more we are drifting away from the atom the weaker the scalar field becomes. This effect is very weak for the scales of a single atom, and hardly detectable, but if we have several million of them, or a big enough quantity, this effect will become stronger, and will be correspondingly noticeable and easier to measure. Ask yourself the question: how many atoms does the Earth consist of? The answer is: About 1.33 multiplied by 10 with 50 zeros behind it. And this is how this number looks:
133,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000
Also, according to the force law describing how the scalar field interacts with the ""surrounding world"", the behaviour of this interaction is similar to the behaviour of gravity.
According to the equation expressing the Scalar field, the generation of such a kind of field is possible under certain conditions, and one of them is to generate high voltages with high frequencies. Imagine 1 million volts (1,000,000 volts) vibrating with the frequency of 1 gigahertz (1,000,000 Hz)...which is a lot!And to express how difficult it is to generate and work with 1 million volts, we have to note that the standard Mains electricity powering our homes varies from 110 to 240 volts (depending on the country), which is approximately 4000 times less compared to 1 million volts. Also, the frequency of the Mains electricity system is about 50 - 60 Hz, which is 20,000 times less compared to 1 gigahertz.
Here we have displayed a short comparison between the different systems using electricity with a system which satisfies the conditions to generate observable gravitational effects.
From this basic comparison it's obvious that there are not so many electrical systems around the world (if there are any at all) which are able to produce observable gravitational field, and also that the construction of such a type of system requires special research and experimental work.

Cycle of Gravlet engine operation.

We've been through a long creative process, from the theoretical research, writing the theoretical model, to sketching and engineering of the setups required for our experimental work.
All we need now is you!

We’ve a detailed financing plan for all expenses in the project. For better understanding we've visualized this in a graphic.

The graphic also contains a schedule which displays the processes distributed in chronological order in time.
Quite a reasonable question is why the campaign uses Flexible Funding. The reason is that even if we don't reach the crowdfunding target, in that case we will use the raised money to fund the theoretical work of the project.

We are prepared with a tight budget plan (see above). Take into account that there are no percentages and schedule because they depend on the raised money.

The team of Gravlet is a group of engineers and physicians who have been united around the idea to implement theoretical and experimental activities in the field of gravity.

Gravlet was born at the end of 2013 with a theoretical concept about gravitation as a physical phenomenon. Today we’re working on the theory and the future experiments which are behind the scene. We need your support to bring this idea to life. Here is what we have planed to do in the upcoming months:


We are undertaking something that requires special research and experimental work, especially if we consider that high voltages and high frequencies are required. This is a quite big challenge and we’re dedicated to bringing it a step closer to reality.
It is going to be a journey. We’ve set such a high crowdfunding target for a good reason. From the computer simulations, the real physical tests, to the construction of a stable prototype, the costs are huge.
If you’ve backed us, you’ll be kept right up to date.

Technical questions
Other questions
General questions
What is the present mission of the Team?
Currently
our team is focused on the implementation of experimental activity in
the field of gravity, as well as the development of an
anti-gravitational device. 
The experimental work requires huge efforts which mean that our focus and actions will be totally focused in this direction.
The inspiration of the team?
The
knowledge for the gravitational and anti-gravitational technology
will open a new chapter in the way in which society advances. Human-kind can invent new types of communication systems based on gravity. We can live in a more ecological way without polluting the
environment. Imagine how deep into space we could go with such a type
of anti-gravitation technology. We will face a new world. The
inspiration is obvious; we will study and discover the universe with
one more step!
And of course this is not something which will happen tomorrow (let us be realists), but imagine how one day this will be reality.
What are the challenges?
Hard work.
I'd like to be informed about the development process of Gravlet?
Information about the progress of the project will be published on the web site (www.gravlet.com), but much more detailed information will be presented only to the supporters of Gravlet. For more information look at our perks.
Stay tuned through the social networks listed below.
If I have further questions where can I contact Gravlet?
You can reach us at info@gravlet.com.
Technical questions
What is the anti-gravity technology about?
In order to be able to read more about the idea behind the Gravlet work you should go to the following page: Technology.
More details are to be published later.
There are many pictures on the website depicting a certain device. What is this?
The device which is shown on most of the pictures is a model of an antigravity engine. The energy source is not represented on them.
What are the advantages of the antigravity technology?
The advantages of the antigravity technology are:

ecological, because it will not emit harmful gases in the atmosphere
requires electrical energy
applicable for different devices and vehicles
What are the disadvantages of this technology? Are they easy to overcome?
A disadvantage of the antigravity technology is that a device based on it would emit electromagnetic radiation around itself. This can be overcome through the usage of protection around the engine which has been constructed especially for this goal. 
This is not a real problem. You would not place a metal spoon in a microwave oven or your own hand in an electrical oven, neither should you violate the protection of a similar engine. This is all about technical safety.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p></p>
<em>Preemies * Anastasia’s Gift</em> is a 40-page inspirational and 
informative guide for parents of preemie babies, accompanied by music that can be played for the baby. It began as one mother’s gift to

Anastasia. Patti Bose’s dream was to introduce parents to this new, 
unfamiliar world through her own personal experience, soothing words, 
music, and soft photographs. It is what she wished she had had when she 
was going through the experience. Endorsed by some of the most respected
 individuals in the field, this book is a comforting resource for anyone
 going through this challenging time as a parent.<br/><br/><p></p>

<h1>Timeriffic Backstory </h1>
<p>A mobile developer excited for the new Android platform, decided to program a “no interface” app just for himself. He put the free app on the then called <a href=""http://bit.ly/x84604"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Google Market</a> where there weren’t many apps at launch. Thousands of miles away a mobile designer who at the time was able to watch each app released in real time because there weren’t that many, found this little app. It was a device timer. It could control the device in a few different ways. The mobile designer emailed the mobile developer with some enthusiastic feedback that could make the app better. The developer thought, “Sure it could, but how?” So he challenged the designer. </p>
<p>What he got back was the outline for <a href=""http://bit.ly/gSjC42"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Timeriffic</a> an app that was a mobile timer to save battery life and mute the phone when needed and the developer was inspired. Starting casually the two worked together improving the interface and features along with improving stability. It started to pay off, the star rating began to rise along with the usage. </p>
<p>In 2010 Google named rdrr.labs a Top Android Developer based on download numbers and a 4+ star rating. It was about this time Timeriffic began to get help from around the world translating the app which is available in English, French, Spanish, Chinese, Czech, Danish, German, Hungarian, Italian, Hebrew, Korean and Norwegian with more to come. </p>
<p><img alt=""Google I/O 2011 - Timeriffic"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://rdrrlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/GoogleIO-2011-Timeriffic2.gif"" src="""" style="""" title=""Google I/O 2011 - Timeriffic""/></p>
<p>In 2011 we were asked if our app could be used at Google’s Developer Conference known as Google I/O. It was flattering and certainly a highlight of the year. We also launched <a href=""http://rdrrlabs.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">rdrrlabs.com</a>, began our <a href=""http://rdrrlabs.com/about/assistants/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lab Assistants</a> program, twitter account <a href=""http://bit.ly/TwitRDRR"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">@rdrrlabs</a> and <a href=""http://bit.ly/GplusRDRR"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Google+</a> . </p>
<p>In 2012 we continued our international appeal with a review by two of the mobile heavyweights in <a href=""http://bit.ly/JexcJL"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">LG Mobile Chile</a> and <a href=""http://bit.ly/PmBRN6"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Samsung Italia</a> along with <a href=""http://rdrrlabs.com/about/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">reviews from around the world</a> both video and on the web. We also joined <a href=""http://on.fb.me/rdrrlabs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Facebook.</a> </p>
<p>Since our lab opened we have maintained a policy to answer EVERY single email, helpdesk, feature request, compliment and donation with a personal reply. It is the core of who we are and users love it. </p>

Timeriffic Backstory 
A mobile developer excited for the new Android platform, decided to program a “no interface” app just for himself. He put the free app on the then called Google Market where there weren’t many apps at launch. Thousands of miles away a mobile designer who at the time was able to watch each app released in real time because there weren’t that many, found this little app. It was a device timer. It could control the device in a few different ways. The mobile designer emailed the mobile developer with some enthusiastic feedback that could make the app better. The developer thought, “Sure it could, but how?” So he challenged the designer. 
What he got back was the outline for Timeriffic an app that was a mobile timer to save battery life and mute the phone when needed and the developer was inspired. Starting casually the two worked together improving the interface and features along with improving stability. It started to pay off, the star rating began to rise along with the usage. 
In 2010 Google named rdrr.labs a Top Android Developer based on download numbers and a 4+ star rating. It was about this time Timeriffic began to get help from around the world translating the app which is available in English, French, Spanish, Chinese, Czech, Danish, German, Hungarian, Italian, Hebrew, Korean and Norwegian with more to come. 

In 2011 we were asked if our app could be used at Google’s Developer Conference known as Google I/O. It was flattering and certainly a highlight of the year. We also launched rdrrlabs.com, began our Lab Assistants program, twitter account @rdrrlabs and Google+ . 
In 2012 we continued our international appeal with a review by two of the mobile heavyweights in LG Mobile Chile and Samsung Italia along with reviews from around the world both video and on the web. We also joined Facebook. 
Since our lab opened we have maintained a policy to answer EVERY single email, helpdesk, feature request, compliment and donation with a personal reply. It is the core of who we are and users love it. 
We have some great quotes about how users love Timeriffic, in many languages. Timeriffic was even suggested to the pilot of the Mars Rover Curiosity. It has helped many couples get sleep filled nights, saved from beeps and chirps of email and texts. People in general love the set it and forget it nature, because it just works. But the best story of all time is still from a mom who bought an Android phone for her daughter just for our app.

<p><strong>Our Story</strong></p>
<p> Go Infinite is a mindset and a way of life. Our Tribe has been fighting to make high quality health and fitness resources accessible to everyone since 2015. The journey began 5 years ago, when we hosted our first Free Community Workshop outside in the park. This soon became a popular weekly meetup of people looking to get fit, meet like-minded new friends, and have fun doing something good for their health.</p>
<p>After building a strong community, we then expanded our mission by empowering the kids of Chicago with our Playground Ninjas after school program.</p>
<p>Despite the challenging times, we are committed to helping people to take control of their health and empowering them to achieve their biggest dreams.</p>
<p><strong>Our biggest challenge yet.</strong></p>
<p>Go Infinite Academy has been labeled a non-essential business and has been forced to close its doors, leaving our many clients including children as young as six without a place to exercise, connect with friends and find peace of mind. </p>
<p>This same situation is playing out across the world as people have been removed from the places that typically keep them healthy and sane. </p>
<p><strong>Out of chaos comes the opportunity to create change.</strong></p>
<p>In this new reality, we must find innovative solutions to stay healthy, active and strong. Rather wait it out, our team has put our collective hearts, minds, and talents together to deliver a new and incredibly impactful resource for the well-being of you all, our family, friends and community.  </p>
<p>Although we need your support we want to continue to give back to our community. </p>
<p>We’ve partnered with INDIEGOGO to launch our revolutionary new platform for community health, fitness and culture, Go Infinite Worldwide. Featuring high quality wellness content delivered daily through a mobile app and other video platforms, we will be able to connect with more people than ever before and truly make a bigger impact on the health of our community, our city and our world.</p>
<p>This is how we will fight back against the current global health crisis and related challenges facing us all. We are strong alone but  we are stronger together.</p>
<p>To achieve this dream we need your support dear global family and friends, and have different levels that will go directly towards mobile app development and to support our coaches, staff and facility costs during this mandated shut down.</p>
<p>For your contributions, you will receive some awesome perks like early access to the mobile app which features high quality fitness tutorials, virtual classes, community challenges and additional content to help users stay healthy, active and strong in both mind and body. Users will also be able to directly connect with our wellness coaches for one-on-one consultations and virtual training sessions so they can take control of their health from the comfort of their own home.</p>
<p>We have already launched the kids Virtual Academy which we are hearing is a life saver for parents needing activities to keep their kids healthy and active during the quarantine. </p>

</p><p>The Shift just got Real!!</p>
<p>I know this because I have been on
this journey myself and I feel all of it. Shifting requires adapting,
acclimating, releasing and maneuvering. One thing I have found is that there is
not one answer--there are many. I have been collecting tools as I have
attempted to find the answers that are within me, the planet and the Universe.
The Ancients knew all about this thing we call evolution...and I wanted to as
well, elementally!</p>
<p>My life started with vision and that
was considered to be a gift. In living this, I had so many questions as to whether
it was a really a gift or some sort of curse. It seemed like there was so much
sadness and anger around me and eventually inside of me. I had tried it all,
constantly searching to heal myself and change the patterns that had been
handed down from generation to generation. Each seemed to be a piece but did
not take me where I knew I could be, so I searched further--making it my
personal intention to be waking up happy and going to bed the same way. </p>
<p>Along the way I received insight
into many different modalities, using the Elements that have been around since
our planet's beginning. Learning to use
oils, herbs, natural foods to heal the body while remapping the mind and
connecting to the spirit was very vital in my growth and ability to heal myself.
I see this as The trilogy.. Mind .. Body.. and Soul. </p>
<p>Cellular Somatic Healing, Life
Coaching and Health Nutrition are all aspects of the services I provide. I practice
with a deep understanding of Quantum Language and how it relates to the
physical body as well as the mind and spirit. I have a background in Behavioral Science and
Criminal Justice with an emphasis on International Law. I am also a certified
Cellular Somatic life coach. </p>
<p>If you are on the path to finding
your innermost BEST SELF, please feel free to contact me on at the number
listed below so we can sculpt a healing and release regimen tailored to
whichever life issues you wish to resolve.<span> 
I would be honored to hear from you. Fees discussed upon initial free 30
minute consultation and introductory session. </span></p>
<p>Thank you for allowing me to walk
this journey alongside you!<span>  </span></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><a href=""http://hocr.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""The Head of The Charles Regatta"">The Head of the Charles Regatta</a> is a two day rowing competition held on the Charles River in Boston, USA. The Regatta was first held in 1965 and today attracts over 9,000 athletes and 300,000 spectators.  Rowers from around the world compete in over 1,900 boats in 61 events.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The regatta course is just over 5 kilometres long containing 6 bridges with sharp turns creating a challenging course for crews to negotiate without collisions.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""> </p>
<h2 dir=""ltr""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Why Now:</strong></span></h2>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>No </span><span>Australian LTA crews have competed internationally in recent years <strong>and no Australian LTA crew has ever competed at the Head of the Charles.</strong></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The enthusiasm and dedication shown by the LTA rowers that have been competing in the numerous Club and State regattas in Sydney inspired Barbara Ramjan to launch the project.  This project gives LTA rowers the opportunity to compete at an international regatta, taking their rowing to the next level.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Rowing has given many of these para-rowers a new purpose or direction in their lives. They have overcome their disabilities and inspired others by their courage and determination.  </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The team heading to the Head of the Charles Regatta includes experienced international rowers Peter Siri and Carol Cooke eager to represent Australia again and to conquer yet another challenge, and new comers to the international field of rowing Kathleen Murdoch, Steve Knott, Nikolai Olding, Sara Waitzer together with their coxswain Nell Duly, all looking for a challenge beyond the local Club and State regattas. It is hoped that this international regatta will meet those challenges. </span></p>

What is Head of the Charles Regatta:

The Head of the Charles Regatta is a two day rowing competition held on the Charles River in Boston, USA. The Regatta was first held in 1965 and today attracts over 9,000 athletes and 300,000 spectators.  Rowers from around the world compete in over 1,900 boats in 61 events.
The regatta course is just over 5 kilometres long containing 6 bridges with sharp turns creating a challenging course for crews to negotiate without collisions.
 
Why Now:
No Australian LTA crews have competed internationally in recent years and no Australian LTA crew has ever competed at the Head of the Charles.
The enthusiasm and dedication shown by the LTA rowers that have been competing in the numerous Club and State regattas in Sydney inspired Barbara Ramjan to launch the project.  This project gives LTA rowers the opportunity to compete at an international regatta, taking their rowing to the next level.
Rowing has given many of these para-rowers a new purpose or direction in their lives. They have overcome their disabilities and inspired others by their courage and determination.  
The team heading to the Head of the Charles Regatta includes experienced international rowers Peter Siri and Carol Cooke eager to represent Australia again and to conquer yet another challenge, and new comers to the international field of rowing Kathleen Murdoch, Steve Knott, Nikolai Olding, Sara Waitzer together with their coxswain Nell Duly, all looking for a challenge beyond the local Club and State regattas. It is hoped that this international regatta will meet those challenges. 
Since initiating the project, several para- rowers from across Australia have voiced their desire to be included.

This beautiful 3 year old has a rare genetic disease called Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) and Hypertonia.  There is currently no treatment or cure for MLD. Children displaying symptoms receive treatment limited to pain and symptom management. <br/><br/>In the late infantile form, which is the most common form of MLD (50-60%), affected children begin having difficulty walking after the first year of life, usually at 15–24 months. Symptoms include muscle wasting and weakness, muscle rigidity, developmental delays, progressive loss of vision leading to blindness, convulsions, impaired swallowing, paralysis, and dementia. Children may become comatose.  Most children with this form of MLD die by age 5, often much sooner.<br/><br/>Summer developed symptoms in January 2014.  She couldn't walk and her muscles became rigid. She could no longer hold her bottle or talk. Her abilities began to decline rapidly after that.  In January 2015, after 7 seizures and a high fever she was admitted to Toronto Sick Children's Hospital where she spent 3 weeks undergoing testing and observation. At first, she was diagnosed with Hypertonia, but after more seizures and testing, it was discovered that she also had MLD.  On April 4, the Board of Metabolics Team informed Humberto and Sara that Summer's life expectancy is between 3-5 years.  Needless to say they were, and are devastated.<br/><br/>Summer cannot eat.  Her sole source of nutrition is by a feeding tube inserted into her nose and throat. On August 12, she returns to Toronto Sick Children's hospital where the feeding tube will be removed and inserted into her stomach.<br/><br/>This dear child requires full time care. Humberto lost his job of 4 years because he had to take so much time off to care for Summer.  His employer was not sympathetic and said he couldn't afford to have him away from work so much.  Sara and Humberto have no transportation and have to take Summer on the subway to all her appointments.  Not only is this uncomfortable for her but she is being exposed to everyone's germs. <br/><br/>The government pays for most of Summer's medication, but not for transportation costs or for other things she needs to improve her quality of life.  Humberto and Sara struggle daily to provide for Summer needs, as well as the needs of their other 2 children.  Most of their government assisted money goes towards rent.  This is an extra worry that they are burdened with, when they need all of their mental strength to care for Summer.<br/><br/>As a relative of theirs, I am writing to ask for financial help.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>GymSpark is a fitness technology startup which integrates sensors onto existing gym equipment to provide fitness enthusiasts with essential feedback and statistics. By installing Hall Effect sensors, accelerometers, and Force Sensitive Resistors (FSR), we are able to automatically track weight amounts, rep counts, and workout types, and relay this data directly to the phones of users. This data is then used to provide specifically tailored workout recommendations. Our product distinguishes itself from others on the market because it is automated and removes the complexity of manually entering each exercise, set, and rep. We need your help to put our technology into gyms!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We are seeking $5000 in funding to drive us through prototyping and enable us to purchase the hardware necessary to outfit a local gym with our technology. We estimate it to cost $1,250 to install our sensors into a small gym, so this funding will enable us to complete our prototyping stage and allow us to implement our idea and collect valuable feedback. We want to prove our concept on a small scale before looking to grow.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our manufacturing costs and installation fees are relatively low, so any donation will take us a long way. We are competing in the Duke Startup Challenge, so we have acquired a strong set of mentors who can help us throughout our development. We are very passionate about this product and excited to implement it!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We are always looking for more connections within the fitness industry to discuss ideas and possibilities, so if you or someone you know work in this field, we would love to talk to you about our venture.</p>

</div></div>","Sleep all your problems away.If you, or someone you know, is one of 45% of the world’s population estimated to have a sleep disorder, SleepASAP can help.The type of sleep struggler you are will influence how you deal with your sleep issues. The SleepASAP App helps sleep strugglers identify which night owl they are, to give them personalized sleep solutions to their sleep needs.In addition to the immense disruption to your life, if left untreated, sleeping issues can directly lead to chronic diseases later in life. Let's change that.How does SleepASAP work?Analyze. Identify. Tailor.Hippocrates says “It's more important to know what sort of person has a disease than to know what sort of disease a person has.”We like Hippocrates, but we didn’t want to just take his word for it, but back it up with real hard facts. Through the SleepASAP App, sleep strugglers will have access to the first algorithm that analyzes their symptoms & personality. It identifies their sleep profile, tailors an individualized treatment plan, and provides the nearest place to receive treatment. SleepASAP is Big Data driven, so the more people that use the platform, the more accurate the results will be - and we’ve already created the most accurate platform of this type on the planet!Order our Feel the Change! packages NOW and receive your tailored SleepDNA at a HUGE Discount.
The Process
The SleepASAP app provides a community based, crowdsourced platform to find personalized solutions for sleep strugglers worldwide.
Through our innovative app, you receive a preliminary diagnosis of your Sleep Profile - a combination of your personality + sleep symptoms. Based on your Sleep Profile, our system generates a menu of methods that have helped people like you in the past.
We connect you with the best solution and experts in that solution, tailored just for YOU.
Identification and personality “deep learning” is achieved by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) based on Linguistic Enquiry and Word Count (LIWC) and Big Five personality traits.






Our algorithm and process is a MASSIVE innovation, so here we want to share with you more of how it works.

Up until recently, little was known about the links between personality and sleep patterns which lead to sleep deprivation.
Through various studies, the links were huge and developed a learning algorithm based on a very new concept in computer science, called deep learning. This simulates the way human beings study a topic and become expert at it. So, using this foundation, we combined formal scientific knowledge with the experiential knowledge of people who suffer from sleep difficulties.
The best part is that SleepASAP is getting smarter all the time. You can come back to SleepASAP as often as you wish and keep getting better and better focused solutions for your needs.





The data collected by SleepASAP, provides deep learning that will produce conclusions and lay the foundation for the development of services and products related to sleep.



It’s time to make the world immune to this epidemic!



We need your help to further develop our App and algorithm so that, when we launch our product on the world, anyone who uses our App can sleep easy that they have the best resource at their fingertips to make their problem the stuff of dreams.Visionary techies, empathetic righteous folk and sleep sufferers of the world - UNITE and help us change our world for the better.






With $10,000 we will complete the development of SleepASAP’s App for iOS and Android.

·  Included costs are; app development, servers, and app maintenance
·  App maintenance includes regular feature additions and enhancements based on user community feedback, etc.·  Funds above $10,000 will go towards promotion of the SleepASAP App, making it accessible to many more users worldwide.Our team contains the perfect combination of International Specialists in Sleep Deprivation and Therapies, Experts in Business Development, Computer Scientists and Data Scientists. The problem facing our society is so HUGE, we only use power-houses to develop the solutions.

<p>ON THE COURT</p>
<p>After creating a profile and recording a game, players can begin viewing their game statistics, including time spent on court, match history, match statistics, head-to-head comparisons to other players, and overall ranking. The more games a player records with different opponents, the more accurate his or her ranking will be. </p>

<p>The app lets players share their passion for the game with a larger community.

and calculated into each player's ranking. </p>

</div></div>","Hey all, if you're new to Pulse Play, you can see that we've reached our goal on Indiegogo and we're ecstatic! Not only that, we've launched & Pulse Play can be ordered here or at www.pulse-play.com. To all of our backers, thank you, thank you, thank you. We couldn't have done it without you.




Please note that while we're still responding to comments on our Indiegogo page, we're no longer actively writing any updates - for that, sign up for our newsletter. We're happy to have you with us. 







Pulse Play is a smart watch for tennis players. Founded by three-time Grand Slam doubles champion Andy Ram, Pulse Play was developed to give amateur and recreational players everything the professional players get. 
A professional tennis player for over 16 years, Andy has 19 career titles and numerous Olympic and Davis Cup appearances behind him. He never had to keep score, calculate his match statistics, figure out his ranking, or find opponents at his level. Now he's created a smart watch so you don't have to either.
Pulse Play is about giving amateur and recreational players the professional playing experience. Andy knows what it feels like to be a pro; now you can too.




Here's Andy and his partner Vera Zvonareva after winning the mixed doubles championship at Wimbledon 2006.  
Pulse Play helps you find
players at your level, announces the score live during your match, records your
match history and game statistics, and ranks you among your friends, your club,
your league, your town, and even the world.
With Pulse Play, amateur and recreational players will be able to take their game to the next level and experience it like the pros do.
















Our design team was challenged to create a smart watch that would
be slim, lightweight, comfortable, and have a basic scorekeeping functionality
that could be activated with just one button. The first prototype was
composed of two parts, a silicon band and a ""brain"",
the computing unit that along with a Bluetooth transmitter would register
points to our software.






The goal of the second phase of the smart watch design was to
evolve the prototype into a sleeker, more user-friendly model. We identified
exactly where Pulse Play could be improved:


Adding a LED screen,
     so players can see their match score while they play and the time when they're not


Extending battery life,
     so players can play for 15 hours before recharging


Adding range to the Bluetooth
     transmitter

Finding
materials that are both light and strong, so the smart watch will feel comfortable while enduring an intensely physical game
Improving the look and feel of Pulse
     Play so that it will be elegant enough to be worn both on and off the
     court











                         









The Pulse Play app will be the global hub for amateur racket
sports. While developing it, we aimed to create an app that would
be simple and user-friendly while giving players relevant data about their
game, opponents, and ranking. We took inspiration from other sports
applications and social networks in order to create the first fully-integrated social

Her name is Bell and she has Cystic Fibrosis that required her to receive a double lung transplant at the age of 6. I am raising funds to accomplish several goals. I need to continue paying her health insurance premiums and medicine copays, but I also need to find a place for our family to live as well. Your contributions will ensure Bell continues to receive the care she so desperately needs and allow our family to remain here in St. Louis near her transplant team.</p>
<p>We are attempting to raise $10,000.00 in order to pay her $900.00 a month health insurance premiums and move into a more permanent housing situation while I attempt to find employment in this area. Since Bell’s transplant she has been through more than any child should endure. She had one her lungs come loose and have to be reattached as well as having to be on a lung bypass machine while she recovered from the multiple procedures. She went 26 days without taking a breath; the machine did all the work. This has been very hard on her, so as a father I could not sit there and watch her suffer without doing something. I wanted to do something impossible since it felt like that was what we were asking of her just to survive. At 314lbs the most impossible promise I could make was a marathon. Since then I have lost 130lbs and am set to run that marathon on Oct. 21, 2012. Since I made that promise in Dec. of 2011 I have run 1000 miles in preparation of this event. I will keep this promise.</p>
<p>Your contributions will help me keep my baby healthy while I look for gainful employment (if you are an employer in the St. Louis area I am a hard worker). If you cannot contribute but find my cause deserving please pass our story on to others. There are tools on this site that you can use to notify your friends of our goals. Thank you for your time. Progress of my training can be found on facebook at Daddy’s Bellieve Marathon Training. And Bell’s story is chronicled on the facebook page Help Bell Meet Taylor Swift (which because of everyone involved she did).</p></div>","I am William Barnawell an unemployed firefighter and the father of the strongest, most amazing 7 year old I have ever known.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>This is a family effort to help David, a 46 year old father, son, brother, uncle &amp; friend, purchase an accessible van so that he can enjoy his life, despite MS, to the fullest. </p>
<p>David was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis at the very young age of 25 and swiftly went from healthy young man and father of two little boys, to disabled and in a wheelchair.  Before his now 22 year old son was 3 feet tall, he had learned to transfer dad from bed to chair and back again… and today David spends all of his waking hours in a heavy 500 lb motorized wheelchair so that he can be comfortable and mobile for his caregivers.  He cannot operate the chair, but it’s his way around the world these days.  David needs assistance to do everything except smile that big kind smile he shares with everyone.   </p>
<p>Our family has rallied throughout the years to help Dave live a better life, including raising money for a stem cell transplant when it was still an experimental option for MS.  We’ve pulled together to turn a small unaccommodating house into a place he could live with family and be independent of the facility he’d been living in, and most times when David has a need, we find a way to accommodate him.  This time we need help from you….  </p>
<p>Currently David gets around town riding in the back of a big oversized cargo type van, with his chair strapped to the floor.  Going over a small bump in the road about gives him a whiplash!  The van is no longer reliable transportation so Dave can’t travel far from home, and we live in a beautiful place in Southern Oregon, so there’s lots he would like to see.  It has an old style type lift that wasn’t designed for his heavy wheelchair, and the mechanics of it are no longer supported by the local hydraulic specialist, not to mention that it’s frightening to get him in and out of the van…. There is only one person in Dave’s life (a loyal caregiver) who is able to make this mode of transportation work for him.  It’s time to move into this century and help Dave get a different van.</p>
<p>The vans we are looking at aren’t new, but are a huge improvement over his current transportation.  Importantly, it will allow David to sit up front in the passenger space in his own chair.  He hasn’t seen the world from the front seat of a car for years! </p>

<h3>Let's Help Bekr</h3>
My name is George. My wife and I have been together for 7 years. We were childhood friends. She went her way, I went mine... only to meet up again 20 years later. We were meant to be.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>About Bekr</strong></div>
<div><strong> </strong></div>
<div>She is very open about mental health/illness and wishes to help others. She runs a blog about mental health/bipolar disorder and helps so many people on a daily basis and asks for nothing in return. She has always been a kind giving soul, and would do anything for anyone. She is always smiling no matter how terrible she feels. Ready and willing to help others, while she is having a difficult time herself. She is unable to work because of her condition.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This campaign is for my wife, Bekr. She has been hospilalized against her will many times due to suicide attempts and other hospilizations due to her mental health. Her well-being is extremely important to me and our family. The medical expenses have added up and we have tried to get them covered by insurance, but they have been rejected. She has tried countless times to get funds and this ""situation"" under control, only to be turned away time and time again, causing more undue stress on her already fragile state of mind.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Every little donation can add up to help at least put a dent in these medical bills. Which would help my wife very much with her stress and her daily life. Decreasing these bills or completely paying them off would be such a grand gesture for my wife. It would lift a heavy burden that has befallen upon her. Helping her overall wellness and sense of being.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Where will my money go?</strong></div>
<div><strong> </strong></div>
<div>These medical expenses have added up to over $30,000. Anything we get from here will go toward those bills. While, yes, it would be nice to get that amount, we realize that is unrealistic. So we are setting the goal of $5000, which is plenty. Anything we make over that (if we do) then that would be fantastic. Again, any and all of the funds would be put toward these medical bills.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Perks</strong></div>
<div><strong> </strong></div>
<div>My wife loves taking photos and creates little cards with sayings on them. So with donations we will be able offer some tokens of gratitude.</div>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>My wife is hoping to start a Non-Profit Foundation helping those with mental disorders. To help pay for medical expenses already accrued and to help others that need care. A place to turn to when people need it the most. To be the voice for those that can't open or speak up. With this stress out of the way, she will be ready to get this started and hopefully make a real difference in others lives. She has a big heart and wishes to put it to good use.</p>

MEET YICOLY YICOLY is the world's first auto vacuum sealed bottle that keeps your drinks fresher, longer. Its patented one-touch vacuum technology combined with the thermal insulation design ensures your smoothies and juices last all day and tastes just as fresh as the first sip. It's perfect for your daily routine no matter where need to be.A Review From Netherlands Health Coach   Freshly Made DrinksTend to GO BAD QuicklyHomemade juice is a more convenient, affordable and delicious way to boost your fruit and vegetable intake. But keeping homemade juice and smoothie fresh while on-the-go is still a common challenge. When fruits and vegetables are exposed to air, they start to oxidize, turning them brown and depleting them of their nutrients.   YICOLYSeals in FreshnessYICOLY slows down the oxidation process by removing air/oxygen from the bottle. The lid of the bottle is integrated with an electronic vacuum pump that acts as a preserver by removing the air from the bottle and maintaining a tight seal.Vacuum-sealed juice tastes so much better. It holds its moisture and flavor, whether you are making your juice, smoothie or any other drink with you, you will get an all-day freshness. We filmed a timelapse over the course of 3 days. The results speak for themselves.  Effective DecompressionYICOLY's patented deep vacuum removes all of the air and creates a tight seal that is only broken with you open the valve - ensuring your food stays fresher - longer.YICOLY will remove all the air from the body. Unlike the marshmallows, your fruits will not get any bigger – but its preservation period will extend 5x longer.  Keep Your DrinkThe Temperature You WantHate when you make your coffee and its cold by the time you get to work? Lukewarm coffee? Never again! Featuring double-walled (stainless steel/glass) construction and vacuum insulation technology, YICOLY will keep your drink cold for up to 24 hours and hot for up to 12 hours.   PERFECTFor All Drinks Thanks to the vacuum sealing tech and the thermal insulated design, YICOLY is perfect for any kind of drink. It holds its moisture and flavor while keeping your drink the temperature you want, and it tastes just as fresh as the first sip. It's perfect for juice, smoothie, coffee, milkshake, protein shake, tea, and etc.   Intelligent ReadingsAt a GlanceThe water bottle features an integrated OLED display. On this miniature screen, you'll always be able to see whether if the content of your bottle is hot, warm, or cold. The next time you bring along a hot drink to your office or on a hike, you can confidently take a sip.      Easy to Open The water bottle top stops sucking the air out while you are ready to drink. This makes the cap easier to be taken off. No worry that air pressure will push the lid and won’t let you open.    No Handwashing Necessary The detachable rubber strap allows for easy removal and easy cleaning. The body is composed of 316 stainless steel & 100% BPA-Free materials that do not retain odors.And we get it. Once you have used your great bottle, you want to clean it. You can do so by hand, or just pop it in the dishwasher! YICOLY allows you to put it in the dishwasher, the lid can be easily washed by hand.  It's Very Easy to Use YICOLY comes with a very easy-to-use design. The single button on the lid triggers all the functions you need. A single press will switch between display screens (pressure/temperature/battery), and a double press will start or stop the vacuum pump.    Take it Wherever You GoWant to take cold water with you on a hike? Want to keep your juice fresh at the gym? Want to bring your friend some piping hot soup? YICOLY makes it possible.   Reduces Wastes & PollutionsWe believe that healthier living starts with vacuum-sealing our freshly made juice — and creating a better way to manage your daily fruit and vegetable intake. Also, it reduces your spends on bottle-drinks and reduces wastes on food. In other words, it saves time, money and helps maintain the nutrients in your freshly made foods. The use of plastic has become integral to our lives. In the juice world, it has become a quick and easy way to store juice and keep it edible for longer. Although it is convenient and comfortable, it is incredibly harmful to the environment. The perfect height, the perfect capacity. And there are two capacity - 450ml (stainless steel) and 500ml (glass) and three colors (black/white/lucid) for choice. Meet your daily drinking needs, drink as healthy as you can!    Here are our main staffsWe are YICOLY team, who are passionate about juicing, health, fitness, and design. YICOLY was started with a simple vision where innovative technology can be combined with inspirational design to help people access healthy drinking easily and sustainably.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h2><strong>Background</strong></h2>
<p>What happened to my feet?  I was born with a congenital birth defect, called bilateral syndactyly.  You can see a picture at the very top of this page.</p>
<p>I had corrective surgery when I was 4-5 years old to narrow my feet enough to wear shoes.  I was in bed for several weeks, as my feet had to be elevated the entire time to assist in keeping the swelling down from all the bones they broke/cut/gnawed on.  I can distinctly remember the struggle experienced learning to walk a second time, and my mom cutting the toe portion off a pair of my dads socks to slide the ""tube"" over my knees to pad them so I could crawl around when I was regaining mobility. I was young and had been pinned down for too long, with a ton of pent up kid energy.  When I started crawling, I would do so until my knees were bleeding, thus the sock invention.  I remember my dad coming home from work, and looking down at me crawling -- just giving a warm smile, glad to have me home.  But it could have been that I looked just a little odd, as well.  I remember a trip to Disneyland after that surgery, where my father and older brother took turns putting me on their shoulders because I still couldn't walk well enough.</p>
<p>I used to have a good paying job at Microsoft, but had to consider alternate employment as my job function wasn't one that can be readily ""accommodated"" and the torque on my feet was just too much after several years.  So I dumped my savings into books and tuition to go back to school.</p>
<p>My school is pressuring me to go on disability to help offset some recent and planned medical costs, but I simply refuse.  It's part of who I am as an individual not to throw in the towel.  Instead, I chose to take out student loans and continue my independence.  Take that! Administration office.  But a big thank you to Behin in the Financial Aid office for helping to push my loans through the system.</p>
<h2><strong>Living with a Disability</strong></h2>
<p>I am thankful that I can walk, but most activities, like running or other sports are out of the question because they create great torque on my feet that is quite painful which crawls up my legs to about my knees, and lasts for a few days.</p>
<p>Shopping for shoes is a challenge, because my feet are two different sizes and require finding a size 4.5-5 for my right foot and a 5.5-6 for the left.  Since the stores don't allow a mix and match in sizes, I have to buy two pairs each time.  Because my feet are so small, I often end up buying shoes from the kids section.  Finding two sets of shoes that match is often difficult.  Last year, I ended up with shoes that had lights in the heel, what a conversation piece those were.  But strangely enough, with my personality, I can pull off wearing something that bizarre.  I still have the shoes.  The big drawback here though, is cost.  Shoes x2 plus an orthotic insert in each.</p>
<p>I was teased in school (as were a lot of kids), and was often told I had ""Ton Ton"" feet (think Star Wars movies).  They had two toes and so do I.</p>
<p>And as can be expected, I pay more than the average Joe in medical bills.</p>
<h2><strong>Avoiding Trouble</strong></h2>
<p>I learned early on that I needed to keep active.  Keeping muscle tone in my legs and ankles allows me to retain a lot of mobility and reduces episodes of pain.  As a result, I try to walk around the campus where I go to college rather than take the Disability Support Program's offer of shuttle rides from class to class.  I rode the tram once, but I felt awkward -- almost like I should give the guy a gratuity when he dropped me off.</p>
<p>Besides walking, I also see benefit in cycling with equal results in terms of my mobility, there are health benefits to biking, like cardio vascular conditioning.  I've heard many people tell me they can't ride for this reason or that...  all I can say to them -- If I can do it, you can too.</p>
<h2><strong>Making Progress</strong></h2>
<p>I used to ride a 2-wheeled bike.  But as the years progress, it has become difficult to go even 5 miles without being sore for several days.  In order to keep excess pressure off my feet, I would hold a lot of my weight on my hands &amp; arms.  That is, until they couldn't sustain, then my feet take the brunt of the weight plus pressure pedaling.  The usual result is that I'm hurting for 3-4 days.  So I decided to locate a recumbent trike.   Yep, I'm not too proud to tool around on a tricycle.</p>
<p>The seating position puts all my weight on my back and rear, where it should be -- and if my feet start to get sore, I can just stop and rest.  No need to stand around or find a place to sit.  I contacted a local bike shop that had a used recumbent with cambered rear wheels (so I'm less apt to tip over and get hurt), and explained my situation.  Upon visiting the shop, the salesman made some adjustments to the bike and off I went.  I was fortunate that he sold me the bike for roughly half of the cost of a new one.  But it was still a whopping $1000.</p>
<p>But there is one problem.  Recumbent bikes weigh a lot more than a regular bike, and when I first tried it, I had a lot of difficulty riding over a pedestrian overpass.  I had to stop a few times going over, and was rather humiliated when I was passed by joggers.</p>
<p>I called the bike shop back, and he put me in contact with a specialty shop about twenty minutes away.  The plan is to put a motorized hub on the bike, and a lithium-polymer battery.  This will allow me to use motor assist to get up over the pedestrian walkways, and yet allow me to work my leg muscles too.</p>
<h2><strong>Electrification is the Solution</strong></h2>
<p>But one thing I have learned, getting a setup that will allow me to ride the bike in the manner I desire, is very expensive – simply more than I can afford while I'm going to school.  I'm getting some assistance from the provider of the electric setup, but overall I'm going to be set back about $3000.  This will get closer to $4000 if I get a hitch &amp; rack for the recumbent to put on my car and be able to take it to other bike trails.  It's near 84"" long, so putting it in my car won't work.</p>
<p>I can try to make the conversion a little more affordable by using SLA (sealed lead acid) batteries, but they are heavy -- a whopping 36lbs each! So it seems a bit counter to my goal to make the bike even heavier, ultimately reducing the amount of exercise I get on my lower extremities, because I'll need to use the motor assist more to offset the added weight.  The entire lithium-polymer battery pack is a mere 8lbs.  But the cost of this battery is $600-1000 depending on the mileage capacity.  With the added costs of a controller, motor, throttle, wiring and the work involved, it's going to go way beyond making my credit card scream for mercy.</p>
<h2><strong>Community</strong></h2>
<p>So I'm asking for my fellow online community members for some generosity to help get me back outside this summer.  Everyone's life is a story, and my bike will have a story of its own thanks to you.</p>
<p>My request includes (since I already bought the bike for $1000):</p>
<p>Motor<br/> 50 Mile Battery<br/> Controller<br/> Thumb Throttle<br/> Wiring<br/> Labor<br/> Hitch &amp; rack</p>
<p>Ideally, I'd like to be able to put the long range battery on the bike, simply because the cost of the 19 mile battery is $600+ and will likely be deprecated and unused (wasted) once I put the long term pack on the bike.  It's $400 more for the long range.  How the bike is configured will ultimately depend on the success of my campaign.  I've also included the hitch and rack so that I can take the bike to other trails that are only reachable by car. </p>
<p>My old bike is being donated.  I have located a student on campus that is lacking a car, and has to ride the bus for 3 hours a day.  His funds are as tight as mine, and he's essentially stuck within a 1-2 mile radius of his flat, so in consideration of people helping me out here, I'm already planning on helping someone else.  He has offered me $300 for my old bike -- on payments  -- but what he doesn't know yet, is that I'm going to take the bike and just give it to him this weekend.  But I will ask him to do something nice for someone else in return.</p>
<p>As the campaign proceeds, I'll provide updates, pictures and maybe even a video of a test drive while I work with the dealer getting my bike set up.</p>
<p>If you are unable to provide a monetary contribution, would you be so kind as to cross post this to your social media pages?</p>
<h2>Updates</h2>

What happened to my feet?  I was born with a congenital birth defect, called bilateral syndactyly.  You can see a picture at the very top of this page.
I had corrective surgery when I was 4-5 years old to narrow my feet enough to wear shoes.  I was in bed for several weeks, as my feet had to be elevated the entire time to assist in keeping the swelling down from all the bones they broke/cut/gnawed on.  I can distinctly remember the struggle experienced learning to walk a second time, and my mom cutting the toe portion off a pair of my dads socks to slide the ""tube"" over my knees to pad them so I could crawl around when I was regaining mobility. I was young and had been pinned down for too long, with a ton of pent up kid energy.  When I started crawling, I would do so until my knees were bleeding, thus the sock invention.  I remember my dad coming home from work, and looking down at me crawling -- just giving a warm smile, glad to have me home.  But it could have been that I looked just a little odd, as well.  I remember a trip to Disneyland after that surgery, where my father and older brother took turns putting me on their shoulders because I still couldn't walk well enough.
I used to have a good paying job at Microsoft, but had to consider alternate employment as my job function wasn't one that can be readily ""accommodated"" and the torque on my feet was just too much after several years.  So I dumped my savings into books and tuition to go back to school.
My school is pressuring me to go on disability to help offset some recent and planned medical costs, but I simply refuse.  It's part of who I am as an individual not to throw in the towel.  Instead, I chose to take out student loans and continue my independence.  Take that! Administration office.  But a big thank you to Behin in the Financial Aid office for helping to push my loans through the system.
Living with a Disability
I am thankful that I can walk, but most activities, like running or other sports are out of the question because they create great torque on my feet that is quite painful which crawls up my legs to about my knees, and lasts for a few days.
Shopping for shoes is a challenge, because my feet are two different sizes and require finding a size 4.5-5 for my right foot and a 5.5-6 for the left.  Since the stores don't allow a mix and match in sizes, I have to buy two pairs each time.  Because my feet are so small, I often end up buying shoes from the kids section.  Finding two sets of shoes that match is often difficult.  Last year, I ended up with shoes that had lights in the heel, what a conversation piece those were.  But strangely enough, with my personality, I can pull off wearing something that bizarre.  I still have the shoes.  The big drawback here though, is cost.  Shoes x2 plus an orthotic insert in each.
I was teased in school (as were a lot of kids), and was often told I had ""Ton Ton"" feet (think Star Wars movies).  They had two toes and so do I.
And as can be expected, I pay more than the average Joe in medical bills.
Avoiding Trouble
I learned early on that I needed to keep active.  Keeping muscle tone in my legs and ankles allows me to retain a lot of mobility and reduces episodes of pain.  As a result, I try to walk around the campus where I go to college rather than take the Disability Support Program's offer of shuttle rides from class to class.  I rode the tram once, but I felt awkward -- almost like I should give the guy a gratuity when he dropped me off.
Besides walking, I also see benefit in cycling with equal results in terms of my mobility, there are health benefits to biking, like cardio vascular conditioning.  I've heard many people tell me they can't ride for this reason or that...  all I can say to them -- If I can do it, you can too.
Making Progress
I used to ride a 2-wheeled bike.  But as the years progress, it has become difficult to go even 5 miles without being sore for several days.  In order to keep excess pressure off my feet, I would hold a lot of my weight on my hands & arms.  That is, until they couldn't sustain, then my feet take the brunt of the weight plus pressure pedaling.  The usual result is that I'm hurting for 3-4 days.  So I decided to locate a recumbent trike.   Yep, I'm not too proud to tool around on a tricycle.
The seating position puts all my weight on my back and rear, where it should be -- and if my feet start to get sore, I can just stop and rest.  No need to stand around or find a place to sit.  I contacted a local bike shop that had a used recumbent with cambered rear wheels (so I'm less apt to tip over and get hurt), and explained my situation.  Upon visiting the shop, the salesman made some adjustments to the bike and off I went.  I was fortunate that he sold me the bike for roughly half of the cost of a new one.  But it was still a whopping $1000.
But there is one problem.  Recumbent bikes weigh a lot more than a regular bike, and when I first tried it, I had a lot of difficulty riding over a pedestrian overpass.  I had to stop a few times going over, and was rather humiliated when I was passed by joggers.
I called the bike shop back, and he put me in contact with a specialty shop about twenty minutes away.  The plan is to put a motorized hub on the bike, and a lithium-polymer battery.  This will allow me to use motor assist to get up over the pedestrian walkways, and yet allow me to work my leg muscles too.
Electrification is the Solution
But one thing I have learned, getting a setup that will allow me to ride the bike in the manner I desire, is very expensive – simply more than I can afford while I'm going to school.  I'm getting some assistance from the provider of the electric setup, but overall I'm going to be set back about $3000.  This will get closer to $4000 if I get a hitch & rack for the recumbent to put on my car and be able to take it to other bike trails.  It's near 84"" long, so putting it in my car won't work.
I can try to make the conversion a little more affordable by using SLA (sealed lead acid) batteries, but they are heavy -- a whopping 36lbs each! So it seems a bit counter to my goal to make the bike even heavier, ultimately reducing the amount of exercise I get on my lower extremities, because I'll need to use the motor assist more to offset the added weight.  The entire lithium-polymer battery pack is a mere 8lbs.  But the cost of this battery is $600-1000 depending on the mileage capacity.  With the added costs of a controller, motor, throttle, wiring and the work involved, it's going to go way beyond making my credit card scream for mercy.
Community
So I'm asking for my fellow online community members for some generosity to help get me back outside this summer.  Everyone's life is a story, and my bike will have a story of its own thanks to you.
My request includes (since I already bought the bike for $1000):
Motor 50 Mile Battery Controller Thumb Throttle Wiring Labor Hitch & rack
Ideally, I'd like to be able to put the long range battery on the bike, simply because the cost of the 19 mile battery is $600+ and will likely be deprecated and unused (wasted) once I put the long term pack on the bike.  It's $400 more for the long range.  How the bike is configured will ultimately depend on the success of my campaign.  I've also included the hitch and rack so that I can take the bike to other trails that are only reachable by car. 
My old bike is being donated.  I have located a student on campus that is lacking a car, and has to ride the bus for 3 hours a day.  His funds are as tight as mine, and he's essentially stuck within a 1-2 mile radius of his flat, so in consideration of people helping me out here, I'm already planning on helping someone else.  He has offered me $300 for my old bike -- on payments  -- but what he doesn't know yet, is that I'm going to take the bike and just give it to him this weekend.  But I will ask him to do something nice for someone else in return.
As the campaign proceeds, I'll provide updates, pictures and maybe even a video of a test drive while I work with the dealer getting my bike set up.
If you are unable to provide a monetary contribution, would you be so kind as to cross post this to your social media pages?

Now is our chance to finally give back to her...</p>
<p>Kendra &amp; her 2 cats have been virtually homeless for over 6 months. She is very humble and didn't want others to know how difficult her situation has been!</p>
<p>My family and I had given her a place to stay and a warm bed for a few weeks, but unfortunately due to our own struggling situation we are unable to help her on a permanent basis to live here.

I'm doing this campaign and pleading for help because she finally has a chance to move into an affordable apartment... But she needs all of our help ASAP</p>
<p>Just a little backround:<br/>Kendra is sick and struggling to win her battle to beat Lyme Disease &amp; Mold Toxicity and many other auto-immune infections. The last home she lived in made her more sick as there was mold in the house. She had to quickly move out and without any other place to go, she ended up in her car and then temporarily at a motel. Unfortunately things got worse for her as she stayed at a new motel because the room had mold which set off her illness where she was in the hospital for a month, then out and back in again weeks at a time. Each time she had a more and more difficult time recovering for the exposure and quickly ran out of funds.</p>
<p>Kendra finally found two doctors in Illinois that are helping her and take her insurance, however, finding a chemical &amp; mold free place to move into has been extremely difficult.</p>
<p>Well, the GREAT news is that she has found a place to move, but desperately need the help for the deposit, first months rent, and to set up the basic utilities, &amp; to rent a trailer to move the remainder of her things out of storage.</p>
<p>Unfortunately Kendra has NO support from family, not even an offer for a place for her to stay. They've told her to go live in a homeless shelter and that IS NOT acceptable! Kendra is too sick, exhausted, and unable to stay at a shelter. We have looked into them and they are packed and you must wait in lines to even see if you could get a cot to sleep on. You cannot stay there more than a day. This isn't feasible for many reasons - most importantly her immunity. Section 8 waiting list is 3-4 years long and Kendra needs a home now, so she can start to recover and build up some of her strength back.</p>
<p>She has stayed with us a few times and she is like family, and I believe family should always be there, to help, be a shoulder to support on, and love. We love Kendra as do many of you. Even you don't know her, I am begging for a simple donation to help her more than I can myself.</p>
<p>Please consider donating even a $1 I know would make her smile. Also I am asking if you could share this with some friends as well. Every little bit counts!!! It does matter and so does Kendra!</p>

<p>Pricing Healthcare is busting the healthcare pricing market wide open, exposing the closely guarded pricing secrets of insurers and healthcare providers. We let consumers go to a single, easy-to-use website where they can compare procedure-level prices across all the healthcare facilities in their area.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever experienced the shock of an expensive medical bill, or known someone who has, then you understand the problem we’re trying to solve. Consumers have no recourse for outrageously high prices.  They want to know what they’re being billed for, what all of those procedure codes mean, if their bill is correct, and most importantly, if there's a place nearby that charges less.</p>
<p>There are lots of prices out there – list prices, insured rates, cash discounts.  We let people see all of it.  Nothing like this exists today.</p>
<p> </p>

<div>
<h3>The Solution <span style=""font-size: 12px; font-weight: normal;"">(patent pending)</span>
</h3>
<p>A number of companies have tried for years to convince hospitals and insurers to publish pricing data, but it's in the best interest of hospitals and insurers to keep this information secret.  Without this data, our competitors have been left to provide overly generalized estimates and very small fragments of the pricing picture, and have been unable to expose protected pricing data.</p>
<p>The data that could transform the healthcare industry is out there.  It’s sitting in our file cabinets and in the pile of bills on our kitchen counter. Our model is to help patients come together at the grass roots level, and anonymously share the pricing data from their healthcare bills.  That data is then combined and shown for your specific community, anywhere in the country.</p>
<p>Using our site is easy.  A user simply selects the facility listed on their bill, enters their primary insurance, then enters the service date, procedure code, and price charged from the bill details.  The site then displays descriptive information on the code, the lowest price for all payment types (including the average insured rate, the providers's retail and cash discount prices, and the medicare rate for the region), and names of the lowest-priced facilities in the area, with their prices.</p>
<p>Pricing Healthcare is pulling back the curtain on healthcare pricing by letting consumers anonymously share information from their bills online.  It's as simple as it is revolutionary.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Benefits</h3>
<p>Consumers can save hundreds and thousands of dollars, comparing prices and finding the best healthcare at the lowest price.  Not only can patients choose to go to a lower-priced provider for big savings, but our information can also be used in trying to get a provider to lower the amount on your bill after the fact.  Pricing Healthcare also helps consumers find abnormalities and errors in their bills, such as double billing.  We save all the data you submit and provide you with a dashboard that allows you to see and manage your healthcare history.</p>
<p>Imagine what we could all do, collectively, with all the data from our healthcare bills anonymously online and freely available to other consumers.  Healthcare providers, like all American businesses, will have to compete on quality <strong>and price</strong>.</p>
<p>The rise in healthcare prices is one of America's biggest crises.  Nothing is more effective at lowering prices than good old-fashioned competition.  We can work together and make a huge difference, by exposing healthcare prices on a single site that is open to everyone.</p>

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>We have a small, talented team of senior developers and a handful of top marketing and legal resources.  Most of us have had leadership roles on very large, enterprise-level projects at some of the biggest companies in America, and the founding members have worked together for years.</p>
<p>Randy, the founder and CEO, is also our chief architect and senior developer.  In addition to working for Intel, Microsoft, and HP, he has spent years building scalable web healthcare systems, and is passionate about making healthcare more affordable.</p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We are just a couple months away from launching our public Beta (planned for June 2013).  Over the last year the Pricing Healthcare team has poured a lot of our savings and free time into this product.  In order to have a successful launch and reach a critical mass of people, we need additional funding for the following things.</p>
<ul>
<li>A robust hosting environment: There are tens of thousands of codes with prices at hundreds of thousands of facilities in this country.  Our data set at launch time will be very large, and we need servers that can handle it.  Because our environment also has more complex security needs for things like HIPAA compliance, we can't get by with the cheap, smaller-scale hosting plans.</li>
<li>Supplemental data: We have opportunities to supplement portions of the pricing data, but that data has a price.</li>
<li>Outreach campaigns: The speed at which this site transforms the pricing landscape depends on getting information from a lot of people in a relatively short timeframe.  Additional funding will be carefully used to accelerate our outreach campaigns in targeted locations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your donations at any level will go toward these things.  We're asking for your help.</p>
<p>If you feel like you just can't contribute funds, we would love help getting the word out by mentioning our campaign in email and social media (see links to our pages below).  We also encourage you to use IndieGoGo share tools.</p>

<div style=""font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; margin: 20px 0 10px; padding: 5px 0; background-color: #f0f0f0; width: 100%;"">  Frequently asked questions</div>
<div><strong>Can I use the site without submitting data from my bills?<br/></strong></div>
<div style=""height: 4px;""> </div>
<div style=""padding-bottom: 20px;"">Our success depends on individual contributions from within each community. All users are required to enter at least one line item (a medical code and a price) from one of their recent medical bills.</div>
<div><strong>Why do you require medical codes?<br/></strong></div>
<div style=""height: 4px;""> </div>
<div style=""padding-bottom: 20px;"">Medical billing is done at the code level.  Comparing line items with the same text description from two different bills may not be an apples-to-apples comparison.  For example, there is a different code (at a higher price) used for seeing a physician at their office if you are a new patient vs. an established patient.  There are also different codes used depending on how long you talk to your physician.  You should be skeptical of anyone offering to give you a quote on medical services that doesn't mention these codes.</div>
<div><strong>Do you get data from other sources?<br/></strong></div>
<div style=""height: 4px;""> </div>
<div style=""padding-bottom: 20px;"">Yes. We are regularly importing data from public and proprietary sources and expect that flow to increase over time. Medical offices and hospitals may submit their chargemasters directly to us to publish, and we expect more and more will want to do so, especially those at the lower end of the price spectrum.</div>
<div><strong>Can my doctor's office use your site when recommending treatments?<br/></strong></div>
<div style=""height: 4px;""> </div>
<div style=""padding-bottom: 20px;"">Yes, and please ask the facilities you visit to use Pricing Healthcare. We are also creating products specifically for medical organizations with the intent of providing better care for consumers at a lower cost.</div>
<div><strong>Won't lower-priced care generally result in lower-quality care?<br/></strong></div>
<div style=""height: 4px;""> </div>
<div style=""padding-bottom: 20px;"">There have been studies year after year attempting to find a correlation between price and quality of care, but there has never been any evidence found that paying more will result in higher quality care.</div>
<div><strong>How does the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) affect this space?<br/></strong></div>
<div style=""height: 4px;""> </div>
<div style=""padding-bottom: 20px;"">The ACA focuses primarily on providing insurance to Americans who did not have it, and does not slow the rise in healthcare costs.  Prices are increasing for many under this plan.  Government subsidies will be used to control rising costs for the rest, which masks what the real prices are, burdens taxpayers, and becomes a huge incentive for fraud.</div>
<div><strong>Don't most people have good health plans through their employer?</strong></div>
<div style=""height: 4px;""> </div>
<div style=""padding-bottom: 20px;"">The number of Americans with employer-based health insurance has been declining for years, and is now well below 50% of the country.  In addition, employers are rapidly moving to plans that minimize future costs for the employer and place much of the burden on employees, either through high-deductible plans or by businesses getting out of employer health benefits altogether.</div>
<div><strong><strong>Once everyone's insured, don't we all just care about our in-network rates?</strong><br/></strong></div>
<div style=""height: 4px;""> </div>
<div style=""padding-bottom: 20px;"">The CBO estimates after the ACA is fully in place, there will still be some 30 million Americans uninsured.  And as insurance-negotiated rates increase, there are actually a growing number of people finding that going outside the insurance system and paying cash rates saves them a lot of money.</div>
<div><strong><strong>I'm on Medicare - is this site for me?</strong><br/></strong></div>
<div style=""height: 4px;""> </div>
<div style=""padding-bottom: 20px;"">Medical practices lose a lot of money on Medicare and Medicaid patients. Large numbers of providers are getting out of this business. If trends continue, it will become increasingly difficult, even in the next 5 years, to find practices that will take on new Medicare or Medicaid patients, leaving those consumers, many with lower-than-average incomes, to pay high list prices directly (or find very expensive insurance). Pricing Healthcare will help these consumers find quality care they can afford.</div>
<div style=""font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; margin: 20px 0 10px; padding: 5px 0; background-color: #f0f0f0; width: 100%;"">  Additional FAQs</div>
<div><strong>How does this site help me save money?<br/></strong></div>
<div style=""height: 4px;""> </div>
<div style=""padding-bottom: 20px;"">Many patients are becoming aware of the huge price differences there can be between facilities in the same area for the same service.  The media is also beginning to cover the fact that paying the cash price can sometimes be a lot less than going through your insurance.  Getting this information over the phone is almost impossible, and there are no other web sites you can visit to get this information.  We show you apples-to-apples comparisons of all the prices at facilities that are close to you.  With that data at your fingertips you can find care at a lower cost.  And even for services you have already received, we give you information on codes and descriptions and competitive pricing to make you a more formidable negotiator if you wish to call and get your payments reduced.</div>
<div><strong>Is your first loyalty to consumers? What are your revenue sources?<br/></strong></div>
<div style=""height: 4px;""> </div>
<div style=""padding-bottom: 20px;"">
<p style=""margin-top: 0;"">Our site is open to everyone, and independent of any provider, insurance carrier, or government entity.  At this time we are not planning to collect ad revenue.  Our revenue model includes a small annual subscription fee after Beta (currently targeting about $15 per year for consumers) to cover license fees and other costs so we don't have to have ads on our site.  This keeps our loyalties focused on patients.  Later revenue streams may include hospitals, insurance brokers, and government agencies seeking to buy the data from the collective efforts of the American people (hospitals and insurers paying patients - that would certainly be a welcome change).</p>
<p>Some might be concerned about Pricing Healthcare positioning itself to rely on data streams from third parties.  We are of course always looking for data sources to complement our user submissions, but our goal will always be to serve consumers.  We have no interest in taking money or data from third parties that seek to move us in any way from that primary focus.</p>
<p>Finally, unlike insurance carrier price estimate tools, PricingHealthcare.com doesn't need to keep a group of hospitals or providers happy by hiding what they charge or hiding what competitors charge.  Nor are we under contract to keep some prices secret, as large medical institutions often are.</p>
</div>
<div><strong>Do I need an account for each member of my family?<br/></strong></div>
<div style=""height: 4px;""> </div>
<div style=""padding-bottom: 20px;"">A family or household paying medical bills under one name will typically need only one subscription account.  We let you specify the patient for each medical bill item, so you can still track bills for specific family members.  Pricing Healthcare also lets you track payments for an aging parent that you are paying the bills for.  Our goal is to help your family simplify and lower their medical costs, not add to them.</div>
<div><strong>Is my subscription tied to my employer or my insurance?<br/></strong></div>
<div style=""height: 4px;""> </div>
<div style=""padding-bottom: 20px;"">No, and you won't have to learn a new pricing tool if you go to another state, or if you change jobs or insurance carrier.</div>
<div><strong>Can your team make this happen with just $70,000?<br/></strong></div>
<div style=""height: 4px;""> </div>
<div style=""padding-bottom: 20px;"">The $70k is to get us through a successful Beta launch and maybe 2-3 months (very lean months) of runway after that - not much more.  Our campaign’s stretch goal is $500,000, but if we only reach the $70k level, we will be seeking a larger raise from traditional investors after our June release.</div>
<div><strong>Will I be able to give someone access to my account with restricted privileges?<br/></strong></div>
<div style=""height: 4px;""> </div>
<div style=""padding-bottom: 20px;"">An early user has requested a feature, termed ""personal assistant access"", where others can access your account and do certain things, without them having full access.  This would be useful in letting another person or organization submit large numbers of medical bills and EOBs on your behalf. The team is taking this feature request under consideration.</div>

PricingHealthcare.com
Pricing Healthcare is busting the healthcare pricing market wide open, exposing the closely guarded pricing secrets of insurers and healthcare providers. We let consumers go to a single, easy-to-use website where they can compare procedure-level prices across all the healthcare facilities in their area.
If you’ve ever experienced the shock of an expensive medical bill, or known someone who has, then you understand the problem we’re trying to solve. Consumers have no recourse for outrageously high prices.  They want to know what they’re being billed for, what all of those procedure codes mean, if their bill is correct, and most importantly, if there's a place nearby that charges less.
There are lots of prices out there – list prices, insured rates, cash discounts.  We let people see all of it.  Nothing like this exists today.
 


 

The Solution (patent pending)

A number of companies have tried for years to convince hospitals and insurers to publish pricing data, but it's in the best interest of hospitals and insurers to keep this information secret.  Without this data, our competitors have been left to provide overly generalized estimates and very small fragments of the pricing picture, and have been unable to expose protected pricing data.
The data that could transform the healthcare industry is out there.  It’s sitting in our file cabinets and in the pile of bills on our kitchen counter. Our model is to help patients come together at the grass roots level, and anonymously share the pricing data from their healthcare bills.  That data is then combined and shown for your specific community, anywhere in the country.
Using our site is easy.  A user simply selects the facility listed on their bill, enters their primary insurance, then enters the service date, procedure code, and price charged from the bill details.  The site then displays descriptive information on the code, the lowest price for all payment types (including the average insured rate, the providers's retail and cash discount prices, and the medicare rate for the region), and names of the lowest-priced facilities in the area, with their prices.
Pricing Healthcare is pulling back the curtain on healthcare pricing by letting consumers anonymously share information from their bills online.  It's as simple as it is revolutionary.


Benefits
Consumers can save hundreds and thousands of dollars, comparing prices and finding the best healthcare at the lowest price.  Not only can patients choose to go to a lower-priced provider for big savings, but our information can also be used in trying to get a provider to lower the amount on your bill after the fact.  Pricing Healthcare also helps consumers find abnormalities and errors in their bills, such as double billing.  We save all the data you submit and provide you with a dashboard that allows you to see and manage your healthcare history.
Imagine what we could all do, collectively, with all the data from our healthcare bills anonymously online and freely available to other consumers.  Healthcare providers, like all American businesses, will have to compete on quality and price.
The rise in healthcare prices is one of America's biggest crises.  Nothing is more effective at lowering prices than good old-fashioned competition.  We can work together and make a huge difference, by exposing healthcare prices on a single site that is open to everyone.


 

Who We Are
We have a small, talented team of senior developers and a handful of top marketing and legal resources.  Most of us have had leadership roles on very large, enterprise-level projects at some of the biggest companies in America, and the founding members have worked together for years.
Randy, the founder and CEO, is also our chief architect and senior developer.  In addition to working for Intel, Microsoft, and HP, he has spent years building scalable web healthcare systems, and is passionate about making healthcare more affordable.
What We Need
We are just a couple months away from launching our public Beta (planned for June 2013).  Over the last year the Pricing Healthcare team has poured a lot of our savings and free time into this product.  In order to have a successful launch and reach a critical mass of people, we need additional funding for the following things.

A robust hosting environment: There are tens of thousands of codes with prices at hundreds of thousands of facilities in this country.  Our data set at launch time will be very large, and we need servers that can handle it.  Because our environment also has more complex security needs for things like HIPAA compliance, we can't get by with the cheap, smaller-scale hosting plans.
Supplemental data: We have opportunities to supplement portions of the pricing data, but that data has a price.
Outreach campaigns: The speed at which this site transforms the pricing landscape depends on getting information from a lot of people in a relatively short timeframe.  Additional funding will be carefully used to accelerate our outreach campaigns in targeted locations.

Your donations at any level will go toward these things.  We're asking for your help.
If you feel like you just can't contribute funds, we would love help getting the word out by mentioning our campaign in email and social media (see links to our pages below).  We also encourage you to use IndieGoGo share tools.
Donate Today
On behalf of our small team at Pricing Healthcare we thank you for your generous support as we bust healthcare pricing wide open.  We’ve tried to provide enticing rewards for your donations, but we know that the real reward comes in June 2013 when we launch our Beta and Americans can start comparing prices for the healthcare services that matter to them, at PricingHealthcare.com.

  Frequently asked questions
Can I use the site without submitting data from my bills?
 
Our success depends on individual contributions from within each community. All users are required to enter at least one line item (a medical code and a price) from one of their recent medical bills.
Why do you require medical codes?
 
Medical billing is done at the code level.  Comparing line items with the same text description from two different bills may not be an apples-to-apples comparison.  For example, there is a different code (at a higher price) used for seeing a physician at their office if you are a new patient vs. an established patient.  There are also different codes used depending on how long you talk to your physician.  You should be skeptical of anyone offering to give you a quote on medical services that doesn't mention these codes.
Do you get data from other sources?
 
Yes. We are regularly importing data from public and proprietary sources and expect that flow to increase over time. Medical offices and hospitals may submit their chargemasters directly to us to publish, and we expect more and more will want to do so, especially those at the lower end of the price spectrum.
Can my doctor's office use your site when recommending treatments?
 
Yes, and please ask the facilities you visit to use Pricing Healthcare. We are also creating products specifically for medical organizations with the intent of providing better care for consumers at a lower cost.
Won't lower-priced care generally result in lower-quality care?
 
There have been studies year after year attempting to find a correlation between price and quality of care, but there has never been any evidence found that paying more will result in higher quality care.
How does the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) affect this space?
 
The ACA focuses primarily on providing insurance to Americans who did not have it, and does not slow the rise in healthcare costs.  Prices are increasing for many under this plan.  Government subsidies will be used to control rising costs for the rest, which masks what the real prices are, burdens taxpayers, and becomes a huge incentive for fraud.
Don't most people have good health plans through their employer?
 
The number of Americans with employer-based health insurance has been declining for years, and is now well below 50% of the country.  In addition, employers are rapidly moving to plans that minimize future costs for the employer and place much of the burden on employees, either through high-deductible plans or by businesses getting out of employer health benefits altogether.
Once everyone's insured, don't we all just care about our in-network rates?
 
The CBO estimates after the ACA is fully in place, there will still be some 30 million Americans uninsured.  And as insurance-negotiated rates increase, there are actually a growing number of people finding that going outside the insurance system and paying cash rates saves them a lot of money.
I'm on Medicare - is this site for me?
 
Medical practices lose a lot of money on Medicare and Medicaid patients. Large numbers of providers are getting out of this business. If trends continue, it will become increasingly difficult, even in the next 5 years, to find practices that will take on new Medicare or Medicaid patients, leaving those consumers, many with lower-than-average incomes, to pay high list prices directly (or find very expensive insurance). Pricing Healthcare will help these consumers find quality care they can afford.
  Additional FAQs
How does this site help me save money?
 
Many patients are becoming aware of the huge price differences there can be between facilities in the same area for the same service.  The media is also beginning to cover the fact that paying the cash price can sometimes be a lot less than going through your insurance.  Getting this information over the phone is almost impossible, and there are no other web sites you can visit to get this information.  We show you apples-to-apples comparisons of all the prices at facilities that are close to you.  With that data at your fingertips you can find care at a lower cost.  And even for services you have already received, we give you information on codes and descriptions and competitive pricing to make you a more formidable negotiator if you wish to call and get your payments reduced.
Is your first loyalty to consumers? What are your revenue sources?
 

Our site is open to everyone, and independent of any provider, insurance carrier, or government entity.  At this time we are not planning to collect ad revenue.  Our revenue model includes a small annual subscription fee after Beta (currently targeting about $15 per year for consumers) to cover license fees and other costs so we don't have to have ads on our site.  This keeps our loyalties focused on patients.  Later revenue streams may include hospitals, insurance brokers, and government agencies seeking to buy the data from the collective efforts of the American people (hospitals and insurers paying patients - that would certainly be a welcome change).
Some might be concerned about Pricing Healthcare positioning itself to rely on data streams from third parties.  We are of course always looking for data sources to complement our user submissions, but our goal will always be to serve consumers.  We have no interest in taking money or data from third parties that seek to move us in any way from that primary focus.
Finally, unlike insurance carrier price estimate tools, PricingHealthcare.com doesn't need to keep a group of hospitals or providers happy by hiding what they charge or hiding what competitors charge.  Nor are we under contract to keep some prices secret, as large medical institutions often are.

Do I need an account for each member of my family?
 
A family or household paying medical bills under one name will typically need only one subscription account.  We let you specify the patient for each medical bill item, so you can still track bills for specific family members.  Pricing Healthcare also lets you track payments for an aging parent that you are paying the bills for.  Our goal is to help your family simplify and lower their medical costs, not add to them.
Is my subscription tied to my employer or my insurance?
 
No, and you won't have to learn a new pricing tool if you go to another state, or if you change jobs or insurance carrier.
Can your team make this happen with just $70,000?
 
The $70k is to get us through a successful Beta launch and maybe 2-3 months (very lean months) of runway after that - not much more.  Our campaign’s stretch goal is $500,000, but if we only reach the $70k level, we will be seeking a larger raise from traditional investors after our June release.
Will I be able to give someone access to my account with restricted privileges?
 
An early user has requested a feature, termed ""personal assistant access"", where others can access your account and do certain things, without them having full access.  This would be useful in letting another person or organization submit large numbers of medical bills and EOBs on your behalf. The team is taking this feature request under consideration.

<div>Jenn and Brian have been engaged since Valentines Day and were planning a big beautiful wedding for late summer 2013.  In late March, Jenn was diagnosed with an aggressive cancer (angiosarcoma of the breast) and we fear she will not be around long enough for a late summer wedding.

<div> </div>
<div>Before this campiagn began, we were seeking 100% of wedding costs to be covered in addition to Jenn's out of pocket medical treatments.

<p>Making the transition from fat guy to triathlete will require significant commitment - both physically and emotionally on my part. I'm a month away from being physically cabable of even beginning a training program. I understand there will be pain, and I am ready for it.The other commitment involved in making this transition is financial. Sponsors aren't exactly lining up behind someone who has never competed before - and someone in their mind who probably won't be able to. So, that's where Team Pat comes in... Each discipline requires gear, little of which I already have. To swim, I need a wetsuit, goggles, and a pool membership so I can train in the cold months. To bike, well... I need a bike, helmet, shoes, a bike rack, and probably other things I haven't thought of. To run, I need some compression socks. To compete in sanctioned events, I need to join USATriathlon.org. Believe me, I need every penny I can get. </p>

<p>1. For a $10 donation, you will receive a custom designed Team Pat wristband, so you can proudly show your suport.</p>
<p>2. A $25 donation gets you a Team Pat beer koozie plus the wristband.</p>
<p>3. For $100, you get the above items, plus a Team Pat t-shirt in a size of your choosing.</p>
<p>4. For a $250 donation, you can choose either a 16X9 Photo on Canvas print of an elephant (a picture I took in Tanzania) which I will number and sign.  OR  You can be a guest blogger on my blog, gmanofleisure.com, for a day. Just don't blog any hate...</p>
<p>5. I'm gonna throw this out there too... for a $20,000 donation, I will tattoo your company's logo (3X3) on my right shoulder. Really. </p>
<p>If we exceed our goal of $1,500 I will make a donation to the Animal Care Center of St. John, an INCREDIBLE animal clinic and adoption center that is completely supported through donations. Check out their site <a href=""http://stjohnanimalcarecenter.com/home"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://stjohnanimalcarecenter.com/home</a>. </p>
<p>I sincerely hope this journey becomes even bigger than one guy competing in triathlons. I am going to succeed. And I will have a story to tell. As a vegan and animal rights advocate, I will have the opportunity to spread information, share experiences, and make a difference. Also, I will be able to help so many people who are struggling with health issues, depression...people who can't figure out their own road. I am documenting my journey on my blog, and fully intend to write a book after I compete in my first Ironman event. My story will inspire others. Your help, at whatever level, will be a HUGE part of my success. I cannot thank you enough. </p>

3. For $100, you get the above items, plus a Team Pat t-shirt in a size of your choosing.
4. For a $250 donation, you can choose either a 16X9 Photo on Canvas print of an elephant (a picture I took in Tanzania) which I will number and sign.  OR  You can be a guest blogger on my blog, gmanofleisure.com, for a day. Just don't blog any hate...
5. I'm gonna throw this out there too... for a $20,000 donation, I will tattoo your company's logo (3X3) on my right shoulder. Really. 
If we exceed our goal of $1,500 I will make a donation to the Animal Care Center of St. John, an INCREDIBLE animal clinic and adoption center that is completely supported through donations. Check out their site http://stjohnanimalcarecenter.com/home. 
I sincerely hope this journey becomes even bigger than one guy competing in triathlons. I am going to succeed. And I will have a story to tell. As a vegan and animal rights advocate, I will have the opportunity to spread information, share experiences, and make a difference. Also, I will be able to help so many people who are struggling with health issues, depression...people who can't figure out their own road. I am documenting my journey on my blog, and fully intend to write a book after I compete in my first Ironman event. My story will inspire others. Your help, at whatever level, will be a HUGE part of my success. I cannot thank you enough. 


Believe me, I get that money is tight. If it wasn't, I wouldn't be on Indiegogo.com looking for help. If you can't donate, please spread the word... share of Facebook or Twitter, talk to your friends. And again, thanks!

<h3>My friends need help!</h3>
<p>Bev and Dave are two wonderful friends of mine who are both struggling with terminal illness.  Dave has an inoperable brain tumor, and Bev has Parkinson's disease, Fibromyalgia and COPD.  Bev was expected to die, and put on hospice, but recently recovered enough to be taken off--for now.  She has been in the hospital twice in the last two months.</p>
<p>They both live on Social Security ($1100 a month for each) and their rent is $875 dollars a month.  Both are worried that when the other one passes away, they will be unable to pay for their medications and other bills.  The best thing to do would be to move out into a cheaper apartment, but they are trapped by a $6,000 overdue electric bill.  They reached this point due to overwhelming medical bills and assisting their daughter, who has schizoaffective disorder.  Their daughter, Chrissy, now is on disability and does not need as much help.</p>
<p>Currently, the electric company allows them to pay $150 dollars a month towards the current bill (writing off $100 on the past due amount), but if they were to move out to a cheaper area, they would have to pay $500 dollars a month towards the bill.  The overdue electric bill currently makes moving nearly impossible, and adds even more stress to their lives.</p>
<p>They have applied for assistance and have been denied, gone to charities and churches, and currently owe relatives an additional $1000 dollars (the electricity was going to be shut off) that they are unable to pay back.</p>
<p>Bev has told me that she feels like she is ""drowning"" under all the financial stress.  She told me: ""I've been through the whole process of dying thing,"" but ""I'd like to feel like I'm not drowning.  I'd like to feel happy when I die.""</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What they need</h3>
<p>The current overdue electric bill with PP&amp;L is $6000 dollars, which is what I have listed as the needed funds for the campaign.  If any money is donated in addition, which they would be endlessly grateful for, it would be used for medical and moving expenses.  Bev needs $400 dollars for a copay on a test she needs.  She has Barrett's esophagus, and needs to be retested for cancer.  However, she currently cannot afford the test.  Dave has a referral to The New York Brain Tumor Center, and the VA will pay 100% of his costs--but none of hers if they have to stay over.  They need $800 for a moving van if they are able to move, which their nephew will drive for them.</p>
<p><strong>An Overview of Expenses</strong></p>
<p>Here is a partial list of bills that Bev and Dave pay:</p>
<p>+$2200 a month</p>
<p>-$875 rent<br/>-$150 electric current bill, plus any past due<br/>-$83 water<br/>-$100 propane for the stove<br/>-$72 trash<br/>-$145 other bills, including cable<br/>-$145 medicare and part D (taken out of both checks automatically (total: $290)<br/>-$50 phone and fax (which are needed for medical reasons)<br/>-$95 cost of seven prescriptions<br/>-$400 mail-order prescriptions not covered by medicare<br/>-around $100 over the counter medications not covered by medicare</p>
<p>That leaves hardly anything for gas to get to the doctors, other necessities, and food not available at the food bank. Dave doesn't have money to get dentures, and Bev's need to be repaired. It is an impossible situation!  It will become even more impossible when one of them passes, and the survivor receives $1100 a month.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Bev and Dave are caring, lovely people who are always thinking of other people.  Ever since I've known them, they have been loyal friends to me and helped me through immense difficulty.  If they could raise the $6000 dollars needed to pay off their electric bill, they could move into an apartment that costs half their current rent--with cheaper propane, water, etc. as well!  That would put them in a better financial situation and ease their stress.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you aren't able to help financially (I can't either, very much) it would be amazingly helpful to share this campaign with your friends, family, and around the internet.  I know that Bev and Dave would both appreciate it deeply.  Your prayers or thoughts are welcome.  Thank you for reading!</p>

<h3>Brian's Fight</h3>
<p>After a series of health problems, five months ago, Brian Chambers was diagnosed with esophageal cancer (cancer in the esophagus). This is very rare for a person only 35 years old, especially considering Brian has never smoked or drank in his life, which is usually the cause of this disease. Brian had a large tumor on his esophagus and under went weeks of chemo and radiation treatment to reduce the size of the tumor before having it removed. Last month, he was scheduled to have surgery to remove the tumor. Not long after the surgery began, doctors came out to tell the family the heartbreaking news, that although the tumor had shrunk, the cancer had unfortunately spread throughout his lymph nodes, so surgery was declined to keep his best quality of life.</p>
<p>Brian is still fighting the cancer, now at stage IV. The past five years have been hard on Brian and his family. Things have been extremely difficult especially after the heartbreak of losing his three month-old baby girl, Jewels, to SIDS in 2008, and the disappointment of a divorce a few years later.</p>
<p>Because of his sickness, on July 1st, Brian was terminated from his job at Cardinal IG where he had worked for 15 years, which also means he loses his health insurance...</p>
<br/><h3>Brian's Heart</h3>
<p>Brian has lived in or around the town of Greenfield, IA his entire life. Everyone in the area knows Brian. He has never been mean or unkind to anyone in his entire life. He loves his family and his little boy D'Vid and would do anything for them. He also loves Nodaway Valley athletics and has attended the events and always supported the teams and athletes. He was the one in the crowd always going wild with cheers of support.</p>
<p>Brian has never once hesitated to give when asked. He would give the shirt off his back if someone were in need of it.</p>
<p>It seems unfair that someone so kind-hearted would have to endure such struggle and heartbreak.</p>
<br/><h3>
<strong>Brian's Dream</strong><strong><br/></strong>
</h3>
<p>Anyone who knows Brian, knows that he's a huge NASCAR fan. He loves watching the races and watching Dale Jr. But Brian has never had the chance to go to an actual race.</p>
<p>This fundraising campaign is to help Brian's dream come true. Let's send him and his family to see a race and give him a chance to maybe even meet Dale Jr. himself. Brian has never once hesitated to show support to the community so lets return the favor and show Brian how much we care and appreciate him.</p>
<p>In his struggle and fight, let's give Brian something great to look forward to, and raise enough money so that Brian and his family can have the chance of a lifetime to go to a race together!</p>
<p>The funds will pay for: tickets for a two-day race, travel, lodging, and food for him and his family. Any additional or leftover money will go towards Brian's medical expenses.</p>
<p>Brian and his family are some of the most kind-hearted people to ever grace this earth! In this difficult time, let's show them the love and support they have always shown others!</p>

<p>Hi my name is Tristin MacLeod I am 9 years old and I race go-karts.  This is only my third year and I am kicking butt.  I have won a lot of races over these three years. I was offered a spot on a national team (CRG-USA) this year.  I have several wins and podiums since the year began.  I am currently third in the points standing for the SKUSA Rocky Mountain Region Series.  In this series I race kids that are older and more experienced than me, but I have been able to beat them.</p>
<p>I am trying to get to Indiana for a huge race the ROTAX Grand Nationals.  We had somewhat of a budget for this event, but with my dad’s job changing and us having to move it will be impossible without help. So my dad and I have put this together to see if I can still go. It is rushed we know and sorry for that.</p>
<p>This event host people from all over the world.  I may never get to do this again unless we get sponsors in the future.  Doing well at this race may really help with that.  The experience I would gain at this event would be invaluable for my racing future. I will learn so much. I want to go fast I just want to race. I put a little video up and will try to post a few of me driving I will also send some link of interviews and aticals I have been part of. Here is on of the lates. Copy and paste it in your browser if it doesn't open.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Where the money goes</strong></p>
<p>Tire sets run $248 per set and we will go through 3-4. Total $750 to $1000 roughly.</p>
<p>Air Fare we expect to be about $800 since we will have to book last minute.</p>
<p>Race entry fees are about $800.</p>
<p>Lodging for the week $400.</p>
<p>Kart transport to and from the event $500.</p>
<p>Tent fees $300</p>
<p>Parts for when things go wrong $700 (with luck this will be lower).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What you get</strong></p>
<p>Well we would love to give the world to any one for their help, but we are limited on our options.  So here are a few things we came up with.</p>
<p>$5        I will send you a thank you email.</p>
<p>$10      I will mail you a personal thank you note.</p>
<p>$25      I will mail you the thank you along with a racing photo</p>
<p>$100+  I will send the above along with your name and thanks on my Facebook page (this end up racing) and mention at a podium speech.</p>
<p>This all being said if you have a company and can afford to sponsor me please email me and we can discuss other option like name on driver suit, placement on kart, and even on our car.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>If we don’t reach our goal</strong></p>
<p>Well here’s hoping we do. If not we will see if we can make it on what we do raise, and what dad has.  If we can’t then we may extend the time frame and raise money for another huge event this November in Vegas with the SKUSA series. This is a cool event because it attracts people from around the world, including pro drivers from F1, NASCAR, and IRL. This event too would be huge for me.  So one way or another I will have a time to remember for life and learn ever so much.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact you will have</strong></p>
<p>Without your help I won’t be able to go.  I have learned and done so much in such a short time, this will just help increase my abilities.  I will work so hard.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>If you can’t contribute you can still help just by spreading the word about what I am doing. If you know someone who may sponsor me, let them know.</p>
<p>If you have a restaurant in town a meal would save us some money.</p>
<p>If you know a way we can get a hotel stay for free that helps us save too.</p>
<p>Any other ideas will be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thanks for any help and thanks to my dad for his help with this. (Yes he knows his pucuation, and things are not perfectJ).</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Like many people in America I am a single woman with inadequate medical coverage. The doctor says I need to have a hysterectomy, but I only have 1/2 the $4000 co-pay. It is sad that in ""the land of plenty"" the difference between life and death is $2000. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If I don't have the surgery I will just get sicker and sicker and the pathology that can be solved right now with a simple surgery will progress to needing chemo and other interventions that are even more expensive and put more of a burden on the health care system. In addition, I lose my quality of life, and my vitality and the world loses the impact that my joy and self expression has on them.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The total cost of the surgery to me is $8000. They will not perform the surgery without the $4000. I have $2000 of that so far. If I raise additional funds it will go to the remaining $4000 and after that I will use the money to pay for the expenses during the 2 weeks of unpaid leave I have to take for recovery.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I have done a good job of caring for other people and will continue to do so as I heal. Please pass my cause on to other people. Every little bit helps.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hello - we are the Meeks and Days - Bobby, Larisa, Annie and Trey Meeks and Louis, Madeline and Max Day.  We are a blended family in Memphis, TN.  We found out about the scripture memorization camp at a homeschool convention last year and thought that it would be a fantastic way for our family to grow as Christians this summer.  It takes place in Conway, AR from June 27 - July 1st.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The children are each learning 50 -100 verses (based on age/grade).</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We have decided to use this website as a tool to raise the funds to go to the camp and thank you for your consideration...</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We have seen our children grow spiritually over the past few months as they have dug into the scripture books.  All five children (as well as we parents) have been working to get the verses memorized and still have a ways to go.  This opportunity will forever etch God's word on the children's hearts.  Our prayer is that this will positively guide the children in their lives as they are presented with chances and choices to make God honoring decisions.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This camp is great - it offers learning series for preschoolers - adults (including a Collegiate Series).  The camp rules stress modest dress codes, NO ELECTRONIC DEVICES to distract kids and divide families, and it allows families to go to camp together!</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We are trying to cover the cost of the trip to camp through this web site.  </p>
<p>The base cost: </p>
<p>$800 = $650 for the family registration and $150 for gas</p>
<p>$300 = new tires for the van so we don't have to drive 400 miles on faith<br/></p>
<p>Above and beyond:</p>
<p>$???? - reward (all money over the goal will be divided amongst the children for completing the course)<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>NOTE: There is a small fee taken out by this site for processing the credit card payments - and PayPal charges a fee on top of that if you choose to pay via PayPal.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you want to pledge to the children that you will reward them directly for their success at camp when they return, please do so.  We should have some sort of ""score sheet"" that will tell how many verses they have memorized.  So it may motivate them well to be offered 25 cents a verse for example. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Also, please feel free to pass this site address along to anyone who may want to help us make this trip.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Thank you so much for your support...  </p>

<p>My Mother-in-Law, Enedina Barajas, is 67 years old and lives in Guadalajara, Mexico where she has lived for her entire life. She has recently been diagnosed with stage 4 Gastro-Intestinal cancer and now has a large, baseball-sized, tumor that needs to be removed. She also needs blood transfusions and Chemotherapy. Enedina has been admitted into a public, state funded medical center instead of a private hospital. The service and treatment in this facility is slow due to the physicians being overwhelmed with the sheer numbers of people crowded into the small rooms. The room Enedina is in has 8 other patients and the cleanliness of it is far below what most would call acceptable. Enedina's bed is small and she has said it's uncomfortable. Dried blood was seen on the floor of the room during the last visit and looked as though it had been there for some time. As of now, the process is very slow and frustrating because Enedina is continually losing weight and needs surgery and Chemotherapy as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Enedina is wonderful, charismatic woman who has raised four beautiful daughters and as a mother and friend has always been willing to help when she can and go without so others wouldn't have to. Things have never been easy financially for the family, but she has always  kept her head up and a smile on her face during difficult times. She has always thought keeping her family healthy and happy has been more important than how much money is made.  Enedina's husband, Candelario, and she have been together for over 45 years. He is a quiet man who, as an electrician, is frequently looking for work to help pay the bills and put food on the table.</p>
<p> Enedina's daughter, Brenda, and I live in Fort Collins, Colorado. Brenda has left her job and has gone to Guadalajara with our 11 month old daughter, Maya, to do anything she can to help her sick mother. This is the first time Enedina has seen her newest grandchild. I have stayed behind with our 3 year old boy so I can try to make a little extra money to help out as well. Brenda has two other sisters who are also doing everything possible to contribute to their mother's medical care. </p>
<p>The medical costs, even in the state run medical center, are far above what any of us can afford. Chemotherapy, for example, runs approximately $1500 per treatment and she needs a minimum of six treatments. Brenda is beside herself every time she calls to give me updates on her mother's progress. She knows she has to return to the United States soon and only wants to see that her mother is recieving the proper care for her illness before she has to leave.</p>
<p>We would be more than grateful for any donations received which would be directly forwarded to Enedina to help with the medical costs incurred. Thank you in advance for your kindness and generosity in helping us during this extremely difficult time.</p>

<h3 style=""margin-left: 120px;"">Daniel's Moving Assistance Fund</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>When I started Daniel's Power Chair Assistance Fund I had been fighting with Medicare vendors for EIGHT MONTHS. My doctor had been fighting right along with me, and all I was thinking about was <strong>getting a power chair</strong> before I feel and hurt myslef bad. </p>
<p>I <strong>failed</strong> to consider <strong>HOW</strong> I would get the power chair <strong>OUT </strong>of my apartment...</p>
<p>I <strong>failed </strong>to consider <strong>HOW </strong>I would get the power chair <strong>INTO</strong> my apartment...</p>
<h3><strong>ALONE</strong></h3>
<p><strong><br/>             </strong>When the fund hit $5,000.00 I was overjoyed! In addition, I started <strong>thinking</strong>. I started thinking about what I was going to do next. It quickly became very clear <strong>I didn't think this through.</strong> I live alone, and only have help a few times a week. </p>
<p>            Now I would have a way to get around town, but <strong>no way</strong> to get the chair <strong>down stairs.</strong> I cannot depend on others in the building. I worked, hard, to get people moved out of the building (because they brought 'unsavory' traffic into the building) and those left were cautious to mad at me. There was no way I would get help.</p>
<p>            As well, I would be a target in my new power chair, for anyone that had a problem with me helping get people evicted. So, my situation has become untenable, and I need help affording to move. This is when I realized my horrible mistake, and became scared and concerned.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align=""center""><strong>The Story</strong></p>
<p>            When I became disabled, I was working as a property manager for Domino Realty of Beverly Hills. I was unable to work, but I <strong>still lived on the property</strong>. The residents <strong>knew where I lived</strong>, and the management company did not hire anyone competent. They went through <strong>two managers</strong> in just one month. After that, <strong>all the residents</strong> would call me, or come by my apartment when something went wrong.</p>
<p><strong>            One night, at Two AM,</strong> I had a knock at my door. I opened it to find one of my residents. She was 22 years old and had just got off her shift at the UCLA hospital. She was a med student. She had lost her keys, and was locked out of her apartment. UCLA was having a problem with a rapist, on the campus. She did not want to sit outside the building (it was a secure building) and wait two hours for a locksmith to show up and let her into the building then her apartment.</p>
<p>            I helped her. I was <strong>not supposed to work </strong>but I just could not leave her alone in that situation. I let her into the building and then unlocked her front door. Two weeks later a fire alarm went off, in the building. I was watching as <strong>three fire trucks pulled up</strong>. But they could not get <strong>into the building</strong>. The management company forgot to put a ‘Knock Switch’ on the front gate. This ‘knock switch’ allows Police and Fire departments a way into <strong>secure buildings.</strong></p>
<p>            I walked up and let the firemen into the building. The fire chief, who was there on the property, told me</p>
<p><em>“You just saved your company a $5,000.00 fine. They should give you a raise!” </em></p>
<p>            Instead, the following Monday I was fired. Fired for <strong>“Insubordination and Working While Disabled”</strong>. When I was fired, I was also given an eviction notice. I was <strong>not</strong> given the chance to live there, I was given <strong>Three Days to move</strong>. I contacted the U.S. Department of  Labor and told I had a “case” for wrongful dismissal and they would help me because my employer was <strong>not </strong>offering <strong>FMLA </strong>leave for me or other workers. I was told to <strong>“fight the eviction, we will have your job back before you go to court”.</strong></p>
<p>            The Department of Labor did <strong>not</strong> help me; they helped <strong>everyone else</strong> at Domino. All <strong>future</strong> employees had to be covered by FMLA, but my case was dropped. I ended up getting evicted in October 2003. Now, when I go to try and rent, most property managers do not want to rent to me, and those who will want <strong>“Double Deposits and extra security deposits”</strong> just to rent to me. I have not been able to afford those steep costs, and have stayed where I am.</p>
<p align=""center""><strong>What I Need</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>$150 Electricity Deposit </strong>(I have not had electricity in my name for many years. This is what they require for me to get electricity in my name)</li>
<li>
<strong>$2,200.00 Rental Deposits – </strong>This is equal to ‘First and Last’ month’s rent. Average rent is $1,100.00 a month for a Bachelor to One Bedroom.</li>
<li>
<strong>$750 - $1,000.00 </strong>– For a ‘Security Deposit’. This would be on top of the ‘First and Last’</li>
<li>
<strong>$875 - $1,000.00 </strong>– For Moving me. I am incapable of moving anything beyond myself. I can try to find people, but I have few friends here, anymore. (Being disabled does that to friendships)</li>
</ul><p>That equals $3,975.00 - $4,350.00. I will set the funding goal of $4,000.00 and hope for the best.</p>
<p align=""center""><strong> </strong></p>
<p align=""center""><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p><strong>            </strong>I had a hard enough time, starting the <strong>first</strong> campaign and coming to people asking for assistance. This is <strong>no different</strong>. I don’t want to ask for help, but if I don’t or if I fail? I will have a power chair but; no way to get in and out on my own and in the building I am currently living in I will be a slow moving target in a $5,000.00 power chair. Most of you have <strong>seen</strong> the video of my abusive neighbor. She is one of the <strong>nice neighbors!</strong></p>
<p>            I would not be safe, here, in my power chair. There is no building security and no elevator. I need to be able to move to a Senior Building. Not an “Assisted Living” building, I am <strong>not</strong> asking for that much help. Just a senior building, something with an elevator and an older and more mature population, where I can be safe and get in and out on my own.</p>
<p>            The building I was looking at, and have talked to the manager, is just about two blocks from a small mall with a Wal-Mart and a Sears.

Daniel's Moving Assistance Fund
 
When I started Daniel's Power Chair Assistance Fund I had been fighting with Medicare vendors for EIGHT MONTHS. My doctor had been fighting right along with me, and all I was thinking about was getting a power chair before I feel and hurt myslef bad. 
I failed to consider HOW I would get the power chair OUT of my apartment...
I failed to consider HOW I would get the power chair INTO my apartment...
ALONE
             When the fund hit $5,000.00 I was overjoyed! In addition, I started thinking. I started thinking about what I was going to do next. It quickly became very clear I didn't think this through. I live alone, and only have help a few times a week. 
            Now I would have a way to get around town, but no way to get the chair down stairs. I cannot depend on others in the building. I worked, hard, to get people moved out of the building (because they brought 'unsavory' traffic into the building) and those left were cautious to mad at me. There was no way I would get help.
            As well, I would be a target in my new power chair, for anyone that had a problem with me helping get people evicted. So, my situation has become untenable, and I need help affording to move. This is when I realized my horrible mistake, and became scared and concerned.
 
The Story
            When I became disabled, I was working as a property manager for Domino Realty of Beverly Hills. I was unable to work, but I still lived on the property. The residents knew where I lived, and the management company did not hire anyone competent. They went through two managers in just one month. After that, all the residents would call me, or come by my apartment when something went wrong.
            One night, at Two AM, I had a knock at my door. I opened it to find one of my residents. She was 22 years old and had just got off her shift at the UCLA hospital. She was a med student. She had lost her keys, and was locked out of her apartment. UCLA was having a problem with a rapist, on the campus. She did not want to sit outside the building (it was a secure building) and wait two hours for a locksmith to show up and let her into the building then her apartment.
            I helped her. I was not supposed to work but I just could not leave her alone in that situation. I let her into the building and then unlocked her front door. Two weeks later a fire alarm went off, in the building. I was watching as three fire trucks pulled up. But they could not get into the building. The management company forgot to put a ‘Knock Switch’ on the front gate. This ‘knock switch’ allows Police and Fire departments a way into secure buildings.
            I walked up and let the firemen into the building. The fire chief, who was there on the property, told me
“You just saved your company a $5,000.00 fine. They should give you a raise!” 
            Instead, the following Monday I was fired. Fired for “Insubordination and Working While Disabled”. When I was fired, I was also given an eviction notice. I was not given the chance to live there, I was given Three Days to move. I contacted the U.S. Department of  Labor and told I had a “case” for wrongful dismissal and they would help me because my employer was not offering FMLA leave for me or other workers. I was told to “fight the eviction, we will have your job back before you go to court”.
            The Department of Labor did not help me; they helped everyone else at Domino. All future employees had to be covered by FMLA, but my case was dropped. I ended up getting evicted in October 2003. Now, when I go to try and rent, most property managers do not want to rent to me, and those who will want “Double Deposits and extra security deposits” just to rent to me. I have not been able to afford those steep costs, and have stayed where I am.
What I Need


$150 Electricity Deposit (I have not had electricity in my name for many years. This is what they require for me to get electricity in my name)

$2,200.00 Rental Deposits – This is equal to ‘First and Last’ month’s rent. Average rent is $1,100.00 a month for a Bachelor to One Bedroom.

$750 - $1,000.00 – For a ‘Security Deposit’. This would be on top of the ‘First and Last’

$875 - $1,000.00 – For Moving me. I am incapable of moving anything beyond myself. I can try to find people, but I have few friends here, anymore. (Being disabled does that to friendships)
That equals $3,975.00 - $4,350.00. I will set the funding goal of $4,000.00 and hope for the best.
 
Conclusion
            I had a hard enough time, starting the first campaign and coming to people asking for assistance. This is no different. I don’t want to ask for help, but if I don’t or if I fail? I will have a power chair but; no way to get in and out on my own and in the building I am currently living in I will be a slow moving target in a $5,000.00 power chair. Most of you have seen the video of my abusive neighbor. She is one of the nice neighbors!
            I would not be safe, here, in my power chair. There is no building security and no elevator. I need to be able to move to a Senior Building. Not an “Assisted Living” building, I am not asking for that much help. Just a senior building, something with an elevator and an older and more mature population, where I can be safe and get in and out on my own.
            The building I was looking at, and have talked to the manager, is just about two blocks from a small mall with a Wal-Mart and a Sears. This will help a lot with getting prescriptions and food and sundries. It also has a movie theater, and it has been more than eight years since I have sat in a theater and watched a movie.
            I am sorry. I am sorry that I didn’t think about everything I would need when I started Daniel’s Power Chair Assistance Fund. I am sorry that I have to ask for your assistance, again. I am sorry, but I do need your help, again. I have every intention to:

Provide documentation of HOW all monies from BOTH  campaigns are spent
Continue to keep everyone updated on my condition 
Keep writing the stories I am sharing well into the fall… and beyond
Never EVER forget what everyone has done to help me
Use any extra money JUST for medical needs or things like pots and pans
IF you decide to assist me, I will be forever in your debt. I will never forget what people  have done for me, and I promise to ‘Pay it Forward’.

Alzheimer's disease is becoming increasingly relevant due to our growing aging population. We have made breakthroughs in the treatments of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes and now people are living longer than ever before, which is incredible! However, it also means that the cases of dementia are on the rise.</span></span></h3>

This disease costed society USD $604 billion in 2010 due to the lack of treatments available. Additionally, immense amounts of pressure are put on carers and this disease has a broad impact on society because it affects the patient but also the people caring for them. </span><br/></span></h3>

<p>A major problem is that most diagnostics and therapeutics cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. The blood-brain barrier is a protective barrier that restricts the substances that are allowed to enter into the brain. To overcome this, current drugs are administered through a lumbar puncture (spinal puncture) which is very invasive and risky. One technique being developed to cross the blood-brain barrier is to use transferrin receptors. Their normal function is to get iron into cells, and because the brain needs iron too, they are able to get through the barrier.</p>

</div></div>","Hey there, I'm Krtin Nithiyanandam, I'm 15 years old and I live in Epsom, UK. I'm very interested in science and I have been doing a lot of science projects in my spare time. 

Last year, while I was off school for three months after fracturing my hip, I got the chance to work on a project for the earlier diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease. I ended up creating a bispecific antibody conjugated to a quantum dot, which has both diagnostic and therapeutic potential. This is an antibody that is specific to two different antigens (targets) and which is also bound to a nanoparticle that shows up on an MRI and fNIR scan. The nanoparticle also immobilises the toxic Aβ protein and displays therapeutic potential. 
I received international recognition by winning the Scientific American Innovator Award at the Google Science Fair.  




About Alzheimer's Disease

Alzheimer's disease is a debilitating disease that impairs memory and it is notorious for the fact that there are no drugs to stop or even slow down the progression of the disease. Alzheimer's disease is becoming increasingly relevant due to our growing aging population. We have made breakthroughs in the treatments of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes and now people are living longer than ever before, which is incredible! However, it also means that the cases of dementia are on the rise.
There are approximately 8 million new cases each year and this disease affects over 44 million people worldwide, with that set to triple in the next 30 years - therefore it is so important that new discoveries are being made in the field to find new treatments for this disease. This disease costed society USD $604 billion in 2010 due to the lack of treatments available. Additionally, immense amounts of pressure are put on carers and this disease has a broad impact on society because it affects the patient but also the people caring for them. 


My Research 


Current diagnostic approaches identify amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques, which are present during the later stages of Alzheimer's disease after the onset of symptoms. I realised there was a necessity for an earlier diagnostic tool and decided to investigate further.


Aβ oligomers are the precursors to the plaques and are present in much higher concentrations in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients. This increase appears during the earliest stage of the disease, making Aβ oligomers an attractive biomarker. However, there are other species of Aβ, many of which are present in cognitively healthy people, therefore it is important that only the oligomeric Aβ  is detected to avoid misdiagnosis. 



A major problem is that most diagnostics and therapeutics cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. The blood-brain barrier is a protective barrier that restricts the substances that are allowed to enter into the brain. To overcome this, current drugs are administered through a lumbar puncture (spinal puncture) which is very invasive and risky. One technique being developed to cross the blood-brain barrier is to use transferrin receptors. Their normal function is to get iron into cells, and because the brain needs iron too, they are able to get through the barrier.



I engineered a molecular 'Trojan Horse' that binds to Aβ oligomers and transferrin receptors so it has the potential to cross the blood-brain barrier and bind with the toxic Aβ oligomers. This is the bispecific antibody section of the compound. I also synthesised a quantum dot which would be bound to the bispecific antibody, ultimately creating the therapeutic compound. 



I performed surface plasmon resonance to estimate their affinity to Aβ oligomers and to transferrin receptors (TfRs). The molecular compounds' cross-reactivity with various other species of Aβ was also determined.                


The molecular compound exhibited optical properties that were suitable for non-invasive imaging by means of fNIR and MRI, allowing for multimodal diagnosis. These molecular 'Trojan Horses' have the potential to cross the blood-brain barrier and be used as a sensitive, minimally-invasive tool for the earlier diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease. Additionally, the synthesised molecular compound displayed therapeutic properties by immobilising the toxic Aβ oligomers and increasing the viability of surrounding neurones. 
I am  also developing this molecular compound so it can potentially be used for the minimally-invasive diagnosis and treatment of other neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease which begins with amyloid abnormalities and thus could help millions of people worldwide.

Since then, I have presented this at the World Extreme Medicine Conference and it received a positive response from doctors and industry experts.

What We Need




The majority of the funding for my drug to move forwards has already been secured however I need to raise £30,000 to ensure that all the necessary costs are satisfied. 



The funding will be required for the chemical synthesis of the drug and also some of the money will go towards the purchase of antibody samples and cell cultures, which are inevitably expensive due to their extraction and purification procedures. Additionally, funding will be necessary to prepare solutions and buffers required for the synthesis of the quantum dots. All the necessary preparations required before and during trials also require funding because the bispecific antibody conjugated to quantum dots will need to be synthesised on a larger scale than they were being synthesised previously.  By helping to progress my project via funding, I can bring it to trials sooner and you will be playing a part in ensuring that my drug could be helping patients sooner.  



Additionally, computer software will also need to be used for the simulation of drug interactions in an in vivo model and to collate the data in appropriate formats, such as a non-linear curve regression for affinity analysis. Computer software with such capabilities also have attached costs and some of the funding will go towards the purchase of the software that will enable us to conduct research. 



I am asking for this through crowdfunding so all the proceeds can go directly to my project as opposed to applying for a grant where I only receive about 50%-60% of the funding. The funding will go to ARUK. 



Any extra funding would mean I do more research however if the funding goal isn't reached, I will still put the money into carrying out the research but the research I can carry out will not be as substantial as it could be and it will take longer for my research to reach trials.

The Impact

Alzheimer's is a cruel disease and anybody who has had a loved one struck by this disease will understand its truly cruel consequences. Alzheimer's disease affects people on a global scale, with over 44 million people affected right now. This disease is considered to be one of the greatest medical challenges of the 21st century and more research and awareness of this disease is important in the fight against it. By helping me to take my research into trials, it means that you will also be a part of the fight against dementia and ensure that newer discoveries are being made at a faster rate, to ensure that people have the best chances of survival from this  disease.

 

Risks
As always, there will be risks with the project. The research so far has been acknowledged by different professionals and has been presented at international conferences, with the general consensus being the research is very valid. Health and safety is a key priority and that is why I will always have to undergo substantial health and safety training and be supervised by a researcher.
We will not be sure that the drug works until the trials begin; I need your backing for this! Nevertheless, the results achieved so far have opened a gateway for new neurodegenerative research and will pave a way for the development of neurodegenerative drug design. These results will feed into other work being done by scientists around the world so we can develop better tools to fight dementia.

<p>The Amber Jewel and our App makes it easy for the police to quickly find your child and rescue them from possible harm or worse…</p>
<p>By joining this Indiegogo project at any pledge level, you could

<p><b>Who is it for?</b></p>
<p>Parents and Grandparents who want to significantly reduce the
risk of their (grand)child being abducted.</p>
<p><b>Why?</b></p>
<p>According to the statistics, by the time you finish reading this Indiegogo, approximately
4 kids will be taken from their families... <br/></p>
<p>...About now, a parent has
discovered their child is missing and is going through an emotional

<p>Our goal is to make it next to impossible for people like
Ariel Castro to get away with abducting, sexually assaulting and beating children, or worse. Had the technology existed just a decade ago, we’re confident those poor girls
would have quickly and easily been rescued and Ariel sent to jail then.</p>
<h1>How Amber Jewel Works</h1>
<p>Amber Jewel is easy to use and set up. Disguised as a necklace or a watch, or even hidden in your child's clothing, the Amber Jewel can be triggered in a
number of ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>If a
     perpetrator tries to pull the Amber Jewel off.</li>
<li>If a
     kidnapper attempts to cut the Amber Jewel off.</li>
<li>If the
     child activates the device via the special SOS button.</li>
<li>If the battery dies <i>(it warns you when the battery is low so you can recharge it)</i>.</li>
<li>If you
     have remotely triggered the device.</li>
<li>If a
     parent has logged into the secure website to report an abduction.</li>
<li>If
     your child has left the “safe zone” you’ve created in the App.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the Amber Jewel has been activated, the device’s
location is “pinged” and within a matter of minutes, your child’s coordinates will be relayed to you with ongoing updates in real time to give to your local police.<br/></p>
<p>By radically speeding up the location process, an abducted
child has a better chance of being returned unharmed thanks to the Amber Jewel
device.</p>
<h1>How the App Works to Help Keep Your Child Safe and Give You Peace of Mind </h1>
<p>The Amber Jewel “Safe Zone” App offers you complete
flexibility and control in setting up real-time alarms to inform you when your
child leaves a safe zone (like school, the park or a friend's house) when they
shouldn’t. You will also be able to set time-based rules for when your child
should be inside or outside each zone. </p>
<p>The App also provides you with other valuable information
and alerts such as low battery life alerts.</p>

<span class=""notranlsate""><h1>My Story</h1>
<p>A few months ago I was in a business meeting where I had
turned my ringer off. After the meeting was over, I checked my messages as I
normally do to discover a voice mail message from my 8-year-old daughter saying
mom was sick so she was walking to school on her own.</p>
<p>I immediately jumped into my car and headed toward the
school hoping and praying I’d find her walking to the school. </p>
<p>Fortunately this story has a happy ending and I found her a
mile down the street from the house. She had still crossed a major six lane
intersection before I could get to her. But the stress… the scary, horrific
thoughts and scenarios wouldn’t stop running through my mind. And that’s what
got me thinking: </p>
<p><i>“What if there was a way for me to keep track of my
daughter’s location and if she went ‘out of bounds’ or left the “safe zones” I
set up, I would get a text notification right away so I could check up and make
sure everything was okay?”</i></p>
<p>Like every good parent, this would give me so much peace of
mind in a world gone crazy.</p>
<p>But after scouring the Internet I couldn’t find anything
that was remotely good enough. Everything I found was either outrageously
expensive or worse, easily recognized and quickly removed by a kidnapper,
thereby defeating the purpose of the device.</p>
<p>Enter the Amber Jewel.</p>
<p>We all know <b>time is of the essence when it comes to
rescuing kidnap victims</b>.</p>
<p>I shared the idea with a few of my friends and they all
agreed – it’s a brilliant idea, but if the Amber Jewel became popular; then
would-be abductors would eventually figure out a way to remove it and get away
with the child.</p>
<p>So I went back to the drawing board and came up with what I
believe to be a brilliant solution:</p>
<p>What if the Amber Jewel was small enough to be put into a
shoe? </p>
<p>Or hidden or sewn into a piece of clothing? Etc…</p>
<p>This would mean the only people who would know about it
would be you – the parent!</p>
<p>Or better yet, what if the necklace or watch wasn’t easily removable
by force? Or if it was removed, you immediately got a text alert along with GPS
coordinates?</p>
<p>All my friends agreed that I’m on the right track with the
Amber Jewel.</p>
<p>So I’ve turned to Indiegogo to help me realize this idea and
bring it to market so we can help put an end to child abductions once and for
all.</p></span></span></span></span></span><h2><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><h1><span class=""notranlsate""><p>Where are we in development?</p></span></h1></span></span></span></span></h2>

Our goal is to expedite the process of locating a missing
child and to deter criminals and lowlifes from snatching kids in the first place. 
Upon activation, the Amber Jewel will send you (the parent)
an update every few minutes with the coordinates of your child. 
You can also view you child's location anytime in real-time.
Or, using our simple App, you can quickly set up ""Safe Zones"" with times and locations and Amber Jewel will notify you if your child leaves the designated zone when they shouldn't.

According to the statistics, by the time you finish reading this Indiegogo, approximately
4 kids will be taken from their families... 
...About now, a parent has

roller coaster of terror, fear and worse…
Our goal is to make it next to impossible for people like
Ariel Castro to get away with abducting, sexually assaulting and beating children, or worse. Had the technology existed just a decade ago, we’re confident those poor girls

If a

If a

If the

If the battery dies (it warns you when the battery is low so you can recharge it).
If you
     have remotely triggered the device.
If a
     parent has logged into the secure website to report an abduction.
If
     your child has left the “safe zone” you’ve created in the App.

<p>Over the past 8 years I have traveled the globe and inspired thousands of people from these groups and more to exercise by wearing rebound sport shoes, a low impact alternative to running shoes that allow you to burn over 25% more calories during fitness activities, drastically increase your VO2Max, and reduce up to 80% of the bone-jarring shock absorbed by your ankles, knees, hips and back.  Stimulating your lymphatic system when in use, rebound sport shoes motivate you to exercise longer, harder and more frequently.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/58847/files/20130907081547-Plyo_Air_Glides_Kangoo_Jumps-17.png?1378566947"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Originally developed for rehabilitation purposes, by neurophysiologist and heart rate monitor inventor Gregory Lekthman, rebound sport shoes evolved in theory and design until 1994, at which point the product's evolution stopped. Current rebound sport shoes do not offer features that allow users to stop, stabilize, or prevent them from falling and this has inhibited the movement's growth. Although I have been successful fueling the movement across the globe, the time has come for me to evolve, improve, and forge this amazing concept into elite fitness tools that will engage, excite, and elevate fitness levels worldwide.</p>

<p>To eliminate the fear of falling and encourage more people to adapt the movement, I have developed Air Glide Mario™, the world’s first hybrid rebound sports shoe with a robust menu of advanced safety features and innovative technical improvements that will fundamentally change the exercise experience. Air Glide Mario™ is the opening model of the new rebound sport shoe brand, Plyo Air Glides™. By creating an accessible fleet of models with different functionalities suited for various demographics, I hope to inspire millions of athletes and fitness enthusiasts as well as injured, overweight and sedentary people to exercise, stay motivated and enjoy a more effective regime without the fear of falling that was once associated with rebound sports shoes.</p>

<p>Marking the rebound sport shoe category’s first innovative product launch since 1994, Air Glide Mario™ will enable us to change the lives of millions around the world with your support from this Indiegogo campaign. Air Glide Mario™ is patent pending and our goal is to raise $50,000. The funds will be used for additional prototypes to test out and fine tune resistance options for users of various weights, the initial molds for the 5 category classes of sizing, to support our patent filing with the EPO to help protect our product abroad, to meet minimum order quantity requirements of proposed US manufacturers, and to jump start our headquarters which will also serve as a fitness studio and store front to centralize and foster our air glide community as well as enable people to try our product before purchasing. The more funds that we can raise for this project, the faster that we will be able to get the opening model to market and start designing other models in our fleet.</p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The elliptical spring of rebound sport shoes delays the shock you experience when your foot hits the ground providing a soft comfortable run and a greater workout (up to 3 times) in less time than wearing traditional shoes. Muscles can’t be exercised by shock because they can’t act quickly enough to absorb all the kinetic energy of running and high impact exercise. Up to 75% of this kinectic energy is absorbed by our skeletal structure which leads to the gradual wearing out of bones, joints, and ligaments. When the spring is compressed the kinetic energy is absorbed, stored, and converted to potential return energy that can be utilized in a variety of ways that serves as a “kick back” either increasing the running speed, upward acceleration, or forward locomotion with less effort for the user.</span><br/></p>

<p></p>
<p>When traditionally jumping, hopping, or leaping you biomechanically have to drop down into a hip and knee flexed position (squat) to initiate and continue jumping, hopping, or leaping. When Air Gliding you can isometrically contract stiffening your core and leg muscles from a 0 degree hip and knee flexed position (straight legs) to create your own kinetic energy that can propel you vertically and/or horizontally.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/58946/files/20130907085627-Plyo_Air_Glides_Kangoo_Jumps-50.jpg?1378569387"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Based on science, biomechanics, and the laws of physics I have created the technical terminology “Air Gliding.” Air Gliding is a mobile version of rebounding not restricted to a stationary fixed position (trampoline) and is focused on the perspective of movement that happens in the air because the user is in the air more than they are touching the ground. In order to glide there needs to be an absence of friction which only happens while airborne in rebound sport shoes with the potential to Air Glide™ up to 10,000 times an hour.</p>

<h1>&gt;&gt; HOW WILL IT HELP?</h1>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>ARE YOU INJURED?</b> Using rebound sport shoes is scientifically proven to reduce up to 80% of the impact to your joints and back. People with knee and hip replacements, bad knees, scoliosis, herniated discs, and many other injuries sensitive to impact have been able to run and exercise again at a high intensity. Plyo Air Glides™ will get almost all injured people running and exercising again due to the impact absorption of the shoe and eliminate the risk of damaging, aggravating, or re-injuring joints, muscles, and ligaments that are weakened by overuse or reconstructive surgery.</span><br/>
</li></ul>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>ARE YOU OVERWEIGHT OR OBESE?</b> Using rebound sport shoes is scientifically proven to burn over 25% more calories, stimulates your lymphatic system flushing excess water weight and toxins, reduces cellulite, and increases your metabolic rate making you burn more calories at rest.  In addition you will feel light on your feet and the massive endorphin rush and lower perceived exertion will make you want to work out longer, harder, and more often with no pain to your joints.</span><br/>
</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/59008/files/20130907092552-Plyo_Air_Glides_Kangoo_Jumps-49.jpg?1378571152"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>ARE YOU SEDENTARY?</b> A sedentary lifestyle is an excessive amount of daily sitting whether it be watching TV, working on a computer, or even reading. Sitting for an extended period of time makes your body start to shut down at the metabolic level, circulation is slowed, and fewer calories are burned as well as other negative health influences including increased anxiety, damaging your mind, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, depression and more. Plyo Air Glides™ are easy to use, fun, and the euphoric thrill will motivate anyone naturally off the couch combating all of those symptoms and will never make you want to sit.</span><br/>

<p></p>
<ul><li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>ARE YOU A FITNESS ENTHUSIAST?</b> Rebounding is an exercise that reduces your body fat; firms your arms, legs, thighs, abdomen, and hips; increases your agility; strengthens your muscles overall; provides an aerobic effect for your heart; rejuvenates your body when it's tired, and generally puts you in a state of health and fitness. People who rebound find they are able to work longer, sleep better, and feel less tense and nervous. The effect is not just psychological, because the action of bouncing up and down against gravity, without trauma to the musculoskeletal system, is one of the most beneficial aerobic exercises ever developed.  Plyo Air Glides™ is a concentrated and evolved form of rebounding enabling you to get maximum benefits in less time with a reduced chance of injury.</span><br/>
</li></ul>
<p><br/></p>
<ul><li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>ARE YOU AN ATHLETE?</b> In order to be your best you must train harder, faster, and frequently. Because of this you have a high percentage risk of overuse, recurring, and career ending injuries.  Rebound sport shoes are scientifically proven to reduce up to 80% of the impact shock to your ankles, shins, knees, hips, lower back, and spine, reduces injuries, and allows athletes to resume their workouts and training much sooner. In addition studies have found that it's 68% more efficient, you increase your VO2 Max by 18.3%, and 25% increased oxygen uptake and calorie burn. Rehabilitation time compromises muscle control and strength, endurance, proprioception, and balance. Plyo Air Glides™ keeps you in the game by preventing and reducing injuries and reduces your time on the sidelines by accelerated healing of sports relating injuries and limiting the risk of aggravating or damaging joints that are weakened by overuse or reconstructive surgery.</span><br/>

<h1>&gt;&gt; KNOWLEDGE IS POWER</h1>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Because of the knowledge and skill level I posses, I have become the most successful, visually known, and sought after rebound sport shoe trainer in the entire world. I can sprint up to speeds of 30 MPH, effortlessly jump over 7 feet high, and posses an uncanny sense of proprioception that allows me to fearlessly race cars, buses, and taxi's in the streets of NYC.</p>

<p></p>
<p>One of the big drawbacks of rebound sport shoes currently is that people use them without properly knowing how to utilize them and only do the basic running, jumping, and other easy exercises using only momentum that may look novel, monotonous, and bland. Using them is also counter-intuitive bio-mechanically and if you aren't using the proper technique, you will hurt yourself.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/59037/files/20130907093746-MarioGodivaFly2.jpg?1378571866"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Using my 8 years of experience, knowledge, and skill based on an application of Newton's Third Law of action and reaction, I have created a specific training technique called SELF-PROPULSION TECHNIQUE™. SELF-PROPULSION TECHNIQUE™ teaches you the ""how"", ""why"" and ""how to apply"" this specific technique to give you complete control, precision, and advanced measurable results. Instead of solely relying on momentum it teaches you how to create, utilize, and maximize your own momentum and kinetic energy in rebound sport shoes.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Each product will come standard with an ""Air Gliding 101"" SELF-PROPULSION TECHNIQUE™ training DVD video to properly train consumers how to safely, efficiently, and effortlessly use Plyo Air Glides™.  We want users to fully understand how to utilize our product so that they look amazing while using it and are maximizing their benefits and results.</p>

<p>I’m Fitness Expert and CEO of Plyo Air LLC Mario Godiva and I’ve been active in the fitness industry for over 13 years. Early 2006 I discovered rebound sport shoes, sought out training, became certified, and became the first person to pioneer rebound sport shoe fitness classes in the US, Turkey, and Russia. No one took me seriously, everyone thought it was a gimmick, and everyone laughed at me. But for every person that told me “no” I would eventually find someone that would tell me “yes” and it ended up changing their life and inspiring them to exercise. Little did I know that for the next 8 years I would be traveling the world motivating, inspiring, and changing the lives of thousands of people.</p>
<p></p>

<p>I have been a rebound sport shoe dealer, personal trainer, instructor, master trainer training others how to use them, international presenter at fitness conventions, and an official spokesmodel for the rebound sport shoe concept for 8 years, been featured in over 100 international, national, &amp; local TV, print, and media interviews as well as have over 300 of my own videos (many of them viral) on youtube, vimeo, etc, have been a rebound sport shoe prototype tester giving feedback and improvements for rebound sport shoes before they came out to market, and for 8 years have almost used rebound sport shoes daily in the field with thousands of people across the globe. Suffice to say I know a thing or two about rebound sport shoes. ;-)</p>

<p></p>
<p>The foundation for my success with rebound sport shoes is relying on 'guerilla marketing' tactics, grassroots activities, and social media.  I never had any budget to work with so I got creative and depended solely on aggressive, unorthodox, and inexpensive methods to get rebound sport shoes into the public eye.  I equated using rebound sport shoes with a fun, active, sexy, and trendy lifestyle. I sent rebound sport shoes to producers, celebs, athletes, and established many cross promotional tie-ins with various companies.  </p>

<p></p>
<p>Most importantly I always took rebound sport shoes out on the streets and gave many opportunities for people to see and try them. I would do outdoor Plyo Dance™ classes in parks, fairs, festivals, concerts, college campuses, and other outdoor events. Where ever I knew a lot of people would gather I would be there with my team.</p>

<h1>&gt;&gt; THE IDEA &amp; WHERE WE ARE AT</h1>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Despite my visual success and spearheading the rebound sport shoe movement across the globe, it still hasn't caught on with the majority of people. After noticing no real desire to further innovate the product in the category, I decided to take matters in my own hands and assembled a dream team that could not only design an innovative game changing product, but be able change the image and bring the science and information to the majority of people's eyes and ears.  Here is a breakdown of events:</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/59114/files/20130907101139-The_Creative_Brainstorm.png?1378573899"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">December 2012 we brainstormed about our product, it's image, and targeted demographics.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We analyzed current products to see what was working and what needed to be improved and researched new fitness and footwear trends.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We decided that everything with our product including terminology should be technical, politically correct, and based on physics and biomechanics.</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/59115/files/20130907101236-Plyo_Air_Glides_RollerBlade_Graph.png?1378573956"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We knew rollerblades had a similar journey with challenges and we brainstormed and researched the evolution of rollerblades to gauge what type of product we could start with and what type of other models that we could create to make a fleet of innovative, advanced, and functionality driven products.</span><br/>
</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/59118/files/20130907101324-Plyo_Air_Glides_Initial_Sketches.png?1378574004"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul><li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We created, analyzed, and went through a variety of sketches, functionalities, and finally settled upon a mid-range design that would be the opening model, Air Glide Mario™.</span></li></ul>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We wanted to patent it and it's advanced features. We questioned what our product could do that all the other current products couldn't do that would keep us ahead of the game as more and more people caught on to the concept.</span><br/>

<p></p>
<ul><li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We wanted the product's rebound spring to be removable and for the top boot to function as a walking shoe.  After testing many homemade prototype parts and features we settled upon the sliding and locking technique as the most stable and easy method.</span><br/>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We knew we had to take the common fear of falling head on and so we came up with the anti fall safety edge and tested a homemade prototype to make sure it would actually work.</span><br/>
</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/59132/files/20130907102331-Plyo_Air_Glides_Kangoo_Jumps-03.jpg?1378574611"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>We are in the prototype testing phase and testing the models out for functionality, safety, and quality. Resistance is a primary factor of the experience and many more prototypes are needed to test out on users with various weights and injuries to create a customize-able resistance guide. Part of the money we are raising is for additional prototypes to test every single demographic that we are targeting so that we can communicate exactly what type of resistance is needed due to age, injury, weight, etc. After consistent testing of the prototypes is completed we will engineer the final rendering and send to one of our manufacturers to produce.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Plyo Air Glides™ will be a world wide brand with international distribution and because of that we would like to file a patent with the European Patent Office (EPO). This is a lengthy multi-step process and part of the funds raised will assist us in being able to file and protect our product abroad.</span><br/></p>
<p>We would like the production to happen in the US to help promote the US economy and prevent illegal copying of our innovative and advanced product. We have requested quotes from several plastic injection molding and product outsourcing companies across the country, and are confident that this business model will work. There are several plastic injection molding companies that are offering competitive prices to combat work being sent to China and we want to support them by having them create a high quality, premium, and US engineered product.</p>
<p>In order to make this happen and keep this work in the US we need the help of the Indiegogo community in order to cover costs and meet the minimum order requirements of our US manufacturing partners. If we meet our funding goal of $50,000 we will be properly capitalized (i.e. ""have enough money"") to officially start the production process of the opening model Air Glide Mario™ of Plyo Air Glides™.</p>

>>THE ISSUES




In the US:






213 million adults and 23.9 million children are overweight or obese
 Up to 79% of 51 million runners and recreational joggers are injured yearly; 20% to 70% of those injuries are recurring
23.9% of adults live a sedentary lifestyle and do no physical activity besides work and it's one of leading causes of preventable death
Current fitness solutions from running, to cross-fit, to hot yoga and spin haven’t been able to connect with these groups

Fitness enthusiasts often plateau and jump from fad to fad in search of real, long lasting, and measurable physical and mental results


Athletes trainer harder to reach peak performance only to get injured due to impact, overuse, and recurring injuries





>>THE SOLUTION





Over the past 8 years I have traveled the globe and inspired thousands of people from these groups and more to exercise by wearing rebound sport shoes, a low impact alternative to running shoes that allow you to burn over 25% more calories during fitness activities, drastically increase your VO2Max, and reduce up to 80% of the bone-jarring shock absorbed by your ankles, knees, hips and back.  Stimulating your lymphatic system when in use, rebound sport shoes motivate you to exercise longer, harder and more frequently.


Originally developed for rehabilitation purposes, by neurophysiologist and heart rate monitor inventor Gregory Lekthman, rebound sport shoes evolved in theory and design until 1994, at which point the product's evolution stopped. Current rebound sport shoes do not offer features that allow users to stop, stabilize, or prevent them from falling and this has inhibited the movement's growth. Although I have been successful fueling the movement across the globe, the time has come for me to evolve, improve, and forge this amazing concept into elite fitness tools that will engage, excite, and elevate fitness levels worldwide.





To eliminate the fear of falling and encourage more people to adapt the movement, I have developed Air Glide Mario™, the world’s first hybrid rebound sports shoe with a robust menu of advanced safety features and innovative technical improvements that will fundamentally change the exercise experience. Air Glide Mario™ is the opening model of the new rebound sport shoe brand, Plyo Air Glides™. By creating an accessible fleet of models with different functionalities suited for various demographics, I hope to inspire millions of athletes and fitness enthusiasts as well as injured, overweight and sedentary people to exercise, stay motivated and enjoy a more effective regime without the fear of falling that was once associated with rebound sports shoes.


Marking the rebound sport shoe category’s first innovative product launch since 1994, Air Glide Mario™ will enable us to change the lives of millions around the world with your support from this Indiegogo campaign. Air Glide Mario™ is patent pending and our goal is to raise $50,000. The funds will be used for additional prototypes to test out and fine tune resistance options for users of various weights, the initial molds for the 5 category classes of sizing, to support our patent filing with the EPO to help protect our product abroad, to meet minimum order quantity requirements of proposed US manufacturers, and to jump start our headquarters which will also serve as a fitness studio and store front to centralize and foster our air glide community as well as enable people to try our product before purchasing. The more funds that we can raise for this project, the faster that we will be able to get the opening model to market and start designing other models in our fleet.

>>BENEFITS OF REBOUND SPORT SHOES: STATS FOR MY SKEPTICS
Scientific studies indicate that rebound sports shoes will allow for the following:

Up to 68% more exercise efficiency; N.A.S.A. Journal of Applied Physiology 49(5): 881-88


Up to 80% reduced impact to knees, hips, and spine and prevents or reduces injuries; Vance, Mercer University of Nevada


Over 18% increase in VO2 Max; J.E. Taunton, FACSM, N.S. Miller, E.C. Rhodes, FACSM, B.D. Zumbo, S. Fraser





Up to 25% increased oxygen uptake and calorie burn; Gremion, University of Lausanne Switzerland CASS


Increased proprioception which minimizes recurrence of sports injuries to the joints as well as decrease falls; Vijay B. Vad, MD, Cornell Hospital for Special Surgery


Ideal conditioning and useful in the rehabilitation of both athletes and ""normal"" active people that are recovering from ""sports related"" injuries; Gremion, University of Lausanne Switzerland CASS


Greater cardiovascular improvement and fewer injuries; J.M. Buchanan School of Human Kinetics, University of British Columbia







>>HOW DO THEY WORK? *NERD ALERT* Please skip this section if you are not a science nerd!





The elliptical spring of rebound sport shoes delays the shock you experience when your foot hits the ground providing a soft comfortable run and a greater workout (up to 3 times) in less time than wearing traditional shoes. Muscles can’t be exercised by shock because they can’t act quickly enough to absorb all the kinetic energy of running and high impact exercise. Up to 75% of this kinectic energy is absorbed by our skeletal structure which leads to the gradual wearing out of bones, joints, and ligaments. When the spring is compressed the kinetic energy is absorbed, stored, and converted to potential return energy that can be utilized in a variety of ways that serves as a “kick back” either increasing the running speed, upward acceleration, or forward locomotion with less effort for the user.



When traditionally jumping, hopping, or leaping you biomechanically have to drop down into a hip and knee flexed position (squat) to initiate and continue jumping, hopping, or leaping. When Air Gliding you can isometrically contract stiffening your core and leg muscles from a 0 degree hip and knee flexed position (straight legs) to create your own kinetic energy that can propel you vertically and/or horizontally.



Based on science, biomechanics, and the laws of physics I have created the technical terminology “Air Gliding.” Air Gliding is a mobile version of rebounding not restricted to a stationary fixed position (trampoline) and is focused on the perspective of movement that happens in the air because the user is in the air more than they are touching the ground. In order to glide there needs to be an absence of friction which only happens while airborne in rebound sport shoes with the potential to Air Glide™ up to 10,000 times an hour.

>> HOW WILL IT HELP?




ARE YOU INJURED? Using rebound sport shoes is scientifically proven to reduce up to 80% of the impact to your joints and back. People with knee and hip replacements, bad knees, scoliosis, herniated discs, and many other injuries sensitive to impact have been able to run and exercise again at a high intensity. Plyo Air Glides™ will get almost all injured people running and exercising again due to the impact absorption of the shoe and eliminate the risk of damaging, aggravating, or re-injuring joints, muscles, and ligaments that are weakened by overuse or reconstructive surgery.




ARE YOU OVERWEIGHT OR OBESE? Using rebound sport shoes is scientifically proven to burn over 25% more calories, stimulates your lymphatic system flushing excess water weight and toxins, reduces cellulite, and increases your metabolic rate making you burn more calories at rest.  In addition you will feel light on your feet and the massive endorphin rush and lower perceived exertion will make you want to work out longer, harder, and more often with no pain to your joints.





ARE YOU SEDENTARY? A sedentary lifestyle is an excessive amount of daily sitting whether it be watching TV, working on a computer, or even reading. Sitting for an extended period of time makes your body start to shut down at the metabolic level, circulation is slowed, and fewer calories are burned as well as other negative health influences including increased anxiety, damaging your mind, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, depression and more. Plyo Air Glides™ are easy to use, fun, and the euphoric thrill will motivate anyone naturally off the couch combating all of those symptoms and will never make you want to sit.





ARE YOU A FITNESS ENTHUSIAST? Rebounding is an exercise that reduces your body fat; firms your arms, legs, thighs, abdomen, and hips; increases your agility; strengthens your muscles overall; provides an aerobic effect for your heart; rejuvenates your body when it's tired, and generally puts you in a state of health and fitness. People who rebound find they are able to work longer, sleep better, and feel less tense and nervous. The effect is not just psychological, because the action of bouncing up and down against gravity, without trauma to the musculoskeletal system, is one of the most beneficial aerobic exercises ever developed.  Plyo Air Glides™ is a concentrated and evolved form of rebounding enabling you to get maximum benefits in less time with a reduced chance of injury.



ARE YOU AN ATHLETE? In order to be your best you must train harder, faster, and frequently. Because of this you have a high percentage risk of overuse, recurring, and career ending injuries.  Rebound sport shoes are scientifically proven to reduce up to 80% of the impact shock to your ankles, shins, knees, hips, lower back, and spine, reduces injuries, and allows athletes to resume their workouts and training much sooner. In addition studies have found that it's 68% more efficient, you increase your VO2 Max by 18.3%, and 25% increased oxygen uptake and calorie burn. Rehabilitation time compromises muscle control and strength, endurance, proprioception, and balance. Plyo Air Glides™ keeps you in the game by preventing and reducing injuries and reduces your time on the sidelines by accelerated healing of sports relating injuries and limiting the risk of aggravating or damaging joints that are weakened by overuse or reconstructive surgery.






>> KNOWLEDGE IS POWER


Because of the knowledge and skill level I posses, I have become the most successful, visually known, and sought after rebound sport shoe trainer in the entire world. I can sprint up to speeds of 30 MPH, effortlessly jump over 7 feet high, and posses an uncanny sense of proprioception that allows me to fearlessly race cars, buses, and taxi's in the streets of NYC.



One of the big drawbacks of rebound sport shoes currently is that people use them without properly knowing how to utilize them and only do the basic running, jumping, and other easy exercises using only momentum that may look novel, monotonous, and bland. Using them is also counter-intuitive bio-mechanically and if you aren't using the proper technique, you will hurt yourself.





Using my 8 years of experience, knowledge, and skill based on an application of Newton's Third Law of action and reaction, I have created a specific training technique called SELF-PROPULSION TECHNIQUE™. SELF-PROPULSION TECHNIQUE™ teaches you the ""how"", ""why"" and ""how to apply"" this specific technique to give you complete control, precision, and advanced measurable results. Instead of solely relying on momentum it teaches you how to create, utilize, and maximize your own momentum and kinetic energy in rebound sport shoes.



Each product will come standard with an ""Air Gliding 101"" SELF-PROPULSION TECHNIQUE™ training DVD video to properly train consumers how to safely, efficiently, and effortlessly use Plyo Air Glides™.  We want users to fully understand how to utilize our product so that they look amazing while using it and are maximizing their benefits and results.



In addition we will use the following equipment based SELF PROPULSION TECHNIQUE™ fitness programs to further instill advanced level training spawning an elite level of athletes with potential to be Olympians.



PLYO TORCH™ A fat burning, aerobic, and athletic interval drill based format for beginners.  Easy to follow and no coordination is needed.


PLYO DANCE™ A fusion of dance, plyometrics, conditioning, and core, set to top 40 remixes that is more dance party than fitness class for all levels.







PLYO LATINO™ A fusion of latin dance, conditioning, and core work set to the hottest salsa, merengue, and other international beats.


PLYO AIR GLIDE™ A running technique based training format specifically to train competitive, serious, and leisurely runners as well as recreational joggers and running groups.







PLYO ATHLETE™ An intense, timed, and high intensity interval training based circuit style workout for intermediate and advanced level participants. You have the option of an indoor circuit or outdoor free for all.


PLYO COMBAT™ A fusion of martial arts, conditioning, core, and plyometrics.

PLYO BARRE™ A mind/body exercise format that is a fusion of pilates, conditioning, core work, and floor work.





PLYO KIDS™ A fitness format for kids and schools that is motivational, full of games, challenges children's creativity, develops coordination skills, endurance, good body posture, and improves self image. This format will help to combat the childhood obesity epidemic and rebounding has been shown to improve cognitive function in austistic children.






>> WHO I AM




""Mario Godiva is the big boss of bounce, the special agent of spring, and the hip meister of hop."" - ABC Nightline
“These rebound shoes arrived in New York City when trainer Mario Godiva moved here three years ago from Chicago with 20 pairs.”- NY Times
""Students in celeb trainer Mario Godiva’s Plyo Dance class range from the experienced to the brand-new, but participants strap on the shock-absorbing shoes in an almost cult-like fashion."" – NY Daily News







I’m Fitness Expert and CEO of Plyo Air LLC Mario Godiva and I’ve been active in the fitness industry for over 13 years. Early 2006 I discovered rebound sport shoes, sought out training, became certified, and became the first person to pioneer rebound sport shoe fitness classes in the US, Turkey, and Russia. No one took me seriously, everyone thought it was a gimmick, and everyone laughed at me. But for every person that told me “no” I would eventually find someone that would tell me “yes” and it ended up changing their life and inspiring them to exercise. Little did I know that for the next 8 years I would be traveling the world motivating, inspiring, and changing the lives of thousands of people.


I have been a rebound sport shoe dealer, personal trainer, instructor, master trainer training others how to use them, international presenter at fitness conventions, and an official spokesmodel for the rebound sport shoe concept for 8 years, been featured in over 100 international, national, & local TV, print, and media interviews as well as have over 300 of my own videos (many of them viral) on youtube, vimeo, etc, have been a rebound sport shoe prototype tester giving feedback and improvements for rebound sport shoes before they came out to market, and for 8 years have almost used rebound sport shoes daily in the field with thousands of people across the globe. Suffice to say I know a thing or two about rebound sport shoes. ;-)



The foundation for my success with rebound sport shoes is relying on 'guerilla marketing' tactics, grassroots activities, and social media.  I never had any budget to work with so I got creative and depended solely on aggressive, unorthodox, and inexpensive methods to get rebound sport shoes into the public eye.  I equated using rebound sport shoes with a fun, active, sexy, and trendy lifestyle. I sent rebound sport shoes to producers, celebs, athletes, and established many cross promotional tie-ins with various companies.  





Most importantly I always took rebound sport shoes out on the streets and gave many opportunities for people to see and try them. I would do outdoor Plyo Dance™ classes in parks, fairs, festivals, concerts, college campuses, and other outdoor events. Where ever I knew a lot of people would gather I would be there with my team.





>> THE IDEA & WHERE WE ARE AT


Despite my visual success and spearheading the rebound sport shoe movement across the globe, it still hasn't caught on with the majority of people. After noticing no real desire to further innovate the product in the category, I decided to take matters in my own hands and assembled a dream team that could not only design an innovative game changing product, but be able change the image and bring the science and information to the majority of people's eyes and ears.  Here is a breakdown of events:






December 2012 we brainstormed about our product, it's image, and targeted demographics.


We analyzed current products to see what was working and what needed to be improved and researched new fitness and footwear trends.


We decided that everything with our product including terminology should be technical, politically correct, and based on physics and biomechanics.






We knew rollerblades had a similar journey with challenges and we brainstormed and researched the evolution of rollerblades to gauge what type of product we could start with and what type of other models that we could create to make a fleet of innovative, advanced, and functionality driven products.







We created, analyzed, and went through a variety of sketches, functionalities, and finally settled upon a mid-range design that would be the opening model, Air Glide Mario™.









We wanted to patent it and it's advanced features. We questioned what our product could do that all the other current products couldn't do that would keep us ahead of the game as more and more people caught on to the concept.





We wanted the product's rebound spring to be removable and for the top boot to function as a walking shoe.  After testing many homemade prototype parts and features we settled upon the sliding and locking technique as the most stable and easy method.







We knew we had to take the common fear of falling head on and so we came up with the anti fall safety edge and tested a homemade prototype to make sure it would actually work.





We are in the prototype testing phase and testing the models out for functionality, safety, and quality. Resistance is a primary factor of the experience and many more prototypes are needed to test out on users with various weights and injuries to create a customize-able resistance guide. Part of the money we are raising is for additional prototypes to test every single demographic that we are targeting so that we can communicate exactly what type of resistance is needed due to age, injury, weight, etc. After consistent testing of the prototypes is completed we will engineer the final rendering and send to one of our manufacturers to produce.
Plyo Air Glides™ will be a world wide brand with international distribution and because of that we would like to file a patent with the European Patent Office (EPO). This is a lengthy multi-step process and part of the funds raised will assist us in being able to file and protect our product abroad.
We would like the production to happen in the US to help promote the US economy and prevent illegal copying of our innovative and advanced product. We have requested quotes from several plastic injection molding and product outsourcing companies across the country, and are confident that this business model will work. There are several plastic injection molding companies that are offering competitive prices to combat work being sent to China and we want to support them by having them create a high quality, premium, and US engineered product.
In order to make this happen and keep this work in the US we need the help of the Indiegogo community in order to cover costs and meet the minimum order requirements of our US manufacturing partners. If we meet our funding goal of $50,000 we will be properly capitalized (i.e. ""have enough money"") to officially start the production process of the opening model Air Glide Mario™ of Plyo Air Glides™.





 >> PLAN TO MARKET


We estimate that the first batch will be ready and available exclusively to supporters January 2014. At launch March 2014 the product will be available exclusively to Indiegogo supporters and via a very limited amount of select authorized dealers throughout the US and world who have contributed to our campaign. We feel comfortable targeting January 2014 for our first full-production shipments to supporters in the US, and February 2014 for our first International shipments. We have padded this schedule slightly in the event of any issues and hope to be able to provide them even sooner. Order processing and fulfillment will happen at our office and warehouse headquarters in New York, NY.
We will move forward with the following schedule:

Prototype Testing, Final design, and Engineering: --- est. completion October 2013. Our NYC based team and a select few others will test the stability, functionality, and comfort of the first batch of prototypes and collectively have a meeting and asses the results of continued use for at least 30 days.  Pending results of the meeting and collective feedback we will draft the final rendering to be sent to our manufacturer.

Ordering of injection moulding tooling: ---- complete November 2013


Production: ---- complete November/December 2014


Order/Pledge Fulfillment: --- US January 2014, International February 2014. Order and pledge fulfillment will happen from our office and warehouse headquarters in New York, NY.

</p><p>PulseOn was created after the realization of the mismatch between the enormous value of heart rate monitoring in various use cases from fitness to wellness and health, and on the other hand the lousy user experience that traditional heart rate monitors offer. The traditional chest belts are uncomfortable and actually offer only limited insight into your training
– for an average user the plain heart rate graphs and averages don't make much sense! The innovation for an accurate and reliable optical heart rate sensor to be worn on the wrist took place years ago within Nokia and resulted in a
spin-off in November 2012 when PulseOn was founded by our five key team members with
world-class expertise in all functional areas to be able to make their vision
of the world’s easiest heart rate monitoring reality. </p><p>Since then, our growing team of experts in sensor technology, physiology, algorithms and mobile technology have been
working hard to bring our innovation to market which is now only inches away! PulseOn has been designed and developed in Finland where our team of 13 people are now beyond excited to finally see the vision become reality.<br/> </p><h2>What makes us unique?</h2><p>PulseOn has created a proprietary sensor solution using multiple 
wavelenghts of light combined with a unique sensor design to measure 
your blood flow from different depths of skin tissue. This makes PulseOn
 able to measure heart rate accurately and reliably in a wide variety of
 conditions and use cases. Together with intelligent algorithms and 
patented mechanical design allowing for the device to fit your wrist 
flawlessly and comfortably, PulseOn can monitor your heart rate 
accurately even at highest running speeds and across multiple 
cardio-intensive sports. Its accuracy is comparable to chest strap based
 monitors while its comfort is equal to a wrist band! For the first 
time, you can truly replace your chest belt. <br/></p>

Our technology is able to determine your heart rate very accurately by dynamically measuring with different lights, position, powers and depths of your skin to always find an optimal signal. The issue with earlier optical technologies has been firstly their vulnerability to movement and limited operative ranges, thus limiting the use cases either to only resting heart rate or to monitoring only in very stable movement when your skin is warm. PulseOn has been able to overcome both these issues with our sensor technology and intelligent algorithms, for the first time bringing continuous heart rate monitoring with chest belt accuracy to sporting events in a wide range of sports and conditions. But what's more, for the first time we can accurately offer continuous heart rate monitoring also outside sporting events, even up to beat-to-beat accuracy. </p><h3>What does it mean to have continuous heart rate monitoring like PulseOn?<br/>
</h3><p>It is key to PulseOn to be able to monitor heart rate continuously as this is the only way to be able to lock into meaningful analytics on a person's heart rate behavior. With continuous heart rate data we are able to determine the full effect of training and truly tell you what your heart rate means. Up until now, it has only been possible to get accurate continuous heart rate data during your training with uncomfortable chest belts which have been only limited to this use case. With PulseOn, for the first time you can get very accurate and reliable heart rate data in a wide range of sports in various conditions and can also continue monitoring your heart rate after your training event. And all with an incredible stylish device!<br/></p><p>There are a few devices in the market offering instantaneous heart rate, meaning features allowing you to check your heart rate at certain moments during your day. As the heart rate information is only limited to these certain specific moments, they are not able to give you insight into what does your heart rate mean, thus only being able to give you a crude number. <br/></p><p>With continuous heart rate we can unlock incredible valuable information on how your body responds to different events and can offer a view into longer term development of your fitness. In addition, being able to accurate and reliably determine your heart rate already during training both in numeric terms but also seeing the accumulating effect of specific training sessions as you train, we can also help you optimize how you are training towards your fitness goals. </p><h3>Will I get my PulseOn if the funding goal for the campaign is not reached?</h3><p>Yes! We will deliver all the devices ordered during the preorder campaign period by September 2014. We have the production capacity, slots and components already ordered and ready to go but need your help is showing the potential for the fantastic device we have built with our heart and soul.  <br/></p><h3>Is PulseOn waterproof?</h3><p>Yes! PulseOn is waterproof until 1 meter and thus it is safe to shower with it and use it even in sports with splashing water. </p><h3>Will I be able to use PulseOn with my favorite sports app?</h3><p>Yes! We will be offering an open API that can transmit the accurate heart rate data we gather through a Bluetooth profile to third party apps and devices. </p><h3>Is there a geographical limitation to where I can use the device?</h3><p>No! We ship the devices globally and our devices can be taken into use anywhere as the charging clip is not specific to a certain socket but can be attached into any USB port. </p><h3>What is the strap of PulseOn made of?</h3><p>The strap has been designed for the best comfort and fit available. It is made of elastic technical material that is resistant to dirt, water and sweat and is also washable. The straps are changeable too, offered both in two different lengths for a nice fit for the smallest to largest wrists (from 16 cm to 25 cm wrist circumference) and also in different colors for you to personalize your PulseOn to your favorite style!<br/></p><h3>What is the battery life of PulseOn?</h3><p>The minimum battery life with one charging (one hour from empty to full with a USB charging clip) will be three full days. This includes one hour of use in sports mode everyday and 24/7 usage in standard mode cumulatively. The battery life is still being optimized and we are working hard to optimize each aspect of usage for you!</p><h3>Do I need to have a phone with me I'm training?</h3><p>No! One of the many benefits of PulseOn is that it works independently, storing all your training data onto the device memory and automatically syncs the details into the application when's you are close to your mobile device the next time. Thus there's no obligatory carrying your phone with you - now that's freedom!<br/></p><h3>Why should I preorder?</h3><p>First of all, you will be receiving your product first before it is being delivered to anywhere else. Secondly, you will be ensuring that our dream becomes reality showing your support for PulseOn. Thirdly, this will be your chance to get your PulseOn with a great discount up to over 50 % (recommended retail price will be $199/199€/£179). Last but not least, you will be a part of making the world's easiest heart rate monitoring reality!<br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>

– We make heart rate monitoring easier than ever!
PulseOn is a wrist based optical heart rate monitor which brings you a
combination of comfort and ease-of-use like you’ve never seen before, to
make heart rate monitoring easier than ever. Our small and stylish wrist device
measures your heart rate accurately and reliably from your wrist, without the
need for a chest belt, allowing you to get the most out of your training.
Combined with meaningful insights during and after training, it truly is the
world’s easiest heart rate monitoring device, allowing you to optimize your
training and maximize the effect. PulseOn’s proprietary optical heart rate sensor technology is based on our innovation for multiwavelenght measurement. Combined
with our highly sophisticated algorithms to extract and analyze heart rate in a wide range of conditions, PulseOn monitors your heart rate
continuously during your training events but also beyond. With
wireless connectivity to mobile applications, we transform the heart rate data into meaningful feedback
on your training, making it truly
personalized. PulseOn tells you what your heart rate really means. PulseOn story
PulseOn was created after the realization of the mismatch between the enormous value of heart rate monitoring in various use cases from fitness to wellness and health, and on the other hand the lousy user experience that traditional heart rate monitors offer. The traditional chest belts are uncomfortable and actually offer only limited insight into your training
– for an average user the plain heart rate graphs and averages don't make much sense! The innovation for an accurate and reliable optical heart rate sensor to be worn on the wrist took place years ago within Nokia and resulted in a
spin-off in November 2012 when PulseOn was founded by our five key team members with
world-class expertise in all functional areas to be able to make their vision
of the world’s easiest heart rate monitoring reality. Since then, our growing team of experts in sensor technology, physiology, algorithms and mobile technology have been
working hard to bring our innovation to market which is now only inches away! PulseOn has been designed and developed in Finland where our team of 13 people are now beyond excited to finally see the vision become reality. What makes us unique?PulseOn has created a proprietary sensor solution using multiple 
wavelenghts of light combined with a unique sensor design to measure 
your blood flow from different depths of skin tissue. This makes PulseOn
 able to measure heart rate accurately and reliably in a wide variety of
 conditions and use cases. Together with intelligent algorithms and 
patented mechanical design allowing for the device to fit your wrist 
flawlessly and comfortably, PulseOn can monitor your heart rate 
accurately even at highest running speeds and across multiple 
cardio-intensive sports. Its accuracy is comparable to chest strap based
 monitors while its comfort is equal to a wrist band! For the first 
time, you can truly replace your chest belt. 
No need for a chest strap 
PulseOn brings you the ultimate comfort and style in heart rate monitoring, with accurate and reliable continuous heart rate monitoring during your training events but also beyond!Meaningful insights
We transform the accurate heart rate data into meaningful feedback on your training to allow you to understand the effect of training on your body and optimize your training. We tell you what your heart rate means and transform the information into easily actionable feedback, whether you are an athlete or a beginner. We'll also be there to coach you towards your next fitness level. Small and stylish designNo more bulky devices! PulseOn is stylish and comfortable with perfected dimensions weighing less than 30 grams (~1 ounce). Its ultra-comfortable strap allows PulseOn to find an optimal fit no matter what size or shape your wrist is, and allows your skin to breathe without getting irritated even in continuous use. It truly is the most stylish device out there! Wireless connectivityAutomatic syncing with apps on iOS and Android via Bluetooth offering you easily accessible feedback. If you wish, you can also sync the accurate heart rate data from your PulseOn wrist device with your favorite apps with our open API profile.  PulseOn features
PulseOn heart rate wrist band is not only small and
unbelievably stylish but also incredibly simple to use, providing you with important information during your
training. In Sports mode, you can track during your training event and understand what
is the effect of the session on your fitness in real-time, as it accumulates. In
addition, your PulseOn shows you other informative details of your on-going
workout.  After your training event, you
can check your heart rate at any time on your wrist device and also wear it as
a watch in the standard mode.The design of PulseOn has been a core focus in our development also to overcome the bulky and technical feel of heart rate monitoring devices. Instead we've gone for the sleek, sexy and stylish design that has also been awarded with the Design From Finland trademark! Due to its lightweight design and elegant materials, it is also highly comfortable to wear both on and off training events. 
After your training event, your PulseOn will
automatically sync the details of the session with your iOS or Android mobile application, offering
you full details about the event. Our application is designed specifically to
provide you with meaningful information on the training session and your
fitness, rather than merely showing heart rate graphs and curves. We transform
the accurate continuous heart rate data gathered by your PulseOn device into
easily understandable and actionable information on the effect of specific
training sessions all the way to coaching you towards your next fitness level.
You can go deeper into the details on specific training sessions or check your
training history and summaries of your training sessions on monthly, weekly and
even yearly basis. What's more, all the information is truly individual and specific to your own fitness level which we automatically determine based on our in-built fitness test automatically estimating your VO2max (i.e. maximal oxygen consumption, the golden standard for fitness level). With PulseOn you can truly see the effect of training on your fitness and how it develops over time. You can get a deeper view into the key analytics provided by PulseOn on our website. PulseOn is offered in two stylish variants, beautiful Cloud and 
dramatic
Coal. With easily changeable straps, available in our 
webstore upon first PulseOn deliveries, you can also personalize your device
with additional colors. First additional colors available are the energetic Acid and 
modern Midnight
with the introduction of new seasonal colors based on your feedback. The
 straps also come in two
different sizes, for smaller and larger wrists with both sizes included 
in your
PulseOn device package to find the perfect fit for you. Technology

Your blood flows everywhere in your body.
When you are feeling hot the blood flows on very surface of your skin while in
colder conditions your blood flows in deeper layers.  PulseOn is based on our patented optical sensor includes different wavelenghts of light which
illuminate your skin in different depths and a photodetector to detect the
tiny modulations of light intensity caused by pulsatile flow of blood in the
tissue. With our unique sensor design and algorithms, we can dynamically always select the optimal signal in different depths of skin to get your heart rate reliably in a wide range of conditions. This is at the heart of PulseOn's innovation!Our intelligent algorithms reject disturbances caused by movements and detect the tiny modulations caused by blood flow to optimize
the measurement depth dynamically to best detect your heart rate in different conditions.
The technology is validated to perform as accurately as traditional chest strap based heart rate monitors in various sports, from
walking to running and cycling, in different conditions and speeds up to highest performance levels. In
addition, you can also continuously monitor your heart rate outside your
training events. You can find more detailed technical information on our website. 
PulseOn will not only bring you the most comfort and style for continuous heart rate monitoring during your training sessions but also beyond!Accuracy and performanceWe apply the strictest scientific
standards to our measurement technology's accuracy and reliability. From the
start, we set a goal to ourselves to be able to offer leading edge accuracy and
reliability with our sensor technology, meeting chest belt level performance
during various sports but also offering the most reliable results outside
training events, even up to beat-to-beat accuracy during rest. 
PulseOn's performance has been tested in various
cardio-intensive sports, from biking to walking to running etc, from lower
intensities to the highest performance speeds. The performance has been
validated against ECG which is the golden standard for heart rate monitoring in
medical use. This all is done so that you can truly replace your chest belt
with full confidence!Below, you can see some reference measurements from our tests against medical level ECG with PulseOn's performance correlating with incredible accuracy across different activities. PulseOn in media

PulseOn has developed the most sophisticated measurement algorithms with CSEM to be able to extract the best signal quality and precision with our leading optical heart rate sensing technology. 
Become a part of the PulseOn tribe!We need your help to get our final push to the market. Our device and application are both in the final stages of product development, and are currently going through beta testing. It has taken us multiple device builds, endless software releases and rigorous tuning to get to where we are now. PulseOn is getting rave reviews from our testers and is ready to be presented to you this September! To make our dream reality, we need your support to take us to mass production. In this campaign, we are seeking for USD 150.000 to help us start the serial production of our product and ask you to show your support to get our device from the R&D desk to reality! By contributing to our campaign, you will be receiving your own PulseOn device from the first mass production batch this September before its full availability, and be able to be proudly listed as a part of our PulseOn Tribe on our website. We will be delivering the devices in September even if the full funding amount is not reached. We will keep you continually updated on the progress on our social channels and encourage you to give us feedback as we make our PulseOn even better. We are committed to making heart rate monitoring easier than ever and you are at the core of this promise. We would love to heart from you either on our social channels or in our mailbox info@pulseon.com. Please help us spread the news on the world's easiest heart rate monitoring and share the excitement! FAQHere we are answering the questions we have received from you and please keep them coming to us at info@pulseon.com if you should have anything you want to run by us!How is PulseOn's heart rate performance compared to traditional heart rate chest straps and to some earlier optical technologies in the market currently?PulseOn's core is the incredibly accurate and reliable sensor technology which is different to what is currently out in the market. Our technology is able to determine your heart rate very accurately by dynamically measuring with different lights, position, powers and depths of your skin to always find an optimal signal. The issue with earlier optical technologies has been firstly their vulnerability to movement and limited operative ranges, thus limiting the use cases either to only resting heart rate or to monitoring only in very stable movement when your skin is warm. PulseOn has been able to overcome both these issues with our sensor technology and intelligent algorithms, for the first time bringing continuous heart rate monitoring with chest belt accuracy to sporting events in a wide range of sports and conditions. But what's more, for the first time we can accurately offer continuous heart rate monitoring also outside sporting events, even up to beat-to-beat accuracy. What does it mean to have continuous heart rate monitoring like PulseOn?
It is key to PulseOn to be able to monitor heart rate continuously as this is the only way to be able to lock into meaningful analytics on a person's heart rate behavior. With continuous heart rate data we are able to determine the full effect of training and truly tell you what your heart rate means. Up until now, it has only been possible to get accurate continuous heart rate data during your training with uncomfortable chest belts which have been only limited to this use case. With PulseOn, for the first time you can get very accurate and reliable heart rate data in a wide range of sports in various conditions and can also continue monitoring your heart rate after your training event. And all with an incredible stylish device!There are a few devices in the market offering instantaneous heart rate, meaning features allowing you to check your heart rate at certain moments during your day. As the heart rate information is only limited to these certain specific moments, they are not able to give you insight into what does your heart rate mean, thus only being able to give you a crude number. With continuous heart rate we can unlock incredible valuable information on how your body responds to different events and can offer a view into longer term development of your fitness. In addition, being able to accurate and reliably determine your heart rate already during training both in numeric terms but also seeing the accumulating effect of specific training sessions as you train, we can also help you optimize how you are training towards your fitness goals. Will I get my PulseOn if the funding goal for the campaign is not reached?Yes! We will deliver all the devices ordered during the preorder campaign period by September 2014. We have the production capacity, slots and components already ordered and ready to go but need your help is showing the potential for the fantastic device we have built with our heart and soul.  Is PulseOn waterproof?Yes! PulseOn is waterproof until 1 meter and thus it is safe to shower with it and use it even in sports with splashing water. Will I be able to use PulseOn with my favorite sports app?Yes! We will be offering an open API that can transmit the accurate heart rate data we gather through a Bluetooth profile to third party apps and devices. Is there a geographical limitation to where I can use the device?No! We ship the devices globally and our devices can be taken into use anywhere as the charging clip is not specific to a certain socket but can be attached into any USB port. What is the strap of PulseOn made of?The strap has been designed for the best comfort and fit available. It is made of elastic technical material that is resistant to dirt, water and sweat and is also washable. The straps are changeable too, offered both in two different lengths for a nice fit for the smallest to largest wrists (from 16 cm to 25 cm wrist circumference) and also in different colors for you to personalize your PulseOn to your favorite style!What is the battery life of PulseOn?The minimum battery life with one charging (one hour from empty to full with a USB charging clip) will be three full days. This includes one hour of use in sports mode everyday and 24/7 usage in standard mode cumulatively. The battery life is still being optimized and we are working hard to optimize each aspect of usage for you!Do I need to have a phone with me I'm training?No! One of the many benefits of PulseOn is that it works independently, storing all your training data onto the device memory and automatically syncs the details into the application when's you are close to your mobile device the next time. Thus there's no obligatory carrying your phone with you - now that's freedom!Why should I preorder?First of all, you will be receiving your product first before it is being delivered to anywhere else. Secondly, you will be ensuring that our dream becomes reality showing your support for PulseOn. Thirdly, this will be your chance to get your PulseOn with a great discount up to over 50 % (recommended retail price will be $199/199€/£179). Last but not least, you will be a part of making the world's easiest heart rate monitoring reality!",24.0,1,"1 Campaign

He took these heart attacks as a sign to change his life for the better; not just for himself but for his children and wife. With a history of two heart attacks, and cholesterol levels over 700, his cardiologist said he would be on several medications the rest of his life. During Larry’s career, as a nurse, he has seen a lot of patients on pharmaceutical medications that did not get better. He decided to take a different route; a holistic approach to improve his health. To regain his energy and health, he began running, switched to an organic vegan diet and started using his own blend of herbs to stay healthy. He reversed heart disease, substantially lowered his cholesterol levels to a healthy range and now enjoys an abundance of energy. He does not take any medications. He regularly hikes, plays tennis, uses a kettle-bell and runs every day. He shares his herbs with family and friends. Because of the noticeable and amazing turn around in his health, he often receives requests for his herbal blends from others. He realized he could help more people if he took his herbs to another level. Because these herbs have helped him, and his loved ones, improve the quality of their lives, he wants to share them with you.<br/><br/>Here is Larry’s testimonial on why he chose herbs instead of medication:<br/><br/>“Having been a nurse for 30 years, I have taken care of a lot of patients. They came from a variety of backgrounds but all had one thing in common, they took a lot of medications. Most of them thought the cure was another pill; the one that would make them feel better. The way to feel better is not another pill. It is found in improved health and proper nourishment. Medications treat symptoms. They are not designed for any thing else. People are entering nursing homes at younger and younger ages. One patient I took care of was in his early 50’s. He was diabetic, which contributed to high blood pressure and high cholesterol. He was put on a medication to lower cholesterol. The side<br/>effects of this prescription caused depression. A month later he was put on a long term anti-depressant.

Based on feedback on our incredibly successful OYO Personal Gym (2nd highest funded fitness product in Kickstarter history), we've created this new heavy duty, higher resistance, portable gym that provides total body strength training, at home, office, or on the go. The NOVA Gym provides up to 40lbs (18kg) of resistance in each hand in all planes of movement, yet only weights 2.5lbs (1.12Kg) and  folds up to go anywhere. 
 
    OYO Fitness founder Paul Francis invented the first resistive exercise device for space, the NASA iRED, incorporating his patented SpiraFlex technology. Before launch, NASA funded a 16 week study comparing SpiraFlex to free-weights. The study found that the SpiraFlex group had the same improvements in strength and muscular growth (hypertrophy) as the free-weight group. For 10 years over 50 crew members on the International Space Station have kept in shape using our SpiraFlex technology.   The OYO Nova Gym uses SpiraFlex resistance, which feels smooth and linear like free-weights, without the weight or momentum.   You asked for more resistance - we’ve delivered with 60% more than our original OYO Personal Gym. SpiraFlex FlexPacks, rated at 10lbs (4.5kg) each, snap on to provide up to 40lbs (18kg)of total resistance in each hand, yet the entire unit only weighs 2.5lbs (1.1kg) and folds up to fit in your bag or carry-on.   Nylon-coated stainless steel cables designed to be durable under high resistance loads.  T-Handle grips with steel inserts provide greater extension than the OYO Personal Gym and are over-molded with “Good Grip” material to handle the higher resistance levels.  


 


The Nova Gym is the only fitness device that provides abduction and adduction during a single exercise movement, building a balanced in less time. Also, as it does not require the vertical of gravity, you can perform exercises in all planes of movement, without extra equipment like a bench.   
 
 Skip the health club round-trips and fees. You can duplicate the same exercises and results — where you are right now!  What makes the NOVA Gym better than cable machines, free-weights, or resistance bands?Plate loaded cable machines take up a huge footprint in your home, or you have to go to the health club to use them. Free-weights work great, but can take up a lot of space and are heavy and cumbersome, and trying to control momentum can lead to joint issues. Resistance bands produce progressive resistance (like rubber bands) and are limited in movements. 

 
 
Build and sculpt your chest, back, arms, core and legs.Fitness Director Nick Bolton has developed over a 100 exercise and 50 workout videos, so you'll never get bored. Here's the Top 10 Exercises for all muscle groups:     Exercises are available on OYOfitness.com and the OYO Fitness YouTube channel. Download from OYO Fitness Vimeo channel.

<h3><span>Who We Are:</span></h3>
<p><span>Jessica Kotnour:I am a high school student from the lovely land of Central Florida and have lived with OCD throughout my middle and high school careers.  After working through and beating my OCD, I began to turn my focus on how I can help others going through the same thing.  I can't wait to start working with kids with OCD in a professional setting, but I realize that I don't have to wait in order until I'm older to help others. I started this project in May, but it really didn't take off until I met Katie who agreed to come on board and make this dream a reality.  It is so remarkable to see something that I've only thought about becoming concrete. </span></p>
<p><span>Katie Strang: I’m an Honor Roll student at Hobart and William Smith colleges. I have a job in the Dean’s office at school, as well as a part time job at a retirement facility when I’m at home. I’ve volunteered with kids for a long time, coaching middle-schoolers for a science competition for seven years, leading a Sunday school class for two years, and assistant teaching at a dance studio. The next step for me is being open about my own struggles and doing something to help others. When I met Jessica at the IOCDF conference this July (where we both spoke on panels) and she shared this idea with me, I knew I had to get on board. The last couple weeks of getting things rolling have been exhilarating, and I can’t wait to see where we will take this with your support!</span></p>
<p><span>Alyse Schacter: I am a Pre-Med Student at the University of Ottawa in the cold and beautiful city of Ottawa in Canada! I am working towards my dream of becoming a pediatrician and that goal keeps me going! In high school I had the opportunity to organize city-wide leadership camps and I had always wanted to have a chance to be involved in organizing camps again so this is really a dream come true! Working with kids has always been one of the greatest joys in my life- whether it is volunteering at a school, daycare or camp. When I met Katie and Jess and heard about Camp Audeamus at the recent International Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Foundation Conference, I could not wait to get on board.  Growing up I was blessed to go to overnight camp every summer even when my OCD was very severe. It was thanks to my amazing family, the camp staff and my incredible group of camp 'sisters' that I was able to attend even when I was facing a lot of challenges. The memories I made at camp still bring me so much joy and I am beyond excited to make that possible for other kids. I believe that through providing love, strong, support, and a fun environment, we can make each camper's experience special and unforgettable.</span></p>

APOP is the online organization I founded in April, 2015 whose mission is to encourage, support and inspire others to live healthy lifestyles, obtain happiness and achieve personal and fitness goals via three methods: Art, Fitness &amp; Blogging. Traditionally trained in Fine Arts and non-traditionally trained in wellness, I have developed a business that allows individuals of all backgrounds and walks of life to come together and make the world a better place, one person at a time. Through my practice as a fine artist and fitness nerd I have learned that improving the world is about revitalization of the mind and body. Whether I am using art as a form of moving meditation to revitalize my positive state of mind or fitness to transform my body into one that can live life to it’s fullest, I am completing my mission of improving the world one mind and body at a time.</span></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448523169/j49limoiyicocrhvlq6k.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>Developing deeper and stronger relationships with APOP’s surrounding communities by hosting art and fitness classes is a primary goal of this fundraising campaign. As of yet,  APOP has begun developing relationships with the online community by producing inspirational and motivational blog content including: Fitness Nerd Vlogs, #APOPFNF profiles a.k.a. success stories and Workout Wednesdays and Rest Day Recipes (APOP’s call to action content). In addition, I launched a membership drive in October 2015 to begin developing more interpersonal relationships between APOP and the wellness community, but a membership drive is just the beginning. There are many more opportunities of which APOP would like to take advantage and today I hope to take another step in that direction by offering members more such as access to not only myself as wellness success story, but also as a certified personal trainer (and eventually certified wellness coach) who is on call to answer any question a member might have about one’s mental or physical health journey. In addition to financing my personal training certification-- a prerequisite for my wellness coaching certification-- the funds raised will also give APOP a home to invite it's surrounding community in for classes on art as a meditative practice and personal training.  Having a newly branded and inspiring home for APOP will not only allow me the opportunity to entertain all of APOP’s virtual friends, colleagues and followers in a higher quality, improved capacity via online content, but will also allow me more opportunities to begin developing more interpersonal relationships through hosting classes that focus on mindfulness &amp; art as well as physical health and fitness.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449953719/ry2wnwgqeb8w7dj7yecs.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Still from APOP's YouTube Channel, ""FitnessNerdVlogs""<br/><h1>What APOP Needs</h1><p><b>KEY DESIGNATIONS: </b>Peronal Training Certification, Website Upgrade, Equipment, Space</p><br/><h4><i>All money raised for APOP and it's services, will be allocated to each item below:</i></h4><p><br/></p><p><b>$250 -Miscellaneous Registration Costs for Official Business Start-up</b></p><p><b>$600 -ACE Standard Personal Training Certification</b></p><ul>

<br/><br/><h1>The Impact</h1>
<h4>Perfect Yourself, Perfect the World -- that’s our motto!</h4>
<p>By making your gift you will help APOP perfect itself, so that it can in turn help others achieve self-betterment. As the founder, I personally like the word ‘perfect’ because it’s unachievable, thus forcing the users of the word to live in the mindset that once you achieve something there is always more to be done --more goals to work toward.</p>
<p>As the founder, I began my journey to self-improvement or ‘perfection,’ if you will, with this goal in mind when I created the YouTube Channel, FitnessNerdVlogs. Now that I am well into my own journey, I want to help others achieve their own goals and dreams. By expanding my dream from a simple YouTube Channel to a fully-functioning blog filled with daily content and, now, to an online and in-person business, I am taking the first steps in making my dreams of helping others discover their best selves come true. I do, however need a little bit more than just ideas and determination to improve the world; I need like-minded individuals like you to stand up and help me make a difference by giving a gift today.</p>

<br/><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I realize not all of us, myself included, are made of money, so if you don’t see yourself making a gift, that’s totally fine! I’d be flattered if you simply did one thing:</p>

Through my practice as a fine artist and fitness nerd I have learned that improving the world is about revitalization of the mind and body. Whether I am using art as a form of moving meditation to revitalize my positive state of mind or fitness to transform my body into one that can live life to it’s fullest, I am completing my mission of improving the world one mind and body at a time.Developing deeper and stronger relationships with APOP’s surrounding communities by hosting art and fitness classes is a primary goal of this fundraising campaign. As of yet,  APOP has begun developing relationships with the online community by producing inspirational and motivational blog content including: Fitness Nerd Vlogs, #APOPFNF profiles a.k.a. success stories and Workout Wednesdays and Rest Day Recipes (APOP’s call to action content). In addition, I launched a membership drive in October 2015 to begin developing more interpersonal relationships between APOP and the wellness community, but a membership drive is just the beginning. There are many more opportunities of which APOP would like to take advantage and today I hope to take another step in that direction by offering members more such as access to not only myself as wellness success story, but also as a certified personal trainer (and eventually certified wellness coach) who is on call to answer any question a member might have about one’s mental or physical health journey. In addition to financing my personal training certification-- a prerequisite for my wellness coaching certification-- the funds raised will also give APOP a home to invite it's surrounding community in for classes on art as a meditative practice and personal training.  Having a newly branded and inspiring home for APOP will not only allow me the opportunity to entertain all of APOP’s virtual friends, colleagues and followers in a higher quality, improved capacity via online content, but will also allow me more opportunities to begin developing more interpersonal relationships through hosting classes that focus on mindfulness & art as well as physical health and fitness.Still from APOP's YouTube Channel, ""FitnessNerdVlogs""What APOP NeedsKEY DESIGNATIONS: Peronal Training Certification, Website Upgrade, Equipment, SpaceAll money raised for APOP and it's services, will be allocated to each item below:$250 -Miscellaneous Registration Costs for Official Business Start-up$600 -ACE Standard Personal Training Certification

The Impact
Perfect Yourself, Perfect the World -- that’s our motto!
By making your gift you will help APOP perfect itself, so that it can in turn help others achieve self-betterment. As the founder, I personally like the word ‘perfect’ because it’s unachievable, thus forcing the users of the word to live in the mindset that once you achieve something there is always more to be done --more goals to work toward.
As the founder, I began my journey to self-improvement or ‘perfection,’ if you will, with this goal in mind when I created the YouTube Channel, FitnessNerdVlogs. Now that I am well into my own journey, I want to help others achieve their own goals and dreams. By expanding my dream from a simple YouTube Channel to a fully-functioning blog filled with daily content and, now, to an online and in-person business, I am taking the first steps in making my dreams of helping others discover their best selves come true. I do, however need a little bit more than just ideas and determination to improve the world; I need like-minded individuals like you to stand up and help me make a difference by giving a gift today.




Other Ways You Can Help
I realize not all of us, myself included, are made of money, so if you don’t see yourself making a gift, that’s totally fine! I’d be flattered if you simply did one thing:
Get the word out and make some noise about APOP’s campaign. Indiegogo makes sharing super easy with it’s build in share tools, so go on and spread the positivity one piece at a time!
And don't forget like us on Facebook! www.facebook.com/apopfitness

I also realize some of you are business professionals who may be interested in another type of gift: Sponsorship. I’d love for APOP to partner with organizations that’s mission aligns with my own; if you are interested in sponsoring some of APOP’s online content and receiving additional publicity in return contact me directly at: carleemyers@apopfitness.com.

Thanks for reading and remember… “Perfect Yourself, Perfect the World!”

Sincerely,

Carlee Myers

<p>Camp MARC has been of service to the mentally and physically disabled of Kentucky, Tennessee, Indiana, and beyond for over 50 years. The concept for Camp MARC began with a few pioneering parents who wanted to offer their mentally and physically disabled children an opportunity to experience summer camp like other children. Thus, Camp MARC was formed. </p>
<p>In the beginning camp was two weeks every summer but as time went on, and expenses rose, camp had to be cut to one week.

<p>On average, Camp MARC serves about one hundred campers a year from Western Kentucky.  While there, campers participate in music, nature, sports, arts &amp; crafts, swimming and boating.  They also have the opportunity to be part of such activities as a Cabaret, Camp Olympics, an Award Ceremony and a Dance.</p>
<p>*Camp MARC was founded in 1962 as a non-profit 501(c)3 orginazation and is staffed by a team of 14 Core Staff and 50 volunteer counselors*</p>

<p>HI- my name is Brian Layne, founder and CEO
of DNA Life Bars.   I created these whole food protein bars after my wife Elizabeth
was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis in 2010. 
With this life change, she took the non-traditional approach to her
well- being and choose an alternative method of healing that excluded medication and included whole food eating with no gluten, diary or sugar.  </p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Being an active couple  all our  lives, we could not find a protein bar that Elizabeth could eat after a workout, a
hike, or just for a snack.  I have always been the cook  in the family and thus began
experimenting with different ingredients until I created a protein bar that met
her high dietary standard, and tasted amazing. 
Elizabeth loved them so much and felt great eating them that she knew the bars had to be shared with the world!   </span></p>

What We Need & What You GetDNA Life Bars is at a critical point to take the business to the next level.  We are seeking your generous support of $15k  for pre-printed roll packaging that will allow us to transition from a commercial kitchen to a certified gluten-free co-packer. Currently we manually prep each package with three labels- which is very labor intensive and time consuming!  With your help we will be able to purchase  pre-printed packaging  for each flavor.   And lastly, make the move from our three man baking operation in a rented commercial kitchen to a local co-packer partnership which will allow us to focus our time and energy to creating new flavors, on-line marketing strategies and be able to fulfill larger orders to mainstream retail stores. The ImpactDNA Life Bars are the only protein bar on the market that is fresh BAKED and that not only taste amazing, but are made to support gut health.
