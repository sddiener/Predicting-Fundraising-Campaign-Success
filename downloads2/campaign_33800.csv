<p> Here I´m just passing the hat- free hugs and love in exchange!!!</p>
<p><br/>I strongly believe (because of how live has treated me) that things happen in your life when they have a reason to be, that you meet the ""right"" people when you have to meet them, I know that life will give us what we need when we really need it, when it´s the right time for you to get it, not before nor after! We just gotta be patient and go for whatever we wish in life to be happpy!</p>
<p>I´m an actor/dancer a life lover, a performer, a son, a brother, an uncle, a friend, a human! I come from a humble family from down Central América, from Costa Rica to be specific, I´ve studied mainly drama and dance for about four years back home, always having the ""weight"" on my shoulders of knowing that since I´m not from a wealthy family, this career is not for me as they say and as you can clearly see! But then I said to my self:</p>
<p>-you know what? fuck that!-</p>
<p>If this is what I love doing in my life I´ll simply go for it, no matter what the circumstances are or how challenging it will be, I don´t care, or I´d say: I do care, I care about having a challenge while pursuing what I want for my life, at the end of the day all what you can get out of any challenge is nothing but tons of learning and positive experience for life!</p>
<p>So I did get into Arts school, for some reason once I got there I always felt like I was not having what I wanted, what I needed, to be at a good physical and intelectual level to perform in many diferent ways, to be a well qualified performer because of his skills and his good school education;</p>
<p>besides that I´d always see friends and colleagues including myself, sort of ""adorating"" most of the artists who come to perform in Costa Rica, performers who come from North América or Europe to do a show and then everybody is talking about how great there are, but that´s all they do, it seems like they don´t think:</p>
<p>-we can be as dedicated as they are, do a great job as good as they do on scene, it´s not that their bodies or brains are more capable than ours, we all are humans with same of posibilities to learn and evolve physically, mentally and spiritually. BUt any way, I didn´t find it over there...</p>
<p>So I had a strong feeling after one year I started school, I promised to myself that I was going to study abroad, that I was going to be a great performer and that I´d go back home one day, full of experiences to share, to guide in learning processes in one of those arts schools maybe, and try to make a difference for better!</p>
<p>So here I am, it´s been almost a year and a half since I left home, I went to the US for a few months, then to Canada for a year, always looking for schools, oppotunities, where to study as a ""foreigner"" (not easy this absurd thing of being a ""FOREIGNER"" while being in the same planet), and working to survive and try to save up some money for school while doing the big research:</p>
<p>Where to study? where to settle down? where to be accepted? despite the fact that we all are human beings we still need to do tests and interviews to be accepted because ""WE DON´T BELONG"" to that place on earth! Humm, there´s something what doesn´t match in my head...</p>
<p>but, any ways...</p>
<p>after so many places that I´ve been through, people, adventures, ups and downs, emotional encounters, traveling, living, couchsurfing and so many other experiences...</p>
<p>Finally I found a school in Madrid, Spain!</p>
<p>where they don´t do extra charges for being a ""foreigner"" for instance; where I´m able to apply for a scholarship for the tuition of the school as much as national students (as they call them).</p>
<p>What I haven´t been able to do while traveling is to save up enough money to afford the cost of the living for at least the first year (in order to get a student visa I have to prove to the Spanish goverment that I have all the money I need to pay for my living cost for all the time what I´m asking the visa for! I don´t have it all, it´s a 4 year program- but there most be something I can do about it once I´m enrolled in school).</p>
<p>I started this fund raising to get the money to afford the cost of the living for at least the first year, so I have something to show them to get my student visa, it might help.</p>
<p>I really need to make this campaign work I have only 4 days left and if I don´t make it, even if I get enrolled succesfully at the University I won´t be accepted by the inmigration laws.</p>
<p>It´s been a long journey and I don´t want to see it falling down just because I don´t have the money</p>
<p>...as I was told since the begining!</p>
<p>It´s not that easy, it makes you feel vulnerable, sort of naked infront of the whole world, but if it´s what it takes to get where I want to be, I willing to!</p>

<p>Foreign Direct Investment has transformed northern Mexico and, in particular, Ciudad Juarez. It has contributed to tremendous economic growth but also has affected every aspect of daily life, from the environment, manufacturing, labor, urban planning, supply chains, violence, etc. Although the name of Ciudad Juarez, in recent years, has been known around the world as a place of crime and social distress, this border city should also be known as one of resiliency where Foreign Direct Investment can still play an essential and beneficial role.</p>
<p>Ciudad Juarez is now undertaking a dramatic effort to recover and use its strategic position to benefit its communities through better planning and management. In this context, two young, talented, and enterprising students from the Autonomous University of Ciudad Juarez (UACJ) have taken it upon themselves to study, understand and learn about the structures and practices governing Foreign Direct Investment in order to apply their knowledge to the benefit of Ciudad Juarez.</p>
<p>For many decades, Ciudad Juarez has been in a passive position with respect to capital flows and the laws which govern them. For the fist time in the city's and region's history, two students from UACJ are making an effort and commitment to understand these dynamics so that the region can play a more proactive role in realizing the substantial benefits of Foreign Direct investment.  </p>
<h3><b>What is the Foreign Direct Investment Moot (FDI Moot)?</b></h3>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>The Foreign Direct Investment International Arbitration Moot is an academic competition which simulates the international procedures for resolving disputes between Investors and States, through writing briefs and oral arguments, by bringing together students, professors and legal professionals from around the world. This year, 2014, the site of the competition will be Pepperdine University in Malibu, California (USA). Law Schools from all over the world can participate in this academic experience which teaches law students not only about International Investment Law and how to write memorials and argue in oral hearings, but also provides them a unique opportunity to practice with students from different countries and show their talents and capabilities to the practitioners and professors who serve as judges and arbitrators. More information can be found here: <a href=""http://www.fdimoot.org/index.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.fdimoot.org/index.php</a></p>
<h3><b>The Participation of a Team from Ciudad Juarez</b></h3>
<p>The FDI Moot has never included the participation of a team from anywhere in Mexico, much less a public university in the northern states. In fact, the team from Ciudad Juarez will be the only participating team from Mexico. Moreover, whereas private Mexican law schools sometimes participate in similar events, providing substantial financing to their teams, this year's participation from Ciudad Juarez is receiving no financing from UACJ. Indeed, up to this point, all expenses have been borne by the two participants, Hector and Monica, and their coach Patrick Schaefer.</p>
<h3>The Team</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Our two participants are Hector Arce and Monica Rubalcaba. Both are students of exceptional ability and strength of character. They have sacrificed a great deal in personal and economic terms to make it this far in the competition because of how important they know this project to be for their professional development and the future of the region.</p>
<p>Hector came to Ciudad Juarez five years ago from the state of Sonora in order to study Law at the UACJ. He has lived in Juarez independently, working his way through school, while still achieving the highest grade point average of the entire university.</p>
<p>Monica is a Ciudad Juarez native from a middle class family which has always encouraged her to achieve her academic and professional goals. She is about to begin her last year in UACJ Law School. In the past, Monica worked for the UACJ in research projects which helped to develop fundamental skills for the FDI Moot. She now has one of the top five grade point averages in UACJ Law School.</p>
<h3><b>The Coach</b></h3>
<p>Patrick Schaefer has been coaching Monica and Hector in this project since late April of 2014. As a lawyer specialized in International Investment and Financial Law, he has been able to provide instruction, guidance and preparation, as well as moral support for the team and the project. His knowledge and contribution to the effort have been essential to its success. Moreover, Patrick has been traveling from the United States to Ciudad Juarez three times a week, donating his time and energy to meet and study with the students at their university.</p>
<h3>What we Need?</h3>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Most of all, this effort has required strength of character, vision, and moral commitment. It is, after all, a labor of love. Even so, there are certain economic costs associated with the project. As mentioned previously, all involved are making significant sacrifices of time, energy and money. And, without the support of the university, it is critical to raise the funds for our travel to and lodging in California for the days of the competition later in October.</span></p>
<p>Bellow you will find a clarification of our costs. Even though the costs are relatively small in absolute terms, they represent an unreachable amount for Hector and Monica. Any assistance you can provide to this effort will make not only an unprecedented difference in the lives of Hector and Monica, but also in the lives and communities of Ciudad Juarez and Northern Mexico.<br/></p>

<p>Breakdown of costs:</p>

<p></p>
<p>Registration Fee: 767 USD (600 euros)</p>

<p>Business Suits: 1,000 USD (500 USD each student)</p>
<p>Food and incidentals: 840 (60 USD x 7 days x 2 students) USD</p>
<h3>Why is this project so important?</h3>
<div>Our project represents the courage and pioneering spirit of both these students and Ciudad Juarez. Not only do these individuals, Monica and Hector, seek to improve their own legal practice and knowledge, but also to do so for the benefit of their city and its future generations.</div>
<div>For Ciudad Juarez, and perhaps the entire border region, the importance of having professionals educated, knowledgeable and capable of dealing with Foreign Direct Investment is fundamental for the economic and social development of the city. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">This is an important and symbolic opportunity for Ciudad Juarez, a city that strives everyday to overcome its challenges, and we hope that you can play a part in creating a brighter future. </span>

<p>We will begin with approximately 40 people in Athens, on the 30 of May 2014. <br/><br/>
We have to admit that the structure of this initiative is alive, which means it
is growing and evolving even as we write this. Therefore, we do not
yet know all the answers . . .or even the questions. We just know that we are
committed to this initiative and we are inviting others to join us, because
if we wait to identify all the questions and answers we might never
start. <br/><br/>
We would like to invite you to be one of the next people who will participate
or contribute to the first 40!</p>
<p>Here is what we know for sure at this point:<br/><br/>
We will begin with 40 people in Octomber, in participating in a 3 month,
Transformative  Leadership Training, in Athens. This training is designed
to be of high impact to each person individually. During the course of the
three months, participants will have the opportunity to exam the nature of
their thinking, as it relates to themselves, their life, their family,
their work, their community and Greece. Then they will have an opportunity
to invent new thinking in these same areas where they would like to cause
a different outcome than the one they currently have. We promise
that these 3 months will be valuable.  </p>
<p>If you want to participate in the preparation process for a training like
that, you can participate in a three day workshop held in the 30 of May and an other three day workshop held in 20 of June.<br/>
At the conclusion of the preparation you will be invited to make a
commitment to continue. Be clear the continuation is completely separate
from the 3-day workshop. It is fine to commit only to the
workshop, although we really would love it if you choose to continue, but
that will be for you to decide then. Nevertheless, we would like you to
know that we will invite you to participate in the follow up sessions of
the workshop and if you choose to participate in the 3 months Leadership
Training you will commit to the following: <br/><br/>
&gt; Take on a project in your life that benefits the Greek society, to be
accomplished within three months. This should be something which you have
no idea how you could accomplish it, you would love it, and it looks
highly unlikely that you could do it. Something that would make a
difference and that is specific and measureable. You will design this
during the training, if you choose to. You will receive coaching to support you
in fulfilling this project!  </p>
<p><b>Follow-up sessions</b></p>
<p>You will be invited to participate in a minimum of 4 out of 6, 3-hour
follow up sessions over the course of one year. These will usually take
place on a Weeknight from 19:00 to 22:00.</p>

</div> <p><br/></p></div>","Hi, we are a bunch of friends living in Dublin city and some of us have lost loved ones to cancer in recent months. These pretty tragic events have been lengthy roller coaster journeys but with the help of Hospice services we were able to rely on end of life care, support  and protection. At a time of pain and helplessness that was the biggest relief and gift as our time could be devoted to our loved ones and the memories that we could still create with them. Empowered with such gratitude we are now aiming at fundraising €3000 for the Laura Lynn Children's Hospice, which provides transitional care, home support, respite and end-of-life care for all children with life limiting conditions and their families. Any of your donations will go a long way in making the Hospice more accessible and in helping the pursuit of opening a second Hospice in Ireland.
 In our effort and to show our commitment we have decided to challenge ourselves with climbing the four highest peaks of Ireland and spice things up with a little competition between boys and girls, even though we all play for the same team!)

Your funds, for example, will help us create a new clean energy and life sustaining think-tank that will comprise leading experts and activists who can begin to implement strategies for a cleaner healthier plant. Pulitzer Prize winning writer, Chris Hedges and Activist, Boris Franklin discuss the School to Prison Pipeline in the USA at the GCAS ""Democracy Rising"" workshop in New York.We believe there is more than enough intellectual capacity to outthink our planet's challenges, to provide courage and confidence in each other to stand-up and speak truth to unjust power, to racism, economic inequality, and to change how the world functions economically and educationally. Recently GCAS helped found the first degree granting higher education institution in the world operated by intellectuals and activists that seeks to provide low-cost, high-quality BA, MA, and PhD programs in ""Social and Political Thought""--GCAS-Research Institute, Ireland.GCAS has held seminars and events at the Centre Pompidou, Paris, Havana, Cuba, Athens, Greece, Brooklyn, New York, Philadelphia, USA, Berlin, Germany, Maribor, Slovenia and next month in Santiago, Chile. With your help we can continue expanding and creating centers of empowerment in new countries in which proposals and research can be formulated and published and new life can be giving through a progressive network.Nelson Mandela once said, “Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.” What the elite few do not want us to do is to question how the world functions today in a manner that offers and proposes solutions. We propose them--we create them.Distinguished Professor at Harvard University says: ""This Global Center for Advanced Studies is what many of us, languishing in established academic institutions, have dreamed of for many years. I will seize the opportunity to show how the intellectual life can be engaged in the life of the world, how scholarship can escape the sclerotic and alienated language it passes off as edifying, and how critical thought can develop new forms of writing that speak to those outside of the academy and to those inside it who have been waiting, like pupae, for spring."" --Professor Michael JacksonKhanyile Mlotshwa (Zimbabwe) ""GCAS has given me access to an amazing education and conversation that links up Africa to Europe and North American. This is the future of education"" Hekatherina Clara Delgado (Uruguay) ""I'm a street artist and performer and GCAS has been a lifeline for me to connect up my work with other struggles around the world.""Other GCAS ResourcesGCAS E-School provides education to anyone in the world.In addition to teaching on-line and in selected locations around the world, we also provide a free public news program, Interventions. We have a peer reviewed open-access and free journal, ""Engaged Studies in Humanities and Social Sciences"" via GCAS-RII. Be part of building a true alternative. We are not THE solution, but we do our part to create one.A video from the founder and director of GCAS, Dr. Creston Davis Join us--Let's Create a Better World Together",5.0,4,"1 Campaign

But for those with minimal education, it is a disaster with no means of fixing. Alternative income streams like beekeeping, developing seed and plant nurseries for replanting natural and tolerant species, composting - all seem so easy and even obvious to us but with no means, they are just not going to happen without some outside help.THE BIRTH OF NDANDANLA TANKARAN KAAFO I have just returned from another trip to Jinack, where this time I purposely met with the members of the community and the Village Development Committee, and talked about their issues, and spoke especially with the principal of the school - Sulayman Saho - who is completely onboard with Sarjo and my idea for an after school Environmental Protection Club.And so Ndandanla Tankaran Kaafo was born - an after school Environmental Protection Club for children to learn about their environment and the issues facing not just them but the rest of the world. The children will be the champions for their community, expected to pass on their learnings and write reports and put on plays and performances about the issue of the month, and thereby extend the knowledge throughout their families and neighbours. We have developed a specific curriculum for them, with outings off island to visit other communities and see more of their own country, and exchange with other groups, monthly clean up days where they will be rewarded for how many of their friends and other villagers they convince to get involved, a sapling and composting project for the school nursery and also beekeeping if we can raise the money to get the hives. It is a small idea - nothing grand and earth shattering, but then the best ideas should be small and manageable to begin with. In the case of our Environmental Protection Club, the kids are already bursting with their own ideas, and enthusiasm for passing on their knowledge to their community - which is the point. WHERE ANY FUNDING WILL GOFunding is for set up costs - the cost of seeds for the nursery, decent footwear, Tshirts and hats for the kids, gloves and bags for the monthly clean up days, the cost to pay for field trips and food, and also stipends for the teachers who will be giving up their time after classes. Beehives and even books will be a bonus too. (and infact if anyone wants to send natural history or earth sciences books or DVDs, they will be gratefully received too!) The kids have agreed to keep everyone updated on their progress and learnings - so I will be posting images of them and the reports they write - so we can all see how well they are doing and feed off their enthusiasm.One of the first steps is also training for the teachers - Sarjo will be leading some sessions about environmental education and the issues on the island. Unfortunately they also don't know, have never been taught and it is important that they are teaching from a place of understanding too.AIMS AND OBJECTIVES (as worked out on island with the team)
To promote student's understanding of their environment and biodiversity
To be responsive to global changes / climate change
To manage and protect natural resources, on Jinack but also across The Gambia
To embark on a tree planting exercise and nursery composting project
To expose students to different environments in their own country
To sensitize the broader community to the effects of climate change and environmental threats generally in their region
To create awareness on the management and sustainable utilisation of marine resources
To broaden the community's awareness about waste management
Activities:
Nursery and seed bank, with composting project (focus on local species and salt tolerant species - coconuts for example)
Tree planting to start combating soil erosion locally
Drinking pool for birds
Monthly garbage clean-up exercise, encouraging village involvement
Reports / theatre / presentations to parents and community about learnings in a bid to educate outwards and create awareness and action
Bee keeping - alternative income potential
Teacher training
Excursions to key sites - mangroves, regional national parks, bird watching and idenitification, landscape understanding etc
£25 will pay for seeds and some saplings for the nursery and tree planting project£50 will pay for equipment needed for a village clean up - gloves, bags, wheelbarrow, shovels£200 will pay for a field trip for a group of students to visit their natural environment - transport, food, proper shoesAny sum welcome, all will be gratefully received and well used! And I'll still be fundraising outside of this forum too, so fingers crossed for corporates and foundations.THANKYOU FOR YOUR HELP IN ADVANCEI know in these hard times there are a million causes and a million ways to spend your money, and if you aren't excited like me about making a small difference in a small place then I understand.But the brilliance of crowd funding is if this is not your particular cause, then it might be for someone you know. So I am asking if you could please share with your friends - the more people who know and can decide if this is something they want to support the better.Thankyou - from me, from the team on Jinack (Sarjo, Amadou, Sulayman and Hammeh) and from the kids in The Gambia who will have the benefit of something we take for granted, and can take their learnings to their community and hopefully make some positive changes.",9.0,0,"2 Campaigns

</ul><p><u>Mission</u><u>
of the DOSTI project</u></p>
<p>The mission of the DOSTI project is to create a safer and
more tolerant educational environment in high schools and the community
at-large.</p>
<p>The 1999 McCreary Centre Study of Queer Youth in B.C.
found that 34% of queer youth have been threatened with violence at school; 17%
have been physically assaulted; and 71% have seriously considered suicide while
45% claim to have actually attempted suicide.  </p>
<p>In May 2008, Equality for Gays and Lesbians Everywhere
(EGALE), in a nationwide survey, found that 41% of queer youth had been
sexually harassed compared to 19% of straight youth.</p>
<p><strong>The
report found that homophobia and transphobia is linked to poor performance in
school, dropout rates, and teen suicides.  </strong></p>
<p>Almost 40% of straight participants reported they made
homophobic remarks sometimes or frequently compared to 19% for queer
youth.  </p>
<p>54% of straight participants and 61% of queer
participants reported they had not been taught about queer issues in any school
classes or assemblies over the past year.</p>
<p><u>Presentation
Feedback from Teachers </u></p>
<p>“Alex’s
presentation – especially at Tamanawis, where there are many South Asian
students – is fascinating and thought-provoking.  Students from diverse backgrounds get to see
a visible-minority who is out (and proud, and articulate) share his story and
the student reaction typically is something along the lines of “wow – respect -
Mr. Sangha has overcome some serious challenges, and his presentation has been
really interesting.  I am hoping Alex can
keep coming back to Tamanawis with his presentation, which ties in perfectly
with the Social Justice 12 curriculum’s LGBTQ unit.”</p>

I have had many of my students who have gone off to jobs, colleges, and

changed their perspectives for the better. 
I credit Alex with much of the impact on my students in that unit.  He can do in an hour what I cannot in weeks .

<p>Countries throughout the world use a foreign language as the medium of instruction. In Tanzania, 99 percent of the population speaks Kiswahili and only 5 percent of the population speaks English. But all secondary school classes are taught in English, obstructing student access to quality education. </p>
<p><strong><strong>What can we do? </strong></strong>With your help, we will implement a research-based, six-week after-school program that relies on the power of indigenous languages to support classroom discussion, fosters appreciation for local language and identity and ensures students have access to quality education. It promotes access for all students and enables meaningful educational opportunities. This pilot program will inform a two-year, in-school education program and ultimately, provide the knowledge to pursue research-based education reform that better meets the needs of Tanzanian and international students around the globe. </p>
<p><strong>Why is this so important?</strong> Education policy has failed to acknowledge the difference between learning a language and learning <em>in</em> a language. Without access to a familiar language in the classroom, teachers feel inadequate and unable to communicate effectively with their students. Students become disengaged and apathetic and the classroom becomes a place of boredom and silence, leading to massive increases in dropout rates. But teachers want to teach. And classrooms should be exciting and full of loud, inquisitive voices. Kids need to stay in school and develop the knowledge and skills to raise their quality of life.</p>
<p><strong>How can <em>you</em> help?</strong> With your support, the money raised from this campaign will cover all expenses associated with printing the teaching and learning materials. </p>
<p>Your support will also help us distribute the first 800 student books and 20 teachers guides among four rural low-performing schools in Tanzania. If we surpass our funding goal, all additional money will be used to add schools, students and teachers!</p>
<p><strong>Do you want to know more?</strong> The pilot program will demonstrate the benefits of using indigenous languages to improve teaching and learning among multilingual populations. Through purposeful and strategic use of indigenous African languages, math, literature, civics and English can become subjects of inquiry instead of alienation. </p>
<p>The pilot program is an avenue to develop a larger in-school program and gain the political leverage we need to get endorsement from the Tanzanian Ministry of Education for the multilingual populations under its jurisdiction. Through evaluation of the pilot program, we will be able to suggest data-driven strategies for scale-up and replication that ensure that curricular content and objectives meet local and national educational needs.</p>
<p>The approach merges contemporary research on language and learning as well as on existing teacher classroom practices. This is the most unique component! We learned from our teachers, and combined their successful strategies to help them learn from one another and more effectively engage their students.</p>
<p><strong>To show you how much we believe in this project,</strong> we will match your contributions! If this campaign is successful, our team will return to Tanzania in September. While there, we will work with the teaching community and provide professional development workshops to ensure teachers feel confident and capable using these materials in their classrooms. This also helps ensure that more of their feedback will be incorporated into future programming. Teachers know what they need to create a successful learning environment. Let's get them what they need!</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>Who is behind this bilingual learning program? </strong>A glimpse into our story: With 45 years' combined teaching experience across the globe, seven friends compared notes and realized we struggled with the same problem — that when we speak the local language in our classrooms, our students are engaged, motivated and confident about their learning. Despite this reality, education policy inhibits the use of local languages in the classroom. Thus, we decided to develop this six week pilot program to demonstrate the benefits of local language use and lay a research-based foundation to inform education reform.</p></div>","If students don't understand the language of instruction, how can they learn subjects taught in that language?

And classrooms should be exciting and full of loud, inquisitive voices. Kids need to stay in school and develop the knowledge and skills to raise their quality of life.
How can you help? With your support, the money raised from this campaign will cover all expenses associated with printing the teaching and learning materials. 
Your support will also help us distribute the first 800 student books and 20 teachers guides among four rural low-performing schools in Tanzania. If we surpass our funding goal, all additional money will be used to add schools, students and teachers!
Do you want to know more? The pilot program will demonstrate the benefits of using indigenous languages to improve teaching and learning among multilingual populations. Through purposeful and strategic use of indigenous African languages, math, literature, civics and English can become subjects of inquiry instead of alienation. 
The pilot program is an avenue to develop a larger in-school program and gain the political leverage we need to get endorsement from the Tanzanian Ministry of Education for the multilingual populations under its jurisdiction. Through evaluation of the pilot program, we will be able to suggest data-driven strategies for scale-up and replication that ensure that curricular content and objectives meet local and national educational needs.
The approach merges contemporary research on language and learning as well as on existing teacher classroom practices. This is the most unique component! We learned from our teachers, and combined their successful strategies to help them learn from one another and more effectively engage their students.
To show you how much we believe in this project, we will match your contributions! If this campaign is successful, our team will return to Tanzania in September. While there, we will work with the teaching community and provide professional development workshops to ensure teachers feel confident and capable using these materials in their classrooms. This also helps ensure that more of their feedback will be incorporated into future programming. Teachers know what they need to create a successful learning environment. Let's get them what they need!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Who is behind this bilingual learning program? A glimpse into our story: With 45 years' combined teaching experience across the globe, seven friends compared notes and realized we struggled with the same problem — that when we speak the local language in our classrooms, our students are engaged, motivated and confident about their learning. Despite this reality, education policy inhibits the use of local languages in the classroom. Thus, we decided to develop this six week pilot program to demonstrate the benefits of local language use and lay a research-based foundation to inform education reform.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Greetings and Thank You for considering my campaign. I promise to be honest and up-front about my situation - in hopes that you will further consider funding my campaign.</p>
<p>My name is Robert, and I owe Sallie Mae (a large student lending institution) a substantial amount of money. I do not blame others for my problems, but I also feel no shame for asking for help when it is needed.</p>
<p>(I apologize in advance for the vagueness, but I do not want to violate any OPSEC regulations) I joined the armed forces because I was unable to find a job after college that would pay enough to cover my payments to Sallie Mae. I joined when a recruiter told me that my particular branch offers a student loan repayment program. However, what the recruiter failed to mention, was that only federally subsidized loans are covered by this program. Unfortunately, my loans through Sallie Mae are not federally subsidized.</p>
<p>Currently, approximately 95% of my paycheck goes to either Sallie Mae or my family. It is difficult for both me and my wife, as we are now beginning to realize just how long we are going to have to endure this financial burden. Looking back, I realize that the 17 year old version of myself was probably not mature enough to make these types of financial decisions. However, I know now that I need to do everything I can to solve this problem, for myself and for my family.</p>
<p>I am not asking for my entire loan to be repayed, the fund request you see is to remove any interest has, and still is, compounding since I took the loan.</p>
<p>The true strength of a country is not measured by those on the front lines, it is and always has been measured by the cooperation of its population.</p>
<p>I appreciate your help and support, even if you do not donate to my cause.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get: <em>Pre-Paid Mastercard Gift Cards</em>
</h3>
<p>As I am currently overseas, it is difficult for me to send things to you in return. However, thanks to the magic of the internet (and my wife), I am offering pre-paid gift cards as perks for donations. <em><strong>PLEASE NOTE! THESE CARDS CANNOT BE SENT TO ALASKA, ARIZONA, HAWAII, PO BOXES, or ANYWHERE OUTSIDE THE</strong></em><strong> USA!</strong> I apologize for this shipping restriction, but I have limited options with where I am currently stationed.</p>
<p>You might also notice that there are two $100 donation options. The reason for this is that when I had initially set up this account, I was not offering any perk rewards because it would be difficult to organize delivery from overseas. However, I have made new perk rewards and the web site would not let me delete the duplicate options. But, <em><strong>If you accidentally select the $100 option which has no perk associated with it, you will still receive a certificate and gift card</strong> </em>provided that you give me your name, email, and adress. <em><strong>If you do not provide a proper email or mailing adress, I will do my best to contact you and get you your gift card.</strong></em>If I am unable to contact you due to incomplete information, incorrect information, or if you list your adress as being in the areas which cannot be shipped to, I apologize for any confusion, and I will do my best to correct what is correctable.</p>
<p>Should my goal be reached, or even if it isnt, I will take anything I recieve and use it to pay Sallie Mae. Upon processing of the payment, I will post a screenshot of my acount balances page (with important information omitted, of course), so you may see the impact of your kindness.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Besides the financial effects of your kindness, you must also realize that you are helping one struggling family stay strong and optimistic for the future. We are in difficult times right now, both financially and emotionally. The stress of being away from home, on top of being in this much debt can sometimes be too much. We are reaching out to you for help and support.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cannot contribute financially, I would like you to know that your sympathy and understanding are also appreciated. There are some who use the 'blame the victim' fallacy to describe those of us who find ourselves in student loan debt. If you want to help in other ways - please educate yourself and those you know about the dangers of student loan debt (which are not dischargable in bankruptcy or even death - whereupon they are transferred to your co-signer). Also, stay informed on current and future legislation on student loan debt. Contact your representatives and let them know that student borrowers need the same protections as other loan borrowers. Be sure to know who you are voting for and where they stand on this issue. Right now, I am doing everything I can to correct what mistakes I have made - but I do not want my children, or your children to have to live the same way I am.</p>

And people, who play sports professionally, also face the same problem as a drug. Our project is aimed at promoting healthy lifestyle among young people and among athletes. Teenagers who involved in sport process less thinking about the possibility of drug use, so our skate park is not only a great place for having fun, but also a place that fosters a healthy generation free from drug addiction and alcoholism.</p>

Our mission is not to stay aside in the struggle with the problems affecting the development of society.</p>

<p> Skate boarding and Roller sport – are types of sport that allow people who are not attracted by traditional or team ones, to develop physically, to lead an active and healthy life, to establish themselves in society. Skate Park is a place of communication and daily meetings of athletes who are ready to spend most of their time exercising. With the growing general interest in alternative sports we can build friendship, the bonds which are often couldn’t be destroyed for the whole life. Youth involvement in the construction of social life through selected types of sport helps awaken in young people the desire for a positive assessment of their personality and motivate to work hard and develop. At the same time, providing youth with the necessary needs for their favorite sport and communication, we can increase youth social responsibility and loyalty to the city property and municipal structures. A well-designed and built skate park is a place of creative and sports activities, a place where with great interest will be gathered adults and children who are fond of skateboarding and other types of alternative sports to be engaged in a positive atmosphere of beautiful and spectacular activity.</p>

Our project is aimed at promoting healthy lifestyle among young people and among athletes. Teenagers who involved in sport process less thinking about the possibility of drug use, so our skate park is not only a great place for having fun, but also a place that fosters a healthy generation free from drug addiction and alcoholism.
 Let's say with the whole world there are no drugs.
 Our team consists of young professionals in the field of family entertainment and youth development in Republic of Kazakhstan. For the past 7 years, we are trying to make as many projects as we can for families and young generation by showing them the importance of healthy living. Our mission is not to stay aside in the struggle with the problems affecting the development of society.
 We are responsible for what our world will be tomorrow!
 The significance of this project is to fight for a healthy way of life and the development of sport for young people.
       ""Champions aren't made in gyms. Champions are made from something they have deep inside them: A desire, a dream, a vision.""

 Skate boarding and Roller sport – are types of sport that allow people who are not attracted by traditional or team ones, to develop physically, to lead an active and healthy life, to establish themselves in society. Skate Park is a place of communication and daily meetings of athletes who are ready to spend most of their time exercising. With the growing general interest in alternative sports we can build friendship, the bonds which are often couldn’t be destroyed for the whole life. Youth involvement in the construction of social life through selected types of sport helps awaken in young people the desire for a positive assessment of their personality and motivate to work hard and develop. At the same time, providing youth with the necessary needs for their favorite sport and communication, we can increase youth social responsibility and loyalty to the city property and municipal structures.

<p><strong>Let's save the Land of Frankincense</strong></p>
<p>My name is Brian Miller, I am an artist who is fortunate enough to be married to an archaeologist. I am spending the summer helping out on an archaeological excavation at Al Baleed, Oman, also known as the Land of Frankincense. Al Baleed is a Unesco World Heritage site and the largest archaeological site in Oman. The ancient port city of Al Baleed served as a hub of trading between the west and the far east and was the primary port for exporting frankincense. My wife, Kristy Miller, is working with Dr. Krista Lewis, Sarah Graff, and Lamya Khalidi. The locals refer to them as, ""The 4 Doctors"". Dr. Lewis and her team are doing amazing work excavating and preserving the buildings and artifacts at Al Baleed.</p>
<p>You can get involved with this archaeological excavation by supplying some of the much needed technology, lab equipment, and field supplies for the 2013 excavation season.</p>
<p><strong>Technology needs:</strong> The 4 Doctors are using iPads to collect data and images in the field. One iPad was supplied by UALR, the rest were purchased at the expense of the archaeologists who are using them to record information in the field and photograph the Al Baleed site. These iPads are encased by military spec cases to protect against sand and water damage. An iPad is also being used in the field lab to document and catalog each artifact. There is a laptop in the lab where Dr. Lewis has created a database for the excavation. The one missing element is the require specialized software to sync the information collected via iPad to the database. The cost of this software is over $900 for the laptop and 4 iPads. This software is important for to ensure the artifacts are cataloged properly for the Museum of the Land of Frankincense. The database will also ensure the artifacts can be studied in the future allowing The 4 Doctors to learn more about the lives of the people who worked and lived in Al Baleed. Other technology needs include a scanner to capture cross sections of pottery and a printer.</p>
<p><strong>Field and Lab Supplies:</strong> The team also needs supplies for use in the field and lab. When the artifacts are collected in the field they are currently being transferred to he lab using readily available (and cheap) plastic bags which can trap moisture potentially damaging delicate pottery and metals while awaiting cleaning and cataloging. The team would like to purchase cloth bags along with tags, drying trays, and archival storage containers to ensure the artifacts found are preserved for future research and museum display. In addition The 4 Doctors need scientific equipment like a microscope, scales, &amp; calipers. Many of these items can be purchased once and used for years to come.</p>
<p>Dr. Krista Lewis and her team are working with the Museum of the Land of Frankincense and the Sultanate of Oman to save this historical site for the world. Your contribution directly goes to preserve the buildings and artifacts unearthed at Al Baleed - the Land of Frankincense.</p>

<p> </p></div>","Let's save the Land of Frankincense
My name is Brian Miller, I am an artist who is fortunate enough to be married to an archaeologist. I am spending the summer helping out on an archaeological excavation at Al Baleed, Oman, also known as the Land of Frankincense. Al Baleed is a Unesco World Heritage site and the largest archaeological site in Oman. The ancient port city of Al Baleed served as a hub of trading between the west and the far east and was the primary port for exporting frankincense. My wife, Kristy Miller, is working with Dr. Krista Lewis, Sarah Graff, and Lamya Khalidi. The locals refer to them as, ""The 4 Doctors"". Dr. Lewis and her team are doing amazing work excavating and preserving the buildings and artifacts at Al Baleed.
You can get involved with this archaeological excavation by supplying some of the much needed technology, lab equipment, and field supplies for the 2013 excavation season.
Technology needs: The 4 Doctors are using iPads to collect data and images in the field. One iPad was supplied by UALR, the rest were purchased at the expense of the archaeologists who are using them to record information in the field and photograph the Al Baleed site. These iPads are encased by military spec cases to protect against sand and water damage. An iPad is also being used in the field lab to document and catalog each artifact. There is a laptop in the lab where Dr. Lewis has created a database for the excavation. The one missing element is the require specialized software to sync the information collected via iPad to the database. The cost of this software is over $900 for the laptop and 4 iPads. This software is important for to ensure the artifacts are cataloged properly for the Museum of the Land of Frankincense. The database will also ensure the artifacts can be studied in the future allowing The 4 Doctors to learn more about the lives of the people who worked and lived in Al Baleed. Other technology needs include a scanner to capture cross sections of pottery and a printer.
Field and Lab Supplies: The team also needs supplies for use in the field and lab. When the artifacts are collected in the field they are currently being transferred to he lab using readily available (and cheap) plastic bags which can trap moisture potentially damaging delicate pottery and metals while awaiting cleaning and cataloging. The team would like to purchase cloth bags along with tags, drying trays, and archival storage containers to ensure the artifacts found are preserved for future research and museum display. In addition The 4 Doctors need scientific equipment like a microscope, scales, & calipers. Many of these items can be purchased once and used for years to come.
Dr. Krista Lewis and her team are working with the Museum of the Land of Frankincense and the Sultanate of Oman to save this historical site for the world. Your contribution directly goes to preserve the buildings and artifacts unearthed at Al Baleed - the Land of Frankincense.

I began my journey as a transfer student and Sociology major at California State University, Northridge - I was looking for some way to get involved on campus, and it was suggested that since I'm a Democrat, maybe I should see if there is a political club around.

Last year I was elected and able to serve as a delegate representing my congressional district at the 2012 Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, and was also elected and currently represent my assembly district as a delegate in the state party. Currently, I serve as the Grants Director for San Fernando Valley Young Democrats, a board member of the Democratic Party of the San Fernando Valley, and the Marketing and Communications Chair for (the Los Angeles chapter) of Planned Parenthood Young Professionals.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I have developed an analysis project that will study the results of one particular non-governmental organization — an NGO by the name of THE CHILDREN’S MEDICAL CARE FOUNDATION, which aids Eastern European children — and through my analysis enable Children’s Medical Care Foundation to determine which of the Foundation's efforts are using their tight resources on the best means possible to help the children under their care. The money donated here will fund my 3-month, on-location, fact-gathering project in Poland and the Ukraine.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Full Story</h3>
<p>As the mother of a happy and energetic 19 month old, like most mothers my child’s health and well-being are always at the forefront of my mind. I find comfort in knowing that in case of sickness or possible emergency my child has access to proper and modern health care. </p>
<p>My child is one of the lucky ones. Sadly not all mothers can share in the comfort of knowing proper health care is available for their infants and children. Even with new technological advancements, the health care of children remains inadequate in many parts of the world.</p>
<p>This is the sad reality in some Eastern European nations, including Poland, the Ukraine and Latvia.  Being of Polish descent my heart feels especially tied to those children, and I am determined to help them. It is my intent to be a voice for these children.</p>
<p>I have developed an analysis project that will study the results of one particular NGO — the CHILDREN’S MEDICAL CARE FOUNDATION — and through my analyses enable them to determine which of the Foundation’s efforts are using their tight resources on the best means possible to help the children under their care.</p>
<p>For three decades The Children’s Medical Care Foundation has been at the forefront of the ongoing battle to preserve the life and health of ailing infants and children. This organization’s efforts in sharing vital, up-to-date medical knowledge with training for pediatricians and specialists from Poland, Ukraine and Latvia has resulted in a sharp reduction of infant deaths, most notably in Poland.</p>
<p>As a single mother and full-time student at Claremont Graduate University working towards two Masters degrees, I am struggling to make ends meet. Any contributions provided will be used for travel expenses, food and lodging, research materials, and any other fees acquired related to the research project. I hope that you will share in my passion for helping the next generation of Eastern European children receive the best medical care available by supporting my summer research of The Children’s Medical Care Foundation, an organization that strives to makes this possible.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As the first person to assess the Foundation’s effectiveness in helping children, I am traveling to Poland and the Ukraine for three months this summer to conduct data-gathering research in the form of personal observation, interviews and surveys. Upon collection I will publish this data, and provide the public and The Children’s Medical Care Foundation with as thorough an analysis as possible, so that the Foundation’s activity can thrive and expand its efforts on behalf of children for future decades.</p>
<p>I feel extremely compelled to help the Foundation, through this research project,  to build on its strengths, improve weaknesses, and adapt to the evolving and chronic health care threats in infants and children in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Why? Because healthcare is a basic fundamental human right, access to the best medical care should never be denied to infants and children. </p>
<p>Every child deserves a chance at life, the fulfillment of their dreams, and realization of true potentials. Sick and weak children cannot grow into those who will build strong societies. The active and continuous progress of The Children’s Medical Care Foundation is fundamental to this goal for infants and children in Poland, the Ukraine, and Latvia.</p>

<h2><strong>DATE OF EVENT: JUNE 16TH, 2012</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>TIME OF EVENT: 2:00pm</strong></h2>
<h2>
<strong>PLACE OF EVENT: </strong>The West Steps of the State Capitol.</h2>
<p>Slutwalk Sacramento is apart of an international grassroots movement aimed to combat rape culture and to promote sexual empowerment. It erupted after a Toronto Police officer (2011) stated during a York University forum on safety: Women should avoid dressing like SLUTS in order not to get [sexually] victimized. <br/><br/>1 out of every 6 American women has been the victim of an attempted or completed rape in her lifetime; 1 in 33 American men have experienced an attempted or completed rape in his lifetime, and only 6% of rapists will ever spend a day in jail (RAIIN). Criminalizing the innocent is one of the primary reasons 15 out of 16 rapists walk away freely without penalty (Rape, abuse, and incest national network). According to Jaclyn Friedman a huge majority of rapes are perpetrated by a small minority of guys who do it again and again. They rape an average of 6 times each, and continue to do so, because we let them. Because as a culture we give them a ""social license to operate."" Because we turn around and say ""she shouldnt have put herself in that situation."" Why was she walking by herself at night? Why did she wear a G-string and short skirt? She was playing hard to get. She told me no, but her body said yes. Shes a SLUT. Women of color don't want to be made love to, they just like to get F*CKED. He/She is a hooker-it doesnt count.

TIME OF EVENT: 2:00pm

PLACE OF EVENT: The West Steps of the State Capitol.
Slutwalk Sacramento is apart of an international grassroots movement aimed to combat rape culture and to promote sexual empowerment. It erupted after a Toronto Police officer (2011) stated during a York University forum on safety: Women should avoid dressing like SLUTS in order not to get [sexually] victimized. 1 out of every 6 American women has been the victim of an attempted or completed rape in her lifetime; 1 in 33 American men have experienced an attempted or completed rape in his lifetime, and only 6% of rapists will ever spend a day in jail (RAIIN). Criminalizing the innocent is one of the primary reasons 15 out of 16 rapists walk away freely without penalty (Rape, abuse, and incest national network). According to Jaclyn Friedman a huge majority of rapes are perpetrated by a small minority of guys who do it again and again. They rape an average of 6 times each, and continue to do so, because we let them. Because as a culture we give them a ""social license to operate."" Because we turn around and say ""she shouldnt have put herself in that situation."" Why was she walking by herself at night? Why did she wear a G-string and short skirt? She was playing hard to get. She told me no, but her body said yes. Shes a SLUT. Women of color don't want to be made love to, they just like to get F*CKED. He/She is a hooker-it doesnt count. He didn't get raped, he's gay...Boys will be boys... The more and more we perpetuate these SOCIAL MYTHS and STIGMAS, the more we are creating a world with more rapists for all of us to live in. When someone becomes a victim of sexual violence theyve been robbed to the right to their own body. Rape & sexual assault are violations of human rights. Sexual assault is not a sexual expression.

<h3>About the Oaksterdam University Veterans Freedom Fighter Scholarship Fund</h3>
<p>Cannabis has been shown to be helpful in reintegrating veterans into civilian life after traumatic brain injury, neuropathic pain and PTSD, or simply as a harm reduction technique safer than alcohol and many Rx drugs.  We believe it is unpatriotic to deny these heroes the very medication that helps them, and then criminalize it.  Oaksterdam University is launching the Veterans Freedom Fighter Scholarship Fund as Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Reaches Epidemic Proportions.  The men and women who serve in the United States military deserve the honor, respect and thanks of a grateful nation. While no single act can truly thank those who served, we can provide them with education leading to better quality of life and opportunity here at home.  </p>
<p>We are raising money to cover our small tuition fee for these veterans.  We are turning to crowd-sourced funding because we believe a small investment in a brave soul returning home can completely alter the rest of their lives for the better.</p>
<p>Dale Sky Jones, Oaksterdam University’s Executive Chancellor, announced the formation of the Veterans Freedom Fighter Scholarship Fund on Veterans' Day.  The private fund will help to fulfill this promise with financial aid options to help over 100 returning veterans to define their own success at home, by preparing them to succeed with Oaksterdam University's multifaceted curriculum.  Private contributions are needed for Veterans, who will be taught how to be safe and responsible under state law, develop skills for successful law enforcement encounters, take control of their medication and find employment.</p>
<p>“Viet Nam vets have shown me that, in many cases, cannabis is the one medicine that has consistently helped their seriously disabling symptoms, allowing them to function, hold jobs, keep their relationships intact, and raise families for the past 30 or so years, when years of therapy and numerous meds have not,” explains Frank H. Lucido, MD in Berkeley, CA.</p>

<p>Negative military service characterizations carry significant consequences. Eligibility for VA benefits, including GI Bill and home loan guarantees, can be restricted and in many cases barred. In addition, a veteran might be disqualified from federal, state and local government employment.

<p>A recent <a href=""http://www.drugpolicy.org/resource/healing-broken-system-veterans-and-war-drugs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Drug Policy Alliance Report</a> illustrates roughly 30 percent of veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan report symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), traumatic brain injury, depression, mental illness or other cognitive disability, making integration back into civilian life even more difficult.  Veterans suffering from PTSD often have negative law enforcement encounters.  Left untreated, these medical conditions often contribute to substance abuse, fatal overdose, homelessness and suicide, as well as violations of the law, particularly nonviolent drug offenses. </p>
<p>The statistics are alarming: about 18 veterans take their lives each day. In fact, suicide is now the leading cause of death in the army, with more soldiers dying by suicide than in combat.  Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among American soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan has reached epidemic proportions, affecting between 75,000 to 225,000 veterans.  The <a href=""https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=gmail&amp;attid=0.4&amp;thid=13ae25cab30dc6c3&amp;mt=application/pdf&amp;url=https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ui%3D2%26ik%3D234bba7e9e%26view%3Datt%26th%3D13ae25cab30dc6c3%26attid%3D0.4%26disp%3Dsafe%26zw&amp;sig=AHIEtbT0K80XHm3DJSqZA4pzHJ-JAqVOPg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">use of cannabis and cannabinoids likely mitigates symptoms</a> associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), according to a review of clinical and preclinical <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dta.1377/abstract"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">evidence published online in the scientific journal Drug Testing and Analysis.</a>  The study concluded, “Cannabis might make it easier for people with PTSD to rest or sleep and to feel less anxious and less involved with flashback memories.  Evidence is increasingly accumulating that cannabinoids might play a role in fear extinction and anti-depressive effects.

<p>Getaboard is a 501c3 non-profit organization that teaches homeless, under privileged and at-risk youth how to surf, skateboard and do art. We have found that according to a 2009 <em>Harvard Graduate School of Education</em> report, extracurricular activities, such as skateboarding and art:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increases a child's academic performance and school attendance</li>
<li>Decreases a child's chance of involvement in drugs and juvenile delinquency</li>
</ul><p>In such desperate times, providing quality, engaging activities and solid role models has never been of greater importance to our youth and our country. A recent CBS 60 MINUTES Special, <em>Hard Times Generation</em>, stated Florida has the third largest homeless population in the United States and growing. There are over 10,000 homeless children living in central Florida, alone.</p>
<p> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs5--QZ98Fk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs5--QZ98Fk</a></p>
<p>This scenario combined with a recent report from Psychology Today's Teen Angst segment stating that homeless youth are 50% more likely than average students to drop out of high school due to unstable home lives, potential domestic violence and food scarcity creates a looming concern. Each high school drop-out costs our society $340,000.00 over their lifetime, due to their dependence on housing, food, and medical care. Also, 82% of all prisoners incarcerated in America, today, are high school dropouts.</p>
<p><strong>We can see the problem. So let's work on the solution and break the cycle!</strong></p>
<p>For the past 2 years the Getaboard Foundation has been working with the Coalition for the Homeless, providing our Getaboard Skateboarding program which helps homeless children, going through a turbulent time in their lives, learn how to properly skateboard and do art in exchange for taking our Life Target Test. This simple test, helps these kids discover a career that best fits their personality type while planting a seed of hope and a positive self image of themselves to carry into the future. A child with a dream can overcome any obstacle.</p>
<p>Our Getaboard Skateboarding program offers our students a chance to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use quality skateboards, safety gear and equipment</li>
<li>Be instructed by knowledgeable, pre-screened, volunteer skateboarding and art instructors</li>
<li>Build self esteem and a positive self image through newly acquired skills and a new found sense of self awareness</li>
</ul><p>At the end of each six week session, during our Getaboard Board Awards, each child is rewarded their own skateboard, helmet and Getaboard tee shirt for passing our program.</p>
<p>Our goal is to positively impact the lives of over 250 homeless children through our Getaboard Skateboarding program in 2013. Each child's ""Board Award"" costs approximately $50 per child to reward them with their own skateboard, helmet, and Getaboard tee shirt. Additional expenses are food, snacks, water and transportation costs needed each week to provide skate lessons.</p>
<p>If we are unable to reach our goal of impacting the lives of 250 kids through our fundraising efforts or even if we surpass our goal, we will adjust our program to reach the maximum amount of children we are able to serve by $50 increments.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By requiring that each children earn their Getaboard ""Board Award"" by taking our Life Target Test and passing our six week skateboarding program, Getaboard:</p>
<ul>
<li>Builds the value of the gift in each child's mind</li>
<li>Teaches them to set goals and work hard for things they desire</li>
<li>Allows them to label themselves as something other than homeless- they are now a skateboarder or an artist</li>
<li>Plants a seed of hope in each child's heart for a brighter future beyond their current circumstances of being homeless</li>
</ul><p>If we can help each of these 250 homeless children in 2013 aspire to at least graduate high school and possibly have a vision of a future career, we will not only be helping to breaking the cycle of financial heartache in their family, but helping ease the potential negative financial impact on society by approximately $85,000,000.00- All by helping this small group of children through skateboarding.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you're not an Anberlin fan (then something's wrong with you, cuz they rock!) you can still help Getaboard impact the lives of these most deserving of under privileged youth by doing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Helping us get the word out about what we do, to people you know who surf, skate, create or who love helping kids or the future of our country, in general.</li>
<li>Join us on Facebook and hopefully ""LIKE US"" to find out about other Indiegogo campaigns and cool fundraisers we will be conducting in the near      future with plenty of swag and goodies for all.

In such desperate times, providing quality, engaging activities and solid role models has never been of greater importance to our youth and our country. A recent CBS 60 MINUTES Special, Hard Times Generation, stated Florida has the third largest homeless population in the United States and growing. There are over 10,000 homeless children living in central Florida, alone.
 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs5--QZ98Fk
This scenario combined with a recent report from Psychology Today's Teen Angst segment stating that homeless youth are 50% more likely than average students to drop out of high school due to unstable home lives, potential domestic violence and food scarcity creates a looming concern. Each high school drop-out costs our society $340,000.00 over their lifetime, due to their dependence on housing, food, and medical care. Also, 82% of all prisoners incarcerated in America, today, are high school dropouts.
We can see the problem. So let's work on the solution and break the cycle!
For the past 2 years the Getaboard Foundation has been working with the Coalition for the Homeless, providing our Getaboard Skateboarding program which helps homeless children, going through a turbulent time in their lives, learn how to properly skateboard and do art in exchange for taking our Life Target Test. This simple test, helps these kids discover a career that best fits their personality type while planting a seed of hope and a positive self image of themselves to carry into the future. A child with a dream can overcome any obstacle.
Our Getaboard Skateboarding program offers our students a chance to:

Use quality skateboards, safety gear and equipment
Be instructed by knowledgeable, pre-screened, volunteer skateboarding and art instructors
Build self esteem and a positive self image through newly acquired skills and a new found sense of self awareness
At the end of each six week session, during our Getaboard Board Awards, each child is rewarded their own skateboard, helmet and Getaboard tee shirt for passing our program.
Our goal is to positively impact the lives of over 250 homeless children through our Getaboard Skateboarding program in 2013. Each child's ""Board Award"" costs approximately $50 per child to reward them with their own skateboard, helmet, and Getaboard tee shirt. Additional expenses are food, snacks, water and transportation costs needed each week to provide skate lessons.
If we are unable to reach our goal of impacting the lives of 250 kids through our fundraising efforts or even if we surpass our goal, we will adjust our program to reach the maximum amount of children we are able to serve by $50 increments.
The Impact
By requiring that each children earn their Getaboard ""Board Award"" by taking our Life Target Test and passing our six week skateboarding program, Getaboard:

Builds the value of the gift in each child's mind
Teaches them to set goals and work hard for things they desire
Allows them to label themselves as something other than homeless- they are now a skateboarder or an artist
Plants a seed of hope in each child's heart for a brighter future beyond their current circumstances of being homeless
If we can help each of these 250 homeless children in 2013 aspire to at least graduate high school and possibly have a vision of a future career, we will not only be helping to breaking the cycle of financial heartache in their family, but helping ease the potential negative financial impact on society by approximately $85,000,000.00- All by helping this small group of children through skateboarding.
Other Ways You Can Help
If you're not an Anberlin fan (then something's wrong with you, cuz they rock!) you can still help Getaboard impact the lives of these most deserving of under privileged youth by doing the following:

Helping us get the word out about what we do, to people you know who surf, skate, create or who love helping kids or the future of our country, in general.
Join us on Facebook and hopefully ""LIKE US"" to find out about other Indiegogo campaigns and cool fundraisers we will be conducting in the near      future with plenty of swag and goodies for all. Go to: www.facebook.com/getaboardkids

Blast this particular campaign out to all your homies who hopefully also love Anberlin and would love to enter to win a super sick Epiphone one-of-a-kind Anberlin Signed Guitar and get a gnarly Getaboard T-shirt for their effort!

<p><strong><em>                 <br/></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>                                 Help Turn My Pain into POWER!</em></strong></p>
<p>Please help me get Howwee home and complete the HEAL Center.</p>
<p>I need your help to turn my pain into Power.</p>
<p>Hello my name is Aleah Holland known to thousand as Miss HEAL. I'm 9 months pregnant. I'm a registered nurse for 15 years. I am also the founder of HEAL Network Inc, a  youth organization that provides free services to seniors and create programs for underprivileged youth to keep them off them safe and off the streets. These programs were funded entirely from my savings and my salary as a nurse. We receive mostly product and service donations. I recently put all my money in a Headquarters for HEAL Network Inc. as we were getting kicked out, and bounced all around when we borrowed, and even rented spaces in the schools we serviced. I did not know what happened to me would ever happen</p>
<p><strong><em>Miss HEAL WILL BE ARRESTED</em></strong><em>!</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>August 15, 2012  I had my youngest child stolen away from me. My child was stolen by a ruthless, corrupt domestic violence judge. She gave full custody to my abuser and <strong><em>if I contact my son I WILL BE ARRESTED</em></strong><em>!</em></p>
<p><em>I left my abuser/batter in 2009. At a custody exchange on Christmas 2010 he attacked me. </em></p>
<p><em>I entered Domestic violence court after being attacked again. </em></p>
<p><em>I thought in domestic violence court I was <strong>SAFE</strong></em></p>
<p><strong><em>Guns, Drugs, violence, Abuse is okay- That is what judge and children lawyer say.</em></strong></p>
<p>I complained about the guns, abuse, drug use, uncommon sense, endangering the life of my children, using my child to drain taxpayers for a case that was simple, but has carried on for almost 3 years.</p>
<p>After that this judge had no problems proving me right. That she had it out for me.  Genevieve the children's lawyer from the children Law Center allowed my child to be burned, guns pulled out around him, drug use, abuse, and has not done one thing to protect him. She has endangered the life of my child as well. She should never be allowed to practice law especially as a child attorney.</p>
<p><strong><em>I have been prevented from protecting my child.</em></strong></p>
<p>December 12, 2012: judge states she does not care if I lose my job. 1st time since 2009 abuser is ever drug tested. I give an audio of 12 year old reporting guns, drugs and violence at abusers home.</p>
<p>December 22, 2012,: Son is stolen away from me after I give an audio of 12 year old reporting guns, drugs and violence at abusers home. Son is stolen away while my daughter and friends watch in horror.</p>
<p><strong><em>Genevieve child's lawyer states she feel the 3 year old is more credible when he say mommy plays with guns and not the 12 year old</em></strong><em> who reported the incident. She allows my son to be turned over to the abuser who tested positive for illegal drugs and alcohol that same day.</em></p>
<p><em>January 2012: </em></p>
<p><em>1. I am interviewed by Brooklyn News 12 but story not aired-they said due to the courts being closed they can not verify my story.</em></p>
<p><em>2. I file a judicial complaint and many other complaints</em></p>
<p><em>January 5, 2012: my son is given back to me.</em></p>
<p><em>February 2012:  court date postponed, </em></p>
<p><em>March 2012 : court date postponed.</em></p>
<p>April 18, 2012: After losing job due to the biweekly court dates I am denied legal counsel.</p>
<p>Judge is rude and condescending. Judge repeats something I wrote on Twitter. ""She is following me on twitter""</p>
<p>May 9,2012: Denied legal counsel again, and after ABUSER is testing positive EVERY DAY for ILLEGAL DRUGS and ALCOHOL judge reduces testing from daily testing to RANDOM-Testing which turns out to be NOT AT ALL. even after I state my child LIFE is being endangered when he is high and drunk.</p>

He creates a fake story and judge files numerous false charges against me; Unbeknownst to me while I was in the hospital having a possible miscarriage; She switch the ABUSER court case for attacking the children from CRIMINAL COURT and places in her court.-where it does not belong.</p>
<p>August 6, 2012: She put a warrant out for my arrest after holding another secret hearing</p>
<p>August 15, 2012 notified by daycare owner there is a warrant for my arrest and that I lost all contact with my child.</p>

<p><strong>Please Ask judge Morgenstern why she stole my son away from me?</strong></p>
<p>This judge has put my son safety, sanity, and security at risk. He has been placed in a home where he has had guns pulled out and his life threatened. She placed him where there is drug use, drug selling and drug buying.</p>
<p><strong>My Abuser was given Full custody. I have NO CONTACTN AT ALL.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The judge gave Full custody to an unemployed, illegal drug addicted/ alcoholic with a current criminal case for child abuse; He has no residence of his own. He attacked and assaulted my 15 year old daughter on June 27, 2012 while she held her brother. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The judge removed his case out of criminal court and put it in her court where it does not belong. </strong></p>
<p><strong>She dismissed his charges of abuse against me and my children in the past. This abuser has been unemployed from 2007 and does not pay child support for any of his children. This violation has caused my 16 year old daughter to bedepressed. She's getting counseling.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I NEVER THOUGHT THIS WOULD HAPPEN TO ME</strong></p>
<p>Before this attack on my life I put my life savings in a location for HEAL Network. I was making 2-3k weekly as a nurse. (I<strong> will send Paystubs upon request</strong>) I never expected this would happen in a domestic violence court.</p>

<p>ALL money will go to the Turning Pain into Power project. This is The HEAL Seniors program first and Video-Blogging second because this judge plays a lot of evil, ruthless tricks and games. She crushes lawyers with her illegal tactics. She has done this to numerous families, and lawyers. Few victims in her court room have spent over $25,000 to $98,000.00 and still have been prevented being with their child or  from having a normal relationship with their child.</p>
<p>$5000 to fully complete the HEAL Senior's project. I started a HEAL Seniors program that was to launch this winter.  We provide free cleaning, cooking, errand services and meals to seniors at home alone. We provide transportation and meals to our interns and volunteers to provide these free services. The space also needs sprucing up, painting, and minor renovations. This is where we orientate the interns and sign up the seniors.</p>
<p><strong>$1000 I need to buy video supplies to video-blog to get Howwee home and </strong>denouncing judicial corruption. I want to continue to tell my story as hundreds of thousands of families are going through these same situations.</p>

Few victims in her court room have spent over $25,000 to $98,000.00 and still have been prevented being with their child or  from having a normal relationship with their child.
$5000 to fully complete the HEAL Senior's project. I started a HEAL Seniors program that was to launch this winter.  We provide free cleaning, cooking, errand services and meals to seniors at home alone. We provide transportation and meals to our interns and volunteers to provide these free services. The space also needs sprucing up, painting, and minor renovations. This is where we orientate the interns and sign up the seniors.
$1000 I need to buy video supplies to video-blog to get Howwee home and denouncing judicial corruption. I want to continue to tell my story as hundreds of thousands of families are going through these same situations.
$3500/for a lawyer unless one will help me for free-
$-Just sign my petiton and please help me fight back
Thank You
Other Ways You Can Help get Howwee Home and save HEAL Seniors program.

I know some people can’t contribute financially, but you are definitely helping: •    Even if you can't afford a cent, asking the media to cover this story, signing my petition, Tweeting or making some noise about my campaign means a lot to me.
 Please sign my petition:http://www.change.org/petitions/judge-esther-mo... Please share my story. There are ruthless judges all over America.

<p><strong>The English language industry is behind the times. There just isn’t enough content out there that will help Spanish speakers to learn English in an engaging and creative way. Dynamic English Lessons will change that. It is a unique platform containing English learning materials that are interesting and exciting. Best of all, membership will be highly affordable, setting it apart from other courses, which often charge many hundreds of dollars.</strong></p>
<h2><strong><em><span style=""color: #ff0000;"">MY INSPIRATION</span></em> </strong></h2>
<p><strong>My name is Nadia Bentoua. When I was at school I became addicted to drugs and alcohol, and I was expelled from school with no qualifications and no prospects. The next 10 years of my life were very tough, but finally I was lucky enough to get help and – most importantly – get an education. I am now 33 and I live in Australia; I have been an English language teacher for about 10 years. My life experiences have shown me just how essential an education is for everyone, and this knowledge is what has inspired me to create Dynamic English Lessons.</strong></p>
<h2><em><strong><span style=""color: #ff0000;"">WHAT IS SO BENEFICIAL ABOUT THIS PRODUCT?</span></strong></em></h2>
<p><strong>Dynamic English Lessons will be a unique course. A lifetime fee will cost just $49, and this will give the user lifetime access to all learning materials. I want as many people in the Americas as possible to have access to high-quality English language education. There is nothing like Dynamic English Lessons currently available. We will teach English in a natural way; there will be no scripts and all lessons will be recorded at a natural speaking pace. English will be taught in real-life situations so all learners can be ready to hold actual conversations in English as soon as possible.</strong></p>
<h2><em><strong><span style=""color: #ff0000;"">WHO WILL BENEFIT?</span></strong></em></h2>
<p><strong>There are so many people in the Americas who want and need to learn English, especially because of the upcoming Olympic Games. Dynamic English Lessons will give them this great opportunity. Furthermore, half of the company profits will be donated back into needy communities in the Americas. For example, if 1,000 people from Colombia sign up, half of the profits will be invested back into Colombia, providing important resources such as classroom equipment or teaching costs. I plan to travel to Latin American countries myself to see where and how the money can best be used, in order to make sure it has the maximum benefit for the communities. But to do this, I need your help.</strong></p>
<h2><em><strong><span style=""color: #ff0000;"">WHERE YOUR MONEY WILL GO</span></strong></em></h2>
<p><strong>I really need to raise funds in order to launch a publicity campaign throughout Spain and the Americas to raise awareness of the company. Such campaigns are very expensive. I need to pay for advertising in major newspapers, on websites and blogs, as well as to cover other marketing costs. With the right marketing, we can do so many good things and help so many people. We just need the right funding.</strong></p>
<h2><em><strong><span style=""color: #ff0000;"">THE IMPACT</span></strong></em></h2>
<p><strong>You will be helping to make a real difference in the lives of not just Spanish speakers who want to learn English, but also impoverished and underprivileged communities right through the Americas. You will be helping Latin American children gain access to a proper education, with the needed resources. This project means a lot to me, both because I want to help people to get an education and because I have great concern for so many disadvantaged Latin American communities.

<p><em>       “Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.” Mahatma Ghandi</em></p>
<p>This is an important moment in my life where I have started to question my contribution to the world as well as my impact within it. </p>
<p>I have been very fortunate to be offered a place to study <a href=""http://www.schumachercollege.org.uk/courses/msc-holistic-science"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MSc in Holistic Science</a> at <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG50IJNmqAs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>Schumacher College</strong></a> in the beautiful countryside of Devon, UK, where I have been volunteering for the past 2 months.</p>
<p>This campaign is not only helping me fund my tuition fess, but also begins a process of looking at the way in which gift economy can promote a gift education in which we share our skills, knowledge and means in order to empower others.</p>
<p>I want to pay your support forward after my graduation, by offering 100 hours of free documentary photography workshops to people who would struggle to afford them otherwise.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>About me and Schumacher College</h3>
<p>I am 23, I come from Romania and I am a documentary photographer, passionate about dance, theatre and storytelling as means of self-knowledge and empowerment.</p>
<p>The people that I have <a href=""http://www.deliaspatareanu.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">photographed</a> and the different experiences I've been faced with have inspired me to rethink my work and to open dialogues on environmental and social justice.</p>
<p>Schumacher College is a place to re-evaluate our scientific understanding of nature and our role in a moment of ecological, economic and social change. </p>
<p>The course combines many areas of interest for me, to an extent which I am sure will create many synergies within my thinking and current artistic practice as a documentary photographer. </p>
<p>This year is a great opportunity to reflect on my work and to develop as an actively engaged human being. I believe in a rounded practice that involves head, heart and hands. Research, intuition and practice!</p>
<p>The 2 months of volunteering at the College have offered me a glimpse into a learning environment which is gentle, supportive and generous. I feel this model should be at the heart of any education.</p>
<p>I am deeply moved by the numbers of people that leave this place motivated and enthusiastic to make a change in their lives and communities towards wellbeing. </p>
<p>That is why I decided to create a <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/video/2012/jul/30/charles-eisenstein-gift-economy"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">gift economy scheme</a> in order to attend this unique course and immerse in a deep exploration of our Nature and ourselves. </p>

</h3>
<p>The cost of tuition fees and accomodation for the academic year is approximately £19 500, out of which I still need to raise approximately £10 000 until the beginning of the programme in September 2013. </p>
<p>When I was promised my first £100, something really shifted in me. I have realised that this is not my project, but a collective one. I became a catalyst for conversations, ideas and initiatives towards a different economy and education. </p>
<p>I want to share my learning throught the master throught termly newsletters, articles, essay about innovative ways of being independent, sustainable and responsable. I will also open a forum of discussion with quaterly topics where I invite you to share amongst each other.</p>
<p>After graduation I will offer 100 hours of free workshops that will combine arts and science, my photography training and the wonderful insights of the MSc Holistic Science. </p>

<h3><strong><span>Why <em>pay it back</em>, when you can <em>pay it forward</em>?</span></strong></h3>
<p>Sharing our knowledge and skills is one of the most valuable things we can offer to our society. Being able to ASK, to GIVE and to RECEIVE allows us to help and trust each other, to build responsible relationships in our communities. </p>
<p>I want this initative to go beyond my degreee and to be the start of a snowball effect where gift education can be developed in a new model of funding education.

<h2><span>Why now? Why this?</span></h2>
<p><span>T</span>oday, the world is more connected than ever before. Yet as we grow closer, we have seen a rise in disputes over land, money, natural resources, culture, and religion. These conflicts have a direct impact on all of our lives, affecting us personally, and professionally — in our families, communities, and businesses. In order to create a more peaceful future — one that nurtures global understanding and compassion, while eliminating strife and alienation — it is vital to support the next generation of leaders in honing their voices and visions.</p>
<p>We believe that peaceful negotiation, global leadership, and ethical culture is best learned through hands-on experience in the natural world around us. By providing adolescents the opportunity to explore our ecosystem, the science of agriculture, and theater art, campers are able to shed previously held stereotypes and gain valuable knowledge about social, political, economic, and global relations.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>How it all goes down.</strong></h2>
<p>Camp is based at The Vallarta Botanical Gardens, in conjunction with the University of Guadalajara, in the mountains of Jalisco, Mexico. Local teenagers, from a variety of economic backgrounds, travel to the gardens five days a week for seven hours per day. The camp community will prepare, serve, and eat lunch and snacks together, therefore eliminating any economic or professional stereotypes.</p>
<p><span><strong>MORNING CAMP ACTIVITIES INCLUDE:</strong></span></p>
<p>Discovery activities about the rich local ecosystem and animal species</p>
<p>Special workshops led by science specialists on their fields - such as jagars, bugs, and fish printing</p>
<p>Fun activities about recycling and the importance of conservation</p>
<p>Exploring the agricultural methods employed by the gardens</p>
<p>Hiking through the mountain trails</p>
<p>Swimming in the river</p>
<p><strong>AFTERNOON CAMP ACTIVITIES INCLUDE:</strong></p>
<p>Fun theater games that promote leadership and community</p>
<p>Group discussion and structured debate about campers’ communal and global responsibility</p>
<p>Improvisation exercises centered on the morning science lessons</p>
<p>Writing and improv activities centered on the creation of an original play</p>
<p>The camp session concludes with an original theatrical presentation, completely written, designed, directed, and performed by the campers. The theater piece will be based on the explorations, improvisations, writing exercises, and group discussions which occurred over the previous four weeks. This presentation will be performed at The Vallarta Botanical Gardens, for friends, families, and the garden patrons.</p>
<p>Terra Firma Summer Camp is led by a group of dynamic, professionals in the fields of theater and science. These teachers come together to share their knowledge and help lead campers in the pursuit of their own discoveries. Faculty includes:</p>

She has worked at Dalton, as a Seventh grade English teacher and a Sixth grade Theater teacher.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><i>Hello
everybody, my name is Georgette Habashi, from the most exciting
city in the world: Jerusalem.  I hold a B.A. degree from
Bethlehem University in Business Administration (1989) and have worked for a variety of international non-governmental organizations including World
Vision and EU projects. I am currently working at the Friedrich Naumman Foundation. Beside all of this, I
hold different positions in local non-governmental organizations on their boards
of administration.  Volunteer work is a way of life.  </i></p>
<p><b><i>Hot in summer ,  VERY cold in winter.  This is the weather
in Palestine.</i></b></p>
<p>Blankets are essential in winter since heating is very expensive or not available. It is considered  a luxury if one has more than two for him or herself.
 Palestinian families often share a blanket and some
families don't even have them!!!  Needy families will appreciate a blanket as Christmas gift and won't see it as 'charity'. It will definitely add a to the holiday cheer, put a smile to their faces, and keep them warm! <br/></p>
<p>Together,  we can do this. We are planning to assist between 300-500  families in Palestine by distributing the blankets to the urban areas,
villages and refugee camps. North, south and middle of Palestine will be
treated equally.  If your help and support exceeds what we have asked for, then more families will be added to the list. <br/></p>
<p>How will we do this? <br/></p>
<p>The first step is identifying and selecting the Palestinian families O<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">ur friendly local charitable humanitarian
organizations and clubs will be informed about the work and they will help provide a list of needy families. <br/></span></p>
<p>Then, different suppliers will be called to collect prices
for blankets. The supplier with the most t economic price with a good quality blanket will be chosen.
A good quality blanket will last for at least three years. <br/></p>
<p>Lastly, we will <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">secure transportation to deliver the blankets on time.   <br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Everyone knows about the political situation in Palestine, s</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">uch a situation is beyond our control.  Yet caring, loving, giving and being human is within our capacity and one of the ways to show that is to work on securing the basic of needs of families who need support. Blankets in winter is basic, but as the Arabic saying goes, ""o</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">ne hand cannot </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">clap""</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> .

Hello
everybody, my name is Georgette Habashi, from the most exciting
city in the world: Jerusalem.  I hold a B.A. degree from
Bethlehem University in Business Administration (1989) and have worked for a variety of international non-governmental organizations including World
Vision and EU projects. I am currently working at the Friedrich Naumman Foundation. Beside all of this, I
hold different positions in local non-governmental organizations on their boards
of administration.  Volunteer work is a way of life.  
Hot in summer ,  VERY cold in winter.  This is the weather
in Palestine.
Blankets are essential in winter since heating is very expensive or not available. It is considered  a luxury if one has more than two for him or herself.
 Palestinian families often share a blanket and some
families don't even have them!!!  Needy families will appreciate a blanket as Christmas gift and won't see it as 'charity'. It will definitely add a to the holiday cheer, put a smile to their faces, and keep them warm! 
Together,  we can do this. We are planning to assist between 300-500  families in Palestine by distributing the blankets to the urban areas,
villages and refugee camps. North, south and middle of Palestine will be
treated equally.  If your help and support exceeds what we have asked for, then more families will be added to the list. 
How will we do this? 
The first step is identifying and selecting the Palestinian families Our friendly local charitable humanitarian
organizations and clubs will be informed about the work and they will help provide a list of needy families. 
Then, different suppliers will be called to collect prices
for blankets. The supplier with the most t economic price with a good quality blanket will be chosen.
A good quality blanket will last for at least three years. 
Lastly, we will secure transportation to deliver the blankets on time.   
Everyone knows about the political situation in Palestine, such a situation is beyond our control.  Yet caring, loving, giving and being human is within our capacity and one of the ways to show that is to work on securing the basic of needs of families who need support. Blankets in winter is basic, but as the Arabic saying goes, ""one hand cannot clap"" . We cannot do it without YOU. Your support and giving spirit is what we need and is the essential element to achieve to keep those needy families warm, healthy and add a smile and happiness during Christmas time.  
What We Need & What You Get

Our target to assist families is between 300- 500 families.  The flexibility depends on the spirit of giving.  But the plan goes like this:
For the blankets, with $15000, we will be able to purchase 500 blankets and help 500 families. Each family will get one blanket. $30/blanket * 500 blanket = $15000 
Transportation costs are $1000 to three different areas in Palestine.

Our goal is $15000 ($15000 for blankets + $1000 for transportation = $16000).
If we exceed our goal (and we hope this will happen!), we will use the money to buy more blankets and add more families to benefit from the ""Christmas Gift"" 
If we don't reach the amount called for, we will be sadly forced to reduce the number of families who will not have the opportunity to enjoy the ""Christmas Gift.
Communication fees such a telephone bill and fax will be from our own pockets.
Why do we have a perk for the giving amount of $30+ and do we mean to have it like this? The answer is simply YES.  The amount will allow for one blanket for one family to be purchased and anything extra will be contributed to the cost for the transportation or will be gathered with the 'extra' contributions to buy another blanket for another family. 
Our perks are unique and also special.  Our perks are not commercial stuff but have  elements of art and design.  Most of our perks are handmade and reflect the Palestinian culture and heritage. We hope that our perks show our appreciation for our helpers and supporters.

<h3>The Nayari Language Project</h3>
<p>Get passionate about our project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Imagine never having a book in your language. Imagine that any library you entered was written in a foreign tongue, and you had never seen your own language in print.</li>
<li>Currently, there are no facilities for adults or families in the Nayari homelands or anywhere else which are devoted to Nayari language or to learning Nayari language or culture. As a result of Spanish dominated education, Nayari has remained an unread oral language in spite of the lexicon, dictionary and alphabet which was created in 1984.</li>
<li>I am a graduate student in the field of adult learning and I want to meet the need in the Nayari community for literacy in their native tongue. My mother, who began learning to speak Nayari when she was working with my father on the lexicon and dictionary in the 1980's, is developing a program to teach reading in the native language. Yet, new Nayari readers have little reading material on which to practice. The dream of our family has been to help this gentle community participate in the global society while maintaining their cultural heritage and identity. We, and many of the Nayari who we work with, believe that the key to cultural identity is through preserving their beautiful Uto-Aztecan language.</li>
<li>The Nayari Language Project is part of our plan to create a community library and reading room in the municipal capital of the Nayari people. The library will be created by the Nayari for their own use and to preserve their unique cultural memory. It will become an educational space where cultural knowledge transmission can take place, linking oral traditions of the past to modern modes of learning through books and texts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ask yourself, do you value cultural diversity in a global society? Don't you want to ensure that the unique knoweldge and languages of minority indigenous communities are retained for future generations?</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This is a long term community based project:</p>
<p>Our plan is to create a sustainable community led library and reading room within the Nayari muncipal capital of Jesus Maria. All materials will be in the native language and be culturally specific; they will be authored by the Nayari people.</p>
<p>Nayari history and culture is fascinating! Folklore and mythology explain the toads which bring the rains, the clouds which represent our ancestors and the heroic stance of the Nayari as they fought against colonial invaders. Hopefully, these wonderful stories will someday be available in many languages, but wouldn't it make sense for them to be made available first to the people who authored them?</p>
<p>We estimate the beginning needs of our project to be $12,500. This is to start up the reading room through capacity building activities (teaching and creation of books) and create a sustainable plan to keep it going.</p>
<p>Funds from the project will first be applied to pay for non-profit, tax exempt status. This enables us to give generous donors like you a tax deduction for helping us! Tax exempt status costs $500.</p>
<p>Then, funds will help us to create initial texts (books) which will be used for language learning and reading classes. They will form the beginning of the library collection. The books currently in progress are folklore related to the worldview of the Naayari people to be used for teaching literacy.  We pay out of pocket for publishing.</p>
<p>Our funding goal will also pay for class materials to teach reading and writing to a cohort of twelve, with the expectation that new readers and writers will contribute to the maintenance of the reading room by reading to children, teaching other reading classes, or writing books in Nayari to become part of the community collection. Class materials include supplies such as pencils and paper as well as individual copies of the primers (books).</p>
<p>Additional funding over our goal will enable us to establish a location for the library and reading room within the township. Until then, classes will be held wherever possible (usually people's homes). The library will temporarily be housed in a private home, but will be accessible to all.</p>
<p>We hope to grow this project to become a fully operational library and literacy center. We understand that the process of creating a community based center is a long term commitment and may take many years; with generous donors such as you, we can make the dream a reality much sooner!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will have a long term and dramatic impact on an underserved indigenous community:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our world consists of a multitude of communities, each with unique cultural and linguistic paradigms. Local needs must be balanced with the constant global pressures of progress and advancement.We believe that every community can learn from other communities to create a diverse mosiac.</li>
<li>Our Nayari community is situated on a precipice; the ""shift"" generation is being taught Spanish and forgetting their native traditions, values and heritage. Nayari people fear the loss of their language and culture due to the pressures of the outside world. At the same time, they seek education and advancement. We are dedicated to serving both of these needs.</li>
<li>We realize our responsibility to the donor community, and seek to create accountability measures to ensure that your funding is impacting the Nayari community. As part of my graduate work, I have devised a long term evaluation strategy which will allow us to revise, optimize and scale up our reading classes and the creation of the library. We want to increase language and cultural literacy in the Nayari community and are dedicated to making sure that we are engaged in the most meaningful way to do so.</li>
<li>We will develop a web presence through social media, allowing our donor community the opportunity to see our work in action.</li>
<li>We will maintain an open and honest relationship with our Nayari friends and partners to ensure transformational validity and congruence with the needs of the community.</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Evan Bass and I've been a middle and high school teacher for over 10 years.    I have always taught in high needs public school because I believe that all students have a right to a quality education, and I've always wanted to give back to the community in a lasting way.  My campaign is about bringing the internet into my classroom in a tangible, integrated way.  I can support my students and plan my daily lessons in an entirely new, innovative, more individualized and data driven fashion if I can count on the use of laptops each day, and the only way for this to happen is for me to have my own class set.  Technology is a very powerful tool, that is often inaccessible or spread too thin in education.  Anyone who knows me, knows that I love technology, and I know that the possibilities are endless as to the ways that I can tailor my classroom to get the most out of each of my students and set them up to have the best math experience that they have ever had in their lives.  This would be something that I've never seen before in a class, and I am fully committed toward making this dream a reality for myself and my students moving forward.  </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What I need is very simple.  I would ideally like to purchase 25 Chromebook laptops.  Each Chromebook costs about $240.00.  I ultimately need closer to $6000 but I realize that people can donate more than my asking cost.  Any money that is raised will go towards the purchase of Chromebooks, even if I do not reach my entire goal.  </p>
<p>There will be a couple of perks for supporting this project.  </p>
<p>1.  If you donate 50 or more dollars, you will recieve a handwritten letter from one of my students explaining to you how these laptops have affected them in class this year.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.  If you donate 100 or more dollars, you will recieve a letter from a student, and a short movie that I will create, documenting the ways in which we are utilizing the Chromebooks in our classroom.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>

</div></div>","Short Summary
My name is Evan Bass and I've been a middle and high school teacher for over 10 years.    I have always taught in high needs public school because I believe that all students have a right to a quality education, and I've always wanted to give back to the community in a lasting way.  My campaign is about bringing the internet into my classroom in a tangible, integrated way.  I can support my students and plan my daily lessons in an entirely new, innovative, more individualized and data driven fashion if I can count on the use of laptops each day, and the only way for this to happen is for me to have my own class set.  Technology is a very powerful tool, that is often inaccessible or spread too thin in education.  Anyone who knows me, knows that I love technology, and I know that the possibilities are endless as to the ways that I can tailor my classroom to get the most out of each of my students and set them up to have the best math experience that they have ever had in their lives.  This would be something that I've never seen before in a class, and I am fully committed toward making this dream a reality for myself and my students moving forward.  
 


What We Need & What You Get
What I need is very simple.  I would ideally like to purchase 25 Chromebook laptops.  Each Chromebook costs about $240.00.  I ultimately need closer to $6000 but I realize that people can donate more than my asking cost.  Any money that is raised will go towards the purchase of Chromebooks, even if I do not reach my entire goal.  
There will be a couple of perks for supporting this project.  
1.  If you donate 50 or more dollars, you will recieve a handwritten letter from one of my students explaining to you how these laptops have affected them in class this year.
 
2.  If you donate 100 or more dollars, you will recieve a letter from a student, and a short movie that I will create, documenting the ways in which we are utilizing the Chromebooks in our classroom.

<h3>HI! You may not know me, but...</h3>
<p>...my name is Rebecca Gibson, and in May (yay!) I'll be graduating from Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts, with a MA in Women's Studies and Anthropology.  I'm in the process of PhD applications (not quite so yay...) and am quite hopeful that I will be getting into one of the seven to which I applied.  However, only two of them are in the Boston area, which means that for any of the other five, I'll have to move.</p>
<p>Hence, this indiegogo campaign.  I'm living off student loans (really not at all yay.)  And in the summer, between semesters, those loans turn into a pumpkin, and I will be out of money.  Completely.  Kaput.  Of course, I'll be looking for a job.  Of course.  But, seriously, how many three month, well paying positions are there for someone transitioning to a new location on short notice? </p>
<p>So, here's the thing: Richard Nixon got a full ride to Harvard, but couldn't afford the train ticket to get there.  I don't want to end up bitter and angry like Nixon, thus prolonging the Vietnam war, now do I?  By contributing to this campaign, you will ensure that I can hire a moving truck, pay for gas, eat all through the summer, and not turn out to become a bad president.  Or even a bad physical anthropolgist, because I'm pretty good at what I do. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong>For this campaign, I am targeting a goal of $5000.  This would be enough to feed, house, and transport me for the summer, and to establish myself in a new city.  Furthermore, on the (almost anti-yay) possibility that I do not get into any of my selected PhD programs, this would make me able to stay in my current apartment while I job search in the Boston area. </p>
<p>And you'll get cool perks!  I'm a published poet--for donations between $1 and $10, you will get a personalized poem.  Smaller donations will get the poem e-mailed to you, while larger ones will be hand written and mailed.  You request the topic, I will write poetry about it, just for you!</p>
<p>Donations between $11 and $25 will get a poem and a watercolored picture, also on a topic of your choice.</p>
<p>Donations between $25 and $100 will get your choice of a poem OR a picture, and freshly baked cookies. </p>
<p>Donations over $100 will get your choice of a poem or a picture, and a souvenir from my new university.</p>
</div>
<div>If my $5000 goal isn't reached, whatever funding I do recieve will be put toward moving.  All donors will receive their perks whether the goal is reached or not. </div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Why do I want to get into a PhD program so badly, you might ask?  My current research is super cool!  I am looking at the physical and social effects of corseting during the Victorian period, in England and France.  This research will make a valuable contribution to the scholarship about Victorian women, and it has taken me to London and Bath in the UK, and Paris and Lyon in France.  I really love my work, I am absolutely a born anthropologist and scholar, and I need to continue. </p>

...you can boost the signal!  Share on facebook, tweet your heart's out, tell your friends, write it (in chalk, 'k peeps?) on the walls, to get this seen by more and more people!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>I'm Marie Inzinna and I want to tell you about my friend and business partner, Kerrilee Hunter. She was a teacher in the preschool where I was assistant director, and after working together for three years, decided to open our own school! Thus the idea for <a href=""http://www.jenscommunityatwildcliff.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Jen's Community at Wildcliff</span></a> (JCW) was born. It's a project that brings together three things I know Kerrilee loves: food, early childhood education, and travel. She's been working hard on the first two, now it's time for the third piece to have a turn during a research trip to Scotland &amp; Scandinavia!</p>
<p><strong>A Research Mission</strong></p>
<p>Part of our mission at JCW is to connect globally to like-minded folks who support progressive education and self-awareness in the world. In September, Kerrilee will be visiting Scotland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Iceland to meet with early childhood teachers and community builders… visiting schools, conducting interviews, and spending time with people where the values of our mission are thriving. She will document and share her journey along the way, keeping everyone involved before, during, and after the trip itself!</p>
<p>She has set a goal of $5,000 to cover travel costs &amp; the fees for IndieGoGo and credit card processing. You can see a breakdown of the budget for her trip <a href=""http://www.budgetyourtrip.com/mytripoverview.php?trip_id=11200&amp;key=v48su8LLY2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>here</span></a>.</p>
<p>She's also put together some perks to go along with it; take a look to the right for some fun rewards! You can receive a postcard from abroad as well as a personalized photo book or even a Skype chat.</p>
<p>The campaign ends the day before our 2nd annual Harvest Festival… anything over the goal goes directly to JCW for this event!</p>
<p><strong>What It Means</strong></p>
<p>Opening people up to more engaged ways of living is something Kerrilee does, and does well; this will give her more tools in her tool belt to help those around her do just that. She's already created contacts in the region through the <a href=""http://www.slc.edu/cdi/professional-development/conferences/nordic-perspectives-symposium.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span><em>Nordic Perspectives on Caring and Teaching in Early Childhood:  Implications for Success in School</em></span></a><em> </em>conference she attended, run a <a href=""http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/762626366/wildcliff-gets-its-first-garden"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>successful campaign</span></a> for a gardening project at Wildcliff, and contributed to <a href=""http://www.jenscommunityatwildcliff.org/posts/category/events/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">events</a> we've hosted on the grounds and elsewhere… and this is all just the beginning.</p>
<p>What Kerrilee does is go and come back--with ideas and ways to make them happen. With this trip, she will further the mission we've been working on at JCW by making connections with great educators of all stripes, and gathering ideas and practical steps we can take to make our vision a reality.</p>
<p>Any gift you give to Kerrilee is a gift that comes back to JCW and makes our whole community a better place. </p>

<h3>Hey All,</h3>
<div>      My name is Leroy Graham. I'm a 22 year old theater performer. I've been in the performing arts since the age of 14, but I can remember making up improve skits with my younger cousin since the age of 5. Performing is in my blood. It's the last thing I think about before I say my prayers at night and the first thing I think of when I wake. It's very important to me to have a solid technique and training. </div>
<div>       In having a solid technical base, I can increase my chances of being a working performer. Without this, I'm less likely of being employed as an actor. My two programs of interest are the ""<em><strong>American Conservatory Theater: Summer Congress 5 and 2 week sessions</strong></em>"" and ""<strong><em>Broadway Dance Center's 6 month intensive</em></strong>"". The total amount for both programs, including voice and singing lessons outside of these programs total to an amount of $10,000. My parents are trying their best to support me in this quest, but it's only so much that they can do. </div>
<div>      I've learnt to deal with not gaining the type of education that I would have liked because of financial issues. Being enrolled in an university and getting kicked out half way through my 1st semester because of financial issues, put into perspective that education is a terrible thing to waste. I'm tired of settling and I refuse to take no for an answer. This campaign not succeeding would just be another educational let for me and another disappointment to my parents.</div>
<div>      In addition to selling candy and initiating fund raising party events, I'm turning to the people of Indiegogo for help! Even if I do not reach my entire goal, the money that I do raise will still go to what I can pay for, like the voice and singing lessons. Even if you do not have money to donate, it would be greatly appreciated if you could get this story out to others. The more people that know about it, the greater the chance I'll have at obtaining my goal. The way I look at it is, if I could get at least 10,000 people to donate $1 each, I'll have my goal! So, lets get this show on the road by participating in getting the 1st act of this training on the go!</div>

<h2><strong>                          YJEP 2 AFRICA</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>This is a campaign to raise funds for 8 inner-city African Canadian young men to develop a documentary on their journey to Africa. </p>
<p>This documentary would highlight the story of the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade, share the connections between youth from Toronto’s inner city and their counterparts across the seas while showing how young men who were formally involved in the justice system can make a difference in the world they live in . It will inspire, educate and impact the lives of everyone who views it. </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What Would it look like </strong></p>
<p>The documentary would be a diary of the journey through the eyes of these  eight young men told from their own cultural experiences as well as their unique circumstances that has connected them to the motherland. </p>
<p>In it you would learn the stories of two of the men who are born Canadian with African roots which have not been firmly established and witness how they reconnect with family ties that have been lost. </p>
<p>Grow with three more as their take you through the historical routes that have been walked by ancestors as they were brought from the hinterlands of Africa to the Gold Coast and then forced on that trans-atlantic journey across the seas. </p>
<p>Finally witness all eight of them giving back and growing as men who previously viewed life in the context of justice system and now are empowered to help people who’s circumstances are different from their own. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why We Need Your Help</strong></p>
<p>In order for this film to be successful, we need your help to secure funding and mass promotion of this effort. The money raised will help go into the production cost of several things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Equipment Rentals (Flip Cameras and external memory Terabyte </li>
<li>Travel cost to include more memorable outside of Ghana, Nigeria, South Africa</li>
</ul>
<p>The expenses of an international trip add up quickly but will be well worth it as we bring this amazing life changing opportunity to film screen. Over the next few months we are going to be fundraising to make this trip a reality, host events, sponsorship hunting, social media advertising and every possible way we can make this a reality. Your contributions will go towards helping us reach this worthy goal to inspire change in the lives of everyone who watches the film.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Why You Should Help</strong></p>
<p>To help young men who have lost their way in life to find a greater purpose for living, for being focused and achieving their goals. </p>

<p>One of the many dreams is to be an ambassador for the United States of America in a foreign embassy. That is one of my dreams I have in government, and just one of the MANY dreams I have overall. Furthermore, the <strong>Girls Leadership Institute</strong> is a high quality program that can give me the skills to achieve the leadership skills I would need to achieve all my dreams. However, not only the skills, but the confidence to achieve them. A low self-esteem has been a weakness of mine in many points of my life, just like many girls. One of GLI's missions is to help girls with confidence, and they certainly achieved this mission for me in my first year of camp. The attitude the counselors have of being your authentic self and not being afraid to embarrass yourself or to take risks are certainly attributes you need as a leader. During camp at GLI we would have morning games. One game I remember went something like this; everyone would stand around in a large circle and one person would have to start making a sound or odd action towards another person. That person you made the action to would have to start repeating you and then after repeating the other person would have to make up their own weird ""routine"" towards another different person and then the cycle would just repeat. Well, I hated and dreaded that game with all my heart because trust me… you looked absolutely ridiculous and every eye was on you. However, what I learned from this game is that sometimes every eye will be on you and sometimes you have to do something righteously outrageous as a leader to gain followers. </p>
<h3> What Is The Girls Leadership Institute? </h3>
<p>   <strong>   <a href=""http://www.girlsleadershipinstitute.org/summer-camp"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">  The Girls Leadership Institute</a></strong> was co-founded by Rachel Simmons. Rachel has written four books about adolescent females. The Girls Leadership Institute mission is to teach, ""the practices of emotional intelligence, assertive self-expression and healthy relationships, giving girls the skills and confidence to live as leaders."" Girls Leadership Institute is a program designed to awaken girls to a life of ""authentic leadership"". Furthermore, GLI offers workshops for women of all ages, and summer camp for girls from sixth to twelfth grade. At GLI summer camp, the camp holds art intensives, workshops, a personal project, and the community of all females. In addition, their programs are specifically about developing girls’ “<em>internal</em>” leadership skills, and empowering the strength in young women to become effective, passionate leaders. Another neat thing GlI is known for is its ""Love Notes.""Love Notes are a nightly thing we do at camp where we write each girl a note that states something they excelled at that day or something we really like about them and their personality. The notes cannot be as simple as, ""I love your style!"" or ""I wish I had your hair."" They have to be authentic and real, just like a GLI girl.</p>
<h3>    What Is GLI Going To Do For Me And Why Do I Want To Go Back?</h3>
<p>As I stated before, being a leader and my dreams are very important to me. This year since I am a returning camper I will be in a program at GLI called ""Leadership for Life"" or ""L4L."" During this program, I will create a project, working in partnership with a local women’s or girls’ organization near South Hadly, supporting a vital cause. Which may even be beneficial for my college resume. This is certainly an amazing program for me because I want to make a difference now. Also, another dream of mine is to attend American University in Washington, DC, therefore college is very important to me and this program will be great for my college resume. You can check out some past girls projects here:<a href=""http://www.girlsleadershipinstitute.org/node/340"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> L4L</a>. I am really looking forward to the L4L program and what it can do for me in the future.  </p>
<p>Another reason why I want to go back, is that I honestly made amazing friends and met amazing women that are role models and mentors to me. Last year at GLI I did not expect to make such close friends. Now, when people where I live ask me who my best friends are, I always say, ""Well, most of them live in other states."" This usually sparks some confusion, but it is quite true. Going back to GLI will give me a chance to be with me greatest friends and even maybe meet some more. Furthermore, when  I think of what I want my life to be like when I am in my twenties I always think of my GLI counselors. They are honestly the coolest, wisest, and inspiring young women. They all come from different places and all have different jobs, but they all have been so many great places, are so confident in themselves, and have had great experiences. Each counselor at GLI can connect with any girl at GLI, and thats why I want to go back. I want to be surrounded my people who share the same dreams, values, and aspirations as I do. </p>
<h3><strong>What <em>I</em> Need And What<em> You</em> Get</strong></h3>
<p>       What<em> I</em> need is 2,200.00 dollars to pay for my full tuition for GLI summer camp, and in a pretty short amount time. I have received a half scholarship, however,<strong> if I do not raise all of my tuition for the Girls Leadership Institute on ""Indiegogo,"" than there is a possibility that I will not have the opportunity to attend GLI.</strong> In addition, 100% of your donations to my cause will be going to my tuition for Girls Leadership Institute summer camp. Furthermore, I can't stress enough on how every single dollar helps me get to Mount Holyoke College (where GLI summer camp is being held). Also, if I were to raise more than my goal, the extra money will go to transportation, paying for trips during GLI summer camp, supplies for camp, and any other expenses that will have to go into GLI summer camp. Now, what <em>you </em>get for donating to my cause depends on what amount of money you donate. For example, if you donate as little as $5.00, you will receive a virtual high-five! Woot! However, if you donate up to $1,000 or more you will receive all of the perks from, ""The Reflective Award,"" and you'll also be receiving a copy of one of Rachel Simmons book, with a personal note from myself. In addition, with every perk you will receive a virtual high-five, and a sincere, personal thank you because by donating, you will have helped me in so many ways you cannot even imagine. </p>
<h3>   Why Should You Send Me To GLI?</h3>
<p>       I understand that there are so many causes, which you are willing to give to, and you want to know why you should give your hard earned money to me. Well, because I am a good investment. Why am I a good investment? Because, by attending the Girls Leadership Institute I will gain self confidence and leadership skills of a life time. By gaining these skills, I will be able to change the world around me, and one day the entire world. My generation has to be the change, and I can help start that change through my experience at GLI. Furthermore, by donating even just a dollar we can get a step closer to a better world.     </p>
<h3>         No Money? No Problem!</h3>
<p>         Of course by sending financial assistance you are helping immensely. However, you can also help by sharing my cause with everyone you know, or even people you don't know! I would appreciate so much if you would take the time to share this link with your friends, neighbors, aunts, uncles, grandparents, co-workers, boyfriends, girlfriends, even people on Twitter, Tumblr, and Facebook! It would also mean a lot if you kept me in your thoughts and prayers, while I am on this amazing leadership journey. </p>
<p>I am extremely excited that I was given the opportunity to be a part of the Girls Leadership Institute, and by donating you can be a part of my amazing leadership journey.</p>

Hey everyone! My name is Mali Fenning and I am a girl who is 16 years young from Central Pennsylvania, who is aspiring to be a leader and change the world. I love this world and the people in it, I love the plants that grow from it, I love the sounds, I love the smells, I love how everyone has a different dream, I love the many opportunities we are given. I love this world a lot, but I also hate the brokenness and emptiness of this world as well.  All of my life I have had a BIG heart.

<h3>The Mission</h3>
<p>All About Business (AAB) was created by The Optimum Institute of Economic Empowerment (OIEE) to increase the financial literacy of inner city high school juniors and seniors. During the program students will write a financial literacy book, promote and market their book to raise funds for college.</p>
<p>Having the financial aptitude to make wise decisions with one’s income is a skill which will have a tremendous positive impact on long-term financial futures.  More often than not, youth have not been exposed to the principles of good money management (i.e. the importance of good credit, having a bank account, how to avoid financial predators, etc.).  It is important to instill these principles within our youth early so they can learn how to responsibly build a solid foundation for a prolific financial future.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Program</h3>
<p>OIEE’S Youth Financial Literacy Program is a 7 month program during which time students meet with a financial literacy instructor once a week. Meetings are held at the school during times most convenient for the teachers and administrators. The AAB curriculum includes interactive lessons that engage the students through classroom exercises. Topics include: the Importance of Saving, How to Avoid and Eliminate Debt, The Importance of Good Credit, Avoiding Financial Predators, Why I Need a Bank Account, What are Stocks?, Entrepreneurship, etc.  At the conclusion of the program, sponsors, parents, and school staff will be invited to a reception where the students will present how they have achieved the following goals: </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Increased awareness of Financial Literacy principles</em></li>
<li><em>Appreciation of a culture of fiscal responsibility</em></li>
<li><em>Ability to  more critically analyze their strategies for money management</em></li>
<li><em>Enhanced awareness of  civic responsibility and student leadership</em></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By participating in community service projects where students as Peer Leaders help others learn financial literacy concepts, they learn the importance of civic responsibility as they empower each other and the community. This component of the program is invaluable because students often come to the realization that self-worth is always greater than net worth.</p>
<p><strong>Examples of activities to be completed by the students include: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Develop their own personal finance website</li>
<li>Write multiple personal finance blogs to post to their site and advertise using social media (twitter, Facebook, etc.)</li>
<li>Conduct a filmed financial literacy (individual and group) workshop to be posted on youtube.com, and promoted via social media networks.</li>
<li>Participate in a group financial literacy book project.</li>
<li>Create a portfolio of achievements to <strong>submit to</strong> school and job recruiters.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3><strong>Use of Funds</strong></h3>
<p>The purpose of this campaign is to continue this program within two schools.  For a cost of $25,000 per school over a period of 7 months here is how the funds will be allocated.</p>
<ul>
<li>$10,000 Instruction fee to provide weekly instruction to youth for 7 months (2 sessions per week average). Edit student newsletters, student websites, and final book project.
<ul>
<li>$10,000 x 2 schools = <strong>$20,000</strong>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>$5000 Operational fee to coordinate schedules between instructors and schools, plan community outreach activities with students, organize student materials and writings, provide oversight to websites, and coordinate completion of book publishing.
<ul>
<li>$5,000 x 2 schools = <strong>$10,000</strong>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>$2500 Assistant instructor fee to assist to facilitate in the absence of head instructor and assist in the coordination/collection of homework, student website maintenance, and student newsletters.  
<ul>
<li>$2500 x 2 schools = <strong>$5000</strong>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>$2500 Impact measurement fee to provide analytical assessment and reporting of student progress pre and post program.
<ul>
<li>$2500 x 2 schools = <strong>$5000</strong>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>$2500</strong> Student book publishing/design costs</li>
<li>
<strong>$2500</strong> Initial purchasing of books for students to sell</li>
<li>
<strong>$5000 </strong>for food and expenses for students while on trips. </li>
</ul>
<p>There are many costs that are excluded from this budget that would enhance this program but with your help the initial $50K will give us a great start to a program that will do nothing but grow every year! </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<h3>I am completing my second year of studying Farsi and am a former teacher of Russian. Summer language programs in Russia were invaluable in my early training.</h3>
<h3>I was accepted for the Summer Farsi Language Program through the American Councils for International Education.    And just this quarter I learned the University of Washington will extend the Persian language program to a three- and possibly four-year program. So my goal of translating  works from Farsi to English looks more achievable than ever. </h3>
<h3>

</div></div>","I am completing my second year of studying Farsi and am a former teacher of Russian. Summer language programs in Russia were invaluable in my early training.
I was accepted for the Summer Farsi Language Program through the American Councils for International Education.    And just this quarter I learned the University of Washington will extend the Persian language program to a three- and possibly four-year program. So my goal of translating  works from Farsi to English looks more achievable than ever.

<h3>Camp Kadia's Story<br/>
</h3>
<p>Camp Kadia is a scholarship-based, overnight summer program for marginalized New York
 City teenagers designed to empower them and help them to take ownership over their educations and their futures.  Campers explore their creativity through visual and 
performing arts; learn basic skills for survival in the wilderness; 
develop strong, trusting relationships with their peers and adults; 
discuss social issues that affect their communities at home; and work 
together to create a self-sufficient community in a natural setting.  
When the summer ends, the young people are left with a network of adults
 and peers who support them throughout the year informally and at 
organized monthly activities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This year, Camp Kadia will have a professional social worker on site to provide therapeutic counseling and oversight of the programs adopted by the staff to build a community among the different campers at Camp Kadia.<br/></p>
<p>Check out the Camp Kadia link on the Fertile Grounds website: <a href=""http://www.fertilegrounds.org/campkadia"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.fertilegrounds.org/campkadia</a></p>
<p><br/>Here's a testimonial from one of our campers, who describes how camp affected her life:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>""In fifth grade I got in a lot of fights so the social worker at my school recommended Camp Kadia. I was really excited about going to camp. My first summer I was the youngest in my cabin. I got along with everyone and everyone loved me.  When I needed help the older kids helped me. I learned how to make a fire, what kind of wood you use, and I learned how to make up a tent. I also learned how to cook, how to swim, and I learned how to be a better actor. At the end of camp I had learned a lot and I had no problems with anyone. As for the person I was in the city, I felt like that person never came to camp with me.  I went home and helped my mom a lot. I went to camp ever year, and every time I come back I come back home with a new experience.  I remember when I was in the youngest cabin, and now Iâ€™m in the oldest cabin, and I always help everyone that needs help.  I and everyone in my cabin know we are role models for the younger kids and even the kids around our age (13 and 14). <strong>All year I talk about camp and Iâ€™m always excited to go - it's something I depend on.</strong>""</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Quite simply, the money raised through this campaign will mean the difference between children attending camp and remaining in the inner city for the summer.  <strong>All our campers are on full scholarship as they cannot afford to attend summer camp, so our scholarship program is absolutely crucial.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The money from the Growing From Our Roots campaign will go directly into a scholarship fund for Camp Kadia participants.  Most of our campers have never attended camp, or even taken a camping trip in the wilderness.  <strong>We want as many kids as possible to have the chance to attend Camp Kadia, and you can help us raise that number with your donation.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Even if we don't reach our $5,000 goal, the money we bring in will still be used directly in the scholarship fund.  If we DO reach $5,000 and we're still going strong, then we'll up the stakes and raise our goal.  The money is all going to the same place - this is for kids who could not otherwise afford to go to camp.<br/></p>
<p>As a sign of our own appreciation, we've got some swag that we want to give out to our supporters - check out the Perks to see how you can get Fertile Grounds magnets, t-shirts, promotional videos, and even some music made by our own campers!  If you donate more than $100, you'll get the chance to meet with one of our campers and talk to him or her about camp and the impact it can make on one's life.<br/></p>
<p>We at Fertile Grounds can't thank you enough for your help and support.<br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Get the word out to your friends and family!  Our campaign will succeed if we can stir up some serious grassroots interest.  <strong>Never underestimate the positive effect you can have on a fundraiser like this</strong> - word of mouth is our best friend (next to our contributors, of course)!<br/></p>

</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have chosen The National Midwifery Institute</div>
<div> </div>
<div>~because of my admiration and respect for founder, Elizabeth Davis, CPM, BA Holistic Maternity Care.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>~because it offers a curriculum specifically designed to meet the requirements of North American Registry of Midwives Certified Professional Midwife credential and the California Midwifery Practice Act (students who complete NMI's California Challenge program qualify to take the NMI Challenge Program Written Exam. Upon pasisng the exam, students qualify for the California licensing exam).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>~because it offers a self-guided study course which I can complete while continuing to offer my two young daughters the time and support I have worked so hard to be able to give to them. As a single mother I have chosen to sacrifice a great deal in order to mother my daughters in a way that is attuned to my beliefs and values. By choosing a self-study program, pairing with a preceptor in my community, I am not forced to leave my children in order to attend classes far from home, or move to a different community where an on-site midwifery program is located. My desire is to serve the community in which we LIVE. However, Title IV funding is NOT available for students in distance-only programs. This is why I am reaching out to my communinty for assistance.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Your investment in my education will yeild a competent, dedicated midwife who's work will enhance the well-being of women and children in Southern Humboldt and Northern Mendocino counties, and possibly beyond. It will also enable the preservation of knowledge and skills crucial to the homeostasis of our species as it relates to the Whole, the web of Life.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
</div>
<div>I am aware that not everyone can offer financial support. I am grateful for all the love and upliftment offered up to my family everyday by so many people in this luminous community. Your prayers, mindfulness, focused intention, and kindness are as valuable to me as currency.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you would like to help without contributing money, please contact me. An offering of time, particularly nurturing time spent with my children while I study or attend births as an assistant or doula, is an invaluable contribution.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Another very valuable way in which you can uplift that which nourishes Life is to contribute to the education of an aspiring midwife or doula in your home community or family. Or stand in solidarity with your local midwives and wise-woman care givers by offering them your political, social, financial, and spiritual support.</div></div>","From the Root to the Fruit....

~because of my admiration and respect for founder, Elizabeth Davis, CPM, BA Holistic Maternity Care.
 
~because it offers a curriculum specifically designed to meet the requirements of North American Registry of Midwives Certified Professional Midwife credential and the California Midwifery Practice Act (students who complete NMI's California Challenge program qualify to take the NMI Challenge Program Written Exam. Upon pasisng the exam, students qualify for the California licensing exam).
 
~because it offers a self-guided study course which I can complete while continuing to offer my two young daughters the time and support I have worked so hard to be able to give to them. As a single mother I have chosen to sacrifice a great deal in order to mother my daughters in a way that is attuned to my beliefs and values. By choosing a self-study program, pairing with a preceptor in my community, I am not forced to leave my children in order to attend classes far from home, or move to a different community where an on-site midwifery program is located. My desire is to serve the community in which we LIVE. However, Title IV funding is NOT available for students in distance-only programs. This is why I am reaching out to my communinty for assistance.
 
Your investment in my education will yeild a competent, dedicated midwife who's work will enhance the well-being of women and children in Southern Humboldt and Northern Mendocino counties, and possibly beyond. It will also enable the preservation of knowledge and skills crucial to the homeostasis of our species as it relates to the Whole, the web of Life.
 

Other Ways You Can Help

I am aware that not everyone can offer financial support. I am grateful for all the love and upliftment offered up to my family everyday by so many people in this luminous community. Your prayers, mindfulness, focused intention, and kindness are as valuable to me as currency.
 
If you would like to help without contributing money, please contact me. An offering of time, particularly nurturing time spent with my children while I study or attend births as an assistant or doula, is an invaluable contribution.
 
Another very valuable way in which you can uplift that which nourishes Life is to contribute to the education of an aspiring midwife or doula in your home community or family. Or stand in solidarity with your local midwives and wise-woman care givers by offering them your political, social, financial, and spiritual support.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello Everyone, </p>
<p> </p>
<p>                   My name is Darius Mitchell and i am a proud, devoted father of two children. I am here to present a fund raising campaign that iv'e created for my oldest daughter (Kori Mitchell) age 13yrs old. Kori attends David Ellis Academy West School (Redford, Mi) The purpose of this campaign is to raise funds that are needed for Kori's educational trip to Australia for the summer of 2013, structured by People to People Ambassador Programs. I can't explain the joy that my daughter had when she initially brought to my attention of the opportunity to attend this trip. At a young age, Kori has always spoke of how she would travel the world one day, and now that she realizes that she has the opportunity to accomplish her first trip at such a young age makes her even more excited. This is not only important to her, but it is very important to me as well. I myself didn't get an opportunity as such as a youth and i know this will be a great learning experience for Kori and also give her a stronger educational influence. As a devoted father of two children, i am determined to make sure that my children receive all of their opportunities and help them accomplish any goals toward their education and positive life experiences. In this particular case, there are required funds to make this happen and unfortunately we don't have the luxury of being as able as we would like to be, therefore we humbly reach out to you for any assistance toward Kori's educational trip. With your gracious, generous donations and our hard work, i am confident that we can accomplish our goal together.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What is Needed &amp; Your Perks</h3>
<p>The funds needed for Kori's trip to Australia is $6,173.00. These funds will go toward her flights, passport, room and board, food, clothing and other travel needs with her group. We also plan to pursue other avenues to raise funds such as selling candy, bake sales, dinners and Kori would like to do some events for other kids to do while raising funds. We have set up some nice perks for you to receive for your donations. Several perks to exclusive events have been set up with The Refinement Group <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/Therefinementgroup313"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.facebook.com/Therefinementgroup313</a> We are very excited to have you be apart of this amazing experience for Kori.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We understand and know that everyone wants to be an impact in life. This is an opportunity to make not only an impact for the community youth, but contribute toward an educational experience. Our youth is our future leaders of the world. I personally can relate to a project like this, as i have done three charity events this year through my group (The Refinement Group), raising funds for honarable organizations such as Big Brothers Big Sisters of Metro Detroit - Lupus Alliance of America Michigan and DO Foundation (Homeless Charity) and had great success.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We do understand that some people may not be able to contribute to our campaign, but we do want you to understand that any and all support is greatly appreciated. We aske that if you can spread the word to your family, friends and sharing our campaign link to your social media and or email would be a major help to us.

<h3>Why I Am Asking For Your Help</h3>
<p>My name is Obi and I am a 7th grader in San Francisco, California.  I was selected as a student ambassador to Japan next summer, and I really want to be able to go, to represent my country and meet kids from all around the world.  The problem is, we don't have enough extra money to pay for the trip.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Will Receive in Return</h3>
<p>People to People is organizing the trip -- and everything is included in one price -- my flight, lodging, food, and travel within Japan.  $7,000 will cover all of that.  Help me be on that plane to Japan with my fellow People to People Student Ambassadors!</p>
<p>For those of you that make a contribution over $25, you will receive a friendship bracelet made by hand, by my mother Odelia.  She is going to make me one too, and I am going to wear it in Japan.  In that way we will be connected when I am there.</p>
<p>For those of you that make a contribution over $100, you will recieve a friendship bracelet, and I will have my picture taken, wearing the bracelet, at different places in Japan so that you can see where our friendship has taken me!  </p>
<p>For those of you that make a contribution over $200, you will recieve a friendship bracelet, photos of me in Japan emailed to you, and a  T-shirt with a cool photo of me in Japan printed on it.  You will receive the photos and T-shirt after my return in the summer of 2013.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Being a Student Ambassador</h3>
<p>If I get to go to Japan, I will have the opportunity to meet kids from all around the world, and share my culture with them.  I am an American, with a Camarounian mother and a Nigerian father.  I want to be able to share with others in Japan what we learn in school, what we like to eat, and what we do for fun.  I want to learn about their cultures and lifestyles too.  It will be a real cultural exchange, one that I will always remember, and one that I will tell my children about, and that they will tell their children about.</p>
<p>This will be my first trip outside of the country.  When I return, I will share my experience in my school and in that way will be an ambassador of the spirit and friendship that comes from travelling abroad and understanding that we are all the same as human beings, no matter our cultural differences, our religion, or the color of our skin.  </p>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Sharing this campaign widely with your friends on facebook and on email will be a huge help.  The more people that get introduced to me and my campaign, the better my chances of raising the money I need.  So please, even if you can not make a contribution, send this on to someone who you think might care.</p>
</div>
<p>Thank you all so much.  I can't wait to go to Japan!!!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Welcome everyone let me introduce myself. I am Darin Bicknell a Montessorian who has been teaching for over 16 years. I have recently opened my own Montessori school here in Indonesia which in June of 2013 will host students from 6 to 13 years of age, using newly created Montessori albums for the middle school and secondary school years. I am very passionate about integrating my own albums that I have developed into a digital format that can be shared with other Montessorians around the world. If we are able to achieve our goal of $5000 USD we will be able to successfully put this program up for the Montessori community. The donations will go a long way to support the development of a set of Creative Commons Montessori Albums for the Middle School and Secondary level that will be available to Montessori community at large as soon as they are ready.</p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>The cost of the project goes into mainly the design of the software for tracking the students progress but also the development of the albums and scope and sequence as the core that enables Montessorians to seamlessly track their students through the observational model employed by Montessori. </p>
<p>As this project will be a quick turn around we expect to have a working beta test by February 2013 and we will allow beta tester who have donated $50 to use the software by May 2013.</p>
<p>If we do not reach 5000 the monies will still go into the development of this project for programming costs.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>This project is unique to the Montessori community as it will allow schools a frame work to move from Elementary to Secondary. We also have plans to scale this project into the Kindergarten and Elementary for those who would like to adapt it.</p>
<p>As a montessorian we all know that projects like this are essential to the development of Montessori and with your help we can achieve this goal.</p>

<h3 style="""">Dear Friends / Colleagues,</h3>
<p style="""">At the end of May, I will be climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. This has been a personal goal of mine for quite some time. Leading up to this climb, I am raising money for a charity called the Good Hope Orphanage, located in Arusha, Tanzania. I really hope to make a positive impact in these kids' lives and help in any way possible, and I hope you will join me for the journey. A little bit about the Good Hope Orphanage 501(c)(3) non-profit (<a href=""http://www.goodhopeorphanage.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.goodhopeorphanage.org</a>):</p>
<p style=""""><em>Our Goal: Good Hope is dedicated to taking children off the streets and providing them with the basic necessities of life (food, education and shelter) as well as a whole lot of love.</em></p>
<p style=""""><em>Our Mission: To see that no child in Tanzania goes hungry, unsheltered, unloved or uneducated.</em></p>
<p style=""""><em>Good Hope provides a safe home, three meals per day, and clothing for the children.

</div></div>","Dear Friends / Colleagues,
At the end of May, I will be climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. This has been a personal goal of mine for quite some time. Leading up to this climb, I am raising money for a charity called the Good Hope Orphanage, located in Arusha, Tanzania. I really hope to make a positive impact in these kids' lives and help in any way possible, and I hope you will join me for the journey. A little bit about the Good Hope Orphanage 501(c)(3) non-profit (www.goodhopeorphanage.org):
Our Goal: Good Hope is dedicated to taking children off the streets and providing them with the basic necessities of life (food, education and shelter) as well as a whole lot of love.
Our Mission: To see that no child in Tanzania goes hungry, unsheltered, unloved or uneducated.
Good Hope provides a safe home, three meals per day, and clothing for the children. Meals include milk, tea, ugali/rice, beans/meat as well as fresh fruit and vegetables when available. It is completely funded through volunteers, sponsorships and donations provided by people who find it in their heart to help.
I will be taking the Machame route up to the Kili summit, which will be 7 days in total. From there, I am off for a 2-day safari departing for Lake Manyara National Park, where I'm sure I'll learn to become adept at running away from wild animals.
The recommended donation amount is $20, but please do feel free to donate less or more as you wish. Anyone who donates more than $20 gets to see a video of me being chased by a lion :)
I will be funding the cost of the climb myself, so any money you generously donate will be going 100% to the charity and the orphanage. I plan to visit the orphanage while I am there as well.
I am very excited about this venture, and your support and encouragement really mean a lot to me!

<h4>Hi Everybody!</h4><p>My name is Duncan and I live in England. Since 2006 I have been teaching spoken English to the world via YouTube. I have been doing this on my own and in my own time for free.I do not charge anything to anyone for my material. During the past seven years I have helped thousands of people of all ages around the world improve their spoken English. My lessons are video based, which allows me to make them in a fun and creative way, using vivid imagery. Virtually all of my video lessons are subtitled.

This campaign originally ended - February 2014.

Hi Everybody!My name is Duncan and I live in England. Since 2006 I have been teaching spoken English to the world via YouTube. I have been doing this on my own and in my own time for free.I do not charge anything to anyone for my material. During the past seven years I have helped thousands of people of all ages around the world improve their spoken English. My lessons are video based, which allows me to make them in a fun and creative way, using vivid imagery. Virtually all of my video lessons are subtitled. Of course all of this producing takes time...and there are overheads (running costs) to meet. I have worked abroad as an English teacher and spent 4 years teaching oral English in China. Popularity...Thousands of students in over 125 countries now follow my lessons, which means that I must devote more of my time to this venture.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a="""">This spring 13 courageous students
will be traveling to Eastern Europe (Lithuania, Poland and the Czech Republic) to learn about the Holocaust and the fate of the European Jews through visiting some of the most notorious sites the world has ever known: Auschwitz, Ponary, Ninthfort, Treblinka, Majdanek, the Warsaw Ghetto, and more. <br/><br/><p>As our official website (<a href=""http://www.alvernoholocausttrip.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.alvernoholocausttrip.com</a>) explains: ""As
with all travel courses, exposure to foreign cultures and languages provides a
learning experience distinct from that found in the classroom. A visit to the
historical places of the Holocaust can help students attempt to comprehend
its enormity in the context of its geography and history. It may seem incongruous
but a visit to the sites of mass murder as well as sites that once contained
vital Jewish communities can be a transformative experience for the serious
student of the Holocaust.""</p>
<p>But we need your help. The trip is costly and we are trying to offset the expense for our students. It is the trip of a lifetime and a deeply transformative experience. <br/></p><p>Please partner with us to help keep the memory alive.<i><b><br/></b></i></p>
<p><b>What these students bring back with them will
change the world. </b></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Here are few responses from students who are going this year:</p><p>
</p><p><b>Breanne Pemberton:</b> <i> Why is this important to me? With the amount of
misunderstandings which happen cross-culturally as humans, with their
neighbors, and across nations, I think it’s extremely important to understand
and gain knowledge of other’s cultures. By doing this, one is able better to
understand cultural differences, but more importantly the similarities we all
share as humans.  <br/></i></p><p><i>As many recognize, racism exists greatly in our
community, our country, and the rest of the world.  Teaching about racism
can be difficult when it’s right in front of our face everyday.  By
learning about racism through the teachings of the historical background of
anti-semitism and what allowed for the Holocaust to take place, I think it
helps to highlight the injustices and inequalities happening all around us in
the present.  <br/></i></p><p><i>By furthering my knowledge and going to the places of the
Holocaust, I can spread what I have learned and raise awareness to others in
hopes of moving toward and making our communities more accepting places to live

and blood. We are connected through our similarities in cultures, communities,

<p>""The trip, in my mind, was to
honor the millions of Jews who were killed in the Holocaust.  I went not
looking for answers, but for understanding.  I needed more depth to my
academic unit on the Holocaust, I needed more confidence in my ability to teach
the Holocaust, and I needed to experience these sites of the Holocaust in
person.  These three areas have not only helped me in my understanding of
this time in history; but also, in my understanding of myself.  <br/>
I teach a Holocaust unit to 7th and 8th graders every other year."" 
--Kim Maxon <i>(Madison Middle School Teacher)</i></p>
<p>"" I couldn't quite express all
that I saw, felt, and learned visiting the places of the Holocaust--the
experience was overwhelming, intense, and shocking. But I felt that now it was my responsibility to bear witness--the torch had been passed by simply visiting these places. So when returned from the trip I searched for a way to make the experience
known to my school and community. I founded the Alverno Holocaust Remembrance
Service which brings a Holocaust survivor to our campus every year to speak. It
is now in its 14th year and there is over 1000 high school, middle school and
college age students in attendance.  --Sue DaBaco <i>(Assistant Director

<p></p></div>","This spring 13 courageous students
will be traveling to Eastern Europe (Lithuania, Poland and the Czech Republic) to learn about the Holocaust and the fate of the European Jews through visiting some of the most notorious sites the world has ever known: Auschwitz, Ponary, Ninthfort, Treblinka, Majdanek, the Warsaw Ghetto, and more. As our official website (www.alvernoholocausttrip.com) explains: ""As
with all travel courses, exposure to foreign cultures and languages provides a
learning experience distinct from that found in the classroom. A visit to the
historical places of the Holocaust can help students attempt to comprehend
its enormity in the context of its geography and history. It may seem incongruous
but a visit to the sites of mass murder as well as sites that once contained
vital Jewish communities can be a transformative experience for the serious
student of the Holocaust.""
But we need your help. The trip is costly and we are trying to offset the expense for our students. It is the trip of a lifetime and a deeply transformative experience. Please partner with us to help keep the memory alive.
What these students bring back with them will
change the world. 

Here are few responses from students who are going this year:
Breanne Pemberton:  Why is this important to me? With the amount of
misunderstandings which happen cross-culturally as humans, with their
neighbors, and across nations, I think it’s extremely important to understand
and gain knowledge of other’s cultures. By doing this, one is able better to
understand cultural differences, but more importantly the similarities we all
share as humans.  As many recognize, racism exists greatly in our
community, our country, and the rest of the world.  Teaching about racism
can be difficult when it’s right in front of our face everyday.  By
learning about racism through the teachings of the historical background of
anti-semitism and what allowed for the Holocaust to take place, I think it
helps to highlight the injustices and inequalities happening all around us in
the present.  By furthering my knowledge and going to the places of the
Holocaust, I can spread what I have learned and raise awareness to others in
hopes of moving toward and making our communities more accepting places to live
and to raise our children.

I am originally from Staten Island, NY, and studied Marine Science at the University of South Carolina on full scholarship. Unfortunately, scholarships for veterinary school are extremely limited, and the cost for in-state tuition at Cornell CVM is currently $31,800 per year. I have a very busy schedule, between studying the animal body and the pathogenesis of diseases, volunteering at and fostering for the Tompkins County SPCA, manning Cornell's Pet Loss Support Hotline, and helping train future guide dogs. But I am also trying to offset the costs by working at the Cornell Animal Hospital as a small animal surgery technician about once a week on an on-call basis, for a few hours per week for a low-cost spay-neuter clinic, and pet sitting as often as possible, but all of these don't even make a dent against my educational debt. I am hoping to offset the cost of my funding from the help of generous donors like you.</p><h3>Future Non-Profit Veterinarian</h3><p>I am interested in Shelter Medicine and Non-Profit work. I am working on starting a non-profit organization that will incorporate an animal shelter, a non-profit subsidized hospital for low-income pet owners, and a community center (including a dog park and seminar- and classrooms for owner education), but this dream won't come to full fruition until I receive my DVM degree in just under three years. Since I will be doing non-profit work for the rest of my life, I would like to minimize the debt I am incurring from my veterinary education.</p><p></p><h3>The Cost of Veterinary Education</h3><div>I receive in-state tuition from Cornell because I am a New York State resident, so I am saving $15,000 per year, but it is still $31,800 per year. My rent is only $550/month, which is very cheap for Ithaca. I use the library and free online veterinary text books instead of purchasing the texts required for our courses. I use as little electricity as possible and keep my heat at only 60 degrees F during the cold Ithaca winters, bike to school as much as I can to save on gas, don't eat out, and am generally a very frugal person.<p></p>
<p>Basically, I am doing everything I can to minimize my costs, but this only does so much.</p>
<p>The cost of veterinary education is particularly ridiculous considering it costs about as much to attend vet school as med school, and yet veterinarians make a fraction of what human doctors make. And as a non-profit vet, I will be making even less!</p>
<p>I only have a goal of $500 because I know everyone else is struggling with debt as well (thus why I will be working as a non-profit veterinarian). Any donations will help.</p>
<p>If you can't donate, at least vote for legislators that are committed to helping minimize student debt.</p>
</div><p></p><h3>Shelter Medicine and Increasing Access to Vet Care</h3><div>Shelter medicine, which is healing animals while they are in an animal shelter, has come a long way in the past decade or two, especially with the rise of the No-Kill movement. But there are still about 6-8 million animals entering shelters annually, and about half are still euthanized, often due to overcrowding and lack of resources (funding). By operating a no-kill shelter, I will provide the best healthcare and welfare for my future shelter's animals.<p></p>
<p>The other side of the coin is shelter intake. Many animals are surrendered to shelters because their owners are unable to afford appropriate veterinary care. By operating a non-profit animal hospital, I will be able to provide my future low-income clients with high quality veterinary services that are subsidized by donations.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>Game Based Learning</h3> <p>There's a lot of talk out there these days about game based learning.  As often happens in education, things are either moving very slowly, or way too quickly.  Everyone seems to be bandwagoning onto this idea without much forethought.  On the other hand, there are few games out there that actually take into account state education standards, fewer that consider high schoolers, and none that bring together the core subjects in one game.  </p>
<p>As veteran teachers with a passion for gaming, we recognized the fact that traditional school often seems irrelevant to students because it seemingly has little to do with their day to day lives.  We were also witness to the spotty at best coverage of standards from the games currently being produced ""for education"". </p>
<p>We said to ourselves, what if we could get together subject-matter experts, and game designers, and create a learning adventure where students would feel motivated to achieve content mastery because there was a direct benefit to them (i.e. getting ahead in the game.)</p>
<p>We also believe that there is a powerful connection between learning and collaboration, and collaboration is projected to be one of the most important aspects of the workplace of the future.  This is why we developed the idea as a Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) game.  This way, kids could collaborate with other kids on their level, regardless of where they were attending school. </p>
<p>One last important thing about the game.  In most games, the heroes are some form of fantastical being, elves, or wizards.  We didn't want to do that.  We want kids to get an idea of where their learning can take them.  So the classes are things like: Diplomat, Statesman, Artist, Scientist, Mathematician.  And then students can gain abilities to use within the game by leveling up skills.  For example, a common idea kids come up with for solving global issues is, ""why don't we just bomb them?"" Ok, as we know, that's not always the best answer, but the game would allow them to do this, provided they have the right skills.  So, if they wanted to be able to bomb another country, they would either have to study rhetoric, law, history, and economics, in order to become a statesman, or they would have to study physics, chemistry and engineering to be able to launch a rocket on their own.  </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need </h3> <p>We have the teachers, however, we are all currently working for free on this project.  The next thing we need is a game designer/artist.  While we would love to think that our art would appeal to kids, we know that there are people who do this professionally, and they expect to be paid for their work.  </p>
<p>We are currently asking for 20,000 dollars, which seems like a lot of money, but considering the fact that many games cost over One Million dollars to produce this is a very conservative start.  </p>
<p>This will give us enough money to rent an office, and hire an artist to work on the art for a few months while we try to court other investors and game companies.  </p>
<p>We would love to raise more than the goal, and be able to start actually making the game right away, rather than concept art! If we are able to raise 80,000 dollars, we would be able to contract a game developer to work with on this project.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>We've go some great perks!  Check out this classy tee-shirt: <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/828693/files/20140902082231-PlatoTeeFront150.jpg?1409671351"" src="""" style=""""/>Front</p>

<p>That's right, show your passion for education, your sense of humor, and your support for a good company all in one snazzy tee.  Who could ask for more?</p>
<p>But wait! There's more! There are other perks like having your likeness made into a character in the game: Who wouldn't want to be forever memorialized in the likeness of a kindly principal, or the feisty janitor?  I know I would!</p>
<p>You can also get beta access to the game (for those non-gamey types out there, that means you get to try it out before we actually try to sell it, while it's still in testing, and give us your feedback).  Remember all those times when someone told you to keep your opinion to yourself?  Well not this time friend!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Were you bored in school?  Are your kids? Ever had a kid ask you, ""why do we have to learn this?"" </p>
<p>If so, you already know why this idea is important.  Teachers are completely overloaded, they don't have time to make up extra lessons for your kid just because he/she is way ahead, or way behind.  Games can do that.  The game would keep kids at the level they belong at as long as they need to be.  So if your kid is really advanced, they would advance quickly through the game and be able to experience extension learning.  If your kid is really far behind, they would be able to work at their own level without embarrassment.  </p>
<p>The idea behind the name for ZPD Games, is the Zone of Proximal Development, a term coined by educational theorist Vygotski, who stated that everyone has level of challenge that is just right for them, and when one presented with challenges within their ZPD, they learn more efficiently.  Too difficult, and people tend to give up, to easy, and they tend to get bored.  It's impossible for a teacher to create 36 individualized learning plans, but it's not impossible for a game to do so.  </p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Are you trying to get rid of teachers?</h3> <p>Heavens no! We are teachers!  We are trying to change the way lessons are delivered.  And we are trying to change the role of the teacher from sole purveyor and vessel of knowledge, to guide, facilitator, and contextualizer of knowledge.  The teacher's role would be to help students bring together and create understanding from what they are learning in game.  This means that there would most certainly be times where students were not playing, but rather talking/writing about their experiences, or working on a real-world project inspired by something they created within the game.  </p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you can't help, at least try to get the word out! I've said several times, that if I just had five dollars from every person who told me this was a good idea, I would have already have the game made.  Like us on Facebook /ZPDGames follow us on Twitter @zpdgames and don't forget to share this campaign with anyone and everyone.  We have to work together to create the curriculum of the future before the big textbook publishers decide to take over and put a shiny digital wrapper on the same old curriculum.  </p>
</div></div>","Game Based Learning There's a lot of talk out there these days about game based learning.  As often happens in education, things are either moving very slowly, or way too quickly.  Everyone seems to be bandwagoning onto this idea without much forethought.  On the other hand, there are few games out there that actually take into account state education standards, fewer that consider high schoolers, and none that bring together the core subjects in one game.  
As veteran teachers with a passion for gaming, we recognized the fact that traditional school often seems irrelevant to students because it seemingly has little to do with their day to day lives.  We were also witness to the spotty at best coverage of standards from the games currently being produced ""for education"". 
We said to ourselves, what if we could get together subject-matter experts, and game designers, and create a learning adventure where students would feel motivated to achieve content mastery because there was a direct benefit to them (i.e. getting ahead in the game.)
We also believe that there is a powerful connection between learning and collaboration, and collaboration is projected to be one of the most important aspects of the workplace of the future.  This is why we developed the idea as a Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) game.  This way, kids could collaborate with other kids on their level, regardless of where they were attending school. 
One last important thing about the game.  In most games, the heroes are some form of fantastical being, elves, or wizards.  We didn't want to do that.  We want kids to get an idea of where their learning can take them.  So the classes are things like: Diplomat, Statesman, Artist, Scientist, Mathematician.  And then students can gain abilities to use within the game by leveling up skills.  For example, a common idea kids come up with for solving global issues is, ""why don't we just bomb them?"" Ok, as we know, that's not always the best answer, but the game would allow them to do this, provided they have the right skills.  So, if they wanted to be able to bomb another country, they would either have to study rhetoric, law, history, and economics, in order to become a statesman, or they would have to study physics, chemistry and engineering to be able to launch a rocket on their own.     What We Need  We have the teachers, however, we are all currently working for free on this project.  The next thing we need is a game designer/artist.  While we would love to think that our art would appeal to kids, we know that there are people who do this professionally, and they expect to be paid for their work.  
We are currently asking for 20,000 dollars, which seems like a lot of money, but considering the fact that many games cost over One Million dollars to produce this is a very conservative start.  
This will give us enough money to rent an office, and hire an artist to work on the art for a few months while we try to court other investors and game companies.  
We would love to raise more than the goal, and be able to start actually making the game right away, rather than concept art! If we are able to raise 80,000 dollars, we would be able to contract a game developer to work with on this project.

What You GetWe've go some great perks!  Check out this classy tee-shirt: Front
Back 
That's right, show your passion for education, your sense of humor, and your support for a good company all in one snazzy tee.  Who could ask for more?
But wait! There's more! There are other perks like having your likeness made into a character in the game: Who wouldn't want to be forever memorialized in the likeness of a kindly principal, or the feisty janitor?  I know I would!
You can also get beta access to the game (for those non-gamey types out there, that means you get to try it out before we actually try to sell it, while it's still in testing, and give us your feedback).  Remember all those times when someone told you to keep your opinion to yourself?  Well not this time friend!
And since the game is still in concept form, you can still grab our top perk, you get to name the game.  That's right, for a mere 10,000 dollars, you can name the game.  

I know, it's a lot, I'm still reeling myself.  

The Impact Were you bored in school?  Are your kids? Ever had a kid ask you, ""why do we have to learn this?""

The Impact of Suicide: Serious Reasons to Give 


Suicide is a serious public health concern and rates of suicide are rising. 


It is the 10th leading cause of death in the US and 2nd cause of death for youth (accidents are 1st).  


More die by suicide than homicide each year. 


Tragically 41,149 people died by suicide in the U.S (2013), an average of 112 per day. 


The rate of suicide in the US is 13 per 100,000 population and has been consistently on the rise for years. 


Suicide rates are highest among middle aged males  45-54 (19/100,000 pop). 


Comparatively in CA, many of the rural counties have much higher rates of suicide- we help individuals at risk in rural counties with 24hr access to emotional support, resources, and intervention. 


As rates of suicide and calls for help increase across the state and nationally, finding funding for suicide prevention crisis centers is a challenge.  Now is the time to give.


Suicide impacts so many in significant and sometimes traumatic ways each year. In 2013, an estimated  9 million adults had serious thoughts of suicide in the last year.  Among high school students, more than 17% (2.5 million)have seriously considered suicide and  8% report attempting suicide in the last year.  


A recent research based estimate suggested that  4.7 million are exposed to suicide deaths (Cerel, 2015)- an average of 115 suicide loss survivors per suicide. Among that average 115 loss survivors, 25 experience a major life disruption, leaving an estimated 1 million suicide loss survivors each year in serious need of support.

letters, to learn how to combine them in order to read or write? None of our
knowledge has come to us without an effort. ABC’s is the beginning of our way

<p><b>The goal</b></p>
<p>I have
created the project “Sunny, Funny ABC’s” in English so that children all over
the world can learn Alphabet with great fun and ease! Children love to learn,
while they play and they love to play, while they learn. I offer different associations
for children in the process of learning: visual, audial and kinesthetic.
Children’s brains will make the necessary connections on their own and
complicated things will be learned easily and effortlessly. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/979658/files/20141102103614-IMG_0169.jpg?1414953374"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><b>The idea</b></p>
<p>There are many
letters in the Alphabet and they are usually linked to nouns. Also, the
sequence of<span>  the letters seems to be
confusing to so many.  I have created a
link between all letters of the Alphabet by creating stories, where I use
nouns, adjectives and verbs. I have found the best matches for each letter!<br/></span></p><p><span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/979661/files/20141102103701-alfabets-_02722_.jpg?1414953421"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

There are several different characters that I use in this project, for
example,  awesome beetle, gorgeous
hippopotamuses, naughty octopuses, the royal spider and others. These characters
form alphabetical order. The stories gradually turn into animations. <p>“Sunny Funny ABC’s”

<p>Hi, my name is Nina Ijere-Otuka, an Atlanta, Georgia based business consultant and trainer whose services transcend beyond the shores of the United States extending to some African countries. My last business trip to a West African country, Nigeria, to be precise, led to research that revealed the statistics above. Subsequently, this has sparked a new movement that has become very dear to my heart - an urgent need to provide <b>deodorants </b>with other sanitary necessities to young girls in Africa!</p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Frankly, what started off as irksome, later led to my summoning up courage to accost some of the young girls that I came in contact with who had body odor problem. While it was not an easy conversation to initiate, in hindsight,I am so glad I did, remembering the smiles on their faces and their eagerness to learn more about personal hygiene. To the best of my ability, I shared some good personal hygiene habits with them and in addition, gave them money to buy some deodorants. <br/></span></p>
<p><span>Thereafter, I thought  if they can't even afford a deodorant, who knows what they use during their monthly cycle. WOW! What difference it would make to be able reach a larger percentage of young girls with these sanitary necessities as doing so will help them practice good personal hygiene, increase their self esteem, self-worth and boost their confidence to enable them participate at par with their counterparts in the society at large all while smelling fresh :)</span></p>

 Did you know that a large number of young girls in Africa have poor 
hygiene leading to body odor and a lot of them cannot afford deodorant?
Did you know that poor hygiene and sanitation contribute to increased child mortality rate? (Source: UNICEF)
Did you know that 1 out of 10 school girls in Africa miss classes or drop out completely due 
to their period and substitute pads, tampons for less safe and less 
absorbent material such as rags, news paper and bark? (Source: UNICEF)

You're not alone if you didn't know, I too was awoken by these statistics. 


Hi, my name is Nina Ijere-Otuka, an Atlanta, Georgia based business consultant and trainer whose services transcend beyond the shores of the United States extending to some African countries. My last business trip to a West African country, Nigeria, to be precise, led to research that revealed the statistics above. Subsequently, this has sparked a new movement that has become very dear to my heart - an urgent need to provide deodorants with other sanitary necessities to young girls in Africa!

Frankly, what started off as irksome, later led to my summoning up courage to accost some of the young girls that I came in contact with who had body odor problem. While it was not an easy conversation to initiate, in hindsight,I am so glad I did, remembering the smiles on their faces and their eagerness to learn more about personal hygiene. To the best of my ability, I shared some good personal hygiene habits with them and in addition, gave them money to buy some deodorants. 
Thereafter, I thought  if they can't even afford a deodorant, who knows what they use during their monthly cycle. WOW! What difference it would make to be able reach a larger percentage of young girls with these sanitary necessities as doing so will help them practice good personal hygiene, increase their self esteem, self-worth and boost their confidence to enable them participate at par with their counterparts in the society at large all while smelling fresh :)


Your support will help us achieve our goal of providing at least 1000 young African girls with deodorants by December 2014, in time for Christmas. In addition, we would include other sanitary products to help them manage their personal hygiene better . We would start with young girls in Nigeria, since this campaign was inspired by my experience visiting Nigeria. With your support, we plan to visit other African countries.

Project Details:
We have grown to become quite passionate about this mission and are excited to not only provide deodorants with other sanitary items - a much needed necessity.
Additionally, we will teach them ways to maintain good personal hygiene. Doing these would help to increase her literacy about good personal hygiene while increasing her self confidence and subsequently enable her to SHINE BRIGHT in the community without any form of inhibition.
We hope that you would find fulfillment in putting a smile on the faces  of these young girls with your support during this Christmas holiday - a season of good tidings, joy and love!
Gift Bag/Hamper Content

Each personal hygiene gift bag/hamper will contain but not limited to the following:

Deodorant/anti-antiperspirant (of course)
Sanitary towels
Oral care items
Shaving items

As aforementioned, our goal is to start with Nigeria by giving out at least 1000 sanitary gift bags and later vist other Afrucan countries. To achieve this, we will need to raise at least $6,750 by December 18th, 2014. Indeed, 1000 beneficiaries might sound like a drop in a mighty ocean, but we believe that reaching ONE is better than NONE and we are committed to diligently utilizing the available resources to reach as many young African girls as possible. We will keep you posted of our progress with pictures, videos and blog updates.


We
 will be going into rural areas, that are not very sanitary, the roads 
are not as good to travel on, mainly dirt roads, water is not very good to 
drink, but someone need to do it and we are taking that step of faith in this movement.
As an appreciation for your kind gesture and support, we will send you a hand written thank you note from one of the benefiting young girls.

Additional Impacts:
The truth is that for less than what we spend on the average at a dinner in a restaurant; we are able to make a huge difference in the lives of these young girls. Your support will be a visible expression of love and care to them thereby motivating them to engage in activities that will build up their self-esteem.

As of 2015, TCF has established 1060 purpose-built school units nationwide with an enrollment of 165,000 students. TCF is recognised internationally, with chapters across the globe.With your help, I’d like run the New York marathon to raise enough money to fund a TCF school in need for an entire academic year. This will enable almost 200 children to be able to continue their education.The school that needs our help in the coming year is a primary school located in the community of Saleh Muhammad Goth, Bin Qasim Town, Karachi.
Next year the school's enrollment is expected to surge from 176 students to 194, all of whom will benefit from this donation. 
The campus has a female enrollment of 47%. This demonstrates the high level of importance given to female education by the community. 


For more information on TCF and its work, go to: www.tcf.org.pk WHAT I'M DOING: The New York Marathon is a grueling 26 mile run, and I’ve been training for it for the past six months! I’ll be sharing my preparations for the marathon on my Facebook page so you can stay involved!For updates on my training and TCF's work, go to my Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/HamnaRunsForTCF

HOW YOU CAN HELP: Every little bit helps, whether it’s $5 or $500! Please spread the word, tell your family and friends! 

And when you donate, please go ahead and donate in the memory of someone you love. Email us at hamnaruns@gmail.com and tell us your story, and we'll share it on our Facebook page. This campaign is about celebrating the people who mean the most to us and finding a way to pay it forward.



Every dollar donated will motivate me to take that extra step towards the finish line – I’m counting on your support!
