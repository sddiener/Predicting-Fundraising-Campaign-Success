<p><b>The Artist:</b> <a href=""http://www.jimgarmhausenart.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.jimgarmhausenart.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.jimgarmhausenart.com/</a><br/>I spent many years as a cartoonist, selling to weekly papers with small successes along the way, and my style reflects that background. There is an emphasis on characters, and particularly faces. The theme of my work, if there is one, comes out of the collective expression of these many characters, and the feeling that pours into them as I let them into the world, line by line. ​<span style=""background-color: initial;"">I create art because it feels absolutely essential to do so, and to hold back on it creates dark shadows and internal disturbances and has me lurking about in ways that worry people. </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">I am drawn to aged, worn surfaces, and display work in cheap antique framing that gives a sense of a rediscovery of something stored away and forgotten.</span></p>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""></span>

<li><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Governor Island Art Fair:</b> <a href=""http://www.4heads.org/governors-island-art-fair/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.4heads.org/governors-island-art-fair/</a><br/>I have been selected to participate in the 9th annual Governors Island Art Fair, organized by 4heads, a New York City nonprofit organization created by artists for artists. Imagine an old army barracks, in which 100 artists have been given rooms to create their own installation. Not only is this an honor, but a unique opportunity to connect my art to the New York art scene. <br/></span></li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Why this event: </b>A piece only becomes “complete” when a viewer connects with it, and it is gratifying when a piece finds someone out in the world, and something alchemical happens, and a circle is created. While I have an excellent following in Ithaca and have had pieces in shows throughout the country, I need to step into the wider art world in a tangible way.

The Artist: http://www.jimgarmhausenart.com/I spent many years as a cartoonist, selling to weekly papers with small successes along the way, and my style reflects that background. There is an emphasis on characters, and particularly faces. The theme of my work, if there is one, comes out of the collective expression of these many characters, and the feeling that pours into them as I let them into the world, line by line. ​I create art because it feels absolutely essential to do so, and to hold back on it creates dark shadows and internal disturbances and has me lurking about in ways that worry people. I am drawn to aged, worn surfaces, and display work in cheap antique framing that gives a sense of a rediscovery of something stored away and forgotten.


Governor Island Art Fair: http://www.4heads.org/governors-island-art-fair/I have been selected to participate in the 9th annual Governors Island Art Fair, organized by 4heads, a New York City nonprofit organization created by artists for artists. Imagine an old army barracks, in which 100 artists have been given rooms to create their own installation. Not only is this an honor, but a unique opportunity to connect my art to the New York art scene. 

Why this event: A piece only becomes “complete” when a viewer connects with it, and it is gratifying when a piece finds someone out in the world, and something alchemical happens, and a circle is created. While I have an excellent following in Ithaca and have had pieces in shows throughout the country, I need to step into the wider art world in a tangible way. Getting to this show will help me take this step.

<p><strong>As one of my friends put it, we have to help the people in our own backyard. So with this in mind I endeavour to buy a Compact Modular prefab container style home for a young family in Brazil. <i>Project 1</i> - Julya is 5 years old and needs a house of her own to grow up in!</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496765667/y5jscox891umk31jklt6.png"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>

<p><strong>This campaign has unlimited potential so if we can raise enough funds we will purchase and install a home for the needy.</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496765823/jmkzc58pwtoirninee5t.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p>First level objective to reach 60K </p>
<p>20K will go to the purchase of a container home for the young family in Brazil</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Second level when we reach 80K </p>
<p>30K will go to build 2 Sustainable container homes in <strong>HAITI</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497802970/vut0zazrifu6ubcxd0kb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Third Level at a 100K</p>
<p>40K will go into acquiring 2 to 3 homes</p>
<p>And so we aim to give back up to 40% of total perks revenue proceeds, so please be generous so we can transmit the message of hope, love and art.</p>
<h3>Art affects off of us and for me it is a passion. Creating is a passion. Seeing an audience get moved by it is so rewarding. All artist need support in order for the creation to continue. Yet Art needs to remain accessible so with this in mind I hope to offer rewards that meet this goal. </h3>
<p>In 2015 I came out with my first edition of FASCINASIA, it needs to be updated to a second edition with a couple of improvements. I also want to publish a book of the new work since that was shown during last years' Miami Art Basel week and all my new mixed media paintings to show and share the continual evolution. It is entitled ""Love is Eternal"".  In addition I have 2 new books I would like to launch based on my travels to special sectors in Brazil: The first being - Sea of Dunes based on the magical, Lençóis Maranhenses National Park. The Second book would be based on my very resent trip to Brasilia - ""Geometric City"".</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The small mission</h3>
<p>Presently I am seeking funds to complete the Book projects. You can see the completed first edition in the Video. You have the option to choose it and get it quickly or hold out until I reach my finding goals to create a Second edition of the book ""FASCINASIA"". Having returned to South East Asia in early 2016 and visited Japan Vietnam, Hong Kong, Singapore,Laos, Myanmar &amp; Thailand I am excited to show my new work and continue the FASCINASIA series with a new book"" Love is Eternal"". I am always delighted to hear such appreciation for my fine art photography so in that spirit I would like to release never published images from the Brazil series in these 2 new books.</p>
<p>My goal is simply to get my vision of reflecting beauty in the world to as many eyes as I can. Extended goals are to bring my next Art show to a city closer to you, so a world tour be a long term goal.  I am always working on new Solo exhibitions and with strong support I can bring my work to major Art fair cites and continue a strong studio practice.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>REWARDS</strong> - Now offering new paintings and photography that in many cases have never been available as limited edition prints are now offered as rewards. Special collector editions of limited print are being made available at special prices that are up to 50% off. </li>
<li>
<strong>PRINTING</strong> - The costs of doing high end books are as high as $70 a piece. So getting a large bulk order can bring the costs down which makes it more accessible.</li>
<li>
<strong>STUDIO</strong> - New materials and running an Atelier to create new pieces $3000 / month basic costs.</li>
<li> <strong>GOAL</strong> - If I reach the goal I will invest in printing as many books as I can so I can do a Book Signing at my next shows. I will also put funds towards the setting up of as many shows as I can pull off in a year. Should I surpass my goal buy a Compact Modular prefab container style home for a young family in Brazil and other countries in need.  I will add other cities to tour my Art, Hong Kong London, Paris, Russia and Dubai could be added to the tour. Should the Goal not be reached I will simply invest in doing the next show and ordering as many books as I can.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It can take many years for an Artist to live well from his craft, ultimately this campaign goes a long way to making that dream come true:</p>
<ul>
<li>Art and culture are important to the human fabric. My supporters are often as passionate as I am about the work. So in order to leave lasting legacy behind for generations to enjoy it require an audience that supports it. </li>
<li>Since 2014 I have had successful Solo Shows in the Miami and realized the Design and printing of my Book of my Asian series entitled FASCINASIA in 2015.</li>
<li>Miami Art Basel 2016 was also a success at the Shore Club Hotel so this year we raise the bar.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Seeing as I have programmed to do 'Print on demand' there is no risk.</p>
<p>The only challenge is to receive enough pledges to pay the design fees and related cost for the other 3 new books, but as it will be based you your selections. I will start where I see there is more orders. Often in production there can be unforeseen delays so that might factor in.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>How can you help other then pledging funds? Spread the word on my work.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make some noise share &amp; forward the campaign.</li>
<li>Send us Sponsors that want to be Branded during the shows!</li>
<li>Get media to notice my work.</li>
<li>Volunteer to help out at one of my shows or installing homes</li>
<li>Become an Art Ambassador </li>
<li>You can become an editor or a collaborating designer of one of the new books</li>

So with this in mind I endeavour to buy a Compact Modular prefab container style home for a young family in Brazil. Project 1 - Julya is 5 years old and needs a house of her own to grow up in!

The big picture mission

This campaign has unlimited potential so if we can raise enough funds we will purchase and install a home for the needy.

First level objective to reach 60K 
20K will go to the purchase of a container home for the young family in Brazil
 
Second level when we reach 80K 
30K will go to build 2 Sustainable container homes in HAITI

 
Third Level at a 100K
40K will go into acquiring 2 to 3 homes
And so we aim to give back up to 40% of total perks revenue proceeds, so please be generous so we can transmit the message of hope, love and art.
Art affects off of us and for me it is a passion. Creating is a passion. Seeing an audience get moved by it is so rewarding. All artist need support in order for the creation to continue. Yet Art needs to remain accessible so with this in mind I hope to offer rewards that meet this goal. 
In 2015 I came out with my first edition of FASCINASIA, it needs to be updated to a second edition with a couple of improvements. I also want to publish a book of the new work since that was shown during last years' Miami Art Basel week and all my new mixed media paintings to show and share the continual evolution. It is entitled ""Love is Eternal"".  In addition I have 2 new books I would like to launch based on my travels to special sectors in Brazil: The first being - Sea of Dunes based on the magical, Lençóis Maranhenses National Park. The Second book would be based on my very resent trip to Brasilia - ""Geometric City"".
 

The small mission
Presently I am seeking funds to complete the Book projects. You can see the completed first edition in the Video. You have the option to choose it and get it quickly or hold out until I reach my finding goals to create a Second edition of the book ""FASCINASIA"". Having returned to South East Asia in early 2016 and visited Japan Vietnam, Hong Kong, Singapore,Laos, Myanmar & Thailand I am excited to show my new work and continue the FASCINASIA series with a new book"" Love is Eternal"". I am always delighted to hear such appreciation for my fine art photography so in that spirit I would like to release never published images from the Brazil series in these 2 new books.
My goal is simply to get my vision of reflecting beauty in the world to as many eyes as I can. Extended goals are to bring my next Art show to a city closer to you, so a world tour be a long term goal.  I am always working on new Solo exhibitions and with strong support I can bring my work to major Art fair cites and continue a strong studio practice.


REWARDS - Now offering new paintings and photography that in many cases have never been available as limited edition prints are now offered as rewards. Special collector editions of limited print are being made available at special prices that are up to 50% off. 

PRINTING - The costs of doing high end books are as high as $70 a piece. So getting a large bulk order can bring the costs down which makes it more accessible.

STUDIO - New materials and running an Atelier to create new pieces $3000 / month basic costs.
 GOAL - If I reach the goal I will invest in printing as many books as I can so I can do a Book Signing at my next shows. I will also put funds towards the setting up of as many shows as I can pull off in a year. Should I surpass my goal buy a Compact Modular prefab container style home for a young family in Brazil and other countries in need.  I will add other cities to tour my Art, Hong Kong London, Paris, Russia and Dubai could be added to the tour. Should the Goal not be reached I will simply invest in doing the next show and ordering as many books as I can.


The Impact
It can take many years for an Artist to live well from his craft, ultimately this campaign goes a long way to making that dream come true:

Art and culture are important to the human fabric. My supporters are often as passionate as I am about the work. So in order to leave lasting legacy behind for generations to enjoy it require an audience that supports it. 
Since 2014 I have had successful Solo Shows in the Miami and realized the Design and printing of my Book of my Asian series entitled FASCINASIA in 2015.
Miami Art Basel 2016 was also a success at the Shore Club Hotel so this year we raise the bar.


Risks & Challenges
Seeing as I have programmed to do 'Print on demand' there is no risk.
The only challenge is to receive enough pledges to pay the design fees and related cost for the other 3 new books, but as it will be based you your selections. I will start where I see there is more orders. Often in production there can be unforeseen delays so that might factor in.

Other Ways You Can Help
How can you help other then pledging funds? Spread the word on my work.

Make some noise share & forward the campaign.

We have worked on many educational projects for kids such as: children's books, puzzles, stickers, journals, posters, apparel, children's magazines, etc. That carries over into our own home where we feel it is important to fill our space with artwork that can help educate as well as beautify.</p><p>To this day we both remember artwork that was up on our classroom walls in school and in our homes. Those visual representations of information help keep those posters cemented in our heads, and we carry that knowledge with us today.

The posters they currently use are either not what they need, outdated, too “young”, not something the students want to look at, or they are stuck making it themselves.

These studies have found a direct link in the aesthetics of a room and the feelings the student has towards education. Unattractive rooms led kids to unhappiness, fatigue, and a desire to escape, where beautiful classrooms led to feelings of confidence and happier kids.

We have worked on many educational projects for kids such as: children's books, puzzles, stickers, journals, posters, apparel, children's magazines, etc. That carries over into our own home where we feel it is important to fill our space with artwork that can help educate as well as beautify.To this day we both remember artwork that was up on our classroom walls in school and in our homes. Those visual representations of information help keep those posters cemented in our heads, and we carry that knowledge with us today. That is something we want our kids to experience, and how we want to help inspire them to learn. We hope to use Artists for Education as a vessel to accomplish that goal.We all remember how uninspiring some of the stock art was in our classrooms growing up. Well it hasn’t become any prettier and is outdated as ever. Why? Because teachers don’t have access to new, well designed art, and it rarely exists in the first place. Not to mention if they do have access, they rarely can afford to get it for their classrooms. The average amount a teacher spends out of pocket for school supplies in their classroom alone is $500.After that, spending money on quality, educational artwork for the classroom is almost out of the question.We surveyed teachers, and found out that there is a huge demand for GOOD posters in classrooms. They need art to explain concepts, use as visual aids, and to inspire students. The posters they currently use are either not what they need, outdated, too “young”, not something the students want to look at, or they are stuck making it themselves. Sure, there are sites that allow teachers to download materials and get ideas, but what they need and deserve is well designed, beautiful posters for their classrooms to help educate and inspire their students.Think of a teacher that has impacted your life. This could be a past teacher of yours, a family member, or a friend. Everyone has a teacher in their life that could use our help!90% of the brain’s sensory input is from visual sources, and visual memory takes up two thirds of the brain. Researchers have even found that unconscious learning can take place through exposure to information on a poster. This means that students in the back of the room who don’t seem to be paying attention, can actually learn from the posters on the classroom wall.Currently, art that is in schools is sometimes not as effective at catching the student’s attention as it could be. It may not seem that it matters how good the posters look, as long as the information on them is accurate, but that is not true. Since the 50’s many studies have been done on the effect of visually attractive classrooms on students. These studies have found a direct link in the aesthetics of a room and the feelings the student has towards education. Unattractive rooms led kids to unhappiness, fatigue, and a desire to escape, where beautiful classrooms led to feelings of confidence and happier kids. These emotions have an effect on student’s attendance, behavior, class participation, and relationship with their teachers.Posters are also been proven to improve comprehension, increase retention, enhance retrieval and even decrease the amount of time it takes a student to learn a concept.The bottom lIne: Posters are effective learning tools in a classroom!We currently have a huge group of incredibly talented and generous artists on our team that are creating posters and submitting content. The work that these artists have done so far has blown us away, and we know it is going to be a wonderful asset in classrooms! Here is a sneak peak of just a few of the submissions so far: *Artists Top left to right: Josh Lewis, Andrew Kolb, Brave the Woods, Scott Fuller, Ben Stafford, Corey CarboBy supporting us now in the early stages, you are helping us get Artists for Education off the ground floor. Your financial support will help us create and print posters, market the company so we can get it out to as many educators as possible, run events to raise more funds for education, and will help us fund classroom makeovers. We can revolutionize classroom art together!   *Artists top left to right: Fred Rodriguez, Lydia Nichols, Shauna Panczyszyn, Brave the Woods, Mary Kate McDevitt If you can’t contribute today, please spread the word to those who can and to the teacher’s in your life that need support! Thank you, from our family and the Artists for Education team!",21.0,0,"1 Campaign

An easy to learn method of communication that relies solely on the use of the facial expressions, FaceComm has an enormous range of applications, from Speech Therapy, Education, for use in the Military and Secret Services, and even as a form of entertainment. With your help, we will maximize the full potential of FaceComm, and develop course materials and videos so that this revolutionary language can be taught and learned all around the world.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b><br/></b></p><p style=""text-align: left;""><b>FaceComm – What Is It?</b></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">FaceComm stands for ‘Facial Communication.’ It is a completely unique form of language, developed by Indian Innovator Dr. Sharad Gandhi, and performed by his brother Mr. Bharat Gandhi. Developed and researched intensely over a period of fifteen years, FaceComm is a silent language that is entirely visual in nature, requiring no verbal speech. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">To achieve this, it makes use of a diverse range of facial expressions to convey all types of information with depth, meaning, and acuity. Approximately half of the communication is achieved by movement and expression of the eyes alone; the rest involves full usage of the cheeks, lips, ears, eyebrows, and tongue. Because it is a non-verbal language, it can be adapted to suit any native language. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">There is nothing arbitrary about FaceComm – there is a very definite logic and algorithm governing its workings; meaning that precise and complex meaning can be conveyed with absolute accuracy. Possessing its own script, grammar, and lexicon, it is a truly universal language. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b><br/></b></p><p style=""text-align: left;""><b>How Was it Developed?</b></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Dr. Sharad Gandhi first hit upon the impulse for FaceComm at the precocious age of twelve. Gifted with a naturally curious mind, he asked himself the pressing question: “How did people communicate with one another before the origination of the spoken word?” Finding no satisfactory answers from his peers or in the annals of history, Dr. Gandhi began to invent an entirely facial language, free from the constraints of sound or audio transmission. Over time, FaceComm continued to be expanded, refined and improved. Like any other language, FaceComm is a living, dynamic medium, and is being enlarged and fine-tuned every day in its scope of application and practice. The suggestions we will list here regarding its potential use is just scratching the surface. Its full power is limitless.</p><br/><p style=""text-align: left;""><b>A Universal Language</b></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Because FaceComm requires no actual physical speech, it has the immense virtue of being one of the world’s few truly silent languages. Not only does this make it a wonderful alternative or adjunct to sign language, but it also makes it a lucrative investment for anyone working in an industry in which secrecy and silence are essential.  This would make FaceComm a potentially invaluable resource to anyone working in the military, police department, secret services, or any governmental agency in which coded information is necessary part of protocol.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Let’s take a look now at a few of the most promising applications of FaceComm:</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b><br/></b></p><p style=""text-align: left;""><b>Sign Language</b></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">For those incapable of speech or hearing, whether congenitally, or as a consequence to illness or trauma, sign language provides those without a voice a means by which they can express themselves. However, many sign languages are deficient. There is an element of guesswork to a lot of sign languages, and as a result, precision and clarity in understanding is often found wanting. It is also unavailable to people who may not have full control over their limbs.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Because FaceComm functions on its own logical algorithms, and possesses its own grammar, lexicon, and syntax, many of these deficits can be corrected and repaired. By using FaceComm alone or in conjunction with existing methods, we can dramatically increase the range and depth of communication available to the vocally and auditorily challenged.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> It can also be a useful form of speech therapy for anyone suffering from paralysis or debilitation of the limbs, as is seen in various types of motor-neurone disease, paralysis, or as consequence of stroke or other traumas. FaceComm could be the only opportunity for communication available to vulnerable people who may have no other means of expressing themselves.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b><br/></b></p><p style=""text-align: left;""><b>Education and Speech Therapy</b></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">FaceComm has a lot to offer the education establishment. Fun to learn and easy to use, children and adults will both delight in its ability to expand their range of self-expression. By adding motor function and visualization to their understanding of language, it will deepen their understanding of communication, and enrich their ability to relate to other people and make friends. By sharing FaceComm with another person as a secret language, it can deepen the connection and intimacy we feel with others, and refine our sensitivity to the human experience. The subject could be studied by those who wish to specialize in non-verbal communication, or make a career in the medical or care industries. It could also be offered as a form of speech therapy to people who struggle with dyslexia, or lack confidence in expressing themselves verbally.</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><b><br/></b></p><p style=""text-align: left;""><b>Military</b></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Warfare and other military operations are by nature extremely sensitive and dangerous procedures. Good communication within military units is essential for maintaining cohesion and order in chaotic scenarios, and for minimizing loss of life on both sides. FaceComm would be a useful means of silent communication between soldiers during situations in which making noise might alert them to nearby enemies and cost them their lives. It could also be used to transmit sensitive vital information over large stretches of land via telescope, binoculars, or smartphone, without any fear of it being intercepted or understood by enemy forces. Teaching soldiers a shared secret language would increase their sense of brotherhood, and hence maximize their togetherness and bravery in strategic operations and battles.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Similar applications could also be adapted to suit the police force and other defense industries.</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><b><br/></b></p><p style=""text-align: left;""><b>Secret Services</b></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">In the Secret Service sector, the encryption of sensitive information and state secrets is critically important. What better way to keep classified information under wraps than the use of a silent language that no opposing secret agent or enemy of the state will readily be able to interpret or decode? FaceComm provides a means by which secret agents would be able to converse with one another in public without arousing suspicion, as well as in more delicate or dangerous scenarios. The same is true with regards to politicians, FBI agents, or bodyguards, who may need to communicate portentous messages in public or via Skype or other media without seeming unusual to outside parties. Because of FaceComm’s great precision, accuracy, and ever-expanding dictionary, complex and intricate messages can be transmitted without any fear of misinterpretation by the receiving party.  Through the miracle of FaceComm, a secret agent could use their lips to say one thing and their face another.</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><b><br/></b></p><p style=""text-align: left;""><b>Space Exploration</b></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Space communication among astronauts is still at the mercy of electronic equipments equipped in space-suits. So in case of any accident or a critical emergency, astronauts are reluctant to communicate through hand signals. Under such circumstances, FaceComm's visual communication could serve as a boon for them. Using just facial expressions, the whole crew would be able to brain-storm through critical situations quickly and act upon solutions rapidly without the need of a single instrument. This is the true potential of FaceComm which we are striving to unleash!</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><br/></p><p style=""text-align: left;""><b>Conclusion</b></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">As stated above, we are just scratching the surface of the potential benefits that FaceComm has to offer to the world. But to summarize, here are some of the most salient benefits:</p><ul>
<li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">An improved means of communication for the deaf, dumb, or vocally-inhibited</p></li>
<li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The potential to save lives in crises, disasters, or war zones in which verbal communication is not always an option</p></li>
<li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Speech therapy for the dyslexic or unconfident</p></li>
<li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The safeguarding and transmission of classified information by those working in the defense or secret service industries</p></li>
<li><p>Improved communication and minimization of casualties in war zones</p></li>
<li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">A conveniently shared secret language for members of the same organization; police, medical professionals, politicians, security guards, lawyers, members of secret organizations, musicians, and people working in noisy atmospheres unconducive to spoken conversations</p></li>
<li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">As a beneficial course of study for those specializing in non-verbal languages, cross-cultural communication, and the care and medical and industries</p></li>
<li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">And for the simple fun and delight of changing our way of thinking and experiencing the nature of language and the human experience</p></li>

An easy to learn method of communication that relies solely on the use of the facial expressions, FaceComm has an enormous range of applications, from Speech Therapy, Education, for use in the Military and Secret Services, and even as a form of entertainment. With your help, we will maximize the full potential of FaceComm, and develop course materials and videos so that this revolutionary language can be taught and learned all around the world.FaceComm – What Is It?FaceComm stands for ‘Facial Communication.’ It is a completely unique form of language, developed by Indian Innovator Dr. Sharad Gandhi, and performed by his brother Mr. Bharat Gandhi. Developed and researched intensely over a period of fifteen years, FaceComm is a silent language that is entirely visual in nature, requiring no verbal speech. To achieve this, it makes use of a diverse range of facial expressions to convey all types of information with depth, meaning, and acuity. Approximately half of the communication is achieved by movement and expression of the eyes alone; the rest involves full usage of the cheeks, lips, ears, eyebrows, and tongue. Because it is a non-verbal language, it can be adapted to suit any native language. There is nothing arbitrary about FaceComm – there is a very definite logic and algorithm governing its workings; meaning that precise and complex meaning can be conveyed with absolute accuracy. Possessing its own script, grammar, and lexicon, it is a truly universal language. How Was it Developed?Dr. Sharad Gandhi first hit upon the impulse for FaceComm at the precocious age of twelve. Gifted with a naturally curious mind, he asked himself the pressing question: “How did people communicate with one another before the origination of the spoken word?” Finding no satisfactory answers from his peers or in the annals of history, Dr. Gandhi began to invent an entirely facial language, free from the constraints of sound or audio transmission. Over time, FaceComm continued to be expanded, refined and improved. Like any other language, FaceComm is a living, dynamic medium, and is being enlarged and fine-tuned every day in its scope of application and practice. The suggestions we will list here regarding its potential use is just scratching the surface. Its full power is limitless.A Universal LanguageBecause FaceComm requires no actual physical speech, it has the immense virtue of being one of the world’s few truly silent languages. Not only does this make it a wonderful alternative or adjunct to sign language, but it also makes it a lucrative investment for anyone working in an industry in which secrecy and silence are essential.  This would make FaceComm a potentially invaluable resource to anyone working in the military, police department, secret services, or any governmental agency in which coded information is necessary part of protocol.Let’s take a look now at a few of the most promising applications of FaceComm:Sign LanguageFor those incapable of speech or hearing, whether congenitally, or as a consequence to illness or trauma, sign language provides those without a voice a means by which they can express themselves. However, many sign languages are deficient. There is an element of guesswork to a lot of sign languages, and as a result, precision and clarity in understanding is often found wanting. It is also unavailable to people who may not have full control over their limbs.Because FaceComm functions on its own logical algorithms, and possesses its own grammar, lexicon, and syntax, many of these deficits can be corrected and repaired. By using FaceComm alone or in conjunction with existing methods, we can dramatically increase the range and depth of communication available to the vocally and auditorily challenged. It can also be a useful form of speech therapy for anyone suffering from paralysis or debilitation of the limbs, as is seen in various types of motor-neurone disease, paralysis, or as consequence of stroke or other traumas. FaceComm could be the only opportunity for communication available to vulnerable people who may have no other means of expressing themselves.Education and Speech TherapyFaceComm has a lot to offer the education establishment. Fun to learn and easy to use, children and adults will both delight in its ability to expand their range of self-expression. By adding motor function and visualization to their understanding of language, it will deepen their understanding of communication, and enrich their ability to relate to other people and make friends. By sharing FaceComm with another person as a secret language, it can deepen the connection and intimacy we feel with others, and refine our sensitivity to the human experience. The subject could be studied by those who wish to specialize in non-verbal communication, or make a career in the medical or care industries. It could also be offered as a form of speech therapy to people who struggle with dyslexia, or lack confidence in expressing themselves verbally.MilitaryWarfare and other military operations are by nature extremely sensitive and dangerous procedures. Good communication within military units is essential for maintaining cohesion and order in chaotic scenarios, and for minimizing loss of life on both sides. FaceComm would be a useful means of silent communication between soldiers during situations in which making noise might alert them to nearby enemies and cost them their lives. It could also be used to transmit sensitive vital information over large stretches of land via telescope, binoculars, or smartphone, without any fear of it being intercepted or understood by enemy forces. Teaching soldiers a shared secret language would increase their sense of brotherhood, and hence maximize their togetherness and bravery in strategic operations and battles.Similar applications could also be adapted to suit the police force and other defense industries.Secret ServicesIn the Secret Service sector, the encryption of sensitive information and state secrets is critically important. What better way to keep classified information under wraps than the use of a silent language that no opposing secret agent or enemy of the state will readily be able to interpret or decode? FaceComm provides a means by which secret agents would be able to converse with one another in public without arousing suspicion, as well as in more delicate or dangerous scenarios. The same is true with regards to politicians, FBI agents, or bodyguards, who may need to communicate portentous messages in public or via Skype or other media without seeming unusual to outside parties. Because of FaceComm’s great precision, accuracy, and ever-expanding dictionary, complex and intricate messages can be transmitted without any fear of misinterpretation by the receiving party.  Through the miracle of FaceComm, a secret agent could use their lips to say one thing and their face another.Space ExplorationSpace communication among astronauts is still at the mercy of electronic equipments equipped in space-suits. So in case of any accident or a critical emergency, astronauts are reluctant to communicate through hand signals. Under such circumstances, FaceComm's visual communication could serve as a boon for them. Using just facial expressions, the whole crew would be able to brain-storm through critical situations quickly and act upon solutions rapidly without the need of a single instrument. This is the true potential of FaceComm which we are striving to unleash!ConclusionAs stated above, we are just scratching the surface of the potential benefits that FaceComm has to offer to the world. But to summarize, here are some of the most salient benefits:
An improved means of communication for the deaf, dumb, or vocally-inhibited
The potential to save lives in crises, disasters, or war zones in which verbal communication is not always an option
Speech therapy for the dyslexic or unconfident
The safeguarding and transmission of classified information by those working in the defense or secret service industries
Improved communication and minimization of casualties in war zones
A conveniently shared secret language for members of the same organization; police, medical professionals, politicians, security guards, lawyers, members of secret organizations, musicians, and people working in noisy atmospheres unconducive to spoken conversations
As a beneficial course of study for those specializing in non-verbal languages, cross-cultural communication, and the care and medical and industries
And for the simple fun and delight of changing our way of thinking and experiencing the nature of language and the human experience

<h3>Summary 
</h3>
<p>What is your favorite day of the week?</p>
<p>Where do our days of the week come from?</p>
<p>What do the days mean to <i>you</i>?</p>
<p>My forthcoming book, The Order of the Days, will explore the rich history of our days of the week, and will illustrate that history with the help of seven phenomenal artists.</p>
<p>The week we follow is more than 2,000 years old. It was born in the Hellenistic empire of Alexander the Great, and rooted in the ancient, mystical, and polytheistic cultures of Egypt, Babylon, and Greece. Eventually, the week fused with the Hebrew and Christian traditions, ensuring a cultural stronghold that stands to this day.</p>
<p>Long ago, the days were named after the planets, and in turn, the deities associated with those planets. Although slightly altered through time, those names remain. Why is Wednesday named after Woden, the Anglo-Saxon god of wisdom? How has Saturn maintained a presence in Saturday, despite centuries of assimilation?<span style=""font-size: 14px;line-height: 20px;""> </span><span>The Order of the Days will suggest that it could benefit us all, in very practical ways, to consider the source of that naming.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Beyond an interesting nomenclature, and litany of deities, this book will explore ancient memory systems, which developed contemporaneously with the week. Mnemonics (memory tricks) were employed by classical thinkers, such as Cicero, in order to retain vast amounts of knowledge for oration. These mnemonics were then inherited by medieval theologians, like Thomas Aquinas, who used them in order to indoctrinate the masses with complex Church teachings. Finally, the memory tradition was adopted by Renaissance astrologers, alchemists, magicians, and occultists, like Cornelius Agrippa. Agrippa, for example, used the systems in order to convey mystical knowledge about the planets, celestial powers, and intricate associations, which ranged from the stones to the stars. <br/></p>
<p>The Order of the Days will explore the symbiotic relationship between the genesis of our week and these ancient mnemonics. Not only may it be terribly practical to utilize the week as a memory system, but it could also be extremely useful to consider which--if any--of the days' ancient associations still resonate in our own relationships with the week. <br/></p>
<p>This campaign and this book are important to me because I believe that we can all learn something about ourselves, and how to make each day more meaningful, through the examination of a weekly system that most of us take for granted. In fact, each day is worth celebrating.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In the end, this project will yield an informative, modestly-sized, and functional art book. Descriptions of historical circumstances and mystical characters will fill its pages, but the focus will be on seven pieces of original art. The text will simply put the images into context, and suggest ways to make the striking images useful on a personal level.<br/></p>
<p>In order to make this book a reality, I am collaborating with seven of my favorite artists. Each artist will create one image, inspired by the ancient characters and correspondences associated with each day.<br/></p>

</div><div>Each one of these talented individuals is a professional working artist, and I want to be sure that they are compensated for their contribution to this project. To that end, I have set a campaign goal of $4,000 to be divided among the seven, with $500 left over for production costs (i.e. paying a graphic designer for book layout, promotional materials, and the printing of a small run of the book to be sold at a book release event).<br/><br/>If the entire goal is not met, funds will still be divided those eight ways. However, if you take a moment to investigate the above websites, I think you will agree that these artists are worth every penny of the desired goal.<br/><br/>
</div><div>At the very least, no matter what your level of support, a donation will guarantee you a personal thank you in the book. With a higher level of contribution, you can expect your own autographed copy of the book, signed prints from your days of choice, and other exciting rewards.<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Your Impact</h3>
<p>By contributing to this campaign, you are helping to excavate and artistically represent a more than 2,000 year old tradition. What does it really mean when you call each day by name? What has it meant to so many people though the centuries? The Order of the Days aims to foster an informed and aesthetically stimulating perspective on a week that is packed with ancient history and mystery.<br/></p>
<p>My first book, Lycaon: The Story of the First Werewolf (a collaboration with artist, Liz Emirzian), has been on sale online via Amazon, Barnes &amp; Noble, and at The Museum of Modern Art in NYC for the past three years. I hope for a similar--if not expanded--course for The Order of the Days.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>Rise to the Challenge</h3> <p>In all of my creative endeavors, I take great pleasure in bringing people together. Every collaboration is special, and I am thrilled to join forces with seven exceptional artists. Capturing the essence of hundreds of years of history in one image is certainly a challenge, but I have complete faith that each of my collaborators will rise to the occasion. Their own unique aesthetics and methods will inform the unique character of each day. </p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>I invite you to be a part of this campaign and this book. Whatever amount you can contribute will be greatly appreciated, and rewards will come your way. If you cannot afford to contribute, but still want to help bring this book to life, please make some noise. Share links on your favorite platform, and help spread the word about a project that can have a daily impact on each of us.</p>
<p>Have a wonderful day,</p>
<p>Brendan</p>

What is your favorite day of the week?
Where do our days of the week come from?
What do the days mean to you?
My forthcoming book, The Order of the Days, will explore the rich history of our days of the week, and will illustrate that history with the help of seven phenomenal artists.
The week we follow is more than 2,000 years old. It was born in the Hellenistic empire of Alexander the Great, and rooted in the ancient, mystical, and polytheistic cultures of Egypt, Babylon, and Greece. Eventually, the week fused with the Hebrew and Christian traditions, ensuring a cultural stronghold that stands to this day.
Long ago, the days were named after the planets, and in turn, the deities associated with those planets. Although slightly altered through time, those names remain. Why is Wednesday named after Woden, the Anglo-Saxon god of wisdom? How has Saturn maintained a presence in Saturday, despite centuries of assimilation? The Order of the Days will suggest that it could benefit us all, in very practical ways, to consider the source of that naming.


Beyond an interesting nomenclature, and litany of deities, this book will explore ancient memory systems, which developed contemporaneously with the week. Mnemonics (memory tricks) were employed by classical thinkers, such as Cicero, in order to retain vast amounts of knowledge for oration. These mnemonics were then inherited by medieval theologians, like Thomas Aquinas, who used them in order to indoctrinate the masses with complex Church teachings. Finally, the memory tradition was adopted by Renaissance astrologers, alchemists, magicians, and occultists, like Cornelius Agrippa. Agrippa, for example, used the systems in order to convey mystical knowledge about the planets, celestial powers, and intricate associations, which ranged from the stones to the stars. 
The Order of the Days will explore the symbiotic relationship between the genesis of our week and these ancient mnemonics. Not only may it be terribly practical to utilize the week as a memory system, but it could also be extremely useful to consider which--if any--of the days' ancient associations still resonate in our own relationships with the week. 
This campaign and this book are important to me because I believe that we can all learn something about ourselves, and how to make each day more meaningful, through the examination of a weekly system that most of us take for granted. In fact, each day is worth celebrating.   What We Need & What You Get
In the end, this project will yield an informative, modestly-sized, and functional art book. Descriptions of historical circumstances and mystical characters will fill its pages, but the focus will be on seven pieces of original art. The text will simply put the images into context, and suggest ways to make the striking images useful on a personal level.
In order to make this book a reality, I am collaborating with seven of my favorite artists. Each artist will create one image, inspired by the ancient characters and correspondences associated with each day.
Here is the team:Saturday - www.SarahZar.com
Sunday - www.AnitaRundles.com
Monday - www.LizEmirzian.com
Tuesday - www.EliseMesnard.com
Wednesday - www.AyaRosen.com
Thursday - www.IgorGnedo.com
Friday - www.JustinNissley.com
Each one of these talented individuals is a professional working artist, and I want to be sure that they are compensated for their contribution to this project. To that end, I have set a campaign goal of $4,000 to be divided among the seven, with $500 left over for production costs (i.e. paying a graphic designer for book layout, promotional materials, and the printing of a small run of the book to be sold at a book release event).If the entire goal is not met, funds will still be divided those eight ways. However, if you take a moment to investigate the above websites, I think you will agree that these artists are worth every penny of the desired goal.
At the very least, no matter what your level of support, a donation will guarantee you a personal thank you in the book. With a higher level of contribution, you can expect your own autographed copy of the book, signed prints from your days of choice, and other exciting rewards.
  Your Impact
By contributing to this campaign, you are helping to excavate and artistically represent a more than 2,000 year old tradition. What does it really mean when you call each day by name? What has it meant to so many people though the centuries? The Order of the Days aims to foster an informed and aesthetically stimulating perspective on a week that is packed with ancient history and mystery.
My first book, Lycaon: The Story of the First Werewolf (a collaboration with artist, Liz Emirzian), has been on sale online via Amazon, Barnes & Noble, and at The Museum of Modern Art in NYC for the past three years. I hope for a similar--if not expanded--course for The Order of the Days.
  Rise to the Challenge In all of my creative endeavors, I take great pleasure in bringing people together. Every collaboration is special, and I am thrilled to join forces with seven exceptional artists. Capturing the essence of hundreds of years of history in one image is certainly a challenge, but I have complete faith that each of my collaborators will rise to the occasion. Their own unique aesthetics and methods will inform the unique character of each day. 
  Other Ways You Can Help I invite you to be a part of this campaign and this book. Whatever amount you can contribute will be greatly appreciated, and rewards will come your way. If you cannot afford to contribute, but still want to help bring this book to life, please make some noise. Share links on your favorite platform, and help spread the word about a project that can have a daily impact on each of us.
Have a wonderful day,

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Donna Augustin. I am a British actress, writer, and producer who lives and works in Brooklyn, New York. I have successfully produced a critically acclaimed theater play, Shoot 2 Win, and two comedic web series: The Show for the BBC and Dirty Laundry.  My short film, Magpie Sings the Blues, starring Javone Prince and Noma Dumezweni, was selected for the 2014 Black Urban Film Festival in London.  In addition to Bodega! I'm currently workshopping a one-woman show entitled ""Mother, New York &amp; Men.""</p>
<p>I believe all people want to feel validated regardless of one's income level, race, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, or religious belief. My interest in analyzing this belief via film is to bring about important, meaningful discussions for us to gain a deeper understanding of each other.  </p>
<p>You can be a part of this discussion! Your help, no matter how small, will help us make the best film we can! There’s no doubt that making a good film is costly. I feel it is worth every ounce of hard work because it will be riveting, and will join the ranks of other thought-provoking films within the corridors of film festivals.  My vision includes implementing the film into community organizations throughout the country, allowing the opportunity to underscore problems, enact conversations, and share feelings around the growing social impact of gentrification. The potential to impact people’s lives- to touch and allow them to speak about this issue from all perspectives -- is substantial. With your generous and thoughtful contributions, all of this will be made possible.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Join me by helping to fund this awesome project-100% of funds raised will go to making this film! Indeed, I have a great script and crew, and will cast talented actors, but I need your help getting this film made and placed in the hands of the right people. It will cost $15,000 to move the film into production. The funds will be allocated according to the following:</p>
<p>1. Cast and crew compensation</p>
<p>2. Rehearsal space for actors, location costs, and permits</p>
<p>3. Make-up, hair, and set design</p>
<p>4. Equipment rental -- Camera package, lighting, location, and sound recording equipment.</p>
<p>5. Post production -- editing, sound design, and grading.</p>
<p>Our creative team is passionate, diverse, connected, and experienced enough to get this project to the finish line: with a little help from you, of course!  However, if I do not reach my $15,000 fundraising goal, I will use whatever funds raised to shoot the film over two days instead of three, or I will find another way to pay for a portion of the production costs. </p>
<p>As previously stated, Bodega! will be submitted to a number of reputable film festivals around the world and will also be used as a tool for community outreach to embolden discussions regarding gentrification. The costs of festival submissions fees, postal costs, and dvd re-productions of the film will also be covered within the fundraising goal.</p>
<p>In return, we are going to put some swag in your life!</p>
<h3>What you get</h3>
<p>We see you as a partner in the film and want to make you a part of this experience. In exchange for your help, we are dishing out (1) a walk on-role on the film, (2) a lifestyle photo shoot in your home, (3) and a work of art from contemporary artist Nathaniel Mary Quinn!  Check out all of the cool prizes to the right and join the Bodega! fam!</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It is somewhat difficult to express the full scope of this conversation. According to the 2015 State of New York City’s Housing and Neighborhoods, the city has seen alarming increases in rent, stagnating incomes, a rise in the number of people paying more for housing than they can afford and other significant demographic shifts in the 21st century. These changes are magnified in the city’s gentrifying neighborhoods.</p>

</div><p> </p></div>","Short Summary
My name is Donna Augustin. I am a British actress, writer, and producer who lives and works in Brooklyn, New York. I have successfully produced a critically acclaimed theater play, Shoot 2 Win, and two comedic web series: The Show for the BBC and Dirty Laundry.  My short film, Magpie Sings the Blues, starring Javone Prince and Noma Dumezweni, was selected for the 2014 Black Urban Film Festival in London.  In addition to Bodega! I'm currently workshopping a one-woman show entitled ""Mother, New York & Men.""
I believe all people want to feel validated regardless of one's income level, race, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, or religious belief. My interest in analyzing this belief via film is to bring about important, meaningful discussions for us to gain a deeper understanding of each other.  
You can be a part of this discussion! Your help, no matter how small, will help us make the best film we can! There’s no doubt that making a good film is costly. I feel it is worth every ounce of hard work because it will be riveting, and will join the ranks of other thought-provoking films within the corridors of film festivals.  My vision includes implementing the film into community organizations throughout the country, allowing the opportunity to underscore problems, enact conversations, and share feelings around the growing social impact of gentrification. The potential to impact people’s lives- to touch and allow them to speak about this issue from all perspectives -- is substantial. With your generous and thoughtful contributions, all of this will be made possible.

What We Need & What You Get
Join me by helping to fund this awesome project-100% of funds raised will go to making this film! Indeed, I have a great script and crew, and will cast talented actors, but I need your help getting this film made and placed in the hands of the right people. It will cost $15,000 to move the film into production. The funds will be allocated according to the following:
1. Cast and crew compensation
2. Rehearsal space for actors, location costs, and permits
3. Make-up, hair, and set design
4. Equipment rental -- Camera package, lighting, location, and sound recording equipment.
5. Post production -- editing, sound design, and grading.
Our creative team is passionate, diverse, connected, and experienced enough to get this project to the finish line: with a little help from you, of course!  However, if I do not reach my $15,000 fundraising goal, I will use whatever funds raised to shoot the film over two days instead of three, or I will find another way to pay for a portion of the production costs. 
As previously stated, Bodega! will be submitted to a number of reputable film festivals around the world and will also be used as a tool for community outreach to embolden discussions regarding gentrification. The costs of festival submissions fees, postal costs, and dvd re-productions of the film will also be covered within the fundraising goal.
In return, we are going to put some swag in your life!
What you get
We see you as a partner in the film and want to make you a part of this experience. In exchange for your help, we are dishing out (1) a walk on-role on the film, (2) a lifestyle photo shoot in your home, (3) and a work of art from contemporary artist Nathaniel Mary Quinn!  Check out all of the cool prizes to the right and join the Bodega! fam!
The Impact
It is somewhat difficult to express the full scope of this conversation. According to the 2015 State of New York City’s Housing and Neighborhoods, the city has seen alarming increases in rent, stagnating incomes, a rise in the number of people paying more for housing than they can afford and other significant demographic shifts in the 21st century. These changes are magnified in the city’s gentrifying neighborhoods.
My contention surrounds the discussion of whether we want New York City to be the home of only the upper middle class and the rich.  Bankers and wealth managers have the right to live in Bedford-Stuyvesant, for example, but their relocation to Brooklyn should not disarm the vitality of artists, singers, performers, educators, and single-parent households. The mix of diverse people living together in New York City and the surrounding boroughs makes the city great; in fact, this diversity actually attracts the bankers and wealth managers. Gentrification seems to impose a lack of respect for diversity. However, there may be opposing views to this position, which happens to be the beauty of Bodega!  Disagreements are welcomed and democracy is upheld.  
This is my second short film. It is the fifth project in which I’ve both produced and acted. Women and people of color have played the leading roles in most of my projects; Bodega! is no different. The theater play I produced, ""Shoot 2 Win,"" garnered positive reviews.  ""Magpie Sings the Blues,"" my last short film, was screened at several venues in England. This will be my directorial debut, and I am both excited and honored to be shooting such a powerful film. 

Risks & Challenges
Shooting films- and any production- can be challenging.  There can be technical problems or issues with post-production. My goal is to face these challenges directly, whatever they are, in a manner equivalent to that of my previous productions: with professionalism, great tact, and a sound plan. 

Other Ways You Can Help
Any donation, of any size, is appreciated. However, if you cannot donate, then I completely understand. I am equally grateful to anyone who can tweet my fundraising campaign, post my campaign on Facebook, Instagram, or Tumblr, or who can spread the word to friends and family members about the campaign.  Remember, using the ""share tools"" will be just as helpful for my project. In the words of Stevie Wonder, ""Teamwork makes the dream work!""
And, of course, there is no greater way to show your support for my project than coming to see the film once it is completed. I hope to see you there!

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1505677835/x0hgf0fcyssdcnx40mpb.jpg"" src=""""/> </p>
<p>  My love for glass began as a child watching a glassblower create works of art at a community folk festival. I was intrigued by how a blob of molten glass could be crafted into anything the artist could dream of. As an adult my love for glass magnified. I did hours of extensive research about working with glass and how to build my own work space. One day, by chance, I came across someone selling their entire glass studio and I jumped at the chance to start my flameworking adventures and make my dreams become a reality. With the help of my wife, we turned a small corner of our garage into a place where creative ideas came to life. We spent hundreds of hours creating beautiful pendants, ornaments, and unique pieces of glass art. Almost three years after our adventure began our lives were negatively impacted by some major hardships. We had to make the tough decision to part ways with our studio. After the studio was gone we felt its loss keenly. We realized how vitally important glass working was to us and we made the decision to pursue it again as soon as we were able.  Being without a glass studio I had no creative outlet anymore. It really is true what they say, ""You don't know what you have until it's gone.""</p>
<p>  With a little under three years of hands-on experience I know exactly what is needed to build and safely outfit a studio for creating unique handcrafted pieces of glass art. Weeks of work went into just the design of our new studio. With my better half, Kristen, we have created a space where Flamekeeper Studios can help us not just to grow as artists but to thrive. Together we have done the hard part of building an entire studio space from the ground up for the last three months. We have the barest of necessities to begin our studio work, such as a torch and kiln. We need your help to finish outfitting our studio with several other important components such as ventilation, fuel tanks, glass, and tools. </p>
<p>  We are highly motivated to bring Flamekeeper Studios to life. Even if our goal of $6000 is not met, Flamekeeper Studios will still eventually open but it will take at least another long year before it is finally completed. Your support will help turn the dream of opening Flamkeeper Studios into an accelerated reality.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Fortunately, we own our studio space and some of the major equipment needed to start creating, including a kiln and a torch. Below is a list of what we still need to set up a successful, safe, and productive studio:</p>
<ul>
<li>Professionally installed Ventilation system (draws out the toxic fumes when melting glass)</li>
<li>A door and a new window for the studio</li>
<li>Fuel/Oxygen tanks, Regulators and Fuel lines (without these we have no flame)</li>
<li>Clear/Colored glass (rods, frit, and tubes)</li>
<li>Various hand tools for working hot glass</li>
<li>Packaging/Shipping Materials</li>
</ul>
<p>If we are able to meet our goal of $6000, we are more than happy to give back a little something to those who donated to our campaign. Think of it as pre-ordering our art! Check out the incentives on the right-hand margin.</p>
<p>If we are able to surpass our goal, we will be able to purchase extra equipment, such as extra storage cabinets for glass, photo/lighting equipment, and cold-working equipment, among various other things.</p>

<p>(This is what our studio currently looks like. We wanted a creative space to work in so we went with a beehive theme to break up the plain walls.)</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As up and coming artists, it is crucial to have a space to make our work. Without the essential items above, we would have no way of working safely, let alone a way to produce our glass art. Renting a studio can cost anywhere from $250 (a low estimate) to $600 per month for glass artists in the Lehigh Valley. We would rather save our money and pour it into creating a space to grow on our own terms. A glassblowing studio is a place for us to make our work, and bring our ideas to life. We plan to do live glassblowing demos, and build with our local community of Whitehall PA.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Since we own and are not renting the space, the risks associated with funding our campaign are pretty minimal. One of the biggest risks we face is not gathering enough funding. If the campaign does not raise $6000, then it will take us a lot longer to build our studio. Our goal, with your help, is to have it up and running by the end of this year. However, minus adequate funding, that goal will probably take until the summer of 2018--at minimum.</p>
<p>Once the ventilation is installed, and the fuel lines are in place, the only things left to do are buy the rest of the necessary equipment and get the space ""studio ready,"" which will include organizing glass, installing the new window and door, and performing the necessary safety checks. Other than that, we're good to go!</p>

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p><strong>Q. When will I receive my perks?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> You will receive your gift in March of 2018. We need enough time to set up the studio and settle in before we start making your pieces! Please note that the colors and style of the pieces will vary. Each piece is handmade making them one of a kind!</p>
<p><strong>Q.Why do you need ventilation?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. </strong>Ventilation is one of the most important pieces of equipment in a glass studio. Melting glass creates toxic fumes. There are many metallic elements in colored and clear glass. Running a propane/oxygen torch in a room by itself can create various gaseous forms of nitrogen/oxygen compounds, one of which turns into nitric-acid when in the presence of water (say in your lungs). Prolonged exposure to any of these elements is very bad news (anywhere from heavy metal poisoning to risk of inhaling glass dust, even cancer)</p>
<p><strong>Q. What other things do you make?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. </strong>We make a variety of items including pendants, marbles, magnets, figurines, shot glasses, and so much more. The fact is there are endless options when it comes to what you can create with glass. If you are interested in seeing more of our glass art you can follow us on either Instagram or Facebook. </p>

<p><strong>Q. How durable are your pendants and icicles?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. </strong>We use borosilicate glass (better known as Pyrex glass)  for everything we make. Borosilicate glass is known for being pretty strong. When it is annealed correctly it is even stronger. We use our kiln to properly anneal each piece we make taking the stress out of the glass and essentially making it stronger but keep in mind it is still glass, and it is not indestructible.</p>

In order to successfully self-publish I need to order in large quantities and this campaign will raise the funds needed for me to pay for the first order! I have selected two vendors to manufacture the product, they are both located in the United States, and I feel good about working with them.</p><p>My friends, family and followers have been waiting and waiting to see the finished product, and have been my biggest cheerleaders along the way. It has been years of work already to get to this point. The original watercolor paintings were created between 2011 and 2013. Then the idea for a deck began to percolate, and in April of 2014 I put my first ideas on paper. Since then I have written the oracle text for each card, designed the product packaging and guidebook, created the Photoshop print files, worked with my vendors to produce samples.

The Akashic Oracle is an inexpensive tool that people can use everyday to promote their own well-being.

I’ve been very proud of my identity as a web developer. It’s not something that came easy to me. Creating art comes with ease, but doing the technical side of building a website is something that I had to work for. <b>The upside:</b> I have come to realize, all of the online tools that I have become skilled with, are a huge asset as I launch The Akashic Oracle.</p><p>In fifteen years, I see myself in balance and at ease. Right now, things are a little hectic. There’s a lot of work and time behind the computer. As I start out with The Akashic Oracle my desire is to transition into a more healthful flow with my livelihood.</p><hr style=""width: 100%;border:1px solid #eb1478;""/><p style=""font-size:18px;""><strong>My Story</strong></p><p>I can see that what I have to offer through my artistic and intuitive channels can be of great benefit to many people. Recently I have met quite a few people who have had similar struggles to my own. On a call the other day I spoke with someone who is struggling like I was 6 years ago, having reached the bottom and trying to get out from under the grasp of depression. It made me realize how far I have come already, and that I do have quite a few tools for surviving and thriving, and moving through the depression and anxiety. Depression can be so dark and so incredibly lonely. I shine a light for someone and let them know that they are not alone, that I’ve been through this and still go through it. There are bright spots, and there are ways to move towards those bright spots. If I can help others discover how to do that in their own lives, so that they can be more healthful and easeful and at peace, I feel like the circle is complete.</p><p><strong><i>""When I was ten I became depressed. As awful as that is, it started me on a path of self-awareness, personal development, spiritual exploration and healing. Over time I began using affirmations to support my healing. The affirmations turned into artwork as I repeated the words over and over to myself while painting.""</i></strong></p><p>In my early twenties I began participating in all night fire ceremonies. It was during these fire events that I learned that healing and transformation could happen rapidly, much more rapidly than through the mainstream channels I had been used to. I saw that working with unseen elemental energies and guides or spirits from the invisible realms could produce profound healing and shift in the physical world. As part of my personal quest for healing I began to explore this phenomenon. It led me to work with a number of different teachers and study a number of different healing modalities. I have incorporated these experiences into my own healing practices and they have certainly influenced my oracle deck.</p><hr style=""width: 100%;border:1px solid #eb1478;""/><p style=""font-size:18px;""><strong>About the Artist</strong></p><p><img alt=""Mel Shapcott Visionary Artist"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500948119/gahkbnabo0wjii0csoum.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 50%;float: left;margin:0 20px 15px 0;""/></p><p><strong>Mel Shapcott,</strong> creator of The Akashic Oracle, draws on ancient wisdom sourced from deep within. At an early age she began using her sixth sense to comprehend and navigate the world around her, and over time has cultivated this gift as a tool for healing. Through her lifelong battle with depression she gained a first-hand understanding of how to thrive despite the most difficult circumstances. As an artist, her visionary work provides an outlet for powerful knowledge embedded in genetic and cellular memory. Each image is captured without thought or analysis in a pure stream from the invisible realm.</p><p>Her journey towards well-being has compelled her to explore the world around her, as well as the world within. In 2004 she received a Bachelor’s of Fine Art from Temple University in Philadelphia, and since then has received training in many different areas. She recently achieved the honor of being a Priestess Path graduate, having completed ALisa Starkweather’s intensive apprenticeship in women’s leadership, empowerment and spirituality. Her formal Akashic Records training with urban priestess Vanessa Codorniu honed her skills as an intuitive, allowing her to easily access the invisible in order to facilitate healing and promote wellness in herself and her clients.

In order to successfully self-publish I need to order in large quantities and this campaign will raise the funds needed for me to pay for the first order! I have selected two vendors to manufacture the product, they are both located in the United States, and I feel good about working with them.My friends, family and followers have been waiting and waiting to see the finished product, and have been my biggest cheerleaders along the way. It has been years of work already to get to this point. The original watercolor paintings were created between 2011 and 2013. Then the idea for a deck began to percolate, and in April of 2014 I put my first ideas on paper. Since then I have written the oracle text for each card, designed the product packaging and guidebook, created the Photoshop print files, worked with my vendors to produce samples. The process has been monumental...and it is finally TIME! Let’s get this baby printed!The ImpactThe vibrant, visionary images of The Akashic Oracle are paired with affirmations to create a tool that anyone can use to seek inner guidance and get in touch with their own internal knowing. The cards are designed to help you reflect on situations and take appropriate action to move forward in a positive way.Contributors not only get an amazing tool for themselves, but their generosity will enable me to continue sharing The Akashic Oracle with more people. I have more artwork and additional tools to share, and a successful launch of The Akashic Oracle will make it possible for me to begin the process of bringing these to life too.I have spoken with a lot of people who are suffering inside and don’t feel like they can afford to work with a one-on-one practitioner. The Akashic Oracle is an inexpensive tool that people can use everyday to promote their own well-being. Having a dialogue with my internal self has been essential to my experience of living and surviving with depression. This deck can help you to get the dialogue started!Manifesting a VisionIn my day to day, I help my clients bring their visions into reality. A client will have an idea and they’ll need to take registrations, or send out an automated marketing campaign. Or they will need a website to promote their services or new product, and sometimes they need all of it. I take all the parts and pieces, the needs and desires, the budget, timeline, unknown elements, all of it, and develop and execute a strategy to meet the goals. As I begin this new venture of creating The Akashic Oracle deck, I’m really bringing MY OWN vision to reality...and that feels really awesome.About the Perks!The Akashic Oracle Deck — Use this deck of 48 cards to gain insights and overcome obstacles. Each card offers guidance for accessing the wisdom of the soul and calls on universal elements to support our personal and collective journeys. I am offering the first 300 decks for only $30. This is a special launch price only for the first 300 decks! Let your friends know!Akashic Oracle Shining Light — With this perk you get 2 decks at the special launch price, plus FREE shipping to one address in the US! The Shining Light perk is about sharing this healing tool with a friend that needs it. One for you... one for your friend <3Akashic Oracle Artist Print — The visionary art of the Akashic Oracle deck is available in print format. Prints arrive framed and ready to hang. Metal frame measures just over 11 inches. Once we have shipped your oracle deck, we will contact you by email and you will be able to choose the print that you will receive with this perk.Akashic Record Reading — You will receive a forty minute Akashic record reading with Mel. During your session Mel will access the Akashic records to obtain the guidance that will most benefit you at this time. You will be able ask questions and seek counsel. Once you select this perk you will be emailed a link where you can book a session. Readings are conducted by phone.Original Artwork — Receive one of Mel's original mixed media paintings. This is her newest work and it won't be available for long. These pieces are being offered as campaign perks and are a special treat for her friends, family and supporters. Look for new postings throughout the campaign.The Challenge and the UpsideThe most challenging part of this experience has been to step out of the shadows where I have purposely been hiding and present myself as the natural artist and intuitive that I have always been. I’ve been very proud of my identity as a web developer. It’s not something that came easy to me. Creating art comes with ease, but doing the technical side of building a website is something that I had to work for. The upside: I have come to realize, all of the online tools that I have become skilled with, are a huge asset as I launch The Akashic Oracle.In fifteen years, I see myself in balance and at ease. Right now, things are a little hectic. There’s a lot of work and time behind the computer. As I start out with The Akashic Oracle my desire is to transition into a more healthful flow with my livelihood.My StoryI can see that what I have to offer through my artistic and intuitive channels can be of great benefit to many people. Recently I have met quite a few people who have had similar struggles to my own. On a call the other day I spoke with someone who is struggling like I was 6 years ago, having reached the bottom and trying to get out from under the grasp of depression. It made me realize how far I have come already, and that I do have quite a few tools for surviving and thriving, and moving through the depression and anxiety. Depression can be so dark and so incredibly lonely. I shine a light for someone and let them know that they are not alone, that I’ve been through this and still go through it. There are bright spots, and there are ways to move towards those bright spots. If I can help others discover how to do that in their own lives, so that they can be more healthful and easeful and at peace, I feel like the circle is complete.""When I was ten I became depressed. As awful as that is, it started me on a path of self-awareness, personal development, spiritual exploration and healing. Over time I began using affirmations to support my healing. The affirmations turned into artwork as I repeated the words over and over to myself while painting.""In my early twenties I began participating in all night fire ceremonies. It was during these fire events that I learned that healing and transformation could happen rapidly, much more rapidly than through the mainstream channels I had been used to. I saw that working with unseen elemental energies and guides or spirits from the invisible realms could produce profound healing and shift in the physical world. As part of my personal quest for healing I began to explore this phenomenon. It led me to work with a number of different teachers and study a number of different healing modalities. I have incorporated these experiences into my own healing practices and they have certainly influenced my oracle deck.About the ArtistMel Shapcott, creator of The Akashic Oracle, draws on ancient wisdom sourced from deep within. At an early age she began using her sixth sense to comprehend and navigate the world around her, and over time has cultivated this gift as a tool for healing. Through her lifelong battle with depression she gained a first-hand understanding of how to thrive despite the most difficult circumstances. As an artist, her visionary work provides an outlet for powerful knowledge embedded in genetic and cellular memory. Each image is captured without thought or analysis in a pure stream from the invisible realm.Her journey towards well-being has compelled her to explore the world around her, as well as the world within. In 2004 she received a Bachelor’s of Fine Art from Temple University in Philadelphia, and since then has received training in many different areas. She recently achieved the honor of being a Priestess Path graduate, having completed ALisa Starkweather’s intensive apprenticeship in women’s leadership, empowerment and spirituality. Her formal Akashic Records training with urban priestess Vanessa Codorniu honed her skills as an intuitive, allowing her to easily access the invisible in order to facilitate healing and promote wellness in herself and her clients. Mel is a long-time student of ceremonial artist Mz. imani, who initiated her into the lineage of Alchemical Healers.Photo-credit: © Marsia Shuron HarrisWays You Can HelpEven if you can't fund the campaign, please help get the word out! I will be promoting in various ways, and it would mean a lot if you shared my promotional posts on Facebook or any other platform you use. Equally as important is to tell those who you think would benefit from this to visit my website: http://akashicoracle.com ""The Akashic Oracle Deck is a wonderfully illustrated wealth of knowledge that will inspire you to live life as rich as the kaleidoscope of color found in each painting. It feels like you could be looking under the microscope or into the galaxies beyond when exploring this deck. So if you are ready for the journey of self-exploration this deck will be both a guide and treasure map...explore more — dive in.""Layla Love""Each and every card is as stunningly beautiful as it is inspirational.

Così per offrire una visione dell'arte contemporanea migliore in Puglia e dare la possibilità ai giovani artisti di fare esperienza con l'opportunità di esporre ad artisti professionisti. Ciò ci sembra una prima occasione per avvicinare i mondi delle arti più giovani in una prospettiva, amministrazioni permettendo, di residenze e stage tutto l’anno così da animare il paese e innescare quel passaparola turistico virtuoso ed efficace anche fuori stagione.</p><p><strong>25 GIUGNO</strong></p><p><strong>La seconda mostra centrale della stagione sarà FORMA MENTIS.</strong></p><p>FORMA MENTIS vuole raccogliere opere site specific, di almeno 8 artisti di fama nazionale e internazionale ai quali è stato chiesto di realizzare un opera specificatamente per gli spazi museali del MAAAC o rielaborare un lavoro in dialogo con l’idea di mostra proposta.</p><p>Abbiamo diviso il museo cistranese in 8 aree di intervento.</p><p>La scelta degli artisti è naturalmente eterogenea perché vogliamo offrire una visione ampia e continuativa di ciò che succede nel mondo del contemporaneo anche in una provincia del sud, poco sollecitata da questo punto di vista  anche se molto di moda adesso e desiderosa, credo, di attrarre altre dimensioni turistiche.</p><p>Il tema FORMA MENTIS vuole richiamare l’attenzione sulle singolarità dell’approccio personale di ogni artista sia con un luogo cosi denso di storia come il sito medioevale del MAAAC cistranese sia con i reperti archeologici del museo cegliese con i suoi rinnovati spazi. Ma soprattutto tentare di comunicare il processo creativo eterogeneo sia razionale che istintivo e tecnico di chi opera nell’arte contemporanea, oggi nel mondo ipermediatico e impaziente, con il proprio lavoro frutto di accurate ricerche in tutta la gamma dell’espressione tecnica, manualità, distanze dalla quotidianità visiva e tempi. Proporre, anche nei piccoli centri, in modo più divulgativo e in rapporto con la storia dell’arte lo spazio visivo e mentale che misteriosamente porta poche migliaia di persone a creare e vivere di questo con l’ambizione di spostare di quel centimetro il senso dell’estetica e del “bello”, spesso in sordina anticipando fenomeni culturali globali,  e contribuire anche incosapevolmente alla difesa e crescita del nostro patrimonio culturale, sociale ed economico.</p><p>La FORMA MENTIS di ogni artista è unica? E’ culturale o innata? Chi inserisce una opera contemporanea nella sua abitazione entra in questa dimensione personale? O è solo emozionale? O solo economica?</p><p>La tecnologia ha infine modificato il rapporto psicologico tra arte e pubblico o è solo un nuovo strumento di lavoro?</p><p>Tutte domande a cui è difficile rispondere con certezza forse non riusciremo adesso ma è la funzione dell’arte porre dubbi e proporre visioni.</p><p>Artisti. Massimo Ruiu (docente, vive e lavora tra Roma e Monopoli), Omar Galliani (docente di Brera a Milano, vive e lavora a Reggio Emilia), Elisa Gallenca (vive e lavora tra Ceglie Messapica e Torino), Maura Banfo (vive e lavora a Torino), Benedetto Marcucci (artista e giornalista, vive e lavora a Roma), Fabrizio Fontana, artista e designer vive a S.

Così per offrire una visione dell'arte contemporanea migliore in Puglia e dare la possibilità ai giovani artisti di fare esperienza con l'opportunità di esporre ad artisti professionisti. Ciò ci sembra una prima occasione per avvicinare i mondi delle arti più giovani in una prospettiva, amministrazioni permettendo, di residenze e stage tutto l’anno così da animare il paese e innescare quel passaparola turistico virtuoso ed efficace anche fuori stagione.25 GIUGNOLa seconda mostra centrale della stagione sarà FORMA MENTIS.FORMA MENTIS vuole raccogliere opere site specific, di almeno 8 artisti di fama nazionale e internazionale ai quali è stato chiesto di realizzare un opera specificatamente per gli spazi museali del MAAAC o rielaborare un lavoro in dialogo con l’idea di mostra proposta.Abbiamo diviso il museo cistranese in 8 aree di intervento.La scelta degli artisti è naturalmente eterogenea perché vogliamo offrire una visione ampia e continuativa di ciò che succede nel mondo del contemporaneo anche in una provincia del sud, poco sollecitata da questo punto di vista  anche se molto di moda adesso e desiderosa, credo, di attrarre altre dimensioni turistiche.Il tema FORMA MENTIS vuole richiamare l’attenzione sulle singolarità dell’approccio personale di ogni artista sia con un luogo cosi denso di storia come il sito medioevale del MAAAC cistranese sia con i reperti archeologici del museo cegliese con i suoi rinnovati spazi. Ma soprattutto tentare di comunicare il processo creativo eterogeneo sia razionale che istintivo e tecnico di chi opera nell’arte contemporanea, oggi nel mondo ipermediatico e impaziente, con il proprio lavoro frutto di accurate ricerche in tutta la gamma dell’espressione tecnica, manualità, distanze dalla quotidianità visiva e tempi. Proporre, anche nei piccoli centri, in modo più divulgativo e in rapporto con la storia dell’arte lo spazio visivo e mentale che misteriosamente porta poche migliaia di persone a creare e vivere di questo con l’ambizione di spostare di quel centimetro il senso dell’estetica e del “bello”, spesso in sordina anticipando fenomeni culturali globali,  e contribuire anche incosapevolmente alla difesa e crescita del nostro patrimonio culturale, sociale ed economico.La FORMA MENTIS di ogni artista è unica? E’ culturale o innata? Chi inserisce una opera contemporanea nella sua abitazione entra in questa dimensione personale? O è solo emozionale? O solo economica?La tecnologia ha infine modificato il rapporto psicologico tra arte e pubblico o è solo un nuovo strumento di lavoro?Tutte domande a cui è difficile rispondere con certezza forse non riusciremo adesso ma è la funzione dell’arte porre dubbi e proporre visioni.Artisti.

<h3><u>Space Taxi History</u></h3>
<p>The Space Taxi is a community art car that began during the summer of 2009 by Portland, Oregon adventure artists Chris Landon (Doktor Creature), Myriah Day (Norma L.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>WE are making a show that looks at the future of art and visual engagement. The way people see is changing. The biology, the psychology, these are changing. But there is also this primitive reptilian part of our brain that does not change. The rest of us is just further removed from it, the futuristic always progressing outward from the prehistoric centre.</p>
<p>There will always be people who will say “we’ve gone too far! The centre cannot hold”</p>
<p>The centre has held us forever, the reptile part of us doesn’t know much, but it knows how to HOLD. It knows how to attach to what will keep it alive. As our conscious minds progress further, we cross thresholds and continue forward until where we came from is out of sight. No turning back now. These are days of wonder and reckoning. And the stimulated mystified mind, just freshly landed from a GIANT LEAP is looking to establish contact, to re-establish contact to the primal collective heartbeat, to that bass vibration.</p>
<p>As artists we must translate this. The media is new because they are tools not used before or finished works resolved like none before.  A video becomes a photograph, a photograph becomes a painting, and a painting becomes a hand on a heart, feeling that bass vibration. New media is new in form, new in content, new in the way we see it.</p>
<p>Sometimes, we do not see it. It is in our hands and we are squeezing it so tightly, and still we do not see it. Maybe this happens many times, how can we know for sure? Only looking back will give us that kind of wisdom. And now is not the time for looking back. The place we came from is out of sight for some time now. Now is new. Time is new. Everything we do is new: thrilling, confounding, frustrating, liberating, new!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>If our Heart is a treasure chest of wisdom, solutions, and ideas (and it is), how do we mine the treasure? Especially if our small (and usually scared) human mind holds the key! </p>
<p>I'm Laurie Morse and I've had a book inside me about this wisdom mining thing for 8yrs. now. Yet, I know in every cell of my being that creativity is healing.</p>
<p>Did you know that 'Creativity' is the #1 thing companies look for now in potential job candidates, it moved into that spot from lower on the list this year. </p>
<p>It's starting to get a little 'buzzy' this creativity thing. I want to make something really clear and that is: creativity and talent are two different things. Some people cultivate their artistic talent, but creativity is in everyone. And when we tap into that intelligence (which happens to be in all 37.4 trillion cells of every human being), it holds solutions, answers to problems, our personal medicine. </p>
<p>That's how important it is. Insights might arrive as a creative solution to a family issue, or an excellent business idea that changes the course of your success, or maybe you want to make a change in the world and your creative process lands you smack dab on a brilliant new way of doing something.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I've been invited to an author experience that I've had my eye on for a while. It's a soup to nuts program. Meaning there is a book coach, editors, a timeline for getting the book written (who among us doesn't need an accountability nudge, especially for birthing something like a book).  Once the book is written there is an entire design for getting the book into readers hands in order to make an impact with the message. The entire program is $15,000 which is what my campaign goal is. </p>
<p>A little more about the program itself...</p>
<p>This team has helped to publish almost 1000 books (including a book written by Arianna Huffington). They know what they're doing, they work for the right reasons...to spread messages of hope and healing, messages that make a difference in lives.</p>
<p>Here's what they say about the authors they work with...""We create an environment that permits and nurtures the formation and development of author's, who in turn write important books."" And by the way, they don't work with everyone, their stats are that they get 1000 applications a month for 25 spots. They say, ""No other book program has a completion rate of more than 95% (most book programs have a completion rate of less than 10%) and the process I've built to vet and interview applicants is one of the biggest reasons why we only allow people who truly have what it takes into my program.""</p>
<p>I feel honored to be invited in. I really want to do this and I need your help. The timeline for getting the book written is 9 weeks, which is approximately the end of September. How amazing is that! </p>
<p><strong><u>Your $20 or more donation</u></strong></p>
<ul><li>A Hot off the Press copy of the e-Book</li></ul>
<p><u><strong>Your $100 or more donation</strong></u></p>
<ul>
<li>A Hot off the Press copy of the e-Book</li>
<li>3 updates on the whole creative book writing process between now and October. The updates will include either a blog post, a video, or an audio (or all 3). These will include stories from the book on how incredible it is to activate our creative cellular intelligence.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Your $500 or more donation</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All of the above PLUS...</li>
<li>Live virtual experience of taking something that isn't working in your life, or something that needs healing, and creating a powerful transformation. You'll identify and claim what is more serving (i.e. what your heart desires), and together we'll intentionally cause that to come forth into your life via the alchemy of a creative healing process.  </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If you feel moved and inspired by this project and my burning desire to make this happen now, if you have a secret (or maybe not so secret) desire to tap more of your own Creative Life Force, remember that doesn't mean talent, it means the Creative Life Force that's beating your heart, pumping your blood, and digesting your last meal right now as you read this, then I whole-heartedly invite you to be one who supports me and this project. Be one who is part of the solutions so needed in the world now (awakening creativity in a person means they contribute to Life rather than leaving their treasure buried).</p>
<p>Even if you don't want to explore creativity for yourself, if you know that tapping creativity is vital for humanity's future, then I invite you to support this project!</p>
<p>When we connect with the Creative Life Force, there is access to new and different ways of doing things. Ways that work better. It seems like at this point in humanity, we could sure use some creative outpouring! By the way, the Creative Life Force is Love.</p>
<p>I'm devoted to unearthing that for us all, how about you?</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>What I love is that the success rate for this program is 95%, of course that's if the participant does the work. I'm one who will hit the ground running and do my part no question. My biggest 'challenge' is time to write, and the program even teaches that part, how to weave writing into a busy life. The way I'm looking at that is I can carve out whatever time needed for 2 months, especially since it's been 10yrs now!</p>
<p>Whether I make the total goal or not, this book is getting written.  Thank you for being a part of the process!</p>

This team has helped to publish almost 1000 books (including a book written by Arianna Huffington). They know what they're doing, they work for the right reasons...to spread messages of hope and healing, messages that make a difference in lives.
Here's what they say about the authors they work with...""We create an environment that permits and nurtures the formation and development of author's, who in turn write important books."" And by the way, they don't work with everyone, their stats are that they get 1000 applications a month for 25 spots. They say, ""No other book program has a completion rate of more than 95% (most book programs have a completion rate of less than 10%) and the process I've built to vet and interview applicants is one of the biggest reasons why we only allow people who truly have what it takes into my program.""
I feel honored to be invited in. I really want to do this and I need your help. The timeline for getting the book written is 9 weeks, which is approximately the end of September. How amazing is that! 
Your $20 or more donation
A Hot off the Press copy of the e-Book
Your $100 or more donation

A Hot off the Press copy of the e-Book
3 updates on the whole creative book writing process between now and October. The updates will include either a blog post, a video, or an audio (or all 3). These will include stories from the book on how incredible it is to activate our creative cellular intelligence.

Your $500 or more donation

All of the above PLUS...
Live virtual experience of taking something that isn't working in your life, or something that needs healing, and creating a powerful transformation. You'll identify and claim what is more serving (i.e. what your heart desires), and together we'll intentionally cause that to come forth into your life via the alchemy of a creative healing process.  

 

The Impact
If you feel moved and inspired by this project and my burning desire to make this happen now, if you have a secret (or maybe not so secret) desire to tap more of your own Creative Life Force, remember that doesn't mean talent, it means the Creative Life Force that's beating your heart, pumping your blood, and digesting your last meal right now as you read this, then I whole-heartedly invite you to be one who supports me and this project. Be one who is part of the solutions so needed in the world now (awakening creativity in a person means they contribute to Life rather than leaving their treasure buried).
Even if you don't want to explore creativity for yourself, if you know that tapping creativity is vital for humanity's future, then I invite you to support this project!
When we connect with the Creative Life Force, there is access to new and different ways of doing things. Ways that work better. It seems like at this point in humanity, we could sure use some creative outpouring! By the way, the Creative Life Force is Love.
I'm devoted to unearthing that for us all, how about you?


Risks & Challenges
What I love is that the success rate for this program is 95%, of course that's if the participant does the work. I'm one who will hit the ground running and do my part no question. My biggest 'challenge' is time to write, and the program even teaches that part, how to weave writing into a busy life. The way I'm looking at that is I can carve out whatever time needed for 2 months, especially since it's been 10yrs now!
Whether I make the total goal or not, this book is getting written.  Thank you for being a part of the process!",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>The Idea for Camp Church of The Ceiling Cat started 10 years ago</strong> when The Ceiling Cat Prophet began proselytizing on the playa the gospel of the Ceiling Cat: a mythical deity that lives in your ceiling and always watches you, so you know you are never alone. She met thousands of people who wanted to share stories about their cats. Some stories were funny, and some were sad, but The Ceiling Cat Prophet was always there to hear them.</p>
<p><strong>The Prophet is easy to spot with her flowing dresses, cat ears, and dozens of stuffed cats pinned to her dresses. She spreads words of love,</strong> <i>“Your cat is the best cat, my cat is the best cat, and every cat is the best cat,” </i>and she gives away “Ceiling Cat Loves You!” pins so her followers can recognize each other. </p>
<p><strong>For a decade now The Prophet has been supporting Burning Man’s 10 Principles.</strong> Today she is one of the longest-running performing arts projects on the playa, according to the podcast <a href=""https://journal.burningman.org/2018/03/black-rock-city/tales-from-the-playa/accuracy-third-podcast-season-3-episodes-3-and-4/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Accuracy Third</a>.</p>
<p>Off the playa, The Prophet keeps connected with over 1,400 Burners and other followers throughout the year via a lively <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/1544059379156675/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook group</a> of fellow cat lovers.

<h3>Why a Beehive?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>A beehive is a natural collective, formed by a series of individuals who contribute unique skills and processes to enrich their community as a whole. 'The Beehive', therefore, felt like the perfect metaphor for the project: a public art installation that champions community cohesion and celebrates individuals, offering them a supportive space to exhibit their skill sets and methods of self-expression. The project supports the environment through collaborating with local hives, the rewards of wildflower seeds and the recycling of donated clothing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Beehive project can be split into two main chunks: <strong>The Build</strong> and <strong>The Tour</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559587932/qlpwmtcjpscgovgybtke.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Build:</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The build of The Beehive aims to involve local communities around Tolworth, Kingston, Surbiton, Long Ditton, and surrounding areas in various ways. To make the internal lining of The Beehive, I am running free inclusive creative workshops with schools, hospitals, care homes and an array of social groups. I will be teaching individuals new skills and encouraging people to work together. An international open call for handmade bees is running until July 10th, inviting creatives to submit their work to be exhibited in the Beehive as it tours. Recycled textiles will be used to make the lining - those donated with a personal memory will feature in the project's book (published by Sampson Low Ltd).  The geodesic structure will be built using local materials in collaboration with SHEDx and the design and architecture firm the 121 Collective. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559587971/iulg1wv8cophtyjy68oq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Tour:</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The Beehive installation will tour the local area visiting a variety of public spaces for a minimum of 3 months. The Beehive will be a constantly evolving space full of workshops, performances, film screenings, talks, events and more, highlighting all the creative talent existing in the local area and giving people an accessible platform to playfully experiment with their ideas. </p>

<h3>The Big Picture</h3>
<p>We are in a moment of historic change:  A crescendo of calls for racial justice, and a new openness to hearing them. Economic life, especially for those who already had less, near a breaking point. High-stakes decisions about immigration. Systemic poverty. Environmental justice. Mass incarceration. <strong>All around us, bold voices are crying out for radical love and justice in a broken world. </strong></p>
<p>For 11 years, A Peace of My Mind has been growing toward this very moment. It’s time for us to seek out leaders on the front edge of change—to amplify them—and to join them in imagining new possibilities. <strong>It’s time to create a new body of work that speaks to the challenges of today and celebrates the people who are working to solve them. </strong></p>
<p>In the next year, I’ll seek out people on the leading edge of these movements, as well as those directly impacted by the issues. We’ll photograph them, interview them, record the conversations, and share the results as podcasts and online stories. We’ll be looking for hope, transformation, courage, and inspiration as we develop a new series of stories called <strong>Cry Out: Voices calling for radical love and justice in a broken world.</strong></p>
<p>We know you care passionately about this work and we invite you to help us expand and amplify it. This funding campaign is the first phase of a three-part process. This campaign will support travel costs to gather and edit the stories, then share them through our <a href=""http://apeaceofmymind.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">online platform</a> and <a href=""https://www.buzzsprout.com/959767"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">our podcast.</a></p>
<h3>The Goal We Share</h3>
<p>The world is filled with challenges, and it's time that we face them honestly and directly. For too long, voices that have cried out for change have gone unheard. It's time to move outside of our comfort zones. It's time to listen to new voices. It's time to challenge ourselves and the way we see the world. In the face of overwhelming odds, creative people are finding  ways to build community, correct injustice, and promote healing.</p>
<p>A Peace of My Mind finds those stories and amplifies them. We record those stories and hold them up as a model for how we can move forward into a more just and equitable future. We find ourselves at a unique moment in history, and through listening, we have the chance to learn how we can live better together. I'm asking you to help A Peace of My Mind document the ways the world is crying out for change and doing the hard work to make it happen.​</p>
<h3>Why Now?</h3>
<p>There is an urgency to this moment. These past few months have offered us a pause from what had become normal and presented an opportunity for reflection. Issues that seemed at the periphery of our awareness are now at the center, in critical focus, and we have the opportunity to reinvent the way we live our lives and the way we relate to those around us.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, A Peace of My Mind has developed a deep collection of stories that reflect our diverse American experience. In this moment, I want to seek out voices from the leading edge of change. I want to lend my voice to theirs and cry out for others to hear.</p>
<p>These years of listening have prepared me, and the pandemic has opened a space in my schedule to act boldly. This spring, unable to travel to in-person engagements but attentive to the power of personal stories, we created the podcast <a href=""https://www.buzzsprout.com/959767"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">How Life Changed</a> to explore this unprecedented time through the lens of individual stories. In a matter of weeks, we recorded 40 interviews and learned how to publish each as a podcast episode.</p>
<p>Then, with the tragic killing of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis, we brought a portable studio to the intersection of 38th and Chicago (the site where George Floyd was killed) to ask people simply, ""What do you want to say?"" It turned into a powerful body of work that <a href=""https://apomm.net/2020/06/03/maybe-this-time/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">you can see here.</a></p>
<p>Movements for racial, economic, and climate justice are more urgent by the day. We need to lift up the voices of those who are most impacted and those who are leading the way with bold vision and real solutions. A Peace of My Mind has the tools, the network, the desire, and the time to respond to this moment. With your help, I can also gather the resources to move headlong into this new series of portraits and stories.</p>
<h3>My Backstory</h3>
<p>I've spent three decades as a freelance photographer, shooting projects for national magazines and Fortune 500 companies. Eleven years ago, I founded A Peace of My Mind, a multimedia arts project that uses photography and storytelling to explore our common humanity. In an increasingly polarized world, A Peace of My Mind encourages us to rediscover what connects us.</p>
<p>Our first book and exhibits were produced in our own back yard of Minnesota. Then, a 40,000-mile road trip across the United States gathered new stories for our second book and exhibits: A Peace of My Mind: American Stories.</p>
<p>In recent years, we've brought our exhibits around the country and used the stories to talk about conflict resolution, civic responsibility, and social change. I've led programming at small public high schools, churches, and community centers, as well as the National Civil Rights Museum and Rutgers University's Honors College. This small little side hustle has turned into my life's work, and it keeps me running. I'm happy to run, because it feels like the world needs these messages of hope and healing more and more every day.</p>
<p>A Peace of My Mind has been a grass-roots passion project from the very start, and we have grown with the encouragement and support of hundreds of people who believe in the mission. Good folks have nudged us along at key times to help us grow and to keep the wheels turning.</p>
<p>This is one of those key times, again. Although I'm always reluctant to do so, it's time to cry out for help.</p>
<p>My dreams are bigger than my means at the moment. All of the relationships and connections are in place for this to happen. I have the time available to launch into this work. We just need the funding, so I'm turning to you. And it's completely up to you how big this will become.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This funding campaign is the first phase of a three-part process. This phase will fund travel costs to gather and edit the stories, then share them through our <a href=""http://apeaceofmymind.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">online platform</a> and <a href=""https://www.buzzsprout.com/959767"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">our podcast.</a></p>
<p>We will be a two-person crew (myself and an audio tech), and we will build our travel schedule according to the availability of our interview subjects. </p>
<p>The budget will cover travel, lodging, meals, etc. while we are on the road. And once we return, it will also cover transcription services, editing, and production time to share the stories online.</p>
<p>We will share the content in weekly podcast episodes, on our website and our social media platforms. We'll share the experiences and the stories step-by-step as we explore solutions to our most challenging problems and we will elevate the voices of those who are leading the way toward change.</p>
<p>We have a collection of exciting perks to thank you for your support. Explore the page and you'll see some of our existing books, branded coins and stickers, signed press sheets, and even personal Zoom appearances for your neighborhood book clubs. At the highest levels of support, you can choose from your own legacy interview, a behind-the-scenes visit, or a presentation in your own community.</p>
<p>Our budget is scalable. If we don't reach our goal, we will do what we can with the money we raise, even if it means using frequent flier miles and sleeping on friends' couches. Every dollar from this campaign will go toward pushing the project forward.</p>
<p>If we exceed our goal, we will expand the number of interviews. We'll explore new ways of sharing them. We'll build a little team to help grow the series.</p>
<p>If we blow the roof off, we'll simply roll right into phases two and three and produce a book and an exhibit from the stories we gather...but let's not get ahead of ourselves just yet. Let's see how this unfolds.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In a polarized world, we require hope. We need tools that can connect us and bridge divides, and we need examples of success in order to believe that something better is possible. A Peace of My Mind has more than ten years of experience gathering stories and using them to encourage positive conversations. We have dreamt big and asked for help and put our noses to the grindstone to get the hard work done. And we've got a track record to prove it. More than anything, we have seen the way these stories can inspire, encourage conversation, and offer hope to a world that desperately needs it. Check out a few of these testimonials from people who have engaged with our work:</p>
<p>“John Noltner takes us on a unique journey filled with revelations of courage and commitment, resilience and hope. It is a beautiful journey that speaks to our innermost being. It touches us in a way that allows us to see the world from a different perspective. Perhaps it will inspire us to become peacemakers.” ~ Ela Gandhi, South African peace activist and granddaughter of Mahatma Gandhi</p>
<p>“ A Peace of My Mind offers a much-needed salve for these painful, polarized times we live in.”        ~ Vijay Pendakur, Ed.D. Robert W. and Elizabeth C. Staley Dean of Students, Cornell University</p>
<p>“Mr. Noltner’s work will tug at your heart and your sense of humanity. It’s difficult to digest this work and remain indifferent. A Peace of My Mind is an encouraging stimulus to action!” ~ Terri Lee Freeman, President, National Civil Rights Museum</p>
<p>“I would recommend John Noltner’s work to anyone who wants to experience the diversity of human beings and the universality of the human condition.” ~ Jim Wallis, New York Times bestselling author of The UnCommon Good, president of Sojourners, and editor-in-chief of Sojourners magazine</p>
<p>“What sets John Noltner apart is his ability to capture not just the story, but the raw emotion and purpose through his lens. John has time and time again been able to listen and help us tell our story.” ~ Heather Ehle, CEO/Founder, Project Sanctuary</p>
<h3>Building a Team</h3>
<p>I say ""WE"" a lot when I talk about A Peace of My Mind, and it's because I recognize that none of this can happen without your help. We are, indeed, a million points of light. Imagine what we can do together. Come along for the journey.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Some of the people I hope to interview for this series are well-known and busy individuals. We will need to be persistent and flexible to accommodate their schedules. We will strive to create an efficient travel route, but it is likely we will have to backtrack and revisit regions in order to gather the stories we need.</p>
<p>COVID-19 is not done yet. It's unclear exactly what the fall will look like, and we may need to adjust our plans as travel restrictions shift and as our subjects experience varying levels of comfort with meeting in person.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the scope of this new series will be driven by the funding we raise. If the budget is limited, we will have to make choices about how many stories to tell and how we will share them. As the budget increases, we can offer more content and find new, innovative ways of sharing it (like the <a href=""https://apomm.net/2020/06/29/i-can-hear-the-streets-talking/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">public projections</a> we have been doing in Minneapolis).</p>
<p>More than anything, I know we will encounter unexpected challenges. This has been the story of A Peace of My Mind's journey. We are comfortable with a fluid process where we learn from each new experience, readjust the process, and embrace that new knowledge to inform our path forward. There's new learning every day, and it's part of what makes life interesting and beautiful.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some folks just won't be able to contribute financially, and that's understandable, but there are other ways you can help with the effort:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tell your friends. Spread the word. If we are going to be successful, we'll have to reach far beyond our usual circles, and we'll need your help to make some noise about this campaign.</li>
<li>Use the Indiegogo share tools to spread the message on social media.</li>
<li>Share your ideas about where we should go and who we should talk with.</li>
<li>Like, comment, share, repeat. It all helps amplify our message AND it helps keep us energized during the long campaign. We need to hear that you are with us in spirit, too.</li>
</ul>
</div></div>","The Big Picture
We are in a moment of historic change:  A crescendo of calls for racial justice, and a new openness to hearing them. Economic life, especially for those who already had less, near a breaking point. High-stakes decisions about immigration. Systemic poverty. Environmental justice. Mass incarceration. All around us, bold voices are crying out for radical love and justice in a broken world. 
For 11 years, A Peace of My Mind has been growing toward this very moment. It’s time for us to seek out leaders on the front edge of change—to amplify them—and to join them in imagining new possibilities. It’s time to create a new body of work that speaks to the challenges of today and celebrates the people who are working to solve them. 
In the next year, I’ll seek out people on the leading edge of these movements, as well as those directly impacted by the issues. We’ll photograph them, interview them, record the conversations, and share the results as podcasts and online stories. We’ll be looking for hope, transformation, courage, and inspiration as we develop a new series of stories called Cry Out: Voices calling for radical love and justice in a broken world.
We know you care passionately about this work and we invite you to help us expand and amplify it. This funding campaign is the first phase of a three-part process. This campaign will support travel costs to gather and edit the stories, then share them through our online platform and our podcast.
The Goal We Share
The world is filled with challenges, and it's time that we face them honestly and directly. For too long, voices that have cried out for change have gone unheard. It's time to move outside of our comfort zones. It's time to listen to new voices. It's time to challenge ourselves and the way we see the world. In the face of overwhelming odds, creative people are finding  ways to build community, correct injustice, and promote healing.
A Peace of My Mind finds those stories and amplifies them. We record those stories and hold them up as a model for how we can move forward into a more just and equitable future. We find ourselves at a unique moment in history, and through listening, we have the chance to learn how we can live better together. I'm asking you to help A Peace of My Mind document the ways the world is crying out for change and doing the hard work to make it happen.​

It stems from the Vedie Agnihotra Ritual and is performed by qualified priests and acharyas for the benefit of individuals, the state or all sentient beings in general. The consecrated fire is believed to have a powerful cleansing effect spiritually and psychologically. The ritual is performed for the purpose of destroying negative energies, detrimental thoughts and desires, and for the making of secular requests and blessings. In most Shingon Sect Temples, this ritual is performed daily in the morning or the afternoon, and is a requirement for all for all acharyas to learn this ritual upon entering the priesthood. Larger scale ceremonies often include the constant beating of taiko drums and mass chanting of the mantra of Acalanatha by priests and lay practitioners. Flames can sometimes reach a few meters high. The combination of the ritual's visuals and sounds can be trance-inducing and make for a profound experience.</p><p><u>Homa Stick (添護摩木）</u></p><p>Homa Stick is a wood for burning when a holy fire is lighted.

Koya, Wakayama, Japan.It is called the Ekoin (“廻向院” in Japanese character) because the Master Kukai (a.k.a. Kobo-Daishi who is a founder of Shingon Sect) erected a five-storied pagoda in this location, and his disciple Dosho, the priest, performed “Eko” (“廻向” in Japanese), the revolving of the people (the memorial service of the ancestors) in here.  During Hoei period (early 1700s), Ekoin is renamed to our current name by Yoshimune Tokugawa who is 8th shogun of Tokugawa Shogunate. (The name given at that time had same sound, but different character as “恵光院” )We have two halls. Main hall enshrines Amida Nyorai (Amitabha in Sanskrit), Kukai (Kobo-Daishi), and Fudo Myo (Acalanatha in Sanskrit). And the other hall called “Bishamon Hall” enshrines Bishamon Ten (Vaisravana in Sanskrit) as its principal images.Ekoin is also known as a Shukubo (“宿坊” in Japanese). Shukubo is a place where you can get the taste of monk’s life style with “Temple Lodging”. You can stay in our temple, enjoy our Shojin Ryori (Buddhist’s Vegetarian Cuisine) and experience acitivities.A specialty experiences at Ekoin are ""Homa Fire Ritual"" and ""Meditation"". Visitors can join the Homa Fire Ritual, performed every morning with monks. And various kinds of meditation programs are offered.   Introduction of Koya-sanKoya-san (Mt. Koya) is well known as a Headquarter of Shingon Sect Buddhism which is found by Master Kukai (Kobo-Daishi) back in 9th century. It is also known as a World Heritage certified in 2004. Therefore, Koya-san is not only a place for religious believers, but also an unique place for visitors & travelers now. Within Koya-san, there is the Master Head Temple “Kongobuji” in the middle, and many of  Head and Semi Head Temples around. Each temple has its’ own historical episodes and heritages. Every time you visit, you must find and experience something different. Current Situtaion in Koya-san Due to “COVID-19” situation, visitors to Koya-san has dramatically decreased. The number of visitors to Ekoin now is 5% of usual. If this situation continues, we will face the difficulty to preserve this historically & religiously important heritages. Your contribution will save it.  About Homa Fire RitualHoma Fire Ritual (護摩祈祷）The Homa Fire Ritual of consecrated fire in unique to Vajrayana and Esoteric Buddhism and is perhaps also the most mystical and cognitively powerful. It stems from the Vedie Agnihotra Ritual and is performed by qualified priests and acharyas for the benefit of individuals, the state or all sentient beings in general. The consecrated fire is believed to have a powerful cleansing effect spiritually and psychologically. The ritual is performed for the purpose of destroying negative energies, detrimental thoughts and desires, and for the making of secular requests and blessings. In most Shingon Sect Temples, this ritual is performed daily in the morning or the afternoon, and is a requirement for all for all acharyas to learn this ritual upon entering the priesthood. Larger scale ceremonies often include the constant beating of taiko drums and mass chanting of the mantra of Acalanatha by priests and lay practitioners. Flames can sometimes reach a few meters high. The combination of the ritual's visuals and sounds can be trance-inducing and make for a profound experience.Homa Stick (添護摩木）Homa Stick is a wood for burning when a holy fire is lighted. Wishes and Names of prayers will be written on it, and a priest burns it in the Homa Fire Ritual. Picture of Homa Fire Ritual at EkoinPicture of Homa Stick (Left)  Ekoin x CMK CollaborationEkoin is collaborating with world's famous Tattoo/Graffiti artist, TAKIZO MORO who belongs to CMK.

 Why we started this project & What we want to doUnder the COVID-19 situation, people all over the world are asked self-restraint (or maybe stricter in some places) to go out. Of course, “going abroad” is out of question now. People cannot come and pray in  Koya-san even if they wanted to. We understand this is a necessary sacrifice.Under such a situation, we monks at Ekoin discussed, What can we do for the world? What can we do for Koya-san? How can we help the world?How can we preserve the history, culture, heritage, and people in here? And we reached an answer, What we monks can do is “pray for the world from here”. This is our motivation to start this campaign.   What you'll get from contribution-We will pray ""World Peace"" and ""World Health"" instead of backers. -Backers will receive unique return items depend on the amount of contribution. All items will be prayed by monks in Ekoin with certain traditional praying ceremony. Please check out the all perks we offer.-Through your contribution, you can save not only temple itself, but people's life working for Koya-san temples such as craftsman in here, cooks in here etc. FinallyThank you for reading to the end.Ekoin sincerely pray that the coronavirus pandemic will end as soon as possible and everyone will be able to visit Koya-san.Until people come to a peaceful world without any conflicts, we monks offer prayers. So that you can relieve the suffering of living things.  Gassho (合掌) This project will be implemented in the flexible funding.

<h2>MUSEUM OF MOBILE ART</h2>
<p>The Museum of Mobile Art is  Melissa E. Logan (musician and artist), Jakob S. Boeskov (filmmaker and artist) and K.O. Nnamdie (executive curator). We believe in the power of art to transform, to uplift - especially in time of crisis. Museums are closed, therefore we will practice a method of cultural appreciation in the open air, an interactive museum without walls. <strong>We want you to join us!</strong></p>
<p>It's our pleasure to offer you a chance to take part in our joyous journey from New York to Tennessee. The late, great Andy Warhol famously called the American zones between Los Angeles and New York ""Fly-Over Country"" and <i>that's exactly where we're going! </i></p>
<h2> </h2>
<p> </p>
<h2>A SIMPLE SOLUTION</h2>
<p>The mission is delightfully simple: To bring sculptures, banners and prints from world-renowned artists and newbies to areas beyond the main cultural capitals. We are escaping the mega city of New York, to come face to face - at a safe distance - in parks and public spaces, with art lovers and coincidental bystanders, in open air happenings. We aim for collaborations with local artists, building a dialogue with the artworks we bring from New York. Museum of Mobile Art  celebrates big ideas in small formats, easy storage, mobility, instantaneous happenings, at breakneck speed. We print it, we post it, and we perform it. The world is moving at internet speed, and so are we. Every day is marked by a sunrise, and by sunset the performance is happening. Everything will be documented in 4K footage, to be posted on our YouTube channel. We will drive our art-van full speed into the present moment: It's 2020, an election year in a hurting and divided world, and we are here to help. Today aspects of the art world that used to make sense suddenly seem absurd, but that's no excuse to stop making art. We believe it's time to embrace this new absurdity, to journey into a wonderful and frightening world, head first, in a van filled with art, costumes and a portable sound system.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2>HOW CAN YOU SUPPORT?</h2>
<p>We are cheap, we are fast, we are ecstatic. But yes, we do in fact need funds for vehicle rental, for gas, water and art printing materials. In order to do so, we are humbly asking for your support. The minimum donation is $25. Should you have the ability to donate more, we are offering you special art prizes.</p>
</div><div>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT?</h2>
<p>In the spirit of total democracy we want to foster and help seed new art communities, to meet individuals, to expand minds, especially our own. We offer possibilities for others to join us for the ride. As artists coming from cultural deserts/rural areas, we acknowledge how important it is to have strangers come and deliver divergent ways of art and life.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2>RISK AND CHALLENGES</h2>
<p>We are  artist/producers with years of experience working with various institutions like Tate Britain, MoMA, National Museum of Modern Art, Kyoto and The Centre Pompidou, just to name a few. On the ground projects include out-reach brunch programs to the homeless in our neighborhoods, building musical instruments for refugee kids in Munich, Germany. Our challenge now is urgency and speed. We are simply looking to rent a vehicle and purchase art materials /prints that will allow us to put on art shows in Tennessee. Should we raise too little funding our car will be of bad quality, and we will sleep on sofas with friends. Should we raise more, we will have funding for higher quality/larger prints, and also motels which will allow us to focus better on the art happenings.</p>

<p>Microscope <strong>must unexpectedly move</strong> from its long-time space in Bushwick Brooklyn by the end of April. We are seeking your help to create <strong>a new home</strong> that will allow us to <strong>continue and expand our programming</strong>, especially our weekly <strong>Event Series</strong> of time-based arts, which we have been preparing to resume in-person — after more than a year online — as soon as it is safely possible.</p>

<p>Although it has been a difficult decision to leave our current space and neighborhood, we are excited about <strong>this new chapter for Microscope</strong> and hope that you will contribute to make this transition possible!</p>
<p>For those who would like tax-deductible options please visit our companion campaign on Fractured Atlas <a href=""https://fundraising.fracturedatlas.org/microscope-gallery/campaigns/4121"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>HERE</strong></a>.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Microscope Gallery was <strong>founded in September of 2010</strong> by artists and curators Andrea Monti and Elle Burchill  in the Bushwick area of Brooklyn, NY <strong>as an inclusive space dedicated to the time-based arts</strong>, presenting regular <strong>exhibitions</strong> as well as a weekly <strong>series of events</strong> featuring emerging to often overlooked, groundbreaking artists.</p>
<p>The main motivations for starting Microscope were to address a <strong>general lack of time-based works in art galleries</strong> as well as what we considered — and still do — as an <strong>unnecessary divide</strong> in the conversations and appreciation of works exhibited in the daylight setting of the gallery as opposed to those typically presented in the darkness of the screening/sound/performance venue. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1617148397/mzx4ftid4ojereatw9p8.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Through <strong>both exhibitions and events</strong>, Microscope offers new and <strong>emerging artists</strong> the opportunity for larger bodies of their works to be seen, and for <strong>rediscoveries of overlooked works</strong> by more established artists.  Additionally, Microscope is <strong>committed to increasing the inclusivity and diversity of its Series</strong> through, among others, a <strong>new group of core curators</strong> programming events on a regular basis, as well as collaborations with other organizations.</p>
<p>To date, we have presented <strong>more than 85 art exhibitions</strong> and nearly <strong>600 events</strong> featuring works in moving image, digital, sound, performance, and more. Mediums include celluloid film, analog and digital video, stereoscopic 3D, 3D animation; live multi-screen and mixed media performances such as expanded cinema, A/V, 8-bit and VHS mixing; acoustic, noise, spoken word, experimental, and electronic sound; durational and other performance art, among many others.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>We are <strong>excited to resume events onsite in our new space as soon as it is safe</strong>, and to continue to offer the chance to virtually attend the events online for anyone who is unable to be physically present.</p>
<p>Microscope always <strong>welcomes unsolicited submissions</strong> of works for consideration in future event and exhibition programming, and reviews them periodically. “Open Call” opportunities each year are also offered.</p>

<h3>Why We Need Your Support Now</h3>
<p>We have <strong>suddenly found ourselves in urgent need of a new home</strong>. In the last few weeks, circumstances in our building have made it <strong>impossible for us to continue our operations in our current space</strong>. As the oldest gallery currently operating in Bushwick for eleven years, we are finding the decision to leave our beloved neighborhood to be an extremely difficult one.</p>
<p>To our surprise, <strong>we have quickly managed to find a new space</strong> near the High Line in Manhattan that with your help, will allow us to continue and expand our programming. A new location and <strong>new home for time-based artists</strong> that we hope we will be able to build with your support.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1617148912/tq6t0idl0evh4cowxv1t.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This includes <strong>our Event Series</strong>, which requires very specific conditions relating to ceiling height, wall surface space, projection distances, acoustics, equipment storage, and so forth.</p>
<p>Although it may seem optimistic to embark in a move to a new space and to think of the possibility of in-person events during a still ongoing pandemic, it is clear that Microscope cannot exist without a physical place. <strong>In the not-too-distant future we will finally be able to reunite again IRL!</strong> Also, as we wait for that day, our exhibitions will continue to be on view by appointment only as they have been for the past several months.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Use of Funds</h3>
<p>Between now and our planned opening in late April, there is <strong>a lot of work to be done!</strong></p>
<p>By contributing to our Campaign you will <strong>help us cover the necessary costs</strong> of <strong>building and soundproofing walls, electrical and lighting upgrades</strong>, as well as upgrades and <strong>replacements to our A/V equipment</strong> including a new <strong>4k projector</strong> and a new <strong>projection screen</strong>, among others.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>We hope that you will donate to our campaign <strong>to make this possible</strong>!

<h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
<p>Microscope will remain dedicated to artists working with the time-based arts in all their forms and will be <strong>guided by the principles of inclusion, equity, and diversity</strong>, not only for <strong>the artists</strong> presented but also for the <strong>expanded circle of curators</strong> that will be involved on a more regular basis.</p>
<p>Although <strong>a lot of work lies ahead</strong> before we are able to resume operations and <strong>turn the lights off on our first event in a safer world</strong>, we are excited about this new chapter for Microscope!</p>

<p><b>Lea Bertucci's ""A Visible Length of Light""</b></p>
<p>Released April 2021. Clear 12” Vinyl LP. Edition of 475.</p>
<p>Channelling temperaments of dislocation and wanderlust, filtered through impressions of distinctly American landscapes – coasts, cities, prairie – and the sonic material of everyday experience, defamiliarized by crisis, the New York based composer and multi-instrumentalist, Lea Bertucci, delivers A Visible Length Of Light.</p>
<p>Conceived across much of 2020, A Visible Length is the product of real-time reactions to, and reflections upon, the instability of the year, distilled into a series of prescient auditory typographies that shimmer with life and hope.</p>
<p>Recorded at Bertucci’s home in New York City and in Omaha, Nebraska, during her residency at the Bemis Center for Contemporary Art, A Visible Length Of Light comprises seven condensed works – deploying bass clarinet, alto sax, manipulated tape, organ, a venu wooden flute, and field recordings made in places as wide-ranging as Rio de Janeiro, the California coast, and Dead Horse Bay – surrounded by four “Refrains” – brief, minimal segments that capture Bertucci improvising, via whispers of flute, with the sounds upfolding outside her apartment. Foregoing the long-form compositional approach that has marked her previous albums, it emerges as one of her most pointedly melodic, harmonically rich, and structurally distinct efforts to date.</p>

<p><strong>Kamron Saniee's ""Euphoric Studies (SVS017)""</strong></p>
<p>Released March 2021. 12” Vinyl LP. Edition of 300.</p>
<p>Positivity. Lucidity. Velocity. In his second solo release, Kamron Saniee presents six animated studies of concentrated, rhythmic electronica – Euphoric Studies – in search of an ""everyday euphoria"" for the sunlit hours. </p>
<p>The works are characterized by a playful yet incisive energy, harkening back to the exuberance of early 2000s post-techno experimentation. Bubbling synthesizer melodies and emergent textural grooves serve to guide listeners towards a lucid, stimulated state. </p>
<p>Saniee acknowledges his classical influences on the track 'Badinage', in which a theme by Marin Marais played back on the violin is repurposed and diffused into a radiating sonic tapestry. </p>
<p>On the 10-minute opus 'Rhythm Force', raining percussive elements and drifting, formant harmonies create a prolonged and invigorating environment. The use of overlapping meters in 'Amnion' creates a similarly buoyant energy. </p>

<p><strong>Jonas Mekas' ""Scrapbook of the Sixties (Reprint)""</strong></p>
<p>Writings 1958 – 2010. 456 pp. with 100 black/white images, thread-sewn paperback. Leipzig December, 2019. Width: 16 cm. Length: 21.5 cm. Language(s): English.</p>
<p>Andy Warhol, Susan Sontag, John Lennon &amp; Yoko Ono — Jonas Mekas was well acquainted with a great many New York artists. Born in Lithuania, he came to Brooklyn via Germany in 1949 and began shooting his first experimental films there. Mekas developed a form of film diary in which he recorded his daily observations. He became the barometer of the New York art scene and a pioneer of American avant-garde cinema. Every week, starting in 1958 he published his legendary »Movie Journal« column in the Village Voice, writing on a range of subjects that were by no means restricted to the world of film. He conducted numerous interviews with artists, some of which will now appear for the first time in his Scrapbook of a Sixties. The book contains published and unpublished texts that reveal Mekas as a thoughtful diarist and an unparalleled chronicler of the day — a phenomenon that has continued now for over fifty years. — Spector Books</p>
<p>Includes: Jonas Mekas in conversation with Erick Hawkins and Lucia Dlugoszewski, Judith Malina and Julian Beck (The Living Theatre), Pier Paolo Pasolini, Richard Foreman, Susan Sontag, Hermann Nitsch, Peter Kubelka, Nam June Paik, John Lennon &amp; Yoko Ono</p>

<p>Inkjet and Archival Ink on Linen Paper, 11 x 8.5 inches, edition of 10, signed by the artist.</p>
<p>""And in the same breath..."" explores the agency black women hold over their own existence and the fight we make in continuously uplifting our own voices. As an artist who primarily works within video, I am continuously thinking about the ways in which we intake an image, whether moving or static, accompanied by language. Over the past six years, we’ve seen an influx of shared content exposing the violence inflicted on black bodies. These videos have become so incessant and pervasive that it has made me question my own existence as a black queer woman amidst this struggle.</p>
<p>In each instance, I’ve noticed how overwhelming language can become after experiencing an act of violence. In an attempt to get back to a place of healing and self-love, I’ve had to embrace silence, and allow my thoughts to be present and fully honored. From this silence, I’ve created new language that has allowed me to speak—directly from the heart and freely without any concern or fear of judgment. — LL</p>

</div></div>","Microscope must unexpectedly move from its long-time space in Bushwick Brooklyn by the end of April. We are seeking your help to create a new home that will allow us to continue and expand our programming, especially our weekly Event Series of time-based arts, which we have been preparing to resume in-person — after more than a year online — as soon as it is safely possible.
Your support will help us transform the new space we have found near the High Line in Manhattan to house our now 10 1/2 year-long Event Series that includes screenings of all formats (film, analog & digital video, etc.) music and experimental sound nights, performance art, expanded cinema, poetry, artist talks and more.
Although it has been a difficult decision to leave our current space and neighborhood, we are excited about this new chapter for Microscope and hope that you will contribute to make this transition possible!
For those who would like tax-deductible options please visit our companion campaign on Fractured Atlas HERE.
The total amount we must raise through both campaigns is $30,000.
 
Please Note: All perks will be available at the gallery for local pickup. If you would prefer shipping (domestic or international) we would be happy to do so! Please contact the gallery for shipping arrangements and fees at info@microscopegallery.com.

About us
 

 
Microscope Gallery was founded in September of 2010 by artists and curators Andrea Monti and Elle Burchill  in the Bushwick area of Brooklyn, NY as an inclusive space dedicated to the time-based arts, presenting regular exhibitions as well as a weekly series of events featuring emerging to often overlooked, groundbreaking artists.
The main motivations for starting Microscope were to address a general lack of time-based works in art galleries as well as what we considered — and still do — as an unnecessary divide in the conversations and appreciation of works exhibited in the daylight setting of the gallery as opposed to those typically presented in the darkness of the screening/sound/performance venue. 
 

 
Through both exhibitions and events, Microscope offers new and emerging artists the opportunity for larger bodies of their works to be seen, and for rediscoveries of overlooked works by more established artists.  Additionally, Microscope is committed to increasing the inclusivity and diversity of its Series through, among others, a new group of core curators programming events on a regular basis, as well as collaborations with other organizations.
To date, we have presented more than 85 art exhibitions and nearly 600 events featuring works in moving image, digital, sound, performance, and more. Mediums include celluloid film, analog and digital video, stereoscopic 3D, 3D animation; live multi-screen and mixed media performances such as expanded cinema, A/V, 8-bit and VHS mixing; acoustic, noise, spoken word, experimental, and electronic sound; durational and other performance art, among many others.
 

 
We are excited to resume events onsite in our new space as soon as it is safe, and to continue to offer the chance to virtually attend the events online for anyone who is unable to be physically present.
Microscope always welcomes unsolicited submissions of works for consideration in future event and exhibition programming, and reviews them periodically. “Open Call” opportunities each year are also offered.
 
 

 
Microscope Gallery has been featured in many publications in the US and internationally including in Art in America, Artforum, Art Review, BOMB, BreakThruRadio, The Brooklyn Rail, Bushwick Daily, Cinespect, Emergency Index of Performance, Conde Nast Traveler, Huffington Post, Hyperallergic, La Furia Umana, Le Monde, Millennium Film Journal, New York Magazine, Screen Slate, Studio International, The Los Angeles Times, The London Times, The New York Times, The Village Voice, The Wall Street Journal, TIME Magazine, TimeOut NY, Underground Film Journal, Vice, Visionary Film, WYNC, and many others. 
 
 

Why We Need Your Support Now
We have suddenly found ourselves in urgent need of a new home. In the last few weeks, circumstances in our building have made it impossible for us to continue our operations in our current space. As the oldest gallery currently operating in Bushwick for eleven years, we are finding the decision to leave our beloved neighborhood to be an extremely difficult one.
To our surprise, we have quickly managed to find a new space near the High Line in Manhattan that with your help, will allow us to continue and expand our programming. A new location and new home for time-based artists that we hope we will be able to build with your support.
 

 
This includes our Event Series, which requires very specific conditions relating to ceiling height, wall surface space, projection distances, acoustics, equipment storage, and so forth.
Although it may seem optimistic to embark in a move to a new space and to think of the possibility of in-person events during a still ongoing pandemic, it is clear that Microscope cannot exist without a physical place. In the not-too-distant future we will finally be able to reunite again IRL! Also, as we wait for that day, our exhibitions will continue to be on view by appointment only as they have been for the past several months.
 
 

Use of Funds
Between now and our planned opening in late April, there is a lot of work to be done!
By contributing to our Campaign you will help us cover the necessary costs of building and soundproofing walls, electrical and lighting upgrades, as well as upgrades and replacements to our A/V equipment including a new 4k projector and a new projection screen, among others.
 

 
We hope that you will donate to our campaign to make this possible! Special perks are available for each donation level provided by great artists like Peggy Ahwesh, Lea Bertucci, Ben Coonley, Bradley Eros, Marni Kotak, Le’Andra LeSeur, Jonas Mekas / Spector Books,  Zach Nader, Kamron Saniee, and Ray Sweeten.
Please know that a portion of your donation will benefit these artists as well!
 
 

Looking Ahead
Microscope will remain dedicated to artists working with the time-based arts in all their forms and will be guided by the principles of inclusion, equity, and diversity, not only for the artists presented but also for the expanded circle of curators that will be involved on a more regular basis.
Although a lot of work lies ahead before we are able to resume operations and turn the lights off on our first event in a safer world, we are excited about this new chapter for Microscope!

<p>My name is Chris Ryan and my passion is
my business, Pandora’s Closet. It’s a one
woman sewing business focusing on creating clothing and costuming that comes
out of dreams and imagination. Both mine, and my clients. I create everything from wedding dresses to steampunk
super heroes to historically accurate garments from just about any period. </p>
<p>I have been designing and sewing for 17
years and have been steadily working to build Pandora’s Closet as a business
for the last 6. It has been one of my missions in this endeavor not to dig
myself and my business into debt and to build the business only on its profits.
But now I have run into an investment that I need help with. </p>
<p>I
have long married embroidery into my designs as it adds something special to
each garment that it is added to. I have
been blessed that my mother, Deborah Larson, is an award winning digitizer who can pretty much turn anything I
think of into the ones and zeros that allow an embroidery machine to do it’s
magic. It’s truly an art form all its own. What I am lacking is an embroidery
machine. Up to this point she has been a saint and has taken my piles of fabric
and sewn them out on her sample machine. It has worked up to this point, but it
is a lot of extra travel back and forth for the fabric and a huge amount of her
time that could be spent creating new designs. The time has come for me to get
a machine of my own. </p>
<p>That’s where you come in, helping my
dreams of taking my business to the next level come true by assisting me in
getting a Bernina E16, industrial embroidery machine. The total cost of the
machine is well outside of my current ability to make the purchase on my own
without taking on a large debt. I am confident that once I have the machine incorporated
into my business that the level of my designs and the creativity that I will be
able to express will make the investment one that is invaluable in allowing me
to make Pandora’s Closet my full time job and to let me leave my day job. </p>

<p>In order to make this dream a reality I
am looking for the following funding.</p>
<p>The Bernina E16 itself costs $16,000. I
would like to purchase two years of maintenance upfront in order to insure the
lifetime usability of this investment. Along with this machine I will need to
purchase the stabilizers and backings, threads and bobbins to be able to start
embroidering right away. What good is the machine if you can’t sew anything?!?
Also there are fees involved in running a campaign such as this and those are
included in my overall goal. </p>
<p>If for any reason I do not make my full
funding goal I will use the funds to place a large down payment on the machine to
keep the amount of debt for my business to a minimum. So every penny will help
me achieve my goal! </p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>What is The Future of Arts?<br/>
</h3>This is the question we raised in the last ten days.<br/>It's also the name of the community we started growing, of artists and art-lovers alike.<br/><br/>We looked at the present to explore what the future of arts and design could look like, and if there will even be a future.<br/>We came to the conclusion, that, yes maybe the arts are at risk.<br/>We came to change it.<br/><br/><h3>Why is that?</h3>
<p>The main aspect putting the arts in danger is the way the art markets work.</p>
<p>Admittedly, the striking majority of talents out there will probably never be confronted with the art markets, because they give up or give in long before they could get a chance to. And that is the first part of what is going wrong. How much earth-shattering, life-altering and history-changing art is not happening right now, because the artist behind is too busy waitressing in order to get their rent earned? <br/></p>
<p>Sadly, we'll never know.</p>
<p>What we do know though, is what happens to those who try and make an artistic career.</p>
<p>We'd like to give you the short version here, if you're more into detail, you can find it in this video (or just go on with the text if you love shortcuts):</p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fn0Yq7i9yi98%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dn0Yq7i9yi98&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fn0Yq7i9yi98%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p>Putting out artistic products can be a complex matter. Art needs to be produced and reproduced, often it will be published and promoted and you might want to organize live events or exhibitions. Obviously this all depends on the nature of the art itself, but one thing is true for all: You want to live off that art, you got to make money out of it. It's not romantic, but we all need to pay our bills. Can't live off applause and love alone. Can't work two full time jobs forever.</p>
<p>Now if you, as an artist, want to go pro, you need people to do those jobs for you. Obviously, you could try on your own. But in the end you'll, again, be more busy managing stuff in order to get your rent earned than you'll actually be making arts. So you turn to companies who are supposed to produce, publish, promote, distribute and sell your artistic products and manage your career. You make a gazillion contracts, some may get you financial advances, you quickly loose overview, but you consider yourself lucky. After all, you're career is looked after and you can concentrate on making art now, right?</p>
<p>The crooked part about this is the fact that you are bound by contracts and financial debts now, which put you under immense pressure to score a success with every piece of art you decide to publish. Your art became a product, and you got to live up to that expectation. If you don't, chances are you will be kicked out of your contracts long before they end - leaving you behind with nothing but a pile of dust to clean up. You yourself however have no way of dropping out. And even as long as you're in your contracts, the bad part is that you might be earning something, but it is just a fraction of the money your art pays off. If you're lucky, you see 10% of your revenues - if you're not, it might be less than 1%.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>How are we going to change this?</h3>
<p>We are musicians. We've been here, trying to get our foot into this industry for a long period of time. Good luck for us, we ended up in promotion dayjobs, and one of us got the chance to work in distribution for THE major headphone brand - and therefore learn of the pros.</p>
<p>We have also stumbled upon the fact that in many industries, it's a normal thing that small businesses and businessmen get together and form a society. They do that to be able to acquire bigger jobs and customers or to have a better basis of negotiation when making contracts with buyers or distributors. They stay independent and flexible, but they can compete with industry giants and be more succesful with less effort. It's a smart model which works out great for many.<br/></p>
<p>It's normal in so many industries, why isn't it when it comes to arts?</p>
<p>Of all people, artists really would want to have a network they can rely on with their career, yet stay independent and in full control of their own artistic decisions.</p>
<p>We asked ourselves: Why does no one DO this thing?</p>
<p>And we realised: We got the passion, we got the knowledge, why don't we just start!</p>
<p>In our model, artists join the network we started. Together, they run a company that takes over all the complex jobs with managing, distribution, publishing or promotion. They get a direct payout of 60% of everything they earn. The other 40% are kept to hire staff and nurture new talent. At the end of each business year, the profit is split evenly between all artists and everyone gets a dividend - and therefore everyone benefits from the overall success of the company. There is no kicking anyone out of contracts because they don't live up to artificially inflated expectations. If someone wants to leave, they just do it.</p>

<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Where We Are &amp; What We Need<br/>
</h3>
<p>We have set up key account distribution for all kinds of artistic products, we have all nessecary structures in place to get this thing rolling and our own online shop in the making. We started with a marketing campaign ten days prior to this Indiegogo campaign, and received great response. We got the first artists joining our network. The hurdle in our way is the fact that artistic and creative projects need their time to take off - and pay off. With this campaign, we are raising the funds to keep us going for six months - if we exceed our goal, we will be going even longer without having to worry about how to cover costs. Let's not let the future end before it began!<br/></p>
<p>Our goal is 50.000$ - they get us going for six months. Our expenses split up as followed:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">19.500$ - One fulltime or two parttime hands to support us for six months</span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">11.500$ - Computers, software, promotion materials and furniture which is all desperately needed</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">6.800$ - Rent for our business property for six months</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">6.800$ - A car, fuel and insurance to keep us mobile for six months</span></li>
<li>3.500$ - A little reserve for sudden emergencies to make sure we don't slip </li>
<li>1.900$ - Indiegogo Fees</li>
</ul>
<p>If we don't manage to meet 50.000$, we are still continuing with this project. Every dollar you give is invested wisely and won't be lost, it would mean though that things would go a lot slower.</p>

</div></div>","What is The Future of Arts?
This is the question we raised in the last ten days.It's also the name of the community we started growing, of artists and art-lovers alike.We looked at the present to explore what the future of arts and design could look like, and if there will even be a future.We came to the conclusion, that, yes maybe the arts are at risk.We came to change it.Why is that?
The main aspect putting the arts in danger is the way the art markets work.
Admittedly, the striking majority of talents out there will probably never be confronted with the art markets, because they give up or give in long before they could get a chance to. And that is the first part of what is going wrong. How much earth-shattering, life-altering and history-changing art is not happening right now, because the artist behind is too busy waitressing in order to get their rent earned? 
Sadly, we'll never know.
What we do know though, is what happens to those who try and make an artistic career.
We'd like to give you the short version here, if you're more into detail, you can find it in this video (or just go on with the text if you love shortcuts):

Putting out artistic products can be a complex matter. Art needs to be produced and reproduced, often it will be published and promoted and you might want to organize live events or exhibitions. Obviously this all depends on the nature of the art itself, but one thing is true for all: You want to live off that art, you got to make money out of it. It's not romantic, but we all need to pay our bills. Can't live off applause and love alone. Can't work two full time jobs forever.
Now if you, as an artist, want to go pro, you need people to do those jobs for you. Obviously, you could try on your own. But in the end you'll, again, be more busy managing stuff in order to get your rent earned than you'll actually be making arts. So you turn to companies who are supposed to produce, publish, promote, distribute and sell your artistic products and manage your career. You make a gazillion contracts, some may get you financial advances, you quickly loose overview, but you consider yourself lucky. After all, you're career is looked after and you can concentrate on making art now, right?
The crooked part about this is the fact that you are bound by contracts and financial debts now, which put you under immense pressure to score a success with every piece of art you decide to publish. Your art became a product, and you got to live up to that expectation. If you don't, chances are you will be kicked out of your contracts long before they end - leaving you behind with nothing but a pile of dust to clean up. You yourself however have no way of dropping out. And even as long as you're in your contracts, the bad part is that you might be earning something, but it is just a fraction of the money your art pays off. If you're lucky, you see 10% of your revenues - if you're not, it might be less than 1%.


How are we going to change this?
We are musicians. We've been here, trying to get our foot into this industry for a long period of time. Good luck for us, we ended up in promotion dayjobs, and one of us got the chance to work in distribution for THE major headphone brand - and therefore learn of the pros.
We have also stumbled upon the fact that in many industries, it's a normal thing that small businesses and businessmen get together and form a society. They do that to be able to acquire bigger jobs and customers or to have a better basis of negotiation when making contracts with buyers or distributors. They stay independent and flexible, but they can compete with industry giants and be more succesful with less effort. It's a smart model which works out great for many.
It's normal in so many industries, why isn't it when it comes to arts?
Of all people, artists really would want to have a network they can rely on with their career, yet stay independent and in full control of their own artistic decisions.
We asked ourselves: Why does no one DO this thing?
And we realised: We got the passion, we got the knowledge, why don't we just start!
In our model, artists join the network we started. Together, they run a company that takes over all the complex jobs with managing, distribution, publishing or promotion. They get a direct payout of 60% of everything they earn. The other 40% are kept to hire staff and nurture new talent. At the end of each business year, the profit is split evenly between all artists and everyone gets a dividend - and therefore everyone benefits from the overall success of the company. There is no kicking anyone out of contracts because they don't live up to artificially inflated expectations. If someone wants to leave, they just do it.


Recap







Why Us?
We think you can totally trust in us being the right people to get this project done. Here's five reasons why:




  Where We Are & What We Need

We have set up key account distribution for all kinds of artistic products, we have all nessecary structures in place to get this thing rolling and our own online shop in the making. We started with a marketing campaign ten days prior to this Indiegogo campaign, and received great response. We got the first artists joining our network. The hurdle in our way is the fact that artistic and creative projects need their time to take off - and pay off. With this campaign, we are raising the funds to keep us going for six months - if we exceed our goal, we will be going even longer without having to worry about how to cover costs. Let's not let the future end before it began!
Our goal is 50.000$ - they get us going for six months. Our expenses split up as followed:



19.500$ - One fulltime or two parttime hands to support us for six months

11.500$ - Computers, software, promotion materials and furniture which is all desperately needed
6.800$ - Rent for our business property for six months
6.800$ - A car, fuel and insurance to keep us mobile for six months
3.500$ - A little reserve for sudden emergencies to make sure we don't slip 
1.900$ - Indiegogo Fees

If we don't manage to meet 50.000$, we are still continuing with this project. Every dollar you give is invested wisely and won't be lost, it would mean though that things would go a lot slower.

<p>Potluck is making a second edition of their popular interactive fire sculpture, and needs your help to complete it and bring it to Burning Man!</p>
<p>Simon Fire Edition 2.0 is the electronic game you played as a kid, writ large and set on fire. Simon features a large laser cut, touch-sensitive console that allows participants to play the classic memory game. Of course, while that's happening, four large towers surrounding the players light up with 1500 LEDs each and pump out classic sound effects. And if your memory is good enough, you're rewarded with huge fireballs!</p>
<p>Simon Fire Edition 2.0 represents the culmination of years of work for our artists. We've spent years honing our skills on other art projects we've brought to Burning Man, and this is our biggest project yet.</p>
<p>We will be bringing Simon Fire Edition 2.0 to Burning Man 2015, where the 60,000 participants will get a change to play with it each night (and we hope this means you).  We will also be bringing Simon to Critical Northwest, the Pacific Northwest's regional burn.</p>

<p>Simon Fire Edition 1.0 is, of course, the precursor to Simon 2.0. The first Simon followed the same idea: take a classic game, and add lights, fire, and sound effects. Unlike Simon 2.0, Simon 1.0 featured a single tower with four individually animated light panels and a single propane poofer. The first Simon also featured an original Simon game  from the '70s hacked and re-purposed into a custom controller for Simon Fire Edition.</p>
<p>Simon Fire Edition 1.0 is where the team really refined the skills that are going into building and delivering 2.0. On Simon 1.0, we cut our teeth on wireless communications, building scary (but safe) fire effects, and more.</p>
<p>Simon Fire Edition 1.0 was featured at Critical Northwest 2013, as well as at Burning Man 2013 with two hosted events listed in Burning Man's What, Where, When event guide.</p>

<span>Visiting a makeout spot has been as American as apple pie ever since the rise of American car culture in the 1950s. In honor of 2011’s “Rites of Passage” theme, and in collaboration with the Moonrock Collective, Lake Lahontan Point appeared on playa. Lake Lahontan Point was an installation consisting of three cars with custom radios in which participants could sit and enjoy the Black Rock City skyline. Hearkening back to countless movies and television shows, it was, in short, a makeout point. The cars were surrounded by greenery and looked out upon a model city skyline that bled into the real thing in the distance. The project was in part community-funded, and also received an art grant from Ignition Northwest. Its on-playa reception was extremely positive.</span><p></p>
<h3>What We Need from You</h3>
<p>Here's where you come in. We need your help to complete Simon Fire Edition! All of the work on Simon is being donated by our artists - thousands of hours of welding, software engineering, and design work. We also have a generous grant from Burning Man that will help pay for transportation and propane (which means we can shoot fire all night long). However, there is still a gap.</p>
<p>Your generous donation will go right where it's needed most: purchasing material and supplies. Simon is a complicated project, and requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>6,000 LED lights for the towers alone - <span style=""background-color: initial;"">1,500 total watts of lighting</span>
</li>
<li>Hundreds of pounds of raw steel</li>
<li>Six Arduino microprocessors, and an ARM music processor</li>
<li>Several custom-designed circuit boards and electronics</li>
<li>Over 190 feet of propane plumbing, countless propane fittings, and 40 gallons of pressurized propane storage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your help will allow us to continue purchasing the supplies needed to complete Simon so that you can play with it!</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your support!</p>

<p>BOSH
is a process of creation of a typically different, extraordinary and
unconventional public space… A space which is constantly re-defined throughout
the urban arts, or respectively, the arts in urban context… A space which is
unique and tangible enough, dynamic and pulsing, provocative and/or
controversial… But above all, open and accessible to everyone!</p>

is an ‘invasion upon the spirit’, an act of marking distinctively, a cultural

festival usually happens during the last weekend of August at several public
venues in Gevgelija (a town at the major border-crossing between Macedonia and
Greece). During the three festival days<span> 
there will be many off-mainstream performances (professional and
amateur), such as theatre, music, poetry, films and video-art, fine art
exhibitions, workshops, graffiti sessions, and other forms of interdisciplinary
as well as unconventional artistic happenings. All events are, and have always
been free of charge…</span></p>

<p><strong><i>ART EQUILIBRIUM</i></strong> - a
local NGO that affirms the
rationale for a dynamic as much as balanced societal development, specifically
throughout arts and culture in urban context. </p>
<p>We
believe the accessibility to arts and culture is one of the fundamental rights
for each individual. And either as a ‘consumer’, or more importantly
‘producer’, throughout whose creativity and personal development, the totality
of democratic, as well as socio-economic developments are also articulated and
matured…</p>
<p>The
sensibilization to a kind of a different and in many respects more qualitative
creative expressionisms from the ones of the vulgarized triviality in the
Balkans is constantly an actual priority… Therefore, the various forms of
activism within the field of arts and culture became an inevitable
characteristic of our activities, since the very beginnings in 2009…</p>
<p><strong><i>BOSH Festival</i></strong><strong> </strong>is completely funded by
donations, sponsorships, and until recently some pitiful public funds that did
not really match the socio-cultural magnitude and popularity of the festival,
either home or abroad… However, as of the beginning of 2015, <strong><i>ART EQUILIBRIUM</i></strong><strong> </strong>openly and publicly renounced
these public funds, as these were disgracefully lowered, and thus answering the
subtle pressure by the local elites. It was another statement and an act of
anti-conformism to the orthodox political and bureaucratic establishments, for
whom sadly enough, arts and culture still remain in the sphere of calculative,
narrow-minded, muscle politics…</p>
<br/>
<p><b>HOW THE MONEY WILL BE
USED?</b></p>
<p>The funds are needed to cover the operating, as well as artists’ /
performers’ travel costs. More specifically as follows:</p>
<p><span>1.<span> 
</span></span><b>Audio-visual equipment (approx. 5.500 -
6.000 USD): </b>Though we
posses some of this equipment, it is not a fully professional one to the
standard. As for the three days during the festival, we’ll need to rent this
equipment. The best value for money we’ve found so far is as follows:</p>
<p><u>Audio
equipment (concerts) incl. stage &amp; lightning: 4.500-5.000 USD for 3 days</u></p>
<p><span>-<span>  </span></span>Aprox. some 10.000 W of power speakers and monitors</p>
<p><span>-<span>  </span></span>Quality mixer (40 channels min.) </p>
<p><span>-<span>  </span></span>Fully professional drum set</p>
<p><span>-<span>  </span></span>5 amplifiers (60-100W each min.) </p>
<p><span>-<span>  </span></span>Set of 10 quality microphones (shure, dynamic and

</div></div>","THE FESTIVAL:



BOSH FESTIVAL – is an
international multimedia platform that has been celebrating creative
expressionisms in urban context for seven years now… Or put differently, BOSH
is an attempt for estheticized articulation and deliberation of the so-called
‘added value’ to the urban culture.






BOSH
is a process of creation of a typically different, extraordinary and
unconventional public space… A space which is constantly re-defined throughout
the urban arts, or respectively, the arts in urban context… A space which is
unique and tangible enough, dynamic and pulsing, provocative and/or
controversial… But above all, open and accessible to everyone!





BOSH
is an ‘invasion upon the spirit’, an act of marking distinctively, a cultural
and esthetic ‘free territory’! BOSH is a fusion and confusion, insofar as
sensibilization and vulgarization too! BOSH is a linking-space in search of
one’s own time and needs…





The
festival usually happens during the last weekend of August at several public
venues in Gevgelija (a town at the major border-crossing between Macedonia and
Greece). During the three festival days 
there will be many off-mainstream performances (professional and
amateur), such as theatre, music, poetry, films and video-art, fine art
exhibitions, workshops, graffiti sessions, and other forms of interdisciplinary
as well as unconventional artistic happenings. All events are, and have always
been free of charge…




 
The
first edition of the BOSH FESTIVAL
happened in 2009, in honor and memory of the late actor and poet Bosko
Bozadzievski (1981-2008). It is a tribute by few of his close friends.

THE
ORGANIZER:


ART EQUILIBRIUM - a
local NGO that affirms the
rationale for a dynamic as much as balanced societal development, specifically
throughout arts and culture in urban context. 
We
believe the accessibility to arts and culture is one of the fundamental rights
for each individual. And either as a ‘consumer’, or more importantly
‘producer’, throughout whose creativity and personal development, the totality
of democratic, as well as socio-economic developments are also articulated and
matured…
The
sensibilization to a kind of a different and in many respects more qualitative
creative expressionisms from the ones of the vulgarized triviality in the
Balkans is constantly an actual priority… Therefore, the various forms of
activism within the field of arts and culture became an inevitable
characteristic of our activities, since the very beginnings in 2009…
BOSH Festival is completely funded by
donations, sponsorships, and until recently some pitiful public funds that did
not really match the socio-cultural magnitude and popularity of the festival,
either home or abroad… However, as of the beginning of 2015, ART EQUILIBRIUM openly and publicly renounced
these public funds, as these were disgracefully lowered, and thus answering the
subtle pressure by the local elites. It was another statement and an act of
anti-conformism to the orthodox political and bureaucratic establishments, for
whom sadly enough, arts and culture still remain in the sphere of calculative,
narrow-minded, muscle politics…

HOW THE MONEY WILL BE
USED?
The funds are needed to cover the operating, as well as artists’ /
performers’ travel costs. More specifically as follows:
1. 
Audio-visual equipment (approx. 5.500 -
6.000 USD): Though we
posses some of this equipment, it is not a fully professional one to the
standard. As for the three days during the festival, we’ll need to rent this
equipment. The best value for money we’ve found so far is as follows:
Audio
equipment (concerts) incl. stage & lightning: 4.500-5.000 USD for 3 days
-  Aprox. some 10.000 W of power speakers and monitors
-  Quality mixer (40 channels min.) 
-  Fully professional drum set
-  5 amplifiers (60-100W each min.) 
-  Set of 10 quality microphones (shure, dynamic and
condenser) with stands
-  Set of cables & connectors
-  2 audio technicians

Audio equipment: (films & video art) 500-700 USD
for 3 days
This equipment will be needed for producing the audio
during the film projections and video art.
-  Aprox. some 2.000 W of power speakers with stands
-  Quality mixer (8 channels min.)
-  Set of cables & connectors
-  Audio technician
Video equipment: (films & video art) 400-500 USD
for 3 days
-  3 quality LCD video projectors 
-  Standard video mixer (3 channels min.)
-  Video technician 

2. 
Travel costs, artists & performers
(approx. 4.000 USD): The travel
costs will be needed for approximately some 60 people.
-  Macedonia 30 – approx. 400 USD
-  Greece 10 – approx. 600 USD
-  Serbia 10 – approx. 500 USD
-  Rest of Europe (UK, France, Italy) 10 – approx.
2.500 USD
   

HOW YOUR CONTRIBUTION HELPS?
Apart
from directly securing the continuity and quality of the festival, your
contribution will make a real positive change in this part of the world… More
specifically, on a long run it will help stimulate pragmatically an ideal
balance between the conceptual instances as of cultural democracy /
democratization of culture, in addition to assuring a qualitative improvement
of the cultural and artistic offer at local level… 
And
as we do like to believe that revolutions happen in one’s mind first, your contribution will also have a great impact on the ideas as of accessibility to
arts and culture, as much as essential decentralization within the field. 
Finally,
it will help the affirmation of the independent and alternative scene from all
around the world, where BOSH Festival stands as a meeting
point for the people to interact, regardless of their ethnicity, creed, race,

We are a group of students at Bard College who were awarded a residency at </span><a href=""http://www.olana.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Olana State Historic Site</a><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> for the summer
of 2015. We will get to the details of the residency in a minute; first, let us
introduce ourselves. Our group is composed of 8 members either currently at
Bard or recently graduated, brought together by an interest in working collaboratively.
We are: Marion Albers, Denis Blumin, Serena Caffrey, Ethan Evans, Kai Mote,
Cullan Powers, Ezra San Millan and Susie Yugler. To read more about each individual in the collective and to see samples of our work, please visit our <a href=""http://8ofusatolana.wix.com/barc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">web site</a>.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">
</span></p>
<p>We
each study and work in different mediums at Bard, which makes the tools for
collaboration fecund. And as much excitement and passion that we each feel
towards our own respective mediums, there is as much excitement towards the
idea of absorbing the skills of others, and sharing our ever-growing
'expertise' with other members of the group. Who knows what connections will
arise when a sound installation artist tangoes with a poet on the grounds of
Olana? </p>
<p>This
opportunity to collaborate will not only deepen our individual understanding of
what it means to be an artist on this planet, but hopefully will also point to
the futility of the idea that anything can be created in
isolation, solely by the individual. Everything is the result of
a collaboration between seen and unseen forces. By accepting this idea and acting as a collection
of the vast individuals we are, we hope to create works that exceed
what we could come up with on our own.</p>

<h3>The Project</h3>
<div>
<p>The residency is the first of its kind between
Bard College and the <a href=""http://www.olana.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>Olana State Historic Site</span></a>.
It's part of Olana's <a href=""http://www.rivercrossings.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">River Crossings</a> project,
in which they invited several renowned contemporary artists (such as Chuck
Close, Kiki Smith and Cindy Sherman) to create and show works on the grounds of
Fredric Church's masterpiece. The task of our collective is to contribute
living, creative energy to the grounds by making a work (or works) over the
course of three months that will then be on display at Olana from August 30th
until November 15th with an artist talk in September. Every Saturday and Sunday
afternoon from 1-4 we will be at Olana, either in the studio they have provided
us with (right behind the main house) or running around the grounds collecting
and creating. Come visit us! This time requirement is to insure that the public
may encounter us on the grounds or in our studio and acquaint themselves with
the project. For us, this aspect of the residency is a blessing, because we
believe that revealing the process of creation is just as
important as presenting the finished product. The work-in-progress mode keeps
us on our toes, and reminds people that art is not instantaneous, but is the result of an effort stemming from many (8) directions. </p>

</h3> <p></p>The funds we receive from Indiegogo support our project in two major ways.

Some members of our collective come from backgrounds that prohibit them from dedicating significant amounts of time and effort to extra-curricular activities for financial reasons.

</h3><p></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Hello my name is Andrew Smart. I am a
professional artist, published children’s book illustrator and co-founder of
Call That Art Gallery .</span></p>
<p>I've been a professional artist for 12
years now. I started as a freelance artist after I graduated from high school
in 2003. My style is a blend of traditional and modern so my choice of medium
often varies. However, I have worked in pen and ink, and pencil (black/white) for most of my career.
I started off illustrating comic books; to me comic book art was, and still is
the definition of art. From the dynamic movement to the subtle glances, you can
always form a story even if it is not in sequential order.</p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443587131/nikovoumu5c7mvdg3rsy.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 429px; height: 556px;""/></p><p><i>Page from the comic book, ""TBD, The Death Of The Hopeless Romantic""</i></p>Nowadays I don’t stray too far from that
comic art influence, but I am broadening my horizons. I am getting more into classical
art, starting to move into color a bit, (and by the way, I have tons of respect
for colorists), but no matter what changes I like giving all my pieces that
dynamic action feel that comic book art exudes. I like to give my pieces that
“there’s a story behind this” feel that you get from comic book art. I’m definitely
still growing as an artist and that’s what I absolutely love about art, there
is always something else to explore.<p></p>
<p><b>What is Call That Art</b></p>
<p>Call that Art is a family owned
and operated art gallery.</p><p></p><div>

<i style=""background-color: initial;"">Our Gallery in Florida</i><br/>

<p>God has blessed me with an amazingly
talented family. My mom, my dad, brothers, and aunts, all have different styles
and they all bring something fantastic to the table. </p>

<p><i>""Me and the Mommsie!""</i></p>
<p>I owe a lot to my mom because she was my
first influence as an artist and her work still influences me. When I was
little I used to copy the artwork she made, then she would review it and
critique it. I’ve learned a lot from my mom.</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>Unpredictability and Spontaneity</b><br/></p>
<p>The elements of unpredictability and
spontaneity are part of the uniqueness of Call that Art. With so many different
styles and art pieces under one roof there is always something new and exciting
to experience whether you're at the gallery or at a Call That Art event. </p>

<p><b>How We Got Started</b></p>
<p>Call That Art started the 3rd of August, 2013. I
was in Florida looking for galleries to represent me. The more I looked, the
more I felt my style didn't really fit in with the motifs and themes that the
galleries were presenting.</p>
<p>Long story short we found an awesome
location right along the beach and we’ve been there ever since. Our initial five
short minutes of discussion turned into five LONG months of preparation!
Finally, in December 2013, we held our grand opening. Even though it was small
we had a great turn-out and lots of positive feedback. </p>
<p></p>Over the past 2 years we’ve been busy working hard, traveling, doing shows and getting the word out about Call That Art. We all feel that is the right time to host another Call That Art event, this time in Washington, DC.<div>
<br/><p></p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><i>Yea...That's Rufio (Dante Basco to those of you who are not Hook fans).</i></span></p>
<p><b>Why DC??</b></p>
<p>I have already been given opportunities to
showcase my art in DC at gallery shows and at comic conventions. Every time I
go the reception is amazing and I strongly feel DC is going to be the next
mecca for art and artists. I definitely want Call That Art to be a part of the
foundation.</p>
<p><b>Get to the point</b></p>
<p>Okay, I would like your help to host a two day “I Call That Art” solo art event. This show will focus on my artwork, but with your help this success will give us the opportunity to do more shows in DC as a family.</p>
<p>My girlfriend Michele (co-founder of Comic
Cupcakes and one of our artists) and I have coordinated other shows and events
in the past, but this will be our most ambitious attempt to date. From venue, to

</div></div>","Hello my name is Andrew Smart. I am a
professional artist, published children’s book illustrator and co-founder of
Call That Art Gallery .
I've been a professional artist for 12
years now. I started as a freelance artist after I graduated from high school
in 2003. My style is a blend of traditional and modern so my choice of medium
often varies. However, I have worked in pen and ink, and pencil (black/white) for most of my career.
I started off illustrating comic books; to me comic book art was, and still is
the definition of art. From the dynamic movement to the subtle glances, you can
always form a story even if it is not in sequential order.Page from the comic book, ""TBD, The Death Of The Hopeless Romantic""Nowadays I don’t stray too far from that
comic art influence, but I am broadening my horizons. I am getting more into classical
art, starting to move into color a bit, (and by the way, I have tons of respect
for colorists), but no matter what changes I like giving all my pieces that
dynamic action feel that comic book art exudes. I like to give my pieces that
“there’s a story behind this” feel that you get from comic book art. I’m definitely
still growing as an artist and that’s what I absolutely love about art, there
is always something else to explore.
What is Call That Art
Call that Art is a family owned
and operated art gallery.


Our Gallery in Florida

God has blessed me with an amazingly
talented family. My mom, my dad, brothers, and aunts, all have different styles
and they all bring something fantastic to the table. 


""Me and the Mommsie!""
I owe a lot to my mom because she was my
first influence as an artist and her work still influences me. When I was
little I used to copy the artwork she made, then she would review it and
critique it. I’ve learned a lot from my mom.

Unpredictability and Spontaneity
The elements of unpredictability and
spontaneity are part of the uniqueness of Call that Art. With so many different
styles and art pieces under one roof there is always something new and exciting
to experience whether you're at the gallery or at a Call That Art event. 


""Draw Your Sword""

""Social Flower""
How We Got Started
Call That Art started the 3rd of August, 2013. I
was in Florida looking for galleries to represent me. The more I looked, the
more I felt my style didn't really fit in with the motifs and themes that the
galleries were presenting.
Long story short we found an awesome
location right along the beach and we’ve been there ever since. Our initial five
short minutes of discussion turned into five LONG months of preparation!
Finally, in December 2013, we held our grand opening. Even though it was small
we had a great turn-out and lots of positive feedback. 
Over the past 2 years we’ve been busy working hard, traveling, doing shows and getting the word out about Call That Art. We all feel that is the right time to host another Call That Art event, this time in Washington, DC.




Yea...That's Rufio (Dante Basco to those of you who are not Hook fans).
Why DC??
I have already been given opportunities to
showcase my art in DC at gallery shows and at comic conventions. Every time I
go the reception is amazing and I strongly feel DC is going to be the next
mecca for art and artists. I definitely want Call That Art to be a part of the
foundation.
Get to the point
Okay, I would like your help to host a two day “I Call That Art” solo art event. This show will focus on my artwork, but with your help this success will give us the opportunity to do more shows in DC as a family.
My girlfriend Michele (co-founder of Comic
Cupcakes and one of our artists) and I have coordinated other shows and events
in the past, but this will be our most ambitious attempt to date. From venue, to
the food, drink and entertainment, we want this to be a “can't miss” event.



Michele Miliante, Co-Founder of Comic Cupcakes

Our financial goal is $10,000

like to have the finances to pay them for their talents!


Refreshments: Your contribution will help us make sure

be able to hire a caterer to help with the food and beverages.

course of many years. As long-time friends, Amy Lennox and myself have been
making our mark on different aspects of the art and music word for much of our
lives. Having built strong relationships with cutting-edge, brilliant modern

WY PHEE Collective is a concept that came together over the
course of many years. As long-time friends, Amy Lennox and myself have been
making our mark on different aspects of the art and music word for much of our
lives. Having built strong relationships with cutting-edge, brilliant modern
& underground artists in the US, we felt it was time to band our forces
together and make a positive impact in the art community. Drawing much
inspiration from the impact and responsibilities artists have in making a
name and scene for ourselves within an existing community, WY PHEE was born. 

We
plan to showcase our inaugural collection in Wynwood Miami during Art Basel on December 2nd through
the 6th. 
The collaborative effort is a blend of eclectic art, music, jewelry
and live performance. This diverse agglomerate was conceptualized with the
mission of bringing forth the essence of true artists and their individual
fervor by giving back to the cummunity and sharing our tremendous vibe with
hopes of making an impact in the local scene.
“That all of our artists and curators in WY PHEE Collective

– Laura Rickles; Co-Founder
WY PHEE will feature two headlining artists whose
not-so-similar styles are both magnificent and eccentric. The expansive space
makes way for large statement pieces as well as some smaller noteworthy pieces

Rounding out the collective will be a stunning jewelry
presentation by Lu-Kai whose one of a kind statement pieces have graced the
heads of many burning man enthusiasts, and G2B5 jewelry from recycled material. Both designed to suit each individuals taste and personal style. 
We are bringing all of this forth now because we believe in
our artists and their talent and the beauty that lies within each person
involved in the collective. It starts with love, and is passed on to eachother
through the light and positivity in each of us and we hope to be able to share,
even if it's a small piece, this energy with our collective and the rest of the

We are HONORED to be working with Art Cares for Kids, a Miami-based nonprofit organization
comprised of volunteers who serve children in medical settings dealing with
psychological, emotional and physical challenges. We are set to do daily raffles of select pieces by our artists, the proceeds from the raffles going to this fantastic organization.




   What We Need & What You Get

At this point in the curation, we have exhausted all of our resources as well as personal accounts. Renting the raw space has been secured but the challenge ahead lies in all of the loose ends such as lighting, sound equipment, and transportation for our artwork and equipment. We also require some miscellaneous pieces of the puzzle such as printing fliers, banners and other merchandising expenses our friends aren't doing for us already pro bono. 
We are extremely low-maintenance and resourceful and have mapped out ways to accomplish our goals for a very low budget that will not take way from the aesthetic. Our hope is to gain enough money from this fund to meet these loose ends head on and go into our maiden showcase with confidence as we showcase what we know to be truly magnificent artists.
In appreciation of our investors we have artist prints, and original artworks from our gracious artists. All of our investors who donate over $25 will gain VIP entry to our opening night event on Dec 3rd.
Works of art by our featured artists are posted in this summary and are direct examples of the works that will be received by our donors as a part of our perks. The Impact

We are bringing all of this forth now because we believe in our artists and their talent and the beauty that lies within each person involved in the collective. We also STRONGLY believe in the power of art to strengthen our community. It starts with love, and is passed on to eachother through the light and positivity in each of us and we hope to be able to share, even if it's a small piece, this energy with our collective, and the rest of the world. 

 Risks & Challenges


We seem to have a multitude of moving parts involved in this
project. One of which being the musical aspect. The challenge here is to
coordinate and get all of our artists scheduled and also equipment rentals
alligned to form a cohesive schedule. We are confident that through the use of
contracts as well as constant communication and strong organization that this
is a potential obstacle that will be overcome.
Additionally, our artists are traveling with large fragile pieces of art, travel in any circumstance poses a threat as far as inclement weather etc.
We have devised a plan where we have rented a vehicle and mapped the route
starting in Marthas Vineyard, and will be having a driver pick up the artwork a
week in advance to allow for safe travel times, a margin of error and time to get the space set
up.

Lots of stuff. I'm supposed to talk about myself in this part, but I'll try and keep it brief. I'm an artist, maker, author, costumer, actor, cosplayer, chef, and world traveler with a passionate need to learn and expand my own (and others') horizons. I also occasionally manage to make things that people like to buy. Lately, that has included a bunch of items that have to be cut on a laser. An opportunity to get a fully-functional, self-contained laser has arisen, and I did a dumb thing. Like, I talked to one of these guys...</p>

<h3>I Get A Laser...

<p>...bookmarks and key-chains, holsters, custom leather work, cosplay props, foam armor (think Iron Man), or just hours of my dedicated time to work on YOUR projects.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Why This Is A Big Deal</h3> <p>The lasers at any shared shop are exactly that... shared. I have to book time at the TechShop in 2 hour intervals per day, which is barely enough time to cut ONE of my Hellraiser lamps.  (seen here - two hours of cutting, several more of sanding, staining and gluing, and.. oh yeah, a lifetime in the Pain Dimension.)</p>

<p>Even with the extremely lenient shop hours, there are times that I need to be able to work overnight. Having a laser at the house will both free up an enormous block of drive time as well as remove all scheduling limitations. It means more products in more people's hands sooner. It also means that experimentation with new materials and the development of new projects won't have to be scheduled and limited to a time slot. This is an 80 watt laser with all the trimmings, which is the perfect power range for the wood and leather that I use most often. It's also powerful enough to really get into some interesting additional choices for materials, but it's still short of cutting metal. In short, reduced costs in time, travel, and materials can be passed on to you.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>What Happens If This Fails?</h3>
<div>To you guys? Nothing much. I will honor all orders and donations even if it means making them on TechShop lasers and within their time-frame, so if you're concerned about getting your stuff - don't be. Worst case scenario on your end is not very worst case - it just means waiting a while for me to make it through the orders. To me? Ummmmm...</div>

I have been working with the cheapest available tools from walmart and craft store, but I am now ready to take my work to the next level and go with professional tools. I was recently accepted in to the RAW organization for natural born artists, and had my first showcase. It was a wonderful experience, and I now have to get ready for the my big out of state showcase.

It's not a big one, just better tools to help me along my artistic journey. I am not looking to get the most expensive pyrography set out there, but a decent one.

<h3>I’m not from Sudbury. Why should I support this?</h3>
<p></p>Because you’ll be supporting art, cultural growth, small(ish) towns. Because this means when you take the TransCanada highway and stop in Sudbury (which is a stop you’d make), you can visit downtown, point at one of your murals, and say “Hey, I made that happen. Actually, my name is on this one!”
<h3>You Are Awesome</h3>
<p>Thank you Sudbury. You inspire us. You encourage us to stick around and to help transform this city into a place we are excited to call home. We can't thank you enough for the love and support you've given us and continue giving us. </p>

Gobelins is a film school with an international reputation of producing numerous talented teams hired by the world's leading animation studios, such as Disney, Universal, Hanna Barbera, Pixar, Dreamworks and Warner Bros. Other attendees and I will be working under the direction of Kyle Balda, co-director of The Lorax and John Coven.

</div></div>","About the Project:
TRAFO is a contemporary art space located in a former power station in downtown Szczecin, Poland. We invite international artists to exhibit in our space, including our main 15 m high turbine hall. Because we have a unique space, we are always on the lookout for unique projects. In January, we presented an exhibition from the Italian artist NICOLA SAMORI, a master of painting and sculpture whose works are beautiful contemporary interpretations of Baroque and Renaissance aesthetics. 
After 6 months of work we were able to bring together 50 paintings and sculptures from collections around Europe. The exhibition was curated around the idea of RELIGO, which comes from the latin word re-ligare meaning to re-tie or re-connect to history. Within the scope of this exhibition we also asked Nicola to create a site-specific installation for the main hall and even extended the exhibition space to include the Church of St. John the Evangelist across the street. In a collaboration completely unheard of in contemporary art in Poland, the priest agreed to show a work which was especially created by Samori for that purpose. The exhibition was a critical and popular success.Now, we want to print the exhibition catalogue.The layout is finished, the critical texts are written, and the cover designed. Now, we need your help!If you contribute, your funds will go towards:- Paying the artist - Printing the catalogue- Paying the designers- Presenting the catalogue in an official event Update!On March 27th it was announced that Nicola will be one of the artists representing Italy in the national pavilion at the Venice Biennale, the most important event in the contemporary art world. It takes place every two years in Venice, Italy. Therefore, TRAFO has decided to present the RELIGO catalogue in an official event on the opening evening of the Biennale. The private presentation will be held in the beautiful Palazzo Loredan, the current home of the Institute of Science and Letters in Venice. We are making 8 invitations to the presentation available to donors. http://www.istitutoveneto.it/visiteguidate

My name is Danielle Brensinger and I am currently a glass artist who lives and works in Brooklyn, New York. I have a passion for glass blowing and have been fortunate enough to be able to make a career out of it.</p>
<p>I am extremely excited and honored to have been given a full scholarship to attend a goblet glass blowing class with two esteemed professionals in my craft at the Penland School of Crafts this summer in North Carolina. Immediately following this two week workshop, I was offered the opportunity to assist another professional colleague with his demonstration for the annual Glass Art Society Conference which is held in San Jose, California this summer. </p>
<p>As amazing as these opportunities are, unfortunately none of it will be possible without your help. With your support I will be able to dedicate this time solely to my craft and my development as an artist. I will learn a completely new set of techniques in glass blowing applicable to goblet making as well as creating lasting contacts in my field. The entire experience would be nothing short of incredible and could only help to hone and strengthen my skills and artistic development. </p>

<p>If I am unable to reach my entire goal, the funds will go to transportation to and from one of the aforementioned opportunities. </p>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>These opportunities would present huge artistic and career breakthroughs in many ways. The exposure to so many other creative souls, as well as the combined experience both events present will lend themselves to massive inspiration and exposure.</div>
<div>I have had the previous opportunity to attend a one week intensive class at the Pittsburgh Glass Center last summer. It allowed me to make connections within my artwork as well as with colleagues and other professionals in glass craft. The instructor of that course is the demonstrator I will be assisting as the Glass Conference in California. I also was awarded an apprenticeship to rebuild the glass studio at the Penland School of Crafts this past January, which is where the goblet class is being held this upcoming summer. It will be incredible to see all the hard work myself and the studio rebuild team put in come to life in the two week workshop. </div>
<div>Without those previous experiences I would not have been offered the incredible opportunities for this summer. The ability to attend this summer class and conference will only help to further create more amazing advances with my craft.</div> <p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>As a glass blower, life is met with many unique, interesting and sometimes vexing challenges. Glass is a hot, temperamental medium that requires skill and dedication to the craft.

Any challenge faced is part of the journey and is met with as much determination and willingness to learn and overcome as any other day on the job. </div>

This book is
bringing the essence of ancient mysticism and spirituality into the format of a
fantasy novel. Mirror of Desire release consists of a deluxe hardbound printed art
book, media-rich ipad app, music album and a fulldome immersive experience.

This collaboration of
evolutionary artists spent over a decade researching wisdom books from many
ancient traditions and created maps, references and imaginary devices that will
help you visualize and understand the deeper meaning of the ancients and their
urgent message to the residents of today.

         Story by Ananta Govinda,  Artwork by Android Jones
and Vedic Renaissance  Collective: Cameron Gray, Justin Totemical,  Abhi Thati, Music by Ananta Govinda, Indubious, John
Wubbenhorst, Alex Liapin, Alan Tower, Anders Wasserfall and others.
Based on an opening book in a fantasy sequel, this fantasy saga
will take you on a journey of self-discovery, where deep philosophical concepts
will shine through amazing artwork and creative visual presentations! This
thought provoking saga will not only expand the imagination with a dynamic plot
and stunning visuals, but will also reflect onto the guidance from the ancients
to the modern man.

Weaving an intricate storyline of two companions - Kastuba and Adi - on their descent from the Timeless Realm into the world of Blu Arth, the reader will follow the
pilgrims on their quest to the Pyramid,
Self-Writing Book and then
ultimately face their reflections by understanding innermost desire of the
heart in the Mirror of Desire! 
This action plot with a multidimensional philosophy storyline
will surprise you with logic puzzles, obscure and poetic references and
incredible illustrations that will help you visualize the science of magic!
 Here is some samples of how we can convert the artwork into a media experience that invites you on a personal journey:                                                     
ALBUM RELEASEThe Mirror of Desire album release consists
of 11 original tracks unique in its
beauty and sonic quality and will be available as eco-friendly hard-copy or
digital download. 
 This production will take us back to the times when music was not created and sold by an individual track, but was structured as a musical journey of an album.Music will become part of the Ipad app, where parts of the story 
narrated by the author will offer optional background music. Preview some of the demo mixes below.                                               MULTI - MEDIA DOME EXPERIENCECurrently we are collaborating with the leading developer in 360' dome experience to create a live media show using the story, music and visuals of the Mirror of Desire. Below
 you can see a rough preview of what this can look like. Not 
intended for external use, this iphone video went viral in just a few 
days and proved the right direction of this production. All 
participants of this campaign will be notified about all further 
developments of this part of the projects as well as live dates for the 
tour.                                                       FUNDING GOALS Dear friends, we require your help in funding this project!

<p><i>This is me at age five:-)</i><br/></p>I've started this project, deeply inspired by the world famous novel <b>The Alchemist </b>by <b>Paulo Coelho</b>... and the incredible unfolding of my own Alchemist life-story. <br/><br/><br/><p><span><b></b></span></p>
<p><span><b>SO WHAT'S THE DREAM?</b></span></p>
<p><b>Step 1:</b> Creating a +200 Art Pieces Storyboard inspired by The Alchemist..</p>
<p><b>Step 2:</b> Meet Paolo Coelho to present him this unique Art Project/Storyboard and ask him a burning question I have had for a very long time: 'Shall we turn the book in a movie?'.</p>
<p><b>Step 3</b> - In the near future: start - together with (please:-)) Paolo Coelho - the first big budget Hollywood movie crowdfunding campaign to actually turn The Alchemist novel into a beautiful inspiring movie that touches hearts all over the world.</p>
<p>For those who never read the novel: read it! Do yourself a favour:-)... It's a heart warming, soulfiring, dreamchasing tale about finding yourself, loving yourself unconditionally, manifesting dreams and following your heart as a guide on the journey of life. <br/><br/>Yes I do love this book! Thank you Paolo Coelho!<br/><br/><span>The Alchemist has changed my LIFE!</span></p>

<p><span><b>MY STORY</b></span></p>
<p>The first time I've read The Alchemist, I finished it in one day. I was 21 and just moved to the big city of Amsterdam in the Netherlands. I used to paint, sing, write play instruments as a kid, but somehow I had quit everything. When I read the novel by Paolo Coelho something slowly woke up. Inspiration came in... </p>
<p><b>The visions of poems, photos, colors are emerging. When I read The Alchemist I got clear visions of art. But not only that, I saw images of a real storyboard for a movie. I remember saying to myself: I wish for this novel to be adapted into a film. </b></p>
<p><span><b>Then..........................................</b></span></p>

</div><p><span><span>Life happened; I forgot about my dreams, my visions, my idea's, my plans, my heART... But throughout the many years to follow I bought the novel as a gift for many of my dear friends. <br/><br/>When I was 27 I got into an accident in Spain, where I was drugged at a beach party. I ended up having a near death experience being unconscious for 4 hours, taken to the hospital in an ambulance. </span><span><span>During my near death experience</span></span><span>, I was somewhere else, not in my body anymore... <br/><br/><span>Voices and vague entities were surrounding me. I felt so much love. I felt back home. But I was given a choice: stay or return. Then they told me that it was worthwhile to return because I was destined to meet my twin soul and experience unconditional love.

<p><i>Bring it on...</i><br/></p>
<p></p>
<span></span><p>One night out with a dear friend let me end up on Tinder. Tinder? Really? Yes! Not my cup of tea, but in desperate times, desperate deeds. The following morning I woke up and saw a couple of messages on my phone. I opened the app to remove it. I thought this was just a typical result of me being tipsy that night before. Quite reluctantly I started flipping through the pictures. I swiped 4 times yes and a whole lot of 'no way' until a picture of a beautiful, blond haired, blue eyed man with a lot of charisma showed up I thought: wow, he looks interesting! Not knowing that at the same time there was him - who also had written a wishlist-letter so we found out later - looking at my picture saying: ""Yes, you are it!"".<br/><br/><span>We matched in the moment.</span><span> I remember my heart made a little jump and I felt excitement.Len and I chatted briefly on Tinder, I decided I still wanted to delete Tinder from my phone. So we connected on Whatsapp and Facebook. From that moment on we were chatting - not talking - for hours. Len was in Bali at the time.  </span></p>
<p><span>We felt in instant, deep, loving connection</span>and decided pretty soon we had to meet in real life sometime when he had returned to Amsterdam. </p>
<p>But...</p>
<p><span>I took a leap of faith; on December 3rd at 5 AM in the morning I went to Schiphol Airport... With The Alchemist in my hands! I've never met him... but somehow I was 100% sure! I was listening to my heart. </span></p>
<p>There at Starbucks, Schiphol, I gave him the novel, The Alchemist that was kept in my closet for so long, because I knew he was the soulmate I have been looking for all my life. </p>
<p>We sat down and exchanged our letter with the wishlist for eachother... and we could just smile...</p>
<p><span>Magical stuff, really:-)! An Alchemist Love Story!  </span></p>

WHO AM I? 
'I Am The Alchemist' ofcourse, says it all...  
          Or not? 
                          I am Naomi Hadarian
                                         Inspirational Artist 
  They called me a 'Wunderkind' 
          I drew, painted, wrote, sung, played my
                    Old piano and my dear German flute 
            Then life happened! 
                                                 Then I woke up!



This is me at age five:-)I've started this project, deeply inspired by the world famous novel The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho... and the incredible unfolding of my own Alchemist life-story. 
SO WHAT'S THE DREAM?
Step 1: Creating a +200 Art Pieces Storyboard inspired by The Alchemist..
Step 2: Meet Paolo Coelho to present him this unique Art Project/Storyboard and ask him a burning question I have had for a very long time: 'Shall we turn the book in a movie?'.
Step 3 - In the near future: start - together with (please:-)) Paolo Coelho - the first big budget Hollywood movie crowdfunding campaign to actually turn The Alchemist novel into a beautiful inspiring movie that touches hearts all over the world.
For those who never read the novel: read it! Do yourself a favour:-)... It's a heart warming, soulfiring, dreamchasing tale about finding yourself, loving yourself unconditionally, manifesting dreams and following your heart as a guide on the journey of life. Yes I do love this book! Thank you Paolo Coelho!The Alchemist has changed my LIFE!
                               
This is me now:-)

MY STORY
The first time I've read The Alchemist, I finished it in one day. I was 21 and just moved to the big city of Amsterdam in the Netherlands. I used to paint, sing, write play instruments as a kid, but somehow I had quit everything. When I read the novel by Paolo Coelho something slowly woke up. Inspiration came in... 
The visions of poems, photos, colors are emerging. When I read The Alchemist I got clear visions of art. But not only that, I saw images of a real storyboard for a movie. I remember saying to myself: I wish for this novel to be adapted into a film. 
Then..........................................



    
Some first sketches - My heART!
Life happened; I forgot about my dreams, my visions, my idea's, my plans, my heART... But throughout the many years to follow I bought the novel as a gift for many of my dear friends. When I was 27 I got into an accident in Spain, where I was drugged at a beach party. I ended up having a near death experience being unconscious for 4 hours, taken to the hospital in an ambulance. During my near death experience, I was somewhere else, not in my body anymore... Voices and vague entities were surrounding me. I felt so much love. I felt back home. But I was given a choice: stay or return. Then they told me that it was worthwhile to return because I was destined to meet my twin soul and experience unconditional love. Like in The Alchemist... ""Buy this book and give to your twin soul, you will know who it is."",I heard... I obviously decided to return.So I bought a hardcover, special edition of The Alchemist and kept it in my bookshelf for many many many years. Never felt compelled to give the book to anyone... Then one day in October 2104... I was brokenhearted and desperate and I decided to make a wishlist for my twin soul.  I wrote it all down in a real oldfashioned letter. And made the promise to myself I would only pursue a relationship with my twin soul and NOTHING less. I was ready. ""Bring it on"", I wrote.




Bring it on...

One night out with a dear friend let me end up on Tinder. Tinder? Really? Yes! Not my cup of tea, but in desperate times, desperate deeds. The following morning I woke up and saw a couple of messages on my phone. I opened the app to remove it. I thought this was just a typical result of me being tipsy that night before. Quite reluctantly I started flipping through the pictures. I swiped 4 times yes and a whole lot of 'no way' until a picture of a beautiful, blond haired, blue eyed man with a lot of charisma showed up I thought: wow, he looks interesting! Not knowing that at the same time there was him - who also had written a wishlist-letter so we found out later - looking at my picture saying: ""Yes, you are it!"".We matched in the moment. I remember my heart made a little jump and I felt excitement.Len and I chatted briefly on Tinder, I decided I still wanted to delete Tinder from my phone. So we connected on Whatsapp and Facebook. From that moment on we were chatting - not talking - for hours. Len was in Bali at the time.  
We felt in instant, deep, loving connectionand decided pretty soon we had to meet in real life sometime when he had returned to Amsterdam. 
But...
I took a leap of faith; on December 3rd at 5 AM in the morning I went to Schiphol Airport... With The Alchemist in my hands! I've never met him... but somehow I was 100% sure! I was listening to my heart. 
There at Starbucks, Schiphol, I gave him the novel, The Alchemist that was kept in my closet for so long, because I knew he was the soulmate I have been looking for all my life. 
We sat down and exchanged our letter with the wishlist for eachother... and we could just smile...
Magical stuff, really:-)! An Alchemist Love Story!  


     
                                                      Yes, it did happen:-)
 
These amazing happenings in life and love inspired me so much. I bursted almost. And the artist in me finally awoke. My creativity has been hidden for so long. I decided to create - in gratitude for all of what The Alchemist has brought me - an Alchemist inspired art project: an inspirational storyboard for the movie adaptation. So as a result +200 beautiful art pieces to share with the world.When all of the artwork is finished, I want to get together with Paulo Coelho and ask him if he would like to join me in a unique crowfunding Hollywood project to get this incredible and inspiring story about unconditional love in all theatres around the world. 


Yes, I do need a little help from my friends... 

HOW CAN YOU HELP ME TO GET STARTED?
Basicly it comes down to:

your support - this means the world to me
your inspiration - to fuel me on this quest
your (social) word of mouth- please be part of the butterfly effect and share the inspiration with your friends... 
your financial support: 30.000 dollar - so I can fund this +200 Art Pieces Project and present it to the author Paolo Coelho. Ofcourse there are some tempting perks:-)...

Did you know that there are more than 60 million readers of the novel The Alchemist? Together we could be a great force. So far nobody has been able to bring the resources together to finish The Alchemist - The Movie. I believe that co-creating together with all of us could make a difference... and kickstart something amazing!! Are you in? Wanna join?Are you an Alchemist yourself?

In return for contributions and generosity, I'm making a number of perks available within this funding bid.

Challenges
Always one of the biggest challenges is gaining sufficient funds to ensure that exhibitions are well setup.
Time is always a problem. With thorough strategic planning to cover all aspects of the show setup, this exhibition can really be successful.

<p><b>Why Plug Lamps ? <br/></b></p><p>Wooden tube, indoors, creates a sense of well-being and warmth.
 Even more satisfaction from it that it is your created lamp.<br/></p><p>Often we face a
problem: If you break the lamp, you do not throw away all the lamp, you can change only the broken link and lamp will be as good as new. Where to put a lamp, for example, during the repairs in our place of
residence, as there is no place for it in the corner between all the furniture.
How to transport the lamp when moving, as it’s possible to damage it while
transporting? How to put together a lamp that you have just bought, as it has
many complex structures, wires, screws and the manual might cause a certain puzzlement. Plug Lamps will allow you to forget these problems. Plug Lamp can be dismantled and
this is how it becomes compact and space-saving. Thus it can be easily put in a
box or in a shelf next to the books. Every module of base and lamp has been

opportunity to become a designer for a while!Story.

Wood – it is a classic
design value that has been admired and extoled in all ages for its sorcery and elegance
from one hand and its simplicity from another. We also admire, respect and love
wood. Therefore, Plug Lamps are handmade, made of oak and treated with linseed
oil. These lamps are made of
plug modules , the base and the bulb holder. Modular connections of a plug and
socket are used to connect the base and the bulb holder. The coupling system is
designed specifically for Plug Lamps needs. With this system it is possible to
simply, quickly and easily change the height and shape of the lamp stem –
combine the lamp stem modules you will get a stem shape that will appeal to you.We offer nine different
models of lamp stem forms that allow to combine more than 100 variants, this
however makes possible to get more than hundred forms of lamp stem. Plug Lamps
brings the functionality in the classic forms.
Plug Lamps operate with a large 12-volt DC power
provided by the power supply. Any type of lightbulbs that work with 12-volt DC
and fit E27 standard socket can be used in the lamp. 12-volt in lightbulbs and
lamps are used for security reasons in order to reduce electric shock to zero, if misfortune happens.
Normally a power supply are used that provides a maximum current of 1A and the
LED bulb with the power of 12W.



Specification:Stem module can be produced in numerous configurations that do not exceed the maximum and minimum diameters. Stem module length is fixed and is 200 millimeters. Stem module a maximum diameter of 70 mm, the minimum diameter of the stem ends of the module 38 millimeters and 20 millimeters from the ends of 20 millimeters.

Why Plug Lamps ? Wooden tube, indoors, creates a sense of well-being and warmth.
 Even more satisfaction from it that it is your created lamp.Often we face a
problem: If you break the lamp, you do not throw away all the lamp, you can change only the broken link and lamp will be as good as new. Where to put a lamp, for example, during the repairs in our place of
residence, as there is no place for it in the corner between all the furniture.
How to transport the lamp when moving, as it’s possible to damage it while
transporting? How to put together a lamp that you have just bought, as it has
many complex structures, wires, screws and the manual might cause a certain puzzlement. Plug Lamps will allow you to forget these problems. Plug Lamp can be dismantled and
this is how it becomes compact and space-saving. Thus it can be easily put in a
box or in a shelf next to the books. Every module of base and lamp has been
connected with a plug-in type connector, and the installation for it is as easy
as…
(We put the connector
in to the socket and turn it clockwise few times until it stops and it can’t be
rotated manually. We put a Plug Lamp stem module on the plugin and turn it
clockwise until it stops and it can’t be rotated manually.) …And that’s it.   
Why we need support?
We have high ambitions
and plans, but in order to realize our plans, we have the necessity for
financial resources. Therefore we are appealing to you for support. The financial resources we need:-To get more extensive
workshop facilities, professional equipment and tools for purchase. That`s will
allows us work more faster and better.  With better equipment, we can creat more interesting and complicated stem moduls.-We have completed the connection system prototypes. Now we need to start producing.-We need to create the website /
online shop. That`s will allow people to quickly, comprehensively and
accurately navigate our proposed product.


We respect any kind of your
support. Be it financial support or sharing of our campaign. We
love each of you.

</h3><p>For a multi-needle embroidery machine I'm looking at a price tag of $5,000 to $10,000. With this campaign, I'm asking for $10,000, since that is the ideal machine for my situation.

This machine also has a larger bed than my current machine, allowing me to make designs up to 14”x14"". My current machine can go up to 8”x12"". The artwork I currently create can have from 12-30 different thread colours, meaning I need to rethread my needle for every colour. Either of these machines would be a massive improvement on that front. </p><h3><br/></h3><h3>What You Get</h3><p>For the campaign, I will be offering a variety of embroidered patches in a few different sizes ranging from 3"" to 8"". In addition, I am offering bandanas with smaller artwork. Also on offer is a custom drawing of just about anything (within reason) made into a embroidered patch or bandana! My current machine behaves within these parameters, so the perks will exist even if funding falls short.</p><br/><p>If we hit the $5,000 mark, I will add some perks, including the ability to get some patch options embroidered onto a snapback or even a custom artwork snapback just for you! If this campaign is fully-funded at $10,000, I can add the perk of hoodies with the larger scale artwork across the back with a monogram on the front. You guessed it, this means hoodies with custom artwork as well!</p><br/><p>Now, if neither of these goals is met, I will still be delivering the patch and bandana perks.

<p>Framing the Common is am independent collective project focusing on the modern home and its conditions. It is a collaboration between young studios in four different cities with different modern histories. We look specifically at the shared spaces of the modern apartment, as paradigm to dive into modern socio-political issues such as ownership, domesticity, etc.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As an independent project that we have been running since 2014, the opportunity to show our work at the Venice Biennale of Architecture is a great event to expose the material we have been exploring in four different cities. This is the first time we can show the project in full length.</p>
<p>This project, for us, is the first in a series. So this is the best occasion to extensively show the work, share the content, expand our community community, and start our second project of the series in near future.</p>
<p>- -</p>
<p>We are invited to show the project as<span style=""background-color: initial;""> part of the TIME-SPACE-EXISTENCE Exhibition organized by the Global Art Affairs Foundation as a collateral event at the 2016 Venice Architecture Biennale (28 May to 27 November 2016).</span></p>
</div><div> <ul> <li>With the support of two local sponsors (in Bogota and Kuala Lumpur) we have gathered half of the funding needed.

</div></div>","Framing the Common is am independent collective project focusing on the modern home and its conditions. It is a collaboration between young studios in four different cities with different modern histories. We look specifically at the shared spaces of the modern apartment, as paradigm to dive into modern socio-political issues such as ownership, domesticity, etc.

As an independent project that we have been running since 2014, the opportunity to show our work at the Venice Biennale of Architecture is a great event to expose the material we have been exploring in four different cities. This is the first time we can show the project in full length.
This project, for us, is the first in a series. So this is the best occasion to extensively show the work, share the content, expand our community community, and start our second project of the series in near future.
- -
We are invited to show the project as part of the TIME-SPACE-EXISTENCE Exhibition organized by the Global Art Affairs Foundation as a collateral event at the 2016 Venice Architecture Biennale (28 May to 27 November 2016).
  With the support of two local sponsors (in Bogota and Kuala Lumpur) we have gathered half of the funding needed. We have to be able to pay  for the space we show our work in, and for our production costs. The production would be making of books showing the works of each city, showing the videos in small screens, and printing panels.
We will send and share the research and projects we have produced in various forms of booklets, books, and dossiers including texts and drawings, collection of drawings and photographs produced by the team, and expand our community.

Notes</strong>: Festival 23 is primarily inspired by the work of the visionary writer Robert Anton Wilson and the Discordian movement. We are also inspired by the great British maverick, writer, actor and theatre director Ken Campbell, who produced a stage play of Wilson's Illuminatus in 1976. The carpenter on this production was Bill Drummond, who went on to form the Discordian-inspired chart-topping dance act the KLF with artist and musician Jimmy Cauty. Cauty was also a founder member of The Orb and is now an acclaimed visual and conceptual artist. In 2014, Ken Campbell's daughter Daisy Campbell produced a theatrical adaptation of Wilson's Cosmic Trigger at the 'Find The Others' Festival in Liverpool. In many ways Festival 23 grew out of this happening, and Daisy will be bringing the Cosmic Trigger cast and crew down to F23 ahead of a hoped-for revival of the play in London and Santa Cruz in 2017. </p><p>

We also love Alan Moore, Alan Watts, Timothy Leary and William Burroughs. We love dancing, talking, connecting with others, wild ideas and making them real.

We believe in magic, free thinking, fun and games and love over fear. </p><p>

<p>I have been creating a series of paintings that began a year ago as my heart
was recovering from the painful ending of a relationship. I gave myself a project to help me get
through the grief — make a painting a day and put it up on Facebook. The
paintings were small so that I could keep up the one-a-day pace and I called it
the ""Winter Shut-in Show."" The “exhibit” lasted for a month— from March 1 to April 1, 2014—and I was <span>surprised to see that
people followed and cheered me on with this work. It felt so good to be able to connect and I was
astounded that healing myself actually helped others! Since then I've continued
with a series of larger paintings (like the one pictured above) and I have been posting nearly
a painting a week. The work is on fine printmaking paper using gouache,
graphite, and water-soluble crayons.</span></p>
<p>As I was deep
in this process of making paintings and showing them on my Facebook page, an
artist friend suggested that I apply for a show at The Woodstock Artists Association
Museum, a historic museum in the heart of
Woodstock, NY. For nearly 100 years, artists have been exhibiting in the
museum's beautiful galleries. When I got phone call from the museum director telling me that I was chosen for a solo show, I can't
tell you how elated I felt! How rewarding it was for me to go from a broken
heart to my own virtual Facebook gallery to a show in a
beautiful and historic museum!  <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; font-weight: bold; background-color: initial;"">My desire is to show this work in the most beautiful way with professional framing — AND YOU CAN HELP!</span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; font-weight: bold; background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p><p></p><h4>WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE:  10-16 CUSTOM FRAMES</h4><p>

<p>Hello, RockStar (aka Jana Mckinny)
from Sacramento CA, it’s good to meet you.<span>  I was inspired to build an art car

<p><span>Wait a what?  A 3D five pointed star, or exoskeleton, on caster wheels that rotates independently from the drive vehicle.  The drive vehicle (an ATV) pushes on a race inside of the exoskeleton with three horizontal ""bumper""wheels.  Think of it like riding a 12ft in diameter ball bearing that looks like a star.   Still confused?  Check out the <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwaDQN1nsN83dWZRRlVzbFlRa0E/view?usp=sharing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">proof of concept</a> video - staring myself of course. <br/></span></p>
<p>

Turns out that’s a tall order for a one (wo)man
show. I am proud to say that in 2014 I completed the exoskeleton - 80% of the way to epic awesomeness.  StarDust was born: a
3D spinning star. From the ground up the entire build took just over four months.  Now I am

    Other Ways You Can Help No dinerio?   Are you local to Sacramento and might light to help with the actual repairs and improvements?  You made my day!  Nothing beats soldering electrical connections on a Friday night with a friend. Send me an email and lets chat. 
Is electricity and power tools not your thing?  Make some noise and share my fundraiser!
The best way, other than donating of course, is to look for me on playa.  Lets go on an adventure to the (you fill in the blank) and beyond!",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>In addition to funding we are looking for your ecstatic volunteerism in bringing this beautiful project to the Playa.  If that lights you up and turns you on, check out some additional ways you can help support this project.   Reach out to us at registration@campmystic.org and we'll connect you to this team.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Perk Fulfillment Coordinator</b> - Most (we expect 80-90%)of the Tank Tops and T-Shirts and Art Pieces will be fulfilled on playa but for those that ordered and are not on playa we will need to ship them their perks and need someone willing to send them out the second or third week of September for any remaining unfilled orders.<br/> </li>
<li>
<b>Chief Lighting Technician</b> - We have a good idea of what we want to accomplish with our lighting and would love a tech-savvy leader to help us figure out the best ways to install it.  We've got some great multi-colored sound activated LED lights, and want to do amazing things with LED ribbon and Electroluminescent materials or other illumination that you might suggest to make this beautiful <br/> </li>
<li>
<b>Power/Generator Engineer</b> - We will need to specify how we plan on powering the sound and lighting on the Mystic flyer that is not directly tied into the bus's battery.  Any consultation and advice on how to create that power and how to run the appropriate cords to the various devices that need it would be awesome.<br/> </li>
<li>
<b>Fabrication Engineer / Metal Worker</b> - We could use additional consultation and design on fabricating the structure that will be covering the Chasis on the bus so that it is adequately mutantified (is that a word?).  Someone who might advise the project on what materials to use, what equipment we need, and how best to fashion and contract the shapes we are wanting to create ontop of the frame and how to affix them to the bus<br/> </li>
<li>
<b>Crowdsourcer / Resource Provider - </b>If any of the items listed in our itemized budget are items you'd like to donate or help us crowdsource we'd happily accept.  There are things like electric cords, lighting, xmas lights, speakers, dj mixers, pillows, fabric, spray paint, generator, tools, wood, bamboo, bendable pipe, etc that we'll need to make this happen. If you have any of these things that are just collecting dust...and not because they are being used thoroughly on the playa then reach out to us at registration@campmystic.org and we'll put them to good use and channel funds towards things we have to buy!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Build Crew</b>  - We could always use more hands onsite to help build during our week onsite on Joel Otto's ranch in Wyoming where the project is currently being housed.  We tend to make it a very fun party of a time knocking out 60-70% of the work of construction before leaving for the playa.<br/> </li>
<li>
<b>BRC Licensing Coordinator - </b>C-Rex completed an application in 2014 with our initial concept art and received great feedback from the DMV Hotties, but he sure could use another brain on our Team to help make the May 14th deadline with the most complete plans to ensure we get an approved Mutant Vehicle License for 2015 and have permission to drive it around.<br/> </li>
<li>
<b>BRC Drivers</b> - We'll need a team of people taking shifts to take this puppy out for a spin at various times during Burning Man the week of August 30th - September 6th.  You'll pick up BRC citizens and take art tours, music tours, and drive around the playa adding delight and beauty to the streets of Black Rock City.  LOTS of Mystics had an amazing time doing this on the Great Sammich Ride and that Ride might be at another camp this year so if you had fun with making people smile last year....come have fun with us again this year! We'll do a Mystic night out on at least one evening and likely a Burn Night soiree with a bunch of us...so come join the fun.<br/> </li>

 Thanks for coming to PLAY WITH YOUR DINNER at Coogan's. The response has been an overwhelming ""Yes!"" to this reading series and we are so grateful for your participation.  Maggie Low here! It's been thrilling to bring together some of the most 
talented professional writers, actors and directors I know for this 
exciting play reading series that started February 25th and runs through April 1st.
 Thanks to our generous donors, the first campaign raised $1,325 of a $3,000 goal.
 Now that the reading series is up and running, people are wanting to further support this wonderful event!
 We are re-launching here to ""pass the basket"" in order to try and reach our original goal.

<p>On World Peace Day a group of artists will assemble 2,400 cups in Washington Square park. Each cup represents a person killed by a drone in Somalia, Pakistan, or Yemen, (according to reports issued by Bureau of Investigative Journalism<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">). We will use the water from the fountain as a symbol for life. Each cup represents a vessel, a body. The piece will begin at sunrise, and end a little while after sunset.</span></p>
<p>The purpose of this installation is to create a disruption of space. We hope that this disruption will start a conversation about the disconnect between technology and reality, drone violence, peace and space. Drawing our inspiration from the bombed out buildings still standing from WWI and WWII in Berlin, and the work of the dissident Chinese artist Ai WeiWei, we invite you to help us “transform reality into a tangible experience”(""Evidence"")<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">.

<p>In order to make “Electroluminescence” happen, we need your help. Over the next few weeks we need to raise $1,250 to pay for supplies, a film crew, and producer. We hope you can join us in building this experience in any way you can.</p>

di Ascoli Piceno: amiamo i fumetti e tutto il mondo meraviglioso che gli gira
intorno, siamo convinti che non sia solo una forma d’arte tra le più complesse,
ma che racchiude in sé poesia, letteratura, etica e sogno.</span><br/></p>
<p>Abbiamo creato un<a href=""http://www.dimensionefumetto.it/inaugurazione-concorso/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> Concorso</a> di Illustrazione per giovani non
professionisti, che coinvolge il fumetto ma anche la cultura artistica del
nostro Paese: <b>“C’è un Lupin in città”</b>
prevede infatti la creazione di una tavola illustrata che abbia come
protagonista i personaggi del manga/anime Lupin the Third, e come
co-protagonista le bellezze architettoniche, archeologiche, artistiche delle
città italiane. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442668915/rf24clwqwy5ra2ivhedk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Abbiamo scelto questo tema per sensibilizzare i giovani a
riscoprire gli scorci meno conosciuti della propria realtà urbana,
riqualificandoli e donandogli nuova vita. La nostra città, Ascoli Piceno, ha
una storia millenaria ma è poco conosciuta, così sarà per molte altre realtà
urbane: vorremmo che i ragazzi se ne rendano conto e riscoprano tutta la
potenzialità del nostro patrimonio artistico, tanto maltrattato.</p>
<p>I lavori partecipanti saranno esposti in mostra per due
settimane e una giuria di esperti premierà i migliori tre lavori: per allestire
una cornice adeguata, che metta in evidenza la bellezza dei lavori e il loro
contenuto abbiamo bisogno del vostro aiuto. </p>
<p>La somma che vorremmo raggiungere è di <b>mille euro</b>: verranno impiegati per acquistare cornici dove inserire
i lavori, pannelli o altre strutture per esporli,  per l’organizzazione della premiazione, con il
rimborso spese per la Giuria che assegnerà i premi, a cui presiederà il famoso
fumettista <a href=""http://www.sergiobonelli.it/news/andrea-accardi/9577/Andrea-Accardi.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Andrea Accardi</a>. </p>
<p>Se non raggiungeremo il pieno obiettivo utilizzeremo la
somma raggiunta per coprire alcune delle spese sopra elencate.</p>
<p>Vorremmo poter mostrare al massimo splendore i lavori
partecipanti, realizzare o stimolare il sogno dei ragazzi che li realizzeranno
rendendo omaggio al loro impegno e alla città che avranno scelto di
rappresentare. </p>
<p>Il Concorso di Illustrazione è nato nel 2014, con la Prima
Edizione dal tema “Reinterpreta lo studio Ghibli”: è stata un successo enorme
ed inaspettato, con più di 70 tavole partecipanti (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10154794655900441.1073741837.117632300440&amp;type=3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">qui</a> ce ne sono solo alcuni), inviate da quasi tutte le
province italiane, da Trento a Palermo. Questa calorosa accoglienza ci ha reso dispiaciuti
di non poter offrire alle tavole lo giusto spazio e la giusta pubblicità, e ci
ha anche fatto riflettere su come il fumetto unisca i giovani, anche se
appartenenti a realtà diverse, stimolando la voglia di conoscere meglio queste
realtà, anche solo esteriormente, proprio attraverso le immagini dei luoghi che
abitano.</p>
<p>Se riusciremo ad allestire un contesto adeguato, potremo
dare maggiore visibilità non solo agli autori delle opere, ma soprattutto, ed è
quello che auspichiamo, ai particolari urbanistici meno conosciuti, da
riscoprire e da presentare ai turisti come gioielli artistici da visitare.</p>
<p>Se questo progetto vi piace, vi preghiamo di condividerlo e
farlo conoscere a quanta più gente possibile, grazie, ogni contributo sarà

di Ascoli Piceno: amiamo i fumetti e tutto il mondo meraviglioso che gli gira
intorno, siamo convinti che non sia solo una forma d’arte tra le più complesse,
ma che racchiude in sé poesia, letteratura, etica e sogno.
Abbiamo creato un Concorso di Illustrazione per giovani non
professionisti, che coinvolge il fumetto ma anche la cultura artistica del
nostro Paese: “C’è un Lupin in città”
prevede infatti la creazione di una tavola illustrata che abbia come
protagonista i personaggi del manga/anime Lupin the Third, e come
co-protagonista le bellezze architettoniche, archeologiche, artistiche delle
città italiane. Abbiamo scelto questo tema per sensibilizzare i giovani a
riscoprire gli scorci meno conosciuti della propria realtà urbana,
riqualificandoli e donandogli nuova vita. La nostra città, Ascoli Piceno, ha
una storia millenaria ma è poco conosciuta, così sarà per molte altre realtà
urbane: vorremmo che i ragazzi se ne rendano conto e riscoprano tutta la
potenzialità del nostro patrimonio artistico, tanto maltrattato.
I lavori partecipanti saranno esposti in mostra per due
settimane e una giuria di esperti premierà i migliori tre lavori: per allestire
una cornice adeguata, che metta in evidenza la bellezza dei lavori e il loro
contenuto abbiamo bisogno del vostro aiuto. 
La somma che vorremmo raggiungere è di mille euro: verranno impiegati per acquistare cornici dove inserire
i lavori, pannelli o altre strutture per esporli,  per l’organizzazione della premiazione, con il
rimborso spese per la Giuria che assegnerà i premi, a cui presiederà il famoso
fumettista Andrea Accardi. 
Se non raggiungeremo il pieno obiettivo utilizzeremo la
somma raggiunta per coprire alcune delle spese sopra elencate.
Vorremmo poter mostrare al massimo splendore i lavori
partecipanti, realizzare o stimolare il sogno dei ragazzi che li realizzeranno
rendendo omaggio al loro impegno e alla città che avranno scelto di
rappresentare. 
Il Concorso di Illustrazione è nato nel 2014, con la Prima
Edizione dal tema “Reinterpreta lo studio Ghibli”: è stata un successo enorme
ed inaspettato, con più di 70 tavole partecipanti (qui ce ne sono solo alcuni), inviate da quasi tutte le
province italiane, da Trento a Palermo. Questa calorosa accoglienza ci ha reso dispiaciuti
di non poter offrire alle tavole lo giusto spazio e la giusta pubblicità, e ci
ha anche fatto riflettere su come il fumetto unisca i giovani, anche se
appartenenti a realtà diverse, stimolando la voglia di conoscere meglio queste
realtà, anche solo esteriormente, proprio attraverso le immagini dei luoghi che
abitano.
Se riusciremo ad allestire un contesto adeguato, potremo
dare maggiore visibilità non solo agli autori delle opere, ma soprattutto, ed è
quello che auspichiamo, ai particolari urbanistici meno conosciuti, da
riscoprire e da presentare ai turisti come gioielli artistici da visitare.
Se questo progetto vi piace, vi preghiamo di condividerlo e
farlo conoscere a quanta più gente possibile, grazie, ogni contributo sarà
apprezzato.GalleryNella galleria di immagini potete trovare i vincitori della scorsa edizione e le foto della conferenza di premiazione con i giurati (Kappa Boys, Daw,Eleonora Sarti, Claudia Cocci, Maurizio Meldolesi, Fabrizio Faina) e le foto dell'esposizione presso la Cartoleria Cartarius di Ascoli Piceno curata da Silvia Forcina.Perks

<h3>THE CAMPAIGN</h3>
<p></p><p>On the 13th of May 2014 the owners of the Horse Hospital announced that the building was going to be put up for sale for the sum of £2.5 million. This untimely decision has caused serious repercussions, and although as tenants we are protected by the terms of the original lease, the last 18 months have proved to be an extremely testing time, both physically and emotionally with aborted attempts to negotiate and secure a future for the Horse Hospital and its activities, but one thing is certain with your support we shall fight to the last for what we have created here.</p><p>So far the response to our plight has been incredible, offers of help, advice and support have come from far and wide, and earlier this year we were successfully listed as a Community Asset with Camden Council. This astounding result had the positive effect of forming an indefinite halt to any future sale of the building.</p><p>However, this stressful journey has also been financially crippling, with hefty lawyers fees and a series of on going mandatory building works, and as a 100% independent, unfunded organisation now in its 21st year, we have been left with virtually no budget to put towards the programming in 2016.</p><p>So after much thought and careful planning we have devised a scheme to put all this offered kindness and generosity to its best possible use, and now we are proud to announce ‘The 2016 Horse Hospital Fighting Fund and Support Program’. This unique crowd-funding plan offers everyone the opportunity to help continue our fight, and also fund an ambitious program that actually celebrates independent &amp; community forming culture. </p><p>This recurring narrative is destroying huge sections of life in London, which is devolving rapidly into a culturally bereft corporate wasteland. It is being systematically cleansed of its cultural vitality, diversity and energy.</p><p>We define ourselves by the culture we produce, we all participate in different ways and are all ultimately accountable and responsible to protect it and protect the right of having physical spaces where cultural exchanges and community forming experiences can happen. Transformation of all kinds relies on the possibility for the most coherent and powerful radical ideas to become tradition, there needs to be room for those ideas to have a chance to be played out. </p><p>We believe the only way to respond to all of this uncertainty and threat, is put together an exciting and ambitious program of exhibitions and events that joyously celebrates an ethos of cultural multiplicity and rejects a homogenous, thin layer of sanctioned and carefully monitored culture as a defining engine, we want to address the seismic changes London and independent culture as a whole are undergoing, and what is being lost in this violent transformation. </p><p> We are aiming to try and raise £30,000 to help cover our program of contributing artists shipping, fees, travel, accommodation and build a fighting fund to assist with any future unforeseen expenditure. By helping us make this happen you will all not only be supporting our cause, but also highlighting the difficulty of every organisation that is struggling to stay afloat. </p><p>Together let’s celebrate irreverence, anti-conformism and integrity. Champion the outsider, the unfashionable, the other. Embrace the DIY, the independent, the difficult, the intuitive, the romantic and the life affirming.  </p><p>We have been inundated with amazing rewards in exchange for your donations, from rare and original artworks, to signed records, limited editions and much more, all the work has been generously contributed by artists and organizations who have worked with us over the last glorious 21 years. LOOK CAREFULLY!<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> </span></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<h3><b>THE PROGRAM</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>This program will run over the course of 2016 and will celebrate work that is embedded within broader cultural narratives, work that has a profound emotional and identity-forming significance on our lives, collaborative collectives, community forming practices, work that embodies the importance of the broadest possible access to culture across a diverse range of activity and practice.</p>
<p>The program will include amongst many other things:</p>
<p><b>The Detroit Artist Workshop + talks</b></p>
<p>The Detroit Artists Workshop was an arts collective founded on Nov. 1st, 1964 on the campus of Wayne State University in 1964 by John Sinclair, Robin Eichele, George Tysh, and Charles Moore. The Red Door was the first avant-garde and cooperative gallery in Detroit and was closely linked to the Artists’ Workshop.</p>
<p><b>Plastique Fantastique Residency</b></p>
<p>Plastique Fantastique, a collaboration between David Burrows and Simon O’Sullivan (sometimes with others, including Alex Marzeta, Vanessa Page, Harriet Skully, Ana Benlloch, Stuart Tait, Mark Jackson, Tom Clark, Simon Davenport, Joe Murray, Lawrence Leaman, Samudradaka and Aryapala), is a mythopoetic fiction - an investigation of aesthetics, the sacred, popular culture and politics - produced through comics, performances, text, installations and shrines and assemblages.</p>
<p><b>Destroy All Monsters Film Archive + talks</b></p>
<p>Formed in 1973, the first edition of Destroy All Monsters was formed by University of Michigan art students Mike Kelley, Jim Shaw, Niagara (Lynn Rovner) and filmmaker Cary Loren.</p>
<p><b>Welcome, Space Brothers: The Films Of The Unarius Academy Of Science + exhibition and talks</b></p>
<p>The Unarius Brotherhood were on a radical mission from the late-‘70s to the mid-‘80s: to spread their “interdimensional science of life” and the principles of reincarnation to the masses via some of most wildly inventive, waaaaay outside-the-box public access TV programming in America.</p>
<p><b>Events, talks and screenings:</b></p>
<p>The Zanzibar Group, NSK, The Neo-Naturists, The Source, Athena Squatted amongst many others.</p>
<p></p>
<h3></h3><h3>THE PERKS</h3>There are seriously amazing rewards on offer for your donations, from rare and original artworks, to signed records, limited editions and much more, we have been inundated by work generously contributed by artists and organizations who have worked with us over the last glorious 22 years.

<h3>ABOUT THE HORSE HOSPITAL</h3>
<p>The Horse Hospital as an arts organization is intrinsically tied into the fabric of the building and in 2004 under the imminent threat of redevelopment, we thoroughly researched the history of this beautiful building and upon application to English Heritage it was promptly awarded a Grade 2, making The Horse Hospital a slightly less attractive prospect for property developers, we hoped..!</p>
<p>Built originally by James Burton in 1797 as stabling for cabby’s sick horses, The Horse Hospital is the only existing unspoilt example of a two-floor, purpose-built stable remaining for public access in London and is now an important Grade II listed building which has operated a Not For Profit policy, and provided space for underground and Avant-Garde media since 1993. It also houses and is supported by the ‘Contemporary Wardrobe Collection’, a fashion archive that specialises in post-war street fashion, sub-cultures and British design.</p>
<p><i>Genuinely inclusive, accessible, and welcoming both artistically and socially, the Horse Hospital has not only maintained a space for what might still be called the counter-culture in an ever more formalised and even corporate arts environment; it has nurtured and grown several generations, favouring the hybrid and the unclassifiable, the risk-takers and visionaries. The central stream of any culture relies on those edge dwellers for its constant renewal. With pressures on funding, public performance spaces and the time it takes to make invigorating work, the Horse Hospital is an oasis of opportunity in a city that, while vibrantly creative, remains genuinely challenging for those without significant finance behind them.</i></p>
<p><b>Gareth Evans – Film Curator, Whitechapel Gallery</b></p>
<p>So, however challenging it has been, the rewards of being nonpartisan keepers of culture in this magnificent and idiosyncratic building have been manifold and profound. We are incredibly proud of the fact that since 1993 we have not only been fortunate enough to have shown a vast amount of amazing work by some of the underworlds true visionaries such as Joe Coleman, Helen Chadwick, Brice Dellsperger, Dennis Cooper, Cameron Jamie, Laurie Lipton, Bruce Bickford, Gee Vaucher &amp; Crass, School of the Damned, Vivienne Westwood &amp; Malcolm McLaren, Franko B, Morton Bartlett, Craig Baldwin, Alejandro Jodorowsky, Lydia Lunch to name but a few, but that we have  also had the privilege to support and introduce literally hundreds of obscure artists, performers, filmmakers and writers, who may otherwise have been denied a voice by more mainstream organisations, to an ever-growing, receptive and appreciative audience. </p>

THE PROGRAM

This program will run over the course of 2016 and will celebrate work that is embedded within broader cultural narratives, work that has a profound emotional and identity-forming significance on our lives, collaborative collectives, community forming practices, work that embodies the importance of the broadest possible access to culture across a diverse range of activity and practice.

ABOUT THE HORSE HOSPITAL
The Horse Hospital as an arts organization is intrinsically tied into the fabric of the building and in 2004 under the imminent threat of redevelopment, we thoroughly researched the history of this beautiful building and upon application to English Heritage it was promptly awarded a Grade 2, making The Horse Hospital a slightly less attractive prospect for property developers, we hoped..!
Built originally by James Burton in 1797 as stabling for cabby’s sick horses, The Horse Hospital is the only existing unspoilt example of a two-floor, purpose-built stable remaining for public access in London and is now an important Grade II listed building which has operated a Not For Profit policy, and provided space for underground and Avant-Garde media since 1993. It also houses and is supported by the ‘Contemporary Wardrobe Collection’, a fashion archive that specialises in post-war street fashion, sub-cultures and British design.
Genuinely inclusive, accessible, and welcoming both artistically and socially, the Horse Hospital has not only maintained a space for what might still be called the counter-culture in an ever more formalised and even corporate arts environment; it has nurtured and grown several generations, favouring the hybrid and the unclassifiable, the risk-takers and visionaries. The central stream of any culture relies on those edge dwellers for its constant renewal. With pressures on funding, public performance spaces and the time it takes to make invigorating work, the Horse Hospital is an oasis of opportunity in a city that, while vibrantly creative, remains genuinely challenging for those without significant finance behind them.
Gareth Evans – Film Curator, Whitechapel Gallery
So, however challenging it has been, the rewards of being nonpartisan keepers of culture in this magnificent and idiosyncratic building have been manifold and profound. We are incredibly proud of the fact that since 1993 we have not only been fortunate enough to have shown a vast amount of amazing work by some of the underworlds true visionaries such as Joe Coleman, Helen Chadwick, Brice Dellsperger, Dennis Cooper, Cameron Jamie, Laurie Lipton, Bruce Bickford, Gee Vaucher & Crass, School of the Damned, Vivienne Westwood & Malcolm McLaren, Franko B, Morton Bartlett, Craig Baldwin, Alejandro Jodorowsky, Lydia Lunch to name but a few, but that we have  also had the privilege to support and introduce literally hundreds of obscure artists, performers, filmmakers and writers, who may otherwise have been denied a voice by more mainstream organisations, to an ever-growing, receptive and appreciative audience.",0.0,1,"1 Campaign

</p><h3><b><a href=""http://artouchk.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Artouch</a>About me</b></h3>
<p>My name is <a href=""http://szectattoo.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sze.C</a> , I am a tattoo
artist and founder of <a href=""http://artouchk.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Artouch</a> gallery in HK. I have been a tattoo artist and
run my own tattoo studio for more than 13 years. In 2014, I decided to make a big
change to open an art space as a platform for talented but undiscovered artists
and musicians. Besides, making skin art I have created art in different media and
exhibited both in HK and overseas, but for my latest art project I wanted to create
something meaningful that is not just “art”.</p>
<h3><b>What is the Eco-Art project?</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>The
aim of the Eco-Art Project is to use eco-friendly products to create
artwork, and through this medium bring eco awareness to the public.
Also it reminds us that we have better alternatives for consumption that
are more environmentally friendly.</p>
<p>For this project I will use
eco-friendly menstrual cups to create an art piece to bring greater awareness
about the environment. I have also chosen this ladies’ product as a symbol to
support the "" <a href=""http://www.vday.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">V-day</a>” movement. <a href=""http://www.vday.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">V-Day</a> is a global activist movement to end violence
against women and girls. The 'V' in V-Day stands for Victory, Valentine and
Vagina.</p>
<h3><b>Why did I start this project?</b></h3>
<p>A few years ago I discovered
the menstrual cup, which offers an alternative to chemical lady products that are
both harmful to our health and the environment. Since then I have been
promoting this product to my female friends but was surprised to discover that not
many people know about it (even though this product has been on the market for several decades) . So I started to think that art could be used to spread the
word effectively … and that is how the Eco-Art project was born.</p>
<h3><b>How long have I been planning this Eco-Art project?</b></h3>
<p>I have been planning this Eco-Art
project about 2 years. Besides thinking about
what to create and how to exhibit it , I also needed to consider how to connect
the art with the two important messages that I wanted to share : <b>environment and women’s rights</b> . Since
not many women know about menstrual cups esp.in Asia, I decided last year to
bring these lady products to HK and introduce them at a regular monthly
Eco-lady event I organize at <a href=""http://artouchk.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Artouch</a> gallery. After that I looked for some suitable women’s
organizations that fitted in with my concept. I spent a while searching and
finally found <a href=""http://www.vday.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">V-day</a> through watching their talks at <a href=""http://www.ted.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ted.com</a>. Then I spent a few
months communicating with <a href=""http://www.ted.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.ted.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ted</a> and the <a href=""http://www.vday.org/homepage.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">V-day</a> people, and finally received
permission from <a href=""http://www.vday.org/homepage.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">V-day</a> so that <a href=""http://www.ted.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ted</a> could then approve the media licence for me to
use their talks in my exhibition. Thanks for the support!</p>
<h3><b>When &amp; Where will the exhibition happen?</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>For the first show of this Eco-Art
project I have chosen a special and meaningful launch day, which will be on
global <a href=""http://www.vday.org/homepage.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">V-day</a>, 14th Feb, 2016 (no coincidence that this is also Valentine’s Day),
and it will exhibit at <a href=""http://artouchk.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Artouch</a> gallery in Hong Kong.</p>
<h3><b>How long will the exhibition Run? </b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>The first show will run for a
month in Hong Kong in 2016, and subsequent ones will be organized around one
year later in different countries.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>What we Need?</b></h3>
<p>Our goal is to make this
project a mobile art show, so that it can be exhibited in different countries
in co-operation with different female artists. We believe that if more people get involved and
share the Eco-Art project idea, then that will help awaken others’ awareness towards
the environment &amp; women's rights.</p>
<p>So for the first step,
we need funding of around USD$5000 to cover the costs of 2-3 shows over the
next 2 years. It will mainly cover buying materials and cost of venues with any
surplus helping to cover costs associated with overseas exhibitions. If this
project garners more attention from the public then we shall do another round
of funding in the future. </p><p></p><h3><b>How can you help and what do you Get ?</b></h3><div><b><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Even if you are male it is a great gift for you to show you care and support your female friends and partner .</span><br/></b></div><div>We have 4 perks, available for you or your friends to pick from on the right side /pane of this page ( for mobile version ), they include ladies' products, <a href=""http://www.ecoladyhk.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://www.ecoladyhk.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ladycup , LadyP and LadyP case</a>, and also a special ""Thank you"" card designed by artist <a href=""http://szectattoo.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sze.C</a> .</div><div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453180346/fweh7effj334delwvlv1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div><div><b>Ladycup :</b></div><div>

</div></div>","ABOUT THIS ART PROJECTWhen
someone mentions the word 'art'  people
imagine expensive paintings hung in private galleries. Something exclusive,
impersonal and, most of all, distant.
This
project aims to change that and bring art back to people's lives.
Three
years ago, we have embarked on an ongoing art journey around Israel introducing  various local communities to the spirit
of  intuitive painting. 
WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS ART PROJECT?
The aim of this project is to help people to let go and freely
express what is inside their soul. This is a traveling art-journey that takes
place at sensitive and not so sensitive points of conflict, public places such
as public parks,  big central avenues in
the middle of a large cities and actually anywhere we feel inspired to place a
canvas and paint with people.
This is real  art made by real people with no words and no hate no borders or age, gender, political background, different religions and races. Just people painting and having fun together.



WHAT IS MY MOTIVATION FOR THIS JOURNEY?

As an artist engaged in healing  therapies I fell that at this day and age we are surrounded with so much madness and violence that it poisons our souls.

I truly believe in the empowerment of creativity in each and every one of us and in the power that art holds.
I want to help allow this great creative force flow freely in the hearts of people around me in order to bring them inner peace, happiness and confidence.



WHO WILL BE SERVED BY THIS PROJECT?


Success does not play a part in intuitive art.
It is not a product it is an experience and a way of thinking. If someone opens up and starts to dream or to connect creatively I will be happy and feel I succeeded.
Art is much more fun when its done together...
I will be traveling between 8 major cities in Europe  through  the summer of 2016 , painting in public spaces connecting and creating joint art along whit different artist.
The travel blog and route of the journey will be posted on Facebook, so if you wish to participate please follow me online. 



WHAT ARE YOU SUPPORTING? 

Help me raise 5,000$ and support this
journey.
This is a nonprofit project and the money I raise will help me expand
this to more places and raise money to create an art exhibition.
The more funds or help I can achieve in gathering the more I can expand this project.
By supporting this project your contribution will ensure
that I have enough funding for the following:




Travel costs: train tickets, flight tickets, renting a car if needed

Travel insurance


Cost of art supplies: paint, brushes and canvases

Gathering and producing an art exhibition

<p>We are proud and excited to introduce you to <b>Shockerz </b>:)</p>
<p>With the increased amount of use our wall sockets receive
in the modern day and age, it’s strange that our wall sockets seem to be the
one place in the home that we have yet to personalize!</p>
<p>So… what are Shockerz?</p>
<p>Shockerz are sets of unique
laser-cut face icons that stick to your wall sockets, and will brighten up your
home better than any other item available on the interwebs!</p>

be made out of <b>ABS plastic</b> (the same type of plastic that wall sockets
are made out of). They have a strong stick, but can be easily removed and leave
no marks on the sockets themselves. Shockerz also do not act so as to prevent
the regular use of the wall sockets on which they are placed. Shockerz are not
only easy to apply, but also completely safe!</p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span><div>

<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Our story</span><br/>
</h1>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""><p><span></span></p>
<p>Nati and Tommy met in design school and, in their third
year, were given an assignment to create something related to home décor that
the average person would want enough to buy during a specifically designated lunch
break.</p></span><p></p>
</div>
<div>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469724948/15822_10151376989725421_1345693232_n_cty3p3.jpg"" src="""" style=""background-color: initial;""/><br/>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><p> After some brainstorming, Nati and Tommy came up with the idea for
Shockerz. It took many sketches and prototypes, but when the fateful lunch
break arrived, they managed to sell their entire initial stock of Shockerz in just
ten minutes!</p></span></div>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469578837/Sketches_j9wafe.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>From that point on, Tommy and Nati knew that Shockerz
needed to be created on a larger scale. At this point in time, after having
gained a significant amount of experience and having assembled a complete
production and marketing team, Tommy and Nati finally received their blessing
from spiritual master Shifu. Shockerz time has now come!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>__________________________________________</p>
<h1>We Need YOU</h1>
<div>
<p><span>To cut
individually laser-cut Shockerz sets is very costly, and buying a laser-cutting
machine is even more expensive. We want to make use of a method called <b>DIE CUT</b> that will, in one go, allow us
to create many Shockerz that can be sold at an affordable price. Our plan is to
improve our models and conduct one big production run that will be responsible
for manufacturing all types of Shockerz in all of the colorz that we have
listed in this campaign. We need your backing to
accomplish this! Help us win the home décor revolution, one Socket at a time!<span></span></span></p>

<p>Once we finish the campaign, we will finalize the designs
and make molds for the die cutting process. This should only take a few weeks,
but we are taking an extra month so that we have some buffer time to work with.
Once the molds are complete, we will need only a few days to produce the
different types of Shockerz. As they are not large and light weight, we expect
shipping to be a fairly quick process, once the product run is complete.</p>

</div></div>","Hi there!






We are proud and excited to introduce you to Shockerz :)
With the increased amount of use our wall sockets receive
in the modern day and age, it’s strange that our wall sockets seem to be the
one place in the home that we have yet to personalize!
So… what are Shockerz?
Shockerz are sets of unique
laser-cut face icons that stick to your wall sockets, and will brighten up your
home better than any other item available on the interwebs!

__________________________________________What is ShockerzShockerz are sets of unique laser-cut
face icons, designed to stick to the power outlets in your home. Shockerz will
be made out of ABS plastic (the same type of plastic that wall sockets
are made out of). They have a strong stick, but can be easily removed and leave
no marks on the sockets themselves. Shockerz also do not act so as to prevent
the regular use of the wall sockets on which they are placed. Shockerz are not
only easy to apply, but also completely safe!


        
                       

To help you spice up your home décor, we
have created three unique trios of stick-on faces:
Famous Musicians, Friendly Hipsters and Evil Villains,
each with its own original and quirky personality.





__________________________________________


Our story



Nati and Tommy met in design school and, in their third
year, were given an assignment to create something related to home décor that
the average person would want enough to buy during a specifically designated lunch
break.




 After some brainstorming, Nati and Tommy came up with the idea for
Shockerz. It took many sketches and prototypes, but when the fateful lunch
break arrived, they managed to sell their entire initial stock of Shockerz in just
ten minutes!



From that point on, Tommy and Nati knew that Shockerz
needed to be created on a larger scale. At this point in time, after having
gained a significant amount of experience and having assembled a complete
production and marketing team, Tommy and Nati finally received their blessing
from spiritual master Shifu. Shockerz time has now come!


__________________________________________
We Need YOU

To cut
individually laser-cut Shockerz sets is very costly, and buying a laser-cutting
machine is even more expensive. We want to make use of a method called DIE CUT that will, in one go, allow us
to create many Shockerz that can be sold at an affordable price. Our plan is to
improve our models and conduct one big production run that will be responsible
for manufacturing all types of Shockerz in all of the colorz that we have
listed in this campaign. We need your backing to
accomplish this! Help us win the home décor revolution, one Socket at a time!






__________________________________________

Perks
Our first set of perks are three sets of Shockerz packs, both in basic
black and in another color unique to its design. We also have some cool stretch
goals in mind, as well as further designs, if we reach our goal!









































__________________________________________

How To Apply Your Shockerz
1. Peel off the protective backing

2. Stick on to any wall socket


3. Smile


__________________________________________


Timeline


Once we finish the campaign, we will finalize the designs
and make molds for the die cutting process. This should only take a few weeks,
but we are taking an extra month so that we have some buffer time to work with.
Once the molds are complete, we will need only a few days to produce the
different types of Shockerz. As they are not large and light weight, we expect
shipping to be a fairly quick process, once the product run is complete.












__________________________________________
The Teem


Tommy (top) presented at Salon del Modile Milano. Nati
(human camel) won an I.F. Design award. Together, this team assumes full
responsibility to bring your Shockerz to you in time for the 2016
holiday season! Their motto? Through rain or shine, snow or sleet, we deliver
your Shockerz!""

<p>But now this project needs to extend beyond being included as part of other group shows and instead to establish its own unique field of research that generates its own symposia, exhibitions and publications. This research has the potential to significantly interest and engage an international public on a private debate that has been going on between conventional medicine and complementary medicine for decades. This project will illuminate why keeping these practices available to people really 'matters' - maintaining our physical well-being is not enough - we need to maintain a well-being that also addresses the unique emotional, spiritual, and metaphysical make-up of each human being as all the the well-being as our society at large - as an organism in itself that is open to others and is multidimensional. As a medical practice that stretches over a millennia, Chinese medicine also offers a sustainable model of medical practice.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>We will be bringing together a collection of interactive animal automata to the playa. Ranging in height from 7 to 10 feet and powered by humans, these animals will represent over 2,000 years of human fascination with animated mechanisms. A barking dog, a pawing cat, a chomping dinosaur, and others yet to be determined, will make up the playful bunch that will awaken your childhood spirit!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494022456/y4xwjar2qzmghjvaubo6.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Just like the golden spike that marks the location of Burning Man, pounded in to the ground year after year, automata show the simple nature of a ritual. With one rotation of the lever, the machine follows a predetermined sequence of operations. The dog barks as the tail circles; repeat, repeat, repeat. Nothing changes over time; the dog’s gestures remain a tradition, rooted in its wooden design. This is the basic principle behind the Free Range Animal Automata Menagerie art installation we are bringing to Burning Man 2017.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494021695/fv459afn60lkdvm27wql.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Our idea was inspired by a selection of toy automata collected by the late uncle of one of our artists. They were recently distributed among his brothers and sister, unearthed when grandpa downsized in to a new apartment. This collection continues reigniting the child-like happiness we get from operating these toys.</p>

</div></div>","Summary
We will be bringing together a collection of interactive animal automata to the playa. Ranging in height from 7 to 10 feet and powered by humans, these animals will represent over 2,000 years of human fascination with animated mechanisms. A barking dog, a pawing cat, a chomping dinosaur, and others yet to be determined, will make up the playful bunch that will awaken your childhood spirit!

Just like the golden spike that marks the location of Burning Man, pounded in to the ground year after year, automata show the simple nature of a ritual. With one rotation of the lever, the machine follows a predetermined sequence of operations. The dog barks as the tail circles; repeat, repeat, repeat. Nothing changes over time; the dog’s gestures remain a tradition, rooted in its wooden design. This is the basic principle behind the Free Range Animal Automata Menagerie art installation we are bringing to Burning Man 2017.

Our idea was inspired by a selection of toy automata collected by the late uncle of one of our artists. They were recently distributed among his brothers and sister, unearthed when grandpa downsized in to a new apartment. This collection continues reigniting the child-like happiness we get from operating these toys.
 As a way to remember and pay tribute to family, the dog, which is the simplest automaton of his collection, is the first to be constructed on a larger-than-life-size scale. It is in his memory, and with great joy that we bring this piece to life in BRC.

But w​hat is a menagerie without a few other animals to accompany him? We are asking you for your help to make this menagerie a reality. Help us bring the animals to life on the Playa!

What We Need & What You Get
Our goal is to construct up to six unique animals that will huddle together on the playa.

Risks & ChallengesWe are driven towards delivering our menagerie no matter what could be thrown at us.  Despite our resolve, the Playa environment could be the source for the biggest risks.  Incredible wind and rain storms have been known to occur, and when they do, all things come to a complete stop.  However, we are veterans of the playa and know how to deal with the wind, water, and heat.

<p>Almost 20 years ago, I received my first camera for my Bar Mitzvah. It was love at first sight. I was so enthusiastic so I began photographing everything all the time. After a while I developed a great love for art. When I was released from the army I bought my first professional camera and a year after I opened up a photography studio and started working there. I found that my love for people and art can be a winning combination which can reflect in the photos that I make.<br/> </p>
<p>In the last 10 years I have done a lot - I have been part of so many Simchas, I have always given 100% percent of myself and got back positive feedback from all of you. Some of you even took me to photograph your moments of happiness around the world – I visited Rome, Switzerland, Colombia, France, Monaco, Panama and of countless times in New York.<br/>Today, I want to return to my roots. Why I even began all of my photographic career. The main reason is  - Art photography.</p>
<p>For that reason I chose the most natural place on earth to travel to, which is- Africa!<br/>I want to fulfill an old dream of mine and put into practice a wide photography project that will be worthy of printing as a book.<br/>A kind of project that will give me the push I need to start branding myself as an artistic photographer.<br/>My plan is to rent a special car, enter the depth of the safari in Tanzania with a huge set of equipment (high resolution cameras, VR360 cameras, variety of lenses which will give me all the range from 16 to 800 mm, a variety of tripods, professional drone and more), Rent a boat and sail along the crocodiles and the hippopotamus, from there I will continue to the beach and document spectacular sunsets and azure water with an infinite horizon, all in the most professional and artistic way, all ready to share with you, the people who always accompany me.<br/> </p>
<p>So, how am I going to do all of this?<br/>Here, you enter to the picture (literally :)).<br/>I need your help in financing this project. With your help, I will be able to use all the equipment I need in order to bring you back the most unique and  high quality photos.  <br/>I will be able to capture the nature's masterpiece and fulfill the dreams I have always dreamt of. And of course – I would like to transform my vision and imagination with the wild nature of Africa into a photograph.<br/> </p>
<p>Your biggest help will be to purchase the photos in advance. You can choose from a wide variety of financing options and receive products thanks to your help. You will get a significant discount than the usual cost of the pictures and I will always remember you as those who were with me from the beginning and who have supported me all along the way.</p>

We believe in their cause – we are one in the same and so, we work together, uniting to elevate and empower women to rise, to heal and to heal the world. 1 in 3 women across the planet will be beaten or raped during her lifetime. That’s ONE BILLION WOMEN AND GIRLS. Every February, we rise in hundreds of countries across the world – to show our local communities and the world what one billion looks like and shine a light on the rampant impunity and injustice that survivors most often face.  We rise through dance to express joy and community and celebrate the fact that we have not been defeated by this violence. We rise to show we are determined to create a new kind of consciousness – one where violence will be resisted until it is unthinkable.</p>

How are we doing this?
The 2017 Inspirational Women's Calendar, is a gateway to personal empowerment to those who buy it and for those it supports. Featuring 13 female powerhouses already reaching out across the globe in support and service of personal transformation. Sharing potent insight and inspiration, each month is an opportunity to be inspired by their work and journey with them as you are encouraged to unearth your own personal inspiration and greatness through the countless tools included. 
 
Bonus Tools that come FREE with the Calendar
To start off this year opening into motion and grace .. and ‘get ‘er done’... there is a “Get Unstuck”  Meditation. Which is amazingly transformative, and using this with the 10 Steps to a purpose-filled life, is a perfect start to the year.
How to Become the Most Attractive, Irresistible Version of Yourself eBook will help you to love yourself more!
To bring awareness of how to manifest in your reality, you need to understand that you are Living in a Holographic Universe, which is explained in this amazing eBook.
Moon and Woman: The Power of Conscious Menstruation:  his an eBook that guides to women connect with the sacred wisdom of their monthly cycle.
Did you know that your sacred parts of your body can be exercised? Well, here is a Crash course on Yoni Yoga, a powerful tantric online course that uses the yoni egg practice as the main tool for feminine sexual empowerment.  With practice, you sensitise your body. You connect deeply with your Yoni. You revitalise your entire being. You boost and harmonise your sex drive. You balance your hormones (say goodbye to PMS and menopausal symptoms). You awaken to your mystical sensuality. You start feeling your feminine power. You heal sexual trauma and you open up to a whole new dimension of orgasmic pleasure!
An online workshop to “Unleash Female Orgasms” (for men & women), because let's face it... Orgasms are more fun when they are shared! Though if you are not ready for that, you may like to start with a Sexual Healing Meditation.
And to throw in some steak knives... There are even a couple of bonus videos on:
How to dissolve threat and competition with other women
How to transform our insecurities and unworthiness in relationships as a tool for transformation and growth These 13 Women have taken the inner journey, personally encountering deep challenges and courageously risen up from the ashes, expanding and transforming and now dedicated to inspiring and igniting powerful transformation in others. Beyond their surface beauty, there is a deeper radiance and strength within.
And they are at your service... (click on their names to look at their personal sites)

<p><strong>We, at Out on Film, take great pride in our ability to connect artists and audiences and tell the stories of our lives.</strong></p>
<p>Atlanta's Out On Film turns 30 and to celebrate, we are adding 3 more days, a second venue, more films and more artists to showcase the very best that the LGBT filmmaking community has to offer.  We are one of the nation's oldest, largest LGBT film festivals and this year we run from September 28 through October 8 at the Landmark Midtown Art Cinema and Out Front Theatre. Our passion is programming great films, showcasing the talent of veteran filmmakers and providing a forum for emerging voices and first-time filmmakers.  The stories these filmmakers tell come from the heart and soul, creating a window to our culture and reflecting the struggles, triumphs and joys of the LGBT experience.  Meeting these filmmakers and artists who labor sometimes for years to tell their stories allows our audience a chance to connect with them on a very personal level.   So many filmmakers want to come to the festival and we simply can't bring everyone in.   They are terrific storytellers and bring life to the LGBT experience as only we can.  It is going to  be a fabulous festival and, with your support, it will be pretty spectacular.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE NEED</strong></p>
<p>We are adding days, films and an additional venue.  Through the generosity of our donors and sponsors such as Turner, we have those additional costs covered.  We have a terrific host hotel in the W Atlanta Midtown and some flight vouchers from Orbitz which covers a lot.  This year, we want to bring in at least 28 artists and we’re asking you to help us raise $20,000 in the next 31 days to create a little magic.  Your donation will pay for</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Travel for filmmakers and artists</p>
<p>Additional accommodations</p>
<p>Ground transportation</p>
<p>Flights are more expensive this year particularly from the west coast and average just over $500.  We want to show some southern hospitality to our international community by inviting terrific filmmakers from England, Ireland and Finland.   It is a lofty goal, but you only turn 30 once.  All of the funds raised in this campaign will be used for their travel.</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p>Out on Film creates a safe space for the LGBT community and allies to come together and experience work created by, for, and about our community.  There are many ways to view entertainment these days, but nothing comes close to experiencing our lives together on a big screen and embracing the artists who bare their souls to us.   As a contributor, this is your opportunity to make an impact.</p>

<p>Ever since I was a little kid I loved watching movies. My father showed me the movie Alien when I was six and while most kids would be scared I just wanted to see more of the creature. This sparked my passion for creature and character design as I grew up watching more films like that one.</p>

<h2><strong>Hey folks,</strong></h2>
<p>We are Amalie Gabel and Lena Mai Merle, currently studying fine arts in Hamburg and absolutely excited to tell you about our newest project: exhibition rooms cum laboratory - TONENTON.</p>
<p>When Amalie first found out that her old ""home"" and art space was up for rent again, she could not hold back her excitement and pulled Lena right into her dream to use the beautiful architecture for something magnetically appealing like an off space.</p>
<p>Thus, in search of an experimental, hybrid and risky conglomerate, the concept began to develop.</p>
<p>We are now at the point where we can say that many different people, artists, writers, musicians, art spaces, performers and surprises are craving to use the old tower and connect between each other and with us.  Let us make TONENTON the headquaters for our contemporaries.</p>
<p>Both of us have been involved in big projects like the annually returning exhibition “We take no responsibility” or “Duesseldorf ist ARTig”. </p>
<p>Now, what can you do to help? </p>
<p><strong>Donate</strong> to make the space ours!</p>
<p><strong>Share</strong> to get more people involved and visiting!</p>
<p><strong>Come by</strong> to participate and support the artists!</p>
<p>We are looking forward to seeing you there and hang out.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>All in all we will need about<strong> 5400</strong> Euros for the full <strong>rent</strong> for 6 months. </p>
<p>An edition of <strong>60 magazines for 6 months</strong> will cost <strong>360</strong> Euros.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So what we are actually campaigning here for is around </p>
<p><strong>80% rent, 10% magazine print and 10% material costs (nails, paint, seats etc.)</strong></p>
<p>The financial rest we will be innovative about: </p>
<p>We have applied for more than 30 funds and will continue doing that, have acquired financial support from the HFBK Hamburg for transport costs, as well as some kind support from private people, thus have the first 2 months of rent together already and Lena is really thrifty when it comes to haggling for great second hand treasures.</p>
<p>Also, we are being supported by lots of artists, who have donated some of their works to be given away as perks to our donators. </p>
<p>Thus, as a thank you to your kind donation you can receive everything from<strong> a thank-you mention in our magazine, over an original sketch up to an artwork, one magazine up to a subscription, 5 exclusive and one of a kind photos documenting TONENTON, as well as a thank you dinner with a tour through the space and meet and talk with the artists.</strong> </p>
<p><strong><i>We promise to make this happen- we are nomadic and can adjust! </i></strong></p>
<p>If we do not meet the goal for our rent, your money will not go to waste. Creating a space for our contemporaries is our goal and we will host the full programme!</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>The Impact </h3>

</div></div>","Hey folks,
We are Amalie Gabel and Lena Mai Merle, currently studying fine arts in Hamburg and absolutely excited to tell you about our newest project: exhibition rooms cum laboratory - TONENTON.
When Amalie first found out that her old ""home"" and art space was up for rent again, she could not hold back her excitement and pulled Lena right into her dream to use the beautiful architecture for something magnetically appealing like an off space.
Thus, in search of an experimental, hybrid and risky conglomerate, the concept began to develop.
We are now at the point where we can say that many different people, artists, writers, musicians, art spaces, performers and surprises are craving to use the old tower and connect between each other and with us.  Let us make TONENTON the headquaters for our contemporaries.
Both of us have been involved in big projects like the annually returning exhibition “We take no responsibility” or “Duesseldorf ist ARTig”. 
Now, what can you do to help? 
Donate to make the space ours!
Share to get more people involved and visiting!
Come by to participate and support the artists!
We are looking forward to seeing you there and hang out.
 

What We Need & What You Get
All in all we will need about 5400 Euros for the full rent for 6 months. 
An edition of 60 magazines for 6 months will cost 360 Euros.
 
So what we are actually campaigning here for is around 
80% rent, 10% magazine print and 10% material costs (nails, paint, seats etc.)
The financial rest we will be innovative about: 
We have applied for more than 30 funds and will continue doing that, have acquired financial support from the HFBK Hamburg for transport costs, as well as some kind support from private people, thus have the first 2 months of rent together already and Lena is really thrifty when it comes to haggling for great second hand treasures.
Also, we are being supported by lots of artists, who have donated some of their works to be given away as perks to our donators. 
Thus, as a thank you to your kind donation you can receive everything from a thank-you mention in our magazine, over an original sketch up to an artwork, one magazine up to a subscription, 5 exclusive and one of a kind photos documenting TONENTON, as well as a thank you dinner with a tour through the space and meet and talk with the artists. 
We promise to make this happen- we are nomadic and can adjust! 
If we do not meet the goal for our rent, your money will not go to waste. Creating a space for our contemporaries is our goal and we will host the full programme!
 

The Impact 
TONENTON combines the wish to claim a historical building and keep it in valuable use and intact with the possibility to give people from different countries and backgrounds a stage and meeting place to experiment and explode with opportunities to do and discuss! 
We believe that opportunities to exhibit in such magical places are rare- especially under young and art-market-outsider artists. The tower will be like a waterhole for them and our magazine a voice. 
Exhibitions to be hosted will be among others a curatorial experiment, where the invited curators will work with a fundus from artists to create a new exhibition every second day for two weeks. One focusing on painting today, another focusing on borders and politics today.Besides that we will host many concerts, readings, symposiums etc.

<h3>The birth of Razor</h3>
<p>We all have folders specially for all kinds of social networkings, right? Communication has never been more convenient, but we are not feeling closer to each other at all. </p>
<p>Massages can be sent easily in all kind of methods, but we still feel that only writing expresses our feelings the best. A fountain pen is one of those rare objects which connects our hearts and souls.</p>

<p>About Titanium</p>
<p>In case you are not familiar with <strong>Titanium</strong>, it’s an incredible metal. Due to its light weight, strength and toughness, it’s used to build spaceships and the most advanced fighter jets.</p>

$50 contribution will give you 2 art prints (Pinkston's Art Gallery)
All funds will be used to get the startup and web platform ready for launch, including business activities required to go live


The Impact

ArtBNC is a new startup that has not yet received any funding; we are well positioned to receive funding in the future, but we need seed funds right now
Your contributions will help us get to launch by July or August of 2018.
Artists are the story tellers of the world; we need you to help us launch this platform to the artists of the world


Risks & Challenges

Launching a startup is no easy task; it requires funds to make every move and step forward, and it is very difficult to raise seed money
We have already invested significant sums of money and put funds into building our platform, conducting research and developing strategies for over two years
Our challenge now is to get to launch and with your help we can do so
We are working diligently to win micro-funding with some great options in our headquarter city of Charlotte; we are confident that we will be successful


Other Ways You Can Help

We hope that we can get some artists to help us; artists can also ask other artists to contribute
We also hope that if you love art you will contribute; let other art lovers know about our campaign",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Description</h3>
<p>Two months ago, I decided to take the chance of applying to <a href=""http://nyc.theotherartfair.com/about/about-the-other-art-fair"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Other Art Fair in New York City</a>, a fair where only non-represented artists are allowed to show. To my delight, I was selected to have a booth at the show, which takes place May 3-6 of this year in Brooklyn. This campaign is to help raise funds to cover the numerous expenses involved with the exhibition including registration, shipping of artwork, air tickets and food and accommodation in NYC for approximately ten days. </p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>A bit about myself</h3>
<p>I am an architect by trade but left it in 1999 to pursue my career as a visual artist and photographer. I have concentrated on photography for the majority of my time, as it's easier to engage with an audience, but my gut instinct was pointing me to paintings and abstraction. I have exhibited off and on in various galleries and pop-up in Hong Kong, but haven't had the right opportunity to show my work outside, that is, until now, at The Other Art Fair. </p>
<p>Most people will know me by my male nude photography of Asian men. I'm really proud of the work that I did there and I still am working on that project, but to a lesser degree than before. As such, I have included some of those works in the Perks. They will be limited editions prints. </p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>How will the money be used? </h3>
<p>I have broken it down as follows:<br/>Registration Fee: $2,300<br/>Air Tickets: $1,800<br/>Accommodation for 10 nights: $2.600<br/>Shipping of Artwork: $1,700<br/>Food &amp; Beverage (exhibition and staff): $1200<br/>Transporation/Travel:  $600<br/>Staff Help: $500<br/>Total: $10,700<br/>Add 15% Miscellaneous: $1,600<br/>Total: $12,300</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Journey, The Inspiration</h3>
</div><div>
<p>When I left my trade profession of architecture, I was immediately compelled to create artwork, things which I thought was beautiful. My first artworks were monochromatic graphite artworks, but I soon became interested in painting. Since 1999, I have been painting off and on with small exhibitions, both group and solo in Hong Kong. More importantly though is that during the course of the years, I have been looking for a language of painting that speaks to me, that reflects authenticity or my own 'style'. Instead of going to an art school, I scoured Youtube and found all the inspiration and guidance I needed in the works of Cy Twombly, Basquiat, Cecily Brown and abstract expressionists Jackson Pollack, Willem de Kooning and Robert Motherwell.  I am pleased to say that the series of paintings that I plan to have on show in The Other Art Fair is something I feel very much in tune with me. </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The PERKS</h3>
<p>The Perks are listed on the right-hand side. Below, are links to the various Perks where you can select your desired artwork.</p>
<p><u>NOTE ON ORIGINAL ARTWORKS: </u></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In putting together this campaign, I really wondered what good art did for the community. For several days, I pondered on what artists gave to people and questioned whether creating art was a purely selfish endeavour, but I soon realised that this would only be true if I didn't share the artwork with others and only kept it to myself. My inward journey of investigation and internal exploration is only worthwhile if it goes 'out there'. I love to talk about my artwork and how it came to be -- from the mind, from consciousness itself. It could only be expressed in the artwork that I do. Your contribution helps me continue that journey. </p>
</div></div>","Short Description
Two months ago, I decided to take the chance of applying to The Other Art Fair in New York City, a fair where only non-represented artists are allowed to show. To my delight, I was selected to have a booth at the show, which takes place May 3-6 of this year in Brooklyn. This campaign is to help raise funds to cover the numerous expenses involved with the exhibition including registration, shipping of artwork, air tickets and food and accommodation in NYC for approximately ten days. 

 
A bit about myself
I am an architect by trade but left it in 1999 to pursue my career as a visual artist and photographer. I have concentrated on photography for the majority of my time, as it's easier to engage with an audience, but my gut instinct was pointing me to paintings and abstraction. I have exhibited off and on in various galleries and pop-up in Hong Kong, but haven't had the right opportunity to show my work outside, that is, until now, at The Other Art Fair. 
Most people will know me by my male nude photography of Asian men. I'm really proud of the work that I did there and I still am working on that project, but to a lesser degree than before. As such, I have included some of those works in the Perks. They will be limited editions prints. 

 
How will the money be used? 
I have broken it down as follows:Registration Fee: $2,300Air Tickets: $1,800Accommodation for 10 nights: $2.600Shipping of Artwork: $1,700Food & Beverage (exhibition and staff): $1200Transporation/Travel:  $600Staff Help: $500Total: $10,700Add 15% Miscellaneous: $1,600Total: $12,300
 
The Journey, The Inspiration

When I left my trade profession of architecture, I was immediately compelled to create artwork, things which I thought was beautiful. My first artworks were monochromatic graphite artworks, but I soon became interested in painting. Since 1999, I have been painting off and on with small exhibitions, both group and solo in Hong Kong. More importantly though is that during the course of the years, I have been looking for a language of painting that speaks to me, that reflects authenticity or my own 'style'. Instead of going to an art school, I scoured Youtube and found all the inspiration and guidance I needed in the works of Cy Twombly, Basquiat, Cecily Brown and abstract expressionists Jackson Pollack, Willem de Kooning and Robert Motherwell.  I am pleased to say that the series of paintings that I plan to have on show in The Other Art Fair is something I feel very much in tune with me. 
 
The PERKS
The Perks are listed on the right-hand side. Below, are links to the various Perks where you can select your desired artwork.
NOTE ON ORIGINAL ARTWORKS: 
Once an original artwork is selected, meaning it was purchased, I will place word SOLD in the description. So the earlier you buy, the more selection you have.
- MISHSMASH A5 Doodle Drawings
- Hard:Rewired artworks in Series A, B, and C. 
 
MISHMASH A5 Drawing Doodles
Quirky and fun quick A5 doodles. Let it go! I have selected 20 drawings from my MISHMASH collection. These are one-off drawings, so if you choose this Perk, the first-comers will get their choice first. Click on the image below and come back here to purchase.

Hard:Rewired (Series A, B, C)
The artworks offered here were created shortly after a dog bite. The incident came as a negative setback on what I was working on, but also pushed me to further pursue my artwork with more fervour, releasing or revealing a part of my self that surfaced in the artworks that I have created. They can be seen as art therapy, to which I transferred the pain into what I was working on. See the selection of artwork by clicking on the link below.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Architect Dan Brunn's '<a href=""https://www.bridgehousela.com/home/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bridge House</a>,' currently under construction in Los Angeles, is an innovative new residence that ties together breakthrough advancements in construction and sustainability technologies to exemplify the future of home building. The result: a modular, net-zero energy, and visually striking home that exists in harmony with the natural brook it literally bridges.<br/><br/>Inspired by the minimalist aesthetic, dynamic spatial choreography, and trailblazing techniques of Brunn's design, we—the <strong>LEGO artists</strong> at <a href=""http://www.cbdbespoke.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Cornerstone Brick Designs</a>—have decided to embark on a project of similar magnitude to Bridge House.</p>
<p>Our goal: a <strong>17.5-foot-long, 102,439 piece</strong> model of Bridge House, meticulously designed to fully replicate the architecture of the eventual, finished house. Everything from the panoramic windows to the solar panels on the roof will be captured in brick form. </p>
<p>Our ambition has not gone unnoticed. Already, our LEGO model is set to be displayed at the <a href=""https://www.dwellondesign.com/en/home.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dwell on Design</a> expo in Los Angeles from April 5-7. We've also reached out to Dan Brunn Architecture, which is tremendously excited by the replica project, and has given us access to the designs and agreed to let us construct the model <i>inside</i> the real Bridge House! </p>
<p>This is where you come in. Donate, and you can make your mark on what will become a monumental replica. Find out more below.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We must raise at least <strong>$25,000</strong> to get this enormous replica ready for its big debut in less than a month!</p>
<p>Money you contribute goes primarily towards buying <strong>LEGO bricks</strong>. While bricks are usually sold for around $0.10 per piece, more than <strong>100,000</strong> of them (plus shipping) cost a lot of money! Other costs include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Engraving</strong> on bricks</li>
<li>
<strong>Plexiglass</strong> for the huge windows</li>
<li>Manufacturing &amp; shipping our <strong>reward items</strong>
</li>
<li>Hourly wages for <strong>additional builders</strong>.</li>

<h3>What You Get</h3>
