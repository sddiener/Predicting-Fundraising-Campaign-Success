<h3>The Ornament</h3>
<p>""Pomegranate"" is used in our designs for this campaign which is traditionally used in Uzbek handcrafts and carries symbolic meaning of prosperity and fertility in many cultures and religions. It symbolizes the soul’s immortality and the perfection of nature in Zoroastrian religion.</p>
<p>We can encounter pomegranate as the symbol of eternal life and the Doom’s Day in Virgin Mary’s and Jesus’ statues throughout the Christian world.</p>
<p>Kabbala reveres the pomegranate in many of its rituals; their followers “burst” a pomegranate at home and in work places on religious days to call for fertility and lucrative businesses.</p>
<p>Also, newly weds in Anatolia and the Middle East are still served pomegranates to bless them with a lot of offspring.</p>
<p>For Muslims, the pomegranate is also a symbol of beauty, it is said to give beauty to those who eat it. Prophet Mohammed has advised pregnant women to eat pomegranates if they wanted beautiful children.</p>
<h3>Production of Silk in Uzbekistan </h3>
<p>Production of silk has been part of Uzbek culture for thousands of years. Ferghana Valley, in eastern Uzbekistan, is the epicentre of silk. Ancient cities of Samarkand and Bukhara also known as Shining Pearl of the Silk Road were historically one of the most important citices of the Silk Road. Uzbekistan is currently the world’s third largest silk producer. Uzbek silk has been used by fashion houses of the world, including Balenciaga, Etro and Oscar De la Renta. </p>

True world time watches traditionally cost upwards of $5,000 to $20,000, however we devised a new kind of solution. Using a clever dual-layer rotating disc system, we are able to reverse engineer the first quartz hybrid world timer using a Swiss GMT movement.This isn’t our first rodeo. The World Traveller will be our fourth watch collection to be created by Kickstarter. Our quality, transparency, & pricing is second to none - we offer full warranties & communicate our production process from beginning to end.
  We’re using the best materials and components we can find to build an excessively quality watch- Italian Natural Calf Leather, Swiss Movement, and 316L Stainless Steel Case with Oyster Bezel.FLUTED BEZELThe case is to be sandblasted first, to have all the edges softened, but also brushed on the fluted oyster bezel, to offer a distinct surface. A fluted bezel, such as on a Rolex, practically doubles the available flat polished surface area on the bezel. Allowing not only a greater surface for light refraction, but also the ability to reflect light from different angles at the same time.
 
 
 Featuring Single Layer Superluminova C3
 
 
 For the past 5 years we have chose to work with an established watch manufacturing group known for rigorous quality control. We have a great relationship with our manufacturing partners. We've thoroughly toured their facility multiple times and they are completely aligned with our goals. In 2017, they revamped all their facilities with the latest manufacturing equipment and processes.With multiple stages in the manufacture and quality check process, we are confident in their ability to deliver a quality product. We were impressed with their sophisticated manufacture process including different rooms for assembly, air pressure checkpoints, water pressure stations, 48-hour timekeeping accuracy test, and (of course) a drop test. All of their facilities meet all necessary regulation and code for operation.Though they host the manufacturing of many large retail brands, the general managers made sure all of our requirements were met and accommodated. Their experienced staff and attention to detail was what made our decision to choose them so easy. We, at Elliot Havok, are extremely confident they will meet our needs.We will offer the Havok watch at wholesale pricing with radical transparency. Not only should the watch be priced so that nobody breaks their bank, but what goes into the watch should be disclosed.By delivering directly to YOU, we can cut out all the middlemen markups.SPECIFICATIONS:

But these are patchwork solutions!The alternative is to go into the exclusive lingerie stores and buy a style for over 200 USD. The trouble is that they don’t focus on shapewear either. Most of these brands still use polyester and contain too low a percentage of spandex, because they have not yet managed to make it comfortable while providing a strong shaping effect. In addition, you often have to spend a lot of money to be allowed to wear their logo. No matter which solution you go with, the same questions come up again and again. Where is the sustainability? Where is the functionality combined with comfort? The answer is quite simple; it does not exist.The more we visited supermarkets and lingerie stores, and the more we trawled the market, the clearer it became that there was a need for a sustainable, comfortable, effective and affordable shapewear brand! SHABES is danish design and quality at its best. Created in collaboration with top of their field danish designers and produced in a sustainable way with sustainable material. SHABES accentuates your body's feminine curves in the most flattering way allowing you to feel hot, confident and relaxed, no matter what body type you have, what you wear or where you are. SHABES is created for the modern woman. You, who do not want to compromise on materials or quality. You, who want shapewear with lots of comfort and optimal functionality.    We wanted to be the best at shaping.We listened to the people around us and learned from the best in their respective fields. Of the two years it took us to reach this point, we spent one of them choosing our materials.      Together with our European manufacturer, we searched for the right elastane to form the foundation of our first collection, SHABES YOUR CONFIDENCE. We found LYCRA® BEAUTY and it instantly became our choice.LYCRA® BEAUTY is made to achieve a higher standard within shaping and we have implemented it in our shapewear for just that reason. Providing support and sculpting simultaneously – without discomfort – is what we want to do. It’s time to challenge traditional beauty standards, and LYCRA® BEAUTY is an important part of our attempt to do this.   From the very beginning, we knew that we wanted to make shapewear sustainable without compromising functionality or comfort. Two years later, we have done just that.Our certified Eco-Care® yarn truly is a breakthrough in yarn engineering and production. The sustainable nylon minimises waste and reduces energy consumption, caring for the environment, while retaining the properties of virgin fibres, allowing full functionality for our shapewear.   We paid attention to the details and knew what we wanted our shapewear to stand for.Our nylon 6.6 is among the finest and most delicate yarns in the world. For our vision to come true, we needed a super-fine yarn containing the properties of softness, durability, stretchability and a long lifespan to comply with the attributes of our top-quality Eco-Care® nylon and our LYCRA® BEAUTY.The nylon 6.6 in our shapewear is a mid-denier yarn and is often used in sports and outwear.It has proven extremely effective and contains good physical properties such as high strength, excellent stability and a good abrasion resistance. All things we need to make our shapewear bring out the confidence and smiles in woman around the world.“SHABES is not fast fashion. And we will never be fast fashion. We are a company with core values. We will produce our products under environmentally-friendly and orderly conditions. We will never stop innovating on our styles, and we are constantly working on new and sustainable initiatives”.– The team behind SHABESThroughout our value chain we are sending a message. Not only do we have a vision to make great shapewear, but we want to make it in a sustainable and eco-friendly way.  To do that, we needed not only to make a big part of our product sustainable, but also to produce them in a sustainable way with a green source of energy and under European standards. Finding a manufacturer that possessed the required know-how to produce the shapewear we visualised in this manner wasn’t easy, but we are very happy to have found the best fit. Our factory is based in Europe and is a certified green manufacturer with up to 80% of all energy used coming from solar panels. Like us, they work constantly to be better for the environment, for example by implementing more recyclable textiles to replace the 100% synthetic ones. As you know, the vision with SHABES is to make the world's best shapewear.It is not a day-to-day task. Making shapewear is a declaration of love. Because it is complicated, and you have to want it. We will produce our products under environmentally-friendly and European conditions. We will never stop innovating on our styles, and we are constantly working on new and sustainable initiatives.SHABES is a company with core values. But to realize our vision, we need your pledge!Back our campaign today, and help us support woman around the world.  For a long time, we were looking for a team that could help realise our vision, and we found a team of four designers who, like us, believed in and shared the vision of the perfect shapewear for all body types.Our development of the first collection, SHABES YOUR CONFIDENCE, took us just under two years to complete. The best part of the journey was, without a doubt, when we produced our first prototypes. It was a milestone and lifted the spirits of the whole team. Now it was real. We had testers and collaborators in our clothes for several weeks to go in-depth with the construction, and they were corrected and sewn and corrected again – and today, two years wiser, we have our finished product. This is the team behind.",27.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>“Simplicity in design isn’t just about removing the visually superfluous elements. It’s about creating a product to last. One that doesn’t need to ebb and flow with ever-changing trends or fashions. <strong>Simplicity in design, can make a product timeless.</strong>”</p>

<p>25 years ago Hannes Wettstein (a young Zurich designer at the time) put forward a unique proposal to ventura...</p>
<p>The aesthetic appearance of the proposed watch would be defined by the functional, technical and material characteristics. The properties of the <strong>pure titanium</strong> would determine the form. The dial layout should be functional, reduced to its essential elements. The only item to be left undetermined was the watch’s price; the aim was to produce a watch from the best materials, free from any cost pressures. </p>

<p>3 years ago, Stephan Hürlemann, a close friend and colleague of Hannes Wettstein, set out to reconstruct the revered v-matic EGO. For Stephan it was a labour of love, which saw him spend numerous hours at the Museum für Gestaltung Zürich where the ventura archives are located.

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Lab Tested Safe &amp; Ozone-Free (Video Proof)</h3>
<p>UVMask’s UV-C LEDs produce a very narrow spectrum of UV-C light, unlike the sunlight that reaches the Earth. We also use a nano-coating optical filter to filter out any potential ozone generating wavelengths.</p>
<p>All the UV-C light is sealed within the Sterile-Vortex, which means there is no UV-C leakage during the filtration process, and it will never reach your skin.</p>
<div> </div>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/465282871?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div>
<div> </div>
<p>Although some types of UV light are capable of generating ozone (O3), a gas that naturally exists in the upper atmosphere, only UV wavelengths of 185 nm or shorter can generate ozone (source).</p>
<p>UVMask uses 275nm wavelength UV-C LEDs, which reliably generate a very pure and narrow range of UV-C that does not go shorter than 255nm. </p>
<p>UV-C at this narrow pure range has been empirically tested to be incapable of generating ozone. Each UVMask is factory-tested for its UV-C wavelength purity to ensure its high safety standard.</p>
<h3>Leak-Proof and Lab-Certified<br/> </h3>
<p>UVMask uses a first-of-its-kind consumer-grade UV-C light. This form of LED tech has never seen practical implementation in face mask purification.</p>
<p>The light intensities and time required have been too impractical to purify effectively at the speed we breathe. </p>
<p>Until now. </p>
<h3>
<br/>Better Daily Protection</h3> <p>UVMask is intended for non-medical consumer use for general protection against air pollution only. It is not intended to be used for medical purposes include any uses related to COVID-19.</p>

<h3>State-of-the-Art UVC LEDs</h3>

It is intended for non-medical consumer use for general protection against air pollution only. It is not intended to be used for medical purposes such as uses related to COVID-19. We do not make any anti-viral or anti-bacterial claims.Indiegogo is a crowdfunding platform, not an online store. By backing this project, you are not purchasing a market-ready product, but investing in an innovative idea that will use the funds raised to develop product prototypes and acquire necessary regulatory approvals. Thank you for supporting the development of UVMask: a New Kind of Wearable Personal Face ProtectionUVMask is the next-generation reusable air purification face protection that's currently being developed to meet future demands. It is designed to provide up to 8-hours of daily protection.

 
Ground-Breaking Safety Design & Tech
UVMask has been designed from the ground up to help provide better daily protection, provide a comfortable wearing experience, not get in the way of conversation and effectively circulate the air you breathe away from your face. UVMask In The Media


Change the filters weekly if you wear it consistently over the course of a week and daily if you are using it for multiple hours every day.  

 
 
Lab Tested Safe & Ozone-Free (Video Proof)
UVMask’s UV-C LEDs produce a very narrow spectrum of UV-C light, unlike the sunlight that reaches the Earth. We also use a nano-coating optical filter to filter out any potential ozone generating wavelengths.
All the UV-C light is sealed within the Sterile-Vortex, which means there is no UV-C leakage during the filtration process, and it will never reach your skin.
 

 
Although some types of UV light are capable of generating ozone (O3), a gas that naturally exists in the upper atmosphere, only UV wavelengths of 185 nm or shorter can generate ozone (source).
UVMask uses 275nm wavelength UV-C LEDs, which reliably generate a very pure and narrow range of UV-C that does not go shorter than 255nm. 
UV-C at this narrow pure range has been empirically tested to be incapable of generating ozone. Each UVMask is factory-tested for its UV-C wavelength purity to ensure its high safety standard.
Leak-Proof and Lab-Certified 
UVMask uses a first-of-its-kind consumer-grade UV-C light. This form of LED tech has never seen practical implementation in face mask purification.
The light intensities and time required have been too impractical to purify effectively at the speed we breathe. 
Until now. 

Better Daily Protection UVMask is intended for non-medical consumer use for general protection against air pollution only. It is not intended to be used for medical purposes include any uses related to COVID-19.
 
 

 
 
 
How-To Videos
 

 
 
Multiple Protections
All air is passed through 2 high-efficiency layers of protection:

The first is a passive Air Filter. The advanced filtration system blocks small particles, such as dust, smoke, pollen, smoke, pollutants, and particles up to 100x smaller than a grain of flour!
The second layer is the patent-pending Sterile Vortex, an air-purifying component powered by UV LEDs.

 
State-of-the-Art UVC LEDs
UVMask’s 2x UV-C LEDs provide some of the highest UV energy output on the market. Built into the Sterile Vortex, the UV-C light shines from a distance 10x closer than in other typical uses.

 
Positive Airflow
UVMask is equipped with a high-speed turbine fan, bringing clean fresh air into the mask with every breath.

Zeus Wallet is free of any type of mechanism subject to wear and thanks to its innovative magnetic closure, this wallet is guaranteed for life!If you are wondering how many cards you can bring with your Zeus Wallet, please keep in mind that you are the one who decides. In fact, thanks to its modular system, your Zeus Wallet can have as many layers as you wish, thus adapting its thickness according to your needs.For example, if you go out for a jog, you can even bring a single layer and minimize the thickness of your Zeus Wallet.If, on the other hand, you have to face a long journey, you can add more layers in order to have extra credit cards with you. 


Card Demagnetized Test

We know that in the past other manufacturers have tried to make a magnetic wallet but Customers had the unpleasant surprise of finding all the credit cards demagnetized.
 

 
Zeus Wallet is designed to be safe for magnetic stripe technology. As you can see, we have positioned the magnets inside a particular casing, which makes them safe, and, above all, invisible!
 


 
Every day we are forced to carry many objects...smartphones, keys, laptops, earphones and it is easy to lose something.
The chances of losing Zeus Wallet are practically impossible. It has a special layer with an active tracker tag that will synchronize with your smartphone to protect you from any theft or accidental loss. 
 

 



 

 
Thanks to the light and sound signal, you can easily find your Zeus Wallet when you leave it out of its place. Just activate the search function from your Smartphone and you will find it in a few moments.
 

 
 Thanks to the easy free app available for IOS or Android, you can configure all the alarms you want in order to be notified every time you move away from your Zeus wallet.   You can receive automatic alerts when you move away from Zeus Wallet. Any distance between (2-8 m) can be specified for automatic alerts.  You do not have to worry if you do not remember the place where you left your Zeus wallet.The smartphone automatically records its last position and will provide you with the information needed to start looking for it.   If you forgot your phone somewhere, it will be easy to find it. Simply press the button embedded in the layer tag to immediately ring your phone. Zeus immune to all RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) attacks.Zeus Wallet is made of a particular Aluminum (Aluminum 606 T6) which offers RFID-skimming protection by blocking 100% of the signals.Even the most modern thieves will not be able to steal your personal data anymore and you can finally walk without worrying about someone reading your data.  However, if you want even more space and you also want to carry keys, coins, SD cards, or your business cards, you cannot miss the innovative sliding box layer, practical, thin but still very roomy. Thanks to the money clip, you can store banknotes in the lower part of your Zeus Wallet without increasing its thickness  You will be able to easily identify and grab the card you need and then put it back in the order you preferEach single layer can store a maximum of two credit cards Only adds 0.3mm / 0.01in to the total thickness  It is very easy to store cards in your Zeus Wallet and you will not have to worry about dropping them.

The result is a light, comfortable, safe, and cool product. The prototype not only respected all the aesthetic parts but thanks to your feedback on the measurements, we were also able to introduce an innovation in the ergonomic part to adapt the mask to the face of each, maintaining a very high level of protection. At the same time, we improved the breathability thanks to the increased surface of the filters. All these are fundamental features for normal daily use of the CLIU mask.
We worked also on the band’s design, reducing the bulk behind the head and further improving the easy fit.

<p>Timepieces With Soul !</p>
<p>We get our inspiration for this new range, as with our first range, from the classic instrument panels of the WORLD FAMOUS Douglas DC-3 aeroplane, made famous over the last 80 years, and in films such as ""Raiders of the lost Arc"" and flown by James Bond in the film ""Quantum of Solace"" !</p> <p>This time round we are using the renowned Swiss Ronda movement coupled with the British vintage design, and again  (for the last time) are using the material from an original DC-3 aeroplane to make the metal tags which you see on the dial.</p> <p>So again for watch enthusiasts &amp; aviation lovers we are giving people the opportunity to wear a piece of history. Each watch will be made with a metal tag in the 6 hour position made from the wing of a 1940's DC-3, with the plane identification number NC - 16007 engraved onto the tag itself !</p> <p>This is the last offering for a DC-3 inspired watch, no more models are going to be made, so this is the last chance to grab a piece of the history !</p> <p>WEAR THE HISTORY</p>
<p>We feel that it is nice to be wearing a piece of history and hope you can support us in bring this project to life, as there will be more classic designs and even more utilising of classic 1930's - 1940's vintage aircraft in our timepieces !</p>

<p> Our story so far </p>
<p>First of all we would like to say ""thank you"" very much indeed"" to all our backers who in 2020 supported us on the launch of our first range. It really was a tough year for us all, with most of us feeling the restrictions of this terrible pandemic, so thank you all so much for backing us!</p>
<p>With the kind support of our  original backers on our first campaign, we really got off to a flying start,(pardon the pun) and launched in 2020.  We managed to get the first range out as planned at the end of November 2020, although it was a bit of a challenge at times with Covid19 in full swing ,which did affect the supply of the movement and delivery,  however we are glad to say that we managed to keep things on schedule.</p>
<p>So now we offer this exciting new model, the DC-3 Mk ll </p> <p>Classic styling, with a generous 42mm case, SWISS MADE movement, all stainless steel case , sapphire glass, and comes with both a vintage Italian leather strap &amp; a vintage canvas strap !</p>

<p>We put our heart and soul into the design and creation of our watches, and spend a lot of time in the whole process, so that the STROND brand will go from strength to strength, making our brand stand out !  </p>
<p>Firstly the concept drawings for the new STROND range were made.</p>

<p><strong>So much to say just on the dial !</strong></p>
<p>We designed the dial so that no only is it in keeping with vintage 1940's styling, but the 2 sub-dials are very reminiscent of 1940's altitude metres.</p>
<p>Sub-dials</p>
<p>OK, so lets look at the 2 sub-dials.  The function of the top &amp; bottom dials are used as a stop watch.</p>
<p>The top Dial........When used as a stop watch, the top dial acts as a 30min counter and a 12 hour counter.  So the top dial has 2 hands, the larger hand tracks the minutes (30m) and the smaller hand keeps count of the hours (12h) </p>
<p>The bottom sub-dial tracks seconds </p>
<p>So you can use the watch as a stop watch, with lapping function.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">CAD image used to show the sub-dial</p>

<p><strong>The Case back..... </strong></p>
<p>So for the case back. We have engraved an image of one of the DC-3 engines and propellers onto the case back. This is a nice individual touch and gives a unique feel to your new timepiece. Around the outer rim of the case back is where you will find engraved your serial number as well as other details such as Swiss movement, sapphire glass ect......</p> <p>We chose a brushed  316 grade stainless steel case and case back for the DC3 Mkll as this is in keeping with the STROND brand, and when done right gives a really nice sheen to the watch.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Each strap will have the numbering  DC-3 and the STROND logo embossed onto the strap . Please keep in mind that each strap is cut from 1940's ammo bags, and no 2 pieces will be the same and, so may vary in shade (from reddish brown to dark chocolate brown)  and in texture from strap to strap, and have the markings which the bag may have picked up over time , however, we feel that's whats adds nostalgia to the strap !</p>
<p>Each strap will come with quick release spring bars and a roller buckle.</p>

<p>One of the longest-used airliners ever, the Douglas DC-3 nears 80 years in the air as an aviation icon.</p>
<p>​The Douglas DC-3 is universally recognised as the greatest airplane of its time, some would argue that it is the greatest of all time……..</p>
<p>The Douglas Aircraft Company built the ""Douglas Commercial 3"" and was based on the 1933/34 Douglas DC-1 and DC-2.  Design work began in 1934 and he DC-3 debuted in the mid-1930's as an aviation rock star.</p>
<p>THE FIRST FLIGHT December 17, 1935, was a sunny but cool afternoon in Santa Monica, California. The holidays were coming and spirits were high in the Douglas Aircraft Company. It was another ordinary day at Clover Field, a big polished propeller caught the sun’s light as it began to turn.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1617819732/gwuooyv5lscnff2jjvyu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Slowly it revolved and then a belch of blue-white smoke appeared. The engine roared into life, and the propeller was lost in its own motion. A second propeller came to life. For a few minutes, the engines roared and then the plane began to move forward.</p> <p>With its two powerful propeller engines it revolutionised the travel industry by cutting typical coast-to-coast flight time across the United States from 25 hours to just 18.</p> <p>​Pilots, both military and civilian, loved the DC-3. It took off easily, cruised comfortably at 185 mph at 10,000 feet, and had a ceiling of 23,200 feet and a low stalling speed (67 mph). Pilots said it landed itself, and it had a cruising range of 1,500–2,100 miles.</p> <p>When production of the DC-3 ended in 1945, more than 13,000 of them had been built. The DC-3’s ease of handling and maintenance, its facility at taking off and landing on short runways, and its remarkable reliability combined to keep it flying in many regions of the world into the 21st century.</p>

<p>Watch designer Terrence Ray has been designing timepieces for a number of years and has worked in joint collaborations and designs with a number of watchmakers. Terrence was the designer for the Aston Martin tourbillon, designed as timepiece to celebrate the release of the new Aston Martin Valkyrie super car and presented to the design director of Aston Martin himself at their headquarters in Gaydon, Warwickshire.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1617820713/ue8si3gowr7kah4d6sfi.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Passionate about watches, Terrence Ray from a very early age had a keen interest in timepieces and at the age of just ten travelled half way across London on his own, taking 2 bus rides in order to purchase his first timepiece, and form that moment on Terrence became a bit of a collector of unique timepieces. So it goes without saying that Terrence later on in life became interested in Horology and subsequently gravitated towards designing watches himself.</p>
<p>Terrence Ray has now launched the new vintage STROND brand, with the release of the eagerly anticipated DC-3 Series.</p>

</div></div>","Introducing the stunning DC-3 Mk ll from watch designer Terrence Ray  
        
 After the successful launch of the STROND DC-3 mark 1,  we are going to be launching right here on Indiegogo the much anticipated vintage DC-3 Mkll  pilots watch.

Limited Edition with Swiss movement......limited to only 1930 pieces 
 


Timepieces With Soul !
We get our inspiration for this new range, as with our first range, from the classic instrument panels of the WORLD FAMOUS Douglas DC-3 aeroplane, made famous over the last 80 years, and in films such as ""Raiders of the lost Arc"" and flown by James Bond in the film ""Quantum of Solace"" ! This time round we are using the renowned Swiss Ronda movement coupled with the British vintage design, and again  (for the last time) are using the material from an original DC-3 aeroplane to make the metal tags which you see on the dial. So again for watch enthusiasts & aviation lovers we are giving people the opportunity to wear a piece of history. Each watch will be made with a metal tag in the 6 hour position made from the wing of a 1940's DC-3, with the plane identification number NC - 16007 engraved onto the tag itself ! This is the last offering for a DC-3 inspired watch, no more models are going to be made, so this is the last chance to grab a piece of the history ! WEAR THE HISTORY
We feel that it is nice to be wearing a piece of history and hope you can support us in bring this project to life, as there will be more classic designs and even more utilising of classic 1930's - 1940's vintage aircraft in our timepieces !

 Our story so far 
First of all we would like to say ""thank you"" very much indeed"" to all our backers who in 2020 supported us on the launch of our first range. It really was a tough year for us all, with most of us feeling the restrictions of this terrible pandemic, so thank you all so much for backing us!
With the kind support of our  original backers on our first campaign, we really got off to a flying start,(pardon the pun) and launched in 2020.  We managed to get the first range out as planned at the end of November 2020, although it was a bit of a challenge at times with Covid19 in full swing ,which did affect the supply of the movement and delivery,  however we are glad to say that we managed to keep things on schedule.
So now we offer this exciting new model, the DC-3 Mk ll  Classic styling, with a generous 42mm case, SWISS MADE movement, all stainless steel case , sapphire glass, and comes with both a vintage Italian leather strap & a vintage canvas strap !

The movement we are using in this timepiece is the gold plated Swiss made Ronda movement. 
 Swiss made gold plated  movement
 Power saving mechanism with pulled out stem: Reduction of consumption approximately 70%

 

We put our heart and soul into the design and creation of our watches, and spend a lot of time in the whole process, so that the STROND brand will go from strength to strength, making our brand stand out !  
Firstly the concept drawings for the new STROND range were made.
 

Then we move onto the detailed technical drawings 

Next we had the 2D CAD images made up
 

 
 The above images are CAD images and were used in conjunction with the technical drawing to make the  prototypes. Shown for demonstration purposes !
The end result 

The all black & bronze model


So much to say just on the dial !
We designed the dial so that no only is it in keeping with vintage 1940's styling, but the 2 sub-dials are very reminiscent of 1940's altitude metres.
Sub-dials
OK, so lets look at the 2 sub-dials.  The function of the top & bottom dials are used as a stop watch.
The top Dial........When used as a stop watch, the top dial acts as a 30min counter and a 12 hour counter.  So the top dial has 2 hands, the larger hand tracks the minutes (30m) and the smaller hand keeps count of the hours (12h) 
The bottom sub-dial tracks seconds 
So you can use the watch as a stop watch, with lapping function.

CAD image used to show the sub-dial
 
And not forgetting that the metal dial tag in the 6 hour position is made from the wing of a 1940's DC-3, with the plane identification number NC - 16007 engraved onto the tag itself !

Wing material is taken from an iconic 1940's Douglas DC3


Stainless steel and bronze option

The all black stainless steel and bronze .......She's a real Beaut !

 Comes with a handmade calfskin black leather strap, and a Khaki green cotton canvas strap


 
The all 316 grade stainless steel version......keeping it classic!

 Comes with a handmade calfskin olive green leather strap, and a Khaki green cotton canvas strap, it looks the part !


 
The all 316 grade stainless steel & bronze version  

 
Comes with a handmade calfskin, chestnut red leather strap, and a Khaki green cotton canvas strap........vintage and classy at the same time!


 
The all black model option .........dark and moody !

 The all black model shown with the canvas strap in the above picture 



 
The Case back..... 
So for the case back. We have engraved an image of one of the DC-3 engines and propellers onto the case back. This is a nice individual touch and gives a unique feel to your new timepiece. Around the outer rim of the case back is where you will find engraved your serial number as well as other details such as Swiss movement, sapphire glass ect...... We chose a brushed  316 grade stainless steel case and case back for the DC3 Mkll as this is in keeping with the STROND brand, and when done right gives a really nice sheen to the watch.

 
 


 
Your new STROND timepiece comes with 2 lovely vintage watch straps
 One ......Vintage Leather Strap 
A vintage calfskin handmade leather strap with:
Quick release spring bars
High quality roller style buckle 
All our straps are hand made, oil tanned vintage style leather straps, with neat x2 stitching 

 
Cotton Canvas Strap 
STRAP two: 
Quick release spring bars
High quality roller style buckle
This is a really nice looking cotton canvas strap, with a roller buckle and quick release spring bars for easy removal of the strap. Most canvas straps are nylon made, but we chose cotton canvas, which is in keeping with the era !

 
With cotton canvas strap
 
NEW UPGRADE STRAP
Boy do we an amazing 1940's vintage leather strap for those who take advantage of this upgrade .  A one off bespoke leather strap made from original aged 1940's Swiss ammo bags, made by English master craftsman Peter Robson.  Each piece is 100% hand made by Peter from original 1940's leather ammo bags. As you can see from the photo below, they really are amazing and will set your watch apart form others !
 

Hand made strap, made from 1940's Swiss ammo bags by master leather craftsmen !
 
NOTE: Each strap will have the numbering  DC-3 and the STROND logo embossed onto the strap . Please keep in mind that each strap is cut from 1940's ammo bags, and no 2 pieces will be the same and, so may vary in shade (from reddish brown to dark chocolate brown)  and in texture from strap to strap, and have the markings which the bag may have picked up over time , however, we feel that's whats adds nostalgia to the strap !
Each strap will come with quick release spring bars and a roller buckle.

One of the longest-used airliners ever, the Douglas DC-3 nears 80 years in the air as an aviation icon.
​The Douglas DC-3 is universally recognised as the greatest airplane of its time, some would argue that it is the greatest of all time……..
The Douglas Aircraft Company built the ""Douglas Commercial 3"" and was based on the 1933/34 Douglas DC-1 and DC-2.  Design work began in 1934 and he DC-3 debuted in the mid-1930's as an aviation rock star.
THE FIRST FLIGHT December 17, 1935, was a sunny but cool afternoon in Santa Monica, California. The holidays were coming and spirits were high in the Douglas Aircraft Company. It was another ordinary day at Clover Field, a big polished propeller caught the sun’s light as it began to turn.

Slowly it revolved and then a belch of blue-white smoke appeared. The engine roared into life, and the propeller was lost in its own motion. A second propeller came to life. For a few minutes, the engines roared and then the plane began to move forward. With its two powerful propeller engines it revolutionised the travel industry by cutting typical coast-to-coast flight time across the United States from 25 hours to just 18. ​Pilots, both military and civilian, loved the DC-3. It took off easily, cruised comfortably at 185 mph at 10,000 feet, and had a ceiling of 23,200 feet and a low stalling speed (67 mph). Pilots said it landed itself, and it had a cruising range of 1,500–2,100 miles. When production of the DC-3 ended in 1945, more than 13,000 of them had been built. The DC-3’s ease of handling and maintenance, its facility at taking off and landing on short runways, and its remarkable reliability combined to keep it flying in many regions of the world into the 21st century.
 

James Bond 007 
James Bond flies the Gooney Bird (DC-3) in 2008.  A Gooney Bird helped James Bond get out of a jam........Fans of the Bond film ""Quantum of Solace,"" may recall actor Daniel Craig in the cockpit of a beat-up DC-3 fighting off a Marchetti plane......see the video clip below.
https://youtu.be/NZqbvJ-IBx8 Indiana Jones flies the DC-3
Back in the 1980s, a DC-3 served another movie franchise hero, in ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,"" Indy flies from New York to Newfoundland to the Azores and Europe on his quest for the Holy Grail.

Watch designer Terrence Ray has been designing timepieces for a number of years and has worked in joint collaborations and designs with a number of watchmakers. Terrence was the designer for the Aston Martin tourbillon, designed as timepiece to celebrate the release of the new Aston Martin Valkyrie super car and presented to the design director of Aston Martin himself at their headquarters in Gaydon, Warwickshire.

Passionate about watches, Terrence Ray from a very early age had a keen interest in timepieces and at the age of just ten travelled half way across London on his own, taking 2 bus rides in order to purchase his first timepiece, and form that moment on Terrence became a bit of a collector of unique timepieces. So it goes without saying that Terrence later on in life became interested in Horology and subsequently gravitated towards designing watches himself.
Terrence Ray has now launched the new vintage STROND brand, with the release of the eagerly anticipated DC-3 Series.

For supporting us in bringing our brand to life ALL BACKERS will become ""founder members"" of STROND and will gain access into the departure lounge on our website which will give you access to all future releases at a good discount price, as well as a ""heads-up"" on new designs and the launch of any new models !",65.0,0,"2 Campaigns

Volterman has a built-in Powerbank, Distance Alarm System, Worldwide GPS Tracking, Thief Detection Camera and Global WiFi hotspot. 
 
 
 

Built-in Powerbank fully charges your smartphone on the go. Works both wirelessly and with a cable. Extremely lightweight and thin. 
  Bluetooth Alarm System doesn’t only notify you every time you leave your wallet behind, it sends alarm signals when you leave your phone behind as well!  Wi-Fi Hotspot ensures you have internet, wherever you travel. The internet cost with Volterman is up to 3 times cheaper than regular roaming charges. Global GPS system secures you from thieves and loss. From Australia to Alaska, track your wallet wherever you are in real-time. There’s a tiny camera in Volterman. Once your wallet is in lost mode, Volterman's camera pictures anyone who opens it and sends you the pics.        Slim, sexy and super powerful, it fits neatly into any pocket.  Elegant and extremely lightweight with enough room to store all your cards and cash. From passport to the boarding pass, take everything with you.   
   Yes, you need them all for 365 days a year     You can store your files from your phone into the wallet with just a tap of a button in your mobile app.    PCB in all Volterman wallets is fully sealed with epoxide resin sealant which makes it secure and resistant to heavy weights and heating.We've tested Volterman wallets every way we know over the last two years — from carting them around constantly to driving over them. They're built to last! All Volterman wallets are RFID Protected against data theft. All Volterman wallets are waterproof. Only 0.43 Inch (11 mm) thickness and weighs only 0.26 lb (120g) We’ve spent countless hours working with world-class engineers to develop the very best technology and functionality in Volterman wallets.We use only high-quality technical equipment to ensure long lasting functionality and durability. Volterman wallets will have one year guarantee against technical defects and functionality. Inside:     Room for 8 cards, but you can fit 10+ cards in your Volterman Bifold. To ensure a superior quality standard of your Volterman, we partnered with some of the world’s leading manufacturers of leather products, who produce for the world’s premium fashion brands, such as Cartier, Dunhill and Louis Vuitton etc.When you have it in your hands, you will immediately feel the premium quality and our passion for perfection.Volterman wallets are made from genuine Nappa leather and superior quality Vegan (Faux) leather. You will decide the material later on in a survey. No need to remember to charge your wallet every time you go out. Simply charge it wirelessly on the go with Volterman Wireless Charger . Control your wallet on the go with Volterman apps for iOS and Android.     Having lost his wallet several times, Azat (our engineering ninja) started to think about developing an easy way to find it. He felt the need even more when his 3-year old daughter hid the wallet behind the stove. He thought that it was lost, and spent more than a month getting the documents inside reissued! He started to search the market of wallets, but all the wallets had only a Bluetooth tracking within 20 meters.This remains the case today.All this led to creating the world's most powerful wallet, named Volterman, with revolutionary features and stunning design. Our team of experienced software and hardware engineers have spent many sleepless nights and have been working on the project for more than two years from now to come up with the final fully functional prototype —  ready for a mass production. The design of Volterman Wallets is created by the award-winning Backbone Branding creative design studio

<h3><b>Background:</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>As a person who is always on the go, I always try to look for convenient products that will make my life easier. Like many, using my phone and my tablet is an essential for the job that i have. I always, always end up needing to charge my devices at the middle of the day, and guess what? I don't always have a charger with me. I've noticed that this happens to lots of people and lacks their days. This is how the idea of <b>T E G S</b> bag came to me. </p>
<p></p>
<b><h3>Description:</h3></b><p><b>T E G S</b> bag
is new unique invention that serves those who want to combine, convenience, chic and technology at once. With this smart bag that has a built-in power bank, carrier has the opportunity to charge two mobile devices at the same time. In
addition to that, mobile devices can be charged from outside the bag, through a
snap opening, and/or inside the bag. </p>
<p>          The power bank that we are
willing to use in each bag has Aluminum cover which has an unheated property
for safety purposes. It has two power outlets, one inside the bag, and the
other can be found in the <b>“Side Snap Opening” ( See Figure 1) </b>. Both outlets can be used at the same time for different mobile
devices. The<b> “Frontal Snap Opening” (
See Figure 1)</b> shows the power
level of the power bank and a Power Inlet to charge the power bank itself. The

As a person who is always on the go, I always try to look for convenient products that will make my life easier. Like many, using my phone and my tablet is an essential for the job that i have. I always, always end up needing to charge my devices at the middle of the day, and guess what? I don't always have a charger with me. I've noticed that this happens to lots of people and lacks their days. This is how the idea of T E G S bag came to me. 

Description:T E G S bag
is new unique invention that serves those who want to combine, convenience, chic and technology at once. With this smart bag that has a built-in power bank, carrier has the opportunity to charge two mobile devices at the same time. In
addition to that, mobile devices can be charged from outside the bag, through a
snap opening, and/or inside the bag. 
          The power bank that we are
willing to use in each bag has Aluminum cover which has an unheated property
for safety purposes. It has two power outlets, one inside the bag, and the
other can be found in the “Side Snap Opening” ( See Figure 1) . Both outlets can be used at the same time for different mobile
devices. The “Frontal Snap Opening” (
See Figure 1) shows the power
level of the power bank and a Power Inlet to charge the power bank itself. The
process is shown in the video.

Figure 1: Frontal and Side Snap Openings
Figure 2 below shows how to charge a mobile device through the Side Snap Opening.

Figure 2: Charing Through Side Snap Opening

    


We took deep care in
choosing the leathers used for bag, the velvet material for the inside, and all
the metal wears. Details really matter. Additionally, the bag includes six
leather cardholders in it and a zipper pocket to increase the use out of it.
           After surveying what
individuals need to carry during the day and what are their needs, we came up
with the bag's size. One can fit in all his personal stuff that s/he need
during his/her busy day and even exclude using a separate wallet and benefit
from the existing six card holders ( Figure 4) and
the zipper pocket. The bag is carried though the handle that is shown in Figure 3 below.

T E G S would be a great gift to your beloved ones. So we gave attention to the packaging and presentation. With each T E G S bag, our customer will get a dust bag, and a paper bag. See Figure 5.

bicycle every day, and the number of bicyclist is increasing. It means
that more and more bicycle accidents occur.</span><br/></p>
<p>A collision with an
automobile is the greatest fear most people have about cycling. especially, accident is fatal that occurs in the night-time because of invisibility. Most of cyclists know this hazard, so they usually put a LED lamp on their bike and shining stuff on their body.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> </span></p>
<p><b>However, the accident still happens. Why?</b></p>
<p>We wonder why it is, and finally found out the fundamental cause: <i>There isn't any communication between car driver and bicyclist.</i></p>
<p>Therefore, we invented communication tool, which is LED direction signal that cyclist can control in accordance with where they are going. Once car drivers see the signal, They can decide how to drive. We used 'Bluetooth technology' so that any wire never annoy the cyclist.</p>
<p>It was not enough. We thought that it should be more enjoyable experience so that every body finds it in their heart to have it. We decided to convert this technological tool into fashion. </p>
<p>And i<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">f it's fashion, it should be chic.</span></p>

</div></div>","Millions of people across the globe travel via
bicycle every day, and the number of bicyclist is increasing. It means
that more and more bicycle accidents occur.
A collision with an
automobile is the greatest fear most people have about cycling. especially, accident is fatal that occurs in the night-time because of invisibility. Most of cyclists know this hazard, so they usually put a LED lamp on their bike and shining stuff on their body.
 
However, the accident still happens. Why?
We wonder why it is, and finally found out the fundamental cause: There isn't any communication between car driver and bicyclist.
Therefore, we invented communication tool, which is LED direction signal that cyclist can control in accordance with where they are going. Once car drivers see the signal, They can decide how to drive. We used 'Bluetooth technology' so that any wire never annoy the cyclist.
It was not enough. We thought that it should be more enjoyable experience so that every body finds it in their heart to have it. We decided to convert this technological tool into fashion. 
And if it's fashion, it should be chic.
 So The SEIL (Safe Enjoyable Interactive Light) bag has been born.







Originally developed in 2010, the SEIL bag has been continuously improved over the past 5 years, making it the highest quality product of its kind on the market. Though it has been copied, it is the only such product that has been on the market and in finalized development since 2010.


The SEIL bag Keeps you...



How it works
Direction signals and short messages can be shown via the wireless controller
Using The wireless
controller, you can communicate traffic signals and direction of travel (right,
left) or express a cyclist's mood or feelings. The SEIL-APP can be used to
custom design emotions. Both transmit images to the bag's color LED display.

<h3><b>DiveBack, the first GPS for scuba divers<br/></b></h3>
<p></p>
<p><span>Have you dragged your flippers across several
seas and oceans? Have you also seen wonderful things, and experienced fabulous
moments of emotion and beauty?</span></p>
<p>If so, you are a
diver, like us. And like us, you may have felt completely lost on several
occasions, not knowing where your boat was. Like us, like all divers, you dream
of not having to worry about the navigation of your diving and to freely and
happily explore the seabed.</p>
<br/><h3>Concept<br/>
</h3>
</div><div>
<h3></h3>The idea of creating a GPS
for divers came on the way back from a diving cruise in the Red Sea, when no
one was able to find the boat ! Eduardo and Bertrand decided to design
DiveBack. Bertrand had worked for a company specialized in the construction of
civil and military submarines. The company attached buoys to submarines, which
enabled radio communication when they emerged. They decided to use a SIMILAR
system to provide divers with GPS data/navigation.
</div><div>
<p></p>
<p><b>After conducting research for several
months and carrying out tests in the sea, they designed a prototype. Every time
they used it, DiveBack got them back to the boat; it works !</b></p>
<p>Convenient and
easy to use, you just need to memorize the boat’s GPS position before getting
in the water. Then, simply enjoy your aquatic stroll. At some point, you’ll
want to go back to the boat, and perhaps you won’t know exactly where you are.
No worries in that case! Even if you are 60 feet under the surface, you can
just release the DiveBack antenna-buoy. It will quickly indicate the direction
and distance from your boat. Whatever the configuration and the visibility
conditions, DiveBack will provide you with the most direct route to your boat.</p>
<p><br/>
<span><b></b></span></p>
<h3><b>DiveBack is very useful in case of reduced visibility<br/>
</b></h3>(lots of divers have already experienced that !), because you can
find the boat even if it is invisible under water. DiveBack can also be very
useful for the scientists, who will need to note the GPS address of objects and
studied places, without having to resurface.<p></p>

DiveBack is
a DIVING accessory that is easy to carry, either attached to a carabiner or
slid in the stab pocket (diameter: 3.9 in and thickness: 2.5 in). Its body
consists of a very powerful satellite receiver with an interface made of a
liquid crystal screen and four control buttons. Around this GPS, a drum with a
handle allows the diver to unwind up to 60 feet of cable which connects the
floating antenna to the DiveBack device as you dive. A rotary axis provided
with a grip will allow the simple and fast rolling-up of the cable after its
use. The detachable lid contains the satellite antenna of the GPS. Filled with
air, it contains a reserve that acts as a buoy to unwind the cable and maintain
the antenna on the surface during its use. A rechargeable battery (10 hours of
useful capacity) feeds the GPS. A ring allows divers to fix
DiveBack to any system of attachment.

Tanned using a blend of tannins from chestnut, mimosa and tara tree barks, our leather has a rich fragrance and develops a beautiful patina over time.  In order to ensure optimal reliability, the Soft Briefcase features premium Riri® zips and gold and silver-plated hardware. Riri® is a Swiss brand which makes very high quality metal zips in Italy. Some say it trumps on quality over all other brands like YKK and Ideal.   For lining fabric, we have used a Cordura® brand Nylon Oxford 500D dust and water resistant nylon fabric. Using Nylon provides durability and flexibility without deformation. Cordura® is a well known American brand which manufactures high quality fabrics used in many luxury brands.  Additionally, all handles and structure of the briefcase are made to hold in excess of 22 kg with all stress points double stitched to avoid failure during usage.It's Personalisable:In pursuit of creating a unique user experience for our leather bags, we have integrated customisation unlike any other leather briefcase to suit your individual needs.  Along with choosing leather colour: you may also choose the inlay fabric's colour, gold or silver finish metal hardware as well as the embossed signature. Our soft briefcase features a modular section that allows users to interchange two removable utility modules based on their unique lifestyle requirements. Users may choose between five different module designs with each offering a varied function.   These modules are also detachable and use magnetic buttons for support, which allows them to be carried independently of the briefcase as well.  You may also choose between gold or silver plating for the metal hardware such as loops, buckles, buttons and zips. Our default design is with a silver finish but you may decide which given option reflects your aesthetic sense better. If you would prefer an alternative to the standard Venetian Red colour for the lining fabric, we offer you an option to choose from either Emerald or Smoke.

<h3>It's Time For Hoodies!</h3>
<p>Red Helen has been playing shows and selling merch all over South Africa for many years now but one merch item that we've never been able to do is hoodies! </p>
<p>Many of our fans have asked us: ""Why don't you guys ever get hoodies made?!"" Well, there is one very simple, but very good, reason for this - <strong>having hoodies done is very expensive</strong> - we just don't have the money up front to buy them and have them printed.</p>
<p>With your help, this campaign will solve this problem and we can finally make the fans, as well as the band's, dream come true! </p>
<h3>How to pre-order a hoodie</h3>
<p>Step 1 - Go to the 'Perks' section and claim the perk with the amount of hoodies you want to buy<br/>Step 2 - Select your size/s<br/>Step 3 - Enter your payment details and select shipping options<br/>Step 4 - Get 49 more people to pre-order a hoodie<br/>Step 5 - We get the hoodies printed and delivered to your doorstep</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To keep the costs relatively low, we need to order in bulk. </p>
<p>We need your help to get at least <u>50 people</u> to buy one hoodie or more. The more hoodies you buy, the more perks you get.</p>

This works out to R22 500 for 50 hoodies. With the current exchange rate, it's  about $1750.</p>
<p><i>Please remember NONE of this money goes into our own pockets. Everything we make goes <u>straight back into the band</u> in order to print more merch. We only mark up the prices enough to cover costs and possibly have a few more hoodies made. </i></p>

<p>If we have to order any less than 50 hoodies it'll shoot the pricing right up and it'll become economically unviable, so there would be no point to take your money.</p>
<p><b>What About Shipping?</b><br/>Unfortunately, these prices do NOT include shipping. You can pick it up from a band member's house in Johannesburg or from any of our shows. We also have paid shipping options which you can choose at checkout. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>This campaign is dedicated to those in need. If you're reading this, chances are that you spend more money in groceries or shopping than you do giving to charity. Thus, this company strives to merge the world of fashion and shopping with charity-giving. </p>
<p>As citizens in a global community, it is our privilege to give to charity. Even so, many donations to charity are improperly allocated and progress is minimal. Thus, this campaign revolves around select charities -including the Against Malaria Foundation, Schistosomiasis Control Initiative, and Deworm the World Initative- that have demonstrated outstanding efficacy. Customers will get the unique opportunity to not only purchase domestically-sourced, sustainably-made clothing from Haven, but also donate to charity alongside. Indeed, 50% of all profits from this company are allocated to the most effective charities in the world (this is the largest margin of profits ever allocated by a modern clothing company).</p>
<p>By simply contributing to this campaign here on Indiegogo, you are expressing that you care about charity, you care about impoverished individuals in third-world countries, you care about malnutrition, you care about chronic diseases, you care about water quality, and you believe that our world is only strong when we're united. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Every dollar counts in this $5,000 campaign. With successful funding, our team will be able to launch the company to the web, officially partner with our select charities, outreach to the world about our efforts, domestically and internationally source our products, and hire professionals around the world to expand our coverage. As you donate to this campaign, remember that your donations are essentially, in large part, <i>direct</i> donations to charity. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact of this campaign is far-reaching. We selected the charities based on years of research, as well as data from GiveWell (a nonprofit dedicated to finding outstanding giving opportunities and publishing the full details of their analyses to help donors decide where to give). Here's a brief perspective on the impact of your funding:</p>
<ul>
<li>$5 is enough to fund a bednet for a family in sub-Saharan Africa. Every 60 seconds, on average, a children dies from malaria. One bednet is enough to save multiple lives.</li>
<li>$0.50 is enough to deworm a children of parasitic worms. There are currently around 900 million children at risk of parasitic worms worldwide. </li>
<li>$0.30-0.40 is enough to treat schistosomiasis, which affects over 200 millions individuals worldwide.</li>
</ul>
<p>Think about these costs, how minimal they really are, and then think about how many lives we can save together here at Haven. This is not just a clothing company --this is a lifestyle that we should all adopt.</p>

This campaign is dedicated to those in need. If you're reading this, chances are that you spend more money in groceries or shopping than you do giving to charity. Thus, this company strives to merge the world of fashion and shopping with charity-giving. 
As citizens in a global community, it is our privilege to give to charity. Even so, many donations to charity are improperly allocated and progress is minimal. Thus, this campaign revolves around select charities -including the Against Malaria Foundation, Schistosomiasis Control Initiative, and Deworm the World Initative- that have demonstrated outstanding efficacy. Customers will get the unique opportunity to not only purchase domestically-sourced, sustainably-made clothing from Haven, but also donate to charity alongside. Indeed, 50% of all profits from this company are allocated to the most effective charities in the world (this is the largest margin of profits ever allocated by a modern clothing company).
By simply contributing to this campaign here on Indiegogo, you are expressing that you care about charity, you care about impoverished individuals in third-world countries, you care about malnutrition, you care about chronic diseases, you care about water quality, and you believe that our world is only strong when we're united. 

What We Need & What You Get
Every dollar counts in this $5,000 campaign. With successful funding, our team will be able to launch the company to the web, officially partner with our select charities, outreach to the world about our efforts, domestically and internationally source our products, and hire professionals around the world to expand our coverage. As you donate to this campaign, remember that your donations are essentially, in large part, direct donations to charity. 

The Impact
The impact of this campaign is far-reaching. We selected the charities based on years of research, as well as data from GiveWell (a nonprofit dedicated to finding outstanding giving opportunities and publishing the full details of their analyses to help donors decide where to give). Here's a brief perspective on the impact of your funding:

$5 is enough to fund a bednet for a family in sub-Saharan Africa. Every 60 seconds, on average, a children dies from malaria. One bednet is enough to save multiple lives.
$0.50 is enough to deworm a children of parasitic worms. There are currently around 900 million children at risk of parasitic worms worldwide. 
$0.30-0.40 is enough to treat schistosomiasis, which affects over 200 millions individuals worldwide.

Think about these costs, how minimal they really are, and then think about how many lives we can save together here at Haven. This is not just a clothing company --this is a lifestyle that we should all adopt.

Challenges
The main challenge is to receive funding. We want to bring you high-quality, sustainably-sourced products and we want to save the world. To do this, we humbly ask for your donations.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Agatas Katkus, I was born in Lithuania and my family immigrated to Colorado when I was about 5. From the moment I could, I was always creating and building things. I have always had visions in my head for what something should look like and the idea for infinity bandz came to me when I broke my cheap pair of sunglasses. I found a rubber band in my car and wrapped it around the top of my lens in the shape of an infinity symbol and it held them together.</p>
<p>During my first 2 years of college, I wrote a business plan and dialed in what I wanted the product to be. Then proceeded to learn how to 3d model and print. I then learned how to cast and mold using silicon. After experimenting with models and silicon materials I finally got something that wrapped around and looked half decent. My issue is that in order to get the product to its final form I need help from a prototype company that knows way more than I could even imagine.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am asking for fifty thousand dollars and all the funding I'm asking for will go to getting a perfect final product made with the ability to be mass-produced. The bulk of the money will go towards making a mold for mass production.</p>
<p>Once the final infinity band form is reached. The customization portion will be easy to adapt with different colors and lettering.</p>
<p>Even if the full amount isn't reached every cent will go into getting a final product made.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest hurdle that I can foresee is that this is something completely different. People will have to understand what it is and how to use it. </p>
<p>Once it's out in the world and people understand it. I truly believe people will seek them out as they are different and a whole new type of fashion accessory.</p>

<h3>Prosthetic Skinz</h3>
<p>Using 3D printing technology i would like funding to help purchase a printer so that i can begin supplying cosmetic covers to people that have had amputations and sometimes feel that showing the prosthetic limb by wearing shorts, skirts or t shirts can make them feel even more uncomfortable. In more cases children will benefit from this. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What i need</h3>
<p>100% of the funds will go towards buying the 3d printer and materials needed to start printing covers.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>From my own personal experience i know how much of a difference mentally it helped me by being able to wear shorts in the summer and not be ashamed to show off my prosthesis once i had a cover on it.</p>
<p>Anybody who finds themselves feeling at a low point after an amputation would soon feel a little happier knowing that they can at least design a part of their prostheses. And, would not feel like they have to just take what they are given.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<li align=""left"">
<strong>12 Animal Tattoo Stickers</strong><br/>The origin of this concept takes place with the Chinese Zodiac Signs. We made a lot of different sketches in order to find the perfect one to use as tattoos. Finally, we managed to express these animals in a truly Korean Folk style which are well suited for tattoos. There is also a special font and emoticons that allow you to create your special message! They also are designed in the folk style. You can use them for any kind of occasions and with everyone!<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529032228/ppsdyxqefulecrmbvlxx.jpg"" src=""""/><br/> </li>

<strong>Pick Tattoo For Tattoo Simulation,  App </strong><br/>For this product, we launched “Pick Tattoo” app on App Store several month ago. It was developed for simulating this tattoo sticker with phone camera. So it is free. Besides, after simulating, you can buy it on this app.<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529032498/zznxkglufmyukywy1pft.jpg"" src=""""/>
</li>
<li align=""left"">The reason of creating this campaign is because we wish that we can keep trying to develop our app service further more. Our team is now focusing on developing “DEIGN ON DEMAND” platform service to make this app go further. It could be a sort of the platform to share ideas each other, based on “ON DMAND”. So we now guess it might be needed about over 100K $ and 6 month to achieve our goal.<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529033781/pl85hsuyj6sifletvm1o.jpg"" src=""""/>

12 Animal Tattoo StickersThe origin of this concept takes place with the Chinese Zodiac Signs. We made a lot of different sketches in order to find the perfect one to use as tattoos. Finally, we managed to express these animals in a truly Korean Folk style which are well suited for tattoos. There is also a special font and emoticons that allow you to create your special message! They also are designed in the folk style. You can use them for any kind of occasions and with everyone! 

Pick Tattoo For Tattoo Simulation,  App For this product, we launched “Pick Tattoo” app on App Store several month ago. It was developed for simulating this tattoo sticker with phone camera. So it is free. Besides, after simulating, you can buy it on this app.

The reason of creating this campaign is because we wish that we can keep trying to develop our app service further more. Our team is now focusing on developing “DEIGN ON DEMAND” platform service to make this app go further. It could be a sort of the platform to share ideas each other, based on “ON DMAND”. So we now guess it might be needed about over 100K $ and 6 month to achieve our goal.

1000$?  Yeah, we know our fund-raising goal(1000$) is so small and not enough but we want to see and get some confidence from your supports. And we want to see you’re using our products. So we think 1000$ is just meaning “START” of our business’s good signal.

And, of course, they also get to know the time in a playful way. </p><h3>Telephoning made easy</h3><p>You define the contacts (in the app) that your child can call and also those that can call your child. Your child can select the desired person from the contacts (with picture or symbol) and <strong>call them by simply touching them</strong>. If the person they want to reach is not available, your child can send a voice message. </p><p>In an emergency, your child can also reach you (and up to 3 other people) immediately by pressing the <strong>SOS button</strong> for 4 seconds.</p><p>In addition to <strong>excellent voice quality</strong>, the watch also has a front camera so you can not only hear but also see your child. Of course, your child can also see you on the phone and <strong>all communication is encrypted</strong> to protect you and your child.</p><h3>Capturing and sharing moments</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556630654/yexwvohnrw8wfabhy1gt.png"" src=""""/></p><p>How many times have you taken a picture of a beautiful moment in your life and shared it with friends and family? Your child now has this opportunity too (when you activate it). Your child can now <strong>take photos and videos</strong> and share them with family and friends. </p><h3>More exercise playfully</h3><p>Your children will be <strong>rewarded for exercise</strong> (steps and/or calories) with points, which in return open up new playing possibilities. As parents, for example, you can offer your kids a reward system in which you may read two bedtime stories instead of one, or allow them to watch a episode of their favourite series when they reach a certain score. </p><h3>Tasks and scheduling</h3><p>With the app on the smartphone, parents create a <strong>visual schedule</strong> for their children. Light vibrations and icon pop-ups draw the children's attention to their memories. The look is <strong>designed for children between the ages of 4 and 10,</strong> with the clock displaying the time and associated icons that children use to perform specific tasks or functions.</p><h3>Individual and adaptable</h3><p>In addition to customizing background images and entire themes, you can <strong>replace the silicone wristband</strong>, which also protects the watch and is equipped with an <strong>NFC chip</strong>, at any time without tools. This makes the watch even more flexible and it can also be worn as a necklace or attached to clothing with a clip as well.</p><h2>You are in control</h2><p>The development of a child progresses rapidly and there is always something new to discover. In order not to disturb this development, <strong>access to the digital world should not be too early and certainly not unattended</strong>. </p><p>Nevertheless, the digital world offers many possibilities to make life easier for families and especially for living together. In order to solve this balancing act, we have invested a lot of time and effort in the development of the app and software to leave you in control, while not leaving you alone with tons of functions. </p><p>With nemCall, your children can call you freely, but they have <strong>no possibility to play uncontrolled mobile games or access content from the Internet.</strong></p><h3>The nemCall-Watch adapts to your wishes</h3><p>Of course, you can determine who can be called from the nemCall-Watch or who can call your child's nemCall-Watch. Via the admin app you also have the possibility to <strong>activate or deactivate functions of the watch</strong>, depending on which of the functions you consider useful for your child. </p><h3>Age appropriate and preference-based profiles</h3><p>After pairing a nemCall-Watch, you have the option of setting up the watch with a <strong>wizard</strong>, maximum mode or in minimum mode. While in minimum mode all functions are reduced to a minimum by default and in maximum mode all functions are activated, the assistant offers the possibility to activate and define the <strong>settings of the watch based on the age of your child as well as on your selected preferences</strong> (in the categories monitoring, emergency, communication, freedom, independence, etc.). </p><p>We have previously evaluated the preset ""profiles"" in a large number of tests with parents to make it as easy as possible for you to set them up. Of course you can edit all these presets manually and adapt them to your individual needs. </p><h3>More than just a gadget</h3><p>The functional range of the clock is already very extensive, but even we cannot think of everything yet. In order to be able to extend the range of functions in the future, we are currently planning an <strong>App Store</strong> in which you can download further <strong>educational game and learning apps</strong> for the watch and install them on the nemCall-Watch. </p><h2>The smartwatch for children of safety-oriented parents</h2><h3>Protection for your data</h3><p>In order to offer you the <strong>highest level of protection</strong>, all communication with our servers hosted in Europe takes place with <strong>256-bit encryption</strong> according to the latest security standards. In addition, all data is stored on the servers in encrypted form. If you permit it, the data can be transmitted unencrypted to security authorities in emergency situations. </p><h3>Security thought ahead</h3><p>Hubs the extensive setting options for tracking the nemCall-Watch, you can define <strong>security zones</strong> (GPS-Fence) time-coupled and temporary so when they leave the zone you will be automatically notified.  But also <strong>emergency contacts</strong>, emergency settings, <strong>disaster warnings</strong> (via catwarn), <strong>first-aider information</strong> (with ICEdot) and much more is already integrated to provide you with a maximum of safety for your child. </p><h3>When the situation gets serious</h3><p>In addition to an <strong>SOS emergency call button</strong>, nemCall has two built-in cameras that are activated immediately after the emergency call is triggered.  The recorded images including the ambient noise and the current position are then continuously sent to our servers until you deactivate the alert in the app.  If the child gets lost, it can simply send its location to you. Using <strong>GPS tracking, WiFi localization</strong> and <strong>GSM triangulation</strong>, you can also locate your child at any time - or check the <strong>72-hour history</strong> of where the little ones have been.</p><h2>The nemCall App - Clear, Intuitive, Innovative</h2><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556540090/ecvhrb1tyl6dnlros2gh.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>After pairing with a nemCall-Watch, a map is displayed with the current position of the paired nemCall-Watch. Clicking on the marker opens the context menu from which you can call the watch (voice or video call), send a message / emoji or access one of the many other functions. </p><h3>Useful for the whole family</h3><p>Tasks and schedulers, timetables and much more make it much easier for the modern family to coordinate. You can also set the alarm clock on the watch using the app, mute the watch during school and much more... </p><h3>You decide who has access</h3><p>As the first paired device, <strong>you have full control</strong> over who has access to the respective nemCall-Watch and who doesn't. The sophisticated rights system is based on different user groups to which you can assign different authorizations. In addition, all security-relevant setting changes must be confirmed on your end.</p><h3>APP Development</h3><p>It goes without saying that the software of our products is developed and programmed in Europe in compliance with all data protection regulations and that the data storage on our servers is <strong>completely encrypted</strong> and carried out in <strong>European datacenters</strong> with the highest level of protection against downtime and state-of-the-art security mechanisms.</p><h2>The people behind nemCall</h2><p>We, the founding team, consist of four successful independent entrepreneurs with different expertise and backgrounds who have come together for a common goal: We want to create products that serve the whole family and make family life and its everyday needs easier, safer, and more enjoyable, with more freedom and leisure. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556116787/xfuqenvcmo6nr2f9ekgu.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Due to the different specializations, as well as the professional and private interests of the founders, every aspect and every feature of the product is controversially discussed, analyzed and, depending on feasibility and relevance, optimally implemented or postponed or discarded. </p><p>Our philosophy is always to put the benefit and handling first.

To face that battle we work close together with a award-wining app developer team in Denmark, to make sure we can meet the highest security standards in the market right now. </p><p>Not only will we be able to update the watches over the air, we will own the source code of the chips and components in the watch to make sure that there is no backdoor or any security flaw in there. </p><p>All ip-based communication and exchanged/stored informations will be encrypted. Only the parents (admin-app) can decide who gets access to these informations. Additional our data center is in the EU and will be monitored all the time as there are over 600.000 parents already trusting the systems with their own and their kids personal data. </p><p>The biggest challenge is therefore the development of the software, since even small errors can lead to security gaps, which pose a great risk both for parents and children. </p><p>Since our software has to be simple and understandable for all users, we will make the app available to a test group together with the first version of the clock after the beta version has been completed, and will put it through its paces. If the subsequent evaluation of the test shows that we need to make fundamental changes to the app or watch, this could result in a delay of 4 to 6 weeks. </p><p>As this product is worn by children, all components must of course be tested for their health compatibility and technical safety. In addition to a CE test, we will also carry out a TÜV test and have RSA values examined. Since we are dependent on external companies for this, unforeseeable waiting times can occur, which can also lead to a delay of the project.</p><p> </p></div>","Die Deutsche Übersetzung findet Ihr auf www.nemcall.comnemCall is the smartest children's watch evernemCall is not only a watch, a mobile phone or a camera, it is also a GPS and fitness tracker for children.

But that's not so easy if you can't read the watch yet. With symbols nemCall wants to help the kids to be more independent in everyday life. And, of course, they also get to know the time in a playful way. Telephoning made easyYou define the contacts (in the app) that your child can call and also those that can call your child. Your child can select the desired person from the contacts (with picture or symbol) and call them by simply touching them. If the person they want to reach is not available, your child can send a voice message. In an emergency, your child can also reach you (and up to 3 other people) immediately by pressing the SOS button for 4 seconds.In addition to excellent voice quality, the watch also has a front camera so you can not only hear but also see your child. Of course, your child can also see you on the phone and all communication is encrypted to protect you and your child.Capturing and sharing momentsHow many times have you taken a picture of a beautiful moment in your life and shared it with friends and family? Your child now has this opportunity too (when you activate it). Your child can now take photos and videos and share them with family and friends. More exercise playfullyYour children will be rewarded for exercise (steps and/or calories) with points, which in return open up new playing possibilities. As parents, for example, you can offer your kids a reward system in which you may read two bedtime stories instead of one, or allow them to watch a episode of their favourite series when they reach a certain score. Tasks and schedulingWith the app on the smartphone, parents create a visual schedule for their children. Light vibrations and icon pop-ups draw the children's attention to their memories. The look is designed for children between the ages of 4 and 10, with the clock displaying the time and associated icons that children use to perform specific tasks or functions.Individual and adaptableIn addition to customizing background images and entire themes, you can replace the silicone wristband, which also protects the watch and is equipped with an NFC chip, at any time without tools. This makes the watch even more flexible and it can also be worn as a necklace or attached to clothing with a clip as well.You are in controlThe development of a child progresses rapidly and there is always something new to discover. In order not to disturb this development, access to the digital world should not be too early and certainly not unattended. Nevertheless, the digital world offers many possibilities to make life easier for families and especially for living together. In order to solve this balancing act, we have invested a lot of time and effort in the development of the app and software to leave you in control, while not leaving you alone with tons of functions. With nemCall, your children can call you freely, but they have no possibility to play uncontrolled mobile games or access content from the Internet.The nemCall-Watch adapts to your wishesOf course, you can determine who can be called from the nemCall-Watch or who can call your child's nemCall-Watch. Via the admin app you also have the possibility to activate or deactivate functions of the watch, depending on which of the functions you consider useful for your child. Age appropriate and preference-based profilesAfter pairing a nemCall-Watch, you have the option of setting up the watch with a wizard, maximum mode or in minimum mode. While in minimum mode all functions are reduced to a minimum by default and in maximum mode all functions are activated, the assistant offers the possibility to activate and define the settings of the watch based on the age of your child as well as on your selected preferences (in the categories monitoring, emergency, communication, freedom, independence, etc.). We have previously evaluated the preset ""profiles"" in a large number of tests with parents to make it as easy as possible for you to set them up. Of course you can edit all these presets manually and adapt them to your individual needs. More than just a gadgetThe functional range of the clock is already very extensive, but even we cannot think of everything yet. In order to be able to extend the range of functions in the future, we are currently planning an App Store in which you can download further educational game and learning apps for the watch and install them on the nemCall-Watch. The smartwatch for children of safety-oriented parentsProtection for your dataIn order to offer you the highest level of protection, all communication with our servers hosted in Europe takes place with 256-bit encryption according to the latest security standards. In addition, all data is stored on the servers in encrypted form. If you permit it, the data can be transmitted unencrypted to security authorities in emergency situations. Security thought aheadHubs the extensive setting options for tracking the nemCall-Watch, you can define security zones (GPS-Fence) time-coupled and temporary so when they leave the zone you will be automatically notified.  But also emergency contacts, emergency settings, disaster warnings (via catwarn), first-aider information (with ICEdot) and much more is already integrated to provide you with a maximum of safety for your child. When the situation gets seriousIn addition to an SOS emergency call button, nemCall has two built-in cameras that are activated immediately after the emergency call is triggered.  The recorded images including the ambient noise and the current position are then continuously sent to our servers until you deactivate the alert in the app.  If the child gets lost, it can simply send its location to you. Using GPS tracking, WiFi localization and GSM triangulation, you can also locate your child at any time - or check the 72-hour history of where the little ones have been.The nemCall App - Clear, Intuitive, InnovativeAfter pairing with a nemCall-Watch, a map is displayed with the current position of the paired nemCall-Watch. Clicking on the marker opens the context menu from which you can call the watch (voice or video call), send a message / emoji or access one of the many other functions. Useful for the whole familyTasks and schedulers, timetables and much more make it much easier for the modern family to coordinate. You can also set the alarm clock on the watch using the app, mute the watch during school and much more... You decide who has accessAs the first paired device, you have full control over who has access to the respective nemCall-Watch and who doesn't. The sophisticated rights system is based on different user groups to which you can assign different authorizations. In addition, all security-relevant setting changes must be confirmed on your end.APP DevelopmentIt goes without saying that the software of our products is developed and programmed in Europe in compliance with all data protection regulations and that the data storage on our servers is completely encrypted and carried out in European datacenters with the highest level of protection against downtime and state-of-the-art security mechanisms.The people behind nemCallWe, the founding team, consist of four successful independent entrepreneurs with different expertise and backgrounds who have come together for a common goal: We want to create products that serve the whole family and make family life and its everyday needs easier, safer, and more enjoyable, with more freedom and leisure. Due to the different specializations, as well as the professional and private interests of the founders, every aspect and every feature of the product is controversially discussed, analyzed and, depending on feasibility and relevance, optimally implemented or postponed or discarded. Our philosophy is always to put the benefit and handling first. If we discover that a desired function or feature causes more problems for the user than it promises in terms of benefits, we will not integrate it into the function portfolio.Follow us and help spread the wordGet the latest updates and help us to spread the word so we can make this great product happening. All support is very appreciated!Risks and challengesWe know that security and privacy is the most important part, we have to take care of. To face that battle we work close together with a award-wining app developer team in Denmark, to make sure we can meet the highest security standards in the market right now. Not only will we be able to update the watches over the air, we will own the source code of the chips and components in the watch to make sure that there is no backdoor or any security flaw in there. All ip-based communication and exchanged/stored informations will be encrypted. Only the parents (admin-app) can decide who gets access to these informations. Additional our data center is in the EU and will be monitored all the time as there are over 600.000 parents already trusting the systems with their own and their kids personal data. The biggest challenge is therefore the development of the software, since even small errors can lead to security gaps, which pose a great risk both for parents and children. Since our software has to be simple and understandable for all users, we will make the app available to a test group together with the first version of the clock after the beta version has been completed, and will put it through its paces. If the subsequent evaluation of the test shows that we need to make fundamental changes to the app or watch, this could result in a delay of 4 to 6 weeks. As this product is worn by children, all components must of course be tested for their health compatibility and technical safety. In addition to a CE test, we will also carry out a TÜV test and have RSA values examined. Since we are dependent on external companies for this, unforeseeable waiting times can occur, which can also lead to a delay of the project.",19.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3><strong>My story - Origin of IDEA</strong></h3>
<p>hello everybody! I'm Sushmita Bisannah from India,Hyderabad working as a fashion designer since two years. Studying fashion and getting into this job wasn't that easy in my life. I had to go  through tough hurdles to get to this place.  I was the happiest person on the earth when i got my dream job. I always has plenty of work in my hands which kept me engaged all the time and i loved that.  I enjoyed every bit of my work, like talking to clients, knowing their requirements, Inspecting production and execution, exploring trends, material procurement, handling bunch of workers &amp; late deliveries, quoting bills, and my OTs, everything. </p>
<p>                                                      And that was one of my routine days, i was just browsing through and accidentally redirected to an article saying TEXTILE POLLUTION. I felt it interesting and started reading the article. That article shook me up,  I literally never knew that Textile pollution is the SECOND MOST POLLUTION globally. and 15 million tons of textiles are being dumped every year according to statistics. and most of them are synthetics which takes up to 60 years and above to decompose. Just one thought made me restless i.e THEN HOW MANY YEARS DOES IT TAKE TO DECOMPOSE ALL OF THEM? AND WHAT IS THE FUTURE?</p>
<p>                                                     After a week of research and analysis I came up with an idea. A concept of creating garments using only(90%)  hand-made, eco-friendly and bio-degradable fabrics with three prime principles Remodel-Reuse-Recycle, which derives SUSTAINABLE FASHION. The fabrics which we work with decomposes very quickly compared to synthetics, yet we try not to dump but Recycle.</p>
<p><strong>IMPLEMENTATION</strong></p>
<p>Concept was good, but i was wondering how many people would prefer these fabrics over synthetics since synthetics are the cheaper pick. First I tried them on me and referred it to few of my friends and the response was AWESOME. They loved the designs since they are trendy yet comfortable. When I was actually getting the orders, I couldn't believe myself that there were so many people who would want to go eco-friendly and that gave me lot of confidence. But I couldn't manage to take many of them cause neither I had my own space to meet the clients nor the workshop to work on, and Time was another issue since I work in somewhere my whole day. Then I understood the need of launching the start-up of this sustainable fashion label but It wasn't that easy since It needed lot of money into it. Then I started searching for the possibilities to make it happen</p>
<p> <strong>THIS ONE STOP</strong></p>
<p>After many trials and failures, after so much of exploration I stopped at this one place to share my thoughts and Ideas with the people who actually would understand and care. YOU guyz are our BEST POSSIBILITY to make it happen.  Me and my team need you to make our campaign successful and give our Start-up a shape. Please do help us to make it Stand and Serve</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The TWISTLET  is a product that would be perfect for Anyone who wants to carry the essentials, phone, keys, money and lipstick,  and be hands-free/care free!   There is nothing on the market like it.  I actually came up with the idea sitting on the beach wanting to leave my beach chair to go for a walk, and I had no idea how to carry my ""essentials"" so as not to leave my valuables behind.  After observing a multitude women walking the beach in bathing suits (with no pockets), carrying their beach bags, leather purses, phones in their hands, etc.,  I realized my idea had value.   Hence, the first neoprene Twistlet (a twist on the wristlet), came to be.  At that time I was a teacher (recently retired), and I made them for all my teacher friends who used them for carrying their phones, keys, money, to lunch duty, bus duty, meetings, etc.  The TWISTLET  became a staple of our schools.  I refined my idea, and after I retired last year from teaching (after 30 years), began experimenting with different fabrics and now have the pattern and look I want to include luxurious reversible stretch velvets, sequin lined with stretch velvet as well as bright water-resistant neoprene fabric.  </p>
<p>I first sold the TWISTLET in the French Market in New Orleans and soon realized they were a hit; not only were they cute and classy, they carried the essentials safely and conveniently.</p>
<p>With funding, I can move the TWISTLET into manufacturing and marketing on a much larger scale.  My product has all the makings of a new approach to simplicity and minimalism that is both timely and highly sought after by a myriad of individuals.  It is both clever and functional, and it will be a problem-solver for those looking for convenience, sensibility, and comfort without foregoing style.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>TWISTLET is a dually patented product with both Design and Utility Patents filed, and the Trademark is secured.  The TWISTLET project needs manufacturing and marketing funds to move forward, with hopes of securing $100,000 of which 75% will be used for manufacturing costs and 25% for marketing.    For those individuals who contribute to our project, for each $25, a TWISTLET will be mailed to the donator.  If we do not reach our entire goal, the contributed funds will still go to manufacturing and marketing.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The TWISTLET is all about freedom: freedom from having to carry a purse or handbag and still being able carry all of the essentials.  Traditional purses and handbags were definitely not all designed for convenience, activity or safety, or comfortable portability; however, the TWISTLET is!  No matter where you're heading, just grab your essentials and go; lock in your keys, slide in your phone, tuck in your money, and don’t forget the lipstick!  The TWISTLET is the compact and convenient bag that comes in styles from fashionable and stylish to rugged and weather-ready.  One simple turn of TWISTLET's patented straps keeps your belongings safe and secure and creates a hands-free/care-free carrying experience.</p>
<p>In the first three months of sales at a community market in New Orleans, the TWISTLET was purchased by folks from 11 countries and 42 states (pre-COVID, obviously).  It is such a unique product that folks purchased them for themselves as well as their friends and family members.  There were some customers who were buying a dozen at a time!  The TWISTLET is guaranteed to be a game changer when it comes to convenience, functionality, and design.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>TWISTLET is ready for major production and searching for the right manufacturer.  While several estimates have been received from west coast manufacturers, there still hasn't been the ideal offer.  Presently, The TWISTLET is being manufactured in southwest Louisiana by a small seamstress company, Sew What.  They do impeccable and amazing work, and approximately five seamstresses are employed to construct the product.  There is hope that TWISTLET can be manufactured by such a loving company, and that is the type of manufacturer we are hoping to find.  At this time, Sew What, is not able to up the production without more machinery and staff to meet our needs.  If that were to change, I would not hesitate using Sew What as the manufacturer of TWISTLET.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>As social media becomes more and more the marketing approach, TWISTLET is happy to be a center of attention.  Any shout outs or happy customer pics of the TWISTLET  would be quite beneficial to getting the word out.  Using the Indiegogo share tools would be just a wonderful way to help us!</p>

<p>Today, considering the environmental impact of any product is essential. We care about protecting the environment for future generations so Me Next's outsole and the internal buffer structure were designed to use thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), a plastic material that is recyclable, non-toxic and environmentally friendly. Moreover, the TPU material lasts longer than typical footwear to extend the lifecycle of the shoes.</p>

</div></div>","Me Next is all about comfort, enjoy comfort is an attitude and the way to express a lifestyle. A comfortable lifestyle should start with choosing a great pair of shoes.
Therefore, we decided to use groundbreaking technology and the top-notch supply chain to create a new brand Me Next, which will completely subvert people's imagination of the comfort of shoes. We call it ""Be Perfectly comfortable, Always.""
 

 

 

 

 
A special gradient sandwich structure, a concept used in the aerospace field has been applied to the midsole design for the very first time in footwear. Compared to other structures with the same weight and material, this design has the best buffer performance and shock absorption capability.
 

 
 

 

 
The gradient sandwich structure originated from the aerospace field, this structure was used by flight vehicles to absorb energy when the aircraft was hit by space debris and meteorites, significantly reduce the impact damage to the main structure. Me Next’s midsole: The bottom layer is designed for absorbing energy from the ground, the middle layer is made for energy storage and transmission, and the top layer can return more energy as force is applied to efficiently reduce fatigue caused by long-distance walking.
 

 

 
Unrestricted Airflow And Breathability.
The structurally ordered midsole provides unrestricted airflow and breathability in all directions, which helps to remove moisture and prevent sweat and odors.
 



 
Technology & Material
The midsole buffer structure is made with micron-sized TPU powder as the raw material and uses SLS high-precision 3D printing technology under a nitrogen atmosphere. The midsole consists of more than 762 cushioning units, which completely protect the pressure points of your feet.
 

 

 
Durable, Protective & Comfortable
The world first uses an embedded design, combining a 3D printed structure with the outer shoe frame of the sole.

 Inserting the Gradient Sandwich Structures into the sole, provides a great solution to problems that avoids gravel that damages the form of the shoe sole. 
 The outer frame structure has a particular mechanical ability, which can control the deformation direction of gradient sandwich structures and effectively avoid the imbalance of the human center of gravity. 
 The perfect combination of practicality and transparent appearancestylish unique design.

 

 

 

 
Today, considering the environmental impact of any product is essential. We care about protecting the environment for future generations so Me Next's outsole and the internal buffer structure were designed to use thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), a plastic material that is recyclable, non-toxic and environmentally friendly. Moreover, the TPU material lasts longer than typical footwear to extend the lifecycle of the shoes.
 
 
 

 
Workout Companion
Me Next excels at any workout or exercise such as cross-training, cycling, HIIT, jogging, and more. The midsole buffer structure can decrease the impact of your steps and cushion the foot from heavy landings. Boost your workout performance with Me Next!
 

 

 

 
Daily Life
Me Next is perfect for walking and daily wear with excellent shock absorption capability for any activity. Great cushioning properties effectively reduce the damage on the knee joints and help you feel better all day.
 

 

 


 


 

 
By focusing on fashion, sustainability, and quality at the same time, Me Next provides 3 different styles that can express different personalities in a unique way.
 (Sailor) Inspired by an aerodynamic design from the sports car. Yellow, blue, and black combined together are interlaced to release visual impact. Sailor represents the combination of power & beauty.
 

 
(Shadow) Global warming has accelerated the melting of Antarctica's glaciers, and the environment in Antarctica has also been deteriorating. We are using 3M™ reflective fabric to draw out penguins' images and express our deep concern about the Antarctica environment. We want to express our worries about climate warming through Shadow and remind people to protect the environment.

 
(Sunday) The inspiration comes from the facial design of Sichuan Opera. A bold attempt by combining traditional Chinese culture and modern design.

1.Stand straight with your feet on a piece of paper and your heels against the wall, then draw a line around your foot.
2. Measure the length of your foot from the tip to the heel.
3. Compare your foot length with our size chart to choose a perfect size for your sneakers.
*We recommend sizing up for a wider fit or sizing down for a narrow fit if you typically are between two sizes.",53.0,0,"1 Campaign

After all, the workstation is where many of us spend the majority of our time during the days, so it is necessary to create a healthy and sustainable environment.Flick has a built-in-incline that always provides you with an optimal angle towards the computer mouse, no matter where you move your arm. This angle gives you a better ergonomic position to help you sustain a healthy use of your computer mouse while working long hours.Furthermore, Flick is covered with PTFE on the underside to reduce friction towards the surface as much as possible. PTFE is the same material commonly referred to as mouse skates, which are usually placed on the underside of your computer mouse. This means that your arm and hand will have the same friction as your mouse, which will, in turn, allow more effortless movements.Flick is also equipped with memory foam on the inside, to provide extreme comfort, and a custom user experience so that every product is shaped according to the user's arm.The memory foam also naturally induces slight supination of the wrist, which is a better ergonomic position than the normally fully pronated position.Finally, at the front Flick has a rotation support. The rotation support works as a perfect pressure point to relieve pressure from other parts of the arm that would lead to injuries, and ensures that the wrist is in a controlled and safe rotation for better stability. Our new flow design enables you to rotate freely with the rotation support at all times.Flick is placed in front of your computer mouse, and is extremely easy to use. It is highly manageable for all types of work duties, and is designed to fit in at your workstation as a beautiful accessory. It comes in different sizes and two different colors, Obsidian Black & Pearl White.We have a long history with Kickstarter & Indiegogo, and that is the reason why we got started in the first place, and the reason why we can continue to create products that bring great value for our customers. Because of that, we always make sure to create exclusive rewards for our backers, with huge discounts. We try to set the prices as low as possible, in order to provide our amazing crowdfunding community with a unique opportunity.  After the Indiegogoo campaign, Flick will be sold online and in retail stores. The retail prices will differ a lot from the Indiegogo prices. Below is a compilation of the exclusive Indiegogo prices:Early Bird | Flick ($79) - Retail price $139 USD, 45% off (save $60 USD).Indiegogo | Flick ($89) - Retail price $139 USD, 35% off (save $50 USD). Early Bird | Flick Co-worker ($139) - Retail price $278 USD, 50% off (save $139 USD).Indiegogo | Flick Co-worker ($165) - Retail price $278 USD, 40% off (save $113 USD).  Early Bird | Flick Team ($319) - Retail price $695 USD, 55% off (save $376 USD). Indiegogo | Flick Team ($379) - Retail price $695 USD, 45% off (save $316 USD).  Early Bird | Flick Office ($1109) - Retail price $2780 USD, 60% off (save $1671 USD). Indiegogo | Flick Office ($1389) - Retail price $2780 USD, 50% off (save $1391 USD).A team of passionate product developers, engineers, designers, and creative minds who care deeply about our customers, and the future of working ergonomics. We want to create a healthy and productive future for everyone that spends the majority of their day working at a desk. We started out in Esports, and have since the beginning launch several products. The first products were the Gaming Glove & the Gaming Sleeve. After that, we released Xdapter, followed by Xsleeve in November 2020. However, we quickly realized that many of our customers use our products at the office, or at home for work. So we decided it was time to make a product that was better suited for that type of work. After receiving feedback from thousands of users of our previous products, we used all that knowledge to develop Flick. We are so happy to finally share all of our hard work with the world and continue on our mission to create a healthy working environment for everyone. In 2018, we launched our first Kickstarter project. It all started when Oskar Ödmark (founder) suffered from a shoulder injury related to movement with a computer mouse and took a break from gaming, with rehab training for almost 2 years. After struggling for so many years with high friction and unstable movement, he wanted to find a solution for the problems that people encounter every day while using a computer mouse. He then developed the first edition of the Flashe Gaming Glove. For the first time in many years, he didn't feel the stress on the shoulders that he usually would after long hours in front of the computer, and his gameplay was improving drastically. Oskar knew that this was something that could potentially help millions of people around the globe. With a never-ending passion for helping people with repetitive stress injuries, Oskar launched Flashe Gaming Group in 2018. The first Kickstarter campaign became an immediate success, and this enabled Flashe Gaming Group to extend its team and its product portfolio. With new innovation, engineering, and design, we aim to revolutionize the ergonomic industry. The second Kickstarter was Xdapter: 6-in-1 invisible adapter. Xdapter has helped thousands of people around the globe become more minimalistic and enabled them to use their phone at work instead of a laptop.  Finally, in November 2020, we launched Xsleeve: Esports Performance & Ergonomics. Xsleeve is a specially engineered and designed gaming compression arm-sleeve with PTFE on the underside for reduced friction. Xsleeve was delivered to our backers in record-time; only 2 weeks after the campaign ended! With all this experience from Kickstarter, we know what it takes to launch and deliver a successful crowdfunding project. We are forever grateful for all the amazing support we have received throughout the years. After raising $185 000 USD from 3 projects, we are now very happy to introduce Flick.How does the reward/perk system work?You can only pledge for 1 reward, so make sure that the one you pick has the correct amount of Flick that you want.  How much does Flick cost?The price for Flick on Indiegogo ranges from $79 USD - $1389 USD depending on how many you back. Flick as a base product is made out of expensive high-quality materials, and compared to other products on the market that might have 1 or 2 ergonomic components, Flick combines 4 Key components to ensure an optimal ergonomic product. These components are also made of expensive high-quality materials, including:- Memory foam- PTFE underside- Rotation support - Embedded incline When do I get to choose the size and color for Flick?We will contact everyone with surveys that will be sent to your email after the campaign has ended. In the survey you will find size sheets, so you'll know which size fits you. The survey will also include color options. How do I know which size fits me?Together with the survey, we will send size charts so you will be able to measure with ease what size you need. Is Flick washable?Flick won't really need to be washed, but if you'll need it, Flick can be hand-washed. Does Flick support ambidextrous use?Yes, Flick can be used by left-handed and right-handed users. What are the shipping costs?The shipping costs start from 9 USD, and depending on how many products you have in your pledge, it might increase up to a maximum of 90 USD. When will you send surveys?We will send out surveys as soon as possible after the campaign has ended, in order to speed up the delivery process as much as possible. How do I get in contact with your team?The easiest and fastest way is to message the creator (Oskar Ödmark) here on Indiegogo, and someone from our team will get in touch. You can also comment on our Indiegogo project page. Risks and challengesThis is our 4th crowdfunding project, and needless to say; we've learned a lot during the past few years. Making hardware is almost always a difficult process. We've overcome many obstacles, and solved problems that will save us a lot of time for this project. Making products that bring value to our customers is the key to all things we make. Since Flick is the first of its kind, and since there is nothing similar to it on the market, it could potentially lead to delays in manufacturing. However, we are confident about the capability of the product and possess deep knowledge of all the fundamental components. That being said, Flick is a complex product and we hold ourselves to incredibly high standards in terms of quality and experience. We won’t ship unless we are confident we have met or exceeded these standards. We've done everything we can to set ourselves up to be ready and on time to solve unanticipated delays. If something does come up, we will be forthright and transparent about it. Having done 3 successful crowdfunding projects before, we know that we have a very capable team that can solve all different kinds of problems that come our way. Environmental commitmentsLong-lasting designWe expect that Flick will last all users a very long time.

In fact there is a huge variety in the market, that could produce an ""OK"" watch within an expected price. But our wish was to provide something Special at the Best Price.To do that we had to find a powerful core for our watch, it's power generator.  ETA 2824-2 Automatic Mvt was the obvious choice. Automatic, tested, durable ,Swiss, used by Breitling, Omega, Tissot, Hamilton and others.         ETA 2824-2 ensures the THETA Icarus reliability, longevity and accuracy.                                                       Jewels are synthetically produced rubies, which are used to reduce friction in the main bearings of the moving parts of a watch movement. For complicated watches such as with automatic winding,  the number of jewels necessarily increases.THETA Icarus Automatic movement has 25 Jewels.  ETA 2824-2 operates at the Swiss standard 28,800 beats per hour.    Regulator System ETACHRON and Regulator Collector    The handmade rotor is included in THETA Icarus Automatic with engraved THETA logo.  An automatic watch is a living thing, as you soon discover when you hold one for the first time. One of the beauties of them is that the seconds hand travels in a smooth ""sweep"".  Having secured the ETA 2824-2 Automatic Movement,the next step was to make a Strong, Elegant case to Protect it. So, we chose this Beautiful, Brushed 316L Stainless Steel, with a Screw Down Diamond Crown.            Sapphire glass is created by crystallizing corundum, or aluminium oxide, at temperatures of 4000° F and then by moulding the mixture into clear disks. These disks are then machined to the proper crystal size, polished and perfectly fit to the watch case.Combined with sapphire crystal at both sides , improved with a Double Anti-reflective Coating. Double Domed: The arch on both sides of the Sapphire Crystal makes it better able to dissipate the forces of impact and once treated with an inner Anti-reflective coating it looks almost like a quality lens, the dial really sharp and clear. The Sapphire Glass width is 38.5 mm.Strength and hardnessWith a hardness of 9 on the Mohs scale it has a considerably higher scratch resistance and a resistance to fracture than mineral glass. With these properties, it is only  exceeded by diamond (Mohs hardness of 10). Stereo indexes and minute hands, as well as the markings on the dial are covered with strong luminescence, Super Luminova C3. This makes reading the time easy, is aesthetically pleasing during the day and gives you great visibility at night.                      THETA Icarus Automatic is Water Resistant more than 5 ATM / 50 M.           The THETA Icarus secures on the wrist with a Double Butterfly Deployant Stainless Steel Buckle which carries the engraved THETA logo.     Each THETA Icarus watch is equipped with an advance Italian, Anti-allergic, Genuine  Calf Leather strap, allowing you to enjoy a luxurious feeling.This leather will last for ages and is very comfortable to wear.Each strap also has what we call “Quick Release Pins” so you can change your strap in just a few seconds without any tools.     Domed Anti-reflective Sapphire Glass at front and Anti-reflective Sapphire Glass at back, you are given the opportunity to admire the Harmonious Motion of the Heart of the New THETA Icarus Automatic Watch.    Our classical design ensures a Durable Construction for years to come.  THETA Icarus isn't a smart watch. It has Heart and Soul, like YOU.                               THETA Icarus Series In the beginning of the campaign we will have two different cases: silver and rose gold, plus two different colour bands: black and brown.Furthermore, THETA offers the option of engraving a Message on the back case or a Name to every new owner of THETA Icarus watch. This option will be available once we reach the milestone of 500 produced units.  TESTINGAll watches and movements are tested for accuracy, water resistance and durability.   ASSEMBLINGOur watchmakers will take great care during the assembly of your THETA watch.   Wear Your Personal Style on Your Wrist    For HimProvided in a variety of cases, bezel and band colours, at the size of 43 mm, Icarus is the ideal choice for a masculine, sport or casual style.   For HerBut according to fashion trends it would suit perfectly on a woman's wrist, just as well.     A Luxury Time-peace For Every Moment   Do not compromise - Get the Best    Warranty and Packing For every new purchased watch we grant legal warranty of 2 years.Warranty contains the remedy of all defects, which are free of charge and referable to material or production defects.

Once we place the order with our suppliers, they will start the manufacturing and assembly of the different parts of the watch. The completed and assembled watches will then be shipped to us for final inspection and testing. The only thing missing is the initial order fee.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The aim of this campaign is to solve one of humanity's most urgent and pressing problems: the complete lack of fully functional, realistic human scrotum apparel available in the world today.



Although the video may suggest otherwise, this is an actual and legitimate project. 
The aim of this campaign is to produce sturdy, functional, durable, high quality and of course stylish Scrote'n'Tote backpacks to be made available to aesthetes  all over the world. 
The funding goal of $33,000 will cover the cost of producing the mold for the skin textured part of the bag, which is the biggest pre-production expense.  The money also covers various research costs including testing out different materials, different methods for attaching the skin part to the backpack part, producing various prototypes, quality tests, trying out different production facilities in different locations to see who can make the best product, etc.  Once we have enough sales to produce the first run, they'll be made and shipped, from various distribution centres on different continents, so as to keep shipping costs reasonable to most countries.
The Scrote'n'Tote pre-prototype you see in the images was produced by hand by special effects prosthetics artist C.J. Goldman and is too heavy and delicate to be used as a proper backpack, on top of costing almost $1000 to produce per bag, which is why we can't use that method or materials.
Once we've produced something functional and sturdy that looks as close to the original as possible, we'll sell the Scrote'n'Totes online for $120 USD each, plus shipping.  However, everyone who donated $10 will be entitled to buy one for only $69 plus shipping, as well as getting the satisfaction of knowing that they helped bring the gift of scrotes into the world.  
There's also the option to put the whole $69 down right away which saves you the extra $10 - this will entitle you to get one Scrote'n'Tote for the cost of shipping once they are produced.




The bag was designed by me, but sculpted and made by prosthetic makeup artist C.J. Goldman, who has worked on many well known films, including the X-Men Apocalypse, The Hobbit, 300, Terminator 3, the Conan and Dawn of the Dead remakes among many others. This is not a joke, check IMDB. 






RISKS AND CHALLENGES
The main challenge is to make sure the final product looks as close to the prototype as possible while being fully functional, spacious, lightweight, durable etc. There will be some experimentation with various materials, though by now we have a pretty good idea of which materials will be used and what the costs will be.  The main risk in terms of aesthetics is that at this point we don't know if we'll be able to mass produce a hairy version or not.  Meanwhile in terms of business plan, the main challenge is to sell enough Scrotes!

Thankfully, one of the main advisors in this endeavour actually runs a handbag manufacturing company so we have a very realistic understanding of the costs, work and processes involved, and thus these numbers are based on years of experience in the field of handbag and backpack production, not just random estimates, or second hand opinions.
Note that this is a ""fixed funding"" campaign, which means that if we don't reach our funding goal, everyone gets an instant refund.






計画内容
このクラウドファンディングプロジェクト（基金計画）の目的は、人類の最も差し迫った緊急の問題：
今この世の中で機能的で現実的な人間陰嚢衣類が完全に欠如しているという問題を解決することです。
あなたの寄付金が、頑丈で高品質且つスタイリッシュ なスクロタントート（陰嚢リュックサック）を世界中のお目の高い方々に入手可能にできます。

可能な限りオリジナルに近い機能的で頑丈な品物を作り出した場合、インターネット上で一つ120アメリカドル＋送料でスクロタントート（陰嚢リュックサック）を販売します。しかし、10アメリカドル寄付して下さった皆さんは、一つたったの69アメリカドル＋送料で購入可能であり、又、スクロウトというギフトを世界へもらせたという満足感を得ていただくことができます。
資金調達目標額（約$ 33,000 アメリカドル相当）は、生産前段階の最大の必要経費であるバックの皮膚感を作り出す為の費用に使われます。寄付金は、色々な素材や様々な方法でスキンパーツをリュックサック部分に繋げる様にできるかを試験したり、どの製造会社が最高級の品物を作り出すことができるかを見極める為に異なる場所での種々の製造設備を試したり等の様々な小規模の調査費用にもあてがわれます。

映像でご覧になったスクロタントート（陰嚢リュックサック）原型は、特殊メイクアーティストのCJゴールドマンによって手がけられたものです。
あの原型は、映画の小道具として作成され、約＄1,000（千ドル＝10万相当）の費用を用い特有なリュックサックとして使用される為に重く繊細に作られていた為に同様の製作方法や素材を使用することができません。


危険性と課題
主な課題は、最終製品が機能的でバッグの中に十分なスペースがあり、軽量で耐久性があり、できるだけ原型に近い様相の仕上がりになることです。
ありがたいことに、この企画に携わっているパートナーの一人は、ハンドバッグの製造会社運営を援助している為、私達は関与コスト、作業やプロセスに関してとても現実的な理解を持っています。従って、これらの数字は不特定な見積もりや人づての見解ではなく、ハンドバッグやリュックサック生産の分野で長年の経験に基づいていたものです。
多様な素材にて幾つかのテストがこれから行われますが、この時点で唯一重要なことは私達が毛の部分をもっと優れた見た目にできるか、それとも最終製品が無毛の状態になるかということです。
唯一の他の主なリスクとは、新製品開発に伴う通常起こりうる予測不可能な事や障害がもたらたす生産スケジュールの遅延です。",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

High fashion is more than exclusivity, it is an space where fashion designers can translate its creativity and expressiveness to designs carefully crafted.  In order to be considered as part of haute couture firms need to present at least two collections per year in Paris, with 35 different looks, between day and night designs. It is necessary to have an atelier with no less than 20 artisans working full time and dedicate between 100 and 1000 hours per each garment. The designer must guarantee the exclusivity of the fabrics used, and each clothing needs to be custom to each client, who will have to perform three tests before the delivery.</p><p>Along the first half of the XX Century the French haute couture growth quite fast and it reach its golden period with the consolidation of firms such as Dior, from Christian Dior, Channel, from Coco Chanel, or Balenciaga, from Cristobal Balenciaga, among others. The effects of the Second World War reduced the number of people who were able to afford high fashion clothes, and the haute couture went through its lowest hours. Pierre Cardin was one of the pioneers to promote a new system of patterns which allowed designs to be mass produced and expose them in shops, in different sizes, ready to be dressed.</p><p>Now a days the lines of great fashion firms such as Channel or Dolce &amp; Gabbana present yearly their prêt-à-porter collections, more accessible than the haute couture designs, but still with a high quality. The collections are mass produced, in different sizes, but still not affordable for everyone.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1598432860/pka4dqkc5hwtei7hsnru.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h2>Mission, Vision, Values</h2><p><strong>MISSION</strong></p><p>To reinvent the high fashion style bringing innovation and inspiration to fashion lovers, by creating clothing through the fusion of the concepts of streetwear and the elegance.

High fashion is more than exclusivity, it is an space where fashion designers can translate its creativity and expressiveness to designs carefully crafted.  In order to be considered as part of haute couture firms need to present at least two collections per year in Paris, with 35 different looks, between day and night designs. It is necessary to have an atelier with no less than 20 artisans working full time and dedicate between 100 and 1000 hours per each garment. The designer must guarantee the exclusivity of the fabrics used, and each clothing needs to be custom to each client, who will have to perform three tests before the delivery.Along the first half of the XX Century the French haute couture growth quite fast and it reach its golden period with the consolidation of firms such as Dior, from Christian Dior, Channel, from Coco Chanel, or Balenciaga, from Cristobal Balenciaga, among others. The effects of the Second World War reduced the number of people who were able to afford high fashion clothes, and the haute couture went through its lowest hours. Pierre Cardin was one of the pioneers to promote a new system of patterns which allowed designs to be mass produced and expose them in shops, in different sizes, ready to be dressed.Now a days the lines of great fashion firms such as Channel or Dolce & Gabbana present yearly their prêt-à-porter collections, more accessible than the haute couture designs, but still with a high quality. The collections are mass produced, in different sizes, but still not affordable for everyone. Mission, Vision, ValuesMISSIONTo reinvent the high fashion style bringing innovation and inspiration to fashion lovers, by creating clothing through the fusion of the concepts of streetwear and the elegance. Sell exclusive clothing, ahead of trends to come, adapted to the needs of our clients.VISIONOur vision is to become more than a brand, be a movement that joints the best from high fashion and the streetwear style, by providing to our clients, prestige, exclusivity and innovation. And do it through a sustainable process along all our value chain, inspiring our stakeholders, specially our employees, to do their best for the brand.VALUESOur main values are the following:
Passion: our team has deep commitment to a project in which we strongly believe and demonstrate it through our loyalty to the brand. We put a special affection and care that can be seen in each of our pieces of clothing, achieving the quality expected from our clients.
Innovation: our passion for the project leads us to look for creative and innovative solutions in order to advance and evolve. The haute couture is part of a golden past of fashion, so that, in order to recover its essence, it is necessary to be creative and use new formulas that allow us to connect it with the contemporary streetwear style.
Excellence: we seek perfection in each minimal detail that comes out our firm, by applying the best practices in terms of management and the achievement of our goals. It is based on our both goal and client-oriented vision, leadership, perseverance and mutually beneficial alliances.
Closeness: The decisions made by our clients are based on emotion and instinct, so that our brand is committed to appeal and connect to people’s emotions. We want our clients to share the Bernicce movement values. For us is quite important to create strong emotional connection which allows us to understand better our clients and make them see the reflect of their lifestyle in our brand.
Curiosity: our employees have curiosity about the aspirations of our customers, that is why they seek for the design and production of innovative clothing that fit their most exquisite demands. Because of that they explore, learn and imagine how the brand can grow and reach its goals.  Design and FabricWe have designed a checklist that all our items need to have in order to be considered a Bernicce clothing ready to be send to our clients.We only select the premium functional fabric and components on each detail to provide the guarantees for both functional features and comfy wearing feeling How does it work? Whatever the occasion, BERNICCE clothes are ready to wearIf you need to pick an item from your closet, Bernicce clothes should be one of your first thoughts. All the clothing has been designed in order to be versatile, no matters if you are going to a casual activity or going out for party, by combining Bernicce clothes with your favourite ones, you will be ready. Easy ironThanks to the high-quality fabrics we use, you do not need to worry again either for your seasonal closet change, when travelling abroad with your case full of Bernicce clothing, or after washing the item at home. Our products are quite easy to iron so it will not take much time to have the clothing ready for going out. Hydrophobic fabricsWe use a special type of fabric which is capable to refuse the water or other liquid that may fall on it, producing a mercury effect, allowing you to keep dry and prevents your clothes from getting stained with any liquid that could fall. Now you can wear our clothes without worrying if something could dirty the clothes such as when having dinner or going out for party, our clothes will keep free of any liquid.         Classic               Hydrophobic         All our stakeholders’ mattersWe have developed a sustainable value chain since all our process, from design to delivery, is done by proximity suppliers.1. Our pieces are designed by a haute couture located in Barcelona by using the traditional techniques in its atelier.2. The designs are sent to our production workshop which will cut all the pieces of fabric and joint them handcrafted taking care of each of the piece details and complements.3. The packaging has been designed by a local company with 100% sustainable raw materials.4. We deliver all our products through a local network of deliverers. BERNICCE's ClubBernicce’s Club is a society founded for those clients closest to the brand. For every purchase made at Bernicce customers will receive Bernicce Points. These points will be accumulated by a loyalty card, with a member number. Depending on the number of points, customers will be part of different categories of members, which will give them access to different advantages such as accessing exclusive collections of the brand or having access to new designs before other buyers. Club members in the higher categories will also have access to VIO events, exclusive limited-edition products and other VIP experiences. In order to stay in this Club, customers must accumulate a minimum number of points during the year, obtained through purchases of Bernicce garments. Corporate Social Responsibility Risks and GoalsBefore the project launch, we have prepared a production plan with our manufacturing partners. The first design of the clothing has been done thanks to a partnership with a haute couture atelier and its creative designer, so we are confident we can fulfil this project and its goals. However, some unforeseen challenges or problems could still happen, especially in these uncertain years and the worldwide pandemic we are suffering. When an investor trusts us and invest in Kickstarter, a commitment between him and the Bernicce team is created, the commitment of work in order to create our products and send to them. About Us Risks & Challenges Legal adviceIndividuals (IRPF)According to the Spanish Law 29/1987, de 18 de diciembre, del Impuesto sobre Sucesiones y Donaciones, the donation done can be deducted from the yearly IRPF declaration.

<li>Represent products that promote awareness on social issues in 'Merica.</li>
<li>With each purchase, monetary support will be given to those who are active in the community and are working to relieve the issues at hand.</li>
</ul><p>This isn't new news. Clothing and apparel companies have started supporting causes more regularly. However, many times, the company dedicates all efforts to one cause or a series of relatable causes. This is where <i>We<i> </i></i>will expand. Why give all the attention to one matter when there are many out there that need addressing? Why not house all social causes under one label? The two connections each issue will have to each other are that they are issues brought to matter by society, and that they are happening right here in 'Merica. </p><p> </p><h3>
<strong>How We Can Reach Multiple Issues </strong> </h3><p>Our strategy is to launch a series of product campaigns. Each campaign will offer a fresh design that relates to a social issue. During the lifespan of the campaign:</p><ul>
<li>We will help increase public awareness</li>
<li>Make monetary contributions to the organizations that show the most success in research <u>or</u> in methods of resolving the issue.</li>
<li>So basically, the more products we sell within a campaign, the more funds we can provide to each organization. </li>

<h3>Good News and Bad News to Prepare For</h3>
<p><strong>Bad News First. </strong>With any start-up business, there is always the risk of failure. However, my strong belief is that failure is merely someone's choice to give up. One choice that isn't an option here.</p>
<p>In addition to the potential of failing, another risk is being washed out in the flooded clothing industry. But we have a niche in the market and as long as we have a strong support system, we have a shot at success!</p>
<p><strong>What's the Good News? </strong>The good news is, that even if we don't reach out funding goals, we will continue our efforts to get Herban Turtl out there! Can't stop, won't stop.</p>
<p>And for all those that support, we'd like to give you something in return for your contributions. We haven't quite figured out <i>what</i> that will be. But as our campaign matures we'll be sure to update this section.</p>
</div><h3> </h3><h3>
<b>What A Campaign Looks Like</b> </h3><p>Our first campaign will be dedicated to the research efforts of cannabis and the treatment for PTSD in our Veterans. An established connection has been made to <i>MAPS</i> (Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies) and the documentary they have sponsored <i>From Shock To Awe</i>. This documentary is expected to release by Fall 2017. Funds from this crowdfunding will help us put our design concepts into production and distribution. We will most likely utilize Shopify as it is a socially accepted e-commerce platform with abilities to connect directly to our Facebook page. We are still figuring out who our manufacturers will be based on their sustainability efforts. Originally, the plan was to release the product campaign on Memorial Day. However, so much to do with so little time! And so our crowdfunding campaign will officially kick off on Memorial Day instead with hopes to release the product campaign by end of June/early July. </p><div><h3> </h3></div><h2>
<strong>Who is <i>Me</i>?</strong> </h2><p>Hi everyone, my name is Ashley. I'm a petite, multi-cultured female who likes to smoke weed and would consider myself a working-class citizen. Each of these identifiers has made me feel <i>unqualified</i> at some point in my life. To compensate, I've developed a mantra of needing to prove everything by action. Yet this mantra evolved into the desire for perfection at everything I did which resulted in some bad anxiety issues (self-diagnosed of course because who can afford healthcare these days). And then, the unexpected happened. I got fired from my job. For the first time in my life, I wasn't the best at something and no matter how high I got, nothing could suppress the self-doubt I was having.</p><p><strong>Dramatic Much? </strong>Perhaps. But, d'you ever wonder why it's beautiful out after a crazy storm? If chaos is necessary in order to create something amazing, I was going to see this as my big ""slap-in-the-face"" clue that something great needed to come from this situation. My storm was the built up frustrations from needing to prove myself. So my beauty will be the defiance of needing to prove anything. But instead of hating on society, I wanted to create a brand that stood up for those being hated on by bringing awareness to the issues that society doesn't understand. And with each person joining me on this movement against ignorance, than we become a part of something worth representing.</p><p><strong>Thanks for sticking with Herban Turtl this far! We hope you stay for the long haul!</strong></p></div>","Hi there! We are Herban Turtl. Currently,We is just Me. But I'm hoping that you'll stick around long enough to learn about the concept and find it either relates to you or someone you know. I wouldn't want to waste your time or money on anything that you can't relate to so it makes this my risk; my gamble. The Business Concept Herban Turtl is a clothing brand with the optimistic idea to start a new kind of market for fashion. Influenced by #hashtagactivism, we will:
Represent products that promote awareness on social issues in 'Merica.
With each purchase, monetary support will be given to those who are active in the community and are working to relieve the issues at hand.
This isn't new news. Clothing and apparel companies have started supporting causes more regularly. However, many times, the company dedicates all efforts to one cause or a series of relatable causes. This is where We will expand. Why give all the attention to one matter when there are many out there that need addressing? Why not house all social causes under one label? The two connections each issue will have to each other are that they are issues brought to matter by society, and that they are happening right here in 'Merica.  
How We Can Reach Multiple Issues  Our strategy is to launch a series of product campaigns. Each campaign will offer a fresh design that relates to a social issue. During the lifespan of the campaign:
We will help increase public awareness
Make monetary contributions to the organizations that show the most success in research or in methods of resolving the issue.
So basically, the more products we sell within a campaign, the more funds we can provide to each organization. 
 We Need Support!Some people who are interested simply can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help! Not only do we need monetary support, but we also need a pay-it-forward kind-of-support:

Founded in 1955, the small family-run tannery uses traditional tanning methods to produce vegetable tanned leather desired by some of Italy’s largest luxury brands.   
Organic vegetable tanned leather from a small family-owned tannery in Tuscany, Italy that develops a rich patina over time.
Scandinavian minimalist front pocket wallet designs that fit seamlessly in your pocket without bulking up.  
Handmade in small batches using strong core spun stitching that holds up to wear and tear. 
RFID-blocking pockets to shield your cards from skimming & demagnetization
Maurizio’s Tannery  This small family run tannery opened in 1955 in the heart of the vegetable tanning district of Tuscany, Italy making it one of the oldes tanneries in the district.While many of the larger surrounding tanneries have been purchased by larger conglomorates, Maurizio has kept his in the family, keeping it small and constantly refining the vegetable tanned leather which he keeps making in small batches. In the tannery, making a single skin takes 6 weeks!The process to produce the Tuscany vegetable tanned leather is painstaking and long and has been used for centuries to create beautiful leather out of animal hides. Most importantly, it doesn’t use any harmful chemicals in the tanning process. The exact tannin composition is a well kept family secret.The author (to the right) at the tannery.The full process, to make a single skin, takes 6 weeks and is largely done by hand. Maurizio’s exact tannin composition is still a well kept family secret. His leather is desired by some of the biggest fashion brands in Italy, keeping the tannery alive and well for the ages. We are proud to state that this is the leather we have used to create Axess Wallets.Inspired by Scandinavian Minimalist DesignSweden is commonly regarded as embodying all that is great about Scandinavian design with its minimalist ideas of using clean, simple lines and a strong emphasis on functionality and that is also the heritage from which the design of Axess Wallets originated from. Scandinavian design is a design movement characterized by simplicity, minimalism and functionality which is embodied in each wallet. Handmade & RFID-blockingEach wallet is carefully handmade using strong core spun stitching which holds up well to wear and tear and the pockets are designed to withstand daily use. For added functionality, each wallet has one (or in the V-shaped wallet, two) RFID-blocking pockets to protect your sensitive cards from wireless skimming.What's new?Due to quality control issues in the past, in this iteration of Axess Wallets we have redesigned the pockets of each model to make for a more sturdy design that holds up better to wear and tear and keeps the inner lining intact.Instead of the previous small holes in the credit card slots, we now use full separate strip type slots which have a much increased durability.In addition to redesigning all card slots we have also developed a completely new model, the 'Essential' - Key wallet.Why we need backersTo continue developing Axess we offer the wallets at a 33% lower price from their regular prices to buy leather from the tannery, which is sold in large Minimum Order Quantities so that we can keep making the wallets in a larger scale in our 7 colors and leathers.________________________Essential - Key WalletPerfect for a night out or as a daily minimalist all-in-one wallet.

<p>About 3 years ago I decided to quit my current position, i was many years in food business, living and working at Scandinavia, last years i was CEO of company at Iceland.

<p>We are beginners on Indiegogo, but we are already 3 years on the market boulding our cooperation with boutiques in Poland but as well multinations sales. We are aware our project is complex and that there are always unforeseen issues, but we have anticipated and planned for potential risks and have built a rock-solid production and delivery plan.</p>
<p>Firstly, our production is quite advanced and you can be very confident about our capacity to provide high-quality products on time. We spent over 1 year designing, developing, and receiving finalized samples.</p>
<p>Secondly, we have very skillful and professional suppliers and do not anticipate delays to our timeline. However, if by chance anything unexpected happens, we promise to keep you informed, both during the campaign and afterwards.</p>
<p><strong>FAQ </strong></p>
<p>The movement: When do I need to change the battery? NEVER! The watch has a mechanical movement that is powered by you.</p>
<p>The movement: Why did you decide on Japanese movements for the Balticus Bronze Divers? Well, the Japanese movements are just as reliable as any ETA movement - if not even more reliable! If we did use an ETA movement the watch would have almost doubled the final cost of the product. We are using Miyota movements at almost all our watches available already on the market.</p>
<p>When will my card be charged? If you’re new to Indiegogo this might be confusing to you but here all cards will be charged as soon as the campaign has been officially funded and the time has ran out on the campaign. You should see a charge on your account 3-5 days after the campaign ends - EDITED - IT LOOKS LIKE INDIEGOGO IS CHARGING CARDS RIGHT AFTER BACKING.</p>
<p>How long will my watch be warranted? We will work with all customers case by case but all watch movements will be insured for up to a year after the campaign ends. We cannot warrant customers who break their watches due to wear and tear.</p>

It was very long trip to start this campaign, many of you was already doubt that this project will start, but finally. I was very busy with bouilding sales and relationship with butiques owners in Poland, now i have position strong enough to start new projects, new opportunities, and to start this fantastic Bronze Divers!
Im not going to tell you any strange stories how my grand grand father was a watch maker and when i was a kid there was always watches around me, NO WAY. Im driving honest, transparent and clear business. There is NO history of watchmaking behind me, im passionate and big fan of watches.

About 3 years ago I decided to quit my current position, i was many years in food business, living and working at Scandinavia, last years i was CEO of company at Iceland. Finally came TIME for changes, TIME for coming back to family and to Poland, but came as well TIME to find new activity which i could be in. To keep multinational activity, to conect it with my passion, hobby. Decided to go into watches :)

Im from north of Poland so naturally i was thinking about making watch brand calls BALTICUS or something connected with Baltic Sea, my first watch model calls Grey Seal as seals are reborn at Baltic sea more and more, second model is Star Dust and Black Dust with lovely blue marble dial. I have been producing watches for Facebook Groups, now im working at project for Mustang Club Poland with young but well known designer but also trying to develop new models for Balticus regular offer. Watches are produced in Hong Kong, but assembling will be in Poland and that's why on dial will stand - Made in Poland.

Now its time to offer special watches, Balticus in Bronze cases and YES bronze case will get patine! But if you dont like patine, you can easly clean it.
There will be 2 x 250 pcs of numbered watches. All of them will have special indyvidual number, this watches will not be available later, only this 250pcs of each model!
Campaign is simple, no tricks, no hidden goals thats why you can choose from 2 PERKS and only one is additional as Super Early Birds who are willing to save some $$$$. Look at pictures, they will tell you about our quality - polished and brushed case and outer bezel parts, embossed steel back case, detailed dials, well sized compressor look case with two crowns. We are offering as well very unique leather strap with ridges with butterfly buckle.

First model, Big Wave is fully inspired by ""Great Wave off Kanagawa"", this watch is a tributte to Japan art and culture. Of course watch is powered by Japan automatic movement Miyota 9015 which is perfect and superior quality. Big Wave watch is limited and numbered, only 250 pcs will be produced! No more!

Wave is as well embossed on back, we have focused on detals, you can see wild waves, so natural so unpredictable......... As You can see, back is made of steel, so will not get patine and will not leave any signs of dirt at your wrist!
Dial is with awesome lume, large rouge wave, but as well indexs and markers, all of this is giving special feelings, special look. For sure none of other watches can offer this.

Second model it's Balticus Grey Seal, which dial is inspired by Seals skin, from dark grey colour on top to almost white on bottom part. Watch is as well powered by Miyota 9015 and as well limited to 250pcs.

Embossed seal on back is a detail which you will like and love, it will catch an attention, you can not find it on common watches. And as well You can see, back is made of steel, so will not get patine and will not leave any signs of dirt at your wrist! I'm realy focusing on details, it's part of my passion.

Key features of this limited watches:
- Japan automatic movement Miyota 9015
- case made of CuSn6 marine grade bronze
- case size 44x51mm, normaly lenght is about 54mm, but this case is bit shorter to fit better on wrist, you can't feel its big watch, additionally thicknes is about 12-13mm

<p>What good is it if we sell you a frame that doesn’t fit, or a frame that doesn’t suit your face shape and what if you don’t have your PD?</p>
<p><strong>“Facial Fit”</strong> was created to solve those very problems. Taking your PD is now possible through our proprietary Facial Fit app.</p>
<p>One of the most important measurements to make sure that your glasses will fit is your head width. The Facial Fit app it will give you your head width, bridge width and PD measurement, it will also tell you your face shape.</p>
<p>All London Jones eyeglasses give you the frame width measurement (head width), bridge width measurement and a face shape recommendation.</p>
<p>To ensure properly fitting eyeglasses your head width and the frame width should be within + or - 4mm and the bridge width should be within + or - 2mm.</p>

<p>If we want to push innovation we must start with a ""what if"" mindset. This approach allows us to imagine eyewear designs in an unhindered way.  Several designs are created and modified until the final product is sent to the factory for production.</p>
<p>Form is function. The principles of modern industrial design perfectly applies to London Jones eyewear: it is engineered to guarantee a unique combination of aesthetics and precise fit.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Colors are selected and blended, prototypes are made. The designs spring to life. Each frame is manufactured with great attention to detail, the frame front is critical in supporting prescription lenses, all London Jones frames must be comfortable to wear, while being a compliment to your individual style.</p>
<p>We use only 100% ECO plastics - because every small step matters!</p>

Therefore, the sterilization function of silver itself will not disappear.*Extra Length Option is not available for size XS and S.",30.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Saturn is named after the famous rocket booster series that carried 24 men to the moon during its use. This watch will be part of a limited run of 1,969 pieces, honouring 50 years since 1969 and the first of the moon landings. Saturn's dial is made entirely of the recovered AS-203 metal, with a darkened tint, almost resembling the surface of the moon itself. The dial maintains the rough and raw texture of the metal, giving a true sense of the adventure that this metal has been on since 1966.</p>

<h3><strong>Authentication of the Metal</strong></h3>
<p>After extensive research and testing since 2005, West One has been able to put together an extensive archive of information on the AS-203 and the panel that we recovered in Zambia.

<h3><strong>Our Goal &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>For this project to go ahead, we need to raise $45,000. This will allow us to commence production, starting with prototypes. We expect to deliver the watches to early buyers by June 2020 but we hope to beat that schedule.</p>
<p>Our funding goal is fixed, so if we don't reach it, your money is refunded to you and the project will not go ahead.

<p><strong>Why is this important to us?</strong></p>
<p>Interest in space exploration and what is beyond our world has been carried through three generations of our family and continues to ignite our imaginations. We are incredibly passionate about this project and have wanted to do it for a long time, so to see our hard work pay off would be a dream come true and a fitting way to honour the legacy of Graham.</p>
<p>The Apollo Watch Collection is the culmination of a story that has been part of our family through three generations, starting in 1975. Starting with Graham, there has always been a great interest in space and aviation for those in our family.  To be part of a project this exciting is an honour that we want to share with other individuals that are likeminded in their interest in space exploration and its history.</p>
<p>We hope that by buying your own watch, you can become a part of this story and help us celebrate human endeavour and space exploration; both in the past and in the future.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3> </h3>
</div><p> </p><p> </p></div>","The Watches
Apollo Watch Collection launches with 3 distinct, Swiss-Made watches; Eagle, Saturn and Orion. Each model will have a dial made entirely of the recovered AS-203 metal. This dial will include a moon phase function, showing its owner the position of the moon through its 29.5 day cycle, as well as luminous hands, numbers and indexes. You can purchase the full collection in a special presentation box, or buy them individually.
Once the campaign has been fully funded, our website will go live and buyers will be able to select their serial numbers.

The Movement
Eagle, Saturn and Orion will use the Sellita Caliber SW280. This bespoke caliber is a self winding, automatic movement with 26 jewels and a 38 hour power reserve.


 
Eagle
 

Eagle was inspired by the Eagle Lunar Module and will be limited to 500 pieces. This special watch will include unique features, such as what we call the 'port-hole', allowing its owner to look out to the moon-phase. Other unique features include the date and time that the AS-203 rocket launched, printed on the dial that is made solely from the recovered AS-203 metal, as well as a limited edition strap that will only be available as an option to owners of Eagle.
Eagle is the ultimate collectors item, with only 500 pieces, it is the most limited in the Apollo Watch Collection, with pricing that is almost too good to be true. Almost!
See the images below for a better look at Eagle and the detailed specifications for this watch.




 
Saturn
 

Saturn is named after the famous rocket booster series that carried 24 men to the moon during its use. This watch will be part of a limited run of 1,969 pieces, honouring 50 years since 1969 and the first of the moon landings.

The dial maintains the rough and raw texture of the metal, giving a true sense of the adventure that this metal has been on since 1966.

Orion
 

Orion takes its name from the world-famous constellation, visible in the night sky from everywhere on the globe. Like Saturn, Orion will be part of a limited run of 1,969 pieces, celebrating the 50th anniversary of the first moon landing.
Orion is the perfect embodiment of human endeavour, displaying the metal in its true form, without any changes in colour or texture. Each dial in this collection will be completely individual, taken from different parts of the recovered AS-203 rocket, offering its owner the chance to own a watch that is unique to any other.

Our team worked day and night for six months, starting from scratch to every detail. We felt we were closer from our dream to reality day by day… but at the end, there is a thousand dreams from all over the world. and only one can be chosen.Of cause, we were not that lucky.Till one day we saw a rendering of our own art works displayed in this Avantgarde museum, suddenly, we feel so released about the result. At least, our six months effort are not in vain. After second thought, why not we can use this design to create a virtual art museum.ground floor plan of SITONCLOUD ART MUSEUMThis is how we came up with this idea of using an real architectural plan to build up a virtual art museum, and we named it “SITONCLOUD”. This museum will exist immortally in the digital cloud.The only criteria for selections of artists is their passion for art. we would like to dedicate this museum to all the artists who share their art inspirations to us.Even curating is virtual, we (architect) want everything to be perfect. We made each exhibition a post. We allocate each exhibition in a specific room. We set up each day as a sunny day. And the milky sun light diffuse into our exhibition room, and gently cover our art works. They are respected as if they are in the best museum in the world.micro exhibition #01 in SITONCLOUD ART MUSEUM EXHIBITION  Many languages do not distinguish between what in English are described as ""blue"" and ""green"". They instead use a cover term spanning both. When the issue is discussed in linguistics, this cover term is sometimes called “grue” in English. By coincident, when you are looking at both his photography and his presentation of his architecture works, “grue” is best hue to describe his observations from his eyes. Uncompromising like his architecture pursuit, “if there is no green, then there is no blue”. His pictures look pure in one sight, but much more saturation in spaces at second glaze.   ARTISTHOU LiangChinese Born Belgian Architect HOU Liang started his own practice since 2005, after his award-winning proposal for worldwide architecture competition for Tsunami Memorial in Thailand. He and his team win numerous important international architecture competitions, including Seoul Performing art center in Korea, Jean Paul II memorial museum in Poland. For more than ten years he is not only being active in Avant-guard architectural design, but also being experimental in multimedia design. His projection mapping on 3-dimensional white furniture tables called ""sitoncloud"" project has become an iconic design for the new generation, and was exhibited in Museum of Modern Art in Paris in 2012. ""Tsunami Memorial"" in Thailand, you can find more about Hou Liang Architecture @ www.houliang.com ""Grand Canyon “dining table, you can find more about SITONCLOUD project @ www.sitoncloud.com MUSEUM SHOPSo far it comes to the museum economy, we have our own online museum shop.

<p><strong style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Problem 1</strong></p>
</div>
<ul>
<li> In combination with daily tasks and body use, damage to muscles and skeleton is frequent consequence of carrying heavy bags, backpacks and occupational gear</li>
<li>New research confirms that nerves that travel through the neck and shoulders are also at serious risk</li>
<li>Children in their developing years should be more protected and considered not to carry heavy bags </li>
</ul>
<p>In past years, even with digitalisation, there are no solutions from schools or educational departments for this worldwide problem, that could be available to most of population. Same issue is actually very different from each schools, institutions or individuals involved. We all need to start considering importance and wellbeing of our body and respect it from early ages.</p>

<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>We need support of 30,000 USD for materials, definition and production of  personal components such as buttons and clips, prints, braille label-prints, custom-made bands, sample definition for production and production start.</p>
<p>All materials are made in Italy with sustainable productions and certifications COEX®, OEKO Tex® or GOTS ®. Our initial production is planned for 1500 pieces divided differently per model of bags. </p>
<p>PURPOSE BAG is recyclable,  reusable, repairable and once you'll try it,  you'll use it in your every day journey. PURPOSE BAG has simple but innovative functionality, minimalist aspect and great comfort so after you feel it no bag will be the same again.</p>

<p><b>More Benefits with design</b></p>
<p>       Each piece will be visually unique; based on material choice production and print even when produced in series.That is, in part,  also because Washable paper material as cellulose-based fibre, is produced using traditional techniques that consist in handmade embossing and colouring of each single sheet.In that case it is not possible to have or to guarantee identical material sheet in colour and overall appearance.</p>
<p>COMFORT WITH lightness is all... with respect for your body and muscles :)</p>
<p>Over a lifetime, usage of reusable bags by one of us, would save world from approx 22,000 plastic bags (cc.a 12,000 USD)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE IMPACT </strong></p>
<p>Awareness of product utility, material type and production  is necessary for all of us. If we can’ t recycle, reuse, repair or compost any product then we should also think about producing it. <strong>PURPOSE BAG</strong> is considered project with impact and social inclusion as building new communities. We will collaborate with medium large productions and worldwide distribution will be equally covered from all producers. Production is situated in Europe from manufactures in Italy, France, Germany, Portugal and Spain.</p>

Our everyday inspiration is that design & fashion products must be created for comfort and service to those who use them.
 

 
We have  mission to support sustainable life. so we created light bag for every day challenges that you could have,  and use this lightness also for better impact on our environment.
Purpose bag inspiration was mentioned, so our challenge is to resolve some problematic facts that are part of worldwide statistics where we would like to help and start finding new innovative solutions:
Problem 1


 In combination with daily tasks and body use, damage to muscles and skeleton is frequent consequence of carrying heavy bags, backpacks and occupational gear
New research confirms that nerves that travel through the neck and shoulders are also at serious risk
Children in their developing years should be more protected and considered not to carry heavy bags 

In past years, even with digitalisation, there are no solutions from schools or educational departments for this worldwide problem, that could be available to most of population. Same issue is actually very different from each schools, institutions or individuals involved. We all need to start considering importance and wellbeing of our body and respect it from early ages.

                                                     
                                                                  
Problem 2

A person use a plastic carrier bag on average for only 12 minutes and the question is why use something for 12 minutes and then throw it away?
 The average family accumulates 60 plastic bags in only 4 trips to the grocery store 
Approximately we recycle only 1 plastic bag in every 200 we use 
We are now producing nearly 300 million tons of plastic every year, half of which disposable
More than 8 million tons of plastic is dumped into our oceans every year.

             

let's get familiar with... 

 
...and make it lighter with use of PURPOSE BAG that is made to serve you.

What We Need & What You Get

We need support of 30,000 USD for materials, definition and production of  personal components such as buttons and clips, prints, braille label-prints, custom-made bands, sample definition for production and production start.
All materials are made in Italy with sustainable productions and certifications COEX®, OEKO Tex® or GOTS ®. Our initial production is planned for 1500 pieces divided differently per model of bags. 
PURPOSE BAG is recyclable,  reusable, repairable and once you'll try it,  you'll use it in your every day journey. PURPOSE BAG has simple but innovative functionality, minimalist aspect and great comfort so after you feel it no bag will be the same again.
Additional shoulder straps, included in collection, are wearable and adaptable on any other bag. We keep it simple and light and you will gain in fun and personal styling by your choice.
WASHABLE PAPER sample of textures and colours

More Benefits with design
       Each piece will be visually unique; based on material choice production and print even when produced in series.That is, in part,  also because Washable paper material as cellulose-based fibre, is produced using traditional techniques that consist in handmade embossing and colouring of each single sheet.In that case it is not possible to have or to guarantee identical material sheet in colour and overall appearance.
COMFORT WITH lightness is all... with respect for your body and muscles :)
Over a lifetime, usage of reusable bags by one of us, would save world from approx 22,000 plastic bags (cc.a 12,000 USD)
 
THE IMPACT 
Awareness of product utility, material type and production  is necessary for all of us. If we can’ t recycle, reuse, repair or compost any product then we should also think about producing it. PURPOSE BAG is considered project with impact and social inclusion as building new communities. We will collaborate with medium large productions and worldwide distribution will be equally covered from all producers. Production is situated in Europe from manufactures in Italy, France, Germany, Portugal and Spain.
 
 

 
Labels and logo design are double printed, which means printed also in Braille. 
We are looking for collaborations and knowledge of different communities in all countries such as braille users, sustainable producers, change makers, marketers and all creative individuals with desire to co-create and expand lightness of PURPOSE BAG.
In that way PURPOSE BAG could have desired impact of elevating and improving each person life. To understand others necessity,  we need collaborations and communication so we can support and sustain together our individuality.


Our collaboration is focused on production studios or small manufacturers that are developing innovative and inclusive projects within communities. All teams or individuals that like design, innovation, evolution and care for social impact and equality matter are welcome to join us.
 We need more inclusion of design in every day life to create innovative sustainable products with sustainable production for better sustainable world.
 In first production we plan to giveaway 600 shoulder straps to non-profit organisations, schools or institutions that are devoted to improve, include and help community life in need.Please let us know in comments, or by sending us an e-mail, with  your ideas and your preferences for non -profit organisations that are working on improvement and care for others in sustainable way . We will include them on our list for giveaways.
In that way  we will reach more people and make their day ""lighter"" with all they need to carry on.
 
         

 
Risks & Challenges
Risk and challenges in fashion production procedure are not so common. We have intention to produce in countries with highly skilled  manufacturers and have great experience in fashion production.For now production countries as already mentioned are Italy, France, Spain, Portugal and Germany. If any technical problems in production occurs, will be resolved by highly skilled teams. Contractors will be  supported thru production and if there might be  other, different challenges we have skills to resolve problems in shortest time possible. 
Our transparency policy and communication will be maintained true whole production and distribution till final delivery process.

<p>Hello All!  I'm Jen, a freelance artist, and aspiring comic book/webcomic creator!  I am currently working on releasing my first ever webcomic, but in-between that, I have other creative flights of fancy, and one of those is why I bring you here today!  But more on that in a moment.  First, I'd like to help you all get to know the person behind the campaign a little more.  As I said, I'm an artist.  It's basically part of my DNA at this point, because I've been drawing ever since I could hold a pencil!  I love experimenting with new and different forms of art, but my ""go-to"" for a long time has been digital art.  I think what draws ( ;) ) me to it the most is that I love how I can make images/characters/etc. that look like they stepped right out of an animation.  Along with art, I've always loved watching cartoons, and still do to this day!  And I've also become an avid anime fan, so that has definitely had an influence in my work.  As an artist, I've definitely had my ups and downs, art blocks, or ""creative hybernations"", lack of time due to other life duties, and of course trying to be the best mom I can be to my 4 children.  Now I really want to dive headfirst into letting my art not only be a creative outlet for me, but also try and garner a return on my lifelong investment in it by trying to make a little money off of it.  Get my art to work for me, you know.  That's where I hope you all will come in and help support my little project (and maybe others in the future!).</p>
<p>I'm starting this project because I would like to make T-Shirts of my ""Mind Filleter"" design.  If this project goes well, I would also like to try and make other items too, such as aprons, hoodies, enamel pins, stickers, magnets, and more!  But before I can do that, I need the startup costs to cover the cost of the tees (and possibly other items).  This will be my first ever fundraising campaign, so I would really love some help getting my project off the ground!  And you'd get to look stylish in the process!  The plan is to do a 50/50 soft blend tee in a variety of sizes (prioritizing backer sizes of course), and if I exceed my goal, I'll make some more goodies for you all! </p>
<p><strong>Campaign</strong></p>
<p>I am trying to raise $2500 for the initial cost of the T-Shirt run.  The funding will be going towards manufacturing costs of the T-Shirts and then shipping costs to get them to you, as well as the manufacturing of an inventory for me to have on hand to sell in the future.  The perks you will get with your donation will vary depending on what you choose, but if I make my original $2500 goal, I will then open up a goal to also add ""Mind Filleter"" aprons to the mix!  Main perks will be a ""Mind Filleter"" T-Shirt in whichever size the backer specifies.  Other possible perks are Enamel Pins, Stickers, Magnets, and Static Clings. </p>
<p>If I do not reach my goal, I have my campaign set up as ""all or nothing"" so all backers will be refunded their pledges should I not meet my goal.</p>
<p>I believe this campaign has value, if for nothing else, by bringing a smile to the people who would wear the T-Shirts, and perhaps those who see them wearing them.  I love seeing ""nerd culture"" gaining more and more popularity and I would love to help be a part of the expansion.  </p>
<p><strong>Risks and Challenges:</strong></p>
<p>I don't foresee too many challenges ahead, because the design is already completed, I just need to choose which manufacturer I'd like to work with and ensure the design prints properly.  A possible hurdle would be an extended manufacturing time if the manufacturer needs to remake any portion of the order due to color or quality issues.  There will also be time needed for quality control, as I plan to inspect each shirt to my own standards before shipping them out to their new owners.  As for shipping, I plan to use USPS flat rate boxes, and shipping charges will be separate from the pledges.  I will send out tracking information to backers once items have shipped out.  If there are any delays due to production, quality control, or shipping, I will do my absolute best to inform all backers of any such information in a timely manner.</p>
<p><strong>What else you can do</strong></p>
<p>If you can't currently back my campaign, but still want to help me out, please feel free to share this will all of your friends, plaster it in your social media, tweet about it, tag me in your instagram, the works!  I appreciate any and all signal boosts you can give me! </p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Nitty-Gritty on our fabric.</h3>
<p>We are utilizing Eco-Circle Polyester that comes from old garments instead of plastic bottles like most “ethical” companies use. This material uses 56% of the energy output to make as regular poly and has about 7/8 savings in greenhouse gas offput.

</div></div>","AS SEEN IN

______________________________________________________ It shouldn't be a hassle to find well-fitting activewear, but for many guys who fall in-between sizes, it is.Seifer approaches design with a piece-by-piece mentality that began with making an entirely new size scale to take height and body type into account: Slim, Athletic, and Democratic for build. Short, Medium, Tall for height. In total, we have 9 sizes. Each is a combination of Build and Height. 
Along the way, we are taking a stand against brands that focus on profits without consideration for quality, fair working  conditions, or the environment.Our fabric is sustainably made and our factories treat their employees with respect and pay them fair wages for fair work. We couldn't find a fabric that met our high standards, so we decided to develop our own.This revolutionary fabric uses a blended yarn of 92% Recycled Polyester and 8% Tencel, but this isn't any normal Recycled Polyester.Our experience leading technical fabric research and development at a large sportswear company in Los Angeles enabled the development of this new textile. It has a pretty remarkable backstory, and is certified by multiple international standards organizations.Plus, it's completely and permanently odor-resistant. No more post-gym stench. Ever. 
Our Design is Made for Movement.Our shirt features a subtly scalloped hemline, raglan shoulders for flexibility and motion, and flatlocked seaming throughout. Slim, without being overly restricting – it's the type of shirt that makes you look and perform your best, while feeling like you're wearing your favorite t-shirt (if your favorite shirt resisted odor and microbial growth while being comfortable and breathable. 
Proudly Made-in-the-USA by one of the best factories in Southern California, our revolutionary fabric has the following certifications.           By being online only, we will eliminate brick-and-mortar expenses and pass these savings on to you, so it's easier than ever to buy well-made, well-fitting clothing that matches your values and your wallet.  Why Athletic Clothing?Right now, there are two options for guys when it comes to athletic clothing:Price or Quality. Consumer-sensitive workout brands offer a great price, but usually have low quality fabrics, poor fit, and a questionable supply chain. (They don't get those prices through 'magic')At the other end of the spectrum, the higher-end, so-called ""Active Lifestyle"" brands offer quality goods with high-tech fabrics and a matching premium price increase. More often than not, this is little more than a façade where they tend to use the same unsustainable practices as the lower-cost brands and don't truly innovate on fabrics, fit, or watching their supply chain closely.In both cases, the end result is consistently sold for more than five times the manufacturing cost, and they all use an outdated approach to fit (s-xl) that leaves many of us in-between sizes. Both low-cost and high-quality brands tend to ignore the full supply chain they use and shoot for low manufacturing costs above all.   Seifer hopes to inspire the necessary changes in the apparel industry while empowering guys to pursue their best selves everyday.  
We're starting out with the Perfect Black workout shirt, but this is only the beginning.
If we reach our stretch goals of $50,000 and $75,000, we'll offer Navy and Pine into the mix.
Any money raised above our initial needs for production will go right back into developing top-tier products with a fair supply chain and a price we can all agree on.
Available Colors:


How Your Money Will Be Used.
We've spent $3,000 out-of-pocket in product development to get Seifer to this point.  
However, as a new retail business, there are minimum order quantities that must be placed when developing new fabrics and manufacturing in the USA (it's not easy being a small fish in a big pond).
If our fundraising goal is hit, your money will go directly into the production and manufacturing of the first Seifer product, with profits going towards developing the brand and expanding the line. 
 


 
The Nitty-Gritty on our fabric.
We are utilizing Eco-Circle Polyester that comes from old garments instead of plastic bottles like most “ethical” companies use. This material uses 56% of the energy output to make as regular poly and has about 7/8 savings in greenhouse gas offput. Polyester is great as an athletic fiber because it is very strong, can stretch a little bit without breaking, and can be dyed both in yarn stage or in garment stage. 

Tencel is added for a natural feel and an anti-microbial finish that can last for the entire lifetime of the garment. It's made from biodegradable, renewable, sustainably harvested eucalyptus wood pulp. It also happens to be comfortable, lightweight and known for its ability to be grown on low-grade land. Its production uses 80% less water than cotton, and is developed in a closed loop system, which only uses recycled water.
The fabric is finished with Polygiene, a powerful odor and microbe fighter that is bound into the fibers in the shirt. It will never wash out, ensuring the garment is capable and fresh for years to come. 
 
 
Our recycled fabric is certified Standard 100 by Oeko-Tex, the go-to authority for fabric testing and regulating harmful substances. They make sure every fabric’s origin and contents are totally up front for the consumer. Learn more about  Oeko-Tex 100.
We are also Intertek certified. All manufacturers who become partners with Intertek agree to a rigorous testing process to look for anything from banned colorants to heavy metal, pesticide, or fungicide residue. Learn more about Intertek.

<h3>Our Passion</h3>
<p>Why do we have a passion to help these women? Our CEO Elizabeth Salaman and her sister Sara are from rural Colombia. They know first hand the struggles these women have. It's the world they know. To now have the opportunity to help women in these areas is a privilege. We have been able to do this since 2009, but now we want to do so much more. Check out our full story video here: </p>

<h3><strong>Our Mission</strong></h3>
</div></div>
<p>The root of poverty in rural areas around the nature reserves in Colombia is the lack of work opportunities for women. Many families are unable to support their children’s education causing a continuation of the poverty cycle. Our mission is to break that cycle through providing training and employment for women in these areas to make beautiful jewellery using sustainable materials for the Picaflor brand, and sustain a new cycle of provision for their generation, and generations to come.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Life Changing</strong></h3>
<p>This campaign would literally change lives. So far the Picaflor project has been able to help and provide employment for 20 women. We want to impact the lives of many, many more women and a successful campaign would enable that to happen.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>With additional funding we will be able to provide training and employment for more women in rural areas of Colombia. We are aiming to raise $40,000. That would enable us to double our existing number of employees to 40 women within the next 12 months. We would also invest in marketing and aim to create a global brand for the Picaflor collection of jewellery. The funding would provide us with the ability to buy higher volumes of raw materials, packaging and also tooling.</p>
<p>Your investment in our campaign is THE ONLY way to get your hands on these beautiful pieces of handmade jewellery. They are all made from seeds that come from the Colombian Rainforest, and no piece is exactly the same.</p>

<p>Let’s face it: most shoes are specialized. You can buy a lifestyle shoe and wear it out on the town… but you can’t go hiking in it; or you can buy an athletic shoe, but it’s usually only good for one sport; and when you do finally find a cross-training shoe that matches a general movement feel, it’s probably designed by a big company that has purposely given it a crazy color scheme so you have to buy matching clothing to go along with it. How come no one just creates awesome shoes that are versatile and match with everything? Well, that’s where the Stealth Ultra comes in.</p>

</div><div>
<p>We designed this shoe for people from all walks of life. That’s because a) we love people!! And b) That is us – we come from all walks of life! For the people, by the people – that’s how we view what we do.</p>
<p>Whether you are a focused athlete, someone who trains casually, a Ninja Warrior fanatic, an artists, a creator, a student, a dreamer, a visionary, someone who loves Star Wars or video games or someone who just wants an ultra comfortable shoe to wear on the daily, we made the Stealth Ultra for you. Really :-)</p>

<p>We have designed the Stealth Ultra to be your go-to shoe no matter the occasion. “Training. Movement. Life.” Is the mantra. For that we needed a true lifestyle feel accompanied by incredible performance capabilities, great durability, and insane comfort through and through. We think from the first time you put on the shoe you’ll feel the Take Flight difference.</p>

<div>We designed this shoe with a true-to-fit sizing that mirrors most large shoe brands. We’ve found that half sizes are pretty redundant with only 4mm of difference between them. Because of this, we are making only full sizes. Our promise is, the shoes will fit great! And if they don’t? We will replace them free of charge : ) Plus when the time comes to choose your size, we’ll help you if you have any questions to make sure you get the right shoe the first time.</div>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>This is our 3rd shoe, and by now we are really comfortable making shoes. There are always challenges with production, logistics, and other aspects, so we've assembled a great team that can overcome just about anything. We have a great factory partner and we have a team on the ground via a fantastic sourcing agent. If there are any setbacks of any kind, we will keep our backers fully informed. We stand behind these shoes 100%, so if you pledge for a pair of shoes, then you can sit back and relax. We’ll be doing all the lifting to make sure a fresh pair of kicks arrives at your doorstep in no time : )</p>

</div></div>","Let’s face it: most shoes are specialized. You can buy a lifestyle shoe and wear it out on the town… but you can’t go hiking in it; or you can buy an athletic shoe, but it’s usually only good for one sport; and when you do finally find a cross-training shoe that matches a general movement feel, it’s probably designed by a big company that has purposely given it a crazy color scheme so you have to buy matching clothing to go along with it. How come no one just creates awesome shoes that are versatile and match with everything? Well, that’s where the Stealth Ultra comes in.

 


We designed this shoe for people from all walks of life. That’s because a) we love people!! And b) That is us – we come from all walks of life! For the people, by the people – that’s how we view what we do.
Whether you are a focused athlete, someone who trains casually, a Ninja Warrior fanatic, an artists, a creator, a student, a dreamer, a visionary, someone who loves Star Wars or video games or someone who just wants an ultra comfortable shoe to wear on the daily, we made the Stealth Ultra for you. Really :-)


We have designed the Stealth Ultra to be your go-to shoe no matter the occasion. “Training. Movement. Life.” Is the mantra. For that we needed a true lifestyle feel accompanied by incredible performance capabilities, great durability, and insane comfort through and through. We think from the first time you put on the shoe you’ll feel the Take Flight difference.

This video will give you a great look at the shoe so you can see the features for yourself.
 


 


 
We designed this shoe with a true-to-fit sizing that mirrors most large shoe brands. We’ve found that half sizes are pretty redundant with only 4mm of difference between them. Because of this, we are making only full sizes. Our promise is, the shoes will fit great! And if they don’t? We will replace them free of charge : ) Plus when the time comes to choose your size, we’ll help you if you have any questions to make sure you get the right shoe the first time.
 

 

 
We might be a bit old-fashioned but we believe in doing things the right way, and that means putting the customer first. In that way, we stand behind this shoe 100%. We’ve tested this shoe, we love it, and so we promise is you will love it too. And if you don’t? Well then we’ll give you your money back, no questions asked : )

 


For pledging to our campaign we have a few great rewards to offer: from simply being one of the first to wear this shoe and receiving a big discount; to having us teach a Parkour/Freerunning workshop in your town; to even receiving customized shoes! What we aspire to bring through our products is immense value to our customers (aka family), and when leveraged through this Kickstarter campaign, the value is even greater.

<h3>How it all started:</h3>
<p>It all started out of love and out of passion from the COMBINATO team.</p>
<p>They fell in love with leather because of its natural beauty. Out of their Love and Passion, this wonderful project was born, as well as the world first foldable handbag. </p>
<p>The leather is the epitome of elegance and it links us to our ancestral roots.</p>

<p>The inspiration for the handbag shape comes from the school lunch boxes which have a similar shape.</p>

They fell in love with leather because of its natural beauty. Out of their Love and Passion, this wonderful project was born, as well as the world first foldable handbag. 
The leather is the epitome of elegance and it links us to our ancestral roots.

The inspiration for the handbag shape comes from the school lunch boxes which have a similar shape.
 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Our Experience
The Combinato team has previous experience of producing and commercializing handmade leather shoes.

The COMBINATO team knows this industry and its challenges.
We have been working with well-known people in the Colombian Leather Industry for more than 30 years.

 
Our Contribution to the people 
In COMBINATO we are aware of the guerrilla war that Colombia has been through and the actual impact on the people who at one time were part of it.

For that reason, with your contribution to this project from a tweet to a monetary contribution, you can help create new jobs and make a difference.  You can help COMBINATO team bring them a new peaceful future.

<h3>THE SOLUTION</h3>
<p>To solve this problem, we've re-engineered the traditional dress shirt and created the Kuul Thread Shirt by utilizing fabric that absorbs, stores and releases heat for optimal thermal comfort. The Outlast® technology gives the ability to continually regulate skin's micro climate. As the skin gets hot, the heat is absorbed, and as it cools, that heat is released.</p>

The higher the object's temperature is, the more intensive is the infrared radiation which it releases.<br/>A test was done with a pair of gloves. One glove was equipped with and the other one without Outlast®material. A hand was then laid on an ice block for five minutes.

<h3><strong>It all started when…</strong></h3>
<p>I wanted to create a curated Collection of Beautiful Luxury Intimates. Intimisii is Love… Sensual… Alluring… The ambiguity that offers Mystery with a Hint of Transgression!</p>
<p>Intimisii is the ability to have an intimate relationship with Self… it is The Quintessential Timeless Classics that accentuates the very essence of your couture!</p>
<p>Every woman’s repertoire of intimates belongs to a special niché of seduction. Intimisii’s Luxury designed Chemises, Camisoles, Slips, Gowns, Kimonos, Baby Doll, Pajamas, Bottoms, and Sexy Tap Shorts are so ambiguous it can be worn both elegantly in the evening at the Opera or intimately alone in the boudoir.</p>
<h3>Intimisii... The Brand</h3>
<p>Intimisii’s ambitious and visionary mission is to Adorn you with meticulous, uncompromising Luxurious Silks &amp; Laces.</p>
<h3>and The Journey begins...</h3>
<p>Vanessa Muhammad, Founder &amp; CEO of Intimisii LLC is a thought leader and entrepreneur in the fashion industry. An alumnus at The University of Chicago School of Social Service Administration, I’ve always had a passion to empower people and inspire those around me to embrace their given beauty and walk in their purpose.</p>
<p>Ambitious and persistence are qualities I possess that helped me get to where I am today!  Lingerie isn't just for your significant other on anniversaries and holidays—more and more women are choosing to lounge around in their lingerie for the sake of self-love and self-care alone. It is so important that all women have access to clothing that makes them feel sensual and powerful.</p>
<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>However, as a plus-size curvaceous woman, luxury intimates are not readily available unless custom made, which is problematic. Therefore, many women are compelled to revert to less expensive fabrics that may look nice when purchased but lack the quality of a well-staple piece.</p>
<p>Mainstream fashion is focused on racy and trendy lingerie that excludes millions with different values. We believe every woman, regardless of size or faith, deserves access to fall in love with their body unapologetically! Intimisii wants to capture the Muslim and curvaceous silhouette.  As women, we share the same ideology when it comes to looking and feeling beautiful and sensual about ourselves, regardless if worn in the privacy of your boudoir.</p>
<h3>The Solution</h3>
<p>Intimisii bridges the gap between art and instrumentality. We pursue design with intent. We create Luxury Intimates for the woman who leaves you breathless when she walks in and steals your attention after she leaves.</p>
<p>We believe the future of Luxury Intimates depends on character fluidity and a willingness to accept change with ease. We believe that the Muslim woman, curvaceous woman, and mainstream fashion should represent similar adaptability composed of intimates as independent as they are uniquely complementary. Intimisii feels that societal runway standards should inspire all silhouettes to leave their mark amid constant evolution, lifestyles, size or faith.</p>

</div></div>","It all started when…
I wanted to create a curated Collection of Beautiful Luxury Intimates. Intimisii is Love… Sensual… Alluring… The ambiguity that offers Mystery with a Hint of Transgression!
Intimisii is the ability to have an intimate relationship with Self… it is The Quintessential Timeless Classics that accentuates the very essence of your couture!
Every woman’s repertoire of intimates belongs to a special niché of seduction. Intimisii’s Luxury designed Chemises, Camisoles, Slips, Gowns, Kimonos, Baby Doll, Pajamas, Bottoms, and Sexy Tap Shorts are so ambiguous it can be worn both elegantly in the evening at the Opera or intimately alone in the boudoir.
Intimisii... The Brand
Intimisii’s ambitious and visionary mission is to Adorn you with meticulous, uncompromising Luxurious Silks & Laces.
and The Journey begins...
Vanessa Muhammad, Founder & CEO of Intimisii LLC is a thought leader and entrepreneur in the fashion industry. An alumnus at The University of Chicago School of Social Service Administration, I’ve always had a passion to empower people and inspire those around me to embrace their given beauty and walk in their purpose.
Ambitious and persistence are qualities I possess that helped me get to where I am today!  Lingerie isn't just for your significant other on anniversaries and holidays—more and more women are choosing to lounge around in their lingerie for the sake of self-love and self-care alone. It is so important that all women have access to clothing that makes them feel sensual and powerful.
The Problem
However, as a plus-size curvaceous woman, luxury intimates are not readily available unless custom made, which is problematic. Therefore, many women are compelled to revert to less expensive fabrics that may look nice when purchased but lack the quality of a well-staple piece.
Mainstream fashion is focused on racy and trendy lingerie that excludes millions with different values. We believe every woman, regardless of size or faith, deserves access to fall in love with their body unapologetically! Intimisii wants to capture the Muslim and curvaceous silhouette.  As women, we share the same ideology when it comes to looking and feeling beautiful and sensual about ourselves, regardless if worn in the privacy of your boudoir.
The Solution
Intimisii bridges the gap between art and instrumentality. We pursue design with intent. We create Luxury Intimates for the woman who leaves you breathless when she walks in and steals your attention after she leaves.
We believe the future of Luxury Intimates depends on character fluidity and a willingness to accept change with ease. We believe that the Muslim woman, curvaceous woman, and mainstream fashion should represent similar adaptability composed of intimates as independent as they are uniquely complementary. Intimisii feels that societal runway standards should inspire all silhouettes to leave their mark amid constant evolution, lifestyles, size or faith.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This is now our third crowdfunding campaign, and we’ve learned tons from both of our previous highly successful campaigns.

<p>In any case, we’re fully ready to bring you the perfect personalized, one-of-a-kind dress shirt to your door by January 2020!</p>

So pre-order  your sunglasses now!        Our Walden style is named after the book by Henry David Thoreau, which reflects upon simple, environmentally healthy living in a woodland cabin. Our Muir style is named after John Muir, one of the first American environmentalists. Known as ""Muir of the Mountains"" and the ""Father of the national parks,"" he was an ecological hero. So, we named our most classic frame after him.   This frame colour represents our unique hemp material in all of its unfiltered glory. The plant fibres are left in their natural state with absolutely no colouring whatsoever.    Using naturally extracted organic dye, we’ve created a darker colour to give you a more classic option. These earthy frames are made from plants that are quite literally are grown in the earth. Natural hemp fibre specs are visible on the material surface which creates a look that we like to call “tortoise hemp’.  Deep blue colouring from eco dye is combined with our sustainable hemp technology to create this bold frame colour.  An earthy colour for natural eyewear and our classic lens.  This yellow tint is from a performance range of lens dyes. This particular shade was developed to help professional tennis players.  Floral vibes and crimson tones.  A gradient lens from pale grey to black.  A hemp fabric box, protective hemp pouch and microfibre cleaning cloth is included with every pair of sunglasses.  Everything about our eyewear is unconventional: the materials, the process, the design and the look. If you’re someone who sees things differently, this one’s for you.   We want the lifecycle of hemp to be as long as possible. Our two-year warranty covers damage and defects, and we’ll provide a replacement pair for frames that cannot be repaired.For as long as you have your sunglasses, we’ll do our best to repair your frames and keep them wearable for years to come, free of charge.  Most eyewear is mass-produced by machines in factories that use plastic as the main material.Plastic is terrible for the environment as it contributes to climate change and ocean pollution, not to mention every product looks exactly the same and lacks character. Hemp is the most sustainable, eco-friendly and diverse resources on earth — but not many know about it... and no... you can't smoke them.   It’s the most sustainable material on earth, and it also happens to be absolutely beautiful.  We decided to use hemp in developing the “world’s first” hemp eyewear, that’s better for the environment and acts as a talking point to raise awareness of hemp.   The plant’s fibres also create unique patterns, which makes each pair of sunglasses as individual as the person who wears them.  Nature has no straight lines.Our plant fibre material is unlike any plastic or wood grain, as the material is actually made up of thousands of individual plant fibres.   Our hardened frame material is formed by processing plant fibre into solid material.  It is comprised simply of hemp fibres and the right amount of water which reacts with the hemp as a binding agent, proving that we don’t have to use plastics for eyewear anymore.  All of our frames are crafted by hand using our sustainable technology, organic materials and traditional artisanal techniques. Every single screw, rivet and hinge is marked, drilled and assembled by a real human being, not a machine.GIFWe only use precision-engineered components made from the best materials — if it's not made from hemp, then it's made from the highest-grade titanium or alloy to guarantee long-lasting performance and quality.  Hemp Eyewear is not mass producing tens of thousands of frames through injection moulding plastic. There are no instances of mistreatment amongst our workers or mysteries surrounding any part of our production process.   Your nose will also thank you when wearing Hemp Eyewear. Even our nose pads are made from hemp for maximum comfort.  Have you ever been told you have a big head? We have. And we’ve accounted for the unfortunate people like us. Our high-grade nickel spring hinges allow anyone to wear our eyewear, no matter your head shape or size. Our eyewear is for those of you who like to stand out, for eccentric, characterful, contrarian individuals.   Protect the planet.. and your eyes. Our lenses protect you from 99-100% of UV light from the sun. So we've got you covered.",55.0,0,"3 Campaigns

So this is the right place to become one of the first people to own the Coffee Watch. We'll engrave the serial number on the case back to make your watch truely one-of-a-kind! What's more, by buying now on Indiegogo, you're guaranteed to get the Coffee Watch at a better rate than for the later retail price!  A TRUELY UNIQUE MATERIAL In Germany alone, more than 20 million tons of coffee grounds are collected every year. It would be a shame if they went to waste! Luckily, there are companies like Kaffeeform. Also from Berlin, this young and innovative firm uses a complex upcycling process to turn coffee grounds into a material that is traceable, that is eco-friendly, and that tells a story.The coffee grounds are collected by bicycle couriers from cafés across Berlin, then dried in community workshops and prepared for further processing. The material is made entirely of 100% plant-based ingredients and contains no harmful chemicals. What's more, it's not only durable and robust, but also fully recyclable. The material gives off a subtle coffee aroma and also its distinct color and texture convey the unmistakable look and feel of coffee. The final result is slightly different for each watch case, creating a true one-of-a-kind watch.  FROM COFFEE GROUNDS TO THE WATCH CASE  THE DESIGN: ONE-OF-A-KINDCoffee is a unique material for a one-of-a-kind watch. Due to the nature of the grounds, The beloved beverage is celebrated in the design of the watch by way of subtle details: depending on the angle, you can make out the shapes of charming coffee cups and beans. We cleverly recessed the crown into the case back to provide for a closed, round, and minimalist look.We designed the watch to be casual and a bit understated by incorporating a minimal Bauhaus style dial complete with a subtle sun-burst effect and thinned hour and minute hands. The core is made of stainless steel so you can rest assured that the watch will last for many years to come. Finally, in order for the Coffee Watch to properly display the time at all times, we incorporated a reliable and super precise quartz movement from the Swiss manufacturer Ronda. TIME FOR A SUSTAINABLE LIFESTYLECoffee and time go perfectly together: Coffee time is always time well spent. Nothing lifts our spirits like a coffee break. This is what we wish to convey: The Coffee Watch is a tribute to the champion of hot drinks. Coffee calms us down – then fills us with new energy!With the Coffee Watch, we want to show just how exciting a sustainable lifestyle can be. That it's worth challenging the status quo. That it's possible to make a watch out of something as seemingly useless as coffee grounds. That good looking accessories can be compatible with premium quality and sustainability. Ready to join us on our journey? Become one of the very first owners of this extraordinary watch. Together we can make a difference!100% CARBON NEUTRALWhen it comes to sustainability, it's not just the choice of materials that makes our Coffee Watch unique. We also make sure you can wear your new watch with a good conscious by compensating for 100% of the CO2 emissions generated during production. We do this by way of a climate donation. Together with Climate Partner we support projects engaged for a positive climate change. Our sustainability approach doesn't end there – we also choose the most eco-friendly alternatives for our packaging and shipping. OUR LOVE FOR COFFEE & WATCHES  DESIGNED BY AWARD-WINNING EXPERTSHaving an exciting material at your disposal is one thing. Creating an exciting watch is another. But our multi-award winning team of designers was up for the challenge! Initial sketches became concrete ideas; we browsed countless patterns, built prototypes, carried out tests and analyses, and continually made improvements to the details. Luckily, our designers never ran out off coffee! After more than three years of development, the Coffee Watch now is what we had always envisioned!  CHOOSE YOUR DESIGNLike coffee itself, the Coffee Watch is available in different types. The dial comes in two versions: a minimalist version with fine engravings, and a more classic version with typical Lilienthal Berlin numerals. As for the color, you can choose between black and silver.You can choose between straps made from vegetable-tanned organic leather and vegan cellulose-based leather in coffee tones as well as two mesh straps made of interwoven stainless steel in the colors of the dials. All the straps are extremely robust and comfortable to wear, and come with a quick-release mechanism for mixing and matching!  PREMIUM GERMAN QUALITYThe Coffee Watch has been our most challenging project to date. After all, we were dealing with a completely new material. Fortunately, we were able to rely entirely upon the expertise of our partners. The Coffee Watch is made in Germany by bona fide watchmaking experts. Thanks to the ""Made in Germany"" label, our watches are guaranteed to last – which is, by the way, part of our commitment to sustainability!  OUR GUARANTEEGreat watch making skills. Partners that we can rely on. A material that has been tested over and over again. A quality made in Germany. All this ensures that the Coffee Watch is ready to face any situation. And in case that there´s any issue, we´ll be there for you: We´ll provide a full 2-year guarantee!    SET YOUR STANDARDLilienthal is a young watch brand from Berlin. We started out five years ago with lots of ambition. Our goal always has been the same: to set new standards.We've won 25 awards for our designs, our multicultural work environment, and our eco-friendly production methods. We sell our watches all over the world and are backed by a dedicated community. Thanks to their help, we pulled off a real coup last year: In Germany, we won the ""Watch of the Year"" award, beating all the established luxury brands from Switzerland or Glashütte! And we're just getting started. The key to our success lies in going the extra mile and workig hard to improve upon everything we do. It's not for nothing that our motto is SET YOUR STANDARD! A WIN-WIN PARTNERSHIP Three years ago, we discovered a to-go cup made from coffee. Fascinated by the material, we decided it would be cool to use it to make one of our new watches. As luck would have it, Kaffeeform, the company that made the sustainable material, was located right around the corner from our office. It didn't take long for us to set up a meeting with Julian, the founder of Kaffeeform, and toss around some initial ideas. The chemistry was right and we quickly agreed to tackle the project together! Julian offered helpful suggestions each step of the way, from the very first sketches to the final prototypes. Without him, our Coffee Watch project would never have passed the idea stage. But now, our idea is becoming a reality!   HOW TO GET THE COFFEE WATCHSelect one of the available perks.

<p><b>New Tools Inc.</b> was created by construction tradesmen for the purpose of showcasing and marketing a newly designed circular saw tool accessory that safely eliminates the very dangerous practice of pinning up a saw's guard to make industrially common cuts. Our group is made up of dedicated builders, carpenters, masons, concrete-men, and roofers whose founding principle is that workers should not have to jeopardize safety in order to do their job while earning a living. Over the years, each of us have had the experience of either having to pin the guard up on a circular saw, or using someone else's saw that had its guard pinned up to make a cuts that would've been difficult or otherwise impossible. Pinning up the lower guard fully exposes the blade, which is why it is done. Our goal is to provide better and safer ways for tradesmen and DIY'ers to perform any and every type of saw cut they need to do without getting hurt. With construction heating up and projects rapidly expanding more hirees, skilled and unskilled, will be needed and using electric saws while performing a variety of jobs. Many of the new inductees into the world of construction will enter the workforce with little or no training and will learn their trades only by watching and doing. This is why we need to introduce <b>The Saw Guard Dog </b>now--it will aid the experienced and novices alike by making their saws easier and much safer to use, thus reducing the risk of bad practices becoming bad habits resulting in unnecessary bodily injuries.  </p>

<h3>Why Is Pinning the Guard Up Dangerous and why is it being done?</h3>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Pinning up a saw guard is </span>dangerous because it's the only protection that stands between the operator and the spinning blade. Exposing the sharp, quickly rotating blade to our human flesh doesn't seem like a good idea, and it isn't. A common saw blade related accident is when cutting through material, the saw's blade binds and pops back up onto the operator, possibly mangling them. If the guard is not there to drop back down in place to cover the saw blade (which it can't when <i>pinned</i> up), the user will sustain serious injuries.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> Even though the pinning up of a circular saw’s guard has been and will remain a violation of OSHA's safety rules indefinitely, it still remains a hidden secret practiced on job sites all across America daily. This is because 99% of the saws on the market today aren't designed for the guard to open every time under every type of cut that’s commonly performed. To counteract this saw guard flaw, workers will put themselves and others in danger and risk fines just to complete the job. It's most commonly done by wedging a piece of wood or nail under the guard's finger tab which then fixes the lower guard in the open position, exposing the saw blade permanently. Therefore, there is no way to quickly remove the wood or nail while operating the saw which would allow the guard to snap shut. It's also a faulty fix for making the saw cut in the first place because the wood or nail can come undone at an inopportune time and the guard could then snag and endanger the worker without warning. As experienced journeymen, we know the consequences of pinning a saw's guard up, as others do too, and the catastrophes that can happen, which for all involved </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">shouldn't be worth the risk for making dangerous saw cuts. This common practice will continue unless the Saw Guard Dog gets into the hands of all of these workers and creates a safe solution which still gives them the ability to comfortably operate the saw for difficult cuts.</span></span><br/></p>

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>The pictures below demonstrates the guard illegally and dangerously pinned up by a block of wood.

<h3><b>          The Consequences</b></h3>
<blockquote>""Emergency rooms see 10,600 patients a year thanks to these common tools. Unfortunately one California carpenter didn’t make it that far. He was cutting a purlin for a remodeling project while standing on a ladder and supporting himself on a piece of ceiling drywall. He had the saw’s safety guard pinned back. The drywall gave way and the saw slashed his jugular. He died a few minutes later.""  (<a href=""http://www.forbes.com/2009/12/21/most-dangerous-tools-business-healthcare-tools_slide_6.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Forbes.com</a>)</blockquote>
<p>In this <b>one </b>example of the thousands, if he had only been using the Saw Guard dog, all he would have had to do is release the device's trigger. The guard would have immediately snapped shut, saving him from any injury. </p>
<blockquote><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>FACT ""A circular saws blade spins faster than that of a table saw's at 120 mph. Hazard Magazine found that of all saw injuries, circular saws make up the largest group at 30 percent, 56 percent involve DIYers, 99 percent were males.""  (<a href=""http://hazards.org.master.com/texis/master/search/mysite.html?q=circular+saw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hazards.com</a>)</b></span></blockquote>
<p>What does this mean? Circular saws are much more dangerous than many people and workers even realize, not respecting the deadly blade enough. 30% of all saw injuries come from circular saw blades, which are caused by improperly working with the exposed blade pinned up. The Saw Guard Dog can <b>eliminate</b><i><b> </b></i>these injuries easily and efficiently, making the product benefit the working communities' safety incredibly.</p>
<b>The pictures below show the Saw Guard Dog attached to a Skilsaw. As you can see, it's small, stylish and is easy to operate.

<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">How the Saw Guard Dog Works:</span><br/></p>
<p>The  <b>SAW GUARD DOG</b> is the answer for eliminating the practice of pinning the guard. It simply allows the worker to only partially expose the blade <i>during </i>the cut, covering it back up afterwards. Now just simply pressing a button with your thumb is all it takes to make the cut (black button in above picture). Pressing the button in easily lifts the guard up. However, despite the fact that it lifts the guard just like pinning it up with a nail, it's not permanent. Simply releasing your thumb from the Saw Guard Dog button after the cut has been initiated will quickly snap the guard back shut at the finish of the cut, once more concealing the blade safely and making cutting yourself much harder. With the prevention of injuries, saving thousands of dollars in fines from OSHA, and securing worker safety interacting with circular saw blades, The Saw Guard Dog's benefits are revolutionary.</p>
<p><b>The GIF below demonstrates the clean simplicity of the Saw Guard Dog. When the guard is up, the worker's thumb is pressing the button forward, releasing snaps the guard down immediately and safely.</b><br/></p>
<p><img alt=""saw-dog-web"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/xrw3Bakm3S-y0zlRuXQ5UFM-V_IzmgMI-HDkmjXeIgeVSmTt0mRf3lZPo3s6CAK410Yf40VnofEtfG6E4KKBvkBsJtK9e4CHczvN1ebF1-p28riHVaTiFE946vroXj7TUxViiJI"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3>How Is It Different Than Pinning the Guard Up?</h3>
<div>
<p>Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) states:<b>1926.304(d)</b></p>
<blockquote>""Safety guards must never be removed when a tool is being used. For example, portable circular saws must be equipped with guards. An upper guard must cover the entire blade of the saw. A retractable lower guard must cover the teeth of the saw, except when it makes contact with the work material. The lower guard must automatically return to the covering position when the tool is withdrawn from the work."" (<a href=""https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=10692&amp;p_text_version=FALSE#1926.304(d)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">OSHA</a>).</blockquote>
<p>The Saw Guard Dog meets OSHA's specific standards of having to allow the guard to return to the covering position automatically as soon as the cut is finished. This keeps the blade covered any time which the worker's hand may be near the blade, which pinning it up doesn't do. This is revolutionary in the construction industry because it allows workers to continue making those difficult cuts while still being safe and fulfilling legal requirements. Therefore, workers won't have to worry about being caught by their managers or OSHA and receiving large fines.</p>
<p><b>The pictures below demonstrates the lifted guard with the worker's thumb pressing it, and the quick release as soon as the thumb is removed, keeping the product within OSHA's ruling.</b></p>

<p><span>(CAUTION! DO NOT BEND THE SAW GUARD DOG STEEL DRIVER)</span></p>
<p>Any damaged saw guard dog parts should be removed and/or replaced before operating the saw.</p>
<p>When servicing saw guard dog use only identical manufacturer replacement parts. </p>
<p>(WARNING) use of unauthorized parts or failure to follow maintenance and safety instructions may create a risk and serious personal injury.</p>
<p>(PLEASE MAKE CERTAIN THAT THE PERSON WHO IS TO USE THIS EQUIPMENT CAREFULLY READS AND <span style=""background-color: initial;"">UNDERSTANDS ALL OF THESE INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE OPERATING BOTH THE SAW GUARD DOG AND SAW).</span></p>
<br/>
<p><b>User information:</b></p>
<p>The SAW GUARD DOG is simple to use: it works by using either hand's thumbs to push a button driver forward, this in turn deploys a guard lifting mechanism that raises the guard as needed to initiate the cut  all the while <b>keeping both hands away from the saw blade</b> and safely holding onto the handles on the saw.</p>
<p>Only activate saw guard dog button when guard binding will occur or unless making special cuts such as pocket cuts or compound miter cuts, for all other sawing the lower guard should operate automatically as designed without the assistance of the saw guard dog.<br/></p>
<p>It’s only necessary to push on the button driver long enough to raise the guard up to initiate the cut after which the button is released and the cut is performed and completed as usual, in which the guard will <b>automatically</b> close as designed.</p>
<p><b>Future products:</b></p>
<p>As a follow up to the anticipated success of the SAW GUARD DOG we’re working on designs and prototypes for the new Skilsaw 77LT and the Big Foot beam saw that will be introduce in the Fall of 2015.</p>
<p>By year’s end 2015 we’ll begin the designing and prototype process for  SAW GUARD DOG units for the Makita, Dewalt and Milwaukee saws.</p>
<h2><b>Summary:</b></h2>
<p>The SAW GUARD DOG Is a must have for all craftsmen and employers alike, it’s a guaranteed win-win tool for everyone. The main consequences of the Saw Guard Dog should make <b>pinning up the guard unnecessary and obsolete, directly <i>reducing worker injuries</i> and <i>fines</i> given by OSHA</b>.</p>
<p>Craftsmen will enjoy the benefits of how it makes clearly seeing the cut before engaging the saws trigger and the ease of performing difficult cuts without dangerously pre-exposing the saws blade to the user. </p>

New Tools Inc. was created by construction tradesmen for the purpose of showcasing and marketing a newly designed circular saw tool accessory that safely eliminates the very dangerous practice of pinning up a saw's guard to make industrially common cuts. Our group is made up of dedicated builders, carpenters, masons, concrete-men, and roofers whose founding principle is that workers should not have to jeopardize safety in order to do their job while earning a living. Over the years, each of us have had the experience of either having to pin the guard up on a circular saw, or using someone else's saw that had its guard pinned up to make a cuts that would've been difficult or otherwise impossible. Pinning up the lower guard fully exposes the blade, which is why it is done. Our goal is to provide better and safer ways for tradesmen and DIY'ers to perform any and every type of saw cut they need to do without getting hurt. With construction heating up and projects rapidly expanding more hirees, skilled and unskilled, will be needed and using electric saws while performing a variety of jobs. Many of the new inductees into the world of construction will enter the workforce with little or no training and will learn their trades only by watching and doing. This is why we need to introduce The Saw Guard Dog now--it will aid the experienced and novices alike by making their saws easier and much safer to use, thus reducing the risk of bad practices becoming bad habits resulting in unnecessary bodily injuries.  

The video below demonstrates some cuts made easier by the Saw Guard Dog.

Why Is Pinning the Guard Up Dangerous and why is it being done?
Pinning up a saw guard is dangerous because it's the only protection that stands between the operator and the spinning blade. Exposing the sharp, quickly rotating blade to our human flesh doesn't seem like a good idea, and it isn't. A common saw blade related accident is when cutting through material, the saw's blade binds and pops back up onto the operator, possibly mangling them. If the guard is not there to drop back down in place to cover the saw blade (which it can't when pinned up), the user will sustain serious injuries. Even though the pinning up of a circular saw’s guard has been and will remain a violation of OSHA's safety rules indefinitely, it still remains a hidden secret practiced on job sites all across America daily. This is because 99% of the saws on the market today aren't designed for the guard to open every time under every type of cut that’s commonly performed. To counteract this saw guard flaw, workers will put themselves and others in danger and risk fines just to complete the job. It's most commonly done by wedging a piece of wood or nail under the guard's finger tab which then fixes the lower guard in the open position, exposing the saw blade permanently. Therefore, there is no way to quickly remove the wood or nail while operating the saw which would allow the guard to snap shut. It's also a faulty fix for making the saw cut in the first place because the wood or nail can come undone at an inopportune time and the guard could then snag and endanger the worker without warning. As experienced journeymen, we know the consequences of pinning a saw's guard up, as others do too, and the catastrophes that can happen, which for all involved shouldn't be worth the risk for making dangerous saw cuts. This common practice will continue unless the Saw Guard Dog gets into the hands of all of these workers and creates a safe solution which still gives them the ability to comfortably operate the saw for difficult cuts.

The pictures below demonstrates the guard illegally and dangerously pinned up by a block of wood. This leaves the blade fully exposed during the cut and at all other times. Workers also can use nails to do the same thing, and no matter what it is an unsafe fix.


This video demonstrates how the wood (or nail) permanently locks the guard up, making the cut possible but also unsafe.


          The Consequences
""Emergency rooms see 10,600 patients a year thanks to these common tools. Unfortunately one California carpenter didn’t make it that far. He was cutting a purlin for a remodeling project while standing on a ladder and supporting himself on a piece of ceiling drywall. He had the saw’s safety guard pinned back. The drywall gave way and the saw slashed his jugular. He died a few minutes later.""  (Forbes.com)
In this one example of the thousands, if he had only been using the Saw Guard dog, all he would have had to do is release the device's trigger. The guard would have immediately snapped shut, saving him from any injury. 
FACT ""A circular saws blade spins faster than that of a table saw's at 120 mph. Hazard Magazine found that of all saw injuries, circular saws make up the largest group at 30 percent, 56 percent involve DIYers, 99 percent were males.""  (Hazards.com)
What does this mean? Circular saws are much more dangerous than many people and workers even realize, not respecting the deadly blade enough. 30% of all saw injuries come from circular saw blades, which are caused by improperly working with the exposed blade pinned up. The Saw Guard Dog can eliminate these injuries easily and efficiently, making the product benefit the working communities' safety incredibly.
The pictures below show the Saw Guard Dog attached to a Skilsaw. As you can see, it's small, stylish and is easy to operate. It looks natural, and only requires a brief, easy installation described later.




How the Saw Guard Dog Works:
The  SAW GUARD DOG is the answer for eliminating the practice of pinning the guard. It simply allows the worker to only partially expose the blade during the cut, covering it back up afterwards. Now just simply pressing a button with your thumb is all it takes to make the cut (black button in above picture). Pressing the button in easily lifts the guard up. However, despite the fact that it lifts the guard just like pinning it up with a nail, it's not permanent. Simply releasing your thumb from the Saw Guard Dog button after the cut has been initiated will quickly snap the guard back shut at the finish of the cut, once more concealing the blade safely and making cutting yourself much harder. With the prevention of injuries, saving thousands of dollars in fines from OSHA, and securing worker safety interacting with circular saw blades, The Saw Guard Dog's benefits are revolutionary.
The GIF below demonstrates the clean simplicity of the Saw Guard Dog. When the guard is up, the worker's thumb is pressing the button forward, releasing snaps the guard down immediately and safely.




How Is It Different Than Pinning the Guard Up?

Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) states:1926.304(d)
""Safety guards must never be removed when a tool is being used. For example, portable circular saws must be equipped with guards. An upper guard must cover the entire blade of the saw. A retractable lower guard must cover the teeth of the saw, except when it makes contact with the work material. The lower guard must automatically return to the covering position when the tool is withdrawn from the work."" (OSHA).
The Saw Guard Dog meets OSHA's specific standards of having to allow the guard to return to the covering position automatically as soon as the cut is finished. This keeps the blade covered any time which the worker's hand may be near the blade, which pinning it up doesn't do. This is revolutionary in the construction industry because it allows workers to continue making those difficult cuts while still being safe and fulfilling legal requirements. Therefore, workers won't have to worry about being caught by their managers or OSHA and receiving large fines.
The pictures below demonstrates the lifted guard with the worker's thumb pressing it, and the quick release as soon as the thumb is removed, keeping the product within OSHA's ruling.




Unlike using a nail or wood, the guard is easily maneuverable here, helping to expose the only part of the blade needed for the cut, and easily covering it again afterwards.



Why We Need YOUR Help
The sooner we can being distributing the product into the hands of any worker out there, the sooner we prevent injuries and fines. There's already a growing demand for the SAW GUARD DOG here in So. California, coming from tradesmen and business owners who are asking us when it's going to be available and how they can get one. Currently, we lack the funds to mass produce the product, market it to the public, and reach our audience. By helping us today with a backing of whatever means possible, the Saw Guard Dog will be made readily available this summer to anyone that wants to own one.
We have the finished product and a small inventory currently to fulfill the local demand we already have. We're ready to start manufacturing them here in the USA: to get started we're in need of $15,000 to fulfill our current goals. The following details how we plan to spend the minimum amount of money raised: 

Tooling $1,000: Includes finishing the die cut stamp plates and welding jigs to produce the product faster, easier, and more thoroughly.
Insurance $2,000: General liability $2,000,000 policy to protect our company.
Initial inventory $8,000: unit parts and packaging sufficient to satisfy our pledge goals and fulfill more orders. 
Advertising (PPC- Google Adwords, Bing) $2,000: 60 day online marketing plan to get the word out and begin selling.


We plan to use the revenue generated from sales to continue to improve the product, bring the cost down for us and consumers, and supply the demand. We also are looking for people who can help distribute the product on any level. If we reach above the $15,000 goal, we plan to focus on inventory and advertising, growing the brand, and lower the cost. We also would look into expanding the design to fit even more circular saws on the market to reach as many workers as we can.

  Maintenance and Safety rules

(CAUTION! DO NOT BEND THE SAW GUARD DOG STEEL DRIVER)
Any damaged saw guard dog parts should be removed and/or replaced before operating the saw.
When servicing saw guard dog use only identical manufacturer replacement parts. 
(WARNING) use of unauthorized parts or failure to follow maintenance and safety instructions may create a risk and serious personal injury.
(PLEASE MAKE CERTAIN THAT THE PERSON WHO IS TO USE THIS EQUIPMENT CAREFULLY READS AND UNDERSTANDS ALL OF THESE INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE OPERATING BOTH THE SAW GUARD DOG AND SAW).

User information:
The SAW GUARD DOG is simple to use: it works by using either hand's thumbs to push a button driver forward, this in turn deploys a guard lifting mechanism that raises the guard as needed to initiate the cut  all the while keeping both hands away from the saw blade and safely holding onto the handles on the saw.
Only activate saw guard dog button when guard binding will occur or unless making special cuts such as pocket cuts or compound miter cuts, for all other sawing the lower guard should operate automatically as designed without the assistance of the saw guard dog.
It’s only necessary to push on the button driver long enough to raise the guard up to initiate the cut after which the button is released and the cut is performed and completed as usual, in which the guard will automatically close as designed.
Future products:
As a follow up to the anticipated success of the SAW GUARD DOG we’re working on designs and prototypes for the new Skilsaw 77LT and the Big Foot beam saw that will be introduce in the Fall of 2015.
By year’s end 2015 we’ll begin the designing and prototype process for  SAW GUARD DOG units for the Makita, Dewalt and Milwaukee saws.
Summary:
The SAW GUARD DOG Is a must have for all craftsmen and employers alike, it’s a guaranteed win-win tool for everyone. The main consequences of the Saw Guard Dog should make pinning up the guard unnecessary and obsolete, directly reducing worker injuries and fines given by OSHA.
Craftsmen will enjoy the benefits of how it makes clearly seeing the cut before engaging the saws trigger and the ease of performing difficult cuts without dangerously pre-exposing the saws blade to the user. 
Employers will like the fact that their workers are not recklessly pinning up the saw’s guard with a piece of wood or nail for making the difficult cuts while doing their jobs. 
We’re asking for your help by whatever means possible. If you only financially support one Indiegogo project per month and you already made a pledge this month please remember us and consider us the next time.
