<div>Hello, we are Sally Davis and Ruth Torjussen, two local mums who are opening the first Play Cafe to incorporate play-pods for children aged 0- 4 years. We are opening on Portland Road in West Hove/ Portslade. We are opening the cafe with inter-changeable Play Pods designed specifically for babies and pre-school children which is something that has not been seen in any other cafe within the Brighton and Hove area. Our Play Cafe will be putting the needs of the parents and children first. We will offer free storytime &amp; singing sessions, mini softplay, secure entry, bumbo's, high chairs, baby change, birthday party hire, Wi-Fi and a community notice board,   We are committed to opening a space where  parents and children  are at the heart of the business, serving yummy food and drinks; excellent coffee, tea, smoothies, sandwiches, soups, cakes and pastries. This will be a Play Cafe like no other, dedicated to local families.</div>
<div>
<b>What is a Play Cafe?<br/></b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">A play cafe is a cafe which is tailored to the needs of young children (0-4yrs) and their families.  The cafe will be set out with soft play spaces and a selection of activities for toddlers and pre-school children. We are open to all ideas and we'll actively encourage feedback from our customers. The play cafe will also be available to host birthday parties for children under the age of 5 years and parent group meet-ups at selected hours. </span>
</div>
<div>
<b>Who Are We?</b><br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Sally currently runs Whizz Bang Pop Children's Entertainment and Theatre. She writes and directs children's plays and has over 11 years of experience in entertaining little ones.  She has two boys aged 1 and 5 years and understands the needs of busy parents. Ruth is a local film-maker, she has 2 grown-up sons and has extensive experience in childcare.  Both have been residents of Brighton for over 18 years and they love the community feel within the local areas, something which they aim to promote at Small Talk Play Cafe. They know only too well the perils of attempting to keep a little one quiet whilst sitting in a cafe. They are both passionate about creating a new type of cafe at the heart of the parent community.</span>
</div>
<div>
<b>Your Support Means SO MUCH</b><br/>By supporting this campaign you will be helping to generate a warm and welcoming space for all children and parents (and grannies, grandads, carers, aunts and uncles and friends). The cafe will be informed by what the local community wants and by backing this campaign you can feel part of the foundations of the business and the idea.  Please ask yourself if having a play cafe in this area would enhance your life. Take a look at what we will provide and then please see if you are tempted by any of amazing rewards that you can get from supporting our new business.</div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We are aiming to raise  a minimum of £4,000, which would help purchase the play-pods and play modules for our local toddlers and pre-schoolers to play in as well as some of the other costs of setting up a cafe.</p>

Playing with kids builds a bond that will last forever.  It lets them know that they are loved and appreciated and opens the door for sharing problems and concerns when the need arises.  The Inspiration Playground will also be a place where differently abled 
parents can get in on the fun and special bonding that comes with play.<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443832245/by52glr4dmz1q5oect7g.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><p></p>

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p></p>
<p><b>What is an INCLUSIVE playground?  What will we build together?<br/></b></p>
<p>An inclusive playground is not only accessible, but encourages and enables people of ALL abilities to engage with one another. In 
addition to ramps, accessible swings and play panels, Inspiration Playground will have sensory walls, a quiet Sensory Garden, water play, splash Pads, and 
more.  Together we will build a destination playground with</p>
<ul><ul>
<li>Barrier-free surfacing materials, inclusive and
     challenging play environments, sensory experiences that engage all five
     senses, and family gathering spaces that will make it one of the most
     innovative outdoor venues in the Northwest.</li>
<li>Design elements that address the autistic spectrum
     including enclosed spaces, which provide an area to regulate their sensory
     systems after a time of high sensory input, perimeter pathways and other
     safety features.  </li>
<li>Conveniently located, enhanced and accessible family
     restroom facilities.</li>
<li>A Sensory Garden that will engage all the senses as
     visitors interact with its colorful scented plantings, playful sound
     features, and hands-on tactile elements. <br/>
</li>
</ul></ul>
<p></p>
<p><b></b>The City has committed early dollars to the project and
     will oversee construction and maintenance of the playground once
     built—assuring donors of the lasting value and legacy of
     their investment.</p>
<b></b><p><b>$250,000-Is that enough to fund this incredible idea?</b></p>
<p>Not quite.  Through generous donations, grants and money from the City of Bellevue, we have raised $3.8M of our $5.5M goal.  We

 are looking for help from you, our community, to raise the additional funds 
by launching this Indiegogo campaign.  In addition to helping 
us fund this amazing project, this campaign will:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Raise awareness about the project by promoting it to a wider audience. </span></li>
<li><span>
Give the community a personal connection to the project and the chance to be a part of its success.</span></li>
<li><span>Give 
people an opportunity to act on their values in a meaningful way by 
making a statement:  ""I want my world to be inclusive."" </span></li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><b>Is my donation Tax Deductible?  What if I sponsor a fence item?</b>
</p>
<p>Yes.  The Bellevue Rotary Club is a 
501(c)3 nonprofit organization (Federal Tax ID 91-1501333).  Donations are tax deductible.  
</p>
When you
 sponsor a leaf, animal or flower, your payment does not entitle you to 
receive these items, but rather is a charitable contribution to the 
Bellevue Rotary Club Inspiration Playground. For each contribution, an 
engraved item will be
 placed on the Honor Wall. As any benefits in return for the 
contribution 
are considered ""incidental,"" the full amount of your contribution is 
deductible for federal tax purposes.  Donors will  be emailed a receipt for their donation from FirstGiving. <br/><br/><p><b>How do I tell you what I want written on my Inspiration Playground fence item?</b><br/>
</p>
<p>We are going to collect this information from backers during the campaign.<br/></p>
<p><b>Are there any rules I should know about?</b><br/></p>
<p>Discriminatory or inappropriate messages will not be permitted.  The Bellevue Rotary Club is a 
501(c)3 nonprofit organization and reserves the right of refusal of 
any order found to be inappropriate or in violation of the Bellevue Rotary Club policies, directives, or guidelines. <br/></p>

fully inclusive or can't accommodate their needs. With your support, the Inspiration 
Playground will become the Eastside's destination playground for active and inclusive 
outdoor fun — a wonderful place of PLAY FOR ALL.


Why is this so important for our community?

By fostering an environment where diversity is respected and valued, inclusive play also gives able-bodied children the opportunity to experience children with different abilities as equals, teaching the vital lessons of compassion, awareness and acceptance.

play also gives able-bodied children the opportunity to experience children

awareness and acceptance.






Play for kids..and the kid-at-heart



Playing with kids builds a bond that will last forever.  It lets them know that they are loved and appreciated and opens the door for sharing problems and concerns when the need arises.  The Inspiration Playground will also be a place where differently abled 
parents can get in on the fun and special bonding that comes with play.


FAQ

What is an INCLUSIVE playground?  What will we build together?
An inclusive playground is not only accessible, but encourages and enables people of ALL abilities to engage with one another. In 
addition to ramps, accessible swings and play panels, Inspiration Playground will have sensory walls, a quiet Sensory Garden, water play, splash Pads, and 
more.  Together we will build a destination playground with

Barrier-free surfacing materials, inclusive and
     challenging play environments, sensory experiences that engage all five
     senses, and family gathering spaces that will make it one of the most
     innovative outdoor venues in the Northwest.
Design elements that address the autistic spectrum
     including enclosed spaces, which provide an area to regulate their sensory
     systems after a time of high sensory input, perimeter pathways and other
     safety features.  
Conveniently located, enhanced and accessible family
     restroom facilities.
A Sensory Garden that will engage all the senses as
     visitors interact with its colorful scented plantings, playful sound
     features, and hands-on tactile elements. 



The City has committed early dollars to the project and
     will oversee construction and maintenance of the playground once
     built—assuring donors of the lasting value and legacy of
     their investment.
$250,000-Is that enough to fund this incredible idea?
Not quite.  Through generous donations, grants and money from the City of Bellevue, we have raised $3.8M of our $5.5M goal.  We

 are looking for help from you, our community, to raise the additional funds 
by launching this Indiegogo campaign.  In addition to helping 
us fund this amazing project, this campaign will:

Raise awareness about the project by promoting it to a wider audience. 

Give the community a personal connection to the project and the chance to be a part of its success.
Give 
people an opportunity to act on their values in a meaningful way by 
making a statement:  ""I want my world to be inclusive."" 


Is my donation Tax Deductible?  What if I sponsor a fence item?

Yes.  The Bellevue Rotary Club is a 
501(c)3 nonprofit organization (Federal Tax ID 91-1501333).  Donations are tax deductible.  

When you
 sponsor a leaf, animal or flower, your payment does not entitle you to 
receive these items, but rather is a charitable contribution to the 
Bellevue Rotary Club Inspiration Playground. For each contribution, an 
engraved item will be
 placed on the Honor Wall. As any benefits in return for the 
contribution 
are considered ""incidental,"" the full amount of your contribution is 
deductible for federal tax purposes.  Donors will  be emailed a receipt for their donation from FirstGiving. How do I tell you what I want written on my Inspiration Playground fence item?

We are going to collect this information from backers during the campaign.
Are there any rules I should know about?
Discriminatory or inappropriate messages will not be permitted.  The Bellevue Rotary Club is a 
501(c)3 nonprofit organization and reserves the right of refusal of 
any order found to be inappropriate or in violation of the Bellevue Rotary Club policies, directives, or guidelines.

<div><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><span>My name is Jesse and I am currently looking to start offer a new service in the Bloomington, IL area.  When I became a father I learned how much waste is involved in raising a baby.  This ranges from packaging and disposable diapers to cleaning products and whats inside those diapers.  Initially, I considered this the cost of the joy, my daughter, I was helping to raise.  Over time my wife and I began to wonder what we could do to reduce or manage the amount of waste we produced.  I previously lived in the nearby town of Pontiac and the local landfill there was always a constant reminder of how much we as people throw out.</span></span></div>

</div>
<div><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><span>Our family switched to cloth diapers fairly early on and we learned some very unexpected things.  We learned that cloth diapers did not significantly change the cost of keeping our baby happy and healthy.  The cost actually went down after the initial investment.  I began to wonder why this was an uncommon practice.  As I spread word around, I noticed most people did not realize that cloth diapers had any real benefits.  Many people expected the costs and workload to go up, and cleanliness to go down.  It was at this time I decided I needed to act.  That is why I am here now, I would like your help to make my local area healthier and happier for babies while also reducing the cost and waste associated with raising a baby.<br/></span></span></div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>I am hoping to acquire $3000. With this initial investment I will be able to finance some low interest SBA loans to get initial stock and material needed. What I need most to get this venture is a car for pickups and deliveries, a new washer with hookups, initial stock of diapers and other sundries like soap, and finally all the odds and ends that come up in bureaucracy like licenses, permits, and acknowledgements.  </p>
<p>Our business plan is to start by offering diapers and accessories needed to provide for a child for about 4 days at a time and we will pick up the dirty and deliver fresh on that schedule twice weekly. At that we would charge $60 for a month.

</div></div>","Hello,
My name is Jesse and I am currently looking to start offer a new service in the Bloomington, IL area.  When I became a father I learned how much waste is involved in raising a baby.  This ranges from packaging and disposable diapers to cleaning products and whats inside those diapers.  Initially, I considered this the cost of the joy, my daughter, I was helping to raise.  Over time my wife and I began to wonder what we could do to reduce or manage the amount of waste we produced.  I previously lived in the nearby town of Pontiac and the local landfill there was always a constant reminder of how much we as people throw out.

My Story

Our family switched to cloth diapers fairly early on and we learned some very unexpected things.  We learned that cloth diapers did not significantly change the cost of keeping our baby happy and healthy.  The cost actually went down after the initial investment.  I began to wonder why this was an uncommon practice.  As I spread word around, I noticed most people did not realize that cloth diapers had any real benefits.  Many people expected the costs and workload to go up, and cleanliness to go down.  It was at this time I decided I needed to act.  That is why I am here now, I would like your help to make my local area healthier and happier for babies while also reducing the cost and waste associated with raising a baby.   What We Need & What You Get I am hoping to acquire $3000. With this initial investment I will be able to finance some low interest SBA loans to get initial stock and material needed. What I need most to get this venture is a car for pickups and deliveries, a new washer with hookups, initial stock of diapers and other sundries like soap, and finally all the odds and ends that come up in bureaucracy like licenses, permits, and acknowledgements.  
Our business plan is to start by offering diapers and accessories needed to provide for a child for about 4 days at a time and we will pick up the dirty and deliver fresh on that schedule twice weekly. At that we would charge $60 for a month. This would also include diaper liners, pail liners, and other odds and ends as needed with access to our webpage which will have a community forum on it to help anyone with questions. 
    This is about helping parents and our community I will be offering my hard learned lessons as a parent who used cloth diapers to mothers and fathers who want to try but aren't sure they have the knowledge necessary to properly care for the diapers and your child. This service would provide fresh clean diapers twice a week to customers.  Our service is meant to offer a lower cost green opportunity that takes the waste and work out of cloth diapers. The great thing about the way we are setting up our service is that each child will be set up with their own set up diapers for their contract.

<h2></h2>
<p>Sweet Mary's Bakery began almost nine years ago, when in 2006, 
Akron-native Mary Fann's then boyfriend (and current husband), Justin 
Hospodarsky decided he just <i>could not</i> eat all of those delicious 
cookies all by himself. (He really, really tried.)  As Mary 
couldn't simply stop baking, what was the solution? Why to sell them, of
 course! </p>
<p>Starting out by baking out of the kitchen of an 
Akron church, then moving to the basement of an Akron restaurant, Sweet Mary's 
Bakery has come a long way! We've expanded our menu from cookies to include 
cakes, pies, muffins, quiche, rolls, and as Mary says ""just about anything you
 can put in an oven"". <br/></p>
<p>Sweet Mary has more than outgrown the made-to-order 
business.</p>
<h4 align=""center""><i>And now we're asking for your help to take us to the next level: </i></h4>
<p></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">a Retail Bakery! </h3>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>We already have the <i>perfect</i>
 location at 161 S. Main Street in the heart of 
downtown Akron, across from the amazing Civic Theater. We couldn't be 
more excited to bring a full bakery back to downtown,
 but here's the problem: it's expensive. Making lots of delicious 
goodies takes equipment, staff, and inventory, to name just a few.
<p>While we already have a small business loan in 
process, as well as some pending grants from the City of Akron, we're just
 not quite there. Sweet Mary's Bakery wouldn't be what it is today if it
 weren't for the unwavering support of our families, friends, and 
clients, so now we're turning to you one more time.  <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3>
<h3>The Sweet (and not-so-sweet) Facts</h3>
<p>We estimate our total Start-Up costs to be about 
$150,000. <i>Whoa</i> is right. Here's the 
breakdown:</p>
<p>
</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Equipment, bakery cases, etc.</td>
<td>$65,000.00</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rebuild &amp; Design</td>
<td>$25,000.00</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Starting operating expenses, opening inventory, first month wages for staff,  everything else</td>
<td>$60,000.00</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Total!!</td>
<td><b>$150,000.00<br/><br/></b></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
Our small business loan will pay for most of our start-up costs; the equipment, fixtures, permits, opening inventory, etc. The grants we're working on getting through the City of Akron will help pay for our design and rebuild costs, but not all of them. We need a little help to fill in the gaps and make sure we'll be able to keep things running smoothly. Your contribution 
would go toward some of our build-out and design costs, pre-opening salaries for
 our staff, and working capital to keep things running while we get 
situated.<br/><br/> <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1397558/files/20150419172939-women_baking_together2.jpg?1429489779"" src="""" style=""width: 298.91px; height: 230px;""/></p>
<br/><br/><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Sweet Mary's - Downtown Akron's only Micro-Bakery</h2> <br/>""<i>So what exactly is a micro-bakery?</i>"" is a frequent question we're asked.  Most local bakeries fall under the category of ""cakery"", a retail food service shop that sells cakes, cupcakes, sometimes cookies and other related sweets.  By contrast, a ""bakery"", as we're defining it, sells those items <b><i>plus</i></b> pies, breads, muffins, scones, pastries, and a variety of other baked items, both savory and sweet.  <br/><br/>As a micro-bakery, Sweet Mary's Bakery will not only carry the variety of items mentioned above, but we will make everything fresh, from-scratch in small batches daily.  We'll be sourcing many of our ingredients from local farms and other local vendors so we can ensure you get a fresh, quality product every time and can support our community in the process. By operating as a micro-bakery, we're able to have a more versatile menu to highlight seasonal produce, and implement some feedback from you as well.  It also allows us some flexibility for your custom orders, including allergy and/or diet concerns.  So yes, we'll still have carrot cake with cream cheese frosting, frosted sugar cookies, pecan pie, and no-bake cookies; but we know you'll find some new loves in a savory breakfast muffin with bacon and cheddar, a spinach and feta handpie, or a toasted handmade bagel. <br/><br/>With hours from 7am - 2pm M-F, and 10am - 3pm on Saturdays, we'll be offering a variety of fresh baked menu items for breakfast and lunch that you can wash down with French pressed coffee ground fresh daily from Kent's own Bent Tree Coffee Roasters, a bottle of pop from Akron's own Norka Beverage Co., or some good old fashioned milk.  You'll also be able to stop by our Concession window in the Skywalk between the Law Building on South Main Street and the Municipal Building on South High Street, which will be open 7am-2pm M-F, and pick up a hot cup of coffee or a cold pop, and a treat to go with it.  For building tenants and their guests, we will also feature a pick-up window in the lobby of the Law building for quick on-the-go service.   And you can count on us to be open special hours for events at the Civic, lock 3, or along South Main Street!<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1397577/files/20150419174331-cooking_up_some_love_retro.jpg?1429490611"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><br/><h3>Why We Need YOU<br/>
</h3>
<p>We are increasingly asked ""When are you opening?!?!"" and that's certainly a valid question.  So, our target opening date is <b>June 15th</b>  (we've been teasing you with ""Spring 2015"" all year, and we have until June 21st to make that happen! ;))<br/></p>
<p>In order to meet that deadline we have <i>a lot</i> of work to do. The bakery isn't exactly eh-hem... ""turn-key"". Though we do have quite a bit of the funding in process, we need your help to turn it from drab to fab. The are so many odds and ends involved in the opening, and they all cost money and they all add up. (We've done the math!) What your money will go towards are the design and rebuild costs, including our new floor, a front display window, our awning and signage, patio tables and chairs (so you can sit outside and sip your morning coffee or tea and enjoy your slice of lemon meringue pie in the sunshine, as you should).  It will also go toward pre-opening salaries for our staff, so we can all get up to speed and ready to keep up with your voracious appetite for all things delicious, while providing you with fun and friendly customer service.  And finally, a little bit more of it will go toward working capital and operating expenses to keep our doors open while we get settled in and get the word out.  </p>

With recent successful additions to the area including the Nightlight Theater, Nuevo Modern Mexican, Akron Art Walks, and more, your investment in our future is an investment in the future of Akron, by supporting the rebirth of the downtown retail and food scene.<p>To thank you for your support, we have compiled a bunch of exciting reward options we think you'll really like. You'll have an opportunity to taste some of our goodies, sport some Sweet Mary's gear and show your Akron pride, try out some of the amazing Bent Tree Coffee that we'll be featuring, or even hang out with Sweet Mary and create your own specialty cake or pie!

</div><h2></h2> <div> <h3>It Ain't Easy Being Sweet<br/>
</h3> <p> It's no secret that the food business is a tough one. There are so many moving parts that unless they're all operating smoothly, things can go sour pretty quickly.  By starting out as a made-to-order business almost nine years ago, Sweet Mary's Bakery has been able to build up a loyal customer base (thank you!!), perfect our recipes and techniques, and solidify our vision. <br/></p>
<p>We made the big mistakes early, like that three-tier baby shower cake for 35 people that could have fed 150 (Nicole, you know what I'm talking about), or underestimating the value of planning ahead for events, or charging $1 each for a cupcake to be competitive then discovering it <i>costs</i> me more than that to make one.  But the important point is that we've been there, we've done that and we've learned and improved. So now we're READY.</p>
<p>Without showing you all the spreadsheets (and there are <i>spreadsheets. </i>You have no idea.) it's hard to prove to you just how ready we are, unless you've been a customer of ours.  <br/></p>

</div></div>","The Short and Sweet 

Sweet Mary's Bakery began almost nine years ago, when in 2006, 
Akron-native Mary Fann's then boyfriend (and current husband), Justin 
Hospodarsky decided he just could not eat all of those delicious 
cookies all by himself. (He really, really tried.)  As Mary 
couldn't simply stop baking, what was the solution? Why to sell them, of
 course! 
Starting out by baking out of the kitchen of an 
Akron church, then moving to the basement of an Akron restaurant, Sweet Mary's 
Bakery has come a long way! We've expanded our menu from cookies to include 
cakes, pies, muffins, quiche, rolls, and as Mary says ""just about anything you
 can put in an oven"". 
Sweet Mary has more than outgrown the made-to-order 
business.
And now we're asking for your help to take us to the next level: 

a Retail Bakery! 









We already have the perfect
 location at 161 S. Main Street in the heart of 
downtown Akron, across from the amazing Civic Theater. We couldn't be 
more excited to bring a full bakery back to downtown,
 but here's the problem: it's expensive. Making lots of delicious 
goodies takes equipment, staff, and inventory, to name just a few.
While we already have a small business loan in 
process, as well as some pending grants from the City of Akron, we're just
 not quite there. Sweet Mary's Bakery wouldn't be what it is today if it
 weren't for the unwavering support of our families, friends, and 
clients, so now we're turning to you one more time.  

 
The Sweet (and not-so-sweet) Facts
We estimate our total Start-Up costs to be about 
$150,000. Whoa is right. Here's the 
breakdown:





Equipment, bakery cases, etc.
$65,000.00


Rebuild & Design
$25,000.00


Starting operating expenses, opening inventory, first month wages for staff,  everything else
$60,000.00


Total!!
$150,000.00



Our small business loan will pay for most of our start-up costs; the equipment, fixtures, permits, opening inventory, etc. The grants we're working on getting through the City of Akron will help pay for our design and rebuild costs, but not all of them. We need a little help to fill in the gaps and make sure we'll be able to keep things running smoothly. Your contribution 
would go toward some of our build-out and design costs, pre-opening salaries for
 our staff, and working capital to keep things running while we get 
situated. 
Sweet Mary's - Downtown Akron's only Micro-Bakery ""So what exactly is a micro-bakery?"" is a frequent question we're asked.  Most local bakeries fall under the category of ""cakery"", a retail food service shop that sells cakes, cupcakes, sometimes cookies and other related sweets.  By contrast, a ""bakery"", as we're defining it, sells those items plus pies, breads, muffins, scones, pastries, and a variety of other baked items, both savory and sweet.  As a micro-bakery, Sweet Mary's Bakery will not only carry the variety of items mentioned above, but we will make everything fresh, from-scratch in small batches daily.  We'll be sourcing many of our ingredients from local farms and other local vendors so we can ensure you get a fresh, quality product every time and can support our community in the process. By operating as a micro-bakery, we're able to have a more versatile menu to highlight seasonal produce, and implement some feedback from you as well.  It also allows us some flexibility for your custom orders, including allergy and/or diet concerns.  So yes, we'll still have carrot cake with cream cheese frosting, frosted sugar cookies, pecan pie, and no-bake cookies; but we know you'll find some new loves in a savory breakfast muffin with bacon and cheddar, a spinach and feta handpie, or a toasted handmade bagel. With hours from 7am - 2pm M-F, and 10am - 3pm on Saturdays, we'll be offering a variety of fresh baked menu items for breakfast and lunch that you can wash down with French pressed coffee ground fresh daily from Kent's own Bent Tree Coffee Roasters, a bottle of pop from Akron's own Norka Beverage Co., or some good old fashioned milk.  You'll also be able to stop by our Concession window in the Skywalk between the Law Building on South Main Street and the Municipal Building on South High Street, which will be open 7am-2pm M-F, and pick up a hot cup of coffee or a cold pop, and a treat to go with it.  For building tenants and their guests, we will also feature a pick-up window in the lobby of the Law building for quick on-the-go service.   And you can count on us to be open special hours for events at the Civic, lock 3, or along South Main Street!
Why We Need YOU

We are increasingly asked ""When are you opening?!?!"" and that's certainly a valid question.  So, our target opening date is June 15th  (we've been teasing you with ""Spring 2015"" all year, and we have until June 21st to make that happen! ;))
In order to meet that deadline we have a lot of work to do. The bakery isn't exactly eh-hem... ""turn-key"". Though we do have quite a bit of the funding in process, we need your help to turn it from drab to fab. The are so many odds and ends involved in the opening, and they all cost money and they all add up. (We've done the math!) What your money will go towards are the design and rebuild costs, including our new floor, a front display window, our awning and signage, patio tables and chairs (so you can sit outside and sip your morning coffee or tea and enjoy your slice of lemon meringue pie in the sunshine, as you should).  It will also go toward pre-opening salaries for our staff, so we can all get up to speed and ready to keep up with your voracious appetite for all things delicious, while providing you with fun and friendly customer service.  And finally, a little bit more of it will go toward working capital and operating expenses to keep our doors open while we get settled in and get the word out.  
We're so excited to participate in the revitalization of Downtown Akron, and to get you involved in it with us!  We don't want to just set-up shop downtown, we're laying down roots for a shop we hope to be a part of the downtown food scene for years to come.  Downtown already has a lot to offer, but it could be so much more. With recent successful additions to the area including the Nightlight Theater, Nuevo Modern Mexican, Akron Art Walks, and more, your investment in our future is an investment in the future of Akron, by supporting the rebirth of the downtown retail and food scene.To thank you for your support, we have compiled a bunch of exciting reward options we think you'll really like. You'll have an opportunity to taste some of our goodies, sport some Sweet Mary's gear and show your Akron pride, try out some of the amazing Bent Tree Coffee that we'll be featuring, or even hang out with Sweet Mary and create your own specialty cake or pie! (Hugs included.) 




  It Ain't Easy Being Sweet
  It's no secret that the food business is a tough one. There are so many moving parts that unless they're all operating smoothly, things can go sour pretty quickly.  By starting out as a made-to-order business almost nine years ago, Sweet Mary's Bakery has been able to build up a loyal customer base (thank you!!), perfect our recipes and techniques, and solidify our vision. 
We made the big mistakes early, like that three-tier baby shower cake for 35 people that could have fed 150 (Nicole, you know what I'm talking about), or underestimating the value of planning ahead for events, or charging $1 each for a cupcake to be competitive then discovering it costs me more than that to make one.  But the important point is that we've been there, we've done that and we've learned and improved. So now we're READY.
Without showing you all the spreadsheets (and there are spreadsheets. You have no idea.) it's hard to prove to you just how ready we are, unless you've been a customer of ours.  
We've participated in food fairs and other festivals across the area such at Ramp Up Peninsula, the Peninsula Food Fest, the Tribute to the Civic - 80's Party, provided desserts for local organizations like the Summit County Historical Society and the Akron Urban League as well as local restaurants like Edgar's and the Office Bistro.

<h3><b>Hello Everyone,</b></h3>
<br/>My name is Fabrice Serroen. I decided to create a distributorship company called Usofab. I was amazed about USA organic makeup industry. So I decided to import the number one French organic brand, already distributed in 30 countries, but not in the USA : <b>COULEUR CARAMEL</b>.<br/><br/><p><b>We have made some crazy deals for you :<br/></b></p>
<ul>
<li>If your are a woman you will know what i am talking about.</li>
<li>If your are a man, you may be a husband, a son, a father, a grand father, a son in law who wants to get redemption. In that case offer a deal for life to your loved ones. <br/>
</li>
</ul>
<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1401586/files/20150421010604-Capture_d_e_cran_2015-04-20_a__12.19.57.png?1429603564"" src="""" style=""width: 611.487px; height: 431px;""/></p>
<br/><br/>The product is unbelievable. It is a professional makeup. We are partner of the ""<i>Cannes Film Festival</i>"", the official makeup for TV show such as ""<i>Dancing With The Stars</i>"", ""<i>Energy Music Awards</i>"".
 The feedback on the product is amazing.<br/><blockquote>
<b> We believe that everyone should
 have the choice of wearing armless makeup at a reasonnable price.</b><br/>
</blockquote>
<br/><br/>I 
don't want to talk about all the studies made on the makeup. 
But we know now or should i say we don't know how it effects our skin, 
body, pragnant women...<br/><br/><p>Following are some of the chemicals commonly found in cosmetics and what they do to us.</p>
<h3>Phthalates</h3>
<a href=""http://www.breastcancerfund.org/reduce-your-risk/tips/choose-safe-cosmetics/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><p></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.breastcancerfund.org/clear-science/radiation-chemicals-and-breast-cancer/phthalates.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Phthalates</a> are a group of <a href=""http://www.breastcancerfund.org/clear-science/biology-of-breast-cancer/endocrine-disrupting-compounds/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">endocrine-disrupting chemicals</a>
 that are found in cosmetics like <b>nail polish and in synthetic 
fragrance</b>—both perfumes and fragrance ingredients in other cosmetic 
products. Phthalate exposure has been linked to early puberty in girls, a
 risk factor for later-life breast cancer. Some phthalates also act as 
weak <a href=""http://www.breastcancerfund.org/clear-science/biology-of-breast-cancer/endocrine-system/#estrogen"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">estrogens</a> in cell culture systems.</p>
<h3>Triclosan</h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.breastcancerfund.org/clear-science/radiation-chemicals-and-breast-cancer/triclosan.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Triclosan</a>
 is used in <b>antibacterial soaps, deodorants and toothpastes</b> to limit the
 growth of bacteria and mold. The chemical, which is classified as a 
pesticide, can affect the body’s <a href=""http://www.breastcancerfund.org/clear-science/biology-of-breast-cancer/endocrine-system/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">hormone systems</a>—especially
 thyroid hormones, which regulate metabolism—and may disrupt normal 
breast development. Widespread use of triclosan may also contribute to 
bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents.</p>
<h3>1,4-dioxane</h3>
<p>1,4-dioxane is not listed on ingredient labels. It is a 
petroleum-derived contaminant formed in the manufacture of <b>shampoos, 
body wash, children’s bath products and other sudsing cosmetics.</b> The 
International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has ranked it as a 
possible carcinogen, and the National Toxicology Program (NTP) has 
identified it as a reasonably anticipated carcinogen.</p>
<h3>Parabens</h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.breastcancerfund.org/clear-science/radiation-chemicals-and-breast-cancer/parabens.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Parabens</a>
 are a group of compounds widely used as an antifungal agent, 
preservative and antimicrobial in <b>creams, lotions, ointments and other 
cosmetics, including underarm deodorants. </b>They are absorbed through the 
skin and have been identified in biopsy samples from breast tumors.</p>
<h3>Ethylene Oxide</h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.breastcancerfund.org/clear-science/radiation-chemicals-and-breast-cancer/ethylene-oxide.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ethylene oxide</a>
 is used to sterilize surgical instruments. It can also be a contaminant
 of personal care products such as <b>shampoos and body washes</b>, because it 
is used to buffer the harshness of some sudsing agents, and trace 
amounts can be left behind. It is classified as a known human carcinogen
 and is one of 51 chemicals that the National Toxicology Program (NTP) 
identifies as mammary carcinogens in animals.</p>
<h3>1,3-butadiene</h3>
<p><b>Shaving creams, spray sunscreens and foundations, and anti-fungal 
treatments </b>that contain the propellant isobutene may be contaminated 
with the carcinogen <a href=""http://www.breastcancerfund.org/clear-science/radiation-chemicals-and-breast-cancer/1-3-butadiene.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">1,3-butadiene</a>. Exposure occurs mainly through inhalation. This chemical has been found to increase mammary tumors in rodents. </p>
<h3>Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs)</h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.breastcancerfund.org/clear-science/radiation-chemicals-and-breast-cancer/polycyclic-aromatic-hydrocarbons.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons</a>
 (PAHs) are a group of chemicals that occur naturally in coal, crude oil
 and gasoline. One of the more common PAHs is naphthalene<b>. Some 
cosmetics and shampoos</b> are made with coal tar and therefore may contain 
PAHs. They have been shown to increase risk for breast cancer.</p>
<h3>Placental Extract</h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.breastcancerfund.org/clear-science/radiation-chemicals-and-breast-cancer/hormones-in-personal-care.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Placental extract</a>
 is derived from human or animal placentas and is used in<b> hair 
conditioners, shampoos and other grooming aids</b>, particularly those 
marketed to women of color. The National Toxicology Program (NTP) has 
identified progesterone, the major hormonal contaminant in placental 
extracts, as a reasonably anticipated carcinogen.</p>
<h3>Lead</h3>
<p>Lead may be a contaminant in over 650 cosmetic products, including 
<b>sunscreens, foundation, nail colors, lipsticks and whitening toothpaste</b>.
 Lead is a proven neurotoxin, linked to learning, language and 
behavioral problems. It has also been linked to miscarriage, reduced 
fertility in men and women, and delays in puberty onset in girls.</p>
<h3>Sunscreen</h3>
<p>Many <a href=""http://www.breastcancerfund.org/clear-science/radiation-chemicals-and-breast-cancer/sunscreens-uv-filters.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">sunscreens</a> contain chemicals that exert significant estrogenic activity, as measured by the increase in <a href=""http://www.breastcancerfund.org/clear-science/clear-science-glossary.html#proliferation"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">proliferation</a> rates of human breast cancer cells in vitro. Studies show these chemicals are accumulating in wildlife and humans. </p>

<h2>WHY WE NEED YOU</h2>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Our factories are in France and Italy. We 
need a 3 months  stock ahead of us to deliver our clients on time in case any issues happen. 
That also means the more clients we get, bigger our stock needs
 to be. We aim to be in 250 local stores by the end of 2017, that means a
 buffer stock of $500 000 . </p>
<p>We are seeking to raise $150.000 to be 
able to run our stock for the first  year.That will allow us to star the
 business and create the cash flow for the next 2 years.</p>
<p>The next step will be to introduce <i>Couleur Caramel</i> to the national main chains by 2018.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>THE RISKS <br/>
</h2>
<ul>
<li>Some main stores dealing with manufacturer only, in that case Couleur Caramel will deal with them for us</li>
<li>Important stock needed wich means that we can only grow according to the cash flow we can allow to the stock</li>
<li>Standart retailer agreement stipulating terms and conditions advantageous to retailers</li>
</ul>
<p><br/></p>
<h3></h3>
<h2>THE STRENGHTS</h2>
<ul>
<li>Quality : professional make up</li>
<li>Packaging</li>
<li>Niche market with small companies as competitors</li>
<li>ability to create new label to enter different princing tier</li>
</ul>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h2>WHERE WE ARE NOW</h2>
<ul>
<li>We are looking to rent our offices and warehouse in Los Angeles.</li>
<li>We have found  3 local chains ( 36 stores in total) to put our products on shelves in september.</li>
<li>We signed our sole distribution contract with Couleur Caramel. <br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<br/>
</blockquote>
<h2>NEXT STEP TO FULFILLMENT</h2>
<ul>
<li>We are looking to find our manufacturer for our  wooden diplay unit</li>
<li>we are working on our website to launch it in october<br/>
</li>
</ul>

</div></div>","Hello Everyone,
My name is Fabrice Serroen. I decided to create a distributorship company called Usofab. I was amazed about USA organic makeup industry. So I decided to import the number one French organic brand, already distributed in 30 countries, but not in the USA : COULEUR CARAMEL.We have made some crazy deals for you :

If your are a woman you will know what i am talking about.
If your are a man, you may be a husband, a son, a father, a grand father, a son in law who wants to get redemption. In that case offer a deal for life to your loved ones. 



The product is unbelievable. It is a professional makeup. We are partner of the ""Cannes Film Festival"", the official makeup for TV show such as ""Dancing With The Stars"", ""Energy Music Awards"".
 The feedback on the product is amazing.
 We believe that everyone should
 have the choice of wearing armless makeup at a reasonnable price.

I 
don't want to talk about all the studies made on the makeup. 
But we know now or should i say we don't know how it effects our skin, 
body, pragnant women...Following are some of the chemicals commonly found in cosmetics and what they do to us.
Phthalates

Phthalates are a group of endocrine-disrupting chemicals
 that are found in cosmetics like nail polish and in synthetic 
fragrance—both perfumes and fragrance ingredients in other cosmetic 
products. Phthalate exposure has been linked to early puberty in girls, a
 risk factor for later-life breast cancer. Some phthalates also act as 
weak estrogens in cell culture systems.
Triclosan
Triclosan
 is used in antibacterial soaps, deodorants and toothpastes to limit the
 growth of bacteria and mold. The chemical, which is classified as a 
pesticide, can affect the body’s hormone systems—especially
 thyroid hormones, which regulate metabolism—and may disrupt normal 
breast development. Widespread use of triclosan may also contribute to 
bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents.
1,4-dioxane
1,4-dioxane is not listed on ingredient labels. It is a 
petroleum-derived contaminant formed in the manufacture of shampoos, 
body wash, children’s bath products and other sudsing cosmetics. The 
International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has ranked it as a 
possible carcinogen, and the National Toxicology Program (NTP) has 
identified it as a reasonably anticipated carcinogen.
Parabens
Parabens
 are a group of compounds widely used as an antifungal agent, 
preservative and antimicrobial in creams, lotions, ointments and other 
cosmetics, including underarm deodorants. They are absorbed through the 
skin and have been identified in biopsy samples from breast tumors.
Ethylene Oxide
Ethylene oxide
 is used to sterilize surgical instruments. It can also be a contaminant
 of personal care products such as shampoos and body washes, because it 
is used to buffer the harshness of some sudsing agents, and trace 
amounts can be left behind. It is classified as a known human carcinogen
 and is one of 51 chemicals that the National Toxicology Program (NTP) 
identifies as mammary carcinogens in animals.
1,3-butadiene
Shaving creams, spray sunscreens and foundations, and anti-fungal 
treatments that contain the propellant isobutene may be contaminated 
with the carcinogen 1,3-butadiene. Exposure occurs mainly through inhalation. This chemical has been found to increase mammary tumors in rodents. 
Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs)
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
 (PAHs) are a group of chemicals that occur naturally in coal, crude oil
 and gasoline. One of the more common PAHs is naphthalene. Some 
cosmetics and shampoos are made with coal tar and therefore may contain 
PAHs. They have been shown to increase risk for breast cancer.
Placental Extract
Placental extract
 is derived from human or animal placentas and is used in hair 
conditioners, shampoos and other grooming aids, particularly those 
marketed to women of color. The National Toxicology Program (NTP) has 
identified progesterone, the major hormonal contaminant in placental 
extracts, as a reasonably anticipated carcinogen.
Lead
Lead may be a contaminant in over 650 cosmetic products, including 
sunscreens, foundation, nail colors, lipsticks and whitening toothpaste.
 Lead is a proven neurotoxin, linked to learning, language and 
behavioral problems. It has also been linked to miscarriage, reduced 
fertility in men and women, and delays in puberty onset in girls.
Sunscreen
Many sunscreens contain chemicals that exert significant estrogenic activity, as measured by the increase in proliferation rates of human breast cancer cells in vitro. Studies show these chemicals are accumulating in wildlife and humans. 

 WE ARE THE FUTUR OF THE
 MAKEUP INDUSTRY.

WE ARE INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED

Couleur Caramel Values

WHY WE NEED YOU

Our factories are in France and Italy. We 
need a 3 months  stock ahead of us to deliver our clients on time in case any issues happen. 
That also means the more clients we get, bigger our stock needs
 to be. We aim to be in 250 local stores by the end of 2017, that means a
 buffer stock of $500 000 . 
We are seeking to raise $150.000 to be 
able to run our stock for the first  year.That will allow us to star the
 business and create the cash flow for the next 2 years.
The next step will be to introduce Couleur Caramel to the national main chains by 2018.

THE RISKS 


Some main stores dealing with manufacturer only, in that case Couleur Caramel will deal with them for us
Important stock needed wich means that we can only grow according to the cash flow we can allow to the stock
Standart retailer agreement stipulating terms and conditions advantageous to retailers



THE STRENGHTS

Quality : professional make up
Packaging
Niche market with small companies as competitors
ability to create new label to enter different princing tier



WHERE WE ARE NOW

We are looking to rent our offices and warehouse in Los Angeles.
We have found  3 local chains ( 36 stores in total) to put our products on shelves in september.
We signed our sole distribution contract with Couleur Caramel. 






NEXT STEP TO FULFILLMENT

― Christopher McDougall, Born to Run:Hallo, ich bin Sebastian Hallmann und Läufer. Während meines Trainings im Sportpark Hallbergmoos ist mir aufgefallen, dass sich dort praktisch täglich 20 und mehr junge ""Asylbewerber"" (unbegleitete minderjährige Flüchtlinge) aufhalten um dort sportlich ihren Tag zu gestalten oder die Zeit tot zuschlagen.Die jugendlichen wurden aus der Bayernkaserne München nach Hallbergmoos verlegt und warten auf die Abwicklung ihres bürokratischen Verfahrens.Meine Idee ist es, die Jugendlichen von der Straße auf die Laufstrecke zu holen und mit einem Sportprogramm ihre Integration zu unterstützen und mit der örtlichen Bevölkerung in Kontakt zu bringen.In verschiedenen Gesprächen mit den Veranstaltern des Hallbergmooser Volksfestlaufs, einem Gemeinderat und der Administration der Asylbewerberunterkunft kam die Idee, die Jugendlichen in einen Lauftreff zur Vorbereitung auf den Volksfestlauf zu integrieren.

<p><b>Short Summary</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>My name is David Langer; a professional big wave surfer from Maui, and my dream is to ride the biggest waves I have ever seen and bring that experience to viewers at home. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Over the years, some of the most famous big waves have been documented by the surfers who surf them.  Here in the traditional fishing town of Nazaré, Portugal, a sleeping giant has awoken - and it’s only proper that we greet her accordingly.  To do this, my team and fellow athletes have a plan to showcase the beauty of big wave surfing at Nazaré, and your help would be crucial to our success.  Not that it hasn't already started, it's just the beginning is all.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Inspired by Nelson Mandela and his statement, “Sports have the power to change the world.”, I believe that we can use the sport of big wave surfing to open people's minds to the power of the ocean and the athletes that choose to face it. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>My campaign here in Nazaré is important to me for a few reasons: The first being safety. Much like a race team in the world of motorsports, we need to be as safe and organized as possible while pushing the limits of this fairly new sport. Second, there is a crew of talented individuals who are not only rooting me on, but working to make this dream a reality. These individuals are my teammates, and as such, need to be paid for their efforts in helping me to achieve this dream. The third reason why this project is so important to me is that it will help to attract corporate sponsorship once the team is established, thanks to your contributions. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The magnitude of accomplishing this task is huge in that it will push the world of surfing as we know it. Due to the serious risks that encompass this sport, the rewards for achieving the goals of riding a wave this size and documenting it for future generations of big wave surfers, are tremendous. We are at the cutting edge of action sports, and your contribution can be the fuel to lighting the fire in making it happen. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>

Or better yet, two Quadskis - as they would be more effective, safer, and a much better marketing tool to attract attention to this ever growing sport. Not only does this price reflect the cost of equipment, but also the shipping and taxes of these products from Michigan to Portugal. </p>
<p>3. To cover the costs of a warehouse to store the equipment, gas to fuel it, plane tickets, and accommodation during the five month wave season in Nazaré, plus any other expenses including (yet not limited to) promotional and marketing efforts or other unforeseen expenses, we are aiming to raise $18,000. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Of course, this is just our goal for the first season of documenting Nazaré, with hopes to increase awareness in the years to come. Our projections require a goal of raising $450,000 USD, which would be used towards:</p>
<p>1. Creating a surf academy, where we will give youth the training tools they need to surf and perform water safety in big waves. </p>

Short Summary


My name is David Langer; a professional big wave surfer from Maui, and my dream is to ride the biggest waves I have ever seen and bring that experience to viewers at home. 


Over the years, some of the most famous big waves have been documented by the surfers who surf them.  Here in the traditional fishing town of Nazaré, Portugal, a sleeping giant has awoken - and it’s only proper that we greet her accordingly.  To do this, my team and fellow athletes have a plan to showcase the beauty of big wave surfing at Nazaré, and your help would be crucial to our success.  Not that it hasn't already started, it's just the beginning is all.


Inspired by Nelson Mandela and his statement, “Sports have the power to change the world.”, I believe that we can use the sport of big wave surfing to open people's minds to the power of the ocean and the athletes that choose to face it.

We are at the cutting edge of action sports, and your contribution can be the fuel to lighting the fire in making it happen.

The Impact


This project will change the world and the people responsible for making this change will get to take that credit with them into their personal and professional lives. 
By documenting this wave and the risk takers who challenge it, we will be impacting the future of our sport and pushing the limits in creating timeless wonder for all those involved. 


Risks & Challenges


I have been sponsored for fifteen years as a professional athlete. The first for five years as a downhill mountain biker, and now for the past ten years as a professional tow  surfer. 
Through this passion to succeed, companies like Coca Cola and Kraft Foods have taken risks in sponsoring me and have benefitted greatly. However, I am now ready to take the personal risk in surfing the biggest wave in the world and to represent new companies who are willing to invest in extreme projects such as this. 


Big wave surfing creates a focus unlike any other; however, as waves of this magnitude only break during certain times of the year and almost always in far and exotic locations, it is difficult for big wave surfers to travel from one swell to the next without proper sponsorship.

<p>I created the website <a href=""http://www.mylifeafterdivorce.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.mylifeafterdivorce.com</a> to do just that, to help both men and women navigate the divorce process and cope better with their new and unfamiliar life after divorce.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The site deals openly and honestly with all aspects of divorce from legal and financial matters, through new relationships to the many aspects of everyday life which can be difficult for the newly single.</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">     </span><br/></p>
<p>The advice is honest, straight forward and authoritative.  It is accompanied by numerous links to other trusted specialist websites who have particular expertise in the subject being discussed.</p>
<p>Nearly half of all marriages and long term relationships end in breakdown.  This leaves a trail of damaged lives and broken families.</p>
<p>With your support we can continue to expand what we can do to help divorced people achieve a better life. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>
<p>We need to raise £7,000 to achieve a number of things.  Firstly we will carry out further research into the causes of the downgrade to our search engine ranking produced by changes Google has made to their search algorithms.  We are not alone as these changes are having dramatic effects upon the rankings of many websites both large and small.</p>
<p>Like them we must have a clear understanding of the causes so we can make the necessary adaptations to take into account these algorithm changes.  This will be vital element in returning us to our previous high search engine rankings.  This work is budgeted at £2,000.</p>
<p>We will then build upon this to maintain these crucial search engine ranking and so return the site to its former status of the website of choice for divorced people.  This will be achieved by effective Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) involving the development of further unique forms of content and a new Social Media strategy with a more interactive implementation.  This work is budgeted at £2,500 </p>
<p>As soon as we have completed this vital work we will continue the work we have started in preparing a US version of the site.  This will be our next key objective to bring a straight forward, unbiased, optimistic source of support and help to the divorced community in the United States.  This will take time but then we can look towards helping people in Australia, Canada and other English speaking countries.  </p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The problems of relationship breakdown are universal so almost all of our content will need only simple adjustment to make it appropriate for US visitors.  The legal information and advice will require complete overhaul to reflect the US divorce laws which are peculiar to individual states.  This work is budgeted at £2,500.</span></p>
<p>Your contributions are crucial and will allow us to reach a wider audience and give more help and support to people and families at a very difficult and critical time in their lives.  To thank you for your help and support we would like to offer you a small token of our appreciation for your kindness and generosity.</p>
<p>We have thought a lot about this.  Most perks are gifts of the product or service that the funds are being raised to produce.  That's difficult for us as everything we create is freely available on the website.  After much thought we had a great idea - 'decision' dice.</p>
<p>Life is full of important decisions whether you are single, married, in a partnership or, yes divorced.  Making these decisions is so much easier with advice and support.  That's the real help we offer divorced people but just for the light hearted fun of it you could role our <span style=""background-color: initial;"">specially designed 'decision' dice and there you have it, the answer.  No more stress!</span></p>

</div>

</div></div>","Short Summary My name is Nick Webbe.  I was divorced a few years ago.  It was a bad time.  As I struggled with the emotional and practical difficulties I thought about how I could help others in the same circumstances.  Then I wanted to help them to rebuild and make the transition to a better and more fulfilling life. 
I created the website www.mylifeafterdivorce.com to do just that, to help both men and women navigate the divorce process and cope better with their new and unfamiliar life after divorce.
The site deals openly and honestly with all aspects of divorce from legal and financial matters, through new relationships to the many aspects of everyday life which can be difficult for the newly single.     
The advice is honest, straight forward and authoritative.  It is accompanied by numerous links to other trusted specialist websites who have particular expertise in the subject being discussed.
Nearly half of all marriages and long term relationships end in breakdown.  This leaves a trail of damaged lives and broken families.
With your support we can continue to expand what we can do to help divorced people achieve a better life. 


What We Need & What You Get

We need to raise £7,000 to achieve a number of things.  Firstly we will carry out further research into the causes of the downgrade to our search engine ranking produced by changes Google has made to their search algorithms.  We are not alone as these changes are having dramatic effects upon the rankings of many websites both large and small.
Like them we must have a clear understanding of the causes so we can make the necessary adaptations to take into account these algorithm changes.  This will be vital element in returning us to our previous high search engine rankings.  This work is budgeted at £2,000.
We will then build upon this to maintain these crucial search engine ranking and so return the site to its former status of the website of choice for divorced people.  This will be achieved by effective Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) involving the development of further unique forms of content and a new Social Media strategy with a more interactive implementation.  This work is budgeted at £2,500 
As soon as we have completed this vital work we will continue the work we have started in preparing a US version of the site.  This will be our next key objective to bring a straight forward, unbiased, optimistic source of support and help to the divorced community in the United States.  This will take time but then we can look towards helping people in Australia, Canada and other English speaking countries.  
The problems of relationship breakdown are universal so almost all of our content will need only simple adjustment to make it appropriate for US visitors.  The legal information and advice will require complete overhaul to reflect the US divorce laws which are peculiar to individual states.  This work is budgeted at £2,500.
Your contributions are crucial and will allow us to reach a wider audience and give more help and support to people and families at a very difficult and critical time in their lives.  To thank you for your help and support we would like to offer you a small token of our appreciation for your kindness and generosity.
We have thought a lot about this.  Most perks are gifts of the product or service that the funds are being raised to produce.  That's difficult for us as everything we create is freely available on the website.  After much thought we had a great idea - 'decision' dice.
Life is full of important decisions whether you are single, married, in a partnership or, yes divorced.  Making these decisions is so much easier with advice and support.  That's the real help we offer divorced people but just for the light hearted fun of it you could role our specially designed 'decision' dice and there you have it, the answer.  No more stress!
    
The Impact


The breakdown of marriages and long term relationships shows no sign of a decline and could affect half of us during the course of our lives.  Unfortunately the chance of breakdown ending a second marriage is even greater.  
The need for realistic and  straight forward advice and support plus easy access to serious professional help will always be there.  Our goal is to make a difference to people's lives, to make divorced people happier and better able to make the transition to their new life.
Risks & Challenges

The major challenge for the site is to re-establish the high search engine rankings to deliver the visitor levels we achieved before the adverse algorithm changes.  We have budgeted a modest monthly expenditure to do this in the long term.  As visitor numbers increase the revenue aspects of the site will generate the funds to finance these costs.

<h3>                                    The Problem </h3>
<p>  Every 5 minutes, over 2 million plastic water bottles are sold
 in the US alone, and many bottled water companies rake in 280,000% 
profit. Many of these plastic bottles are getting into the waterways of the planet. Bottled water cost 2000 times more than tap water, has a high 
level of Oxidation Reduction Potential (O.R.P), is acidic, low in 
conductivity, electrons, magnetism, oxygen, and hydrogen, and lacks a balance
 of ionic trace minerals. This is why 95% of people are dehydrated, and even those drinking plenty of water are experiencing dehydration 
symptoms. Most people are not efficiently and effectively getting nutrients into their cells and flushing out toxins due to lack of good 
quality water.                </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>                                    The Solution 

</h3>
<p>  We live in a time when nearly every problem has a solution. If we 
invest in a good quality water filter to remove physical 
contaminants, half of the job is done. Then we add quality ionic trace 
minerals, use the natural water activation (<b>Vortex Magnetic 
Energizer Kit)</b> to remove vibrational contaminants and to restructure and 
energize our drinking water.</p>
<p> For a small investment, 10-15 cents per 
gallon, you can transform bottled and tap water to<i><b> full-spectrum living water</b></i>  with
 balanced levels of minerals, hydrogen, oxygen, electrons, 
conductivity, and pH. <br/></p>

<p>   This simple tool satisfies three of the four elements
required for the creation of <em>full-spectrum, living water</em>.  As its
name indicates, the Vortex Magnetic Energizer creates a vortex while water passes
through a field-reversing magnetic array and Harmony Ring. Within minutes, it
transforms lifeless water into full-spectrum, living water. <a href=""http://www.dancingwithwater.com/the-new-science-of-water/what-is-full-spectrum-living-water/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><em><br/></em></a>
</p>
<p>The process causes water dipoles to align/realign, creating greater
molecular organization and restoring the water’s liquid crystalline
state. The significance of this simple process (passing through the combination of vortex, reversing
magnetic field, and Harmony Ring) is becoming well recognized. Research shows that the structure of water is more important than its chemical composition.     </p>

Evidence of the Vortex Effect<br/></i></h3>

<h4> <i>""Comprehend nature, then copy nature."" -Viktor Schauberger</i><br/>
</h4>
<p>  The qualities of vortex water were best described by Viktor Schauberger, a brilliant Austrian inventor and naturalist, in the book <i>Living Energies</i>. He established evidence of the vast difference between ""dead water"" and ""living water."" Dead water is still water, such as bottled, tap, or distilled. Living water, he taught, is like the water found in springs and rivers that forms spirals as it flows. This causes higher zeta potentials (life force) ionization, oxygenation, hydrogen, electrons, and also kills parasites and bacteria.  <br/></p>
<p> Further research was recently conducted by Dr. Mu Shik Jhon of Korea. He showed that in a vortex the inner layers of water flow much faster than the outer layers, and that the velocity at the center of the vortex is infinite. The hydrogen bonds in the water molecules begin to stretch as layers expand and contract. This opens the molecular structure of water for a constant interchange and exchange of electrons. As hexagonal structuring increases, the water's ability to carry vibrations and frequency also increases. Dr. Jhon's 30 years of research on water was compiled in his book <i>The Water Puzzle and the Hexagonal Key: Scientific Evidence of Hexagonal Water and its positive influence on health!<b> </b></i> <a href=""http://www.vibrantvitalwater.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><br/></a></p>

<h3>
<i>     Scientific
Evidence of the Magnetic Effect</i>
</h3>
<p> The use of
magnetism to revitalize and purify water is not new. Ancient Romans were among
the first to utilize the Earth’s magnetic properties with their system of aqueducts,
designed to purify and energize water. Some recent innovators have confirmed
the health benefits of magnetic therapies and uses, including Dr. Mu Shik Jhon, Johann Grander, and Walter Rawls, Jr. Ph.D., as well as Dr. Gerhard Pioch.<br/>
<br/> Dr. Gerhard Pioch discovered that chemical wastes in the body can be washed out by
using magnetically treated water. Contaminants deposited into the body, such as
medications, fertilizers, food-borne chemicals, pesticides (including traces of
DDT), and heavy metals can be neutralized by the magnetized water treatments. </p>Other research revealed:<br/><ol>

<h3>                               Harmony Rings<br/>
</h3>
<p><strong> </strong> Origi<em>nally discovered by Slim Spurling in the 1980s </em>and known as <em>Tensor Rings</em>, Harmony Rings have a
powerful effect on water and on living biology.<strong> </strong>In addition to their effects on water, Tensor Rings have been
used to augment plant growth and vitality, to reduce pain and inflammation, and hasten healing. <br/></p>
<p> In testing, demonstrated effects on water include increased vitality, a change from acid to neutral or slightly alkaline pH, and allowing better oxygen/nutrient/waste transport in and out of cells. Plants given this water appear to be taller and more lush, have larger leaves, and are less attacked by pests.                                                 <br/></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong></p>
<h3><strong>                             How Does It Work?</strong></h3> 

Water
is energized by movement and by turbulence. When water moves, it 
naturally spirals, breaking away from each obstacle with a spin (vortex). As
water spirals through the VME,
groupings of unorganized water molecules break apart and realign again and
again, generating the repeating matrix known as structured or liquid crystalline
water. <br/><br/>Each time the water spins through the magnetic array, a greater degree
of coherence is established. When the water stops, the geometric pattern (water’s organized
molecular structure) remains. Rare earth elements such as Shungite and ANCHI Crystals will amplify this structure-generating process.<br/><br/><br/><h3>      What other products will be coming soon?</h3>

   The vortex, or spiral, is the underlying pattern
which permeates our universe; the pattern formed by two opposing forces is made
visible in the substance of water. All life moves between two polarities;
without opposite poles there can be no attraction and no repulsion. Without
attraction and repulsion, there can be no movement, and without movement, no
life.<br/> All that lives moves between an upward spiral - levitation energy, creating growth and purification, and the downward spiral - gravity degeneration towards death. In nature both forces always work in
cooperation with one another, creating balance. <p><br/></p>

<p> The vortex action of water (implosion) produces
electricity and has been measured in lab tests. This is a complex interplay of
""vibration,"" ""direction,"" and ""force,"" each balanced both internally and externally. Humanity has lived for so
long under the spell of reductive science that it now requires totally new ways
of understanding and perceiving in order to come to terms with the existence
and power of this energy.</p>

Water is a network of
hydrogen-bonded molecules. It can form various structures, depending on how the
individual molecules bond together. The most recent scientific
findings indicate that biological organisms prefer the six-sided (hexagonal)
ring-structure, found in spring water.

<p>  This Hexagonal water forms a
liquid crystalline lattice that is involved in cellular communication,
intracellular water movement, enzyme function, and many other metabolic
processes. The amount of Hexagonal water in the body has been correlated
with aging. It has also been found to form the initial layer of water
surrounding healthy cells. On the other hand, unorganized water has been described
surrounding diseased and abnormal cells.<br/></p>

<p> Dehydration is the number one
cause of stress in the human body. It has been linked with heartburn, headaches, angina
pain, asthma, colitis, diabetes, peptic ulcer pain, high blood pressure, low back

 The most recent scientific findings
indicate that water forms 3 distinct layers surrounding healthy cells. In
healthy tissues, full-spectrum, living water is closely associated with cell membranes,
forming the first layer. On the other hand, the initial layer surrounding
diseased cells is unorganized water. Full-spectrum, living water is also
found in close association with normal, healthy DNA, while abnormal DNA is
associated with unorganized water.

</div></div>","Who We Are
  Vibrant Vital Water was established by founder Randy Hatton in 1999. Randy started commercial fishing with his father at an early age and at 26 became captain of a 175 foot catcher/processor fishing vessel in the Bering Sea.                                   
  Randy became aware of and concerned about the amount of chemicals and garbage entering the oceans, rivers, and lakes. At age 33, he quit his lifelong commercial fishing career to dedicate his life to coming up with solutions to these problems.   Randy has spent the last 15 years researching the properties of water, experimenting with and testing the effects of different treatment systems on it. He integrated the information, developing leading edge
technologies to improve the physical and bio-energetic
qualities of planetary water preserves. He established Vibrant Vital Water, a company with a small scale operation making all the products below. To help support our environmental concerns we must take production to the next level on all 4 systems, starting with the Vortex Magnetic Energizer. We have been issued 3 patents with 2 pending. Randy's vision is to create sustainable community-based businesses where 10% of profits go towards Project Clean Oceans Inc., a 501(c)(3) non-profit.
                What We Need and What You Get
  






  We need at least $90,000 to make 2,500 Vortex Magnetic Energizer 
(VME) kits. Donations and sales from the perks will pay for tooling,
 materials, labor and packaging for 2,500 VME kits. The VME's and Harmony 
Rings will be handmade, with Love and Integrity, creating jobs for 
people not machines. 
               

                      Vortex Magnetic Energizer 

               The VME kits and other perks offered are the simplest and most affordable way to transform your drinking water. For a detailed description and research about the   VME, Harmony Rings and other perks offered, visit our website and click on products.  http://www.vibrantvitalwater.com/vme.htm   
   
     
 The VME, along with the limited edition Gaia's Fountain and Artesia, are highlighted in the book Dancing With Water: The New Science of Water. It 
explains how and why each of the water technologies/perks that we offer really work.

  These technologies are all about revitalizing,
renewing, and preserving earth's most precious and vital resource: Water. By supporting this campaign you will be supporting better health for 
You, your Family, your Environment, and all Beings for future generations.


                                    The Problem 
  Every 5 minutes, over 2 million plastic water bottles are sold
 in the US alone, and many bottled water companies rake in 280,000% 
profit. Many of these plastic bottles are getting into the waterways of the planet. Bottled water cost 2000 times more than tap water, has a high 
level of Oxidation Reduction Potential (O.R.P), is acidic, low in 
conductivity, electrons, magnetism, oxygen, and hydrogen, and lacks a balance
 of ionic trace minerals. This is why 95% of people are dehydrated, and even those drinking plenty of water are experiencing dehydration 
symptoms. Most people are not efficiently and effectively getting nutrients into their cells and flushing out toxins due to lack of good 
quality water.                

                                    The Solution 


  We live in a time when nearly every problem has a solution. If we 
invest in a good quality water filter to remove physical 
contaminants, half of the job is done. Then we add quality ionic trace 
minerals, use the natural water activation (Vortex Magnetic 
Energizer Kit) to remove vibrational contaminants and to restructure and 
energize our drinking water.
 For a small investment, 10-15 cents per 
gallon, you can transform bottled and tap water to full-spectrum living water  with
 balanced levels of minerals, hydrogen, oxygen, electrons, 
conductivity, and pH. 
                       ""Vortex Magnetic Energizer"" 

          
   This simple tool satisfies three of the four elements
required for the creation of full-spectrum, living water.  As its
name indicates, the Vortex Magnetic Energizer creates a vortex while water passes
through a field-reversing magnetic array and Harmony Ring. Within minutes, it
transforms lifeless water into full-spectrum, living water. 

The process causes water dipoles to align/realign, creating greater
molecular organization and restoring the water’s liquid crystalline
state. The significance of this simple process (passing through the combination of vortex, reversing
magnetic field, and Harmony Ring) is becoming well recognized. Research shows that the structure of water is more important than its chemical composition.     

          Scientific
Evidence of the Vortex Effect            

 ""Comprehend nature, then copy nature."" -Viktor Schauberger

  The qualities of vortex water were best described by Viktor Schauberger, a brilliant Austrian inventor and naturalist, in the book Living Energies. He established evidence of the vast difference between ""dead water"" and ""living water."" Dead water is still water, such as bottled, tap, or distilled. Living water, he taught, is like the water found in springs and rivers that forms spirals as it flows. This causes higher zeta potentials (life force) ionization, oxygenation, hydrogen, electrons, and also kills parasites and bacteria.  
 Further research was recently conducted by Dr. Mu Shik Jhon of Korea. He showed that in a vortex the inner layers of water flow much faster than the outer layers, and that the velocity at the center of the vortex is infinite. The hydrogen bonds in the water molecules begin to stretch as layers expand and contract. This opens the molecular structure of water for a constant interchange and exchange of electrons. As hexagonal structuring increases, the water's ability to carry vibrations and frequency also increases. Dr. Jhon's 30 years of research on water was compiled in his book The Water Puzzle and the Hexagonal Key: Scientific Evidence of Hexagonal Water and its positive influence on health!  




     Scientific
Evidence of the Magnetic Effect

 The use of
magnetism to revitalize and purify water is not new. Ancient Romans were among
the first to utilize the Earth’s magnetic properties with their system of aqueducts,
designed to purify and energize water. Some recent innovators have confirmed
the health benefits of magnetic therapies and uses, including Dr. Mu Shik Jhon, Johann Grander, and Walter Rawls, Jr. Ph.D., as well as Dr. Gerhard Pioch.
 Dr. Gerhard Pioch discovered that chemical wastes in the body can be washed out by
using magnetically treated water. Contaminants deposited into the body, such as
medications, fertilizers, food-borne chemicals, pesticides (including traces of
DDT), and heavy metals can be neutralized by the magnetized water treatments. Other research revealed:
Increase
     in hydrogen ion activity
Decrease
     in water weight 

Decrease
     in quantity of nitrogen dissolved in water
Increase
     in the number of crystallization center




                               Harmony Rings

  Originally discovered by Slim Spurling in the 1980s and known as Tensor Rings, Harmony Rings have a
powerful effect on water and on living biology. In addition to their effects on water, Tensor Rings have been
used to augment plant growth and vitality, to reduce pain and inflammation, and hasten healing. 
 In testing, demonstrated effects on water include increased vitality, a change from acid to neutral or slightly alkaline pH, and allowing better oxygen/nutrient/waste transport in and out of cells. Plants given this water appear to be taller and more lush, have larger leaves, and are less attacked by pests.                                                 

                             How Does It Work? 

Water
is energized by movement and by turbulence. When water moves, it 
naturally spirals, breaking away from each obstacle with a spin (vortex). As
water spirals through the VME,
groupings of unorganized water molecules break apart and realign again and
again, generating the repeating matrix known as structured or liquid crystalline
water. Each time the water spins through the magnetic array, a greater degree
of coherence is established. When the water stops, the geometric pattern (water’s organized
molecular structure) remains. Rare earth elements such as Shungite and ANCHI Crystals will amplify this structure-generating process.      What other products will be coming soon?
                          ""Varuna""
    Designed for medium/small volumes of full-spectrum, living water                
                  ""Gaia's Fountain""  
          Designed for larger volumes of full-spectrum, living water

     
   The vortex, or spiral, is the underlying pattern
which permeates our universe; the pattern formed by two opposing forces is made
visible in the substance of water. All life moves between two polarities;
without opposite poles there can be no attraction and no repulsion. Without
attraction and repulsion, there can be no movement, and without movement, no
life. All that lives moves between an upward spiral - levitation energy, creating growth and purification, and the downward spiral - gravity degeneration towards death. In nature both forces always work in
cooperation with one another, creating balance. 
                    
 The vortex action of water (implosion) produces
electricity and has been measured in lab tests. This is a complex interplay of
""vibration,"" ""direction,"" and ""force,"" each balanced both internally and externally. Humanity has lived for so
long under the spell of reductive science that it now requires totally new ways
of understanding and perceiving in order to come to terms with the existence
and power of this energy.
                                                   
                                          ""Artesia""                   

           An integrated system for functional art, pools & spas,                   

           hydroponics, agriculture, aquaculture, rivers and lakes
                             

   

Water is a network of
hydrogen-bonded molecules. It can form various structures, depending on how the
individual molecules bond together. The most recent scientific
findings indicate that biological organisms prefer the six-sided (hexagonal)
ring-structure, found in spring water.




 

  This Hexagonal water forms a
liquid crystalline lattice that is involved in cellular communication,
intracellular water movement, enzyme function, and many other metabolic
processes. The amount of Hexagonal water in the body has been correlated
with aging. It has also been found to form the initial layer of water
surrounding healthy cells. On the other hand, unorganized water has been described
surrounding diseased and abnormal cells.
                                

               ""Artesia"" Pool & Spa 

 Dehydration is the number one
cause of stress in the human body. It has been linked with heartburn, headaches, angina
pain, asthma, colitis, diabetes, peptic ulcer pain, high blood pressure, low back
pain, blood cholesterol, and many other symptoms. In fact,
it is not just the overall lack of water, but specifically the lack of hydrogen and oxygen found in full-spectrum, living water,
which is now being correlated with disease.
          


 The most recent scientific findings
indicate that water forms 3 distinct layers surrounding healthy cells. In
healthy tissues, full-spectrum, living water is closely associated with cell membranes,
forming the first layer. On the other hand, the initial layer surrounding
diseased cells is unorganized water. Full-spectrum, living water is also
found in close association with normal, healthy DNA, while abnormal DNA is
associated with unorganized water. 


       

              Artesia - Hydroponics               
           


        

          Substantial difference in plant and vegetable growth rate,                     potency and size when using full-spectrum, living water.


             The Environmental Problems
  The plastic pollution of our oceans is becoming a situation that must be addressed. The governments of the world are turning their heads away from this most serious problem. 200 millions of tons of plastics have entered the world's oceans; an estimated 8 million tons of plastic enters them each year. 

      
       This Whale had over 20 kilos (44 lbs.) of plastic in its stomach.

   Some plastics take 400 to 700 years to decompose (it's not known exactly 
how long), yet some eventually sinks to the bottom. Every year over 1 
million sea birds and 100,000 marine animals - Turtles, Dolphins, Whales -
 die from plastic ingestion.
  

                     In some of the 5 major Gyres of the world,        
          there's over 100 x more plastic particles than plankton.




 Toxic chemicals (including PCBs and DDTs) are absorbed by the plastics, increasing the toxic concentration a million times. Lantern fish along with many other species of fish in the oceans are eating this plastic, thinking it's food.   
    

 After entering the food chain, these persistent organic pollutants bio-accumulate throughout the food chain. Health effects linked to these chemicals include cancer, malformation, and impaired reproductive ability. Biologist are finding that some species of baby male fish are reverting to female due to high levels of estrogen in their systems. Plastic pollution is also a carrier of invasive species, threatening the native ecosystems.

It is based on water conservation methods by burying wood under the soil mounds that will break down during the years, feeding the soil and acting as a water reserve for the plants above the ground.What the CSA will offer:-Biodynamic grown fresh and dried herbs, vegetables, mushrooms and fruits locally, with an optional mail option for dried herbs and mushrooms, seeds and on the farm produced oils and tinctures.-Locally produced seeds from plants that were grown from Strictly Medicinal Seeds, Siskiyou Seeds, both Oregon seed companies.-Farm visits with basket herb & flower picking for families with children as a wholesome family activity. Members can choose to walk the herb gardens and pick their own herbs and/or receive a CSA box of herbs & more at harvest times. Members and the public can pick up tinctures, infused olive/coconut oils, dried herbs/teas, free samples, newsletter, wish list/suggestions for future herbs/veggies/fruit/flowers to grow.-Worm compost will be also available.-And from the second year honey from the bees on the farm.The actual map of the farm:You can find more information about us, daily updates and progress on our Facebook page @ https://m.facebook.com/hugelwarriors/ and Kati's website @ http://Katalinpazmandi.com.Please check the exciting perks, what you will get back for your contribution on this project.

<p><i><b>Für unsere Deutschsprachigen Freunde... ganz unten... ;-)</b></i></p>
<p>2400km further would u come...<br/> U would save 240l of Diesel...<br/> And save 384.- on a trip of 8000km!!!<br/> With 420kg. functionel and aerodynamics lighter the driving pleasure and the Off-Road capability is mind blowing...<br/> Is this benefit enough 4 u?<br/> Than have a look...<br/> Team Tough Bone<br/></p>
<h3>The Idea</h3>
Lightweight off-road vehicles take you further. Rally vehicles prove it: <b>Weight is crucial. </b>That makes the vehicle suitable for all kinds of terrain and resource-saving. We have applied that principle to travel vehicles and we have even gone one step further: <b>Wherever it is possible, one component should have several functions. </b>
<br/>In that way, we provide:<ul>
<li>Savings in weight, material and money<br/>
</li>
<li>Healthy and environment-friendly progress</li>
<li>Multifunctionality</li>
<li>More pleasant driving and greater off-road capability</li>
<li>An economic and ecological path</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Concept</h3>Our innovative approach saves 400kg of unnecessary load in off-road vehicles! We pay special attention to the construction, i.e. to what is installed, who installs it and in what way. This results in lightweight construction-elements, which are usable and functional several times. Through the selected route, we will show that this concept works<b>. <br/></b><b>LET`S DO SOME EPIC SHIT...</b> because the solution is already there!<br/><br/><h3>The Goals: </h3>
<b>1.   To raise 120,000.-- Doller</b> and make the Concept Car ""Tough Bone Defender"" suitable for exhibition, in order to attain the production stage and prepare the vehicle for our expeditions. <br/><b>2.   It shall be exhibited at:</b><br/><ul>

<p>The idea and the concept are trendy. For that reason, we should be able to meet the demands for healthier and easier traveling. We work with partners and people, who equally have rethinking in their heart. Another challenge is the production of materials that cannot be always made as environmentally friendly as we would like. We are striving to give our best for the environment and to become even better, because we are involved in other projects related to health and environmental issues.</p>

<h3><b>Tough Bone</b></h3>Tough Bone Tuning Solution is a young, freaky garage workshop, which was proudly inscribed at the Commercial Register in June 2013. We manufacture functional lightweight structures on off-road vehicles. Our field of specialization includes the manufacture of carbon-made components in serial, individual and special production, as well as the installation of polycarbonate disks, solar systems, lithium batteries and sophisticated interior fittings made of carbon and Cordura. We work with guys and girls who identify 100% with the project. Our concept breathes of our love for engines and diesel, the wind, many off-road miles, observations on off-road vehicles and, last but not least, our experience in the racing field. So we know what we are talking about… ;-)<br/><b>IT`S A PLAYGROUND 4 BAD-ASS WARRIORS...<br/><br/></b><h3>The man behind it</h3>

Sisley Kaltenbach - A man full of vision and thirst for action. The life of Sisley has always been characterized by the spirit of adventure, the desire for extreme situations and the struggle for the achievement of physical and sport goals. His body, will and mental forced have been sharpened, steeled and formed by more than 15 years of experience as a professional athlete, during which he won several Swiss, European and World titles of snowboard, mountain bike, strainflex, Ju Jitsu and Karate, as well as by 15 years as High-Risk level bodyguard, in the service of renamed people from show business, economics and politics. During this time, Sisley coached several Olympic champions, World Cup participants and professional athletes. His adventurous spirit led him to all corners of the world as an athlete and a professional. The accumulated experience made Sisley a Survival Freak with comprehensive and tactic vision. His motivation is to find adventure even in the smallest things. His vision is to bring his way of life closer to people and to pass it on. Besides Tough Bone, he also owns the companies Face Line and Seal Tac Functional Coaching. Sisley`s unusual everyday winter activities consist not only in skiing, but also in teaching snowboard lessons, traveling through the Haute Route from Zermatt to Chamonix and climbing high mountains, such as Mont Blanc. In summer, surfing, survival training and personal care have priority. From time to time, he may also participate in an Ironman. Given that he enjoys life with nature and the environment as his permanent companions, he created the super cool Sea2Mountain Label, by which he deals with the issue of waste mountains and the way to decimate them. His life motto is:<br/><b>BE THAT KIND OF PERSON WHEN YOUR FEET HIT THE FLOOR EACH MORNING THE DEVIL SAYS „OH CRAP…“</b><br/>Sisley Kaltenbach<br/>The Dude<br/><br/><h3>Land Rover Defender 110 TD5</h3>

<p>The Defender is cult! A myth that makes you dream of freedom. We introduced our Tough Bone Concept Car in 2014 and 2015, together with the first innovative lightweight elements, at the exposition ""Adventures and 4-Wheel Entertainment"" in Bad Kissingen. The Defender made a monstrous impression! The reaction of professionals, visitors and the media was huge. The enhancement of the Defenders with carbon elements lithium batteries and polycarbonate offers unparalleled opportunities as a ""light-version"", which represents an absolute novelty in the Off-Road general market. With this idea, it is possible to serve three markets, the luxury, expedition and rally segments. It is an off-road travel vehicle that has no equal.</p>
<h3>Why do we need a lightweight construction? </h3>
<p>Weight is decisive for the use, performance, comfort, autonomy and wear of Off-Roaders. By using a functional lightweight structure, we achieve less material-entrainment and fuel consumption, lower material wear, increased off-road capability, greater range, higher load capacity, a more economical power delivery and better driving characteristics, combined with perfect design. That is the dream of every Off-Roader.</p>
<h3>Material</h3>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434834609/aq4dbc3xgyq1wqtzfhtt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p>When choosing materials, Carbon presents outstanding properties. By ""carbon"" we mean a carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic. It combines the properties of titanium and aluminum in many of our components. Therefore, we rely on this powerful and versatile raw material. Carbon, offers opportunities that could not be reached totally or partially with the materials used until now. It is extremely light, durable, resistant to external influences and individually adjustable. That means that it can be produced at will as malleable, slip-resistant, puncture-resistant, smooth or extremely resilient. It is no longer possible to imagine technical excellence without carbon.</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<b>A walkable and loadable roof:</b> Normally, the roof is equipped with an aluminum checker plate or with a roof rack. A carbon element reduces greatly the overall weight. Due to this weight decrease, the center of gravity is set lower, which is a huge advantage for all types of vehicles, especially for off-road vehicles. Aerodynamics do not change; there is no noise and huge quantities of fuel are saved. <br/><b>Windows and doors: </b>Glass panels and inner parts are replaced with carbon or other polycarbonate. The plates are enormously resistant to puncture, impact and abrasion. They cannot be dented and offer visual and sun protection. The Carbon door panels save weight and generate new storage space outside.<br/><b>Chassis parts:</b> Hoods, doors, roof and side panels usually have large areas, which are heavy and corrode. Thanks to the use of lightweight carbon fiber, corrosion is something that belongs to the past. In addition to that, the center of gravity of the vehicle is greatly lowered towards the floor what the off-road capability, which hugely improves off-road capability and agility.<br/><b>Underbody protection and bottom plate:</b> The metal plates used until now are heavy and may corrode. Carbon, however, is much lighter and does not corrode, which is a great advantage during expeditions. The panels are largely resistant to puncture, impact and abrasion. Metal is formed by beating. After exposure to a load, carbon resumes its original shape.<br/><b>Interior: </b>Every interior is a matter of taste and it is individually adjusted. With the help of carbon, a car can be made luxurious or practical. The nice surface appearance of the material and its design possibilities make any coating unnecessary. <br/><b>Technical parts of the chassis and engine: </b>In particular, moving and rotating parts follow the principle of mass and inertia. The lighter they are, the faster they accelerate or decelerate. When moving and rotating, heavy components are sluggishly. Light parts make the vehicle agile, lively and powerful. In that way, the wear of parts is significantly reduced.<br/><br/><h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>We can come up with a clear and visible concept and get started. Do you find this idea supercool? Check out our perks and tell your friends and fellows about them. Post as many of them as you can and wish - anywhere.</p>
<p><b>I count on you, make it happen… ;-)</b></p>
<h3>Summary of costs:</h3>
<b>Tough Bone elements</b><br/>Development of plans, creation forms, production of elements and bags, installation. The preparation of the carbon, titanium and aluminum elements is expensive in the prototype version.<br/>50,000.--<br/><b>Mechanics</b><br/>As we develop Concept Car into an extraordinary travel vehicle, the engine, transmission, suspension, brakes and electronics are adapted, optimized and replaced, partially or completely. After that, the vehicle will be equipped as it may be necessary for the road and the field.<br/>25,000.--<br/><b>Adventures and 4-Wheel Entertainment</b><br/>Exhibition, preparation, materials, lodging and food. <br/>3,000.--<br/><b>Advertising</b><br/>Graphics, advertising, internet, inscription, print and work. These are smaller positions but of great importance for the success of good public relations.<br/>4,000.--<br/><b>Buffer</b><br/>In case of contingencies and possible repairs, reserves and rewards, it is nice to have a good cushion ;-)<br/>18,000.--<br/><b>Tax and Fees</b><br/>We have to calculate with 10% Tax and Fees, the coming of Indiegogo, Banks and Taxes. <br/>10`000.-<br/>If we do not collect the 120`000.- Doller within 40 days, we will have to proceed step by step. Completion would be lengthy and we would be exposed tot the risk of competition. The provided funds will be directed to the project and we will remain on course. There is no question about that.<br/> <h3>Media relations</h3>

<h3><b>Die Idee</b></h3>


Ein leichter
Off-Roader bringt dich weiter. Rally Fahrzeuge beweisen es:<b> Gewicht ist matchentscheidend.</b> Es macht ein
Fahrzeug geländetauglicher und ressourcenschonender. Dieses Prinzip übertragen
wir auf Reisefahrzeuge und wir gehen sogar noch einen Schritt weiter: <b>Wo immer möglich soll ein Bauteil mehrere
Funktionen haben.</b><br/>Damit
erreichen wir:<ul>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Eine Ersparnis an Gewicht, Material und Geld</li>
<li>Ein umwelt- und gesundheitsschonendes Vorankommen</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Multifunktionalität</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Mehr Fahrspass und grössere Geländetauglichkeit</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Wir sind ökonomischer und ökologischer unterwegs</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<h3>
</h3>
<h3><b>Das Konzept</b></h3>
<p>Unser
innovatives Konzept erspart Off-Road Fahrzeugen 400kg an überflüssiger Last! Wir achten
beim Aufbau genau darauf, was, wie und wo wir Elemente verbauen. Daraus
entstehen Leichtbau-elemente, die funktionell mehrfach nutzbar sind. Durch
ausgewählte Reiserouten zeigen wir, dass dieses Konzept funktioniert. <b>LET`S DO
SOME EPIC SHIT…</b> denn die Lösung ist bereits da!<b><br/></b></p>
<h3>
<b>Die Ziele: </b>
</h3>
<span><span></span></span><b>1. To raise 120`000.- Doller,</b> um den Conceptcar
„Tough Bone Defender“ ausstellungstauglich zu machen,  Produktionsreife zu erlangen und für unsere
Expeditionen einsatzbereit zu machen.<span></span><br/><b>2. Ausstellen an der:</b> <br/><ul>

<h3><b>Die Herausforderung                </b></h3>
<h3></h3>
<p>Die Idee und
das Konzept liegen voll im Trend. Somit sollten wir im Stande sein, der
Nachfrage des gesünderen und leichteren Reisens entgegen zu kommen. Deswegen
arbeiten wir mit Partnern und Menschen, denen ein Umdenken gleichermassen am
Herzen liegt. Eine weitere
Herausforderung ist die Herstellung der Materialien, die nicht immer so
umweltfreundlich hergestellt werden können, wie wir das gerne hätten. Wir sind
bestrebt das Beste für unsere Umwelt zu geben und noch besser zu werden, da wir
uns auch mit anderen Projekten für den Umweltschutz und die Gesundheit
einsetzten.</p>

</h3>Sisley
Kaltenbach – Ein Mann voller Visionen und Tatendrang. Das Aussergewöhnliche,
die Abenteuerlust und der Drang nach Extremen sowie der Kampf um das Erreichen
körperlicher und sportlicher Ziele prägen seit jeher Sisleys Leben. Über 15
Jahre als Profisportler, in denen er im Snowboard, Mountain Bike, Strainflex,
Jiu Jiutsu und Karate mehrere Schweizermeister-, Europameister- und
Weltmeister-Titel errang, sowie 15 Jahre als Personenschützer im High Risk
Level, die durch das  Betreuen und
Schützen namhafter Grössen aus Show Business, Wirtschaft und Politik geprägt
waren, schliffen, stählten und formten seinen Körper, seinen Willen und seine
mentale Stärke. Während dieser Zeit trainierte Sisley mehrere Olympia-Sieger,
Worldcup-Teilnehmer und Profisportler. Seine Abenteuerlust brachte ihn
sportlich und beruflich an alle Ecken der Welt. Die gesammelten Erfahrungen
machen Sisley zu einem umfassenden, taktisch denkenden Survival Freak. Seine
Motivation besteht darin, das Abenteuer in noch so kleinen Dingen zu finden.
Seine Vision ist es, den Menschen seine Lebensart näher zu bringen und
weiterzugeben. Neben Tough Bone ist er ausserdem auch Inhaber der Firmen
FaceLine und Seal Tac Functional Coaching. Sisley`s ungewöhnlicher Alltag im
Winter besteht nebst dem Ski- und Snowboardunterricht auch mal darin sich auf
die Haute Route von Zermatt nach Chamonix zu begeben und dort auf Berge wie den
Mont Blanc zu Kraxeln. Im Sommer haben dann Surfen, Survival Trainings und
persönliche Betreuungen Priorität oder dazwischen ab und zu auch mal ein
Ironman. Weil ihm das Leben Spass macht und dabei die Umwelt und die Natur sein
stetiger Begleiter sind, hat er zusätzlich das super coole Sea2Mountain Label in
die Welt gerufen, das sich mit dem Thema Abfallberg und wie man diese
dezimieren kann, beschäftigt. Sein
Lebensmotto lautet:

<p>Der Defender
ist Kult! Ein Mythos, der von Freiheit träumen lässt. Unser Tough Bone Conceptcar
stellten wir schon 2014 und 2015 mit ersten innovativen Leichtbau-Elementen bei
der Abenteuer &amp; Allrad Messe in Bad Kissingen zur Schau. Der Defender
hinterliess einen monströsen Eindruck! Die Resonanz von Fachleuten, Besuchern
und Medien war riesig. Der Ausbau
des Defenders mit Carbon-Elementen, Lithium Batterien und Polycarbonat bietet
unvergleichliche Chancen, da eine „light-Version“ im Off-Road Breiten-Markt ein
absolutes Novum wäre. Mit dieser Idee können gleich drei Märkte bedient werden:
Das Luxus- das Expeditions- und Rally-Segment. Ein Off-Road Reisefahrzeug, das
seinesgleichen sucht.
</p>
<h3><b>Warum Leichtbau</b></h3>
<p>Das Gewicht
entscheidet über die Nutzung, die Leistungsfähigkeit, den Komfort, die
Autonomie und den Verschleiss eines Off-Roaders. Durch
funktionellen Leichtbau erzielen wir weniger Material-Mitführung und
Spritverbrauch, geringeren Materialverschleiss, erhöhte Geländetauglichkeit,
grössere Reichweite, mehr Zuladung, ökonomischere Kraftentfaltung und
Fahreigenschaften, gepaart mit perfektem Design. Davon träumt jeder Off-Roader.
</p>
<h3><b>Material</b></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434834609/aq4dbc3xgyq1wqtzfhtt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Bei der
Materialwahl bietet insbesondere Carbon hervorragende Eigenschaften. Carbon ist
ein kohlenstofffaser-verstärkter Kunststoff. Er vereint bei vielen unserer
Bauteile die Eigenschaften von Titan und Aluminium. Deshalb setzen wir auf
diesen leistungsfähigen und vielseitig einsetzbaren Rohstoff. Carbon, bietet
Möglichkeiten, die bis anhin verwendete Materialien nicht oder nur teilweise
erreichen konnten. Extrem leicht, strapazierfähig und gegen äussere Einflüsse
beständig und individuell gestaltbar. Das heisst, dass es je nach Wunsch als
formbar, rutschfest, stichfest, glatt oder extrem belastbar produziert werden
kann. Carbon ist bei technischen Höchstleistungen nicht mehr weg zu denken.
</p>
<h3><b>Beispiele</b></h3>
<p><b>Begeh- und beladbares Dach:</b> Normalerweise
wird das Dach mit einem Aluminium-Riffelblech oder mit einem Dachträger
versehen. Ein Carbon-Element verringert das Gesamtgewicht erheblich. Durch diese
Gewichtsreduktion in der Höhe kommt der Schwerpunkt tiefer zu liegen, was für
alle Arten von Fahrzeugen insbesondere aber für Offroad-Fahrzeuge von enormem
Vorteil ist. Die Aerodynamik verändert sich nicht, keinerlei
Geräuschentwicklung kommt auf und spart Unmengen an Sprit.

</p>
<p><b>Fenster und Türen: </b>Glasscheiben,
und Innenleben werden durch das leichte Carbon- und oder Polycarbonat ersetzt.
Die Platten sind enorm stich-, schlag- und abriebfest, können nicht eingedrückt
werden und bieten einen Sicht- sowie Sonnenschutz. Die Carbon Türverkleidungen
sparen Gewicht und generieren neuen Stauraum nach aussen.

</p>
<p><b>Karosserie Teile:</b> Motorhauben,
Türen, Dach und Seitenbleche haben meist grosse Flächen, sind schwer und korrodieren.
Durch den Einsatz von leichtem Carbon gehört die Korrosion der Vergangenheit
an. Ausserdem wird der Körperschwerpunkt des Fahrzeuges erheblich Richtung
Boden gesenkt, was die Geländetauglichkeit, das Wiegeverhalten und die Agilität
enorm verbessert.

</p>
<p><b>Unterbodenschutz und Bodenblech:</b> Die bisher
verbauten Metallplatten sind schwer und können korrodieren. Carbon hingegen ist
wesentlich leichter und korrodiert nicht, was auf Expeditionen nur von Vorteil
sein kann. Die Platten sind enorm stich-, schlag- und abriebfest. Bei Schlägen
verformt sich Metall. Das Carbon nimmt nach einer Belastung wieder seine
Ursprungsform an.

</p>
<p><b>Innenausbau:</b> Jeder
Innenausbau ist Geschmacksache und individuell gestaltbar. Mit Carbon kann das
eigene Auto luxuriös oder zweckmässig ausgebaut werden. Die schöne
Oberflächenoptik des Materials und die Gestaltungsmöglichkeiten machen eine
Verkleidung weitgehend unnötig.

</p>
<p><b>Technische Fahrwerks- und Motorenteile:</b> Insbesondere
bewegliche und rotierende Teile folgen dem Masse- und Trägheitsprinzip. Je
leichter diese sind desto schneller werden sie beschleunigt, bzw. abgebremst.
Schwere, bewegliche und rotierende Bauteile bewegen sich träge. Leichte
hingegen lassen das Fahrzeug in seiner Charakteristik agiler, spritziger und
leistungsfähiger werden. Somit wird deren Verschleiss sowie jener weiterer
Fahrzeugteile erheblich gesenkt.
</p>

<h3>Funding</h3>

Der Mensch
wird immer reisen. Wie er das tut, hängt von seinen individuellen Ansichten und
Vorlieben ab. Mit diesem Konzept des funktionellen Leichtbaus, gepaart mit
ökologischer Energiegewinnung, unterstützen wir nicht nur die Spassseite,
sondern auch unsere Gesundheit. Zudem entlasten wir unsere Natur und Umwelt. Es
liegt uns am Herzen, dass sich diese Idee wie ein Lauffeuer verbreitet und sich
die Industrie und Private auch zu nutzen machen. Stellt euch vor, alle Arten

<b>I count on you, make it happen… ;-)</b><br/><br/><h3><b>Zusammenstellung der Kosten:</b></h3>
<b>Tough Bone Elemente</b><br/>Pläne erarbeiten,
Formen erstellen, Elemente und Taschen produzieren und verbauen. Die
Herstellung der Carbon, Titan und Aluminium-Elemente sind in der
Prototypen-Version teuer. <br/>50`000.-<br/><b>Mechanik</b><br/>Da wir den
Conceptcar zu einem ausserordentlichen Reisefahrzeug ausbauen, werden Motor,
Antrieb, Fahrwerk, Bremsen und Elektronik angepasst, optimiert und teilweise
oder ganz ersetzt. Dazu kommt die Ausstattung, die ein solches Fahrzeug auf
Reisen und im Gelände benötigt. <br/>25`000.-<br/><b>Abenteuer und Allrad</b><br/>Ausstellung,
Vorbereitung, Material, Übernachtung und Essen. <br/>3000.-

<br/><b>Werbung</b><br/>Grafik,
Werbung, Internet, Beschriftung, Druck, Arbeit und coole Gadgets. Das sind
kleinere Positionen, die jedoch von grosser Bedeutung für das Gelingen einer
guten PR sind. <br/>4000.-<br/><b>Puffer</b><br/>Für
Unvorhergesehenes und mögliche Reparaturen, Reserve und Löhne - Es ist
angenehm, über ein gutes Polster zu verfügen ;-) <br/>18`000.-

<br/><b>Tax and Fees</b><br/>Wir müssen
mit etwa 10% Tax und Fees rechnen, die von Indiegogo, Banken und Steuern
weggehen. <br/>10`000.-<br/>Wenn wir die
120`000.- Doller nicht innert 40 Tagen raisen, müssen wir Step by Step gehen.
Die Fertigstellung würde sich langwieriger gestalten und durch die Konkurrenz
gefährdet werden. Die erbrachten Finanzmittel werden weiterhin in das Projekt
fliessen und wir bleiben trotzdem dran - keine Frage.<br/><h3>

Für unsere Deutschsprachigen Freunde... ganz unten... ;-)
2400km further would u come... U would save 240l of Diesel... And save 384.- on a trip of 8000km!!! With 420kg. functionel and aerodynamics lighter the driving pleasure and the Off-Road capability is mind blowing... Is this benefit enough 4 u? Than have a look... Team Tough Bone
The Idea
Lightweight off-road vehicles take you further. Rally vehicles prove it: Weight is crucial. That makes the vehicle suitable for all kinds of terrain and resource-saving. We have applied that principle to travel vehicles and we have even gone one step further: Wherever it is possible, one component should have several functions. 
In that way, we provide:
Savings in weight, material and money

Healthy and environment-friendly progress
Multifunctionality
More pleasant driving and greater off-road capability
An economic and ecological path

The ConceptOur innovative approach saves 400kg of unnecessary load in off-road vehicles! We pay special attention to the construction, i.e. to what is installed, who installs it and in what way. This results in lightweight construction-elements, which are usable and functional several times. Through the selected route, we will show that this concept works. LET`S DO SOME EPIC SHIT... because the solution is already there!The Goals: 
1.   To raise 120,000.-- Doller and make the Concept Car ""Tough Bone Defender"" suitable for exhibition, in order to attain the production stage and prepare the vehicle for our expeditions. 2.   It shall be exhibited at:
Adventure Overland Show Stratford-upon-Avon, Race Course, England, September 2015
Adventure Northside, Travel and Survive World Wide, Walsrode, Germany, October 2015
Adventures and 4-Wheel Entertainment, Bad Kissingen, Germany, June 2016

                 The Challenge
The idea and the concept are trendy. For that reason, we should be able to meet the demands for healthier and easier traveling. We work with partners and people, who equally have rethinking in their heart. Another challenge is the production of materials that cannot be always made as environmentally friendly as we would like. We are striving to give our best for the environment and to become even better, because we are involved in other projects related to health and environmental issues.

Sisley Kaltenbach - A man full of vision and thirst for action. The life of Sisley has always been characterized by the spirit of adventure, the desire for extreme situations and the struggle for the achievement of physical and sport goals. His body, will and mental forced have been sharpened, steeled and formed by more than 15 years of experience as a professional athlete, during which he won several Swiss, European and World titles of snowboard, mountain bike, strainflex, Ju Jitsu and Karate, as well as by 15 years as High-Risk level bodyguard, in the service of renamed people from show business, economics and politics. During this time, Sisley coached several Olympic champions, World Cup participants and professional athletes. His adventurous spirit led him to all corners of the world as an athlete and a professional. The accumulated experience made Sisley a Survival Freak with comprehensive and tactic vision. His motivation is to find adventure even in the smallest things. His vision is to bring his way of life closer to people and to pass it on. Besides Tough Bone, he also owns the companies Face Line and Seal Tac Functional Coaching. Sisley`s unusual everyday winter activities consist not only in skiing, but also in teaching snowboard lessons, traveling through the Haute Route from Zermatt to Chamonix and climbing high mountains, such as Mont Blanc. In summer, surfing, survival training and personal care have priority. From time to time, he may also participate in an Ironman. Given that he enjoys life with nature and the environment as his permanent companions, he created the super cool Sea2Mountain Label, by which he deals with the issue of waste mountains and the way to decimate them. His life motto is:BE THAT KIND OF PERSON WHEN YOUR FEET HIT THE FLOOR EACH MORNING THE DEVIL SAYS „OH CRAP…“Sisley KaltenbachThe DudeLand Rover Defender 110 TD5

The Defender is cult! A myth that makes you dream of freedom. We introduced our Tough Bone Concept Car in 2014 and 2015, together with the first innovative lightweight elements, at the exposition ""Adventures and 4-Wheel Entertainment"" in Bad Kissingen. The Defender made a monstrous impression! The reaction of professionals, visitors and the media was huge. The enhancement of the Defenders with carbon elements lithium batteries and polycarbonate offers unparalleled opportunities as a ""light-version"", which represents an absolute novelty in the Off-Road general market. With this idea, it is possible to serve three markets, the luxury, expedition and rally segments. It is an off-road travel vehicle that has no equal.
Why do we need a lightweight construction? 
Weight is decisive for the use, performance, comfort, autonomy and wear of Off-Roaders. By using a functional lightweight structure, we achieve less material-entrainment and fuel consumption, lower material wear, increased off-road capability, greater range, higher load capacity, a more economical power delivery and better driving characteristics, combined with perfect design. That is the dream of every Off-Roader.
Material


When choosing materials, Carbon presents outstanding properties. By ""carbon"" we mean a carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic. It combines the properties of titanium and aluminum in many of our components. Therefore, we rely on this powerful and versatile raw material. Carbon, offers opportunities that could not be reached totally or partially with the materials used until now. It is extremely light, durable, resistant to external influences and individually adjustable. That means that it can be produced at will as malleable, slip-resistant, puncture-resistant, smooth or extremely resilient. It is no longer possible to imagine technical excellence without carbon.
Examples
A walkable and loadable roof: Normally, the roof is equipped with an aluminum checker plate or with a roof rack. A carbon element reduces greatly the overall weight. Due to this weight decrease, the center of gravity is set lower, which is a huge advantage for all types of vehicles, especially for off-road vehicles. Aerodynamics do not change; there is no noise and huge quantities of fuel are saved. Windows and doors: Glass panels and inner parts are replaced with carbon or other polycarbonate. The plates are enormously resistant to puncture, impact and abrasion. They cannot be dented and offer visual and sun protection. The Carbon door panels save weight and generate new storage space outside.Chassis parts: Hoods, doors, roof and side panels usually have large areas, which are heavy and corrode. Thanks to the use of lightweight carbon fiber, corrosion is something that belongs to the past. In addition to that, the center of gravity of the vehicle is greatly lowered towards the floor what the off-road capability, which hugely improves off-road capability and agility.Underbody protection and bottom plate: The metal plates used until now are heavy and may corrode. Carbon, however, is much lighter and does not corrode, which is a great advantage during expeditions. The panels are largely resistant to puncture, impact and abrasion. Metal is formed by beating. After exposure to a load, carbon resumes its original shape.Interior: Every interior is a matter of taste and it is individually adjusted. With the help of carbon, a car can be made luxurious or practical. The nice surface appearance of the material and its design possibilities make any coating unnecessary. Technical parts of the chassis and engine: In particular, moving and rotating parts follow the principle of mass and inertia. The lighter they are, the faster they accelerate or decelerate. When moving and rotating, heavy components are sluggishly. Light parts make the vehicle agile, lively and powerful. In that way, the wear of parts is significantly reduced.Requirements

The expectations of a customer from his vehicle are as individual as the owner himself, no matter that it is a luxury, expedition, travel, fun or rally vehicle. We offer the chance to try different approaches and alternatives, as well as to successfully implement wishes and ideas for every kind of off-road vehicle: Land Rover, Jeep, Mercedes, Toyota, Nissan, Unimog, Ford, MAN, Iveco, VW etc. The modifications are exclusive and customer-oriented designs.Products
We guarantee the excellent quality of any product that has been developed, built and converted by Tough Bone Tuning Solution. We work closely with specialists, drive testers and craftsmen. All elements have been developed by Tough Bone and tested under extreme conditions. Made in Switzerland.

People will always travel, but the way they do it depends on their individual views and preferences. Functional lightweight construction and ecological energy production are the principles that enable us to support not only entertainment, but also our health. In addition to that, we contribute to relieving our natural environment. It is important to us that this idea might spread like wildfire and be used in both, everyday life and private activities. Imagine what it would be like, if all types of vehicles were built with this approach!That is why we need your support, so that we might achieve these goals: 1.   To raise 120,000.-- Doller and make the Concept Car ""Tough Bone Defender"" suitable for exhibition and attain the production stage.2.   Exhibitions at:

Summary of costs:
Tough Bone elementsDevelopment of plans, creation forms, production of elements and bags, installation. The preparation of the carbon, titanium and aluminum elements is expensive in the prototype version.50,000.--MechanicsAs we develop Concept Car into an extraordinary travel vehicle, the engine, transmission, suspension, brakes and electronics are adapted, optimized and replaced, partially or completely. After that, the vehicle will be equipped as it may be necessary for the road and the field.25,000.--Adventures and 4-Wheel EntertainmentExhibition, preparation, materials, lodging and food. 3,000.--AdvertisingGraphics, advertising, internet, inscription, print and work. These are smaller positions but of great importance for the success of good public relations.4,000.--BufferIn case of contingencies and possible repairs, reserves and rewards, it is nice to have a good cushion ;-)18,000.--Tax and FeesWe have to calculate with 10% Tax and Fees, the coming of Indiegogo, Banks and Taxes. 10`000.-If we do not collect the 120`000.- Doller within 40 days, we will have to proceed step by step. Completion would be lengthy and we would be exposed tot the risk of competition. The provided funds will be directed to the project and we will remain on course.

Die Idee


Ein leichter
Off-Roader bringt dich weiter. Rally Fahrzeuge beweisen es: Gewicht ist matchentscheidend. Es macht ein
Fahrzeug geländetauglicher und ressourcenschonender. Dieses Prinzip übertragen
wir auf Reisefahrzeuge und wir gehen sogar noch einen Schritt weiter: Wo immer möglich soll ein Bauteil mehrere
Funktionen haben.Damit
erreichen wir:

Eine Ersparnis an Gewicht, Material und Geld
Ein umwelt- und gesundheitsschonendes Vorankommen

Multifunktionalität

Mehr Fahrspass und grössere Geländetauglichkeit

Wir sind ökonomischer und ökologischer unterwegs





Das Konzept
Unser
innovatives Konzept erspart Off-Road Fahrzeugen 400kg an überflüssiger Last! Wir achten
beim Aufbau genau darauf, was, wie und wo wir Elemente verbauen. Daraus
entstehen Leichtbau-elemente, die funktionell mehrfach nutzbar sind. Durch
ausgewählte Reiserouten zeigen wir, dass dieses Konzept funktioniert. LET`S DO
SOME EPIC SHIT… denn die Lösung ist bereits da!

Die Ziele: 

1. To raise 120`000.- Doller, um den Conceptcar
„Tough Bone Defender“ ausstellungstauglich zu machen,  Produktionsreife zu erlangen und für unsere
Expeditionen einsatzbereit zu machen.2. Ausstellen an der: 
Adventure Overland Show Stratford-upon-Avon,

Die Herausforderung                

Die Idee und
das Konzept liegen voll im Trend. Somit sollten wir im Stande sein, der
Nachfrage des gesünderen und leichteren Reisens entgegen zu kommen. Deswegen
arbeiten wir mit Partnern und Menschen, denen ein Umdenken gleichermassen am
Herzen liegt. Eine weitere
Herausforderung ist die Herstellung der Materialien, die nicht immer so
umweltfreundlich hergestellt werden können, wie wir das gerne hätten. Wir sind
bestrebt das Beste für unsere Umwelt zu geben und noch besser zu werden, da wir
uns auch mit anderen Projekten für den Umweltschutz und die Gesundheit
einsetzten.

Der Mann dahinter              



Sisley
Kaltenbach – Ein Mann voller Visionen und Tatendrang. Das Aussergewöhnliche,
die Abenteuerlust und der Drang nach Extremen sowie der Kampf um das Erreichen
körperlicher und sportlicher Ziele prägen seit jeher Sisleys Leben. Über 15
Jahre als Profisportler, in denen er im Snowboard, Mountain Bike, Strainflex,
Jiu Jiutsu und Karate mehrere Schweizermeister-, Europameister- und
Weltmeister-Titel errang, sowie 15 Jahre als Personenschützer im High Risk
Level, die durch das  Betreuen und
Schützen namhafter Grössen aus Show Business, Wirtschaft und Politik geprägt
waren, schliffen, stählten und formten seinen Körper, seinen Willen und seine
mentale Stärke. Während dieser Zeit trainierte Sisley mehrere Olympia-Sieger,
Worldcup-Teilnehmer und Profisportler. Seine Abenteuerlust brachte ihn
sportlich und beruflich an alle Ecken der Welt. Die gesammelten Erfahrungen
machen Sisley zu einem umfassenden, taktisch denkenden Survival Freak. Seine
Motivation besteht darin, das Abenteuer in noch so kleinen Dingen zu finden.
Seine Vision ist es, den Menschen seine Lebensart näher zu bringen und
weiterzugeben. Neben Tough Bone ist er ausserdem auch Inhaber der Firmen
FaceLine und Seal Tac Functional Coaching. Sisley`s ungewöhnlicher Alltag im
Winter besteht nebst dem Ski- und Snowboardunterricht auch mal darin sich auf
die Haute Route von Zermatt nach Chamonix zu begeben und dort auf Berge wie den
Mont Blanc zu Kraxeln. Im Sommer haben dann Surfen, Survival Trainings und
persönliche Betreuungen Priorität oder dazwischen ab und zu auch mal ein
Ironman. Weil ihm das Leben Spass macht und dabei die Umwelt und die Natur sein
stetiger Begleiter sind, hat er zusätzlich das super coole Sea2Mountain Label in
die Welt gerufen, das sich mit dem Thema Abfallberg und wie man diese
dezimieren kann, beschäftigt. Sein
Lebensmotto lautet:

Land Rover Defender 110 TD5




Der Defender
ist Kult! Ein Mythos, der von Freiheit träumen lässt. Unser Tough Bone Conceptcar
stellten wir schon 2014 und 2015 mit ersten innovativen Leichtbau-Elementen bei
der Abenteuer & Allrad Messe in Bad Kissingen zur Schau. Der Defender
hinterliess einen monströsen Eindruck! Die Resonanz von Fachleuten, Besuchern
und Medien war riesig. Der Ausbau
des Defenders mit Carbon-Elementen, Lithium Batterien und Polycarbonat bietet
unvergleichliche Chancen, da eine „light-Version“ im Off-Road Breiten-Markt ein
absolutes Novum wäre. Mit dieser Idee können gleich drei Märkte bedient werden:
Das Luxus- das Expeditions- und Rally-Segment. Ein Off-Road Reisefahrzeug, das
seinesgleichen sucht.

Warum Leichtbau
Das Gewicht
entscheidet über die Nutzung, die Leistungsfähigkeit, den Komfort, die
Autonomie und den Verschleiss eines Off-Roaders. Durch
funktionellen Leichtbau erzielen wir weniger Material-Mitführung und
Spritverbrauch, geringeren Materialverschleiss, erhöhte Geländetauglichkeit,
grössere Reichweite, mehr Zuladung, ökonomischere Kraftentfaltung und
Fahreigenschaften, gepaart mit perfektem Design. Davon träumt jeder Off-Roader.

Material


Bei der
Materialwahl bietet insbesondere Carbon hervorragende Eigenschaften. Carbon ist
ein kohlenstofffaser-verstärkter Kunststoff. Er vereint bei vielen unserer
Bauteile die Eigenschaften von Titan und Aluminium. Deshalb setzen wir auf
diesen leistungsfähigen und vielseitig einsetzbaren Rohstoff. Carbon, bietet
Möglichkeiten, die bis anhin verwendete Materialien nicht oder nur teilweise
erreichen konnten. Extrem leicht, strapazierfähig und gegen äussere Einflüsse
beständig und individuell gestaltbar. Das heisst, dass es je nach Wunsch als
formbar, rutschfest, stichfest, glatt oder extrem belastbar produziert werden
kann. Carbon ist bei technischen Höchstleistungen nicht mehr weg zu denken.

Beispiele
Begeh- und beladbares Dach: Normalerweise
wird das Dach mit einem Aluminium-Riffelblech oder mit einem Dachträger
versehen. Ein Carbon-Element verringert das Gesamtgewicht erheblich. Durch diese
Gewichtsreduktion in der Höhe kommt der Schwerpunkt tiefer zu liegen, was für
alle Arten von Fahrzeugen insbesondere aber für Offroad-Fahrzeuge von enormem
Vorteil ist. Die Aerodynamik verändert sich nicht, keinerlei
Geräuschentwicklung kommt auf und spart Unmengen an Sprit.


Fenster und Türen: Glasscheiben,
und Innenleben werden durch das leichte Carbon- und oder Polycarbonat ersetzt.
Die Platten sind enorm stich-, schlag- und abriebfest, können nicht eingedrückt
werden und bieten einen Sicht- sowie Sonnenschutz. Die Carbon Türverkleidungen
sparen Gewicht und generieren neuen Stauraum nach aussen.


Karosserie Teile: Motorhauben,
Türen, Dach und Seitenbleche haben meist grosse Flächen, sind schwer und korrodieren.
Durch den Einsatz von leichtem Carbon gehört die Korrosion der Vergangenheit
an. Ausserdem wird der Körperschwerpunkt des Fahrzeuges erheblich Richtung
Boden gesenkt, was die Geländetauglichkeit, das Wiegeverhalten und die Agilität
enorm verbessert.


Unterbodenschutz und Bodenblech: Die bisher
verbauten Metallplatten sind schwer und können korrodieren. Carbon hingegen ist
wesentlich leichter und korrodiert nicht, was auf Expeditionen nur von Vorteil
sein kann. Die Platten sind enorm stich-, schlag- und abriebfest. Bei Schlägen
verformt sich Metall. Das Carbon nimmt nach einer Belastung wieder seine
Ursprungsform an.


Innenausbau: Jeder
Innenausbau ist Geschmacksache und individuell gestaltbar. Mit Carbon kann das
eigene Auto luxuriös oder zweckmässig ausgebaut werden. Die schöne
Oberflächenoptik des Materials und die Gestaltungsmöglichkeiten machen eine
Verkleidung weitgehend unnötig.


Technische Fahrwerks- und Motorenteile: Insbesondere
bewegliche und rotierende Teile folgen dem Masse- und Trägheitsprinzip. Je
leichter diese sind desto schneller werden sie beschleunigt, bzw. abgebremst.
Schwere, bewegliche und rotierende Bauteile bewegen sich träge. Leichte
hingegen lassen das Fahrzeug in seiner Charakteristik agiler, spritziger und
leistungsfähiger werden. Somit wird deren Verschleiss sowie jener weiterer
Fahrzeugteile erheblich gesenkt.

Ansprüche



Die
Ansprüche eines Kunden an sein Fahrzeug sind so individuell wie die Besitzer
selbst. Egal ob es ein Luxus-, Expeditions-, Reise-, Fun- oder Rallyfahrzeug
wird. Wir bieten die Möglichkeit verschiedene Konzepte und Alternativen,
Wünsche und Ideen erfolgreich umzusetzen. Für jedes Off-Road-Fahrzeug: Land
Rover, Jeep, Mercedes, Toyota, Nissan, Unimog, Ford, MAN, Iveco, VW usw. Die
Umbauten sind exklusive, kundenorientierte Sonderanfertigungen.Produkte
Auf jedes
Produkt, das von Tough Bone Tuning Solution entwickelt, verbaut und umgerüstet
wurde, garantieren wir eine hervorragende Qualität. Wir arbeiten eng mit
Spezialisten, Reiseerprobten und Handwerkern zusammen. Alle Elemente wurden von
Tough Bone entwickelt und unter extremen Bedienungen getestet. Made in
Switzerland.

Der Mensch
wird immer reisen. Wie er das tut, hängt von seinen individuellen Ansichten und
Vorlieben ab. Mit diesem Konzept des funktionellen Leichtbaus, gepaart mit
ökologischer Energiegewinnung, unterstützen wir nicht nur die Spassseite,
sondern auch unsere Gesundheit. Zudem entlasten wir unsere Natur und Umwelt. Es
liegt uns am Herzen, dass sich diese Idee wie ein Lauffeuer verbreitet und sich
die Industrie und Private auch zu nutzen machen. Stellt euch vor, alle Arten
von Fahrzeugen würden mit dieser Einstellung gebaut werden! Deshalb brauchen
wir deine Unterstützung, damit diese Ziele erreicht werden können:1.  To raise 120`000.- Dollar, um den Conceptcar „Tough Bone Defender“ ausstellungstauglich zu machen und Produktionsreife zu erlangen.2.  Ausstellen an der:

Reisen und im Gelände benötigt. 25`000.-Abenteuer und AllradAusstellung,
Vorbereitung, Material, Übernachtung und Essen. 3000.-

WerbungGrafik,
Werbung, Internet, Beschriftung, Druck, Arbeit und coole Gadgets. Das sind
kleinere Positionen, die jedoch von grosser Bedeutung für das Gelingen einer
guten PR sind. 4000.-PufferFür
Unvorhergesehenes und mögliche Reparaturen, Reserve und Löhne - Es ist
angenehm, über ein gutes Polster zu verfügen ;-) 18`000.-

Tax and FeesWir müssen
mit etwa 10% Tax und Fees rechnen, die von Indiegogo, Banken und Steuern
weggehen. 10`000.-Wenn wir die
120`000.- Doller nicht innert 40 Tagen raisen, müssen wir Step by Step gehen.
Die Fertigstellung würde sich langwieriger gestalten und durch die Konkurrenz
gefährdet werden. Die erbrachten Finanzmittel werden weiterhin in das Projekt
fliessen und wir bleiben trotzdem dran - keine Frage.

In today's food market, the products we buy have very little information about their origins, what they really contain, and how they were made or who harvested them...


Wouldn't it be great to buy products without that nagging feeling that some unethical practices have been involved in the making of it?
WHY?
We believe greater access to natural and organic supplements starts with a clean, sustainable and transparent product supply chain.

NatureSynergy is part of a new kind of industry: ecological, transparent, kind and focused on a better future. It is an opportunity to support the shift taking place globally: as the food and nutraceutical industries need to change, we want to help create that change! By conducting a business with such strong ethics and transparency, we know it will motivate others to do the same and send a message to the industry. 
VISION AND GOALS



A new product line for animals and people composed of pure plant and mineral based ingredients. Vegetarian, vegan, dairy free, organic, natural and nonGMO supplements targeting specific needs. Products are Fair Trade, sustainable, cruelty free and traceable. This business begins by having an online store with animal products and will expand to human products by next year.




HELPING OTHERS AND CARING
Once the online store is created, we will have a list of carefully selected charities and organizations who will receive a percentage of sales. The difference about how we are going to do this is that the buyer will get to choose which charity he/she wants to donate to when buying one of our product.  We have all ready started contacting organizations like Greenpeace and Amnesty International, as well as local and  International Animal Rescues


HOW:
With an enormous amount of investigative work, challenging each potential supplier with what can be regarded as crazy activist questions! We demand proof and figure out who has the most ethical transparent base plant extracts and minerals. Then we go to work and create our own blends. 



THINGS WE KNOW...


Our professional backgrounds are in Animal Science, Veterinary Medicine, Business management and Marketing, Horse Training, Human relations and Education. With over 25 years of experience in those fields, we have decided to use our knowledge to do something meaningful and create a positive impact for all and for the planet. 


The first ten blends or pure supplements we will be launching will be:

Digestive support, Calming formula, Anti inflammatory, Anti cramping, Joint support, Liver cleanse, Immune system booster and a wide range of flower frequencies essences. 















The contributors to this project will be our jump starters; sending the company into a vibrant energy. We want to use the need for natural supplements and raise awareness about child labour, modern slavery, animal rights and ecology.

So for those of you I haven't had the pleasure of getting to know well yet, here's some basics about me: I have multiple sclerosis, among other chronic, noncurable diseases (alpha 1 antytripsin deficiency, degenerative disc disease, etc.). I've had it for almost 14 years now, and it's gotten much worse over the past 4-5 years. I had been working full time as a medical transcriptionist from home, for one of the hospitals in town, all while trying to be a wife and a mom to my 3 children: a 20 year old son in college, a 15 year old son in high school, and a 7 year old daughter, now in 2nd grade. In July of 2014, I filed for short term disability with my employer. This allowed me to keep at least a partial paycheck coming in for a while and keep my benefits (or so I thought). It has been a roller coaster with the disability insurance.  I am now on long term disability with them...but am only officially approved through next month.  Who knows what will happen at that point.  Meanwhile, that company has employed the assistance of Allsup, a company that assists people with the process of applying for Social Security disability.  I got an official denial from Social Security last month after filing an application in late summer.  We are appealing.  Unfortunately though, possibly the *worst* part of my situation right now with my disability is that we no longer have health or dental insurance as of January 1st.  The hospital would only allow me to keep it for one year from the date I began long term disability, leaving us in a very precarious situation right now.  </p><p></p><p>Through all of this, my husband still hasn't found a job. He's been out of work for some time, due to various reasons, which has made it very hard to find work. He has a B.S. in Accounting from Univ. of South Alabama, plus training in medical billing and coding, but the work is either just not there, or he can't seem to get any call backs. We had been working incredibly hard on our little jewelry business that many of you have gotten pieces from (Night Walker Designs).  He is the genius artist, so most of it has been left to him.  My role has been increasingly limited helping out with it due to my physical situation, making it nearly impossible to keep our feet on the ledge and BEGIN what could potentially be a decent income for our family.  Between the two of us- with my MS, his diabetes, BOTH of our severe depression- there just aren't hours in the day to get these things done for the business that on paper really shouldn't have taken any time at all.  </p><p></p><p>Meanwhile....we're getting further behind on our bills.  We've had at least two VERY close calls where we almost lost our house.  We limped through Christmas and barely managed to provide a very few gifts for my youngest two children, due only to the generosity of a few angels that were sent to me.  All through Christmas season, I debated whether or not to do another crowd funding campaign.  I had done one a year previously, but didn't want to put anyone out, or have anyone think less of me.  It was incredibly hard to do it the last time, as it is a profoundly humiliating experience.  I was raised to be self-sufficient and not ask for things from people, which made it that much worse.  Through many different tactics, we made it through Christmas and I had every intention of trying my hardest in the new year to figure out just what exactly we could do to keep our house.</p><p></p><p>I should mention here why it is such a big deal to me to keep this house.  It's not just ANY house.  This house was built in 1955, not making it officially recognizable as a ""historic home"", but close.  My husband's parents bought the house shortly after it was built, and both he and his older brother were born and raised here.  In 1999, after my husband had moved out and started a career in accounting, he came to visit his mother during lunch one day.  His mother had severe COPD after years of smoking.  His father was outside cutting the grass during their visit.  Next thing he knew, his father had collapsed in the driveway, with the mower still running.  He had suffered a major heart attack, and just like that, he was gone.  Buddy Walker had been a very hard worker, and had built a career that required him to spend many days each month on the road.  He had recently retired and had begun to finally enjoy some time at home, caring for his wife, who had been the love of his life since she married him in July of 1955.   By this time, my husband's older brother had already married and started a family (there being a ten year gap between them), so it fell to my husband to quit his job, move back home, and care for his very elderly, ill mother.  This went on for more than five years, until I came into the picture with my own brood.  We dated for two years before I moved in, with the intention of marrying that year (2004).  Within two months of my moving in, his mother passed away in her sleep in what is now my bedroom.  It took two years for my husband to feel comfortable enough for us to move into that room (the master bed/bath).  But family history, births, deaths and marriages in this old home aren't the only reasons, for me, that this house is so special.  *Some* of my more intuitive friends out there may understand this better than others.  The very first time I came to this house was with my now-ex-husband, who was friends with my now-husband at that time.  We came over for dinner, and I IMMEDIATELY clicked with this place.  I told him then how much it felt like my home....how much it reminded me of my parent's home that I was raised in.  True, it does have several features that are similar to my old house.  Not similar enough to explain this feeling though.  I have honestly felt like this place was home, the home I had been searching for, in all my eight moves in just nine years.  I told my husband when I decided to move in here with him, just before we got engaged, that he needed to be REALLY SURE about us before bringing me here, because once I moved in, he would have to ""drag my cold, dead body"" back out of it.  This I said to a man who had never married and was himself 34 years old, coming from a 29 year old woman, mother of two, with TWO ex-husbands that I had stayed married to for only four years each!  That was more than 10 years ago, and I still feel exactly the same way as I did then, never wavering even a bit, even with the ups and downs and hardships we've faced in our marriage.  Don't get me wrong, I have every intention of staying married to my husband until one of us dies.  But I absolutely intend for that time to be served in THIS house.  </p><p></p><p>Now that you know how I feel about this house, it will not surprise you to know that I am desperate to KEEP it, and very afraid that our financial picture will make that difficult if not impossible.  This poor old place is sorely in need of a LOT of repairs.  As it is an older home, it seems like everything is deciding that this is a good time to start to break/chip/wear/sink/leak/etc.!  But again, I stress to you that I was *not* intending on asking for help...not with the mortgage...not with any repairs. </p><p></p><p>That is until the bottom dropped out.  Literally...of our bedroom ceiling.  We've been dealing with leaks in the roof for approximately ten years.  This house is kind of a patchwork house, which has made the roof system kind of complex.  It originally started as a small ranch-style.  Then there was the addition of the den and kitchen, plus patio.  Then the master bedroom and bath were added.  Then ""the cave"" was added which used to be a carport.  So there are multiple roofs in certain locations, which were built one right over the other.  Our hallway is the safest place in the house, having three roofs over it where several additions intersect.  Unfortunately, this has left several places where there have been dips where drainage has been a challenge.  My husband has to remember to get up onto the roof several times a year (which terrifies him as he is afraid of heights!) and use the leaf blower to blow all the leaves off the house.  This is a huge chore, as there are multiple large oak trees on all sides of the house.  Even with this, there have still been leaks in various places though.  So he has gone back up over the years and done his best to patch weak spots with tar, with limited success.  What truly needs to be done is for a new, whole roof to be put on, and for any problem areas to have the pitch in the rooftop raised to allow for adequate drainage of water and less buildup of fallen leaves.  Ideally, some of the oak trees and/or branches would be cut as well.  </p><p></p><p>So it is with great humility and desperation that I ask you all for your help.  I am not expecting something for nothing however.  The IndieGoGo platform offers a wonderful way for me to set up ""perks"" for contributions of varying sizes.  For each of the perks, I have tried to set it up so that their value is worth more than the contribution amount.  For example: if you donate $50, I will offer you $60 worth of merchandise from either our online Etsy store or our new website, <a href=""http://www.nightwalkerdesigns.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.nightwalkerdesigns.com</a>.  </p><p></p><p>So please, I ask you to help me save this wonderful old family home and give her a new roof that will keep us dry hopefully for many decades to come.  Your generosity will be treasured by me and my family.  Thank you for taking the time to read all of this!</p></div>","I know that it's often hard to get to know people on social media.

I told him then how much it felt like my home....how much it reminded me of my parent's home that I was raised in.  True, it does have several features that are similar to my old house.  Not similar enough to explain this feeling though.  I have honestly felt like this place was home, the home I had been searching for, in all my eight moves in just nine years.  I told my husband when I decided to move in here with him, just before we got engaged, that he needed to be REALLY SURE about us before bringing me here, because once I moved in, he would have to ""drag my cold, dead body"" back out of it.  This I said to a man who had never married and was himself 34 years old, coming from a 29 year old woman, mother of two, with TWO ex-husbands that I had stayed married to for only four years each!  That was more than 10 years ago, and I still feel exactly the same way as I did then, never wavering even a bit, even with the ups and downs and hardships we've faced in our marriage.  Don't get me wrong, I have every intention of staying married to my husband until one of us dies.  But I absolutely intend for that time to be served in THIS house.  Now that you know how I feel about this house, it will not surprise you to know that I am desperate to KEEP it, and very afraid that our financial picture will make that difficult if not impossible.  This poor old place is sorely in need of a LOT of repairs.  As it is an older home, it seems like everything is deciding that this is a good time to start to break/chip/wear/sink/leak/etc.!  But again, I stress to you that I was *not* intending on asking for help...not with the mortgage...not with any repairs. That is until the bottom dropped out.  Literally...of our bedroom ceiling.  We've been dealing with leaks in the roof for approximately ten years.  This house is kind of a patchwork house, which has made the roof system kind of complex.  It originally started as a small ranch-style.  Then there was the addition of the den and kitchen, plus patio.  Then the master bedroom and bath were added.  Then ""the cave"" was added which used to be a carport.  So there are multiple roofs in certain locations, which were built one right over the other.  Our hallway is the safest place in the house, having three roofs over it where several additions intersect.  Unfortunately, this has left several places where there have been dips where drainage has been a challenge.  My husband has to remember to get up onto the roof several times a year (which terrifies him as he is afraid of heights!) and use the leaf blower to blow all the leaves off the house.  This is a huge chore, as there are multiple large oak trees on all sides of the house.  Even with this, there have still been leaks in various places though.  So he has gone back up over the years and done his best to patch weak spots with tar, with limited success.  What truly needs to be done is for a new, whole roof to be put on, and for any problem areas to have the pitch in the rooftop raised to allow for adequate drainage of water and less buildup of fallen leaves.  Ideally, some of the oak trees and/or branches would be cut as well.  So it is with great humility and desperation that I ask you all for your help.  I am not expecting something for nothing however.  The IndieGoGo platform offers a wonderful way for me to set up ""perks"" for contributions of varying sizes.  For each of the perks, I have tried to set it up so that their value is worth more than the contribution amount.  For example: if you donate $50, I will offer you $60 worth of merchandise from either our online Etsy store or our new website, www.nightwalkerdesigns.com.  So please, I ask you to help me save this wonderful old family home and give her a new roof that will keep us dry hopefully for many decades to come.  Your generosity will be treasured by me and my family.  Thank you for taking the time to read all of this!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>THE BIRTH OF THE HIP BAR!</p>
<p>My health went on a not so exhilarating
rollercoaster ride for many years. I dealt with tumors, cysts, adrenals
dysfunction, thyroid issues, and a very rare “supposedly” incurable and
disfiguring disease called Morphea. It took me almost losing all of my bodily/cognitive
functions to start taking care of my overall health and taking it seriously. A few years ago I quit my corporate job, delved into a healthier
lifestyle and began an intensive and full body cleanse that gradually cured me
of my aliments, including the “incurable” Morphea.</p>
<p>This experience compelled me to
help others with their health. I became a health coach and counseled people on
how to establish better eating habits amongst other things. In the process I
discovered that most people struggled with what I had struggled with when I
began my health journey, overcoming sugar cravings. This led me to develop my
own concoction of organic, sugar free, Dessert-Inspired smoothies. These
smoothies were such a hit with my clients that I started selling them at my
sister and her husband’s café, where they also sold successfully. With that the
idea to launch The HIP Bar was born, a fun loving place dedicated to showing
and educating everyone on how healthy living can be sustainable and delectable!</p>
<p>WHY HELP BRING THE HIP BAR TO INWOOD?</p>
<p>This smoothie/juice bar will be the first of its kind in the
neighborhood and we are confident that so many people will benefit from having
a new healthy alternative to eating and snacking in the neighborhood. Here’s
why we’re unique: </p>
<p>We’ll offer one of a kind Dessert-Inspired &amp; Specialty Smoothies
that are:</p>
<p>- Highly Nutritional</p>
<p>-Organic/ All natural/locally farmed &amp; sourced
ingredients</p>
<p>- Sugar Free</p>
<p>We’ll offer Cold Press Juices instead of Regular Fresh
Juices </p>
<p>- Retain more nutrients and for longer periods of time</p>
<p>We’ll be hosting Cultural Activities/Art Exhibits/Educational
&amp; Health Related Workshops</p>
<p>In addition we’ll offer a variety of vegan snacks and our
bar will have the sit-in café vibe offering free Wi-Fi to our customers.  </p>
<p>WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP!</p>
<p>Months ago we signed a lease for the space where we plan on
opening The HIP Bar, located in the very vibrant neighborhood of Inwood, NY, right in front of the Fort Tryon Park/The Cloisters. The space was a beauty salon
for 30 plus years and had never been renovated. As soon as we had the keys in hand we
began the work necessary to start the renovation project, which included fixing
floors, walls, ceiling, upgrading bathroom etc. To our disappointment, the
renovation plans came to a halt when the community organization backing our
project suddenly cut funding. This is where you come in; your contributions can help bring the renovation project back to life and get The HIP Bar up and
running. </p>
<p>Please donate and help us make this happen; and don’t’
forget to share our campaign with your friends, family, and networks. </p>
<p>Thank you for all of your support! We
would be delighted to have you as a part of the HIP family!  </p>

</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>We are Marco, Alessandro, Thomas and Giacomo and today we are shooting this video to present you a particular and very interesting project.</p>
<p>The project has started as a scholastic research to understand and analyze a growing phenomenon which lies at our heart : the crowdfunding.</p>
<p>This reality has allowed several tiny projects to take place.</p>
<p>Sure enough, there are some people like you who are willing to give even only one dollar to help someone.</p>
<p>So we have decided to add to our research this real project: and that’s why we are starting our crowdfunding campaign .</p>
<p>At this time here in Italy it’s winter  and the months between January and Mach are the coldest ones.</p>
<p>Since Milan is a big city, there is a strong homeless presence : lots of people fight against cold and hunger in order to survive day by day.</p>
<p>By looking around you, you can realize in few seconds the cruelty of this reality that most of the people ignore. An enormous amount of people live alone on the street and, in the hope to receive a coin, they have to spend their days sat on the sidewalk.</p>
<p>Moreover, these people are considered invisible from the rest of community because of the other citizens’ indifference.</p>
<p>In  Milan, as in most of the cities of the world, there are charity associations that have the willingness to help the homeless, but especially in this tough period they are not able to face this issue.</p>
<p>For these reasons, we have decided to be part of this situation, but in order to become more effective we need even your help, because only four people can’t bring any kind of help, but an entire community can change this situation.</p>
<p>Using the collected money, we will buy and bring food and blankets to the homeless.<br/>
<br/>
To sum up, there is one important thing that you have to remember: the help of each of you can make the difference.</p>
<p>We believe that even our small project can become reality.</p>

Sure enough, there are some people like you who are willing to give even only one dollar to help someone.
So we have decided to add to our research this real project: and that’s why we are starting our crowdfunding campaign .
At this time here in Italy it’s winter  and the months between January and Mach are the coldest ones.
Since Milan is a big city, there is a strong homeless presence : lots of people fight against cold and hunger in order to survive day by day.
By looking around you, you can realize in few seconds the cruelty of this reality that most of the people ignore. An enormous amount of people live alone on the street and, in the hope to receive a coin, they have to spend their days sat on the sidewalk.
Moreover, these people are considered invisible from the rest of community because of the other citizens’ indifference.
In  Milan, as in most of the cities of the world, there are charity associations that have the willingness to help the homeless, but especially in this tough period they are not able to face this issue.
For these reasons, we have decided to be part of this situation, but in order to become more effective we need even your help, because only four people can’t bring any kind of help, but an entire community can change this situation.
Using the collected money, we will buy and bring food and blankets to the homeless.

To sum up, there is one important thing that you have to remember: the help of each of you can make the difference.
We believe that even our small project can become reality.
Thank you

Allow me to introduce myself and offer a warm thank you, in advance, for all considerations and contributions. I am L'Angela ""Honeysuckle Moon"" Lee, Louisiana Handcraft Artisan, Apothecary, Herbalist, Natural Skin Therapist, Organic Spa Developer, Plant-Based Wellness Educator, Presenter and Writer. Mama and Sista to Many... Every day since March 2006, I've served as the Chief Product Developer of Honeysuckle Moon Natural Skin Care. This is a labor of love that began in my Family home in a small, bayou town in North Louisiana. My life path has proven that I am among the Ones who are Divinely chosen, ordained and guided to do this work. Apothecary offers me countless opportunities to help others learn natural, effective approaches to self-care, condition redirection and wholistic well-being. I serve the Most High JAH by providing excellent service to the People, continually expressing the highest gratitude for my African and Native Ancestors' LOVe, cosmological intelligence, healing abilities and connection to nature. My vision of creating a plant-based wellness arts reality manifests in the forms of handcrafted skin wellness recipes, spa therapies and culinary cravings from a kitchen that cares for individuals, families and artists who take their health and happiness to heart. These jars and bottles are being filled with unparalleled levels of LOVe, wisdom, integrity and quality. Day by day, Honeysuckle Moon Natural Skin Care offers a distinctive approach to herbalism, aromatherapy and apothecary that has traveled across the U.S., Canada, Jamaica, London, Zimbabwe and South Africa. My philosophy of self-care with plants and minerals reaches many, as the number of inquiries, consultations, units sold and bookings for festival, conference and expo dates continue at an incline. For what it's worth, I have been working as grassroots, touring artisan and product developer who seizes a multitude of opportunities annually, from farmer's markets, art shows, wellness conferences, corporate vendorships and music festivals. Each year, my travel itinerary allows me to reach thousands of people and share the healing knowledge that Mother Nature extends to me as I introduce my Roots, Trees and Flowers wellness platform to the world. </span></p>

A Natural Skin Therapist who produces herbal preparations and skin condition remedies by hand, travels to share her mission and teach the People about the power of melanin and the countless benefits of embracing a plant-based wellness lifestyle. A few years ago, at such a crucial phase in operations, the confines of a brick and mortar would have been too isolated for my goals of  industry visibility, so the Roots, Trees &amp; Flowers: Herban Wellness Lounge with Honeysuckle Moon was established as a pop-up natural spa and wellness arts studio that could travel  and introduce/service prospects to my work from market to market. The Lounge offers an interactive wellness space, with minimal commitment, that celebrates our skin's ability to be sacredly maintained, prepared, rejuvenated, redirected and, ultimately, resurrected through the proper integration of healthy herbotanicals, plants and minerals. Each recipe continues to be formulated and crafted by hand to meet the unique needs of varying skin and hair types. Since 2006, only one person (me) has remained responsible for Honeysuckle Moon's business formation and maintenance tasks, conceptualization, formulation, production, packaging, technical writing, graphic design and product photography, direct and web-based marketing, direct and web-based retailing, coordination, wellness education, consultations, contractual agreement management and mail order duty. Now, urban farming has been added to the list... It's a wildly kaleidoscopic life, I know. With this stated, I connect with the truth that it is time to reach more people, and because of this, more hands will have to be cultivated. More jars have to be filled and more independent work opportunities have to be devised and implemented for successful market saturation.

Everything is done in the Spirit of keeping the People healthy as I strive to remain a small-batch, handcrafted wellness product line that celebrates the power of melanin. Because of all of the art which I, personally, produce with just this one heart and set of hands, I am confident that I am ready to teach others my proven methods as an apothecary and achieve the goal of mass production by hand. </span></span></p>

<p><span class="""" style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;"">In addition to maintaining the ongoing operational expectations of Honeysuckle Moon Natural Skin Care and the Roots, Trees and Flowers: Herban Wellness Lounge, in Spring and Summer 2014, with the expert directives of Fresh 2 Health's Charles Greenlea, urban farmer and wellness educator, we began cultivating a series of potted tropical plants and indigenous planting mounds on the prototype property just outside of Atlanta, Georgia. I became quite curious to see what we could grow... In addition to activating my green thumbs and an increasing number of fingers, many hours have spent communicating with the plants to ensure livity and well-being for all who will benefit from their growth and nutritional attributes. As an artist who wishes to live positively and in optimal health, I am doing the self work, removing the limitations my mind once knew in an effort to live harmoniously on the earth's biorhythm, keep LOVe present and continue to learn what is required to embody the faith and purpose of a mustard green seed. I receive it as a vast blessing that I have been granted the reawakening of an ancient knowledge base and will to survive, thrive, grow my own vegetables, flowers and herbs, ultimately, taking care of myself and others with plants and minerals. It's become a necessary task that I assist others in learning how to create these sorts of life boosts for themselves and others, too. </span></p>
<p><span class="""" style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;"">In the year 2014, we grew the following hearty herbs, plants and superfood greens on a .35 acre private property outside of Atlanta, Georgia: Chamomile, Lemongrass, Honeysuckle, Jamaican Pumpkin, Gardenia, Rose, Sugar Cane, Dinosaur and Curly Kale, Collard and Mustard Greens, Broccoli Rabe, Bok Choy, with Broccoli and Onion on the approach... Spring and Summer 2015 planting goals include: Pot Marigold, Hyssop, Red Clover, Burdock, Aloe Vera, Catnip, Tomatoes, Sage, Lavender, Muscadine, as well as, several varieties of Mint, Basil and Cucumber. As I have accomplished with the yieldings of my winter garden, once mature, these plants  will be harvested and integrated into our plant-based wellness recipes and product formulation processes. </span></p>
<p><span class="""" style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;"">My beloved Lemongrass (A hoop house will be purchased to accommodate more plants year-round) grew from a 5 inch plant to one that is over 3 feet in height! The heart-shaped leaves in the pot is Jamaican Pumpkin... In the native planting mound below, our Bok Choy, Kale and Mustard Greens are looking Irie! The Broccoli Rabe was just harvested for the first time around New Year's Day and we enjoyed the florets thoroughly. Organic, Natural Livity is the Lesson.</span></p>

Greetings + Introduction to the Lady Behind the Work
 Peace and good day! Allow me to introduce myself and offer a warm thank you, in advance, for all considerations and contributions. I am L'Angela ""Honeysuckle Moon"" Lee, Louisiana Handcraft Artisan, Apothecary, Herbalist, Natural Skin Therapist, Organic Spa Developer, Plant-Based Wellness Educator, Presenter and Writer. Mama and Sista to Many... Every day since March 2006, I've served as the Chief Product Developer of Honeysuckle Moon Natural Skin Care. This is a labor of love that began in my Family home in a small, bayou town in North Louisiana. My life path has proven that I am among the Ones who are Divinely chosen, ordained and guided to do this work. Apothecary offers me countless opportunities to help others learn natural, effective approaches to self-care, condition redirection and wholistic well-being. I serve the Most High JAH by providing excellent service to the People, continually expressing the highest gratitude for my African and Native Ancestors' LOVe, cosmological intelligence, healing abilities and connection to nature. My vision of creating a plant-based wellness arts reality manifests in the forms of handcrafted skin wellness recipes, spa therapies and culinary cravings from a kitchen that cares for individuals, families and artists who take their health and happiness to heart. These jars and bottles are being filled with unparalleled levels of LOVe, wisdom, integrity and quality. Day by day, Honeysuckle Moon Natural Skin Care offers a distinctive approach to herbalism, aromatherapy and apothecary that has traveled across the U.S., Canada, Jamaica, London, Zimbabwe and South Africa. My philosophy of self-care with plants and minerals reaches many, as the number of inquiries, consultations, units sold and bookings for festival, conference and expo dates continue at an incline. For what it's worth, I have been working as grassroots, touring artisan and product developer who seizes a multitude of opportunities annually, from farmer's markets, art shows, wellness conferences, corporate vendorships and music festivals. Each year, my travel itinerary allows me to reach thousands of people and share the healing knowledge that Mother Nature extends to me as I introduce my Roots, Trees and Flowers wellness platform to the world. 











Roots, Trees and Flowers... Plant and Mineral-Based Spa Life for All
Between 2007-2010, I earned several spa certifications and graduated from Atlanta Institute of Aesthetics, which led to my acquiring a penalty-free license in Georgia that permits me to practice as a Natural Skin Therapist. A Natural Skin Therapist who produces herbal preparations and skin condition remedies by hand, travels to share her mission and teach the People about the power of melanin and the countless benefits of embracing a plant-based wellness lifestyle. A few years ago, at such a crucial phase in operations, the confines of a brick and mortar would have been too isolated for my goals of  industry visibility, so the Roots, Trees & Flowers: Herban Wellness Lounge with Honeysuckle Moon was established as a pop-up natural spa and wellness arts studio that could travel  and introduce/service prospects to my work from market to market. The Lounge offers an interactive wellness space, with minimal commitment, that celebrates our skin's ability to be sacredly maintained, prepared, rejuvenated, redirected and, ultimately, resurrected through the proper integration of healthy herbotanicals, plants and minerals. Each recipe continues to be formulated and crafted by hand to meet the unique needs of varying skin and hair types. Since 2006, only one person (me) has remained responsible for Honeysuckle Moon's business formation and maintenance tasks, conceptualization, formulation, production, packaging, technical writing, graphic design and product photography, direct and web-based marketing, direct and web-based retailing, coordination, wellness education, consultations, contractual agreement management and mail order duty. Now, urban farming has been added to the list... It's a wildly kaleidoscopic life, I know. With this stated, I connect with the truth that it is time to reach more people, and because of this, more hands will have to be cultivated. More jars have to be filled and more independent work opportunities have to be devised and implemented for successful market saturation. Task delegation and a subsubstantial budget will take my business to the next level that it deserves. Everything is done in the Spirit of keeping the People healthy as I strive to remain a small-batch, handcrafted wellness product line that celebrates the power of melanin. Because of all of the art which I, personally, produce with just this one heart and set of hands, I am confident that I am ready to teach others my proven methods as an apothecary and achieve the goal of mass production by hand. 


By upholding the original intentions of the Roots, Trees & Flowers Herban Wellness Lounge, our Green Life Art Space concept and design in progress aims to continue to introduce and deliver the artistry of sacred beautification and natural skin wellness, just in a way that's more accessible. A green-conscious day spa, production space and herban sanctuary that grows organic herbs, flowers and fresh veggies and fruit onsite is a refreshingly sustainable, community-friendly, concept to support. Novice prospects and our long-term clientele alike will come to a place that inspires them to free up and partake of the art, our plant-based recipes, skin care and condition-specific treatments. Enjoy our natural facials, customizable aromatherapy products, adornment services, foot reflexology, energetic spa therapies, wellness education, respites and eco-retreat dates. Ultimately, I wish to be able to help as many individuals develop strengthened wellness habits by integrating the Roots, Trees and Flowers philosophy into realistic, customized regimen. I feel really good about this journey as we evolve Honeysuckle Moon into a household name and global community resource for homegrown, handcrafted apothecary, value-added production, urban agriculture and healthy lifestyle planning consultation. 



In addition to maintaining the ongoing operational expectations of Honeysuckle Moon Natural Skin Care and the Roots, Trees and Flowers: Herban Wellness Lounge, in Spring and Summer 2014, with the expert directives of Fresh 2 Health's Charles Greenlea, urban farmer and wellness educator, we began cultivating a series of potted tropical plants and indigenous planting mounds on the prototype property just outside of Atlanta, Georgia. I became quite curious to see what we could grow... In addition to activating my green thumbs and an increasing number of fingers, many hours have spent communicating with the plants to ensure livity and well-being for all who will benefit from their growth and nutritional attributes. As an artist who wishes to live positively and in optimal health, I am doing the self work, removing the limitations my mind once knew in an effort to live harmoniously on the earth's biorhythm, keep LOVe present and continue to learn what is required to embody the faith and purpose of a mustard green seed. I receive it as a vast blessing that I have been granted the reawakening of an ancient knowledge base and will to survive, thrive, grow my own vegetables, flowers and herbs, ultimately, taking care of myself and others with plants and minerals. It's become a necessary task that I assist others in learning how to create these sorts of life boosts for themselves and others, too. 
In the year 2014, we grew the following hearty herbs, plants and superfood greens on a .35 acre private property outside of Atlanta, Georgia: Chamomile, Lemongrass, Honeysuckle, Jamaican Pumpkin, Gardenia, Rose, Sugar Cane, Dinosaur and Curly Kale, Collard and Mustard Greens, Broccoli Rabe, Bok Choy, with Broccoli and Onion on the approach... Spring and Summer 2015 planting goals include: Pot Marigold, Hyssop, Red Clover, Burdock, Aloe Vera, Catnip, Tomatoes, Sage, Lavender, Muscadine, as well as, several varieties of Mint, Basil and Cucumber. As I have accomplished with the yieldings of my winter garden, once mature, these plants  will be harvested and integrated into our plant-based wellness recipes and product formulation processes. 
My beloved Lemongrass (A hoop house will be purchased to accommodate more plants year-round) grew from a 5 inch plant to one that is over 3 feet in height! The heart-shaped leaves in the pot is Jamaican Pumpkin... In the native planting mound below, our Bok Choy, Kale and Mustard Greens are looking Irie! The Broccoli Rabe was just harvested for the first time around New Year's Day and we enjoyed the florets thoroughly. Organic, Natural Livity is the Lesson.






Our Bok Choy...Our Broccoli Rabe


Growth is Inevitable: Overcoming the Operational Ceiling


As much as part of me would like to continue working in accordance to the demands of this present entrepreneurial formula as a private practice apothecary, I have to respect the fact that my business of almost 9 years has reached its operational ceiling and can no longer survive in the capacity of a grassroots, real-time doing-business-as determined on the basis of what's the available balance in the account. It's time to confront the truth that my dream-space to kitchen to marketplace approach as a Black Woman-owned business has reached the level where it deserves a real, tangible budget for production increase, wellness education and wellness respites for artists and individuals interested in green life cultivation. This is the point where I must navigate the business strategy into more of one with a culture that equips and empowers communities with plant and mineral-based wellness tools, treatments, consultations, employment training, eco-retreats and wellness education. My relentless nature, professional ethic and ongoing commitment to our progress is ready to encounter, share and create professional opportunities with others who move along a comparable path. Forward...
The Roots, Trees and Flowers wellness platform is currently undergoing a bit of energetic construction as it expands to include stationary design, layout and logistics for the Roots, Trees and Flowers: Green Life Art Space. The first phase of design is scheduled to be initiated by Summer 2015 in one of the following states: Georgia, Mississippi and Louisiana. Kingston, Jamaica and Accra, Ghana are also being considered as international sites for the 2016-17 Community Wellness Handcrafting Partnership. Once the location has been set for 2015 production, interviews for apprenticeship with Honeysuckle Moon Natural Skin Care (2 slots available) will be conducted.

I've been raising and saving some money for sometime, and I'm almost there, I just need a little bit of a push over the edge to open up a local Pop shop where we can collect to our hearts content!If you don't know anything about the product go here but be warned they are addictive!I have the contacts and the merchandise all that's required now is a premises and everything that goes with it plus extra stock I may need to fill the space.What are we  offering that's different? Better prices and better selection! But not just that, we want to help others start their own Pop shops in their cities by giving advice and startup loans to others wishing to accomplish the same things
 We want to create a space where collectors can meet and discuss their collections buy to their hearts content and even use the store as a hub to trade your own pops!If this is something you would like become a Funko Founder because this is how we do it in the South West. We work together, and we need all of your help to create this.Please look at the numerous perks and be sure to especially look at the Gold Card Member perk! It's limited but it's a doozy and potentially could save you thousands.Not too shabby if we do say so if you want to be one of the privileged few!To anyone who wants to be a part of this, you're amazing.With regards to what I've accomplished already, I have a history of employment for international companies in both sales and marketing, and have already put away some capital to start this venture. I've observed the marketing to ascertain a niche , scouted a small location to rent, made contact with wholesalers, made deals with friends for masonry etc found second hand retail fittings and equipment studied the market, worked out the costings and the bare minimum I would need to getting running factored in internet/heating costs I've been working away at this for what feels like forever, reading every single business book, seeking out local entrepreneur groups and business mentors and arranged an account with the bank all I need now is the support to get this off the ground which I can only do with the support of the pop community and the small business community. Giving us a hand up this year would be an amazing thing to do.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Clean drinking Water for 4 KSH / Litre is
changing lifes for the People in Kisumu / Kenya. With your help?</strong><big><big><strong><br/>
</strong></big></big></p>
<p></p>
<big><big><b>No
access to clean drinking Water! Thats a real problem we should work on.</b></big></big>
<br/>
<p><br/>
I was born in Switzerland, 47 Years old, IT Consultant and Businessman
and I'm living since 6 Years here in Kenya. In Switzerland I was
""naturaly"" used to a perfect infrastructure offered by the Government.
I had to learn that this is not the norm and other places on this Earth
have big problems with basic needs.<b>
Here
in Kenya, Families are dealing with the most basic needs - DRINKING
WATER for there Family. We like to help the Families in Kisumu Kenya to
get a minimum of healthy and clean drinking Water to an affordable fair
price!</b></p>
<p><b><br/>
</b></p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446647308/wkscjblujkvvh1xtlltl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
 <br/>
<big><big><strong>UPDATE: Water-APP will
change the way of distributing Water (maji-app)</strong></big></big><br/>
<br/>
We designed a Watter-APP to run the Water business using a Smart-Phone
for the complete Water ordering process. At the moment we expect to have the first
version running before Cristmas so that the Water distribution can
start in the beginning of the Year.<br/>
<br/>
<ul>
<li>The functions of the Water-APP</li>
<li>Registration for Water-Kiosk owners and Water Customers</li>
<li>Water orders using the Water-APP</li>
<li>Payment of the Water order using MPESA mobile payment from
SAFARICOM</li>
<li>Coordination of Water Distribution by Distribution agents</li>
<li>Payment to Distribution agents using MPESA mobile payment</li>
<li>Coordination of capacities and future developement steps</li>
<li>Voting for next region for the second, third, ...Water plant</li>
</ul>
The design of this application is matching the lifestyle o Kenyans. The Smart-Phone is standing in the middle of there lifes. Doing shopping in Kenya and pay you bill by MPESA is convinient and more save than carrying cash.<br/><br/><br/>
<big><big><strong>What is the main economical problem? The Gap!</strong></big></big><br/>
<br/>
When you compare the income structures from Europe with Countries like
Kenya, you will recognize the real issues we have! <b>The
extrem Gap in the salary structure makes it simply impossible, that a
normal Family can use the Money they have to buy bottled Water in the
Supermarket.</b> It is far to expensive and only accessable for a
small group of top earners!<strong><br/>
<br/>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445847745/ypvd3gtkx5ziw5wczeqa.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</strong><br/>
<big><big><strong>70% have NO
access to clean
drinking Water!<br/>
<br/>
</strong></big></big>In places like Kisumu, <strong>70%
of the population has to
drink dirthy and poisonous Water</strong> from Lake Victoria or
little streams with Water, while clean Water is not affordable to them.
<strong>It makes them sick und nobody cares about it!</strong>
<p><strong></strong></p>

<br/>
<strong>IT IS OUR WISH TO CHANGE THIS FOR A BETTER WORLD! ARE YOU
WITH US?</strong><br/>
<br/>
Together with my Swiss Friend in Kenya, we decided to initiate the
project to help solving this problem in a sustainable way. <br/>
<br/>
<big><big><strong>The Water Situation Today</strong></big></big><br/>
<br/>
Clean drinking water is today in Kisumu only accessable and affordable
for the upper midle class and the upper class. More than <strong>50%
of the County Water supply is used by only 15% of the population</strong>.<br/>
<br/>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445843182/ibroeblqmmb72pcoswun.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
Streat dealers are selling this highly with Chlorine treated water for
2 KSH / Litre from door to door. <strong>Water in the
supermarkets costs approx. 25 KSH / Litre and is for the normal people
not affordable. The Monthly salary in the middleclass ranges from 5'000
KSH to 25'000 KSH (50 - 250 $)</strong>
<p></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445408141/zdj61pswegkfgq7gcsht.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<big><big><strong>Our target: Quality drinking water
for 4 KSH / Litre</strong></big></big>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>We like to build up a distribution channel for quality <strong>drinking
water to the Community for 4 KSH / Litre</strong>. The Community
gets access to the Water on Water Kiosks with there own cannes.
</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445843217/gworkoawjgoo7jjio9jl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<big><big><strong>We create Jobs!</strong></big></big>
<p>We only run the central Water Production centre. The Water
Kiosks, the
distribution and the sales channel is done by selfemployeed partners.
This creates new jobs for the community.</p>
<p><br/>
<big><big><strong>Sustainable business plan</strong></big></big><br/>
<br/>
We developed a business model to build up decentralized Water treatment
plants. Dezentralisation is helping us to cut down costs for transport.
This makes our Water more affordable and more accessible to the
community.<br/>
<br/>
We hope to install with your help until January 2016 the <strong>first
plant and produce up to 10'000 Litres of clean drinking water every Day</strong>.
When we reach 70% of sales, we will order the second machine to double
the production to 20'000 Litres per Day. And we go on and on and on
like this!!!</p>
<p><strong>We use a quality technology from Trunz Water
Systems AG
in Switzerland.</strong></p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p><big><big><strong>The first Water production
centre</strong></big></big><br/>
<br/>
We allready identified the location for the first Water production
centre. It is on a perfect location, save for the equipment and very
close to our first target Market, The Nyalenda B Estate with a
population of approx. 32'430 People can be served within a distance of
less than 300 Meter. The location has allready the needed roh Water
supply tanks, standby Generator and enough space to supply the Water to
Lorries with Water tanks. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<big><big><strong>Why and for what we need your Help!</strong></big></big><br/>
<br/>
We try at the moment to fund the project out of privat sources. The
fund raising here on gofundme.com is an additional way to fund our
project to start in a shorter period of time and in a bigger scale.<br/>
<br/>
All the internal costs for salaries, traveling, accomodation, planning
and integration of the phase 1 of our project is financed by us. <br/>
<p></p>
<p><br/>
<big><big><strong>We need your help for the main
investments:</strong></big></big><br/>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Treatment plant from Trunzwatersystems AG</li>
<li>Setup of the first production plant with storage
tanks and piping</li>
<li>For the customers we need to buy a first lot of Water
Containers with capacities of 10 Litre, 15 Litre and 20 Litre. </li>
<li>Setup of the first Two Water Kiosks</li>
<li>Registration costs on side of the Government</li>
</ul>
<p>It is our target to execute the Phase 1 of the project anyway.
We will
also try other crowdfunding sites to speed and scale up the project.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>AS MORE FUNDS WE CAN RAISE, AS FASTER WE MOVE ON TO PHASE
3 AND 4 AND 5 AND....<br/>
<br/>
</strong>Get inspired by another project with the same technology
implemented in January 2015 in Tanzania.  <br/>
NOTE: This is not our project, but it can help you understand the
impact of such projects in Africa and the appriciation of the Community.<br/>

Ich bin gebürtiger Schweizer, 47 Jahre alt, Menschenfreund,
EDV Berater und Unternehmer, nun seit
6 Jahren in Kenya. Von der Schweiz war ich mir ""natürlich""
eine
perfekte Infrastruktur gewöhnt. Das ist aber leider nicht
selbstverständlich! <b>Hier
in Kenya beschäftigen Familien aber noch andere Probleme. Wir

den Menschen in Kisumu / Kenya helfen eine minimale Grundversorgung mit
sauberem Trinkwasser zu einem fairen und für sie bezahlbaren

Die Entwicklung unserer Wasser-APP geht gut vorwärts, wir
werden voraussichtlich kurz bevor Weihnachten, so zu sagen als

Zeitplan passt auch zu unserem Aufbauplan für das Wasser
Produktionszentrum in Kisumu, welches wir anfangs Januar mit Eurer
Hilfe in Betrieb nehmen möchten.<br/>

<br/>
Wenn man die Einkommensstrukturen von Europa mit einem Land wie Kenya
vergleicht wird einem schnell klar, wo der Kern der Probleme liegt. Die
extremen Unterschiede in den Einkommen erlauben es einem grossen Teil
der Bevölkerung nicht, die absolution basis
Bedürfnisse wie zum
Beispiel Trinkwasser zu befriedigen.<b><br/>

Clean drinking Water for 4 KSH / Litre is
changing lifes for the People in Kisumu / Kenya. With your help?


No
access to clean drinking Water! Thats a real problem we should work on.


I was born in Switzerland, 47 Years old, IT Consultant and Businessman
and I'm living since 6 Years here in Kenya. In Switzerland I was
""naturaly"" used to a perfect infrastructure offered by the Government.
I had to learn that this is not the norm and other places on this Earth
have big problems with basic needs.
Here
in Kenya, Families are dealing with the most basic needs - DRINKING
WATER for there Family. We like to help the Families in Kisumu Kenya to
get a minimum of healthy and clean drinking Water to an affordable fair
price!


 

 
UPDATE: Water-APP will
change the way of distributing Water (maji-app)

We designed a Watter-APP to run the Water business using a Smart-Phone
for the complete Water ordering process. At the moment we expect to have the first
version running before Cristmas so that the Water distribution can
start in the beginning of the Year.


The functions of the Water-APP
Registration for Water-Kiosk owners and Water Customers
Water orders using the Water-APP
Payment of the Water order using MPESA mobile payment from
SAFARICOM
Coordination of Water Distribution by Distribution agents
Payment to Distribution agents using MPESA mobile payment
Coordination of capacities and future developement steps
Voting for next region for the second, third, ...Water plant

The design of this application is matching the lifestyle o Kenyans. The Smart-Phone is standing in the middle of there lifes. Doing shopping in Kenya and pay you bill by MPESA is convinient and more save than carrying cash.
What is the main economical problem? The Gap!

When you compare the income structures from Europe with Countries like
Kenya, you will recognize the real issues we have! The
extrem Gap in the salary structure makes it simply impossible, that a
normal Family can use the Money they have to buy bottled Water in the
Supermarket. It is far to expensive and only accessable for a
small group of top earners!



70% have NO
access to clean
drinking Water!

In places like Kisumu, 70%
of the population has to
drink dirthy and poisonous Water from Lake Victoria or
little streams with Water, while clean Water is not affordable to them.
It makes them sick und nobody cares about it!



IT IS OUR WISH TO CHANGE THIS FOR A BETTER WORLD! ARE YOU
WITH US?

Together with my Swiss Friend in Kenya, we decided to initiate the
project to help solving this problem in a sustainable way. 

The Water Situation Today

Clean drinking water is today in Kisumu only accessable and affordable
for the upper midle class and the upper class. More than 50%
of the County Water supply is used by only 15% of the population.


Streat dealers are selling this highly with Chlorine treated water for
2 KSH / Litre from door to door. Water in the
supermarkets costs approx. 25 KSH / Litre and is for the normal people
not affordable. The Monthly salary in the middleclass ranges from 5'000
KSH to 25'000 KSH (50 - 250 $)




Our target: Quality drinking water
for 4 KSH / Litre


We like to build up a distribution channel for quality drinking
water to the Community for 4 KSH / Litre. The Community
gets access to the Water on Water Kiosks with there own cannes.



We create Jobs!
We only run the central Water Production centre. The Water
Kiosks, the
distribution and the sales channel is done by selfemployeed partners.
This creates new jobs for the community.

Sustainable business plan

We developed a business model to build up decentralized Water treatment
plants. Dezentralisation is helping us to cut down costs for transport.
This makes our Water more affordable and more accessible to the
community.

We hope to install with your help until January 2016 the first
plant and produce up to 10'000 Litres of clean drinking water every Day.
When we reach 70% of sales, we will order the second machine to double
the production to 20'000 Litres per Day. And we go on and on and on
like this!!!
We use a quality technology from Trunz Water
Systems AG
in Switzerland.


The first Water production
centre

We allready identified the location for the first Water production
centre. It is on a perfect location, save for the equipment and very
close to our first target Market, The Nyalenda B Estate with a
population of approx. 32'430 People can be served within a distance of
less than 300 Meter. The location has allready the needed roh Water
supply tanks, standby Generator and enough space to supply the Water to
Lorries with Water tanks. 





Why and for what we need your Help!

We try at the moment to fund the project out of privat sources. The
fund raising here on gofundme.com is an additional way to fund our
project to start in a shorter period of time and in a bigger scale.

All the internal costs for salaries, traveling, accomodation, planning
and integration of the phase 1 of our project is financed by us. 


We need your help for the main
investments:


Treatment plant from Trunzwatersystems AG
Setup of the first production plant with storage
tanks and piping
For the customers we need to buy a first lot of Water
Containers with capacities of 10 Litre, 15 Litre and 20 Litre. 
Setup of the first Two Water Kiosks
Registration costs on side of the Government

It is our target to execute the Phase 1 of the project anyway.
We will
also try other crowdfunding sites to speed and scale up the project.

AS MORE FUNDS WE CAN RAISE, AS FASTER WE MOVE ON TO PHASE
3 AND 4 AND 5 AND....

Get inspired by another project with the same technology
implemented in January 2015 in Tanzania.  
NOTE: This is not our project, but it can help you understand the
impact of such projects in Africa and the appriciation of the Community.





Our kind request!

People in Kisumu are suffering about that Water issue. Please help us
to solve this problem together. Let us give Kisumu...


Please tell your Friends about our Project.

Thank you!
Andreas Koller

Was sind wirkliche Probleme
dieser Welt?

ein um 3 Minuten verzögertes „wichtiges
Geschäfts E-Mail“?
  
ein Stromausfall, der in der Schweiz alle drei Jahre
für
10 Minuten vorkommt? 
ein Unterbruch des Internets für mehr als 30
Minuten? 

Ich frage Dich nun, sind das wirkliche
Probleme oder sind
wir in der westlichen Welt so in der Hektik des Tages
gefangen,
dass wir dies als wahrhaftes Problem ansehen?
Die Einleitung zum Thema im Video von Peter
Baumann!


Kein sauberes Trinkwasser! Ein
wirkliches Problem.


Ich bin gebürtiger Schweizer, 47 Jahre alt, Menschenfreund,
EDV Berater und Unternehmer, nun seit
6 Jahren in Kenya. Von der Schweiz war ich mir ""natürlich""
eine
perfekte Infrastruktur gewöhnt. Das ist aber leider nicht
selbstverständlich! Hier
in Kenya beschäftigen Familien aber noch andere Probleme. Wir
möchten
den Menschen in Kisumu / Kenya helfen eine minimale Grundversorgung mit
sauberem Trinkwasser zu einem fairen und für sie bezahlbaren
Preis
zugänglich zu machen! 





UPDATE: Eine Wasser-APP revolutioniert den
Wasser Supply in Kisumu / Kenya

Die Entwicklung unserer Wasser-APP geht gut vorwärts, wir
werden voraussichtlich kurz bevor Weihnachten, so zu sagen als
Weihnachtsgeschenk die erste Version vorstellen können. Dieser
Zeitplan passt auch zu unserem Aufbauplan für das Wasser
Produktionszentrum in Kisumu, welches wir anfangs Januar mit Eurer
Hilfe in Betrieb nehmen möchten.

Die Funktionen der
Wasser-APP

Anmeldung für Wasser Kiosk Betreiber und Wasser
Kunden
Wasser Bestellungen mittels Wasser-App
Bezahlung des Wassers mittels MPESA mobil Zahlungsmittel
Koordination und Überwachung der Wasser Lieferung
Bezahlung des Lieferagenten
Koordination und Planung der Kapazitäten
Voting für künftige weitere
Betriebszentren nach Bedarf.


Der Kern der Probleme in Kenya

Wenn man die Einkommensstrukturen von Europa mit einem Land wie Kenya
vergleicht wird einem schnell klar, wo der Kern der Probleme liegt. Die
extremen Unterschiede in den Einkommen erlauben es einem grossen Teil
der Bevölkerung nicht, die absolution basis
Bedürfnisse wie zum
Beispiel Trinkwasser zu befriedigen.




Viele Familien in Kisumu
haben kein sauberes Trinkwasser! 
In Orten wie Kisumu / Kenya müssen 70% der
Bevölkerung
verseuchtes Wasser vom Lake Victoria oder kleinen
Bächen trinken, weil kein
anderes erschwingliches Trinkwasser zur Verfügung steht. Es
macht die Menschen
krank aber niemand kümmert sich wirklich darum.


Ich habe mich mit meiner Lebenspartnerin und zwei lokalen
Freunden dafür entschieden mein Leben diesen Problemen zu
dedizieren. Die
Unterschicht braucht Hilfe zur Selbsthilfe. Ich liebe die Menschen in
Kenya und
sie werden für unsere Unterstützung dankbar sein!


Die Situation Heute

Sauberes Trinkwasser steht zur Zeit in Kisumu nur der oberen
Mittelschicht und der Oberschicht zur Verfügung. Mehr als 50%
des aufbereiteten
Stadtwassers geht zu 15% der Bevölkerung, welche ans
Wassernetz angeschlossen
ist. 



Strassenhändler besorgen sich dieses Wasser vom
Stadtwerk, welches
eine sehr hohen Chlorin gehalt hat und verkaufen dieses Wasser von
Tür zu Tür
für 2 KSH pro Liter. Wasser vom Supermarkt
kostet in grossen Quantitäten ca. 25
KSH pro Liter was für die meisten Familien nicht
erschwinglich ist. Der
Monatslohn der unteren und mittleren Mittelklasse beträgt
5'000.- bis 25'000.-
KSH pro Monat (50 - 250$). 



Das genutzte Wasser macht die Menschen krank. Eine
Behandlung von Typhus oder anderen Viralen und
Bakteriellen Infektionen kostet
zwischen 3'000.- und 5'000 KSH.


Die Zielsetzung:
Trinkwasser für 4 KSH pro Liter
Unser Ziel ist es eine Versorgung
mit qualitäts Trinkwasser
aufzubauen, welches wir der Community zu 4 KSH pro Liter
verkaufen. Die Kunden
kommen mit Wasserbehältern zu unseren Vergabestellen, wo wir
die Behälter auswaschen
und mit sauberem Wasser auffüllen.

Unser Project macht es möglich,
dass 80% der Bevölkerung Zugang zu preiswertem
Qualitäts Trinkwasser erhalten.



Wir kreiren Jobs und
Geschäftschancen!
Für den Betrieb unseres Projektes benötigen
wir Frauen und
Männer Power. Wo immer möglich, werden wir lokalen
Arbeitskräften die
Gelegenheit geben, ihr eigenes Geschäft auf Grund unseres
Geschäftsmodelles
aufzubauen.


Transport
des
Wassers zum Kunden mit Motorrädern
    (Selbständige Motorradfahrer)


Betrieb
von
Wasser Verkaufspunkten (Frauen Selbsthilfegruppen)


Verkaufsagenten
und Verkaufsagentinnen
    (Selbständig mit wiederkehrenden Provisionen)


Hilfskräfte
in unseren Produktionszentren
(Angestellte)



Nachhaltiger Businessplan
mit Wachstumsstrategie
Ich habe einen Businessplan entwickelt welcher vorsieht, dass
wir in den nächsten Jahren dezentralisierte kleine Wasser
Aufbereitungszentren
aufbauen. Dezentralisierung hilft, die Transport Kosten herunter zu
setzen und
die Erreichbarkeit für die Menschen zu erhöhen.
Wir werden, hoffentlich auch mit Deiner Hilfe, bis
anfangs
Januar das erste System installiert haben, welches bis zu
10‘000 Liter pro Tag
produzieren kann. Mit diesem System starten wir das
Geschäft. Wenn wir eine Auslasten von 70 Prozent erreicht
haben, bestellen wir das nächste
System um die Kapazität zu verdoppeln. Dies wird dann mit
lokaler Finanzierung möglich sein.




(Wir nutzen für die Aufbereitung des Wassers
eine Schweizer Technologie der Firma Trunzwatersystems
AG. Meine Firma Swiss Kenko Co. Ltd. ist
registrierter Reseller für dieses Geräte in Western
Kenya. Dies erlaubt es uns die Kosten für die Geräte
minimal zu halten.)

So werden wir nach und nach einen grösseren Teil der
Community mit Trinkwasser versorgen können. Wir werden uns auf
Orte fokussieren
wo die Wassersituation ein dringendes Handeln benötigt. Das
sind viele!

Standort für erstes Wasser
Produktionszentrum

Wir konnten bereits den Standort für das erste Wasser
Produktionszentrum bestätigen. Der Standort offeriert bereits
eine

Lagertanks von 2 x 10'000 Liter gesichert, Notstrom agregate stehen uns

Einrichtung der ersten zwei Wasser Kiosks, welche dann von
Frauen selbständig betrieben werden
Registrierungsgebühren mit dem kenyanischen

Es ist unser gesetztes Ziel das Pilot Projekt (Phase 1) so oder so
durchzuführen. Wir werden gleichzeitig auf einer anderen
Crowdfunding Platform in englisch unser Glück versuchen. 

Wir lassen uns nicht stoppen! Wir tun es und Du bist
hoffentlich mit dabei.

Es ist einfach: 
JE MEHR GELD WIR BEREITSTELLEN KÖNNEN, JE MEHR LEUTE
WERDEN KURZFRISTIG SAUBERES WASSER ERHALTEN WEIL WIR GLEICH ZUR PHASE 2
UND PHASE 3 ÜBERGEHEN KÖNNEN. BITTE HILF UNS DABEI!


Risiken &
Herausforderungen
Wir wissen das die Einführung dieses Projektes
verschiedene
Herausforderungen für uns bereithält. Kenya hat
massive Probleme mit
Korruption, welche sich einfach gesagt in ALLEM findet. Du bezahlst
Geld um
einen Job zu bekommen, um für das Berufsmilitär
aufgenommen zu werden, um die
Polizei Kontrolle zu passieren, um eine Arbeitsbewilligung oder ein
Visa zu
erhalten. Korruption ist überall und in allem!
So werden wir auch mit unserem Wasser Projekt stehende
Strukturen aufbrechen, wo Leute heute an der desolaten Situation
profitieren.
Wir werden versuchen diese Leute zu integrieren und von der besseren
Qualität
unseres Wassers zu überzeugen. Wir werden sehen und angemessen
handeln! 
Es ist aus diesen Gründen wichtig, nahe mit den

<h3>A Conservation Success Story</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>This statue is a monument to the presence of our Island’s magnificent bears and their significance in our lives. It also commemorates Kodiak’s first registered bear guide, Charles Madsen, who established the Kodiak Guides Association in 1929 and worked with local Alutiiq natives to guide sportsmen from around the world. Alarmed by growing pressures on the bear population in the early 20th century, Kodiak guides, hunters, and others were important advocates for bear conservation: they championed the creation of Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge in 1941 to protect bears and their habitat. A true conservation success story and a testament to collaborative efforts, the Kodiak brown bear population has recovered and remains healthy.</p>
<p><i>A Brief History of the Statue:</i><br/>In 1955, the original “Madsen Bear” statue stood in front of the Kodiak Hotel, greeting visitors who arrived to Kodiak by boat. A mural at the dock proclaimed the Emerald Isle “Home of the World’s Largest Bear,” and the statue proudly rose above the channel. It survived the 1964 tsunami that devastated Kodiak’s harbor and downtown; as the community rebuilt and grew, it moved to different locations, including the Harbormaster’s building. In 2011, the bear statue found a fitting home outside of the recently-built Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge Visitor Center, welcoming everyone and reminding us all of the importance of bears in our community and island villages.</p>

<h3>Pork and Pickles</h3>
<p>Pork and Pickles is the new BBQ brick and mortar
restaurant started by food truck and catering company Lazy Farmer owned by chef
Chris Simard. Lazy Farmer started in 2013 after a year of organic veggie
farming left him wanting to get back in the kitchen. He bought a leaky, dilapidated
1967 vintage camper and converted it into a food trailer and started serving up
lunch around Burlington, VT. In 2014 he made a name for himself by getting into
all the major festivals, and serving food at local breweries in Burlington. In
2015 Lazy Farmer expanded to cater large events (weddings etc), in addition to
serving lunches, vending at events and serving at breweries.</p>
<p>After taking over the garage, kitchen, basement and dining
room it was time for Lazy Farmer to finally move out of the house.</p>
<p>In December 2015 Chris purchased an existing restaurant
space in Essex Junction, VT to double as a kitchen for Lazy Farmer, and create
a new BBQ restaurant called Pork and Pickles.</p>
<p>Why not call it Lazy Farmer Restaurant? Lazy Farmer has
established itself as a catering and food truck business and serves a wide
range of cuisines. It will continue to cater and serve a wide range of cuisines
out of a commercial kitchen.</p>
<p>Why call it Pork and Pickles? Through catering BBQ themes,
hearing lots of positive feedback from customers about BBQ, and traveling to
BBQ destinations, Chris has developed a passion for pork, BBQ, and pickling, so
he wants to create a BBQ concept restaurant to showcase this cuisine.</p>
<p><b>About the Chef</b></p>
<p>Chris was born and raised in Colchester, VT. He is a proud
8th generation Vermonter who has also lived in Boston, San Francisco, and lived
briefly while attending school in Ottawa and New Hampshire.</p>
<p>Chris has worked in food service for about 15 years
holding both back of house and front of house positions in independent and
national establishments. Chris attended Le Cordon Bleu in Ottawa, ON in
2002. While at school he became interested in where the food was coming from.
He then went to University of Vermont to study Ecological Agriculture. While at
UVM he worked part time at Tiny Thai Restaurant. After graduation he helped a
friend expand his farming business by selling produce to area restaurants
including Tiny Thai. With all of his savings and the money earned from the year
of farming, he started Lazy Farmer food truck. He has continued to work at Tiny
Thai during his slow seasons of Lazy Farmer allowing him to finance his
business entirely on his own.</p>
<p><b>Now What?</b></p>
<p>We purchased an existing restaurant with a little help
from Chris' Family and signed a lease in Dec 2015. The dining room needs some
renovation, the kitchen needs some renovation, and we still need some equipment
to get us going. With a little bit of your help we can avoid falling into
debt to get this restaurant off the ground. </p>
<p><b>Here is what we still need:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>A working walk-in cooler $2500</li>
<li>A dish sink $1000</li>
<li>A dishwasher $2000</li>
<li>Additional plumbing $1000</li>
<li>An indoor smoker $3500</li>
<li>Griddle $500</li>
<li>Signage $600</li>
<li>Dining room decorations and seating $1500</li>
<li>Bathrooms renovations $250</li>
<li>Dining room renovations $1200</li>
<li>Exterior renovations $1000</li>
<li>POS system $1000</li>
</ul>
<p>If we don't reach our
goal of $16,000 the funds raised will go towards improving the kitchen and a
bare bones build out of our dining room. Your contribution will help us keep
our heads above water while we start a new restaurant. </p>
<p><b>Here is what you get:
 </b> A new independently owned BBQ restaurant in Essex Junction.  </p><p><b>Please donate to help make Pork &amp; Pickles BBQ a reality!  </b>Thank you gifts for your greatly appreciated donations:</p><p>$25 Gets you a hug, Everyone needs a hug, and I'll give you the biggest one!</p><p>$50 Gets you a $50 gift card to Pork &amp; Pickles.</p><p>$100 Gets you a $100 gift card to Pork &amp; Pickles.</p><p>$150 Gets you one free dinner and a Pork &amp; Pickles T-shirt.</p><p>$250 Gets you an invite to our soft opening night with a free dinner and a Pork &amp; Pickles T-shirt.</p><p>$500 Gets you free dinner for 4 and a Pork &amp; Pickles T-shirt.</p><p>$1,000 Gets you the Lazy Farmer food truck at your house.  We will pull up and serve a party of up to 30 people at your house this season.</p><p>$5,000 Gets you a free private party for 20 people and a Pork &amp; Pickles T-shirt.</p><p>$10,000 Gets you free food for life and a Pork &amp; Pickles T-shirt and you can come to soft opening and get a hug! </p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Chris has shown that he achieves business success. He has
left a lasting mark on every business he has worked in, whether it is
establishing cleaning regime, improving management communication with staff,
motivating his peers, setting guidelines for organizational standards, doubling
sales at the farm, or growing Lazy Farmer from serving 10 customers a day to
catering weddings of 200, he has a proven record of achieving his goals.</p>
<p>Chris' education in both agricultural science and culinary
arts allows him to use his knowledge of agriculture to make informed decisions
on his purchasing as well as grow some produce himself as his focus is on
buying local and responsibly sourced ingredients. Supporting us supports the
rural economy of Vermont that makes this state such a unique and beautiful
place to live. We want to be part of your weekly routine allowing you to
support a local business that supports other local businesses.</p>
<p>Pork and Pickles is a casual BBQ restaurant. We will
fill a void in Essex Junction by being the only BBQ restaurant, as well as the
only ""farm to table"" restaurant that will offer meals at reasonable
prices you can afford to enjoy regularly. </p>
<p><b>Risks and Challenges</b></p>
<p>Everyone knows restaurants are risky businesses.
Fortunately our restaurant is backed by an established catering and food truck
business that can help carry us forward in the beginning.</p>
<p>We are all creatures of habit. It might be hard for us to
attract customers to a new restaurant. We have come up with a marketing plan

<p>How is
Chris going to run a catering business and a restaurant? He has enlisted the
help from people he has worked with over the past three years. He has the
support of trusted individuals that he knows can execute food and service to
his high standards. </p>

<p>Our love of attending festival events (especially music festivals!) led us to a major realization that something crucial was missing - <b>good</b> coffee. We have found that many events have no coffee vendors and if they do, usually features the standard espresso and hot coffee. This is unacceptable! Coffee is an essential part of our daily lives and we are passionately devoted to sharing the best of coffee culture with everyone. </p>
<p>Zovren Nitro Brews is happening regardless of the campaign's success but we would love your help to get us there faster! Your generous contributions will help us get our solar-powered mobile vending cart featuring the best independent nitro cold brew coffee on tap to all your favorite festivals and events in California. </p>
<div>Why Nitro Cold Brew Coffee?</div>
<div>The first time Co-Founder Kevin Waid tried cold brew coffee (at the insistence of Co-Founder Jourdan Waid) the experience instantly changed the way he viewed coffee. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The cold brew process eliminates certain compounds allowing for a smoother, less acidic coffee than hot brewed. The introduction of nitro cold brew added a whole new layer to the experience - even literally with the foamy head many might confuse for a stout beer. Infusing an already great cold brew coffee with nitrogen delivers a velvety and slightly sweeter result without the need for milk and sugar. Nitrogen also provides the pressurization to deliver the brews from the kegs to the taps, creating the foamy head. Think you don't like black coffee? Nitro cold brew coffee is likely to change your mind! </span>
</div>
<div><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span></div>
<p>Market Strategy &amp; Growth</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Zovren Nitro Brews will serve nitro cold brew coffee from local cafes committed to delivering the best cold brew blends possible. We have a couple brewers ready to go and eager to provide us their </span>unique creations to share with everyone!</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Our initial focus will be on special events such as music festivals, food &amp; drink festivals, street fairs, fundraisers, farmers markets, and catering for various private events like weddings, corporate events, and birthdays. Once we have more events than we can handle alone, our goal is to add additional carts and employees to serve at every event we can.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We will also be providing business coffee services to various companies for their employees and clients because we know all to well how important coffee is to a productive workplace. Zovren Nitro Brews will install a Nitro-on-tap cold brew kegerator in their business and periodically deliver fresh kegs of their chosen cold brew. Nitro cold brew coffee on tap at the office? Yes please!</span></p>

</div>
<div>Our custom solar-powered Nitro-on-tap mobile vending cart pours the brews utilizing a draft keg system very similar to what you see at any bar. The key difference is using nitrogen gas instead of CO2 for the kegs and delivery to the taps. </div>
<div>Main design features:</div>
<div>- Refrigerated main compartment is hidden within the outer shell that resembles our Zovren Nitro Brews emblem. Capacity to hold three 5-gallon kegs and nitrogen tank connected to a stainless steel tap tower for consistent cold drinks throughout the event. </div>
<div>- 150w solar panel and battery pack to support the eco-friendly and mobile concept. Many events don't provide electricity and a generator is beyond unappealing in most environments. Silent, renewable solar power is the answer! </div>
<div>- Dry storage compartment for our eco-friendly, biodegradable serving products to help reduce our footprint and influence a standard for responsible mobile vending.</div>
<div>- Small sink and tank to satisfy health department requirements <br/>
</div>
<div>- Custom LED totem towering over the cart flying a Zovren Nitro Brews logo flag to make finding us easy. Our logo is more than just a random design, can you find each letter of Zovren? One hint, the O is the center diamond. <br/>

Declaring sovereignty is a courageous action in our franchise-dominated beverage industry and we are proud to be supporting these beverage craftsman delivering the best nitro-infused cold drinks possible, starting with the finest nitro cold brew coffee we can find! 






Our love of attending festival events (especially music festivals!) led us to a major realization that something crucial was missing - good coffee. We have found that many events have no coffee vendors and if they do, usually features the standard espresso and hot coffee. This is unacceptable! Coffee is an essential part of our daily lives and we are passionately devoted to sharing the best of coffee culture with everyone. 
Zovren Nitro Brews is happening regardless of the campaign's success but we would love your help to get us there faster! Your generous contributions will help us get our solar-powered mobile vending cart featuring the best independent nitro cold brew coffee on tap to all your favorite festivals and events in California. 
Why Nitro Cold Brew Coffee?
The first time Co-Founder Kevin Waid tried cold brew coffee (at the insistence of Co-Founder Jourdan Waid) the experience instantly changed the way he viewed coffee. The cold brew process eliminates certain compounds allowing for a smoother, less acidic coffee than hot brewed. The introduction of nitro cold brew added a whole new layer to the experience - even literally with the foamy head many might confuse for a stout beer. Infusing an already great cold brew coffee with nitrogen delivers a velvety and slightly sweeter result without the need for milk and sugar. Nitrogen also provides the pressurization to deliver the brews from the kegs to the taps, creating the foamy head. Think you don't like black coffee? Nitro cold brew coffee is likely to change your mind! 


Market Strategy & Growth
Zovren Nitro Brews will serve nitro cold brew coffee from local cafes committed to delivering the best cold brew blends possible. We have a couple brewers ready to go and eager to provide us their unique creations to share with everyone!
Our initial focus will be on special events such as music festivals, food & drink festivals, street fairs, fundraisers, farmers markets, and catering for various private events like weddings, corporate events, and birthdays. Once we have more events than we can handle alone, our goal is to add additional carts and employees to serve at every event we can.  
We will also be providing business coffee services to various companies for their employees and clients because we know all to well how important coffee is to a productive workplace. Zovren Nitro Brews will install a Nitro-on-tap cold brew kegerator in their business and periodically deliver fresh kegs of their chosen cold brew. Nitro cold brew coffee on tap at the office? Yes please!







Our custom solar-powered Nitro-on-tap mobile vending cart pours the brews utilizing a draft keg system very similar to what you see at any bar. The key difference is using nitrogen gas instead of CO2 for the kegs and delivery to the taps. 
Main design features:
- Refrigerated main compartment is hidden within the outer shell that resembles our Zovren Nitro Brews emblem. Capacity to hold three 5-gallon kegs and nitrogen tank connected to a stainless steel tap tower for consistent cold drinks throughout the event. 
- 150w solar panel and battery pack to support the eco-friendly and mobile concept. Many events don't provide electricity and a generator is beyond unappealing in most environments. Silent, renewable solar power is the answer! 
- Dry storage compartment for our eco-friendly, biodegradable serving products to help reduce our footprint and influence a standard for responsible mobile vending.
- Small sink and tank to satisfy health department requirements 

- Custom LED totem towering over the cart flying a Zovren Nitro Brews logo flag to make finding us easy. Our logo is more than just a random design, can you find each letter of Zovren? One hint, the O is the center diamond. 





We have set a fundraising goal of $10,000 to bring our dream to reality.
Below is exactly how the money will be used:


Finalize our solar nitro-on-tap mobile vending cart

Coffee! Nitro Cold Brew Coffee Kegs for the initial events
Professional Signs & Marketing materials

Business license & Health Permit fees (really adds up when every city AND county requires a separate license!) 
Vendor fees for each event
Eco-friendly serving products (cups, straws, lids, napkins, etc)
Secure storage for equipment between events

When we exceed our funding goal, we plan to use the additional funds for:

Increased marketing such as free coffee happy hours and unique giveaways
Host a charity event benefiting animal rescue/adoption
Develop simple app for rewards program and event updates
Expand our menu options to include nitro-infused Tea & Juice! (Yes, nitro juice is as good as it sounds!)
Build an additional nitro-on-tap mobile cart enabling us to be at more events 

In return for your generous contributions, we have put together some 
really cool rewards you can actually use! Follow us on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram for updates and a personal shoutout thanking you for your contribution!! We cannot make this 
possible without your help and want to reward everyone - regardless of 
donation amount!

distillation replicates the way nature makes rain. The sun's energy heats water
to the point of evaporation. As the water evaporates, water vapor rises,
condensing on the glass surface for collection. This process removes impurities

distillation replicates the way nature makes rain. The sun's energy heats water
to the point of evaporation. As the water evaporates, water vapor rises,
condensing on the glass surface for collection. This process removes impurities
such as salts and heavy metals as well as eliminating microbiological organisms.
The end result is water cleaner than the purest rainwater. The still is a
passive solar distiller that only needs sunshine to operate. There are no
moving parts to wear out.By donating to this campaign you'd be helping to find sustainable solutions to one of the biggest problems facing humanity today;access to clean water.  Furthermore, Vanuatu is a prime place to start the project because 1) the need is very real and 2) the scale is manageable.The issue is acute.  Without clean drinking water many other developmental issues become secondary...gender equality, education, political corruption...because...  without water, people die.  We are hoping to raise USD 50,000.00 which will allow us to design and install fully automated solar distillation plants in three rural communities in Vanuatu.  Specifically we will:

Design appropriate solutions.  (i.e. consider each recipient community           individually, so that an appropriate amount of output water is produced, pumps are sized properly, and adequate storage facilities are provided for.)  


Specify and source suitable materials and equipment from reputable suppliers and get them to the work sites.  (Logistics in an island country can be tricky!  Local experience and standing is invaluable.)  

Ensure that installations are made to a very high standard.

Develop appropriate monitoring protocols in collaboration with the communities.  (Are the end users happy with the technological solution?  Are they willing to continue using it?)

Develop training materials and deliver training to recipient communities on the operation and maintenance (which is minimal) of their systems, so that operation and maintenance can be done without the need for external support.  (Local O & M is key to the sustainability of the project!)

Develop training materials and deliver trainings to local personnel on all of the above topics, so that this project can be replicated at other sites with a minimum of external input.  (I like this work :-) but an objective is for this to become a local initiative.) 

15+ recognition Contributors who give USD 15 or more will receive a ""One Solution Comes Up Every Morning"" bumper sticker so that they can show the world their commitment to renewable energy and its role in changing the world.30+ recognitionWe will happily give a music video/documentary of the project to contributors who give USD 30 or more.  This will not only immortalize the project in song, you will be able to say ""I made this project happen"" when sharing the video with friends and family.50+ recognition Contributors who give USD 50 or more will receive both the bumper sticker and the video as a special thank you gift from us.If we don’t reach our goal and are unable to work on solar distillation at any scale, we will donate the funds we have raised to agencies doing humanitarian relief work in  Vanuatu such as the Red Cross, CARE, Oxfam, Save the Children, and UNICEF, and account for these funds on this website.Aid agencies are predicting that the current drought will affect millions of lives in the region. They stress that access to clean water is essential for life. So be assured, every contribution will have a huge impact! It will put us a step closer to ensuring that everyone on the planet has access to clean water.We were very successful with our “Lighting Vanuatu” project (for which we won an Energy Globe award http://www.energyglobe.info/awards/national/awd...) We introduced solar lighting to thousands of households across Vanuatu.  And in so doing we changed lives! We are confident that this initiative will have an even greater impact, as “Water is Life.”We understand it can be difficult sometimes to make a financial contribution, but please also help us spread the word; let your friends and family and everyone on your social media network know about this campaign.Besides sharing this on your social media networks, please feel free to use the Indiegogo share tools!*(The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, Samuel Taylor Coleridge)",18.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h1>FAQ'S</h1>
<p><b>How can I contact you? </b></p>
<p>You can message us through your Indiegogo account, by leaving a comment (either privately or publicly) or by emailing us at heretohelpyou@thickandfinn.com</p>
<p>We usually respond with a few hours or faster :)</p>
<p><b>When will I receive my order?</b></p>
<p>We will start shipping orders in November and all orders will be shipped (leaving our warehouse) by Dec 7th so you'll be sure to receive it in time for the Holidays!</p>
<p><b>What is your return policy?</b></p>
<p><b>EXCHANGES: </b> Because we only sell products with the very best quality we are confident you will love them too.  If however, you need to exchange an item for other merchandise from our store you may do so by shipping it to us within 14 days of your purchase.  The item will need to be in salable condition and while we are covering the cost of shipping to you, the cost of shipping back to us will need to be covered by you.</p>
<p><b>RETURNS:  </b>Before items are shipped, returns can be made through Indiegogo. After you have received your items you have a 14 day return window.   The item will need to be in salable condition and while we are covering the cost of shipping to you, the cost of shipping back to us will need to be covered by you.</p>
<p><b>What can I do if there is a break in the yarn?</b></p>
<p>Our yarns are crafted of the finest quality 100% merino with care in Finland.  The Finnish take great pride in their work and do everything to assure their products are made to the highest of standards.  Still, when using only natural wool, variations in thickness and on very rare occasions a break in the yarn can occur.  If this should happen, you can either tie the ends together (and because the fabric created by fat yarns is super thick, imperfections are easily hidden) or you can use a felting tool to prick the fibers in the ends joining them together.</p>

""Tjockt yarn is, in my opinion, the highest quality yarn you can use for quick and beautiful knitting and crochet projects. It’s soft but durable and the color palatte is a great mix of classic and modern.”-Johnny Vasquez (New Stitch a Day/Argyle Sheep)


""I am so attracted to the drama that can be achieved with Tjockt/ThickandFinn yarns. I love how much can be creatively said with just one big, beautiful stitch. The fibers are sweetly soft to the touch and glide gracefully along the smooth wood of the companies large needles which are sized to be just right for their extra super bulky fibers. Having designed cowls in both Fat Fairy Merino & Tussah Silk and Fat & Fluffy Merino, I am looking forward to working with more of Tjockt/ThickandFinn's yarns.""Talitha Kuomi (Talitha Kuomi Designs)

<p>My name is Nicole Dennis, I live in a small town in Oregon with my husband and daughter surrounded by the beauty of our small farm. Every since I found out that I was pregnant I decided to live my life in a healthier way, from the inside out. Elderberry Boost was a product that we needed when we were all sick and I refused to buy the typical, chemical filled cold medicine. After buying one bottle of over priced, sugary elderberry syrup I realized that I could make a better version. Soon I found a local source for wild elderberries and began creating my own unique recipe. After some trial and error I had created my delicious Elderberry Boost.  Elderberry Boost is a delicious, all natural herbal tonic that helps to support the immune system as well as helping to shorten the duration of cold like symptoms. It is made with local, wild-crafted elderberries, local raw honey, organic raw apple cider vinegar, organic lemon juice, organic echinacea root and herb, organic stinging nettle leaf, organic cinnamon, organic cloves and ginger.  The positive feedback that I consistently receive is what motivates me to continue this business and take it to the next level. ( You can see the reviews and more at <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/yesitspure1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.facebook.com/yesitspure1</a> )</p><p>With your help in funding this campaign I will be able to raise the necessary funds to create a full production space for my business. My business has been growing for the last few years and it is on the verge of getting a lot bigger! In order to become successful and grow further I need to be able to produce a larger quantity of Elderberry Boost in an efficient way. There are a few larger Oregon based stores that are interested in carrying Elderberry Boost. I am hesitant to follow through with them because I know that I can not keep up with the quantities they will need. </p>
<p>This business allows me to create an amazing product that people everywhere need. Colds and sickness are a fact of life and being able to stay healthy is necessary so that you don't have to miss work, school or fun! I want to have my product available online and in stores so anyone can benefit from Elderberry Boost.</p>
<p>All contributions will go towards helping my business to have more production equipment. If my goal is met I will be able to create an entire production area solely for making Elderberry Boost. The area would be large enough that I could have a few people working with me as well. This is something that I really need but don't have the space for now. The funds raised from this campaign will also help with market research, hiring someone to do marketing and advertising, and designing new graphics to go along with the new business name that is scheduled to launch in January 2016. My current business name is Yes It's Pure and the new name that is scheduled to launch next year is, Abiqua Naturals.</p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">My goal for this campaign is $30,000. Although this may seem like a large amount, the majority of it will go towards creating a production kitchen. We have a large shop and my wonderful husband has agreed to section off a portion of it for my business. There will need to be permits, walls, roofing, insulation, flooring, electrical, plumbing, windows, ventilation and that's just the structure! After having a licensed contractor come out we realized that this part alone will cost right around $20,000 to get the job done properly. The remaining $10,000 will be used to purchase all of the interior kitchen items as well as helping with marketing and design work. In the kitchen I will need to have the basic requirements to get licensed as well as the specific equipment that I need. This includes multiple large sinks, large propane stove, propane tank, stock pots/ steam kettles, refrigeration, a large dehydrator and more.  Industrial kitchen equipment is very expensive and we will do our best to purchase refurbished whenever possible. </span></p>
<p>At every level of contribution you will have the opportunity to receive amazing perks. If you love my business idea but can't make a large contribution please know that even a small donation is helpful. One of the fantastic perks is a year supply of Elderberry Boost delivered to you every month, along with a surprise product each month. You can keep this for yourself or share with others! Another fantastic perk is a Yes It's Pure party at your house for you and 3 friends. I will show you how to make an amazing organic sugar scrub that you can personalize with the scents you like, and you'll also get Elderberry Boost and other products for every person. There are many other perks at a variety of levels so be sure to check them all out!</p>
<p>If my goal of $30,000 is not met by the end of the campaign you can be sure that your contribution will still be extremely beneficial to my business. All funds that are raised will help purchase some production equipment and larger sinks that I can use in my current work space. If you're wondering why I don't just keep using this space- well, it simply is not big enough for me to produce a larger quantity of product. This is a licensed secondary kitchen in my home and it is great for allowing me to make a few dozen bottles of Elderberry Boost at a time, but it is a tight space and is not adequate in many ways.</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>This project will allow everyone to have access to the best Elderberry Boost you can find. Even if you are not local you will be able to purchase online and have 1 bottle or a dozen bottles shipped right to you! My business has proven successful over the last few years and has gained a loyal following. I am confident that Elderberry Boost needs to be widely available in the near future. </p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>This business is not without its challenges. As I grow and make larger batches using new methods, it will take more trial and error to produce larger quantity while maintaining the same quality that my customers have come to value. I am confident that this is only a small hurdle and with a few test batches I will be able to master my recipe and method to create an amazing and consistent product, every time.</p>
<p> Knowing that I have gone from making small batches in my kitchen, canned in mason jars, to something that is now available in a handful of stores is what gives me the drive to keep expanding. </p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><br/><p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>

With your help Fresh Break will become the second restaurant in the nation to obtain a USDA certification and the first in Florida. 
By certifying our restaurant as Organic (as opposed to just using certain Organic ingredients on our menu) we are making a statement on the need for food operations to overlook the integrity of their purveyors and processes. Thus, we will create an environment that is less damaging to our health and our planet´s, and more conducive toward well-being and harmony.
By supporting Fresh Break´s certification process and healthy lifestyle campaigns, you will foster a domino effect that will permeate the food industry and society.                                                       
 Your contribution will help us fund:

We currently represent seven independent fiber and jewelry artists and a rotating group of painters and sculptors in our small shop in Cortland, NY. I've been given the opportunity to apply for a citywide Microenterprise Grant for Magpie but I must supply 10% equity to have access to the money.  This is where you can help!  Please consider making Magpie's holiday season merry by contributing toward my goal.  Here is how Microenterprise Grant funds will help my business work smarter and faster:
-an updated and functional computer system
to streamline the shop's retail procedures (no more handwritten receipts! Hooray!);
-advertising funds to assist in spreading
the word about Magpie’s offerings outside the immediate city of Cortland;
-a dedicated website to drive online
sales and outreach (so many of you have asked for this!);
-additional machinery and supplies
(i.e. sewing machines, sergers, tables, scissors, thread, fabric, manuals,
etc.) so we can start holding classes;
-funds to hire a part-time
administrative assistant/bookkeeper to assist with business operations; thus freeing up the seamstress to create more work;
-ability to hire several part-time
assistants to help on the shop floor and teach classes.Though business is quite robust,  I'm still just covering day to day expenses.

<p>Above is a picture of the applications that were received by the Justice Service Commission in Nairobi,Kenya. With rampant nepotism, tribalism and corruption, what are the chances of a qualified candidate getting a fair shot?<br/></p>
<p>My name is Joan Osogo, an entrepreneur, mother, avid reader and full time optimist. I recently graduated from the University of Southern California, Marshall School of Business and immediately returned to my home country of Kenya after 15 years of living abroad. I was excited to come back and make positive change, especially given that as a child I lived in poverty in one of Kenya's slums known as Huruma. As a child, I always dreamed of somebody coming to save me from the filthiness, drug &amp; alcohol use, crime and hopelessness that is the slum life. Through working hard at school, I was able to secure a visa to France where I worked as an au pair, after which I moved to the US and fast forward 15 years, I decided to come back to Kenya to save a young child in my former predicament.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434441496/xxktavqw8zq4fwfof7yb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>Soon after my arrival, I quickly realized that Kenya is very different from the US, especially in the employment sector! The US has great systems in place, and if you work hard, you are rewarded for your hard work. In Kenya, not so much!Reuniting with alot of my friends, I realized that a majority of them are in the same place they were in 15 years ago, if not worse. Most are losing hope, which is ironical because  Kenya's economy is rapidly growing, but unfortunately this growth is only witnessed by the wealthy and connected. I would like to change that, and with your help I know we can create a career development agency that creates a pathway to a stable career for people who have worked hard in their universities and colleges.  I would like to adopt the US system in Kenya especially the internship 
&amp; mentor ship programs that ensure that students get a glimpse into 
their future careers. <br/></p>
<p>With your help, we will be able to set up a career development agency that will act as a link between the rapidly growing companies in Kenya, both local and international. Our goal is to have a year round agency that does much more than just find jobs for prospective candidates. We plan on holding recruitment fairs, job readiness workshops, resume writing workshops, business etiquette lessons and so much more. All of this requires capital, especially given that there are virtually no public work spaces from which we can operate. Your contribution will help with paying rent, salaries, administrative costs, supplies etc. We estimate that a size able percentage of the funding will go towards renting a work space, a cost that we have come to realize is necessary in this busy city. This said, we plan on bootstrapping as much as possible, just like our company name, Jitahidi, means. Our plan is to outsource most of our services, opting to use virtual offices and holding training programs at hotel lobbies until we are able to scale the agency. With your help, we will be able to give bright, college educated youth who are not connected or from the elite class, a shot at life! Below is a caption from the Daily Nation, Kenya's leading newspaper, on how foreign direct investments have more than doubled, but you would not know of this if you made a visit to the slums. The situation in the slums and lower middle class neighborhoods have remained the same if not worsened due to ever increasing living costs. We would like to change that!<img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our estimates is that we will need $100,000 to cover our annual expenses. 30-40% of this amount will go towards getting premises for us to conduct business. Even though we prefer to outsource everything and have virtual offices, we realize that we will have to pay for hotel lobbies where we will hold recruitment fairs, resume writing workshops, networking events and so on. 20% of the budget will go towards advertising, 20% will go towards salaries and administrative costs with the rest going towards paying for supplies, website and other miscellaneous costs. Jitahidi Inc is already registered in the US and we are in the process of having it registered here in Kenya.<br/></p>
<p>We have great perks to show you our gratitude for your support! Since our company is located in Kenya, we thought it would be great to give perks that are made in Kenya, and that will hopefully give you a taste of Kenya!</p>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With your help, we will be able to bring some much needed transparency and a level playing ground for the Kenyan youth. I believe that hard work should be rewarded, and I saw first hand in the US how they reward people who work hard and have inbuilt systems that ensure that the right people are rewarded. Everything from internships, recruitment fairs, career development workshops, resume fairs and information sessions where companies come on campus and talk to students about opportunities with them and why they should work for them. These and other programs are almost impossible to find in Kenya! I was shocked to find out that getting an unpaid internship, something that in theory should be very easy to get, is almost impossible to get in Kenya unless you are connected. The level of nepotism in this country makes me wonder what hope the youth have as they graduate from college and head for the real world. In my Strategic Management class at USC, I had constant conversations with one of my  professors,  Professor Phil More,  about my project. He would listen and give his thoughts on the project. One day, he casually said, ""So you basically want to do what what the University and its career placement office does?"" At the time, I did not think much of it and gleefully answered ""Yes!"" But now, after 6 months on the ground, I realize that this task is easier said than done. There is a lot that will be needed to get word out about our project, to get the supplies needed to train the candidates, and most importantly to get the opportunity to provide manpower to the multinational companies in Kenya. The following is a list of some of the multinational companies that are currently in Kenya: Google, IBM, Toyota, Deloitte, PriceWaterhouseCoopers, Ernst &amp; Young, Coca Cola, Citi, Shell and so much more. I believe that these companies will be interested in creating a pathway for bright disadvantaged students to begin a career with them and with your help, we can make this a reality. </p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I started this project  in my Sophomore year in college. I was excited to look for an internship in my home country of Kenya, and when I inquired with the Career Center, I was informed that there were no internships to Kenya. There were no systems in place to provide students with an opportunity to work in Kenya, and right there a bulb went off. I knew that Kenya was a great destination, and upon inquiring with my fellow classmates, majority of them expressed a great interest in interning in Kenya during their summer holidays. And thus Jitahidi Inc was born! While taking my Business Writing class with my now mentor and advisor, Professor Clark Hansen, the business idea was crystallized because the class focused on poverty alleviation and social entrepreneurship. With Professor Hansen's help, I was able to work out a business plan that was both socially sustainable and had an impact on society. The more we thought through the business plan, the more we realized that there was a dire need for this agency.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Once we are fully established. we plan on creating internship and career opportunities in Kenya for US university students in order to expand their world view and bring some much needed skilled labor to the Kenyan </span>work space.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">  I registered to compete for the New Venture Seed Competition, organized by the Lloyd Greif School for Entrepreneurship, the Entrepreneurship school of USC. At the time, my business idea was not yet well developed so I did not place in the competition, and determined, I went on to compete for 1000 Pitches, a campus wide competition held by Spark SC to find business ideas from students. This time around, I was more prepared and had fine tuned my business plan, and was able to make it to the finals, representing the top 10% of pitches that were received. Although I did not win the competition, needless to  say making it to the finals  re- energized my quest to get Jitahidi Inc off the ground. Since that competition, I have registered Jitahidi Inc in the US, and have moved to Kenya to make the company a reality.</span></p>

<p>The risks and challenges that we face is that it is hard to bring change to a society that is set in its ways! The wealthy and connected have no reason to change the society because it favors them, while the poor have no power to demand change! Corruption, tribalism and nepotism are deeply rooted in this society, and without the help of companies both local and international that will partner with us to create a level playing field, it will be close to impossible to change the system.

Soon after my arrival, I quickly realized that Kenya is very different from the US, especially in the employment sector! The US has great systems in place, and if you work hard, you are rewarded for your hard work. In Kenya, not so much!Reuniting with alot of my friends, I realized that a majority of them are in the same place they were in 15 years ago, if not worse. Most are losing hope, which is ironical because  Kenya's economy is rapidly growing, but unfortunately this growth is only witnessed by the wealthy and connected. I would like to change that, and with your help I know we can create a career development agency that creates a pathway to a stable career for people who have worked hard in their universities and colleges.  I would like to adopt the US system in Kenya especially the internship 
& mentor ship programs that ensure that students get a glimpse into 
their future careers. 
With your help, we will be able to set up a career development agency that will act as a link between the rapidly growing companies in Kenya, both local and international. Our goal is to have a year round agency that does much more than just find jobs for prospective candidates. We plan on holding recruitment fairs, job readiness workshops, resume writing workshops, business etiquette lessons and so much more. All of this requires capital, especially given that there are virtually no public work spaces from which we can operate. Your contribution will help with paying rent, salaries, administrative costs, supplies etc. We estimate that a size able percentage of the funding will go towards renting a work space, a cost that we have come to realize is necessary in this busy city. This said, we plan on bootstrapping as much as possible, just like our company name, Jitahidi, means. Our plan is to outsource most of our services, opting to use virtual offices and holding training programs at hotel lobbies until we are able to scale the agency. With your help, we will be able to give bright, college educated youth who are not connected or from the elite class, a shot at life! Below is a caption from the Daily Nation, Kenya's leading newspaper, on how foreign direct investments have more than doubled, but you would not know of this if you made a visit to the slums. The situation in the slums and lower middle class neighborhoods have remained the same if not worsened due to ever increasing living costs. We would like to change that!


   What We Need & What You Get
Our estimates is that we will need $100,000 to cover our annual expenses. 30-40% of this amount will go towards getting premises for us to conduct business. Even though we prefer to outsource everything and have virtual offices, we realize that we will have to pay for hotel lobbies where we will hold recruitment fairs, resume writing workshops, networking events and so on. 20% of the budget will go towards advertising, 20% will go towards salaries and administrative costs with the rest going towards paying for supplies, website and other miscellaneous costs. Jitahidi Inc is already registered in the US and we are in the process of having it registered here in Kenya.
We have great perks to show you our gratitude for your support! Since our company is located in Kenya, we thought it would be great to give perks that are made in Kenya, and that will hopefully give you a taste of Kenya!
Some of our perks...
Canvas oil drawings & paintings.


Beautiful beaded sandals.





Handwoven baskets.
 







Colorful Maasai shukas.



Beautiful Maasai beads and necklaces.

In the case that we do not reach our goal, the funds raised will go towards setting up a website for Jitahidi, paying for the hosting of our first event, paying for advertisement costs all dependent on how much funding we secure. 
    The Impact
With your help, we will be able to bring some much needed transparency and a level playing ground for the Kenyan youth. I believe that hard work should be rewarded, and I saw first hand in the US how they reward people who work hard and have inbuilt systems that ensure that the right people are rewarded. Everything from internships, recruitment fairs, career development workshops, resume fairs and information sessions where companies come on campus and talk to students about opportunities with them and why they should work for them. These and other programs are almost impossible to find in Kenya! I was shocked to find out that getting an unpaid internship, something that in theory should be very easy to get, is almost impossible to get in Kenya unless you are connected. The level of nepotism in this country makes me wonder what hope the youth have as they graduate from college and head for the real world. In my Strategic Management class at USC, I had constant conversations with one of my  professors,  Professor Phil More,  about my project. He would listen and give his thoughts on the project. One day, he casually said, ""So you basically want to do what what the University and its career placement office does?"" At the time, I did not think much of it and gleefully answered ""Yes!"" But now, after 6 months on the ground, I realize that this task is easier said than done. There is a lot that will be needed to get word out about our project, to get the supplies needed to train the candidates, and most importantly to get the opportunity to provide manpower to the multinational companies in Kenya. The following is a list of some of the multinational companies that are currently in Kenya: Google, IBM, Toyota, Deloitte, PriceWaterhouseCoopers, Ernst & Young, Coca Cola, Citi, Shell and so much more. I believe that these companies will be interested in creating a pathway for bright disadvantaged students to begin a career with them and with your help, we can make this a reality. 
This is currently how numerous job advertisements are done, in print, in the newspaper. Not only is this approach not effective but it also locks out the poor who can not afford to pay Kshs 60 ( $0.63) everyday to find job advertisements! There is a need for a more cost effective and productive way to link employers to job seekers.



I started this project  in my Sophomore year in college. I was excited to look for an internship in my home country of Kenya, and when I inquired with the Career Center, I was informed that there were no internships to Kenya. There were no systems in place to provide students with an opportunity to work in Kenya, and right there a bulb went off. I knew that Kenya was a great destination, and upon inquiring with my fellow classmates, majority of them expressed a great interest in interning in Kenya during their summer holidays. And thus Jitahidi Inc was born! While taking my Business Writing class with my now mentor and advisor, Professor Clark Hansen, the business idea was crystallized because the class focused on poverty alleviation and social entrepreneurship. With Professor Hansen's help, I was able to work out a business plan that was both socially sustainable and had an impact on society. The more we thought through the business plan, the more we realized that there was a dire need for this agency.
Once we are fully established. we plan on creating internship and career opportunities in Kenya for US university students in order to expand their world view and bring some much needed skilled labor to the Kenyan work space.  I registered to compete for the New Venture Seed Competition, organized by the Lloyd Greif School for Entrepreneurship, the Entrepreneurship school of USC. At the time, my business idea was not yet well developed so I did not place in the competition, and determined, I went on to compete for 1000 Pitches, a campus wide competition held by Spark SC to find business ideas from students. This time around, I was more prepared and had fine tuned my business plan, and was able to make it to the finals, representing the top 10% of pitches that were received. Although I did not win the competition, needless to  say making it to the finals  re- energized my quest to get Jitahidi Inc off the ground. Since that competition, I have registered Jitahidi Inc in the US, and have moved to Kenya to make the company a reality.

   Risks & Challenges
The risks and challenges that we face is that it is hard to bring change to a society that is set in its ways! The wealthy and connected have no reason to change the society because it favors them, while the poor have no power to demand change! Corruption, tribalism and nepotism are deeply rooted in this society, and without the help of companies both local and international that will partner with us to create a level playing field, it will be close to impossible to change the system. Below is a newspaper announcement about employment fraud, in which a government agency was the victim!
 


I am optimistic that companies will be interested in employing qualified youth who do not have connections, because not only will they get skilled labor, but it will also help in their Corporate Social Responsibility.
I am a very resilient and tenacious person, I have graduated from one of the prestigious universities in America despite coming from very humble beginnings. 




With my business degree, exposure to the American workplace and passion to create opportunities for someone living in poverty, I believe that we will be able to overcome any hurdles that come our way. And besides, change begins with you and I to ensure that the next generation gets a fair shot at life. Granted, because my daughter is a US citizen, she already has an upper hand, but I would like to ensure that the other children she goes to school with here in Kenya, can also dream of a brighter future. It is only fair!

In theory, it's a very simple concept, but one we haven't seen executed as well as we know it can be. We're all experienced IT professionals that decided to do things the way they should be done, rather than the way they normally are. So, that being said, here's a general summary of our goals:</p> <ul>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">We want to provide corporate quality IT help to individuals, while still treating every customer, whether they're one person or a small business, like they're our closest friend.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Our approach is to bring the help to our customers rather than forcing them to seek us out and leave their important technology in our hands for days on in. When you hire us, we become your in house IT department. We want to be more convenient than the standard big box retail electronics store and those local computer shops, while also remaining fairly priced.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Upon the completion of this campaign, we plan to establish a presence in a number of major cities in the southeast. As of now, we are based out of Charlotte, NC and have services in Columbia, SC and Asheville, NC as well.

In theory, it's a very simple concept, but one we haven't seen executed as well as we know it can be. We're all experienced IT professionals that decided to do things the way they should be done, rather than the way they normally are. So, that being said, here's a general summary of our goals: 

We want to provide corporate quality IT help to individuals, while still treating every customer, whether they're one person or a small business, like they're our closest friend.


Our approach is to bring the help to our customers rather than forcing them to seek us out and leave their important technology in our hands for days on in. When you hire us, we become your in house IT department. We want to be more convenient than the standard big box retail electronics store and those local computer shops, while also remaining fairly priced.


Upon the completion of this campaign, we plan to establish a presence in a number of major cities in the southeast. As of now, we are based out of Charlotte, NC and have services in Columbia, SC and Asheville, NC as well. We will be expanding to Charleston and Savannah, and hope to continue our expansion into many other major cities. We will typically service anywhere within an hour of any of those cities, and hope that by establishing offices in multiple major cities, we can provide a level of technical expertise to communities that would otherwise lack them.

<div>I started my LYS (Local Yarn Shop) business 6 months ago. I decided not to go for funding at the time as I wanted to see if it was a viable proposition.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I have to say it has worked. I have paid all my bills (I haven't taken a salary but that is different) and expanded my product range, all just by income from the shop. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Now however I need help. For the least 6 months I have been renting (a small) space at a World Famous weaving mill. I am also their largest independent retailer of their unique yarns in the UK. These yarns are fantastic for many crafts not just weaving. We have a wonderful friendly relationship that is going to evolve in an unexpected way.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The mill is doing so well it needs to expand. They need to expand into my space, so I have to leave. Nothing else will change they will still be my suppliers etc. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We are looking for me to vacate at the end of August. </div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need </h3> <p>I need the deposit for a retail unit within walking distance of the City Centre. I need a space big enough to hold workshops. The weaving workshops are held in the darning room at the mill at the moment.</p>
<p>I will need to buy my own shop fittings, cash register, telephone et al ( everything I am using now belongs to the mill).</p>
<p>At this time I have the use of the mill's cone winding machine, so will have to buy my own. Most are three-phased, so I would either have to instal three-phase into the unit or convert the machine to 240v.</p>
<p>I would also need new stock (bigger place would require more filling). From customer feedback over the last 6 months they would like new and unique yarns from around the World, as well as unusual accessories.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 style=""letter-spacing: normal;"">The Break Down.</h3>
<div>
<b>Building and Move.     </b><i>£15,000      </i>This will be the biggest expense by far. It will include: 3 months deposit, 1 months rent. Possibly a survey will be needed if a repairing lease. Redecoration and signage. Installation or connection of telephone. PoS/cash register. Shop fittings and display units. Reprint of leaflets and advertising the move.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<b>Fees and Perks.   </b><i> £10,000.     </i>This section I believe speaks for it's self. If I don't reach my goal the fees will be higher, but the perks will be less. Obviously the reverse if I attain my goal.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><span><b>Cone Winding.    </b><i> £5,000      </i>This is for a cone to cone winder, delivered and installed.

<br/>
<p>That is the perfect solution. What happens if I don't reach my goal? After the fees and perk requirements. My first priority will be the building and move. I will get as much done as possible with the money. </p>
<p>After that I will continue as I have been up till now. As the shop earns enough it will be invested in new products.</p>

</div></div>","The Boring Business Bit.
I started my LYS (Local Yarn Shop) business 6 months ago. I decided not to go for funding at the time as I wanted to see if it was a viable proposition.

I have to say it has worked. I have paid all my bills (I haven't taken a salary but that is different) and expanded my product range, all just by income from the shop. 

Now however I need help. For the least 6 months I have been renting (a small) space at a World Famous weaving mill. I am also their largest independent retailer of their unique yarns in the UK. These yarns are fantastic for many crafts not just weaving. We have a wonderful friendly relationship that is going to evolve in an unexpected way.

The mill is doing so well it needs to expand. They need to expand into my space, so I have to leave. Nothing else will change they will still be my suppliers etc. 

We are looking for me to vacate at the end of August. 
   What I Need  I need the deposit for a retail unit within walking distance of the City Centre. I need a space big enough to hold workshops. The weaving workshops are held in the darning room at the mill at the moment.
I will need to buy my own shop fittings, cash register, telephone et al ( everything I am using now belongs to the mill).
At this time I have the use of the mill's cone winding machine, so will have to buy my own. Most are three-phased, so I would either have to instal three-phase into the unit or convert the machine to 240v.
I would also need new stock (bigger place would require more filling). From customer feedback over the last 6 months they would like new and unique yarns from around the World, as well as unusual accessories.

The Break Down.

Building and Move.     £15,000      This will be the biggest expense by far. It will include: 3 months deposit, 1 months rent. Possibly a survey will be needed if a repairing lease. Redecoration and signage. Installation or connection of telephone. PoS/cash register. Shop fittings and display units. Reprint of leaflets and advertising the move.


Fees and Perks.    £10,000.     This section I believe speaks for it's self. If I don't reach my goal the fees will be higher, but the perks will be less. Obviously the reverse if I attain my goal.

Cone Winding.     £5,000      This is for a cone to cone winder, delivered and installed. The price includes having an electrician converting it from 3-phase to 240v.
Extra Stock.     £5,000       Expand the ranges of the brands I already stock. Start to carry brands I have already approached, and source some new and exciting products.
Unforeseen.   £3000    If you want to hear God laugh make a plan.




That is the perfect solution. What happens if I don't reach my goal? After the fees and perk requirements. My first priority will be the building and move. I will get as much done as possible with the money. 
After that I will continue as I have been up till now. As the shop earns enough it will be invested in new products.


The Perks.


 No Thanks Needed Option.

<p>Amanda's Fight for her
Children</p>
<p>I am in despair of keeping my
children together and urgently necessitate your help.<span>  I have a five
(5) year old son, K and a three (3) year old daughter L.  They are the light of my life and I will do
whatever measures to keep them together. 
The siblings are very close and inseparable, always looking out for each
other.  They also have different Fathers,
which neither ever-showed concern nor desire to their responsibilities’.  </span></p>
<p>K’s father is a drinker and
is very heavy into smoking pot. Coming from a well-to-do family, his mother
financially supports him, with housing, utilities etc.; therefore, he does not
have to maintain steady employment. Shortly after K was born, his walked out on
us both.<span>  He left and moved into his
Mother’s house, abandoning us and leaving me to maintain a home for my infant
son and myself. </span></p>
<p>L’s father also comes from a well

party and adamantly, never wanted children. 
When I became pregnant with his child, he crossly evicted my son K and
me from his home, leaving us out on the street. 
</span></p>
<p>I have always been the
primary caregiver throughout the life of my children with extremely little help
from the fathers. I always maintained employment and my money goes solely to
the support for my children. It was not until I sought legal counsel for child
support that both fathers reached out, conversed and met. They both became very
good friends, spent much time together bonding, retained the same attorney and
both conspired to fight against me.<span>  Cost
was no issue for them as they both obtained financial assistance from their
parents. Despite that, K’s father who had a domestic violence injunction
against him and refused to submit a substance abuse evaluation was granted primary
custody. K’s father resides over 450 miles away.  Despite the fact that L’s father was
established an excessive alcoholic with enhanced temperaments, the Judge also
awarded him primary custody. L’s father lives 2 two hours away.  Based on the time-sharing schedule, I will
have the children 83 overnights a year and the fathers will have 282 overnights
per year. This is a cruel, deliberate unfairness which separates the siblings
from each other, their grandmother and myself. 
</span></p>
<p>My entire family, and my children
are devastated.<span>  From what I have learned,
this particular Judge notoriously “favors” fathers, with no regard for the
children or their mothers. I also have over 50 face book messages that support
this to be a fact.  My fight is not with
the fathers, but with the Judge. My children need to stay together and be
brother and sister, to grow together, enhance each other and share all the
normal things a brother and sister are supposed to do. Separating these
children will cause much heartache and infuse great anxiety for them. </span></p>
<p>My attorney fervently recommends
appealing to the District Court of Appeals as soon as possible to work to
terminate this injustice.<span>  The
transcripts are over $13,000.00 (over 1700 pages @ 8.00 ea.) along with
additional court costs and attorney fees. My mother, my family members nor I

And the second is Silk Road, the result of a collaboration with Behbud, a Pakistani organization that brings work opportunity, income-generating education, and healthcare training, turning underprivileged women into breadwinners in Islamabad.We have been selling our couture on several online platforms and at fairs across the United Arab Emirates. Since launching in 2012, we’ve come to see that this is a formula that works and that compassion can complement business and transcend borders.
THE ASKGiven the incredibly positive response to Babouka, we have decided that we’d like to spread the word about it to a larger, more global audience. We would also like to connect our customers with the seamstresses in a more profound way by showing them their stories and transporting them to their worlds.
Since our funds are limited (we are a non-profit), we need your help to fund a video about our work and mission. The video will be filmed in both Zanzibar and Islamabad, highlighting the work of the women and the story of the garments and the influence they have on people's lives from when the materials are sourced, to when they reach babies worldwide. 

We choose video because it is a highly effective, engaging format. This is no easy feat – creating this will require renting expensive equipment, hiring talented multimedia staff and funding them for pre- and post-production work, and financing flights/accommodation to both Zanzibar and Pakistan. But we believe that with the right support, we can make it happen.
Whether it’s $20, $100 or $500 your contribution will help raise important and necessary awareness about Babouka's talented female artisans. This video is the necessary step to take Babouka to the next level and create more opportunities for these women. To find out more about us, check out www.babouka.com.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>The Time Has Come</h3> <p>My name is Zachary McConnell. Ten years ago, I moved from Chicagoland to Fort Wayne. Between then and now, I got a bachelor's in marketing from Indiana Tech and worked at one of Fort Wayne's premier advertising agencies as a researcher for four years, and am now running my own research firm. But one thing that I love has been missing in Fort Wayne, and it's not deep dish pizza. </p>
<p>It is a world-class fragrance store.</p>
<p>For many years, I was content with the selection of fragrances at existing Fort Wayne retailers. But a vacation to California in the summer of 2008 changed my vision of what fragrance should be. By a stroke of luck, I met Kilian Hennessy of By Kilian, a niche fragrance brand with incredible fragrances - including the one that I am wearing as I am typing this story. As I bought more niche fragrances, I got compliments like crazy.</p>
<p>A few years later, mainstream fragrances didn't appeal to me anymore. Only niche ones did. And even though Fort Wayne is the second-biggest city in Indiana, the fragrance selection here isn't what it should be for a city of our size. People have to go online or wait for a vacation to another city to sample these great fragrances from around the world. </p>
<p>But this is a city where people want to stay local if they can. Take air travel. When I moved here, people wanted to fly out of Fort Wayne, but often found better options and fares out of Indianapolis. Our local leaders knew that, and began courting airlines for better business and leisure travel routes at competitive fares. Fast-forward a decade, and Fort Wayne International Airport just might have its best year ever in 2015. The same is true in Italian and Mexican restaurants, where the local options outnumber the chains.</p>
<p>I want to do the same thing with fragrance. Both me and Murat, one of my close friends with the same passion, want to build a store called Xscentrik (pronounced eccentric). Xscentrik features these unique niche brands from around the world, along with great European bath and body products that you also can't find here today. (Because we don't want to tip off the competition, we can't say the brands that we're targeting for day one and beyond. But we think you'll love them.) Unlike the stores of today, Xscentrik will make buying fragrances fun, with a one-of-a-kind no-pressure buying experience. And we want to build Xscentrik in downtown Fort Wayne - to be part of the downtown renaissance and to return fragrance shopping here to its Wolf and Dessauer roots.</p>
<p>And to do it, we want to accomplish a world first: build the first crowdfunded fragrance store on the planet. Xscentrik will be a store dedicated to the entire global fragrance community, and everyone who contributes will have their name listed at our entrance.</p>
<p>For people who are buying niche fragrances elsewhere, we want to be their new local source. For people who are buying mainstream fragrances, we want to have them smell what they've been missing. And that is why we are here today.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We are looking to get at least $100,000 to start Xscentrik by  the end of 2016. This money will be used for two core reasons: to purchase initial inventory and for initial payroll. A loan will be procured for our lease in downtown Fort Wayne, so the space can be renovated, and so technology can be procured. If we don't reach our entire goal, Xscentrik will still be a reality, but the money will be allocated to our existing consulting business first while we raise additional capital through consulting cash flow. Furthermore, we will be far more reliant on costly business loans that may weigh us down and inhibit our ability to bring in new brands for years to come.</p>
<p>Make no mistake: $100,000 is a lot of money. But if just 1,430 people decided to contribute $70 to our campaign instead of buying the most popular mainstream men's fragrance in the US for the same price, we will have exceeded our goal.</p>
<p>And what if you want to contribute more than $70? Well, we have four levels of perks that make it even more enticing to chip in. If you contribute $100-$499, you get a limited-edition T-shirt. If you contribute $500-$2,499, you get a signed poster of everyone that donated. If you contribute $2,500 to $9,999, you get a framed and signed fine art photograph of a downtown Fort Wayne landmark to be determined. And if you are one of up to five people that contributes $10,000 or more, you will be invited to our pre-opening dinner and launch party - one that is usually reserved for the local media and our vendors. (Per Indiegogo rules, please note that this does not include hotel and transportation.)</p> </div> <div> <h3>Making an Impact</h3> <p>To us, fragrance isn't just something that you put on after a shower. It is a lifestyle.</p>
<p>Both of us have a deep love and passion for fragrance - and for business, as both have business degrees. In our own unique ways, we have built their way in the business world from the bottom up, with major successes along the way. My friend is a master salesman who will provide unrivaled expertise, and I know the ins and outs of business from a marketing and technology standpoint.</p>
<p>And we want to make an impact on downtown Fort Wayne. People laughed in 2006 when plans for what is now Parkview Field were announced. Some wondered why they couldn't renovate the existing stadium. But Parkview Field was a home run - figuratively and literally. More downtown investment followed, like the Anthony Wayne Building renovation and the Ash Skyline project that is now under construction. Downtown retail is the last piece of the puzzle in this rebirth, and Xscentrik wants to be a core part of this.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risk Factors</h3> <p>Make no mistake: All businesses have risk involved, and I have seen many businesses come and go in Fort Wayne over the past decade. But we plan to use our expertise - and sell great products - to minimize and mitigate these risks.</p> <ul> <li>We may not be able to procure the initial targeted brands at launch. However, we have a full list of nearly 50 brands to consider over the next few years - a list that continues to grow.</li>
<li>Once open, competitors may try to copy or steal some of our brands. If this is the case, we won't fight it - we will simply move on to the next great thing.</li>
<li>People may use our store for showrooming. To minimize this risk, we will focus on carrying brands that do not sell their inventory to online discounters and the grey market at a price where it would be impossible to compete.

<div>Zach and Murat</div>
</div></div>","The Time Has Come My name is Zachary McConnell. Ten years ago, I moved from Chicagoland to Fort Wayne. Between then and now, I got a bachelor's in marketing from Indiana Tech and worked at one of Fort Wayne's premier advertising agencies as a researcher for four years, and am now running my own research firm. But one thing that I love has been missing in Fort Wayne, and it's not deep dish pizza. 
It is a world-class fragrance store.
For many years, I was content with the selection of fragrances at existing Fort Wayne retailers. But a vacation to California in the summer of 2008 changed my vision of what fragrance should be. By a stroke of luck, I met Kilian Hennessy of By Kilian, a niche fragrance brand with incredible fragrances - including the one that I am wearing as I am typing this story. As I bought more niche fragrances, I got compliments like crazy.
A few years later, mainstream fragrances didn't appeal to me anymore. Only niche ones did. And even though Fort Wayne is the second-biggest city in Indiana, the fragrance selection here isn't what it should be for a city of our size. People have to go online or wait for a vacation to another city to sample these great fragrances from around the world. 
But this is a city where people want to stay local if they can. Take air travel. When I moved here, people wanted to fly out of Fort Wayne, but often found better options and fares out of Indianapolis. Our local leaders knew that, and began courting airlines for better business and leisure travel routes at competitive fares. Fast-forward a decade, and Fort Wayne International Airport just might have its best year ever in 2015. The same is true in Italian and Mexican restaurants, where the local options outnumber the chains.

</div>","Hello,
we are two dreamers from Austria and Germany. We are traveling around the world in our old Mercedes Benz and a sponsored trailer tent from Camp-Let with a special mission.
Using our savings we started our trip in South America with the intention to travel through about 100 countries in 5 continents; meeting, sharing and recording people, seeing the wonders of their lands. 







Our traveling these past four months has been with very low expenses - we sleep in our tent or in cities in our car. We even get help from truck drivers to fill up our car with a couple liters of diesel at truck stops on the Panamericana Highway. To fill up our travel budget we sometimes has worked as a photographer with our camera and our drone.











So the first 15.000 miles worked out really well. But last week after all the good experiences we have made, we made one really bad one. Someone has broken into our car and stole nearly all our belongings. What us hurt most is the lost of our camera. And by bad luck, after four months of good work, our drone had a failure malfunction and is now broken.
So now we need your help to get back our equipment.


What we are doing - the project 5c100c 

Maybe you are wondering, why we are here under the category community? It is not only to get back our camera and drone, it is about to finish our project and complete our car with signatures from 5 continents and 100 countries. 
Along the way, everyone who has helped us in anyway, has signed with a special pen on our car.











And after our journey we are going to donate this car for a good cause on television for a project that benefits children.
Because there is no other similar car like this on the whole planet we really hope that we can raise hundred thousand dollars.




What we need

Before we had a Canon 70d with four lenses (70-200 L 2.8f, wide angle 11-22, 24-70 L 2,8f, 50-1,4f) and our dji drone phantom 2 vision+. The total cost were around 7000 $. But now we were thinking to buy a cheaper bridge camera and the drone, as we really need them to document the journey and our project. So the total cost will be 4000 $.


Rewards for your contribution

We have a lot of things to offer from pictures from the sky on your smart phone, over posters from our trip and signing our car to a visit from us.

Other ways to help:

- Even if you don't have a dollar left, you can share the campaign with all your friends, that would help us a lot.




- Follow our trip on Facebook 5c100c and give us a like.


- Or maybe you know somebody or a company who would like to sponsor two crazy people driving with an old Mercedes around the world for a good purpose.


Thank you so much for your support,

Melanie and Stefan

<p>Hi! </p>
<p>Thanks for showing interest in
Bespoke Community Development Company. We are a not for profit organisation
which aims to develop a radical new approach to engaging with the community in
the countryside, by promoting outdoor health, recreation and learning, in the
countryside around, Falkirk, Scotland. </p>
<p>Bespoke was founded in 2011, and has
been community owned and operated since day one, developing and building a
partnership with the local community and people who share our ethos of getting
people into the great outdoors!</p>
<p><b>How does Bespoke do this?</b></p>
<p>To date Bespoke has created and
maintained 67 km of mountain bike trails and multi-use paths closely linked to
the town of Falkirk. Over the last four years a number of highly beneficial
training programmes and events have been run off these trails, both by Bespoke
and other affiliated organisations. Through this we have gained the endorsement
and partnership of Falkirk Council, Mountain Biking Development Scotland and
Callander Estate. We have also generated a large membership and volunteer body,
and have now also been able to take on two permanent employees </p>
<p>At Bespoke, we are passionate about
developing a new model of operation, which engages with the community in a
self-sufficient, ecologically responsible and health promoting way. As a
community company we have developed, and maintained this ethos, turning the
paths we manage into a much loved and well used facility, not only for
recreation but also for learning and health. 
</p>
<p><b>Why we need you, internet: the sad story of the wind turbine</b></p>
<p>Bespoke has already done so much for
its community, but now we need you to survive. Right from the start we were
determined to develop a sustainable income stream so as not to be reliant upon
public funding and grants. We embarked on an ambitious project to develop a
community owned wind turbine. Bespoke relies heavily on public funding and our
wind turbine was our way of becoming completely self-sufficient. Not only would
the turbine generate clean and renewable energy for the local area, it would
have also generated a guaranteed and sustainable  income from 
the sale of electricity and receipts from the Feed in Tarrif.  100% of the income generated from the turbine
would have funded the activities of Bespoke, while also keeping in line with
our commitment to the sustainable and ecologically responsible management of
land. After four years of work, a successful planning application, several
grant applications and many hours of deliberation our wind turbine project has hit
a significant barrier due to a delay in completing legal agreements.  </p>
<p>The delay in our project means that the turbine
will be affected by <span>changes in government policy
at Westminster towards renewable energy. The income we were anticipating
generated from the Feed in Tariff scheme, has been dramatically cut under
George Osbourne’s recent budget anouncement. This has created uncertainty
around our project and we are looking for alternative funding sources until the
position is clarified</span>.</p>
<p>Sadly the dream of self-sufficiency
and the future of Bespoke is now looking decidedly shaky. The turbine was not
only intended to ensure that Bespoke was economically sustainable, it was
intended to be up and running by March 2016. 
Our current funding is diminishing and we need a bit of breating space to
develop an alternative long term strategy  </p>
<p>With no turbine, and no public
funding we could be out of cash by the middle of 2016. </p>
<p>This means we can’t:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Pay the wages of our staff  </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Maintain and develop our network of mountain bike trails</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Pay for insurance </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Continue to run community based events. </p>
<p>Without our valued staff we are no
longer able to operate at anything like the level we have over the last 4
years. The community hub that the trails have become will begin to diminish,
there will be no one carrying out routine maintenance, opportunities to develop
and expand the network will go and yet another community based non-for profit
will fall foul to our governments recent policy changes. </p>
<p>Over the last four years these trails
have become a well-used facility in our local area. They have facilitated the
promotion of mountain biking and outdoor activity and have only just begun to
allow for job creation in our community. The positive change that we have just
begun, could very soon be over without your help. </p>
<p>We need £53,689 to fund us over, while
we develop new plans for funding our work. 
With your help we can take this new support network and community hub of
walking paths and mountain bike trails to new levels. </p>
<p><b>Where your money would be going? Toward building a stronger and happier
community of course! </b></p>
<p></p>
<p>In total we need £53,689. A principal
breakdown of our yearly costs can be divided into four categories: </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span><b>Staff costs,
£37,560</b>. This is our most important costing, Bespoke currently employs a
dedicated team of individuals who are committed to the aims and aspirations of
Bespoke. Without their hard work and genuine commitment to their community
Bespoke would be a shell of what it is today. </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span><b>Insurance, £5115</b>. Maintaining those
paths and trails, working in the woods, using powerful machinery and of course,
holding events for Scotland’s mountain biking community. It’s a risky business,
and we need to ensure that all are activities are safe and risk accessed before
carrying them out. Insurance is essential and often a legal requirement for us
to operate. </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span><b>Vehicle and tractor
costs, £7783</b>. As an organisation that maintains mountain bike trails, getting around
the wooded areas in which we work is vital. Maintaining our pickup truck and
alpine tractor is central to our activities. </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span><b>Fuel costs and
equipment, £3231</b>. Bespoke is always looking for new and innovative ways to work with the
land that we manage, this means occasionally purchasing equipment to ensure
that our work is carried out in the most efficient and effective way possible
and of course we need fuel and oil to keep or vehicles and equipment running. </p>
<p>These are the four main areas to
which any funds generated will be going. Each plays a vital role in keeping
Bespoke ticking over, and we hope you think they are as important as we do! </p>
<p><b>Our way of saying thanks </b></p>
<p>Bespoke would like to thank those who
offer a contribution to our cause by offering a reward in return. For all
donations you will become a “Friend of Bespoke” and receive a regular
e-newsletter with updates on our progress and information about upcoming
events. In addition we will offer the following rewards depending on the size
of your donantion</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>£5 you will get your very own section of trail extending to 1.2m with a
certificate showing the location</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>£10 you will get your very own section of trail extending to 2.4m with a
certificate showing the location</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>£50 you will get your very own section of trail extending to 12m which
will include a specific trail feature such as a berm or rock drop off together with
a certificate showing the location</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>£100 you will get your very own section of trail extending to 12m which
will include a specific trail feature such as a berm or rock drop off with
naming rights (within the bounds of decency) together with a certificate

<p>·<span> 
</span>£500 we will build you your very own trail feature within an existing

feature or drop off. The design would have to accord to the grade of trail and
be approved by our trail designer. You will also have the naming rights (within
the bounds of decency) together with a certificate showing the location</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>£1000 we will build you your very own trail with features extending to

<p><b>What your contribution could mean</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Okay so far, you already know that
Bespoke has been instrumental in promoting mountain biking in our local area.
But apart from that we have been involved in a whole host of community based
projects that are either on going or have been seen to successful completion. </p>
<p>Maintaining the 67 km of mountain
bike trail and multi-use paths has been our primary area of focus, but in the
last four years we have always looked to expand, and diversify this
responsibility, by building new trails, and linking our facility up with the
wider area, as part of the <span>John
Muir Way project. The </span>John Muir Way, is a 100 m long network,
spanning from Dunbar to Loch Lomond built to celebrate the life of the famous
conservationist and father of the National Park Movement, John Muir. The Way

Falkirk</p>
<p>On top of linking our network up, since
Bespoke took over management of the trails in 2011, we have succeeded in building
16 km of new trail, to add blue and red trails to an area that was largely
green. What this has meant is that our trails are completely accessible, but
also cater for all levels of rider. The addition of our skills course has also
been a great success. All of these projects have been completed by fostering a

largely responsible for the construction of the trails, which are well loved
and used today.  </p>
<p>As well as fostering strong working
relationships with our supporters in the community, Bespoke has also worked
closely and successfully with several professional bodies, to ensure that our
facility is being fully maximised in terms of its benefit to the community. </p>
<p>Over the last two years for example
Bespoke has been running an employment training programme, in
conjunction with Falkirk Council, which provides rural skills training to young
adults facing long term unemployment. This training not only helps improve life
skills and the employment prospects of our participants but also helps to
maintain and develop the trail networks. To date the scheme has had several
success stories, with many finding full time employment including joining the
Bespoke team. Bespoke also works with local schools providing taster work
experience sessions and opportunities for outdoor learning</p>
<p>Bespoke’s activities have also
helped to encouraged local business growth. Due to our development and maintenance

employing local people. </p>
<p>If we cannot fund our running costs Bespoke’s

<p></p><br/></div>","Hi! 
Thanks for showing interest in
Bespoke Community Development Company. We are a not for profit organisation
which aims to develop a radical new approach to engaging with the community in
the countryside, by promoting outdoor health, recreation and learning, in the
countryside around, Falkirk, Scotland. 
Bespoke was founded in 2011, and has
been community owned and operated since day one, developing and building a
partnership with the local community and people who share our ethos of getting
people into the great outdoors!
How does Bespoke do this?
To date Bespoke has created and
maintained 67 km of mountain bike trails and multi-use paths closely linked to
the town of Falkirk. Over the last four years a number of highly beneficial
training programmes and events have been run off these trails, both by Bespoke
and other affiliated organisations. Through this we have gained the endorsement
and partnership of Falkirk Council, Mountain Biking Development Scotland and
Callander Estate. We have also generated a large membership and volunteer body,
and have now also been able to take on two permanent employees 
At Bespoke, we are passionate about
developing a new model of operation, which engages with the community in a
self-sufficient, ecologically responsible and health promoting way. As a
community company we have developed, and maintained this ethos, turning the
paths we manage into a much loved and well used facility, not only for
recreation but also for learning and health. 

Why we need you, internet: the sad story of the wind turbine
Bespoke has already done so much for
its community, but now we need you to survive. Right from the start we were
determined to develop a sustainable income stream so as not to be reliant upon
public funding and grants. We embarked on an ambitious project to develop a
community owned wind turbine. Bespoke relies heavily on public funding and our
wind turbine was our way of becoming completely self-sufficient. Not only would
the turbine generate clean and renewable energy for the local area, it would
have also generated a guaranteed and sustainable  income from 
the sale of electricity and receipts from the Feed in Tarrif.  100% of the income generated from the turbine
would have funded the activities of Bespoke, while also keeping in line with
our commitment to the sustainable and ecologically responsible management of
land. After four years of work, a successful planning application, several
grant applications and many hours of deliberation our wind turbine project has hit
a significant barrier due to a delay in completing legal agreements.  
The delay in our project means that the turbine
will be affected by changes in government policy
at Westminster towards renewable energy. The income we were anticipating
generated from the Feed in Tariff scheme, has been dramatically cut under
George Osbourne’s recent budget anouncement. This has created uncertainty
around our project and we are looking for alternative funding sources until the
position is clarified.
Sadly the dream of self-sufficiency
and the future of Bespoke is now looking decidedly shaky. The turbine was not
only intended to ensure that Bespoke was economically sustainable, it was
intended to be up and running by March 2016. 
Our current funding is diminishing and we need a bit of breating space to
develop an alternative long term strategy  
With no turbine, and no public
funding we could be out of cash by the middle of 2016. 
This means we can’t:
· 
Pay the wages of our staff  
· 
Maintain and develop our network of mountain bike trails
· 
Pay for insurance 
· 
Continue to run community based events. 
Without our valued staff we are no
longer able to operate at anything like the level we have over the last 4
years. The community hub that the trails have become will begin to diminish,
there will be no one carrying out routine maintenance, opportunities to develop
and expand the network will go and yet another community based non-for profit
will fall foul to our governments recent policy changes. 
Over the last four years these trails
have become a well-used facility in our local area. They have facilitated the
promotion of mountain biking and outdoor activity and have only just begun to
allow for job creation in our community. The positive change that we have just
begun, could very soon be over without your help. 
We need £53,689 to fund us over, while
we develop new plans for funding our work. 
With your help we can take this new support network and community hub of
walking paths and mountain bike trails to new levels. 
Where your money would be going? Toward building a stronger and happier
community of course! 

In total we need £53,689. A principal
breakdown of our yearly costs can be divided into four categories: 
· 
Staff costs,
£37,560. This is our most important costing, Bespoke currently employs a
dedicated team of individuals who are committed to the aims and aspirations of
Bespoke. Without their hard work and genuine commitment to their community
Bespoke would be a shell of what it is today. 
· 
Insurance, £5115. Maintaining those
paths and trails, working in the woods, using powerful machinery and of course,
holding events for Scotland’s mountain biking community. It’s a risky business,
and we need to ensure that all are activities are safe and risk accessed before
carrying them out. Insurance is essential and often a legal requirement for us
to operate. 
· 
Vehicle and tractor
costs, £7783. As an organisation that maintains mountain bike trails, getting around
the wooded areas in which we work is vital. Maintaining our pickup truck and
alpine tractor is central to our activities. 
· 
Fuel costs and
equipment, £3231. Bespoke is always looking for new and innovative ways to work with the
land that we manage, this means occasionally purchasing equipment to ensure
that our work is carried out in the most efficient and effective way possible
and of course we need fuel and oil to keep or vehicles and equipment running. 
These are the four main areas to
which any funds generated will be going. Each plays a vital role in keeping
Bespoke ticking over, and we hope you think they are as important as we do! 
Our way of saying thanks 
Bespoke would like to thank those who
offer a contribution to our cause by offering a reward in return. For all
donations you will become a “Friend of Bespoke” and receive a regular
e-newsletter with updates on our progress and information about upcoming

What your contribution could mean

Okay so far, you already know that
Bespoke has been instrumental in promoting mountain biking in our local area.
But apart from that we have been involved in a whole host of community based
projects that are either on going or have been seen to successful completion. 
Maintaining the 67 km of mountain
bike trail and multi-use paths has been our primary area of focus, but in the
last four years we have always looked to expand, and diversify this
responsibility, by building new trails, and linking our facility up with the
wider area, as part of the John
Muir Way project. The John Muir Way, is a 100 m long network,
spanning from Dunbar to Loch Lomond built to celebrate the life of the famous
conservationist and father of the National Park Movement, John Muir. The Way
runs from coast to coast and passes various landmarks including, the Kelpies
and the Falkirk wheel, and provides excellent access to some of Scotland’s most
beautiful areas. Our trails at Bespoke forms a vital linking part of this
network, which is now helping to invigorate a developing tourist industry in
Falkirk
On top of linking our network up, since
Bespoke took over management of the trails in 2011, we have succeeded in building
16 km of new trail, to add blue and red trails to an area that was largely

and used today.  
As well as fostering strong working
relationships with our supporters in the community, Bespoke has also worked
closely and successfully with several professional bodies, to ensure that our
facility is being fully maximised in terms of its benefit to the community.

<h3>Introduction to The Cabbage Patch</h3>
<p>Hello! I'm Mandy Weaver, owner and operator of The Cabbage Patch. We are an upscale resale boutique located in the heart of central Pennsylvania. Nine years ago the Cabbage Patch opened in a 1650 square foot retail space; with money I had saved from working and a shear desire to help a town so desperately damaged by the 2009 recession. My vision, was to “Create The Cabbage Patch as a place where anyone who has, knows or just plain likes children can save more of their hard earned money while purchasing clothing and accessories for their children”.</p>
<p>As our business evolved, we realized two things very quickly.</p>
<p>First, the need in our community for what we did was far greater than we first imagined. In some cases, having our store available to local families was the only way they could cloth their children without forgoing other necessities like food. While a large portion of our local population received assistance, an even larger amount stayed just above the poverty line rendering them unable to get the help they needed to provide for their children.  We quickly found way to  branch from our “cloth them mentality” to a, “provide for their needs” mentality.</p>
<p>Second, in a world full of ""fake"" we were able to give our customers some place ""real"". A place where they could come for comfort, empathy, comradery, a shoulder to cry on, a spring board to feed passions and business ideas, or just a place to come before you got to the edge of the rope you had been hanging on to. We have fostered a community over nine years that there can never be a price tag put onto.</p>
<p><img alt=""Google Logo"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;id=1-xUSWuj6Vu07Tv8g7abcRU5bPHGMk3sM"" src=""""/> </p>
<p>Through my business I have also been blessed to meet men and women who have created and run local non profits in our town that have told me stories of the hurdles they face in finding safe, comfortable, accommodations to grow. These nonprofits work with little to no budgets, especially youth managed organizations, so having a place to utilize for meetings, events, or simply internet access to conduct daily activities will be invaluable to them.</p>
<p>When the property we are purchasing became available there was no doubt in my mind that we would be able to utilize this property to further our mission to support our community through the products we sell and the culture we had created.  We are a central artery to the people of Hanover; we have supported them and their families. </p>
<p>With the purchase of this new facility we will be creating a non profit hub on the upper portion of the building. It will be a self contained office and conference space where local non profits will have access to internet, electricity, bathrooms heat and air conditioning. Many of our local non profits have such small budgets that they often meet outdoors or in peoples homes which does not allow for the most proficient use of their time and effectiveness. This space, will be available to them for their use all year long.</p>
<h2><u>How you can help</u></h2>
</div><div>
<p>The costs of building out this building and having it ready to open are around $40,000. We’ve already been approved for the loan to mortgage the building and through private donations we have enough for the down payment. So now we are asking our community and their villages to rally around us to raise the rest of the funds here on Indiegogo. We’re so close to being able to make this dream a reality and we hope you can help us close the gap. Any additional funds above and beyond our goal will go to improving the physical location, things that in our current plan are phase 2 buildout.</p>
<p> </p>
<img alt=""Google Logo"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;id=1Ln1G04B0cabEXJNe5CsDhauXE6wis3rl"" src=""""/>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your donation will have the potential to create a domino effect of impact. While your donation here goes towards the creation of this space, this space helps foster healthy families, healthy families create strong children, strong children have the self confidence to lead and go on to change this world we live in. At our core we not only reduce, reuse and recycle, physical products, we foster, cultivate and support our community. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest risk that comes with asking for funding when you are an established business is that people have trouble understanding why you can't just fund this yourself.</p>
<p>The thoughts that maybe the business isn't viable enough to do this, why didn't they save money over the years to fund this?</p>
<p>Trust me when I say, I could not be more ashamed of my 9 year ago self. I am ashamed that I did not, at that time, have the faith in myself and my ability to positively affect the world I live as much as we have.</p>
<p>I am ashamed that I didn't believe that my tiny store in a recession hit town could possibly be successful enough to even CONSIDER buying a building. </p>
<p>But 9 years ago, I did feel those things, and so I reinvested almost every penny back into the business and thought that donating to causes and running fundraisers was where that money should have been sent.</p>
<p>Now, fast forward and here I am. I own those past decisions that I have made and now I will not doubt the gifts I have been given to help those around me. </p>
<p>When I opened it was to serve my community it was to support people in their time of need. </p>
<p>We have made it our mission to serve these people and I will not fail them.</p>
<p>The new vision of the Cabbage Patch will be, “To serve the needs of our customers by providing goods and services online and instore to help them provide for their ever-growing families, whole fostering friendship and community”. No man or woman is an island and in the Cabbage Patch we are all family.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Can't donate? That's okay! Here are a few other ways you can support us:</p>
<p>Please spread the word, post this to your Facebook pages for us, tell your friends and family how we have benefitted you if we have. Please know that every share, every like, helps us to get one step closer to our goal. THIS IS HAPPENING!</p>

When the property we are purchasing became available there was no doubt in my mind that we would be able to utilize this property to further our mission to support our community through the products we sell and the culture we had created.  We are a central artery to the people of Hanover; we have supported them and their families. 
With the purchase of this new facility we will be creating a non profit hub on the upper portion of the building. It will be a self contained office and conference space where local non profits will have access to internet, electricity, bathrooms heat and air conditioning. Many of our local non profits have such small budgets that they often meet outdoors or in peoples homes which does not allow for the most proficient use of their time and effectiveness. This space, will be available to them for their use all year long.
How you can help

The costs of building out this building and having it ready to open are around $40,000. We’ve already been approved for the loan to mortgage the building and through private donations we have enough for the down payment. So now we are asking our community and their villages to rally around us to raise the rest of the funds here on Indiegogo. We’re so close to being able to make this dream a reality and we hope you can help us close the gap. Any additional funds above and beyond our goal will go to improving the physical location, things that in our current plan are phase 2 buildout.
 


The Impact
Your donation will have the potential to create a domino effect of impact. While your donation here goes towards the creation of this space, this space helps foster healthy families, healthy families create strong children, strong children have the self confidence to lead and go on to change this world we live in. At our core we not only reduce, reuse and recycle, physical products, we foster, cultivate and support our community. 

Risks & Challenges
The biggest risk that comes with asking for funding when you are an established business is that people have trouble understanding why you can't just fund this yourself.
The thoughts that maybe the business isn't viable enough to do this, why didn't they save money over the years to fund this?
Trust me when I say, I could not be more ashamed of my 9 year ago self. I am ashamed that I did not, at that time, have the faith in myself and my ability to positively affect the world I live as much as we have.
I am ashamed that I didn't believe that my tiny store in a recession hit town could possibly be successful enough to even CONSIDER buying a building. 
But 9 years ago, I did feel those things, and so I reinvested almost every penny back into the business and thought that donating to causes and running fundraisers was where that money should have been sent.
Now, fast forward and here I am. I own those past decisions that I have made and now I will not doubt the gifts I have been given to help those around me. 
When I opened it was to serve my community it was to support people in their time of need. 
We have made it our mission to serve these people and I will not fail them.
The new vision of the Cabbage Patch will be, “To serve the needs of our customers by providing goods and services online and instore to help them provide for their ever-growing families, whole fostering friendship and community”. No man or woman is an island and in the Cabbage Patch we are all family.

Other Ways You Can Help
Can't donate? That's okay! Here are a few other ways you can support us:

<p>greencents™ has
30 years of experience in energy conservation for homes and businesses. We have
a passion to educate consumers on how to make energy efficient choices so
consumers can save money and help the environment.  Energy efficient
products and regular home maintenance are being enjoyed by millions of homes
across the country. These homes see the benefit of lowering their energy bills
by installing energy efficient products and standard home maintenance. Reducing
your energy consumption leads to a healthier
home for your family and mother earth. Unfortunately,
the savings and health benefits from energy efficient practices are not shared
by low-income families, especially seniors across the United States.
The costs associated with installing low-power products and regular home
maintenance such as replacing air filters, keeps many families from
experiencing the advantages of a healthy home and keeping more money in their
pockets. Not to mention that most low-income seniors are physically unable to
perform tasks we all take for granted such as changing a LED light bulb.
greencents™ wants to bring awareness to the struggles low-income families
and seniors encounter in their daily lives by working with one of the best

<p>The greencents™ Energy Efficiency Campaign has partnered
with Meals On Wheels Atlanta’s Home Repair Services to educate
and help low-income seniors and their families with their energy consumption.
The goal of our campaign is to raise funds necessary to empower families to
lower their energy usage and improve the care of their homes and the
environment we all share. <span>Knowing
that just one energy efficiency kit can save a family over $800 in its lifetime is a great feeling and we look forward to helping as many families as
possible.  </span></p>

<p>Meals On Wheels Atlanta’s Home
Repair Services keep seniors' homes safer, drier, and
warmer through free and low-cost repairs and enhancements inside and out.
greencents™ wants to help spread MOWA vision that no Atlanta senior goes
hungry, cold, or forgotten. Their mission to support senior independence
through meals, shelter, and community is one we are proud to be a part of. Last
year MOWA served 230 seniors and 1,708 home repair tasks were completed. They
currently have a waiting list of more than 300 seniors in need of home
repair.  97% of seniors receiving home repairs are able to remain in their
homes and communities six months or more after services, and 98% of seniors
respond that their home was more safe and livable after services. </p><div>

<p></p></div>","Our Story
greencents™ has
30 years of experience in energy conservation for homes and businesses. We have
a passion to educate consumers on how to make energy efficient choices so
consumers can save money and help the environment.  Energy efficient
products and regular home maintenance are being enjoyed by millions of homes
across the country. These homes see the benefit of lowering their energy bills
by installing energy efficient products and standard home maintenance. Reducing
your energy consumption leads to a healthier
home for your family and mother earth. Unfortunately,
the savings and health benefits from energy efficient practices are not shared
by low-income families, especially seniors across the United States.
The costs associated with installing low-power products and regular home
maintenance such as replacing air filters, keeps many families from
experiencing the advantages of a healthy home and keeping more money in their
pockets. Not to mention that most low-income seniors are physically unable to
perform tasks we all take for granted such as changing a LED light bulb.
greencents™ wants to bring awareness to the struggles low-income families
and seniors encounter in their daily lives by working with one of the best
organizations out there, Meals On Wheels Atlanta.

</b></strong>The Boardwalk
Rehabilitation and Enhancement Project at the Cosumnes River Preserve is a project we are very excited about! The first phase consists of rebuilding 800+/-
linear feet of wooden boardwalk, 400+/- linear feet of concrete walkway, and
doubling the size of the existing viewing platform to accommodate
ever-increasing numbers of visitors and students. This portion of the Project is fully funded and construction will begin in August 2015. <strong><em><em><em>The portion of the Project that is still not funded</em></em></em></strong> is the addition of roof
over the enlarged viewing platform to create an outdoor environmental education
area for K-12<sup>th</sup> grade students, as well as an all-weather viewing
and photography area for visitors.<span>  In addition, a new
250 sq. ft. viewing platform would be installed near the boardwalk parking
lot at Pond 5 to further facilitate mobility impaired visitors viewing of winter
migratory waterfowl.  </span><span>The new viewing
platform also would be used for our volunteer “Ducks in Scopes” program that provides
visitors and student with the opportunity to get close and see and learn about the many
freshwater invertebrates that serve as a protein-rich diet for winter migratory
waterfowl and waterbirds.  </span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span>Each year over 10,000 K-12 students and 60,000 visitors flock to the Preserve to look, listen, photograph, and learn about more than 200,000 waterfowl, shorebirds, wading birds, and songbirds that reside and/or migrate to the Preserve each year. </span></p>
<p><span>The Cosumnes River Preserve encompasses over 50,000 acres of prime wildlife habitat in the California Central Valley. The Preserve provides vital freshwater wetland habitat for the many birds of the Pacific Flyway that migrate from as far away as the Arctic Tundra each winter. The Preserve hosts over 250 species of birds each year, some of which are listed by the State of California as threatened with extinction including, the greater sandhill crane. </span></p>

<p></p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>The 
Preserve has received $225,000  of the $296,000 needed in funding to replace and enhance the Boardwalk
Trail. Because the project was not fully funded the project as bid will <b>not</b> include the roof for the outdoor environmental education platform, or a new viewing platform in Pond 5.  The Preserve cannot afford those items without additional funding.  This leaves the Preserve short $71,000
in order to complete the project. We have tapped all the partners of the Preserve and there are no more funds available!</p>
<p>It is our hope that the rest of the project will get fully funded with the help of supports such as you!  If our goal falls short we will use the funds for one of the pieces of the project such as just the roof or just the new platform.  If we raise more money that our goal then Interpretive kiosks, additional seating, and the use of steel structures and/or other environmentally friendly products could be installed.</p>
<p>To
encourage you to help the Preserve in this endeavor and thank you for your support, <strong>we want to give you some really cool Cosumnes River
Preserve stuff!</strong>  Many of these items have never been offered to any entity in the past!  </p>

</p>
<p>The existing
boardwalk was built in the early 1990’s when the Preserve was in its infancy
and annual visitation averaged about 3,000 people.<span>  Today, the visitation and usage of the
Preserve’s boardwalk facility has outpaced the old and failing infrastructure.  Your donations will be used to help complete important portions of the Boardwalk Trail Rehabilitation and Enhancement project for the benefit of all visitors that come to experience nature at the Preserve.  </span></p>

</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> Without
your funding the Preserve will not be able to provide an all-weather, outdoor
environmental education area to support more than 10,000 K-12<sup>th</sup>
grade students and 60,000 visitors that come to the Preserve each year.<span>  The Preserve will not add a new viewing
platform to better accommodate mobility impaired visitors, and to support our
highly successful Ducks in Scopes program. 
As one of the Preserve’s most loved and most walked trails, it is
essential to maintain, and improve, the boardwalk facilities to provide the
absolute highest quality outdoor experience that we can to the visitors and
students that have come to know and love the Preserve’s wetlands, waterfowl,
and waterbirds.</span> </p>

</div></div>","Introducing InScrub
InScrub is dish washing device which gives you ability to clean inside surface.





Constructing

InScrub consists with two parts. First one/ device in which is rotating magnet and second one, sponge. There is magnet in the sponge too. 
Inside construction of InScrub

Sponges
Using:  1) drop sponge in the dish

             2) turn on magnet rotating device
             3) bring inscrub near the sponge from outside the bottle
             4) sponge with magnet inside will begin rotating
            5) with rotation sponge cleans inside surface of the dish


                                                     As Easy as on off


                                                              
Inside construction 

INscrub in action 


I started this project almost two months ago, whole designing engineering and inventing of the project was done by me. I have  knowledge in 3d designing 3d graphics, physics, electrical engineering and big experience in solving inventive problems.





As you see designing of the project is almost ended, but work done by me isn't professional and in these circumstance its almost impossible to manufacture good product. The biggest part of funding is needed to make lasted version of ""inscrub"". At the same time its very important to  well organized team to develop future business plan. Your activity will be  sign for me that, its worth to resume working on the project. 


All proceed from the inventing till testing have been done by me, at home :)



Project developing steps
1) Consultation with engineers in specific fields.

2) Consultation with business manager.
3) Creation of  lasted version of the product.




4) Making mass production model.
5) Using my apartment for testing and developing project. At the beginning , its enough to purchase some machines and materials:  compression molding, different type of plastic and small conveyor line for production.

My name is Dmitry
I’m GIS developer
and I want to share

with you


What is Mapfont

I work with online maps a lot, and I don’t like raster icons, they look bad on mobile devices and high resolution displays. I've been trying to find modern icons, but found nothing that I like.

I decided to use vector icons and now I use a font that you can connect to the site and that can be used on almost any online and desktop GIS.

I create symbols and support the site independently. Anyway, sooner or later I will finish this project. However, to recover labor costs and to my work quick and pleasant, I would like to raise $5000.

I want to create the following sets:








 
Transportation




 
Culture & Emtertaiment






 
Tourism



 
Road Signs





 
Indoor Navigation



 
Industry





 
Naval



 
Animals & Hunting





 
Plants & Agriculture



 
Military Infrastructure





 
Weather & Cataclysms




I'm working on this project in my spare time and plan to create about 500-1000 different icons
Also, I want to make several options for raster icons

You can download these right now on the website http://mapfont.org/ and use them for free
All new icons will appear on the website and you will immediately be able to download and use them with Google Maps, OpenLayer, Yandex Maps and many other online services and GIS

<p><br/></p><h3>What is needed...</h3><h3></h3><p>
</p><p>We are starting completely
from scratch in a building that is a blank concrete canvas with external walls
only. </p>
<p>These are approximate
costs of what is required:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>$100,000: To fit out a full coffee shop/cafe and build
the exclusion zone between the food area and the cat area.</p></li>
<li><p>$30,000: To build at least 3 toilets – male, female
and a disability/ambulant toilet as regulations require this.</p></li>
<li><p>$20,000 (possibly): For separate ventilation systems
for the café and the cat’s area.</p></li>
<li><p>$15,000: To build a separate kitchen/laundry area
where the cats can be fed, bathed, groomed etc. </p></li>
<li><p>$10,000: Legal fees and Accounting fees.</p></li>
<li><p>$20,000: minimum amount required for materials and
furnishings to fit out the cat area including paint, floorings, furnishings and
equipment etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to this, we
also have further costs including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Rental costs for the premise which include having a
security deposit of 3 months of rent being available.</p></li>
<li><p>Completion of the Online Booking System for the cats
area.</p></li>
<li><p>Permits and Approvals.</p></li>
<li><p>Cat adoptions and care expenses.</p></li>
<li><p>Staff recruitment and training.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We have ourselves invested
a great a deal into Capital Cat Café and will continue to do so. We have
sacrificed a lot both professionally and personally to make this happen. We are
committed to opening the Capital Cat Café as soon as possible and are doing
everything within our power to make that happen! If for some reason, we could
not open the cat café, we would return all funds raised through the crowdfunding
to the contributor and in the case that we could not make contact with a
contributor, we would donate those funds to animal welfare/rescues within the
Canberra area.</p><h3><br/></h3><h3>Not just another Cat Cafe...</h3><h3>
</h3><p>So you know what a Cat Cafe is?  Yep,
lots of cute cats to cuddle and relax with whilst enjoying a cup of coffee or
tea! You probably also have seen a crowdfunding campaign like this one for a
Cat Café as most have been set up through the generous support of
crowdfunders. So you are probably thinking what makes the Capital Cat
Café any different?</p>
<p>Well for starters, the Capital Cat Café
cats are not mere felines... They are all Prime Ministers of Australia,
Australian Governors General and ground-breaking Australian Federal
Parliamentarians!</p>
<p>At the Capital Cat Café you will be
able to meet Eddie aka Mr Edmund Barton, Australia’s very first Prime Minister!
You will also get to interact with Australia’s first female Prime Minister, Ms
Julia Gillard... ok, so not the real Julia Gillard, but our Julia is also an
intelligent, ginger-haired leader! They will be joined by many other
Kitty-Parliamentarians who are putting litter-wars aside and are forming their
own government at the Capital Cat Café and want to take on Parliament House as
Canberra’s must-see tourist attraction!</p>
<p>The Capital Cat Café will be completely
unique to Canberra and like no other Cat Café in the world! The cafe will
be fitted out to reflect the Australian Nation’s Capital and Canberra’s many
tourist attractions. The Kitty-Parliamentarians will have their own Prime
Minister’s Office and Cabinet Room along with a mini Canberra decked out with
all the facilities and equipment a cat could ever want or need!</p><h3><br/></h3><h3>Who are we?</h3><h3>
</h3><p>We are two sisters, animal lovers and
now full time crazy cat ladies! We have both worked in the social welfare and
community sector for many years and are passionate about helping people and
animals! The idea of a starting a Cat Café came from seeing the happiness that
our own cat <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/Zanda.thecat"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><u></u></span></a><u><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/Zanda.thecat"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Zanda</a></u> brought to people’s lives via his social
media. Our goal is to make the Capital Cat Café something that Canberra and
Australia are proud of. We have been working very hard all year to make the
Capital Cat Café a reality. It has not been an easy journey, but we are finally
getting there! </p>
<p><br/></p><h3>What you get...</h3><h3></h3><p>
</p><p>We are soooo thankful for your support
and for every single dollar contributed! We have a whole bunch of Perks we hope
you will take advantage of!</p>
<p>We think the best Perk is our “<b><u>Wall
of Honour</u></b>” Perk! Imagine your name and location fur-ever on the walls
of the café? That’s right the coffee shop part of the Capital Cat Café will be
covered forever with the names of the amazing people that supported us! We
would love to have people from all over Canberra, Australia and the rest of the
world! And we want you to be part of it!! </p>
<p>Here's what it is going to look
something like...</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436834701/bfncejqt2u0limvjemcf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
</p><p><br/></p><p>We also have an exclusive offer
especially for our Crowdfunders! A Cat Play Date Perk gets you pre-paid entry
to visit the cats at a special discounted price! </p>
<h3><br/></h3><h3>Cat welfare is our top priority!</h3><h3>
</h3><p>The welfare of the café cats is of the
upmost important to us. All the cats will be rescued or rehomed cats that reside
permanently in the Cat Café.  We are working hard to find and personally
choose cats with the right temperaments and personalities to enjoy and actually
thrive in a Cat Café environment. It is important to us to know the cats
individually, their needs and their quirks, prior to the Cat Café opening and
to do this we are currently building the team of Capital Cat Café cats. Our
commitment to our cats is for their life and to be responsible pet owners to
each cat we will provide for them for the duration of their lives, even after
they may need to be retired from the Cat Café.</p>
<p>The cats will live in kitty-wonderland
created just for them.  The Capital Cat Café will be their home. The cats
will not be available for adoption, however we will be supporting local animal
welfare and rescue groups and doing everything we can to promote animal
adoptions and responsible pet ownership. </p>
<p>We are working with a local Vet who is
advising us on how to provide the purr-fect environment for the cats. The Vet
will visit the cats at least monthly to check on the health and wellbeing of
the cats. We are also working with the local Pet Ambulance Service, who be
available to rush our cats to emergency treatment should ever the need arise
(Hopefully Never!)</p>
<p>We want to make the Capital Cat Café an
attraction and place Canberra is proud of! We want to support local business,
promote local products and give back to the community as much as we can. </p>
<p><br/></p><h3>FAQ's</h3><p>
</p><p><b>How much will it cost
to visit the cats?</b></p>
<p><i>A 1 hour visit with
cats will cost $12 once the Cat Cafe open. Pre-paying your visit via a ‘Cat
Play Date’ Perk will ensure you secure the exclusive price of $10 per 1 hour
visit.</i></p>
<p><b>Can I bring my own
cat?</b></p>
<p><i>Unfortunately no.
This could potentially be distressing for the Cat Café cats as well as your
cat.</i></p>
<p><b>Will the cats be
available for adoption?</b></p>
<p><i>No, the Café Cats
will be permanent residents of the Capital Cat Café . We will do
everything we can to support local rescue and animal welfare groups and will
promote and advertise cats available for adoption.  Having cats coming in
and out of a multi-cat environment can be unsettling and stressful for some
cats. In our experience, cats often take time to adapt to new environments so
we believe it to be in the best interests of the cats to have a secure, bonded
group.  The individual cats own personalities and needs are most important
to us and we want to provide a safe, secure, relaxed and happy environment for
our cats to live in. </i></p>
<p><b>I have heard other
Cat Cafe’s rotate cats in and out of the cat’s area so they don’t become too
tired or overwhelmed, will you be doing this?</b></p>
<p><i>No, the Capital Cat
Café  will be the cats own home. The cats will be able to come and go
whenever they please in and out of the rooms in the cat area. They will also
have access to their own special room away from visitors. Visitors will not be
allowed to disturb or wake a sleeping cat. Qualified staff will monitor the
cats and if needed remove a cat if it became distressed. (We will be rotating
the humans instead!)</i></p>
<p><b>Are you qualified to
care for the Cats?</b></p>
<p><i>We have been
completing specialist courses in feline behaviour and are undertaking further
studies in Animal Care. All staff will be trained in animal welfare and will
know our cats individually and be able to assess their needs. Furthermore our
Vet will attend the Cat Café at least monthly to check on the health and
welfare of the cats and we will continue to consult with them in regards to
welfare, behaviour and what is needed to provide the purr-fect kitty
wonderland.</i></p>
<p><b>Cats near food, isn’t
that unhygienic?</b></p>
<p><i>All food will be
prepared in an area away from the cats and staff handling food will not be near
the cats. The cats are will be separated from the Café by walls and glass
partitions. Visitors will be required to walk through an exclusion zone to
enter the cat’s area.  It will be the individual person’s choice if they
choose to take their food into the cat area.  Café staff will not serve
food in the cat area.</i></p>
<p><b>Will there be good
coffee?</b></p>
<p><i>YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!
The Capital Cat Café will have a full coffee shop with real coffee as well as
teas, hot chocolates and lots of other yummy things!</i></p>
<p><b>Will you have a cat
named Tony Abbott?</b></p>
<p><i>No not at this
stage... maybe once he retires.</i></p>
<p><b>Will you have jobs
available?</b></p>
<p><i>Yes! All jobs will be
advertised on our Facebook page in the first instance so please stay tuned to
that!</i></p>
<p><b>Are you looking for
corporate sponsorships?</b></p>
<p><i>Yes! Please contact
us via email.</i></p>
<p><b>Can I contribute via
direct bank transfer or check?</b></p>
<p><i>Yes, please contact
us to discuss via email or Facebook private message.</i></p>
<p><b>I can’t contribute
financially, but would still like to help. What can I do?</b></p>
<p><i>Please follow us on
social media, share this campaign and tell your friends and family about it.
The more people that hear about Capital Cat Café the better! </i></p>
<p><b>I have another
question, how can I ask you?</b></p>
<p><i>We are more than
happy to answer any questions. We can be contacted via Facebook, Twitter or
email. We will endeavour to respond to you as soon as possible, but we receive
many questions so please be patient. </i></p><p><br/></p><h3>Other ways you can contribute...</h3><h3></h3><p>

You will also get to interact with Australia’s first female Prime Minister, Ms
Julia Gillard... ok, so not the real Julia Gillard, but our Julia is also an
intelligent, ginger-haired leader! They will be joined by many other
Kitty-Parliamentarians who are putting litter-wars aside and are forming their
own government at the Capital Cat Café and want to take on Parliament House as
Canberra’s must-see tourist attraction!
The Capital Cat Café will be completely
unique to Canberra and like no other Cat Café in the world! The cafe will
be fitted out to reflect the Australian Nation’s Capital and Canberra’s many
tourist attractions. The Kitty-Parliamentarians will have their own Prime
Minister’s Office and Cabinet Room along with a mini Canberra decked out with
all the facilities and equipment a cat could ever want or need!Who are we?
We are two sisters, animal lovers and
now full time crazy cat ladies! We have both worked in the social welfare and
community sector for many years and are passionate about helping people and
animals! The idea of a starting a Cat Café came from seeing the happiness that
our own cat Zanda brought to people’s lives via his social
media. Our goal is to make the Capital Cat Café something that Canberra and
Australia are proud of. We have been working very hard all year to make the
Capital Cat Café a reality. It has not been an easy journey, but we are finally
getting there! 
What you get...
We are soooo thankful for your support
and for every single dollar contributed! We have a whole bunch of Perks we hope
you will take advantage of!
We think the best Perk is our “Wall
of Honour” Perk! Imagine your name and location fur-ever on the walls
of the café? That’s right the coffee shop part of the Capital Cat Café will be
covered forever with the names of the amazing people that supported us! We
would love to have people from all over Canberra, Australia and the rest of the
world! And we want you to be part of it!! 
Here's what it is going to look
something like...

We also have an exclusive offer
especially for our Crowdfunders! A Cat Play Date Perk gets you pre-paid entry
to visit the cats at a special discounted price! 
Cat welfare is our top priority!
The welfare of the café cats is of the
upmost important to us. All the cats will be rescued or rehomed cats that reside
permanently in the Cat Café.  We are working hard to find and personally
choose cats with the right temperaments and personalities to enjoy and actually
thrive in a Cat Café environment. It is important to us to know the cats
individually, their needs and their quirks, prior to the Cat Café opening and
to do this we are currently building the team of Capital Cat Café cats. Our
commitment to our cats is for their life and to be responsible pet owners to
each cat we will provide for them for the duration of their lives, even after
they may need to be retired from the Cat Café.
The cats will live in kitty-wonderland
created just for them.  The Capital Cat Café will be their home. The cats
will not be available for adoption, however we will be supporting local animal
welfare and rescue groups and doing everything we can to promote animal
adoptions and responsible pet ownership. 
We are working with a local Vet who is
advising us on how to provide the purr-fect environment for the cats. The Vet
will visit the cats at least monthly to check on the health and wellbeing of
the cats. We are also working with the local Pet Ambulance Service, who be
available to rush our cats to emergency treatment should ever the need arise
(Hopefully Never!)
We want to make the Capital Cat Café an
attraction and place Canberra is proud of! We want to support local business,
promote local products and give back to the community as much as we can. 
FAQ's
How much will it cost
to visit the cats?
A 1 hour visit with
cats will cost $12 once the Cat Cafe open. Pre-paying your visit via a ‘Cat
Play Date’ Perk will ensure you secure the exclusive price of $10 per 1 hour
visit.
Can I bring my own
cat?
Unfortunately no.
This could potentially be distressing for the Cat Café cats as well as your
cat.
Will the cats be
available for adoption?
No, the Café Cats
will be permanent residents of the Capital Cat Café . We will do
everything we can to support local rescue and animal welfare groups and will
promote and advertise cats available for adoption.  Having cats coming in
and out of a multi-cat environment can be unsettling and stressful for some
cats. In our experience, cats often take time to adapt to new environments so
we believe it to be in the best interests of the cats to have a secure, bonded
group.  The individual cats own personalities and needs are most important
to us and we want to provide a safe, secure, relaxed and happy environment for
our cats to live in. 
I have heard other
Cat Cafe’s rotate cats in and out of the cat’s area so they don’t become too
tired or overwhelmed, will you be doing this?
No, the Capital Cat
Café  will be the cats own home. The cats will be able to come and go
whenever they please in and out of the rooms in the cat area. They will also
have access to their own special room away from visitors. Visitors will not be
allowed to disturb or wake a sleeping cat. Qualified staff will monitor the
cats and if needed remove a cat if it became distressed. (We will be rotating
the humans instead!)
Are you qualified to
care for the Cats?
We have been
completing specialist courses in feline behaviour and are undertaking further
studies in Animal Care. All staff will be trained in animal welfare and will
know our cats individually and be able to assess their needs. Furthermore our
Vet will attend the Cat Café at least monthly to check on the health and
welfare of the cats and we will continue to consult with them in regards to
welfare, behaviour and what is needed to provide the purr-fect kitty
wonderland.
Cats near food, isn’t
that unhygienic?
All food will be
prepared in an area away from the cats and staff handling food will not be near
the cats. The cats are will be separated from the Café by walls and glass
partitions. Visitors will be required to walk through an exclusion zone to
enter the cat’s area.  It will be the individual person’s choice if they
choose to take their food into the cat area.  Café staff will not serve
food in the cat area.
Will there be good
coffee?
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!
The Capital Cat Café will have a full coffee shop with real coffee as well as
teas, hot chocolates and lots of other yummy things!
Will you have a cat
named Tony Abbott?
No not at this
stage... maybe once he retires.
Will you have jobs
available?
Yes! All jobs will be
advertised on our Facebook page in the first instance so please stay tuned to
that!
Are you looking for
corporate sponsorships?
Yes! Please contact
us via email.

direct bank transfer or check?

<p>We ( me and my family) realized that this game is perfect for every family that wants a relationship with the Bible. In that moment God sent us a great team: designers, producers, creatives, experts in marketing, logistic, and more.</p>

<br/>
</div></div>","Here is an idea of one of the seven categories.




This video shows another category, and a real testimony that usually happens in the game.














We all know there's a huge difference between an empty life and a life that has Jesus. Jesus is revealed to us in the Bible, a book inspired by God. (2 Tim 3:16) so when we are sharing time around the Bible, we are actually sharing many blessings that will change lives, because that's what he said on Isaiah 55:11, ""so is my word that goes out from my mouth: it will not return to me empty, but will accomplish what I desire, and achieve the purpose for which I sent it""



Reading the Bible is really fun and now with this game, it will be easier. In a really fun game every player will discover great verses that will let everybody know who Jesus really is.

</h3> <p>It all started when I wanted to build myself a tiny cabin on a tiny piece of land.  It appeared affordable; plus, I revelled in the simplicity of it and in the feeling of security it gave to me.  However, as I started to investigate how to go about making this idea a reality I was astonished at the restrictions I came across.  I was told the words ""you can't"" - more times than I liked.

Our research shows that the best use of money, energy and time is to hire professionals who do B2B marketing. We also need the time to create training for more staff and materials for larger organizations.
This is where your financial contributions will go:





Marketing – hire &
produce campaign. This is the expected cost to hire a B2B
marketer and afford the recommended campaign they design. Our research
indicates this will cost a minimum of $20,000.00 to get started with a B2B
marketing company. That includes branding and developing strategies of exactly
how we will represent With Respect, LLC and get the information in front of our
target audience.
Software & Tech
Upgrades. This is a correlated cost to the marketing costs. It
represents our anticipated cost for ensuring we have the necessary software and
technology to effectively create, utilize, and track our new marketing
experience.  
Program/Product
Development. It will require time and production costs for the
expanded program and product development. This is the paid wage for those
working as well as printing and producing of the forms, materials, and
consumables.
Indiegogo
Campaign Costs. These are the fees incurred through the programs and
credit card companies as well as the cost to develop and distribute the perks
items.
In addition to helping us reach out to organizations who want to support the growing movement towards respect and equity, you will receive our eternal gratitude! 
R.E.S.P.E.C.T.!
Find out what it means to me! 
And you can show how much it means to you too with our t-shirts, posters and bumper stickers that proclaim your support. 

       

Change the World
We all want to change the world, With Respect can give progressive organizations and companies the tools and skills to truly do just that.
Your contribution will allow us to reach out to organizations and collaboratively start building cultures of respect and equity that will positively impact not just the organizations themselves, but the communities they serve, having a global impact. 
Your contribution will literally help change the world!
   Risks & Challenges  If our program and services are not marketed well, we will not be able to reach the progressive companies that need and want our services. If we do not have the time to vet the program on larger organizations there is the possibility of missing important considerations. Those are the risks we run without the support of this campaign.
Regardless of whether we reach our campaign goal or not, we will continue to further our work, putting the monies we do receive towards a minimal marketing campaign and completing the training for new staff as we roll forward (building the plane while it's flying). This will limit our impact.
  Other Ways You Can Help Even if you can not contribute, or have already committed yourself elsewhere, and would still like to do something to support us , or even if you have already contributed here, 
please share our campaign, or the website or the Facebook page, or the linked-in page...
Talk about us, tell people what we are doing and help generate excitement in building respect into our culture!
And as always, you have our Gratitude for your support!",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Our story</h3>
<h3>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;font-size: 16px;"">If you like the idea of </span><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">less waste and more relove</span><span style=""font-weight: normal;font-size: 16px;"">, read on...</span>
</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>relove was created in 2013 by Suzanne Hickey &amp; Steve Anderson. After giving up our day jobs, our goal was to transform our true passions into a lifestyle business that followed our own ideas of what it means to live a life of bliss in a kinder, gentler world.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Passion for interior design and carpentry, mixed with our love of mid-century modern, vintage &amp; retro design led us to building a small business that creates one-of-a-kind upcycled items and handcrafted, custom designed furniture.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We are proud of our business and the impact we’ve made in rebuilding, upcycling, reusing and salvaging. By keeping items out of the landfill, by giving things a new life to be loved again, by building new pieces from old material that is usually wasted, we are positively contributing to our community, and in our own small way, to the state of the world. And, by using our creative talents in this way, we are also proud to offer our customers more sustainable &amp; beautiful design. </p>
<p>Be sure to check out the ""Gallery"" tab above to take a peek inside our workshop, a look behind the scenes, and  see a small selection of our finished items!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>What we need</h3>
<p>After upcycling, rebuilding and reloving <b>726 items </b>(and counting!) in our space, we are bursting at the seams with larger projects and bigger salvage trips.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>It’s time for us to grow! </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We want to bring you more relove. More upcycled pieces we’ve saved, more builds using reused/reclaimed/salvaged materials, more midcentury, vintage &amp; retro design. To do this, we need more space. More storage space and more cargo space.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Our goal is to DOUBLE the number of upcycled and rebuilt pieces we offer each year. </b>(Yup, that’s an average of almost 400 items/year!)  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>So, we are reaching out to our fantastic community -- family, friends, customers, supporters, allies, champions, cheerleaders, design junkies, the furniture-obsessed and relovers of all kinds -- who are both local and international (and all very near to our hearts!) to help us reach our goal.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Our crowdfunding campaign for <b>less waste, more relove</b> will help us continue to grow responsibly and support our financial stability so we’re around for a very long time.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Over the first three years, we’ve renovated our garage into a great workshop, turned our basement into a much-used studio and built an additional storage shed. We’ve put the proceeds of the recent sale of our Honda Fit into purchasing a larger vehicle. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>After three crazy, wonderful years of business, we’ve happily invested our love, time, creativity and energy into chasing our dreams and putting our passions out into the world in the form of relove. We are incredibly grateful every single day, in so many ways, to be able to do this and we are blown-away by what the universe brings back to us.</p>

We want to bring you more relove. More upcycled pieces we’ve saved, more builds using reused/reclaimed/salvaged materials, more midcentury, vintage & retro design. To do this, we need more space. More storage space and more cargo space.


Our goal is to DOUBLE the number of upcycled and rebuilt pieces we offer each year. (Yup, that’s an average of almost 400 items/year!)  




So, we are reaching out to our fantastic community -- family, friends, customers, supporters, allies, champions, cheerleaders, design junkies, the furniture-obsessed and relovers of all kinds -- who are both local and international (and all very near to our hearts!) to help us reach our goal.


Our crowdfunding campaign for less waste, more relove will help us continue to grow responsibly and support our financial stability so we’re around for a very long time.


Over the first three years, we’ve renovated our garage into a great workshop, turned our basement into a much-used studio and built an additional storage shed. We’ve put the proceeds of the recent sale of our Honda Fit into purchasing a larger vehicle. 


After three crazy, wonderful years of business, we’ve happily invested our love, time, creativity and energy into chasing our dreams and putting our passions out into the world in the form of relove. We are incredibly grateful every single day, in so many ways, to be able to do this and we are blown-away by what the universe brings back to us.

What people are saying

""[my husband] surprised me yesterday with the two side lamps that you repurposed. I was thrilled! We bought those lamps ten years ago. I am so pleased to be able to continue to use them. They look brand new and very “high end”. We both feel that we are so lucky to have such talent like Relove in our city."" -- C.H., Dartmouth, NS

""You know how sometimes at night when people have their lights on but haven't closed their blinds yet and you can ""accidentally"" see into their homes and check out their style?

Those people look really cool and modern and interesting."" -- E.S, Dartmouth, NS

For example, we will waste no food, use only eco or degradable friendly products and give all uneaten food to those in need. When you operate under a social project, you have held to a much higher standard than a regular business, so we will have not room for mistakes in our operations and culture as the slightest incident could put our brand at stake.

Donc, me soutenir dans le soutien de notre terre et les humains à travers le monde que j'ouvre le premier 100% écologique et convivial humanitaire et entreprise exploitée dans les petites villes et villages à travers le monde. # 1 Grenoble, France en 2017!In English: Why Green Canteen and Our Biggest Risk: As this is the first 100% eco and humanitarian friendly operated company and hopefully in the world -hopefully one day the first global chain- the biggest challenge we face is maintain our core values of operating 100% waste free, humanitarian focused, vegetarian and eco friendly. Many business will claim to be eco-friendly, but if you really look at all the operation practices, you will find less than eco-friendly says and short cuts. For example, we will waste no food, use only eco or degradable friendly products and give all uneaten food to those in need. When you operate under a social project, you have held to a much higher standard than a regular business, so we will have not room for mistakes in our operations and culture as the slightest incident could put our brand at stake. To mitigate this we will employ and partner with groups and individuals that have the same beliefs and monitor our operations daily.  So, support Green Canteen Today and support your world, humanity and building communities.En Français: Pourquoi vert Canteen et notre plus grand risque: Comme cela est la première 100% écologique et exploités par la compagnie amicale humanitaire et nous espérons que dans le monde -hopefully un jour le premier à chaîne mondiale le plus grand défi auquel nous sommes confrontés est de maintenir nos valeurs fondamentales de fonctionnement 100% sans déchets, humanitaire ciblée, végétarien et respectueux de l'environnement. Beaucoup d'affaires se prétendre être respectueux de l'environnement, mais si vous regardez vraiment toutes les pratiques de fonctionnement, vous trouverez moins respectueux de l'environnement dit et raccourcis. Par exemple, nous allons perdre aucune nourriture, utiliser uniquement éco ou dégradables produits écologiques et donner à tous les aliments non consommés à ceux dans le besoin. Lorsque vous faites fonctionner dans un projet social, vous avez tenu à un niveau beaucoup plus élevé qu'une entreprise régulière, donc nous aurons pas de place pour des erreurs dans nos opérations et de la culture que le moindre incident pourrait mettre notre marque en jeu. Pour atténuer cela, nous allons employer et en partenariat avec des groupes et des individus qui ont les mêmes croyances et surveillent quotidiennement nos opérations. Ainsi, le soutien vert Cantine Aujourd'hui et soutenir votre monde, l'humanité et la construction des communautés.In English: Who am I: I have been a humanitarian my whole life. I have provide shelter, food, clothes, money, friendship, employment, education and mentoring 1000s. Today, I am vegetarian, life 100% eco-friendly, 100% humanitarian friendly and activity contribute to my local community as much and as often as I can with my time, love and support (financial or emotional). I have an MBA, MS HR/ Organization Development, MS Education and have traveled to over 100 countries and know over 300 cultures. After traveling the world and seeing over 100 countries and returning home to New York, I felt inspired to do more and create a global green and humanitarian business that would help the environment, other do-gooders, support small businesses and promote community even in the smallest towns and cities around the world. I wanted also to add value to small cities and towns that are often looked over and not given the same service, product and experience value as big cities. Finally, I wanted to help the world reconnect with their sense of humanity and what it means to show human kindness. Green Canteen does that!En Français: Qui suis-je: Je suis un humanitaire toute ma vie. Je dois fournir un abri, de la nourriture, des vêtements, de l'argent, l'amitié, l'emploi, l'éducation et 1000s mentorat.

Je voulais aussi ajouter de la valeur aux petites villes et villages qui sont souvent regardé et pas donnés le même service, le produit et la valeur de l'expérience que les grandes villes. Enfin, je voulais aider le monde à renouer avec leur sens de l'humanité et ce que cela signifie pour montrer la bonté humaine.
