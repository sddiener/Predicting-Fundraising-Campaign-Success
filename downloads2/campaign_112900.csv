<p><em>Not Your Mother’s Playground: A realistic guide to honest, happy and healthy open relationships</em> (NYMP) is a book on modern open relationships aimed at a new generation, discussing everything from swinging to polyamory (multiple loves). It includes personal triumphs and challenges mixed in to give it a relatable, intimate feel. When my husband Steph and I looked to the stores to find material on the topic, the majority of the books we found were directed to an older, more “free-love” focused crowd.</p>
<p>The idea behind Not Your Mother’s Playground is to walk the reader through everything they will encounter should they choose to open up their relationship. It will show all sides from the good to the bad, not ignoring the reality that these relationships come with complications that can put even the strongest couples to the test.<br/><br/>NYMP is written from a first person point of view as I offer advice and guidance in a light-hearted, relatable and easy to understand tone. It’s important to me that readers feel as if they are engaged in a conversation while reading instead of having to understand self-help jargon. In addition to my advice and personal anecdotes, I will also include stories from other non-monogamous people and experts.<br/><br/>NYMP presents the steps readers need to take to succeed in their own open relationship in a way that’s not overwhelming for even relationship traditionalists to read.<br/><br/>Thank you so much from the ENTIRE cavern of my heart for your contributions to funding this project.

<h3>My Story</h3>
<div>My name is Patti Larsen. I'm a young adult paranormal author who gave up my day job to commit to a life of creativity and writing. This is the life I'm meant to live and I'm thrilled to be living it. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>When I sold my successful small business for this uncertain world of writing for a living I had no prospects, no sales, only a dream. I'm so fortunate to have the opportunity to devote my life to what I love--and I hope you'll help me do it.</div>

<div>The Hunted series tell the story of Reid, a sixteen-year-old boy kidnapped and dumped in the wilderness of the North Eastern United States. He quickly discovers he is part of an experiment--and he is not alone. Foster kids from across the country have been taken, used as training toys for mysterious hunters, part human, part animal. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>In the first novel, <i>Run</i>, Reid is forced to flee from the hunters, barely surviving long enough to meet and befriend other kids in the same position.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The second book, <i>Hide</i>, finds Reid and his friends deep underground in an abandoned mine, searching for a way past the hunters and to safety.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>For the final installment, <i>Fight</i>, Reid has had enough. He learns the terrible secret of the experiment and knows unless he and his friends can stop it, no one will.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>My plan is simple: raise enough money to hire an editor for the series, a cover designer and a format specialist for release as ebooks on Amazon.com, Barnes and Noble and through Createspace for hard copy.</div>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>I won't tell you if these books aren't published the world as we know it will collapse. Or that I have no other options. Of course I do. I am presently working with two small publishing houses on other projects. But I'm so sure this is the right way for me to go. I love trusting my instincts, and they are telling me to take this to you, the Indigogo family, and have you help me bring Reid's story to the reading public.</div>
</div><div><br/></div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>My goal is $2,500. That breaks down to $1,700 for professional editing, $150 for cover design, $150 for formatting and $500 for hard copy purchase of the first run ($165 toward buying hard copies per book).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I'll be moving ahead with this whether I reach my final goal or not, even if I'm required to tap into other (family) sources to do it. Planned release of Run is October 1st with Hide to follow November 1st and Fight just in time for the Christmas season on December 1st.</div>

You have more power than ever before, and so does everyone and everything else. Consider the following radical ideas that could soon reshape your life:



Going shopping may soon become obsolete -- along with closets, cabinets and freezers -- thanks to the rise of virtualization, collaborative consumption and just-in-time production

Your meals can be customized for optimal health as personal biomonitoring technologies start to speak with your kitchen

Making a living can take on new meaning as online currencies, fundraising platforms, at-home manufacturing, crowdsourced design, and DIY spaces open doors to rethinking your worklife

How you understand your place in the global ecosystem can shift radically as an estimated 22 billion nonhuman agents, such as bridges, bicycles and even oceans, join the two-billion-plus people online in the next decade.

I'm so passionate to share these timely ideas and, with your help,  I am self-publishing Massively Networked to get it in folks' hands early next year.  I would like your support to fund hardcover and digital (eBook, Kindle, online) versions. 

What's in it for you
By supporting the final production of Massively Networked, you will help unleash the potential for positive change by raising awareness of the practical power each of us holds to shape our future, individually and collectively. Contributions of any amount are greatly appreciated. By supporting the project with a contribution of $25 or more, you will get the following perks:



Contribute $25+ and you will be among the first to receive a hardcover copy of Massively Networked -- two weeks prior to its public release* (you can think of this as preordering the book)

$50+ to receive a signed copy two weeks prior to its public release, plus a contributor's mention in the book (optional if you would like to remain anonymous)

$75+ to receive a signed copy two weeks prior to public release, a founder's mention in the book, and a VIP invite to a special event in San Francisco. 



I must raise a minimum of $2000 by December 6, 2010 to kick off final production, so please make your contribution today. Early support is critical for giving the project greatest visibility on the IndieGoGo site.

*Shipping available only within the United States; shipping to international addresses may be possible for an additional shipping charge and will be handled on a case-by-case basis.

Other ways you can help
I appreciate your contribution today, and hope that you will share this message with your friends and colleagues on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and other sites using the links at the top of the page. Thank you in advance for your support!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>Cornelius Jones Jr. - &amp;Now Festival 2012: New Writing in PARIS!</h2>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><em>Cornelius Jones Jr.,</em></strong> actor-author-advocate-playwright-spoken word/performance artist.  Former cast member of Broadway's <em>The Lion King, </em>featured in MTV's LOGO PSA: ""I AM LIVING MY TRUTH,"" and author of the debut poetic memoir <em>Shadows &amp; Lights</em>.</p>
<p>I have been personally invited to read and perform <em>Shadows &amp; Lights</em> in an arts and cultural exchange festival called  <strong>“&amp;NOW 2012 New Writing in Paris,” June 6-10, 2012.  </strong></p>
<p>My aim is to encourage a cultural and inter-continental connection and/or dialogue to art as healing and social transformation by using theater and the literary art as a mean of self-expression and advocacy in hopes of educating communities and liberating people living with and/or affected by HIV/AIDS and other life altering illnesses. </p>
<p>I am asking for your support in any way possible. No donation is too small.  Even a donation of $10.00 gets me one step closer to my <strong>goal of $3,000.00</strong> to <strong>assist</strong> with transportation, accommodations, and food. If you are inspired and feeling generous in your donation, I am willing to offer anyone who donates<strong> $50 or more</strong> a <strong>complimentary and signed copy of “Shadows &amp; Lights.”</strong> For those who cannot financially support at this time, I have also begun a recycling fundraiser so if you are in the LA area please save your recyclable plastic and glass bottles/jugs and cans and contact me immediately (iamlifejones@gmail.com).  And if none of the options are possible, simply spreading the word is just as powerful!</p>
<p><strong>THE IMPACT:</strong><br/> Performing an intimate program of spoken word, movement, and song, through self-exposition and the theater genre of 1-man storytelling, I courageously share how it is to live and survive with HIV, as a gay-identified person, and as a performing artist. Through their live dance performances, plays, documentary films, and poetry: Essex Hemphill, Larry Kramer, and Bill T. Jones (to name a few), have inspired and actively motivated me to live beyond my circumstances.  The artists were at the beginning of an era with limited resources and education but broke the silence through their artistic acts of intervention.   The question is:  is this type of art relevant and important today and how are new artists approaching this topic through an artistic and activist lens in theater and literature? </p>
<p>The performance aim is a beacon of “Hope” in which we accept our circumstances and move on to become better for ourselves and for our community, regardless of where we may exist in the world.</p>
<p>The festival will take place at the world-renowned Université de la Sorbonne. It is one of the oldest Parisian universities, and the largest institution devoted to the humanities in France June 6-10, 2012.</p>
<p>Ultimately help get the word OUT, share the love and spread the message about my campaign and dont for get to use the Indiegogo share tools!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Trent. I'm an amatuer writer from Sydney, Australia. I currently work in the corporate world; but my true passion is writing.</p>
<p>Last month I started writing a full length novel. However, due to my work commitments; I have not been clear headed enough to spend much time on it.</p>
<p>I'm about to start a new life as a married man, and would like to begin this new life by chasing my passion.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I need</h3>
<p>Firstly, I need to be able to live for 6 months. As I have loans to pay and other expenses; the primary lump of funding will be my time.</p>
<p>I also need funding to self publish the first 200 copies of the book.</p>
<p>The target funding includes funding for the following:</p>
<p>* Editing<br/>* Proof reading<br/>* Self publication of my first 200 books<br/>* Living expenses while I write (and taxes paid etc)</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What's in it for you</h3>
<p>As a contributor, you are entitled to a number of perks (depending on your spend). All perks are cascading - therefore; you will get the perks of the lower perks plus the perk of your donation amount.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>If I don't hit the target</h3>
<p>If I don't make my target (+/- 30%) I will donate the money back to other indiegogo projects.</p>
<p>If I get within 30% of the target - I will continue with it (although I will be a struggling artist, haha).</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Why contribute?</h3>
<p>Not only will you be helping me chase my dream, you will also be contributing to the continuation of story telling. Without it, human existence would not be as rich and robust as it is.</p>
<p>Floating is a haunting, beautiful and confronting story that I believe will touch the mind and heart of everyone who reads it.</p>

I'm about to start a new life as a married man, and would like to begin this new life by chasing my passion.


What I need
Firstly, I need to be able to live for 6 months. As I have loans to pay and other expenses; the primary lump of funding will be my time.
I also need funding to self publish the first 200 copies of the book.
The target funding includes funding for the following:
* Editing* Proof reading* Self publication of my first 200 books* Living expenses while I write (and taxes paid etc)
 
What's in it for you
As a contributor, you are entitled to a number of perks (depending on your spend). All perks are cascading - therefore; you will get the perks of the lower perks plus the perk of your donation amount.
 


If I don't hit the target
If I don't make my target (+/- 30%) I will donate the money back to other indiegogo projects.
If I get within 30% of the target - I will continue with it (although I will be a struggling artist, haha).
 
Why contribute?
Not only will you be helping me chase my dream, you will also be contributing to the continuation of story telling. Without it, human existence would not be as rich and robust as it is.
Floating is a haunting, beautiful and confronting story that I believe will touch the mind and heart of everyone who reads it.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I, a journalist with 25 years of experience, have been with one of the most important groups shaping developments in the Middle-East for a whole year. I wrote the book - in Dutch. A professional translator is working on translating two chapters of it to English. With these two chapters, I can try to get an English publisher. I can't finance this myself, since I have been working on the book for some 18 months now and I'm basically broke. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I just need to pay the translator properly. Since I work as a freelance journalist, I know that getting paid properly is getting harder and harder. So no way I will underpay the translator myself. What you will get? Eventually: the English version of my book. It will be the first independent journalistic book based on long term on the ground research with the Kurdish troops in Kurdistan.

</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>I look at my writing career as a combination of continuing education and entrepreneurial business. Until I have a book published, I have no product to sell. To the best of my ability, I balance offering my writing skills to clients with building my writer's platform. I chose to build a platform and community together because I recognize the need for writers to have both a synergistic presence and a place to practice and process craft. <br/></p>
<p>""Miracle of Ducks"" is the first of many fictional stories I have to tell that cultivates a strong voice for women.  I'm already working on my third novel and I produce one flash fiction story per week. My freelancing portfolio of writing spans over twenty years of published articles. I'm a reliable writer; my next step is to emerge with a successfully published novel.</p>
<p>My former career in marketing communications prepares me for the strategic aspects of attending a symposium such as this. I know how to network, overcome shyness in crowds and promote my brand as a writer. This opportunity will have a turning-point impact on my career. And I hope to make an impact in the world as a woman writer who believes in the diverse voices and stories of women.<br/></p> <ul></ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> My biggest challenge as a writer is financial. I took a big risk to pursue writing ""Miracle of Ducks,"" but I decided to use my skills and resourcefulness when I had a major life set-back. It has not been easy, but every day I joyfully embrace getting to write. <br/></p>
<p>I also chose to return to my remote western roots and live in a rural region of northern Idaho. It's an important element of my voice which reflects rural and western women. Going to LA alone is a big deal for me because I also have diagnosed PTSD. I've traveled for business many times before so I know how to handle my anxiety-level and trigger points. Mostly, I'm willing and able. Like an entrepreneur, I see these as calculated risks worth taking. <br/></p>
<p>My plan all along has been to continue learning on my own (rather than to pursue an MFA). I have Bachelor of Arts degree in writing and have invested in many books and resources over the years. I attended numerous writing workshops to get ""Miracle of Ducks"" to where it is, including a five day book development course that was offered where my book is set.</p>
<p>I've already mapped out my trip and reserved a safe place to lodge that is within walking distance of the conference. I've reserved the shuttle service to get me to and fro the airport. I feel that I'm prepared logistically, as well as strategically and professionally. <br/></p> <ul></ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Read and offer feedback or encouragement. My greatest contributors are often on a lean bean diet like me, but take time to share an uplifting word or read my writing.<br/></p> <ul> <li>Spread the word to appropriate people -- patrons of the writing arts.<br/>
</li> <li>Like the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/CarrotRanchCommunications"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Carrot Ranch Flash Fiction</a> page on Facebook.</li>

I also chose to return to my remote western roots and live in a rural region of northern Idaho. It's an important element of my voice which reflects rural and western women. Going to LA alone is a big deal for me because I also have diagnosed PTSD. I've traveled for business many times before so I know how to handle my anxiety-level and trigger points. Mostly, I'm willing and able. Like an entrepreneur, I see these as calculated risks worth taking. 
My plan all along has been to continue learning on my own (rather than to pursue an MFA). I have Bachelor of Arts degree in writing and have invested in many books and resources over the years. I attended numerous writing workshops to get ""Miracle of Ducks"" to where it is, including a five day book development course that was offered where my book is set.
I've already mapped out my trip and reserved a safe place to lodge that is within walking distance of the conference. I've reserved the shuttle service to get me to and fro the airport. I feel that I'm prepared logistically, as well as strategically and professionally.     Other Ways You Can Help Read and offer feedback or encouragement. My greatest contributors are often on a lean bean diet like me, but take time to share an uplifting word or read my writing.  Spread the word to appropriate people -- patrons of the writing arts.

Why RobotiCS?

Programmer Matias Katingen - the main character
It was my dream to master a storyline since I was a teenager. One of my most favourite books is R.U.R. written by Czech famous novelist Karel Capek, the co-inventor of the word ROBOT.
""Just look around there are robotic vacuum cleaners, unmanned aerial vehicles, industrial robots,  smart TVs, preprogrammed cars, etc. We are living in such world and the dependance on technology separate us one from each other emotionally. I wrote a story about near future to draw attention to this problem.""
Origin of the book

During first 3 months a simple version of the book has been created. But my book was full of weedy words >:(. To get rid of them together with some short modifications took me another 3 months. But even though I was not satisfied (I am not even now anyway :D).

Meanwhile I implemented changes suggested by my close friends and relatives. Because I was a full-time employee it took ages. I finished the book at the end of the year 2014.

I wrote this book because I wanted to illuminate a part of United States judicial system often viewed only through the lens of its opinions - the Supreme Court. Further, I wanted to portray the Court through the eyes of its law clerks, a much different perspective from how it is traditionally viewed.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that the Supreme Court is not as strictly one-dimensional as it appears to the public, but warm and collegiate, while always aiming to find the right answer to the country’s greatest legal questions. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for studying the Supreme Court in you. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you look at the future of constitutional law in a new light, taking from the lessons and advice of former Supreme Court law clerks to understand their justices’ long-term impact in an area that has nothing to do with the landmark opinions they deliver.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about the Supreme Court law clerks' role, and the crucial mentorship their beloved justices provide.</p><p> </p><ul>
<li>the clerks’ important, yet too often overlooked responsibilities</li>
<li>inspiring stories of the working relationship that develops between clerks and their justices</li>
<li>career advice and insight about the future of constitutional law from former clerks</li>
</ul><p> </p><p>You will love this book if you are interested in politics, law, and, of course, the United States Supreme Court! <i>Beside the Nine</i> speaks to young adults and professionals who are looking to learn more about our nation’s highest court. This book offers a different view of the American judicial system by looking through the lens of those who are a crucial part of its function, but also out of the spotlight.</p><p> </p><h2>The Book - <i>Beside the Nine</i>
</h2><p><br/>The book is written in 3 Parts....<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the introduction and Chapters 1-5. In the introduction, I describe who young Supreme Court clerks are, and why their role becomes so significant as they pass through later stages of their career. I discuss their position at the Court and detail their workload, from sifting through petitions of <i>certiorari</i> to drafting final opinions. Each part of the processes and protocol surrounding a case on the Supreme Court’s docket will be explained comprehensively.<br/><br/>Part 2 contains Chapters 5-8. Through stories and anecdotes, this section discusses the special relationship between clerks and their justices, and what makes it so special, whether that means playing basketball with Justice Clarence Thomas at the “highest court in the land” (there is actually a basketball court located directly above the courtroom in the Supreme Court building!), whitewater rafting with the adventuresome ""FWOTSC"" (first woman of the Supreme Court, as Justice Sandra Day O'Connor proudly referred to herself), and sweet love stories that develop between co-clerks (while their justices enthusiastically play matchmaker).<br/><br/>Part 3 contains Chapters 9-10. Based on interviews I’ve conducted with former Supreme Court clerks, I discuss how Supreme Court clerks are shaping the future of constitutional law - even long after they finish their clerkship. In addition, clerks share their own advice for those thinking about entering the legal field, as well as discuss what qualities they believe are integral to the fabric of a successful constitutional lawyer.<br/> </p><h2>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h2><p><br/>This book will be published with New Degree Press.

I wrote this book because I wanted to illuminate a part of United States judicial system often viewed only through the lens of its opinions - the Supreme Court. Further, I wanted to portray the Court through the eyes of its law clerks, a much different perspective from how it is traditionally viewed.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that the Supreme Court is not as strictly one-dimensional as it appears to the public, but warm and collegiate, while always aiming to find the right answer to the country’s greatest legal questions. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for studying the Supreme Court in you. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you look at the future of constitutional law in a new light, taking from the lessons and advice of former Supreme Court law clerks to understand their justices’ long-term impact in an area that has nothing to do with the landmark opinions they deliver.In this book, you'll learn about the Supreme Court law clerks' role, and the crucial mentorship their beloved justices provide. 
the clerks’ important, yet too often overlooked responsibilities
inspiring stories of the working relationship that develops between clerks and their justices
career advice and insight about the future of constitutional law from former clerks
 You will love this book if you are interested in politics, law, and, of course, the United States Supreme Court! Beside the Nine speaks to young adults and professionals who are looking to learn more about our nation’s highest court. This book offers a different view of the American judicial system by looking through the lens of those who are a crucial part of its function, but also out of the spotlight. The Book - Beside the Nine
The book is written in 3 Parts....Part 1 contains the introduction and Chapters 1-5. In the introduction, I describe who young Supreme Court clerks are, and why their role becomes so significant as they pass through later stages of their career. I discuss their position at the Court and detail their workload, from sifting through petitions of certiorari to drafting final opinions. Each part of the processes and protocol surrounding a case on the Supreme Court’s docket will be explained comprehensively.Part 2 contains Chapters 5-8. Through stories and anecdotes, this section discusses the special relationship between clerks and their justices, and what makes it so special, whether that means playing basketball with Justice Clarence Thomas at the “highest court in the land” (there is actually a basketball court located directly above the courtroom in the Supreme Court building!), whitewater rafting with the adventuresome ""FWOTSC"" (first woman of the Supreme Court, as Justice Sandra Day O'Connor proudly referred to herself), and sweet love stories that develop between co-clerks (while their justices enthusiastically play matchmaker).Part 3 contains Chapters 9-10. Based on interviews I’ve conducted with former Supreme Court clerks, I discuss how Supreme Court clerks are shaping the future of constitutional law - even long after they finish their clerkship. In addition, clerks share their own advice for those thinking about entering the legal field, as well as discuss what qualities they believe are integral to the fabric of a successful constitutional lawyer. What I Need & What You'll GetThis book will be published with New Degree Press.

<h2><strong>The Story of My Book</strong></h2>
<p>My name is Claire Navaro Krawsczyn and I am the author of <i>Expectant Entrepreneur</i>. This book started as a simple idea: to document my experience as a woman who was simultaneously growing my family and my business. Today, <i>Expectant Entrepreneur</i> is so much more than that. It captures the stories of women across the world who experience the challenges, thrills, hardships, loneliness, and victories of what it means to be a mother and a business owner--and the unique characteristics of women who choose to be both at the same time. <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that there is an enormous and welcoming community of women in the world who deeply understand what it means to be an <i>Expectant Entrepreneur</i>. Through this book, I hope to share the stories and triumphs of other women who have decided that they can be successful business owners <i>and </i>amazing mothers. And, ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you confidently plan your own maternity leave within your business.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about how the women who came before us created a world in which women can be both mothers and business owners and the unique characteristics of mother-business owners:</p>
<ul>

<li>Hallmark Characteristics and Shared Stories</li>

</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you are, or you support, a bold woman who isn't afraid to be both a mother and entrepreneur.<br/><br/><i>Expectant Entrepreneur</i> is a non-fiction book that speaks to mothers and entrepreneurs who are looking at expanding their businesses while also growing their families for the first--or fifth--time.</p>

<p> </p>
<h2>The Book - Expectant Entrepreneur</h2>
<br/>The book is written in four parts....<br/><br/><strong>Part 1 </strong>contains the introduction + and Chapters 1-4. In this section, called “How We Got Here,” we outline the path of women through modern history that created the opportunity for today’s Expectant Entrepreneurs. Part 1 opens up the cultural significance of entrepreneurism within the context of feminism, independence, and motherhood.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains Chapters 5-15. Throughout this section of the book, “What It Means to be an Expectant Entrepreneur,” we hear from dozens of women across the world who share their own stories of motherhood and entrepreneurism. Through their experiences, we explore some of the hallmark characteristics that these women share in an effort to explore what it means to be an Expectant Entrepreneur. Chapters 5 sets us up to understand the context of Chapters 6-15, each of which explores a single characteristic that unites business-owning mothers across cultures and countries.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> contains Chapters 16-19, which reflects my own personal journey as an Expectant Entrepreneur. I had both of my daughters, now 4 years old and 7 months old, while also growing my business into a sustainable, stable six-figure company. Preparing for my own maternity leave was a challenge, and through voice memos, notes, journal entries, and more, I documented my journey in an effort to share my experiences with other women.<br/><br/><strong>Part 4</strong> is the Fourth Trimester, or, the conclusion of Expectant Entrepreneur that encourages women to connect and build a community around our individual perspectives of our shared experience.<br/> <h2>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h2>

<h3>Intro and Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Naomi Nowak and I'm an artist. I've been making a living from my creativity full time since 2012, painting, illustrating, designing an eco-friendly clothing line and making jewellery. More on that on my<a href=""http://shop.naomi.se"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> website</a> and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/naominowak/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">instagram</a> ♥<br/><br/>Social media has been a blessing in my life - from the early days of LiveJournal, through Tumblr and Instagram. They no longer function in the same way though which has made things a lot more difficult for me and my colleagues. It's unnecessary, and that's what brings me here.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542217302/sqrgo1u15s9sasbo8u7z.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><i>(a realistically messy view of me at work. i love what i do)</i></p>
<p><strong>Here's a super brief explanation of what's going on. Skip this paragraph if you already know :) </strong>Up until a few years ago social media feeds were chronological. You chose who you follow and their posts showed up in your feed according to the time posted. Simple, democratic. This changed and now artificial intelligence decides what you see in your feed and in what order. Pages or people you have chosen to follow may not show up at all, others may show up disproportionately often. The corporations running social media say this is to ""optimise your experience"" and ""show you the best content"". In fact, it's to manipulate you to spend more time online and click more ads (see links below). It's been devastating for art, activism and small business which is why I'm creating this zine.<br/><br/>In addition to making art and fashion i'm also an activist and my work has everything to do with non-consumerism, the environment and human rights (<a href=""https://shop.naomi.se/pages/about"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">more here</a>). <strong>Confession:</strong> I really have no interest in grappling with issues of “tech” and “media”. But the problem is that centralised and opaque corporations now have a near monopoly on our means of communication and are actively hindering my work, and that of many others, through artifical intelligence manipulation. So I either grapple with this issue or cop out. This zine is my way of tackling it and it is my hope and belief that others can be helped by it as well ♥<br/><br/>The ""Social Media Survival Guide"" builds on research into how social media algorithma impact artists, makers, small business and activists. I've outlined coping strategies for protecting mental health. And ways that I think we can change things. </p>
<p>The zine also touches on the bigger implications: this effects our political climate, the ways in which we consume and interact and can literally be a matter of life and death.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542217407/qcqgxbj7obf1wdn379nd.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><br/>I've created seven original illustrations for this (scroll down to see them!). They are inspired by the seven pointed star - faery star - a symbol I've used much in my work as an artist.

<p>We as humans are facing huge challenges at the moment with climate change and a rise of fascism in many corners of the world.

It's my personal belief that a little bit of magical thinking goes a long way, which is why I've included drawings with magical intent. If that's not your cup of tea maybe you'll find them pretty at least ;) </p>
<p>I've used my own experiences to inform the texts, but also spoken to many of my peers and read books and articles on the matter in an effort to distill something useful for those of us who have decided to stick it out in a sticky climate.<br/><br/>If, like me, you think this issue is important please consider supporting the project by becoming a backer or spreading the word ♥</p>
<h3>On how pre-orders work</h3>
<p><br/>Funds raised from pre-orders will go to the following:<br/><br/>- <strong>Printing costs</strong> - This is ofcourse the main expense, and not one that I can afford out of pocket. I want to support a small printing business and keep this as eco-friendly as possible, which is costlier than international print-on-demand services.<br/>- <strong>Time</strong> - As this campaign launches the illustrations are completed and the text is ready in draft form. Editing, layout and pre-print prep still needs work and it's time consuming. I've already taken a lot of time off my regular work (painting, sewing, illustration, jewellery) in order to do this and it's gonna take a bit more.</p>
<p>So this is very straight forward - what's on offer is the zine itself - 20 pages of text and pencil illustrations - and you can get yours in a few different ways :) I've even included a limited amount at a reduced price for fellow artists who might be struggling financially. I'll up this number if the goal is reached. <br/><br/>The original elemental illustrations are also available to help fund printing costs and hopefully find good homes.<br/><br/><strong>If the pre-order goal isn't met you will be fully refunded</strong> and this project will not take shape in printed form. Print is important to me because of the nature of the subject - it deals with how intangible, highly secretive formulas shape our online world. I would really love for this information to be on paper, in your hands, to look at when you're offline :) That's also how protection works - I created the illustrations with specific intent to be soft in a harsh climate. I will continue to write about this on my blog and keep posting videos on the subject regardless if it goes to print or not ♥</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why is this important and what's in it? (aka the slightly longer story &amp; deets)</h3>
<p><br/>What really stands out for me when I speak to artists and small business owners about this is the mental health and emotional aspect. This development has unnecessarily messed with our livelihood in order to favour... What, exactly? Ad revenue, corporations, yes. But those things existed before the changes and were making plenty of money then, too ... So it must be more complex than that. This goes deep and cannot be easily reversed, but I believe awareness is always the first step towards change.<br/><br/>Artificial Intelligence is a complicated issue that's often difficult to discuss and make sense of, especially as it's constantly changing. We know that AI has little understanding for slower values and deeper meaning - what it cares about is clicks and optimisation and this tendency is spinning our world into darker places day by day by exploiting our lowest common denominators. My dream is to provide an easily accessible foundation to discuss and build strategy around this challenge.<br/><br/>It's also an attempt to heal my own wounds arounds this. At this point I would actually love to just get off social media, but I can't because it's my livelihood. Like many others, I didn't see this shift coming so I spent years of my life building an audience online for my soul's work - which is painting and drawing  - and managed to create a large following on several networks.  A few years ago this was effectively taken away from me (and many others) for very obscure reasons. Many of us are making a living with the scraps that are left. There's a lot of secrecy and doublespeak going on from corporations around this, which I'll go into in the zine.<br/><br/>I'm personally very grateful for the kind and wonderful people who support my art and appreciated my work throughout the years ♥♥♥ I'm saying that to make sure these efforts aren't misconstrued as 'negativity'. For me this is the opposite, a very hopeful venture, wanting to make a small difference for some of my peers and then maybe good vibes and kindness will snowball from that. As Above, So Below.<br/><br/>This issue bubbles up in conversation everywhere. On instagram, facebook, twitter ... But I've experienced a lot of fear in talking about it, because the system may punish those who speak out (by limiting their so called ""reach"" and oftentimes, thereby, their livelihood). <br/><br/>Now, some details!</p>
<p><strong>Zine specs: </strong><br/><br/>- A minimum of 20 pages (this may go up as i edit the text)<br/>- 7 full page illustrations<br/>- Printed on eco friendly paper, using eco friendly inks and supporting small printing business.<br/>- A5 (half letter) size<br/><br/><strong>Zine contents:</strong><br/><br/>- An introduction containing a brief explanation of what has changed on social media, my personal reasons for creating this work and a bit of my life as a full time creative. <br/>- A main section with 10 guidelines for navigating social media and supporting one another in this climate. From self-care to supporting colleagues to building strategy for change.<br/>- Four mini essays: On mental health, on the rise of fear and fascism + outrage culture, on consumerism and climate change, on spiritual protection and building community.<br/>- Some hopes and ideas for the future.<br/>- A dictionary explaining the newspeak words used by corporations to make us believe these changes are for our own good.</p>
<p>I should perhaps add a disclaimer here: I'm not here to ""help you get followers"". There are plenty of people who say they can do that. They very probably can't and the reasons for that will be outlined in the booklet. <br/><br/> </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I'm well aware that it's not possible for everyone to pitch in. If you believe in this project though - sharing it is hugely appreciated and extremely helpful!<br/>You can share on social media of course (please do!), but email, direct messages and word of mouth are just as valuable ♥♥♥</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I haven't made a zine for many years now, but I've made plenty of comics and illustrated booklets in my day. Some self published, some with a publisher. <br/><br/>I'm also experienced when it comes to shipping orders and getting things done as I've been running my web shop (on etsy and on my own sites) since 2012. I have customers all over the world, some of whom are undoubtedly reading this, hi!!<br/><br/>So I'd say I'm qualified to get this off the ground, into print and into your hands! It should ship in December if all goes to my plan, but I put January just to be safe.<br/><br/>For full disclosure and transparency, here are the possible challenges: <br/><br/>- The holiday season. I sometimes get more orders than usual around the holidays and shipping orders is time/energy consuming. I think I've calculated so that I'll have time to finish this up for print in time to ship it in December. Absolute worst case scenario it will go out late January. This also depends on the printers, as they can be busy around this time of year as well.<br/><br/>- Health issues. I've struggled a little bit with my health this year, which isn't something I'm used to! It's nothing serious and I'm doing very well for the most part I just have days where I can't get much done. If too many of those happen in Nov/Dec the print prep will be delayed somewhat and orders will go out in January, rather than in December which is my goal.<br/><br/>I'm well prepared though, and most of this work is finished :) It's always best to add, just like I do in web shops: Please remember that this is a one woman show, and your kind patience is much appreciated should things get delayed.<br/> </p>

My name is Naomi Nowak and I'm an artist. I've been making a living from my creativity full time since 2012, painting, illustrating, designing an eco-friendly clothing line and making jewellery. More on that on my website and instagram ♥Social media has been a blessing in my life - from the early days of LiveJournal, through Tumblr and Instagram. They no longer function in the same way though which has made things a lot more difficult for me and my colleagues. It's unnecessary, and that's what brings me here.(a realistically messy view of me at work. i love what i do)
Here's a super brief explanation of what's going on. Skip this paragraph if you already know :) Up until a few years ago social media feeds were chronological. You chose who you follow and their posts showed up in your feed according to the time posted. Simple, democratic. This changed and now artificial intelligence decides what you see in your feed and in what order. Pages or people you have chosen to follow may not show up at all, others may show up disproportionately often. The corporations running social media say this is to ""optimise your experience"" and ""show you the best content"". In fact, it's to manipulate you to spend more time online and click more ads (see links below). It's been devastating for art, activism and small business which is why I'm creating this zine.In addition to making art and fashion i'm also an activist and my work has everything to do with non-consumerism, the environment and human rights (more here). Confession: I really have no interest in grappling with issues of “tech” and “media”. But the problem is that centralised and opaque corporations now have a near monopoly on our means of communication and are actively hindering my work, and that of many others, through artifical intelligence manipulation. So I either grapple with this issue or cop out. This zine is my way of tackling it and it is my hope and belief that others can be helped by it as well ♥The ""Social Media Survival Guide"" builds on research into how social media algorithma impact artists, makers, small business and activists. I've outlined coping strategies for protecting mental health. And ways that I think we can change things. 
The zine also touches on the bigger implications: this effects our political climate, the ways in which we consume and interact and can literally be a matter of life and death.I've created seven original illustrations for this (scroll down to see them!). They are inspired by the seven pointed star - faery star - a symbol I've used much in my work as an artist. Each illustration represents an element - Earth, Air, Fire and Water but also Above, Below and Within. The originals are also up for grabs here to help fund the zine.
We as humans are facing huge challenges at the moment with climate change and a rise of fascism in many corners of the world. I believe in change but it's being hindered by the fact that the way we relate and communicate - very often through social media - is now skewed. This is a dangerous development and a daunting thing to think about. Remembering the old adage ""As Above so Below"" always helps me when I feel overpowered and hopeless. It's my personal belief that a little bit of magical thinking goes a long way, which is why I've included drawings with magical intent. If that's not your cup of tea maybe you'll find them pretty at least ;) 
I've used my own experiences to inform the texts, but also spoken to many of my peers and read books and articles on the matter in an effort to distill something useful for those of us who have decided to stick it out in a sticky climate.If, like me, you think this issue is important please consider supporting the project by becoming a backer or spreading the word ♥

<h2>Grow Street Smart Awareness and Inquiry-In-Action with Us</h2>
<p>We are facing a world of complexity and uncertainty. People in organisations acknowledge the need for developing new sets of capacities and new ways of organising to face this challenge. There are numerous models, frameworks and examples for getting started, and yet current research shows that whilst these are well known there is a problem putting them into action.</p>
<p>We, <a href=""http://amara.fi/who-we-are/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jane Allen, Heidi Gutekunst and Bill Torbert</a>, work with the integrated perspectives for transforming individuals, teams and organisations. As a team combined we have more than 80 years of experience of working with transformations, as facilitator, CEO, organisational consultant, coach and professor in leadership. The core of our work is, <a href=""https://hbr.org/2005/04/seven-transformations-of-leadership"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Action Inquiry</a>, the life work of <a href=""http://www.williamrtorbert.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bill Torbert</a>, which is statistically confirmed as reliably generating both personal and organisational transformation. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The models, theories and frameworks are in place – where is the action?</h3>
<p>For pragmatists there often is a gap between the theories and the applying them in organisational life. Practices done in offsite education programmes and retreats are seldom directly applicable in the chaotic workday, where we need to be more ‘street smart’ while bringing in awareness and inquiry-in-action.</p>
<p><strong><i> This gap, of translating the practices of transformation to become more street smart, is calling for attention!</i></strong></p>
<p>We have developed a set of Street Smart awareness and inquiry-in-action -practices and are in the process of developing and gathering more. It is our contribution to the world, in a time when it is most needed. We are doing it in form of writing a book with an online extension - an online learning platform. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Is it only for organisational leaders?</h3>
<p>Street Smart Awareness and Inquiry-In-Action is for people who feel a call for personal and organisational development, and who benefit from practical ways of applying practices of transformation in the midst of chaotic, uncertain and complex environments.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>Have you ever been on a workshop, become inspired to apply the learning and then when you get back to work and daily life the good intentions go out of the window? </i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>Do you ever struggle to get your brain and body connected?</i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>Have you ever been in a crisis, where your (trained) mind tells you left and your gut feeling right?</i></p>
<p>It is also for people working with the leaders of the future. Our children. The way we teach our children in school (and parent our children) is in need of transformation and often lack the resources, and therefore we want to offer support to this group.    </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Together we can create much more awareness-in-action</h2>
<p><strong><i>We believe in the power of small actions and their ripple effect.</i></strong></p>
<p>Together we can create an even more aware world with closer connections, more loving interactions and more engaging workplaces by taking the baby steps in transforming ourselves, our organisations and our schools by developing more mature and healthy leadership.</p>
<p><strong><i>Come along and join this adventure by: </i></strong></p>
<p><strong>Buying</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the book in advance, as a printed or digital version</li>
<li>the book plus a 3 month online programme</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Inviting</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>a group of friends to buy the book and the online programme</li>
<li>your work team to buy the book plus the online programme</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Giving the book as a gift</strong></p>
<ul><li>to someone you know</li></ul>
<p><strong>Spreading the word about this campaign in your network</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We need funding is for making the book useful and inspirational, by enriching the content with inspiring illustrations, hiring both a professional text editor and a professional video artist. We will need 12000 € for an illustrator, 4000 € for text editing, 8000 € for video production and 6000 € for producing the perks. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>“It all looks impossible until it is done”</h3>
<p>The timeline is tight, we have set to write this book over the summer 2017. In no way is it impossible - we have done ""the impossible"" before"". In 2015 we set up a commercial, branded, international conference in Helsinki for over 100 organisational leaders: <i><a href=""http://integralleadershipreview.com/14116-1130-the-amara-adventure-bringing-transformation-to-life-in-organizations/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bringing Transformations to Life in Organisations</a>. </i>A then unknown topic and now 2 years later has become a hot topic in Finland.  </p>
<p>It needs determination and a healthy load of discipline, to make it tangible. We trust our passion and love for making this happen by creating magic in this process. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank you for considering to support this dream to come alive!  We feel grateful for every possible contribution, whether it is funding this project or simply spreading the world! </p>
<p>Come along - join the fun and contribute to a world of more Street Smart Aware leaders of today and tomorrow - that includes us all!</p>

We have developed a set of Street Smart awareness and inquiry-in-action -practices and are in the process of developing and gathering more. It is our contribution to the world, in a time when it is most needed. We are doing it in form of writing a book with an online extension - an online learning platform. 
 
Is it only for organisational leaders?
Street Smart Awareness and Inquiry-In-Action is for people who feel a call for personal and organisational development, and who benefit from practical ways of applying practices of transformation in the midst of chaotic, uncertain and complex environments.
Have you ever been on a workshop, become inspired to apply the learning and then when you get back to work and daily life the good intentions go out of the window? 
Do you ever struggle to get your brain and body connected?
Have you ever been in a crisis, where your (trained) mind tells you left and your gut feeling right?
It is also for people working with the leaders of the future. Our children. The way we teach our children in school (and parent our children) is in need of transformation and often lack the resources, and therefore we want to offer support to this group.    
 
Together we can create much more awareness-in-action
We believe in the power of small actions and their ripple effect.
Together we can create an even more aware world with closer connections, more loving interactions and more engaging workplaces by taking the baby steps in transforming ourselves, our organisations and our schools by developing more mature and healthy leadership.

We will need 12000 € for an illustrator, 4000 € for text editing, 8000 € for video production and 6000 € for producing the perks. 
 

“It all looks impossible until it is done”
The timeline is tight, we have set to write this book over the summer 2017. In no way is it impossible - we have done ""the impossible"" before"". In 2015 we set up a commercial, branded, international conference in Helsinki for over 100 organisational leaders: Bringing Transformations to Life in Organisations. A then unknown topic and now 2 years later has become a hot topic in Finland.  
It needs determination and a healthy load of discipline, to make it tangible. We trust our passion and love for making this happen by creating magic in this process. 
 
Thank you for considering to support this dream to come alive!  We feel grateful for every possible contribution, whether it is funding this project or simply spreading the world! 
Come along - join the fun and contribute to a world of more Street Smart Aware leaders of today and tomorrow - that includes us all!
 /heidiOn behalf of the authors: Jane and Heidi, in collaboration with BillCover designed by Serenity in Chaos Art.  About Amara CollaborationWe set up the social enterprise, Amara Collaboration, with a vision to double the worldwide number of leaders with capacity for awareness-in-action and the exercise of mutually-transforming power. We believe that aware leadership will contribute to a more conscious world with aware organisations, effective leaders, sustainable decisions, engaged employees and more loving relationships.  In the spirit of being a social enterprise we contribute 60% of our profit to the purpose of Amara. Last year we made it possible for two lovely, active individuals working hard to transform the school system and leadership in Ukraine to attend a certification training, so that they can bring it into their local work.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

The news was confirmed by Maroon during a legal call with an attorney from the <a href=""http://abolitionistlawcenter.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Abolitionist Law Center</a>.</p><p>Abolitionist Law Center Executive Director, Bret Grote, said, ""My talk 
with Maroon today was very moving. There are no words to adequately 
convey the significance of his release to the general population for him
 and his family. This is a significant victory for a growing people's 
movement against solitary confinement and the human rights violations 
inherent in mass incarceration. If we continue to work hard and support 
one another in this movement, these victories could very well become a 
habit.""<br/></p><p>Maroon's son, Russell Shoatz III, said, ""We are very excited that this day has finally come. My father being released from solitary confinement is proof of the power of people organizing against injustice, and the importance of building strong coalitions. I especially want to thank all of those who have supported the collective struggle to end my father's solitary confinement, including my siblings and members of the Shoatz family, the Human Rights Coalition, Abolitionist Law Center, Scientific Soul Sessions, the entire legal team, UN Special Rapporteur Juan Mendez, the 5 Nobel Peace Laureates, the National Lawyers Guild, Center for Constitutional Rights, along with the dozens of other organizations and thousands of individuals who have participated in this effort.""</p><p><br/></p><h3>What's Next?</h3><p>The litigation on behalf of Russell Maroon Shoatz is still active. The Abolitionist Law Center and the rest of Maroon's legal team will continue our work on his behalf, until we are assured that he cannot simply be placed back into solitary confinement at the arbitrary whim of prison officials. <br/></p><p>Our work on behalf of Arthur Johnson is also moving forward. We are in the preparatory stages of bringing a lawsuit to end his 34 consecutive years of solitary confinement. These preparations include gathering documentary records, client visits, legal research, and organizing educational programs to inform the public about Arthur's case. <br/></p><p>The Abolitionist Law Center thanks all our donors for 
your support, without which this victory would not be possible. The 
fight continues, both on behalf of Maroon and the many other prisoners 
being subjected to inhumane conditions. We ask you and everyone else concerned with the inhumane conditions in Pennsylvania's prison to continue to support us in our work to end the practice of long-term solitary confinement. </p><h3><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal;""><h3><br/></h3>
<h3>About our Work</h3></span></h3><p>The <a href=""http://abolitionistlawcenter.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Abolitionist Law Center</a> (ALC) was founded in February 2013, with the goal of ending human rights abuses in the Pennsylvania prison system. We believe that prolonged solitary confinement is one of the most severe human rights abuses inside the prison walls. We are working to put an end to it by advocating for the release of those who have been in solitary confinement for the longest, and by educating the public more generally about these human rights abuses. <br/></p><p>A prisoner held in solitary confinement lives in a 9x7 room with no human contact for 23-24 hours a day. These conditions are generally believed to cause serious mental illness and emotional suffering, particularly as the duration of solitary confinement increases. A recent <a href=""http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/spl/documents/cresson_findings_5-31-13.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: rgb(17, 85, 204) !important; text-decoration: underline !important;"">Department of Justice investigation</a> of Pennsylvania's use of solitary confinement found that it was causing prisoners to suffer a range of serious mental disorders, which in turn caused many prisoners to engage in self-mutilation or attempt suicide. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture has <a href=""http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11506&amp;"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">stated</a> that solitary confinement lasting longer than 15 days is cruel and unusual punishment and possibly torture. There are currently over 2,000 prisoners being held in solitary confinement in the Pennsylvania prison system. Many of these prisoners are held in solitary confinement for years, and sometimes for decades.</p><h3><br/></h3><h3>Extreme Cases of Solitary Confinement</h3><p>We are currently suing Pennsylvania Department of Corrections officials on behalf of our client, Russell 'Maroon' Shoatz, who is a 70 year old man who has been held in continuous solitary confinement for 22 years. Bret Grote (Executive Director of the ALC) recently discussed Maroon's case in detail at a panel on political prisoners and solitary confinement, which can be viewed <a href=""http://youtu.be/ECZXYJ59084?t=11m50s"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. The case was recently <a href=""http://youtu.be/w8OSVtY1Tqg?t=18m11s"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">profiled on Democracy Now!</a>, as well. We are also organizing an advocacy campaign on behalf of <a href=""http://abolitionistlawcenter.org/2013/10/21/action-alert-demand-an-end-to-arthur-cetewayo-johnsons-34-years-in-solitary-confinement/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Arthur Johnson</a>, a 61 year old man who has been held in continuous solitary confinement for 34 years. We will be filing a lawsuit in his case too, once we raise the necessary funds. <br/></p><p>Success in these cases means gaining release from solitary confinement for Maroon and Arthur. However, winning their release from solitary confinement will also help free the thousands of other prisoners being held in long-term isolation by establishing administrative and legal precedents that limit the allowable duration of solitary confinement, and by creating political pressure to end the practice entirely.</p><p><br/></p><h3>What We Need</h3><p>All donations are tax-deductible and will be used to pay for costs related to Arthur and Maroon's cases. For instance, travel to meet with Maroon and Arthur costs about $250 per trip. We generally visit them once or twice a month. Obtaining copies of important records can cost anywhere from $300 to $1,500. We need to get copies of Arthur's prison records going back to 1979. We are also awaiting responses from the federal Bureau of Prisons and the FBI regarding Freedom of Information Act requests for Maroon's records, which may end up costing several hundred dollars. We will have to pay between $400 and $500 to file Arthur Johnson's lawsuit. The cost of obtaining expert witnesses and conducting depositions is difficult to estimate with any accuracy, but it will be many thousands of dollars.  </p><p>Donations will also be used to pay our full-time legal staff. Beginning in February, we will have one full-time attorney earning $500 per week. To put this in perspective, it <a href=""http://solitarywatch.com/2013/06/01/gao-report-questions-widespread-use-of-solitary-confinement-in-federal-prisons/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: rgb(17, 85, 204) !important; text-decoration: underline !important;"">costs taxpayers</a> approximately $78,000 per year to hold a single prisoner in solitary confinement. It costs us less than half that amount to employ one full-time attorney for a year, and run a law office with the purpose of getting prisoners out of solitary confinement. <br/></p><p>Raised funds will be used to pursue Maroon and Arthur's cases, and to further educate the public about the use of solitary confinement in prisons, whether or not the fundraising goal is met. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>Please share this campaign with everyone you know.

February 20, 2014: Pittsburgh, PA -- Russell Maroon Shoatz was released from solitary confinement into the general prison population at State Correctional Institution (SCI) Graterford this morning, ending more than 22 consecutive years in solitary confinement. The news was confirmed by Maroon during a legal call with an attorney from the Abolitionist Law Center.Abolitionist Law Center Executive Director, Bret Grote, said, ""My talk 
with Maroon today was very moving. There are no words to adequately 
convey the significance of his release to the general population for him
 and his family. This is a significant victory for a growing people's 
movement against solitary confinement and the human rights violations 
inherent in mass incarceration. If we continue to work hard and support 
one another in this movement, these victories could very well become a 
habit.""Maroon's son, Russell Shoatz III, said, ""We are very excited that this day has finally come. My father being released from solitary confinement is proof of the power of people organizing against injustice, and the importance of building strong coalitions. I especially want to thank all of those who have supported the collective struggle to end my father's solitary confinement, including my siblings and members of the Shoatz family, the Human Rights Coalition, Abolitionist Law Center, Scientific Soul Sessions, the entire legal team, UN Special Rapporteur Juan Mendez, the 5 Nobel Peace Laureates, the National Lawyers Guild, Center for Constitutional Rights, along with the dozens of other organizations and thousands of individuals who have participated in this effort.""What's Next?The litigation on behalf of Russell Maroon Shoatz is still active. The Abolitionist Law Center and the rest of Maroon's legal team will continue our work on his behalf, until we are assured that he cannot simply be placed back into solitary confinement at the arbitrary whim of prison officials. Our work on behalf of Arthur Johnson is also moving forward. We are in the preparatory stages of bringing a lawsuit to end his 34 consecutive years of solitary confinement. These preparations include gathering documentary records, client visits, legal research, and organizing educational programs to inform the public about Arthur's case. The Abolitionist Law Center thanks all our donors for 
your support, without which this victory would not be possible. The 
fight continues, both on behalf of Maroon and the many other prisoners 
being subjected to inhumane conditions. We ask you and everyone else concerned with the inhumane conditions in Pennsylvania's prison to continue to support us in our work to end the practice of long-term solitary confinement. 
About our WorkThe Abolitionist Law Center (ALC) was founded in February 2013, with the goal of ending human rights abuses in the Pennsylvania prison system. We believe that prolonged solitary confinement is one of the most severe human rights abuses inside the prison walls. We are working to put an end to it by advocating for the release of those who have been in solitary confinement for the longest, and by educating the public more generally about these human rights abuses. A prisoner held in solitary confinement lives in a 9x7 room with no human contact for 23-24 hours a day. These conditions are generally believed to cause serious mental illness and emotional suffering, particularly as the duration of solitary confinement increases. A recent Department of Justice investigation of Pennsylvania's use of solitary confinement found that it was causing prisoners to suffer a range of serious mental disorders, which in turn caused many prisoners to engage in self-mutilation or attempt suicide. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture has stated that solitary confinement lasting longer than 15 days is cruel and unusual punishment and possibly torture. There are currently over 2,000 prisoners being held in solitary confinement in the Pennsylvania prison system. Many of these prisoners are held in solitary confinement for years, and sometimes for decades.Extreme Cases of Solitary ConfinementWe are currently suing Pennsylvania Department of Corrections officials on behalf of our client, Russell 'Maroon' Shoatz, who is a 70 year old man who has been held in continuous solitary confinement for 22 years. Bret Grote (Executive Director of the ALC) recently discussed Maroon's case in detail at a panel on political prisoners and solitary confinement, which can be viewed here. The case was recently profiled on Democracy Now!, as well. We are also organizing an advocacy campaign on behalf of Arthur Johnson, a 61 year old man who has been held in continuous solitary confinement for 34 years. We will be filing a lawsuit in his case too, once we raise the necessary funds. Success in these cases means gaining release from solitary confinement for Maroon and Arthur. However, winning their release from solitary confinement will also help free the thousands of other prisoners being held in long-term isolation by establishing administrative and legal precedents that limit the allowable duration of solitary confinement, and by creating political pressure to end the practice entirely.What We NeedAll donations are tax-deductible and will be used to pay for costs related to Arthur and Maroon's cases. For instance, travel to meet with Maroon and Arthur costs about $250 per trip. We generally visit them once or twice a month. Obtaining copies of important records can cost anywhere from $300 to $1,500. We need to get copies of Arthur's prison records going back to 1979. We are also awaiting responses from the federal Bureau of Prisons and the FBI regarding Freedom of Information Act requests for Maroon's records, which may end up costing several hundred dollars. We will have to pay between $400 and $500 to file Arthur Johnson's lawsuit. The cost of obtaining expert witnesses and conducting depositions is difficult to estimate with any accuracy, but it will be many thousands of dollars.  Donations will also be used to pay our full-time legal staff. Beginning in February, we will have one full-time attorney earning $500 per week. To put this in perspective, it costs taxpayers approximately $78,000 per year to hold a single prisoner in solitary confinement. It costs us less than half that amount to employ one full-time attorney for a year, and run a law office with the purpose of getting prisoners out of solitary confinement. Raised funds will be used to pursue Maroon and Arthur's cases, and to further educate the public about the use of solitary confinement in prisons, whether or not the fundraising goal is met.

Inside was a cricket.     </p>
<p>    “What do you think, sir?” </p>
<p>    The Admiral stroked the ring around his beak with his third tentacle. “It looks awful enough. Is it an aggressive creature?” </p>

<p>    “No.”</p>
<p>    The next Vyperian presented yet another creature in a cage. “This, my lord, is what the earthlings call a cobra. A specimen this size has enough venom to kill 200 humans. It is widely feared across the globe, even by races that aren’t likely to see such a creature in their lifetimes.”  </p>
<p>    “Does it make any awful noises?”  </p>
<p>    “No, my Lord, it is silent.”</p>
<p>    The cobra reared up inside the cage and spread its hood while locking gaze with the Admiral. With two tentacles, Admiral Zeezak swooped the plastic cage away from the other Vyperian and brought it up to his eyes. The cobra remained still for just another moment, and then it struck, struck, struck again, leaving smears of venom all across the inside of the cage where its fangs had hit.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>Bacterial lenses</strong> -Discover the relationship between the bacterial world and every other life form and how this interaction has shaped the way we live in from its very beginning to this very moment, and how it will continue doing so in the near future.</p>
<p>My name is David Medina and I am the author of <strong>Bacterial Lenses</strong>. I wrote this book because I felt that there was an important lack of perspective available to people who wanted to understand the origin and development of human history from a different point of view than those we are often told in college or regular books. Normally, when someone asks “how did we get here, to this exact moment”, we have access to a vast array of information coming from anthropology, geology, biology, and other sciences. However, I have been missing for quite a long time the involvement of bacteria in all these events, this is the reason why I decided to use their perspective in this book and tell everything from their metaphoric lenses if they had ones. <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover a different perspective and vision of how bacteria have helped to shape the true nature of the existence that we all enjoy today, and how they have been key players in our evolution and development throughout history. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for microbiology and the bacterial world in you. And then, ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you understand all that has ever happened and will ever take place on this planet from a completely different perspective, one coming from a world that you cannot see with naked eyes.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about microbiology and anthropology :</p>
<p>How bacteria shaped the behavior of unicellular organisms to start turning into communities that gave rise to multicellular life forms, the earliest ancestors of every other complex life form in the planet</p>
<p>How bacteria have helped the creation of society, moving the first humans from isolated groups to settlements that triggered important cultural exchanges that settled the principles of what we are today</p>
<p>How bacteria have shaped the evolution of humanity, impacted entire civilizations and allowed both extraordinary catastrophes and scientific miracles</p>
<p>You will love this book if you have some degree of curiosity in microbiology or biological sciences, or you are just craving for some general quick and accessible knowledge in scientific topics around bacteria. <br/><br/>Bacterial lenses is a non-fiction book that speaks to the college student, life science professional or anyone who is looking at the intersection between microbiology and human history for the first time.</p>
<h3>The Book - Bacterial lenses</h3>
<p>The book is written in 5 parts:<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the introduction + Chapters 1-4. In this section, you will learn the impact that the bacterial world had in the early development of every other life form on the planet and how they were able to colonize and spread all over the surface of the primitive Earth. One of the section’s stories will show you how they sought to populate the Earth; bacteria changed the composition of the atmosphere and triggered the biggest massive extinction that the planet has ever seen. You will also come to understand the importance of the bacterial influence in the switch between unicellular and multicellular life, which ultimately gave rise to all the complex organisms we know today. <br/><br/>Part 2 contains Chapters 5-9. Here, you will learn the importance of bacteria in the birth and rise of the first human societies and civilizations, from the moment that our hominid-like ancestors left Africa to the end of the biggest bacterial pandemic that the entire world has ever faced, The Black Death. One of this section’s stories will show you how bacteria impacted the development of the first societies and how they were able to use the establishment of humans in bigger groups to unleash some of the earliest forms of human diseases. Additionally, you will learn more about the quasi-apocalyptic impact that bacteria had in the spread of the Black Death, whose consequences are apparent even nowadays in practices such as quarantine and hygiene. <br/><br/>Part 3 contains Chapters 10-12. In this section, you will learn about how the construction of microscopes and the curiosity of a growing scientific community led to the birth of bacteriology, which changed the way we humans interact with bacteria. In these chapters, you will learn how the obsession of a young Dutch scientist changed the world forever when he was able to observe the unseen microscopic world. You will also learn about the seven cholera pandemics that have been ravaging the world since the early XIX century and their impact in societies who are still suffering. <br/><br/>Part 4 contains Chapters 13-14. Here, you will learn about the rise and fall of antibiotics through the golden era of antibiotic discovery, and how a miracle drug that saved so many lives became the match that burned our dreams of a better future. In some of the stories of this section, you will learn about the scientific passion of Alexander Fleming and how a lucky mistake turned to become the biggest revolution in medicine that humankind has ever seen. You will also learn about how the world has been turning its’ back on a growing problem whose outcome and consequences our generation has had to carry the burden of. <br/><br/>Part 5 contains Chapters 15-18. In this section, You will get a deep understanding of antibiotic resistance: how it works, which factors are altering its behavior and how human’s activities are making the problem worse. You will also learn about the alternatives to the use of antibiotics that we are using to face the problem and about what the future might look like whether we win this war or not. Over this section, you will learn about authentic superbugs that are silently spreading all over the world that are resistant to whatever we throw at them, and that fighting bacteria might not be the only way to end a war that we are destined to lose.  </p>

Bacterial lenses -Discover the relationship between the bacterial world and every other life form and how this interaction has shaped the way we live in from its very beginning to this very moment, and how it will continue doing so in the near future.
My name is David Medina and I am the author of Bacterial Lenses. I wrote this book because I felt that there was an important lack of perspective available to people who wanted to understand the origin and development of human history from a different point of view than those we are often told in college or regular books. Normally, when someone asks “how did we get here, to this exact moment”, we have access to a vast array of information coming from anthropology, geology, biology, and other sciences. However, I have been missing for quite a long time the involvement of bacteria in all these events, this is the reason why I decided to use their perspective in this book and tell everything from their metaphoric lenses if they had ones. My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover a different perspective and vision of how bacteria have helped to shape the true nature of the existence that we all enjoy today, and how they have been key players in our evolution and development throughout history. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for microbiology and the bacterial world in you. And then, ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you understand all that has ever happened and will ever take place on this planet from a completely different perspective, one coming from a world that you cannot see with naked eyes.In this book, you'll learn about microbiology and anthropology :
How bacteria shaped the behavior of unicellular organisms to start turning into communities that gave rise to multicellular life forms, the earliest ancestors of every other complex life form in the planet
How bacteria have helped the creation of society, moving the first humans from isolated groups to settlements that triggered important cultural exchanges that settled the principles of what we are today
How bacteria have shaped the evolution of humanity, impacted entire civilizations and allowed both extraordinary catastrophes and scientific miracles
You will love this book if you have some degree of curiosity in microbiology or biological sciences, or you are just craving for some general quick and accessible knowledge in scientific topics around bacteria. Bacterial lenses is a non-fiction book that speaks to the college student, life science professional or anyone who is looking at the intersection between microbiology and human history for the first time.
The Book - Bacterial lenses
The book is written in 5 parts:Part 1 contains the introduction + Chapters 1-4. In this section, you will learn the impact that the bacterial world had in the early development of every other life form on the planet and how they were able to colonize and spread all over the surface of the primitive Earth. One of the section’s stories will show you how they sought to populate the Earth; bacteria changed the composition of the atmosphere and triggered the biggest massive extinction that the planet has ever seen. You will also come to understand the importance of the bacterial influence in the switch between unicellular and multicellular life, which ultimately gave rise to all the complex organisms we know today. Part 2 contains Chapters 5-9. Here, you will learn the importance of bacteria in the birth and rise of the first human societies and civilizations, from the moment that our hominid-like ancestors left Africa to the end of the biggest bacterial pandemic that the entire world has ever faced, The Black Death. One of this section’s stories will show you how bacteria impacted the development of the first societies and how they were able to use the establishment of humans in bigger groups to unleash some of the earliest forms of human diseases.

<h2>Behind My Book</h2>
<p>Manipulated Memories is a distorted collection of prose, self-affirmations, and short stories that explore self-love, mental health, and the journey of life when your own mind is against you.<br/><br/>My name is S.E. Anthony, and I am the author of Manipulated Memories. I crafted this book because, amid my daily journaling and my self-discovery, I realized I did not know if my reality was distorted or if my memories were manipulated. In this collection, I peel back the layers of the growth that is possible after destruction. I explore the deranged reality of battling with oneself, I talk myself out of death and heartbreak time and time again, and I question my lineage and my mother's scars.<br/><br/>By reading this collection, you will discover a thin line between dreams and reality. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to explore yourself, your healing, and your memories in a new light. I changed my life trajectory through writing. I hope my poems speak to you and bring you many beautiful experiences.<br/><br/>In this book, you will join me in carefully dissecting self-love, mental health, healing, resilience, vulnerability, and self-worth through poems like:</p>
<p>""Brown Skin Girl"" — Brown skin girl opens the door to self-worth and explores the importance of rest</p>
<p>""All too well"" — A poem about transparency and battling with oneself</p>
<p>""Owe It"" — A morning mantra that emphasizes self-love, self-worth, and setting boundaries</p>
<p>This book is an open love letter to everyone. You will adore this book if you are battling with mental health, are beginning or have already begun your self-love journey, appreciate positive self-affirmations, or simply enjoy poetry.<br/><br/>Manipulated Memories speaks to anyone who knows that healing is not linear and that there is no blueprint to self-discovery. I look forward to exploring mental health and self-love with my readers. I believe it will change us all for the better.</p>

<h3><u>The Book:</u></h3>
<p><strong>THREE</strong> years ago, Benjamin Benoit and myself, set out to discover who the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence are.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554085471/fpzdlrtvbhlxcu95uj38.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><u><strong>The result: </strong></u>A 200 page book documenting The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence through personal interviews and stunning photography. (<i>Yes, it is completed and ready to order.)</i></p>
<p>In bright make-up and Nuns habits, San Francisco’s drag nuns are a well-established cultural fixture. The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence formed in 1979 as an “<i>order of queer nuns</i>”. Since then, they’ve become a powerful presence for charity and social activism, across the country and the world.</p>
<p>This spectacular journey into the irreverent, compassionate world of these queer activists offers a rare glimpse at the remarkable people behind the habits. Who are these nuns? What is The Sisterhood? How did they find themselves within it?</p>
<p><i>Sister Stories…in their own words</i>… is a compelling look at a cultural movement, an important piece of queer history, and gorgeous piece of art.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>NOW the Coast to Coast Tour BEGINS!</h3>

<p>I have taken the next FOUR months off work to take a train across the country, visiting Sister Houses and hosting interactive conversations with Sisters and their communities. </p>

<p>This is NOT your typical book signing, but an in-depth deep dive into LGBTQ+ history, culture and rights; where they have been and where they go in the future.</p>

</div></div>","The Book:
THREE years ago, Benjamin Benoit and myself, set out to discover who the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence are.

The result: A 200 page book documenting The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence through personal interviews and stunning photography. (Yes, it is completed and ready to order.)
In bright make-up and Nuns habits, San Francisco’s drag nuns are a well-established cultural fixture. The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence formed in 1979 as an “order of queer nuns”. Since then, they’ve become a powerful presence for charity and social activism, across the country and the world.
This spectacular journey into the irreverent, compassionate world of these queer activists offers a rare glimpse at the remarkable people behind the habits. Who are these nuns? What is The Sisterhood? How did they find themselves within it?
Sister Stories…in their own words… is a compelling look at a cultural movement, an important piece of queer history, and gorgeous piece of art.

NOW the Coast to Coast Tour BEGINS!

I have taken the next FOUR months off work to take a train across the country, visiting Sister Houses and hosting interactive conversations with Sisters and their communities. 

This is NOT your typical book signing, but an in-depth deep dive into LGBTQ+ history, culture and rights; where they have been and where they go in the future.

I will be visiting so many places, including San Diego, Sacramento, Nashville, Memphis, Alabama, Arkansas, New Orleans and many more.

I have created a fantastic shirt to commemorate the occasion! Here is a little video of the 1st shirt coming off the press!

Additionally, I will be interviewing Sisters across the country for Book #2 in the Series: Sister Stories...from the Road!

The Impact:

Sister Stories is much more than just a book; it is a social movement, an opportunity to build bridges of communication and learn about a culture and history that many may not know exists. To that end:
20% of net proceeds from the sale of Sister Stories and associated art, is donated to the Sisters General Fund. In the interest of transparency, monies will be distributed via an outside source, tax specialist, Joel Levine. 

Challenge--it's always $!
I have spent three years fundraising and making Sister Stories...in their own words,  a reality AND making it accessible and affordable. Now that I have done that, I need to get Sister Stories in the hands of people across the country and the world AND begin creating Book #2!
I hope you will join the journey and adventure! Here we go!​

<h2><strong>Story of My Book</strong></h2>
<p><i>See Me</i> is about the importance of living authentically as a young adult. My book aims to inspire young adults to stay true to who they are through guiding principles and the incredible stories of others who have mastered the art of authentic living.<br/><br/>My name is Hailey Rodgers and I am the author of <i>See Me</i>. I wrote this book because I believe every human being is exceptional and I believe when you are a young adult, it is the hardest time to believe that about yourself. I have discovered key principles throughout my journey as a young adult along with the incredible stories of others on how we can all embrace our inner weirdness and be inspired to live an authentic life.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the value in staying true to who are and embrace being your weird as f*ck self (yes there is swearing, and no the book is not censored). In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for authentic living in you. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you stay true to who you are amidst the pressure to conform to societal norms. <br/><br/>In this book, you will learn about three broad interconnected topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to be authentic<ul><li>In this part, you will unravel the art of authentic living through various topics including: self-awareness, self-comparisons, self-love, body image, etc.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>How to be happy<ul><li>In this part, we will discuss ways on how we can optimize our time being happy and how to handle the inevitable times where we won’t be.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>How to be successful<ul><li>In this part, we will come to a final definition of success, and that’s for you to find out.</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you are a young adult who feels they haven’t been truly seen for who they are (yet).<br/><br/><i>See Me</i> is a non-fiction book that speaks to Millennials and Gen Zers who are looking to discover how to be authentic, happy and successful for the first time.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>The Book - <i>See Me</i></strong></h2>
<p>The book is written in 3 Parts...<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the introduction and various chapters that aim to unravel the art of authentic living. This section will dive into various topics including self-awareness, self-comparisons, self-love, body image, caring, etc. Various stories help illustrate these topics so that you can see how these principles can be truly lived by. One story in relation to body image is about a young girl named Faith who recently recovered from Anorexia Nervosa, a severe eating disorder. Another story helps demonstrate the concept of caring (about the things that matter to you). This story is about a guy named Jordan who decided to drop out of school and instead focus on his passion for music and crafting drums. He now makes drums for various famous bands across Canada including the Arkells, July Talk, The Strumbellas, and Half Moon Run. <br/><br/>Part 2 explores the idea of happiness. This part emphasizes how to optimize our time being happy on this planet while at the same time being able to cope when we are otherwise not. The topics include gratitude, forgiveness, purposeful living, and helping others be happy as well. Purposeful living is illustrated by Christian, who found his purpose through magic and does various performances for large audience shows. Helping others be happy is illustrated by Hanna who always aims to help others reach their most optimal state of happiness and wellness. <br/><br/>Part 3 defines the concept of success. The reader will learn what success truly means and topics including mindfulness will help illustrate what true success looks like. Mindfulness is complemented by Shanshan’s story, a yoga instructor, outdoor and travel guru who understands what it truly means to be intrinsically successful.<br/> </p>

<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.<br/><br/>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.</p>

</div></div>","Story of My Book
See Me is about the importance of living authentically as a young adult. My book aims to inspire young adults to stay true to who they are through guiding principles and the incredible stories of others who have mastered the art of authentic living.My name is Hailey Rodgers and I am the author of See Me. I wrote this book because I believe every human being is exceptional and I believe when you are a young adult, it is the hardest time to believe that about yourself. I have discovered key principles throughout my journey as a young adult along with the incredible stories of others on how we can all embrace our inner weirdness and be inspired to live an authentic life.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the value in staying true to who are and embrace being your weird as f*ck self (yes there is swearing, and no the book is not censored). In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for authentic living in you. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you stay true to who you are amidst the pressure to conform to societal norms. In this book, you will learn about three broad interconnected topics:

How to be authenticIn this part, you will unravel the art of authentic living through various topics including: self-awareness, self-comparisons, self-love, body image, etc.

How to be happyIn this part, we will discuss ways on how we can optimize our time being happy and how to handle the inevitable times where we won’t be.

How to be successfulIn this part, we will come to a final definition of success, and that’s for you to find out.


You will love this book if you are a young adult who feels they haven’t been truly seen for who they are (yet).See Me is a non-fiction book that speaks to Millennials and Gen Zers who are looking to discover how to be authentic, happy and successful for the first time.
 
The Book - See Me
The book is written in 3 Parts...Part 1 contains the introduction and various chapters that aim to unravel the art of authentic living. This section will dive into various topics including self-awareness, self-comparisons, self-love, body image, caring, etc. Various stories help illustrate these topics so that you can see how these principles can be truly lived by. One story in relation to body image is about a young girl named Faith who recently recovered from Anorexia Nervosa, a severe eating disorder. Another story helps demonstrate the concept of caring (about the things that matter to you). This story is about a guy named Jordan who decided to drop out of school and instead focus on his passion for music and crafting drums. He now makes drums for various famous bands across Canada including the Arkells, July Talk, The Strumbellas, and Half Moon Run. Part 2 explores the idea of happiness. This part emphasizes how to optimize our time being happy on this planet while at the same time being able to cope when we are otherwise not. The topics include gratitude, forgiveness, purposeful living, and helping others be happy as well. Purposeful living is illustrated by Christian, who found his purpose through magic and does various performances for large audience shows. Helping others be happy is illustrated by Hanna who always aims to help others reach their most optimal state of happiness and wellness. Part 3 defines the concept of success. The reader will learn what success truly means and topics including mindfulness will help illustrate what true success looks like. Mindfulness is complemented by Shanshan’s story, a yoga instructor, outdoor and travel guru who understands what it truly means to be intrinsically successful.

I started Chasing Fae midway through my senior year of high school. There was an incident with a group of people, typical high school drama, but I ended up losing contact with a very good friend of mine whom I considered a brother. I was tired of feeling left behind, abandoned, so I decided to take my pain and frustration and turn it into something productive.<br/><br/>Chasing Fae was born out of a need to preserve that sibling-like relationship. But as I began to draft, it became so much more than that. The world came to life, the characters took their first breaths, and I watched a whole new story rise.<br/><br/>My main character, Grace, is an introverted young woman who recharges on her own and tends to keep to herself. But she’s a leader in her own right; when faced with a challenge, she attacks it head-on with a stubborn fierceness that will inspire. The universe that Chasing Fae is set in involves three distinct realms, each with their own appeal. The Upper Realm is Fae and made up of twelve distinct Noble Houses with their own cultures and magical qualities. The Middle Realm is mortal and in a struggle to survive. The Lower Realm is the demon realm, a forbidden space to both mortals and Fae and a land wrapped up in secrets.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will be captivated by the strong protagonist and the fantastic, immersive universe.<br/><br/>Chasing Fae is a young adult fantasy novel and the first of a planned trilogy. You will love this book if you’re a fantasy person, if you’re a fan of work by Sarah J. Maas or Cassandra Clare. If you want to get hooked on a new series, this book is for you. If you’re looking for political intrigue with a side of budding romance, pick up a copy. If you want a fierce introverted leader who takes life into her own hands, Chasing Fae is what you’re looking for.</p><p> </p><h2>The Book - Chasing Fae</h2><p>Grace Richardson is a young mortal woman whose only concerns are providing for her family, playing her violin, and spending as much time as possible with her brother, Leo. When Leo goes into service in the Fae’s world as a mercenary, she expects him to return with the honor that he deserves.<br/><br/>When Leo suddenly dies in an unspecified accident, not a word, medal, or penny comes down from the higher ups. Suspecting foul play, Grace disguises herself as a Fae and sneaks into the Upper Realm to get some answers. She anticipated being in way over her head. But did she anticipate a Fae soldier who catches her fleeing an angry bar and discovers her identity only a day in? Not so much.<br/><br/>Now Grace is forced to drag this Fae soldier, Aiden, along as she tries to work out exactly how and why her brother died. Along the way, she has no choice but to confront her prejudices against the Fae as she attempts to sort out the difference between the honest and the dishonest. Political conspiracies, demon realm escapades, and family secrets will all lead Grace to the answers she’s looking for… and some that she isn’t.</p><p> </p><h2>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h2><p>This book will be published with New Degree Press.

</ul><p> </p><h2>About the Author</h2><p>Cady Hammer is a college student studying history and anthropology at the College of William and Mary. Cady spent much of her childhood coming up with stories and plays to put on with her friends and her younger sister, Morgan. Everything from a story about a girl locked in a tower that she and her friends performed in the sandbox, to Uglydoll stories amid the highest playground structure, and plenty of doll plays with her sister (though Cady will never take credit for the few she came up with; she prefers to let people think Morgan is the only one with the crazy ideas).<br/><br/>She wrote her first novel when she was eleven years old between classes and during her lunch period (a piece of work that will never again see the light of day), and since then, she has been determined to publish a book someday. She constantly toyed around with ideas from contemporary romance to dramatic adventure stories until she finally settled on writing a fantasy novel, which really, she always knew would eventually be her desired genre. Cady Hammer is so excited to bring Chasing Fae to the world, the incredible fantastical culmination of a two-year effort.<br/><br/>For more information you can connect with Cady at cadyahammer@gmail.com, on her website at <a href=""http://www.fluffaboutfantasy.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.fluffaboutfantasy.com</a>, or on her social media platforms on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest.</p><p> </p><h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2><p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you.

<br/><br/>Best,<br/>Cady Hammer</h3></div>","Story of My BookChasing Fae is an epic fantasy novel about finding yourself when everything else is against you and learning how to trust after loss.My name is Cady Hammer, and I am the author of Chasing Fae. I started Chasing Fae midway through my senior year of high school. There was an incident with a group of people, typical high school drama, but I ended up losing contact with a very good friend of mine whom I considered a brother. I was tired of feeling left behind, abandoned, so I decided to take my pain and frustration and turn it into something productive.Chasing Fae was born out of a need to preserve that sibling-like relationship. But as I began to draft, it became so much more than that. The world came to life, the characters took their first breaths, and I watched a whole new story rise.My main character, Grace, is an introverted young woman who recharges on her own and tends to keep to herself. But she’s a leader in her own right; when faced with a challenge, she attacks it head-on with a stubborn fierceness that will inspire. The universe that Chasing Fae is set in involves three distinct realms, each with their own appeal. The Upper Realm is Fae and made up of twelve distinct Noble Houses with their own cultures and magical qualities. The Middle Realm is mortal and in a struggle to survive. The Lower Realm is the demon realm, a forbidden space to both mortals and Fae and a land wrapped up in secrets.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will be captivated by the strong protagonist and the fantastic, immersive universe.Chasing Fae is a young adult fantasy novel and the first of a planned trilogy. You will love this book if you’re a fantasy person, if you’re a fan of work by Sarah J. Maas or Cassandra Clare. If you want to get hooked on a new series, this book is for you. If you’re looking for political intrigue with a side of budding romance, pick up a copy. If you want a fierce introverted leader who takes life into her own hands, Chasing Fae is what you’re looking for. The Book - Chasing FaeGrace Richardson is a young mortal woman whose only concerns are providing for her family, playing her violin, and spending as much time as possible with her brother, Leo. When Leo goes into service in the Fae’s world as a mercenary, she expects him to return with the honor that he deserves.When Leo suddenly dies in an unspecified accident, not a word, medal, or penny comes down from the higher ups. Suspecting foul play, Grace disguises herself as a Fae and sneaks into the Upper Realm to get some answers. She anticipated being in way over her head. But did she anticipate a Fae soldier who catches her fleeing an angry bar and discovers her identity only a day in? Not so much.Now Grace is forced to drag this Fae soldier, Aiden, along as she tries to work out exactly how and why her brother died. Along the way, she has no choice but to confront her prejudices against the Fae as she attempts to sort out the difference between the honest and the dishonest. Political conspiracies, demon realm escapades, and family secrets will all lead Grace to the answers she’s looking for… and some that she isn’t. What I Need & What You'll GetThis book will be published with New Degree Press.

 About the AuthorCady Hammer is a college student studying history and anthropology at the College of William and Mary. Cady spent much of her childhood coming up with stories and plays to put on with her friends and her younger sister, Morgan. Everything from a story about a girl locked in a tower that she and her friends performed in the sandbox, to Uglydoll stories amid the highest playground structure, and plenty of doll plays with her sister (though Cady will never take credit for the few she came up with; she prefers to let people think Morgan is the only one with the crazy ideas).She wrote her first novel when she was eleven years old between classes and during her lunch period (a piece of work that will never again see the light of day), and since then, she has been determined to publish a book someday. She constantly toyed around with ideas from contemporary romance to dramatic adventure stories until she finally settled on writing a fantasy novel, which really, she always knew would eventually be her desired genre. Cady Hammer is so excited to bring Chasing Fae to the world, the incredible fantastical culmination of a two-year effort.For more information you can connect with Cady at cadyahammer@gmail.com, on her website at www.fluffaboutfantasy.com, or on her social media platforms on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest. Risks & ChallengesThe biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you.

<p><strong>(Voor de Nederlandstalige uiteenzetting, scrol naar beneden.)<br/><br/>ENGLISH<br/><br/><u>Who</u></strong><strong> are we?</strong></p>
<p>The book “Fixing My Gaze” saved my life. My name is Michael Lievens. I have been cross-eyed since the age of three and have had a pretty horrible experience dealing with it. The abnormal development of my vision created reading and learning difficulties, fatigue, confusing double vision and functional problems. When reaching out to the medical community, I underwent three strabismus surgeries which actually made things worse! Up until the age of 20, when I finally discovered the book “Fixing My Gaze”, I had never even heard of optometric vision therapy or neuro-visual rehabilitation as a safer and more effective alternative to eye muscle surgery.</p>
<p>Ever since that discovery I’ve been trying to get the word out in order to help other patients. Surgery is not the only treatment option for strabismus or crossed eyes! In the process I’ve started various Dutch and English language websites, appeared in a national Belgian newspaper and was interviewed on the radio about this very subject. More recently, in 2017, some friends and I have set up a Dutch language strabismus patient NGO (Vereniging Der Strabismepatiënten) to inform patients about their treatment options and protect their interests.</p>
<p><strong><u>Why</u></strong><strong> is this project important?</strong></p>
<p>The book “Fixing My Gaze” contained crucial information that got me through a very difficult period in my life. It provided me with an explanation of why everything had been so difficult up until that point as well as with a scientifically founded reason to believe that vision improvement was still possible.</p>
<p>Unfortunately language barriers are still an issue for many people looking for help and information, certainly those with vision related learning difficulties. I broke through that language barrier and discovered the book just in time but others might not, or might lose valuable time doing so. This is exactly why we need a Dutch version of the book.</p>
<p>Our hope is that people who are familiar with this fabulous book and know about the potential of vision therapy to change lives, are willing to contribute to spreading this knowledge throughout Belgium and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Remembering my astonishment upon reading “Fixing My Gaze” for the first time, I am positive the translation will have a similarly profound effect on many other people. This book will also dramatically improve the lives of many people by enabling them to make informed decisions about their treatment options. “Fixing My Gaze” will show them the way towards true visual recovery.</p>
<p><strong><u>What</u></strong><strong> is the money for?</strong></p>
<p>As we are doing all of the translating ourselves, we are able to do this project at a very low rate. Most book translation or publishing projects go for between 10,000 and 20,000 dollars. We are aiming for 3,500 to 4,000 dollars.</p>
<p>About 2/3 of the money obtained through this fundraiser will go to <strong><i><u>purchasing the Dutch language publishing rights from the American publisher</u></i></strong>. The remaining 1/3 of the funds will cover <strong><i><u>other expenses that go into making a finished product</u></i></strong> such as designing a book cover, hiring a linguist for a final spell and punctuation check, practical costs and marketing. </p>
<p>The money obtained will <strong><i><u>not cover the printing of any physical books</u></i></strong>. The printing costs will be postponed through a “print on demand” formula. This means that once a book is ordered and its payment comes in, only then will the book be printed. That way upfront costs are limited.</p>
<p>In case we exceed our monetary goal, the funds will be used for additional Dutch language initiatives informing parents, patients and the public about noninvasive neuro-visual treatments for strabismus. </p>
<p>Thank you so much for your support! We cannot express just how much we appreciate it!</p>

<p><strong><u>Wie</u> zijn we?</strong></p>
<p>Het boek “Fixing My Gaze” heeft mijn leven gered. Mijn naam is Michael Lievens en op de leeftijd van drie jaar ben ik scheel beginnen zien. Het is vreselijk moeilijk geweest om de verregaande gevolgen hiervan de baas te blijven. De abnormale ontwikkeling van mijn zicht leidde tot lees- en leerproblemen, vermoeidheid, verwarrend dubbel zicht en blijvende functionele problemen. Het inroepen van medische hulp leidde tot drie oogspieroperaties die mijn gebrekkige visuele functionaliteit nog  hebben verslechterd. Tot op de leeftijd van 20 jaar, toen ik eindelijk het boek “Fixing My Gaze” van Susan Barry ontdekte, had ik zelfs nog nooit gehoord van visuele therapie of neuro-visuele revalidatie als een veiliger en doeltreffender alternatief voor chirurgie.</p>
<p>Sinds die verbluffende ontdekking heb ik me onafgebroken ingezet om andere patiënten te informeren. Oogspieroperaties zijn niet de enige behandeling voor strabisme of scheelzien! Al doende heb ik verschillende Nederlandstalige en Engelstalige websites opgericht, ben ik in de Belgische krant ‘De Morgen’ verschenen en werd ik over dit onderwerp geïnterviewd op Radio 1. Tot slot hebben enkele lotgenoten en ik in 2017 de Vereniging Der Strabismepatiënten (VDS) opgericht met een tweeledige doelstelling. Enerzijds het aanbieden van informatie die het patiënten mogelijk maakt geïnformeerde beslissingen te nemen en anderzijds het systematisch verdedigen van de belangen van strabismepatiënten.</p>
<p><strong><u>Waarom</u> is dit project zo belangrijk?</strong></p>
<p>Het boek “Fixing My Gaze” bevat cruciale informatie die me door een zeer moeilijke periode in mijn leven heeft geloodst. Het verschafte een verklaring voor alle moeilijkheden die ik tot dan toe had ondervonden en een wetenschappelijk onderlegde reden om voorzichtig optimistisch te zijn over de toekomst.</p>
<p>Jammer genoeg is het voor veel mensen in hun zoektocht naar informatie en hulp niet vanzelfsprekend de Engelse taalbarrière te overstijgen, zeker niet als oogsamenwerkingsproblemen je leer- en leesvaardigheid belemmeren. Sommigen zullen door de taalbarrière misschien zelfs nooit de waarheid over strabismebehandeling te weten komen of kostbare tijd verliezen. Dit is precies de reden waarom een Nederlandstalige versie van dit boek broodnodig is.</p>
<p>Wij hopen dat sponsors die vertrouwd zijn met dit fantastische boek en met het potentieel van visuele therapie om levens blijvend te veranderen, een kleine bijdrage willen leveren om deze kennis verder te verspreiden in de Lage Landen.</p>
<p>Als ik terugdenk aan hoe versteld ik stond na de eerste lezing van “Fixing My Gaze”, ben ik er zeker van dat de vertaling zijn effect op andere mensen die met scheelzien geconfronteerd worden niet zal missen. Bovendien zal dit  boek  de levens van vele ouders en patiënten substantieel verbeteren door een weloverwogen en geïnformeerde behandelingskeuze mogelijk te maken. Het lezen van “Fixing My Gaze” zal hen de weg naar waarachtig visueel herstel tonen.</p>
<p><strong><u>Waarvoor</u> dient het geld?</strong></p>
<p>Omdat we al het vertaalwerk zelf doen, zal de investeringskost om een Nederlandse vertaling op de markt te brengen relatief laag zijn. De meeste boek- of vertaalprojecten gaan voor een budget van tussen de 10,000 en 20,000 dollar maar omdat we het project zo goedkoop mogelijk willen realiseren, mikken we op een bedrag van tussen de 3,500 en 4,000 dollar.</p>
<p>Ongeveer 2/3e van het opgehaalde bedrag zal gaan naar het <strong><i><u>aankopen van de auteursrechten voor het Nederlandse taalgebied</u></i></strong>. Het resterende geld zal naar <strong><i><u>de afwerking van het boek</u></i></strong> gaan: het ontwerpen van de kaft, het inhuren van een taalkundige voor een finale spelling- en interpunctiecontrole, praktische kosten en marketing.</p>
<p>Het opgehaalde bedrag <strong><i><u>dekt evenwel niet het drukken van de fysieke boeken</u></i></strong>. De drukkosten worden uitgesteld tot op het moment dat een boek effectief besteld wordt.

<p>In geval we het vooropgestelde bedrag zouden overschrijden, zullen de bijkomstige middelen gebruikt worden voor aanvullende VDS initiatieven die ouders, patiënten en het grote publiek informeren over het bestaan van non-invasieve, neuro-visuele revalidatie voor scheelzien.</p>

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p>My name is Jackson Vines and I am the author of <i>Star-Studded</i>. I wrote this book because I am passionate about sports, baseball specifically, and I want to contribute to the development of the game any way I can. This book has given me an avenue to give my input on the changes we are seeing in the sports world today, such as how we evaluate and value athletes at the highest level of competition.<br/><br/>The world of sports has a small group of individuals who dominate the game they play and our attention, but the way these superstars come about and how we categorize them as such can be explained in a number of ways. This book sheds light on various perspectives of what value top-tier players generate for their teams, as well as the impact they make in and out of the industry.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover a new perspective or way of thinking about how we view elite talent and how we affect their journey to stardom. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for the changing landscape of baseball player evaluation in you. Ultimately I want you to use this book to adopt a process of determining what you consider to be a superstar ballplayer by expanding your mindset and discovering what you value in an athlete.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn what people outside the sport consider superstar material and what kind of player those inside the sport are currently marketing as superstars. Some examples both parties are valuing currently are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personality - using charisma as a selling point to fans</li>
<li>Youth - bringing a new energy to the game and keeping up with the modern world</li>
<li>Diversity - finding unique backgrounds and stories to tell</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you love the game of baseball and the unique dynamics that comes with the business of sports.</p>
<p><i>Star-Studded</i> is a non-fiction book that speaks to casual fans and super fans who are looking at intense analysis and abstract concepts in baseball for the first time.</p>
<h2>The Book - <i>Star-Studded</i>
</h2>The book is written in seven parts.<br/><br/>The Introduction contains a little about why I wanted to write about this topic and also why I chose to focus a lot on the game of baseball. You’ll learn here a little about my background and why I find myself writing this book specifically. I hope to portray my passion and curiosity that has brought me to embark on this journey.<br/><br/>Part 0 contains a background on the history of data in baseball and the growth of contracts in the sport. This is meant to provide a little bit of precedence for why things are the way they are currently. You will be able to see here how these trends have impacted a sport that has been around as long as baseball has and how transformative they’ve been to the landscape of player evaluation. Some topics to be covered here are the increase of annual player salaries over time, and also the unconventional systems of management that have found success and mainstream popularity.<br/><br/>Part 1 contains pieces tailored to the perspective of fans. Here the reader can take a step back and realize what the audience of sports tends to favor in ballplayers. Being the consumer of sports makes their motivations extremely important for consideration, as they tend to be the driving force in building a player’s superstar status. Some topics to be covered here are different personalities and personal experiences affecting how fans react to certain athletes.<br/><br/>Part 2 contains pieces tailored to the perspective of teammates. Those that spend the most time with potential superstars are very important to the reputation and overall perception of those players. They can either help or hinder one’s journey to the pinnacle of fame, depending on the relationships present. Some topics to be covered here are players being a young, yet mature presence and knowing their role on the team.<br/><br/>Part 3 contains pieces tailored to the perspective of the media. They project messages to get the fans, their audience, to show interest in the player and the sport. Because of this, readers will be able to discover how individuals can be tailored to fit an outlet’s agenda and have their reputation enforced or destroyed in the process. Some topics to be covered here are what we define as greatness and the idea of Superhero Syndrome affecting how we view athletes as people.<br/><br/>Part 4 contains pieces tailored to the perspective of owners. The ones cutting the checks have their own plans for their franchises, and that in turn determines what kind of athletes they feel best accomplishes their goals and satisfies their motivations. Readers should be able to learn how the bosses think and make decisions from this part of the book. Some topics to be covered here are how time has changed business practices in sports and the importance of what I like to call the Three Rs of a successful franchise, and how exactly these things affect the determining of marquee players.<br/><br/>Part 5 contains pieces tailored to the perspective of management. They sit in the middle of most other perspectives mentioned and attempt to please all parties involved in the game. In this section, we will refer back to parts already discussed and see how management balances their responsibilities accordingly. Some topics to be covered here are delivering direct results to owners and creating a versatile product to consumers.<br/><br/>Part 6 contains pieces tailored by my personal perspective on the matter. Here I pull together all that has been covered before to establish a unique take on the topics we’ve discussed up to this point. The reader should be able to draw takeaways from my thought processes and develop their own ideas on the subject matter. Some topics to be covered here are the emergence of unconventional superstars and the development of new abstract categorization models.<p> </p>

<h2>About the Author</h2> Jackson Vines is an undergraduate student at Texas A&amp;M where he is pursuing a Finance degree with minors in Economics and Sport Management, while also remaining involved in various on-campus service and social organizations.<br/><br/>I wrote this book as a way to explore my curiosity on the enigma of superstar athletes, but also to add something of value to the conversation. The sports world has always been a part of my life and I have a genuine passion to understand it and be a part of it, and this is a way I can be a part of it currently while I continue focusing on my education.<br/><br/>Outside of writing, I enjoy spending my time with family and friends, staying active physically and socially. I have many hobbies and interests I like to pursue when my time allows for it, like golfing or music. I value my faith in God above all else and try to live a life reflective of that.<br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Jackson at vinesjackson@yahoo.com and on Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter (@JacksonVines_), and Instagram (@jackson_vines).<p> </p>

</div></div>","Story of My Book
My name is Jackson Vines and I am the author of Star-Studded. I wrote this book because I am passionate about sports, baseball specifically, and I want to contribute to the development of the game any way I can. This book has given me an avenue to give my input on the changes we are seeing in the sports world today, such as how we evaluate and value athletes at the highest level of competition.The world of sports has a small group of individuals who dominate the game they play and our attention, but the way these superstars come about and how we categorize them as such can be explained in a number of ways. This book sheds light on various perspectives of what value top-tier players generate for their teams, as well as the impact they make in and out of the industry.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover a new perspective or way of thinking about how we view elite talent and how we affect their journey to stardom. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for the changing landscape of baseball player evaluation in you. Ultimately I want you to use this book to adopt a process of determining what you consider to be a superstar ballplayer by expanding your mindset and discovering what you value in an athlete.In this book, you'll learn what people outside the sport consider superstar material and what kind of player those inside the sport are currently marketing as superstars. Some examples both parties are valuing currently are:

Personality - using charisma as a selling point to fans
Youth - bringing a new energy to the game and keeping up with the modern world
Diversity - finding unique backgrounds and stories to tell

You will love this book if you love the game of baseball and the unique dynamics that comes with the business of sports.
Star-Studded is a non-fiction book that speaks to casual fans and super fans who are looking at intense analysis and abstract concepts in baseball for the first time.
The Book - Star-Studded
The book is written in seven parts.The Introduction contains a little about why I wanted to write about this topic and also why I chose to focus a lot on the game of baseball. You’ll learn here a little about my background and why I find myself writing this book specifically. I hope to portray my passion and curiosity that has brought me to embark on this journey.Part 0 contains a background on the history of data in baseball and the growth of contracts in the sport. This is meant to provide a little bit of precedence for why things are the way they are currently. You will be able to see here how these trends have impacted a sport that has been around as long as baseball has and how transformative they’ve been to the landscape of player evaluation. Some topics to be covered here are the increase of annual player salaries over time, and also the unconventional systems of management that have found success and mainstream popularity.Part 1 contains pieces tailored to the perspective of fans. Here the reader can take a step back and realize what the audience of sports tends to favor in ballplayers. Being the consumer of sports makes their motivations extremely important for consideration, as they tend to be the driving force in building a player’s superstar status. Some topics to be covered here are different personalities and personal experiences affecting how fans react to certain athletes.Part 2 contains pieces tailored to the perspective of teammates. Those that spend the most time with potential superstars are very important to the reputation and overall perception of those players. They can either help or hinder one’s journey to the pinnacle of fame, depending on the relationships present. Some topics to be covered here are players being a young, yet mature presence and knowing their role on the team.Part 3 contains pieces tailored to the perspective of the media. They project messages to get the fans, their audience, to show interest in the player and the sport. Because of this, readers will be able to discover how individuals can be tailored to fit an outlet’s agenda and have their reputation enforced or destroyed in the process. Some topics to be covered here are what we define as greatness and the idea of Superhero Syndrome affecting how we view athletes as people.Part 4 contains pieces tailored to the perspective of owners. The ones cutting the checks have their own plans for their franchises, and that in turn determines what kind of athletes they feel best accomplishes their goals and satisfies their motivations. Readers should be able to learn how the bosses think and make decisions from this part of the book. Some topics to be covered here are how time has changed business practices in sports and the importance of what I like to call the Three Rs of a successful franchise, and how exactly these things affect the determining of marquee players.Part 5 contains pieces tailored to the perspective of management. They sit in the middle of most other perspectives mentioned and attempt to please all parties involved in the game. In this section, we will refer back to parts already discussed and see how management balances their responsibilities accordingly. Some topics to be covered here are delivering direct results to owners and creating a versatile product to consumers.Part 6 contains pieces tailored by my personal perspective on the matter. Here I pull together all that has been covered before to establish a unique take on the topics we’ve discussed up to this point. The reader should be able to draw takeaways from my thought processes and develop their own ideas on the subject matter. Some topics to be covered here are the emergence of unconventional superstars and the development of new abstract categorization models.

About the Author Jackson Vines is an undergraduate student at Texas A&M where he is pursuing a Finance degree with minors in Economics and Sport Management, while also remaining involved in various on-campus service and social organizations.I wrote this book as a way to explore my curiosity on the enigma of superstar athletes, but also to add something of value to the conversation. The sports world has always been a part of my life and I have a genuine passion to understand it and be a part of it, and this is a way I can be a part of it currently while I continue focusing on my education.Outside of writing, I enjoy spending my time with family and friends, staying active physically and socially. I have many hobbies and interests I like to pursue when my time allows for it, like golfing or music. I value my faith in God above all else and try to live a life reflective of that.For more information, you can connect with Jackson at vinesjackson@yahoo.com and on Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter (@JacksonVines_), and Instagram (@jackson_vines).

 WHAT'S MY NAME? The Calendar 2015
The Story of the Calendar
The Mission
To reach out to the family and friend unit and share the truths of the Bible, opening 
the door through the vehicle of games, so we can reconnect with God. 
To encourage Bible reading and an appreciation for all the contributing
 characters in the greatest story ever told.
 The Overview
What's My Name? - The Bible Game,  a product of Gospel Games Network,
was created by Karen Hodge for her grandchildren during their morning commute to school. 
She developed a technique to help them learn about the people in the Bible in a fun way. 
They loved it and her granddaughter, Sydnii said  ""Gran, you should make this into a game for other people to play.”
The rest is history in the making. 
That concept grew out of a verbal trivia based game... to a card game ...and two board games ...then a Blog ...a Facebook Q&A game with daily posts ...a  twice annual international competition -WMN Summer and Winter Olympic Games ...a Book, “What’s My Name? - Vignettes of Seventy Incredible Bible Characters” ...and now  the release of“What’s My Name? -The Calendar (2015)”
We've taken What's My Name? all around and introduced it at  Bible studies, house parties, family get-togethers, picnics, on road trips and the like and it's never failed to entertain!
The Aim
The aim of What's My Name? is to introduce the people in the Scriptures in a relevant, modern, entertaining way. The reality is that we've made the process exciting and fun.
Our objective is to use games to help others cultivate a relationship with God.  We want to encourage people to pick up their Bibles and explore history from a different perspective and learn that the stories of the Bible aren't fables, but rather important object lessons centered around the very real people they showcase. 
This is our ministry and our passion to reach the masses, bring family and friends back together, all through incorporating games.

</p><p>I love sea holidays, bathing, the warm sand, the light wind refreshing you before a cruel heat, tanning…On the other hand, I hate the beach crowds, noisy people, the ones playing with the ball and dumping tons of sand on your head while you are trying to catch the best sunrays. The same people wetting you while they get out of the sea. Not to mention those who step on you when you have finally found the chance to sleep…Do you know what I mean?<br/><br/><br/><b>Sometimes, chaos solves everything...</b><br/><br/>One day, on a marvellous deserted beach of the French Caribbean, while I was preparing to lie on my towel, I observed, a horde of children arriving to my small paradise, howling, gesticulating, balls, shovels and pots in their hands. In a couple of minutes, I was surrounded from all sides by these adorable kids, who came there, just like me, to enjoy the pleasure offered by the beach. <br/><br/>I also love kids, especially when they are resting…but on the beach, they are a real pain in the ass!<br/><br/>I tried as well as I could to distance myself, to isolate myself from them, but the beach was too small and their energy, too high.<br/><br/>Ten minutes later, I finally surrendered; I picked up my briefcase and went elsewhere to see if there wasn’t any other quiet corner to find. <br/><br/>Along the sea, I walked into a small fishing harbour which housed some of the most Spartan-like boats. It was at that moment when I saw it: alone, moored at the end of the harbour, abandoned from all. It was a raft made from bamboo sticks connected by a rope. It was a really normal boat, which just had to float. It had a wooden crate fixed on the platform, used with no doubt, to store small gear. <br/><br/>I looked all around me and discovered that I was alone; I instantly laid myself on the top. The place was isolated and extremely quiet. The only thing disturbing my silence was the cry of the seagulls in the sky…<br/><br/>Obviously, it wasn’t very comfortable but that peacefulness, that serenity of lying alone over the water, cradled by the gentle waves of the sea…From time to time, a bolder wave was smashing against the bamboo, spraying me with refreshing salt water. <br/><br/>I was quite peaceful, without giving a fuck/without any worries, as we say. <br/><br/>When my skin started to burn, I only had to lay myself down by the water to extinguish the blaze and once the burning feeling was gone, I went back to my frail boat. Only a few inches of water, I couldn’t risk drowning myself! Especially since I can’t swim!...Yeah!<br/>Holding my fingers crossed behind my neck I watched the sky, breathing the air of the sea in my lungs, enjoying the moment. <br/><br/>That was the moment it came like a flash… it crossed my brain in a split of a second and appeared clearly in front of my eyes. The idea…the good idea…building rafts for sunbathing. <br/><br/>This is not such a lazy idea, right? Yes, I admit it; I tend not to use my body more than necessary. But when an idea seems great to me, grinding my gears, I am ready to move mountains. <br/><br/>Then I started to think about what could look like those rafts. The ones on which I was daydreaming, were too uncomfortable. <br/><br/>Obviously, I immediately made the connection with an inflatable mattress. Indeed, we can use it to tan in the sea. Therefore, I thought, this idea is not so new. I remembered an incident that happened to me long ago, while enjoying a holiday in the Mediterranean…<br/><br/>That day, I had my plastic mattress properly inflated and I was lying on top, on a place where I was walking. I don’t know about you, but I fall asleep quickly. Let’s say that as soon as I closed my eyes, I already started travelling. Speaking of trips, I made a beautiful one…When I opened my eyes, awakened by the noise of the patrol boat’s engine; I realized I drifted away several miles from the beach. Without the aid of the guards, I would have probably made a small world tour.<br/><br/>I never repeated the experience…</p><p><br/>Another problem with the inflatable mattress is when you want to change the position, in this situation, you can quickly capsize. Hence the idea of rigid, floating platforms, large enough for you to be able to lie on them alone or in pair, firmly anchored in the sand for not waking up on the other side of the ocean. The advantage is tanning safely while being pleasantly cradled and comforted by a soft overlay.<br/><br/>In remembrance of this idyllic time, I gave the name, Raft-Tan to the beach companion: The Raft Tanner. <br/><br/><br/></p>

Now, it is necessary to talk about money. Making a scale prototype, test situations, filing patents cost no less than 150.000 $.<br/><br/>Wow, not cheap at all! Tranquillity and comfort have a price, that’s for sure.<br/><br/>But, but…how many Raft-Tan can be issued from factories? Our beautiful planet abounds of beautiful paradise beaches and spacious water places in many countries. <br/><br/>Just as the pedal boats conquered the world, Raft-Tan can encounter a great success as well.<br/><br/><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/756901/files/20140731093633-Raft-tan5.jpg?1406824593"" src="""" style=""""/></p><b>The market is huge and so are my needs…</b><br/><br/>On our own, we cannot do anything, only arouse our fantasies. This is reason why I created a strong team to develop this project. Nautical experts, confirmed traders, boys and girls with a strong skill to achieve this challenge. <br/><br/>But most of all, I need YOU, the one who is about to read me. Because without you, my Guadeloupe-like raft will forever remain a nice, simple holiday memory…I personally want to be confident, and I want you to be confident enough as well in order for you to offer some money from your pocket or your sock. <br/><br/>If you also want to tan, resting peacefully on the water, without getting sand in your eyes, without handling the promiscuity of a crowded beach, without any person to stumble upon you, if you want to stand out from the crowd, out of the herd, in an original way, then join me, join us. Together we will build a beautiful story, our common story. The story of Raft-Tan!<br/><p></p><p></p><p><br/></p><p>                           <br/></p><p></p>I could have written this story in France, but here, you see, we are a little bit cold. Our beautiful country doesn’t like entrepreneurs. That’s why I am calling all the world’s citizens. Because I know that you, the ones living in other environments, you have the entrepreneurial spirit, you have the sense; you know how to detect a good business, but most of all, you always want to dream and you know that among us, most people are not dreaming…<br/><div>

                    Oui la plage peut être dangereuse, mais il y a une solution…</em></p>

<p>
                    J’adore les vacances à la mer, les baignades, le sable chaud, le petit alizé qui 
                    vient vous rafraichir avant d’avoir trop chaud, me bronzer au soleil…Par contre, 
                    je déteste la promiscuité sur la plage, les gens bruyant, ceux qui jouent au 
                    ballon et vous déversent des tonnes de sable sur la tête pendant que vous tentez 
                    de capter les meilleurs rayons de soleil. Ceux encore qui vous aspergent d’eau 
                    en sortant de la mer. Sans oublier ceux qui vous marchent dessus alors que vous 
                    aviez, enfin, trouvé le sommeil…Vous voyez ce que je veux dire ?</p>
<p>
<strong>Quelque fois le hasard fait bien les choses…</strong></p>
<p>
                    Un jour, sur une merveilleuse plage désertique des caraïbes 
                    française, et alors que je m’apprêtais à m’allonger sur ma serviette, je vis 
                    arriver sur mon petit paradis, une horde d’enfants, hurlant, gesticulant, 
                    ballons, pelles et pots en main. En quelques minutes, j’étais cerné de toutes 
                    parts par ces adorables bambins qui venaient là, pour, comme moi, gouter aux 
                    joies de la plage…</p>
<p>
                    J’adore aussi les enfants, surtout quand ils sont à la sieste…mais sur la plage, 
                    c’est un enfer !</p>
<p>
                    J’ai tenté tant bien que mal de me mettre à l’écart, de m’isoler, mais la plage 
                    était petite, et leur énergie était grande.</p>
<p>
                    Au bout de dix minutes j’ai fini par rendre les armes, j’ai ramassé ma serviette 
                    et je suis parti voir ailleurs s’il n’y avait pas un coin plus tranquille.</p>
<p>
                    En longeant la mer, j’ai pris la direction d’un minuscule port de pèche, qui 
                    abritait quelques embarcations des plus spartiates. C’est à ce moment là que je 
                    l’ai aperçu, seul, amarré au bout du port, semblant abandonné de tous. C’était 
                    un radeau fait de bambous, assemblés par un cordage. Une embarcation très 
                    sommaire, qui devait tout juste flotter. Sur la plateforme, il y avait, fixée, 
                    une caisse en bois qui devait, sans doute, servir à ranger du petit matériel de 
                    pêche.</p>
<p>
                    J’ai regardé tout autour de moi et constatant qu’il n’y avait personne, je m’y 
                    suis allongé dessus. L’endroit était isolé et particulièrement silencieux. Seul 
                    le cri des mouettes dans le ciel, venait troubler le merveilleux silence…</p>
<p>
                    Ce n’était, certes, pas très confortable, mais quelle tranquillité, quelle 
                    sérénité, d’être ainsi, allongé, seul, au dessus de l’eau, bercé par le doux 
                    roulis de la mer. De temps en temps, une petite vague plus audacieuse que les 
                    autres, venait se fracasser sur les bambous et m’aspergeait d’eau salée très 
                    rafraichissante.</p>
<p>
                    J’étais bien, paisible, décontracté du gland, comme on dit chez nous (mais ça, 
                    il ne faut pas le dire, c’est un peu vulgaire)</p>
<p>
                    Quand ma peau commençait à frire, je n’avais qu’à me laisser glisser dans l’eau, 
                    pour éteindre le brasier, puis je remontais sur ma fragile embarcation, une fois 
                    le feu éteint. Il y avait juste quelques centimètres d’eau, je ne risquais pas 
                    de me noyer. Surtout que je ne sais pas nager…Ben oui !</p>
<p>
                    Les doigts croisés derrière ma nuque, je contemplais le ciel, humant l’air marin 
                    à plein poumons, savourant l’instant.</p>
<p>
                    C’est alors qu’elle est arrivée, tel un éclair, en une fraction de secondes elle 
                    a traversé mon cerveau pour m’apparaitre, limpide, devant les yeux. L’idée, la 
                    bonne idée…Construire des radeaux pour bronzer.</p>
<p>
                    C’est pas une idée de fainéant ça ? Oui, j’avoue, j’ai tendance à ne pas user 
                    mon organisme, plus qu’il ne faut. Mais quand une idée, qui me semble géniale, 
                    me triture les neurones, je suis prêt à soulever des montagnes.</p>
<p>
                    J’ai commencé alors à réfléchir à quoi pourrait ressembler ces radeaux. Celui 
                    sur lequel je rêvassais, étant bien trop inconfortable.</p>
<p>
                    Bien entendu, j’ai aussitôt fait le parallèle avec un matelas gonflable. On 
                    peut, en effet, bronzer en mer avec. Donc, pensais-je, cette fumeuse idée n’est 
                    pas si nouvelle que cela. Puis je me suis souvenu d’une mésaventure qu’il m’est 
                    arrivé il y a bien longtemps, lors de vacances en méditerranée…</p>
<p>
                    Ce jour là, j’avais bien gonflé mon matelas plastique et je m’étais allongé 
                    dessus, à un endroit où j’avais pied. Je ne sais pas vous, mais moi je m’endors 
                    rapidement. Disons que sitôt les yeux fermés, je voyage déjà. En parlant de 
                    balade, j’en ai fait une belle… Quand j’ai ouvert les yeux, réveillé par le 
                    bruit du moteur de la vedette de la police nationale, j’ai pu constater que 
                    j’avais dérivé à plusieurs kilomètres de la plage. Sans le secours des gardes 
                    cotes, j’aurais peut être fait mon petit tour du monde.</p>
<p>
<strong>Je n’ai jamais renouvelé l’expérience…</strong></p>
<p>
                    Il y a un autre problème avec le matelas gonflable, en voulant changer de 
                    position, on peut très vite chavirer. D’où l’idée de plates formes flottantes, 
                    rigides, assez grande pour pouvoir s’allonger seul ou à deux, solidement 
                    amarrées au sol, pour ne pas se réveiller de l’autre coté  de l’océan. 
                    L’avantage est de pouvoir bronzer en toute sécurité tout en étant agréablement 
                    bercé et confortablement installé grâce à un revêtement moelleux.</p>
<p>
                    En souvenir de ce moment idyllique, j’ai donné le nom de, Raft-Tan à ce 
                    compagnon de plage : Le radeau à bronzer.</p>
<p>Voila pour la petite histoire...</p>
<p>Maintenant il faut parler argent. Réaliser un prototype grandeur nature, faire des essais en situation, déposer des brevets, coûtent pas moins de 150 000$.</p>

</div></div>","I love sea holidays, bathing, the warm sand, the light wind refreshing you before a cruel heat, tanning…On the other hand, I hate the beach crowds, noisy people, the ones playing with the ball and dumping tons of sand on your head while you are trying to catch the best sunrays. The same people wetting you while they get out of the sea. Not to mention those who step on you when you have finally found the chance to sleep…Do you know what I mean?Sometimes, chaos solves everything...One day, on a marvellous deserted beach of the French Caribbean, while I was preparing to lie on my towel, I observed, a horde of children arriving to my small paradise, howling, gesticulating, balls, shovels and pots in their hands. In a couple of minutes, I was surrounded from all sides by these adorable kids, who came there, just like me, to enjoy the pleasure offered by the beach. I also love kids, especially when they are resting…but on the beach, they are a real pain in the ass!I tried as well as I could to distance myself, to isolate myself from them, but the beach was too small and their energy, too high.Ten minutes later, I finally surrendered; I picked up my briefcase and went elsewhere to see if there wasn’t any other quiet corner to find. Along the sea, I walked into a small fishing harbour which housed some of the most Spartan-like boats. It was at that moment when I saw it: alone, moored at the end of the harbour, abandoned from all. It was a raft made from bamboo sticks connected by a rope. It was a really normal boat, which just had to float. It had a wooden crate fixed on the platform, used with no doubt, to store small gear. I looked all around me and discovered that I was alone; I instantly laid myself on the top. The place was isolated and extremely quiet. The only thing disturbing my silence was the cry of the seagulls in the sky…Obviously, it wasn’t very comfortable but that peacefulness, that serenity of lying alone over the water, cradled by the gentle waves of the sea…From time to time, a bolder wave was smashing against the bamboo, spraying me with refreshing salt water. I was quite peaceful, without giving a fuck/without any worries, as we say. When my skin started to burn, I only had to lay myself down by the water to extinguish the blaze and once the burning feeling was gone, I went back to my frail boat. Only a few inches of water, I couldn’t risk drowning myself! Especially since I can’t swim!...Yeah!Holding my fingers crossed behind my neck I watched the sky, breathing the air of the sea in my lungs, enjoying the moment. That was the moment it came like a flash… it crossed my brain in a split of a second and appeared clearly in front of my eyes. The idea…the good idea…building rafts for sunbathing. This is not such a lazy idea, right? Yes, I admit it; I tend not to use my body more than necessary. But when an idea seems great to me, grinding my gears, I am ready to move mountains. Then I started to think about what could look like those rafts. The ones on which I was daydreaming, were too uncomfortable. Obviously, I immediately made the connection with an inflatable mattress. Indeed, we can use it to tan in the sea. Therefore, I thought, this idea is not so new. I remembered an incident that happened to me long ago, while enjoying a holiday in the Mediterranean…That day, I had my plastic mattress properly inflated and I was lying on top, on a place where I was walking. I don’t know about you, but I fall asleep quickly. Let’s say that as soon as I closed my eyes, I already started travelling. Speaking of trips, I made a beautiful one…When I opened my eyes, awakened by the noise of the patrol boat’s engine; I realized I drifted away several miles from the beach. Without the aid of the guards, I would have probably made a small world tour.I never repeated the experience…Another problem with the inflatable mattress is when you want to change the position, in this situation, you can quickly capsize. Hence the idea of rigid, floating platforms, large enough for you to be able to lie on them alone or in pair, firmly anchored in the sand for not waking up on the other side of the ocean. The advantage is tanning safely while being pleasantly cradled and comforted by a soft overlay.In remembrance of this idyllic time, I gave the name, Raft-Tan to the beach companion: The Raft Tanner. 
That was the story. Now, it is necessary to talk about money. Making a scale prototype, test situations, filing patents cost no less than 150.000 $.Wow, not cheap at all! Tranquillity and comfort have a price, that’s for sure.But, but…how many Raft-Tan can be issued from factories? Our beautiful planet abounds of beautiful paradise beaches and spacious water places in many countries. Just as the pedal boats conquered the world, Raft-Tan can encounter a great success as well.The market is huge and so are my needs…On our own, we cannot do anything, only arouse our fantasies. This is reason why I created a strong team to develop this project. Nautical experts, confirmed traders, boys and girls with a strong skill to achieve this challenge. But most of all, I need YOU, the one who is about to read me. Because without you, my Guadeloupe-like raft will forever remain a nice, simple holiday memory…I personally want to be confident, and I want you to be confident enough as well in order for you to offer some money from your pocket or your sock. If you also want to tan, resting peacefully on the water, without getting sand in your eyes, without handling the promiscuity of a crowded beach, without any person to stumble upon you, if you want to stand out from the crowd, out of the herd, in an original way, then join me, join us. Together we will build a beautiful story, our common story. The story of Raft-Tan!                           I could have written this story in France, but here, you see, we are a little bit cold. Our beautiful country doesn’t like entrepreneurs. That’s why I am calling all the world’s citizens. Because I know that you, the ones living in other environments, you have the entrepreneurial spirit, you have the sense; you know how to detect a good business, but most of all, you always want to dream and you know that among us, most people are not dreaming…

                    Oui la plage peut être dangereuse, mais il y a une solution…


                    J’adore les vacances à la mer, les baignades, le sable chaud, le petit alizé qui 
                    vient vous rafraichir avant d’avoir trop chaud, me bronzer au soleil…Par contre, 
                    je déteste la promiscuité sur la plage, les gens bruyant, ceux qui jouent au 
                    ballon et vous déversent des tonnes de sable sur la tête pendant que vous tentez 
                    de capter les meilleurs rayons de soleil. Ceux encore qui vous aspergent d’eau 
                    en sortant de la mer. Sans oublier ceux qui vous marchent dessus alors que vous 
                    aviez, enfin, trouvé le sommeil…Vous voyez ce que je veux dire ?

Quelque fois le hasard fait bien les choses…

                    Un jour, sur une merveilleuse plage désertique des caraïbes 
                    française, et alors que je m’apprêtais à m’allonger sur ma serviette, je vis 
                    arriver sur mon petit paradis, une horde d’enfants, hurlant, gesticulant, 
                    ballons, pelles et pots en main. En quelques minutes, j’étais cerné de toutes 
                    parts par ces adorables bambins qui venaient là, pour, comme moi, gouter aux 
                    joies de la plage…

                    J’adore aussi les enfants, surtout quand ils sont à la sieste…mais sur la plage, 
                    c’est un enfer !

                    J’ai tenté tant bien que mal de me mettre à l’écart, de m’isoler, mais la plage 
                    était petite, et leur énergie était grande.

                    Au bout de dix minutes j’ai fini par rendre les armes, j’ai ramassé ma serviette 
                    et je suis parti voir ailleurs s’il n’y avait pas un coin plus tranquille.

                    En longeant la mer, j’ai pris la direction d’un minuscule port de pèche, qui 
                    abritait quelques embarcations des plus spartiates. C’est à ce moment là que je 
                    l’ai aperçu, seul, amarré au bout du port, semblant abandonné de tous. C’était 
                    un radeau fait de bambous, assemblés par un cordage. Une embarcation très 
                    sommaire, qui devait tout juste flotter. Sur la plateforme, il y avait, fixée, 
                    une caisse en bois qui devait, sans doute, servir à ranger du petit matériel de 
                    pêche.

                    J’ai regardé tout autour de moi et constatant qu’il n’y avait personne, je m’y 
                    suis allongé dessus. L’endroit était isolé et particulièrement silencieux. Seul 
                    le cri des mouettes dans le ciel, venait troubler le merveilleux silence…

                    Ce n’était, certes, pas très confortable, mais quelle tranquillité, quelle 
                    sérénité, d’être ainsi, allongé, seul, au dessus de l’eau, bercé par le doux 
                    roulis de la mer. De temps en temps, une petite vague plus audacieuse que les 
                    autres, venait se fracasser sur les bambous et m’aspergeait d’eau salée très

<p>I am a Writing Instructor that doesn't get much time to write. This is my chance to develop my writing habits and prepare myself for a PhD program in the not-too-distant future.</p>
<h3>What's Needed</h3>
<p>The cost of the flight to Austin, TX from D.C. Unfortunately, the flights are already almost $400. As an adjunct, my finances are already tight. However, this is an important opportunity for growth that is worth the investment in my career and personal/professional development.</p>
<ul>
<li>I only need funding for the airfare--Ire'ne has granted me a scholarship for the cost of the retreat!</li>
<li>Even if I can't get the entire $400 for the flight, anything you can contribute will get me there.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Information about Ire'ne's retreat</h3>
<p>November 11-12, 2017 (12 noon Saturday-3pm Sunday):</p>
<p>Building a Writing Life: Getting Out of Our Own Way. Are you a writer struggling to create or maintain a writing life while also living life-life (job, family, self-care)? Are you a self-taught writer or a writer years out of an MFA program trying to map a road for yourself through a writing project? This weekend retreat is focused on various issues that I see come up again and again in workshops but that are never the prime focus: How do we handle our time and energy resources to write? How do we take care of ourselves while writing? What is our relation to ‘a writing life’ or to the label of ‘writer’?

I am a Writing Instructor that doesn't get much time to write. This is my chance to develop my writing habits and prepare myself for a PhD program in the not-too-distant future.
What's Needed
The cost of the flight to Austin, TX from D.C. Unfortunately, the flights are already almost $400. As an adjunct, my finances are already tight. However, this is an important opportunity for growth that is worth the investment in my career and personal/professional development.

I only need funding for the airfare--Ire'ne has granted me a scholarship for the cost of the retreat!
Even if I can't get the entire $400 for the flight, anything you can contribute will get me there.

Information about Ire'ne's retreat
November 11-12, 2017 (12 noon Saturday-3pm Sunday):
Building a Writing Life: Getting Out of Our Own Way. Are you a writer struggling to create or maintain a writing life while also living life-life (job, family, self-care)? Are you a self-taught writer or a writer years out of an MFA program trying to map a road for yourself through a writing project? This weekend retreat is focused on various issues that I see come up again and again in workshops but that are never the prime focus: How do we handle our time and energy resources to write? How do we take care of ourselves while writing? What is our relation to ‘a writing life’ or to the label of ‘writer’? What are successful strategies that are helping us move forward–and how are we getting in our own way? Along with writing exercise, we will have plenty of time to discuss all these issues and help ourselves as we help each other. Price $225 with overnight accommodations/$175 without.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Knowing is a book about navigating everyday life while also navigating mental health issues. It follows the protagonist, Harper, and her journey coping with PTSD. <br/><br/>My name is, Valerie Lane, and I am the author of The Knowing. I wrote this book because mental health issues are affecting all of us in 2020. I want readers to turn the pages of this book and connect with someone who is also struggling to cope with an overwhelming amount of stress.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover it’s okay to not be okay. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to learn more about dealing with trauma and creating compassion for friends or family members who may be coping with trauma as well. <br/><br/>From the outside looking in, Harper’s life is perfect. She’s got the stable job, a fiancé, and a beautiful apartment with a French bull dog to post on Instagram. However, when Harper makes the difficult decision to leave her seemingly supportive partner, everything falls apart. She realizes just how toxic her fiancé had been towards her, and how much of a passive decision maker she had been in her own life. Once the reigns are back in her hands, Harper has to answer the most difficult question of all: What do I actually want? Through group therapy sessions, blossoming friendships, and the rock solid support of her best friend Brittany, Harper must come to terms with her mental health and heal from the trauma she endured. Will she succumb to the rough waters of mental illness? Or can Harper rise up and write her own story?  <br/><br/>You will love this book if you love reading stories of resilience, female friendships, or are looking to learn more about healing from trauma.<br/><br/>The Knowing speaks to those struggling with mental health issues and family members of people going through trauma who want to grapple with what they can do to help and understanding mental health in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that The Knowing inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<p>Am I an active decision maker in my own life?</p>
<p>Who do I know that may be struggling with mental health right now?</p>
<p>Can I do something to change the conversation around mental health, LGBTQ+ issues, or victim’s rights?</p>
<p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing these questions will change us all for the better. </p>

<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>Valerie Lane works at the University of Delaware in the Community Engagement Initiative. She is also a small business owner, doing social media marketing and event planning, and a yoga instructor. Identifying as a ‘Jane of all Trades,’ Valerie is excited to add 'Author' to her list of job titles with the publication of her first book. <br/><br/>Valerie has wanted to write a book since elementary school, after falling in love with Lemony Snicket’s Series of Unfortunate Events.

<p>In 2015, we rented out our home in Baltimore, Maryland, bought an RV, and set out on an Amazing Marriage Adventure. Our goal was to share married couple’s love stories from across the United States in hopes of inspiring all couples to live a more amazing life together. After over a year on the road and over 40,000 miles driven, we completed the Adventure and have documented at least one married couple’s love story in each state.</p>
<p><i>Amazing Life Together</i> is a celebration of love and compilation of 75 unforgettable love stories and inspiring quotes about marriage that couples shared with us as we traveled across the country. The book is full of impactful stories of trials and triumphs that will fill your heart with love, joy, hope, and inspiration. From the former drug dealers in inner-city Atlanta, GA, to the young farmer and his wife in Gackle, ND, to the couple battling breast cancer together in Portland, OR, to the NFL player and his wife in Chicago, IL, each couple has a unique story that will touch your heart.</p>
<p>A beautiful full-color, hard-bound book, with over 110 gorgeous color photos, <i>Amazing Life Together</i> will be an inspiring addition to your coffee table and will leave a lasting impact on you and those you share it with. Have we mentioned it would be the perfect wedding gift for those soon-to-be-married couples in your life?</p>

<h3>WHAT THIS CAMPAIGN WILL FUND</h3>
<p>After spending over a year in an RV, and then a year transcribing and compiling the love stories we documented, we are excited to complete the self-publishing process of <i>Amazing Life Together</i>. The book is written. It is in the final stages of editing. The cover is designed, and now we just need your help to print it. Our goal is to raise $10,000 to print the first set of books. </p>

<p>Through this self-publishing process, we have learned there are quite a few benefits to self-publishing over traditional publishing. However, there are just a few challenges, as well. One of the challenges is the cost of printing. Without having access to the scale of print jobs that traditional publishers have, the cost to print each book is extremely high. We have decided to create this book as a hard-bound, premium full-color book, because we want this to be something you are excited to have on your coffee table, today and everyday! It is meant to be something that can inspire you with love for years to come. By choosing a high quality product, we are forced to price the book at $50, which we understand might be higher than what you would typically spend on a book. However, we hope you see the value, as we do, in the quality product and mission surrounding it.</p>
<p>Purchasing your <i>Amazing Life Together</i> book through this pre-sale is monumental in getting this book into the hands of many. By purchasing our first round of books, we will be able to secure a slight discount on the bulk order. <strong>All proceeds from the sales of these books and donations from this campaign, will go directly to Amazing Life Together, funding the completion of this project, and allowing the organization to continue to document and share inspiring love stories in the future.  </strong></p>

<h3>THE IMPACT</h3>
<p>As wedding photographers, we've seen how much energy and excitement goes into planning a wedding. However, after photographing over 125 weddings, we realized that there is so much hype surrounding a wedding day, but not the marriage afterwards. Our hope is that this book will be a beautiful reminder of the inspiring love that surrounds us and the gift that is marriage.</p>
<h3><strong>WHAT COUPLES ARE SAYING</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Joni &amp; Tory - Maine</strong> - “Just talking about us like that, and really having to dig deep for your answers was so good for us! It was a total refresh having to really think about how our relationship works. We’ve been on cloud nine all weekend and I feel like it’s totally been so affirming for the little team that we’ve become. So thank YOU guys for the reminder of the treasure that we have in one another.”</p>
<p><strong>Amanda &amp; Tyler - New Hampshire -</strong> “Thank you! Thank you! Thank you for yesterday! You really made our day, week, year. It was truly refreshing to meet a couple that shares a lot of our views on marriage. Thank you for what you are doing. I believe that the adventure you are taking is going to help a lot of couples. You have already made us fall a little more in love!</p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>Lindsay &amp; Keli'i - Hawaii</strong> - “We enjoyed doing the interview with you and had a lot of fun with it! We felt that it was quite beneficial for us just to take the time to reminisce and talk about things that are important to us. Thank you so much for that! I wish you the very best in this project, I think it’s wonderful!”</p>

</div></div>","In 2015, we rented out our home in Baltimore, Maryland, bought an RV, and set out on an Amazing Marriage Adventure. Our goal was to share married couple’s love stories from across the United States in hopes of inspiring all couples to live a more amazing life together. After over a year on the road and over 40,000 miles driven, we completed the Adventure and have documented at least one married couple’s love story in each state.
Amazing Life Together is a celebration of love and compilation of 75 unforgettable love stories and inspiring quotes about marriage that couples shared with us as we traveled across the country. The book is full of impactful stories of trials and triumphs that will fill your heart with love, joy, hope, and inspiration. From the former drug dealers in inner-city Atlanta, GA, to the young farmer and his wife in Gackle, ND, to the couple battling breast cancer together in Portland, OR, to the NFL player and his wife in Chicago, IL, each couple has a unique story that will touch your heart.
A beautiful full-color, hard-bound book, with over 110 gorgeous color photos, Amazing Life Together will be an inspiring addition to your coffee table and will leave a lasting impact on you and those you share it with. Have we mentioned it would be the perfect wedding gift for those soon-to-be-married couples in your life?
A SNEAK PEAK OF THE INCREDIBLE COUPLES INSIDE AMAZING LIFE TOGETHER 



Jen and Ryan - Brooksville, FL
""Marriage is hard but really good. We have learned that it is important to be creative with how things can look. It is not always black or white. We are really good at seeing other ways to do things that are not expected or normal. It has given us opportunities to grow in different ways. We have fun outside of the norm.""


 



Siggi and Martellus - Chicago, IL
""My whole goal is to be the man that I would want my daughter to marry. Whether it’s as a father or the way I treat her mom. I want my daughter to see how much fun you can have in a relationship. I want her to grow up in an environment where we have breakfast for dinner or dessert before dinner.""

<p>The Living Writers Series is a program created for the enrichment and enjoyment of the high school literary experience. Professor Hiram Sims had a profound epiphany in his fiction writing class at Compton College. He assigned a novel called Butterfly Jar, written by Jalondra Davis. It's a coming-of-age story where the main character, Stacey, struggles to rationalize the realities of her South Central home while living through the LA Riots. These students had never studied a novel that took place in their own city that reflected the relevancy of their own culture and location. On the day that they turned in their final essay, Jalondra Davis walked through the door. They could not believe it! Not one of the students, who ranged from ages 18 to 65, had ever met an author. Nor could they believe that someone from their own neighborhood could write a book worthy of being studied in a classroom. In awe and disbelief, they asked her questions, read excerpts from their essays, took pictures with her, and had her sign their books. Professor Sims knew that this was an experience that every writing student deserved.​</p>
<p>As Professor Sims began to examine the curriculum taught at local high schools, he recognized the same disturbing pattern in countless American English classrooms - all of the writers were dead! The absence of the living writer in the classroom often made the reading of poetry and fiction in the public school system in some ways lifeless. In addition, several Los Angeles schools were void of literature that reflected their culture and community. So, the Living Writers Series (LWS) was created to fill this void and bring living Los Angeles poets and storytellers into the classroom. Once a month, Los Angeles writers who have published books visit LAUSD classrooms, and perform their works for students. The readings are traditionally followed by book signings where interested students are given a free copy of the author’s work.</p>
<p>The opportunity to meet the same person that stirred your soul through print is so rare and has created such a palpable sense of excitement that the Living Writers Series expanded from one classroom to four high schools in just a few years. Stakeholders at all levels have been reaching out requesting programming to be available at their home site. However, it takes quite a bit of passion, effort and hours to adequately do the program justice and that's where we would love your support.​</p>
<p>By donating, you can increase the presence of the Living Writers Series. Proceeds, in part, will be used to acquire books that will be available to a local high school student forever! Every year, your donation will go to a new student at Foshay Learning Center, View Park High School, King Drew High School, Fairfax High School, and many others.​</p>
<p>In recognition of your support, you will receive a monthly newsletter detailing the amazing work going on in countless Los Angeles classrooms because of your donation. You will also receive exclusive footage of our monthly performances in the classroom.  Please support either through donation, volunteering or spreading the word to prevent dreams from going deferred.</p>

<p>Over the last several months, the UCLA Art | Sci Center has partnered with Building Bridges Art Exchange and the International Association of Synesthetes, Artists, and Scientists (IASAS) to produce several groundbreaking events. There has been an art exhibition full of the work of synesthetic artists, an author’s reading with synesthetic physician Dr. Joel Salinas, a wine tasting with synesthetic sommelier Jaime Smith, and a performance by synesthetic musician Kaitlyn Hova. The IASAS also organized a symposium at the UCLA Art | Sci Center which explored cutting edge research into synesthesia, with keynote speakers including Dr. Salinas, Dr. Michael Banissy, and Dr. Richard Cytowic</p>
<h2><strong>OUR MISSION</strong></h2>
<p>These events are a singular achievement, and we want to document, preserve, and share the rare knowledge and artistic production that have been created. By contributing to the production of this book, you will be part of a historical undertaking to bridge the gap between the arts and sciences through exploration of a unique condition of the brain. </p>

 had no idea what iTunes was until a friend suggested that he start

inner truth.  Soon, thousands of people started tuning in to what he had

Our StoryWe
 are shaped by our thoughts; we become what we think. When the mind is 
quiet, we experience our natural state of being, which is joy.What
 if for a moment, every thought in your mind, every worry, every fear 
become completely, utterly still and there was nothing but silence? We 
believe that quieting the constant whirring of the mind is a path toward
 much more joy in our lives. Through stillness, we can relieve 
suffering. Welcome
 to this project -- congratulate yourself for being here! This campaign 
is the first step in A Quiet Mind’s larger mission to help us all awaken
 from the needless suffering that fills our lives. Robert
 never thought he would hit the top of the charts on iTunes, actually he
 had no idea what iTunes was until a friend suggested that he start 
podcasting and teaching people how to meditate. This friend created the 
first blog and started Robert on his way, pointing people to their own 
inner truth.  Soon, thousands of people started tuning in to what he had
 to say. The podcasts, which were completely spontaneous, now began to 
serve as powerful counsel and spiritual guidance for people all over the
 country and the world.The

<p><strong>Elijah needs an Accessible Wheelchair Van</strong></p>
<p>Elijah is a 8 year old boy who is diagnosed with quadriplegic cerebral palsy. He was born at 24 weeks gestation weighing only 1lb. 8oz. He has dystonia, spasticity dependence for walking or crawling and contractures of the muscles of the legs. He is at high risk for falls or fractures. Elijah requires the use of a wheelchair with special seating modifications, and he uses a walker that is specially designed to support his body weight and that functions like and is shaped much like a wheelchair.</p>
<p>Elijah needs a special adapted wheelchair van with a lift in order to transport his walker and wheelchair to and from school, numerous doctor’s appointments, community events such as church, family gatherings and school activities and therapy appointments (OT, PT, Aquatic and Hippo) that all work together to allow him to grow new skills; however, these appointments are continuous throughout the week.</p>
<p>As Elijah continues to grow physically, so does the challenges that I his mom is faced with. His growing body becomes more difficult to lift and transfer, and his spasticity grows stronger to overcome. These factors not only complicate the functional transfers that I perform daily, but they also increase the risk of injury to Elijah himself and to his caregivers. I transfer him on a daily basis at home and for school. He is transferred countless times a week to and from his chair and in and out of the car to attend physical therapy, occupational therapy, aquatic therapy, hippotherapy, and medical appointments. Without adaptive equipment to ease the transfers, we will face the possibility of physically wearing themselves out. Elijah will continue to require physical assistance from his parents with functional transfers therefore caregiver wellness is a top priority. Limiting the amount of physical strain will not only relieve the caregivers but it will also greatly serve Elijah as he participates in school and community activities.</p>
<p>Elijah is an exceptional individual with a Great Spirit and wonderful potential.  He is one that is determined to succeed in whatever he tries to accomplish.  He doesn’t give up as he has the motivation that will take him far in his life.  He has a great sense of humor and lets no challenges block his way.  As with his determination and motivation I’m not going to give up either so with all your help we should be able to raise the funding needed to get Elijah a wheelchair accessible van that he deserves.  </p>
<p>Thank you all for taking the time to read! We need your help in making this gift to Elijah a reality.  We can do it!</p>

<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $49,195 for a accessible wheelchair van.  I'll be working with Koons Mobility Center of Annapolis, MD.  We have decided on a 2010 Honda Odyssey with modifications that will suite Elijah’s needs. We are applying for grants and I know we will receive a grant of at least $10,000 through the DDA Funding to go towards the van and we’re hoping and praying that they will approve even more up to $30,000 for a total of 40,000. So as of right now we are asking for your help in raising $5800.</p>
<p>What we can give you in return:</p>
<p>$10 dollars will get you heartfelt thanks and a shout-out on my Facebook page.</p>
<p> $25 dollars will get you heartfelt thanks, a shout-out on my Facebook page, and a signed Thank you Card from family.</p>
<p> $75 dollars will get you heartfelt thanks, a shout-out on my Facebook page, a signed Thank You card from family, one of Elijah's Handprint Keychain saying “Thanks for your helping hand”</p>
<p> $125 dollars will get you all the above and a Unique Gift Cake from Unique Gift Cakes N' More by GiGi</p>
<p> If we don't reach our entire goal, we'll put the money in savings, until we reach our goal.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Elijah's a busy guy.  He has lots of doctors' appointments, therapy appointments, and generally loves to be out in his community.  Your gift will make a huge impact on Elijah's life, allowing him to fully enjoy all that is around him. And it will also help mom out too! Your contribution makes a difference!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We get it.  We realize that not everyone can contribute financially. Here's how you can help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Talk up the cause.  Post the link to our site on your Facebook, Twitter, or other social media sites.</li>
<li>Some great folk are going to be doing some benefits for Elijah over the summer.  Come out and support!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Say a prayer for us that God may help to press upon the hearts of those who can give financially to have the will to do so.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>ALL Help is appreciated and please know that we will definitely PAY IT FORWARD!</p>
<p>Thanks so much.  If we pull this off, it will be a result of caring people who stretch themselves when times are challenging.  We love you and pray that God blesses you in many ways for reading, supporting or even considering helping us out.</p>
<p>Thanks for being a blessing as it’s always a blessing for someone else.</p>

<h3>Who I am</h3>
I am an award-winning travel writer who is currently based in Indonesia, finishing up a two-year volunteer assignment as a fundraising advisor for a maternal and child health center.</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>I have been invited to participate as a panelist in the NonFictionNow conference in Melbourne, Australia in November 2012. I need to cover my airfare ($500), four days hotel accommodation ($600) and the reduced registration fee for panelists ($200).  That's it. i'll cover my incidental costs and meals.</p>
<p>I may still be able to attend if I can cover my airfare and registration fee. I can try throwing myself on the mercy of another writer and beg to share their hotel room. Or try sleeping in Melbourne's parks. The grass is soft and the air is warm at that time of year, and the parks are pretty safe, even overnight. Just kidding. I may be able to find other accomodation, but the essential costs are the airfare and registration fee.</p>
</div>
<div>
<strong></strong>
<h3>How this will help me</h3>
<p>Attending this confernence, as a panellst, will give me the chance to meet and network with other, more established writers, as well as publishers and editors. I have successfully worked on a collaborative project before with 3 other travel writers, a travel series about women travelling solo, which won an award.</p>
<p>(see <a href=""http://www.worldhum.com/travel-blog/item/world_hum_writers_win_north_american_travel_journalists_awards_12312007/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.worldhum.com/travel-blog/item/world_hum_writers_win_north_american_travel_journalists_awards_12312007/</a>)</p>
<p>I will be looking for other collaborative projects, as well as hoping to get referrals  and possibly even commissions for writing jobs. Speaking to a live audience will be great personal development for me as well, giving me the confidence to speak to an audience of readers and gain a wider audience for my work. The exposure will be fantastic for my writing career, and may even lead to more invitations to other writer events and festivals. Fingers crossed.</p>

<p>I am a full-time teacher of English as a second language and creative
 writing. In March 2013, I graduated from Seattle Pacific University's 
MFA program in creative writing. A few months later, in response to the ongoing devastation of honeybee colonies and pollinator health due to unregulated insecticide use, I developed and launched a literary anthology called <i></i><a href=""http://wingedbook.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Winged: New Writing on Bees. </a>The book will be released at the end of October and includes writing from celebrated and up-and-coming writers from all over the country. <br/></p>
<p>My work has been published in a wide variety of magazines and literary journals, and this year I was nominated for a Pushcart Prize.

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>I need time to write, a creative jumpstart, and some key professional advice. Tupelo Press's Perfect Ten workshop gives me all three. Now I just need a little boost to help me get there. <br/></p>

<b>My goal is specific and achievable,</b> and I've proven that project-oriented writing works for me. In April 2013, I wrote 30 poems in 30 days as a fundraiser for Tupelo 
Press. With the generous support of family and friends, I not only 
exceeded my fundraising goals, but I also wrote a lot of poems! Sponsors received a handmade chapbook of all 30 poems from the project. I'm hopeful that this experience will be even more fruitful, and that I'll be sharing my published book with you in 2015.<br/>

<p>I'm ambitious, hardworking, and disciplined. I'll use the focused time of this retreat to generate new work and revise unfinished poems. I'll use the professional feedback I receive to prioritize my work going forward, and set weekly, monthly, and quarterly goals to keep myself on track.

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p><strong>VIDEOS AND IMAGES OF THE BOOK ARE IN THE GALLERY</strong></p>
<p><img alt=""Angelus Cyborg"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://eidolon.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/cyborg.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; border: 7px solid white;""/>This is a project being launched by the Sydney-based Designer of Eidolon: Angelus Morningstar. His works and style have been heavily influenced by a number of modern authors, who approach narratives in unique and complex ways, which have then been moulded by his studies in international relations, politics, diplomacy, jurisprudence, and sociology.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Book</h3>
</div>
<p>This campaign aims to help launch and distribute the upcoming book “Eidolon: The Electrodyne Opera”; an artistic masterpiece that is the result of more than four years of research and writing.</p>
<p>As a work of art, the object of this venture is not profit, but opening a rich setting to the world in hopes of inspiring others; aiming to provide a rich tapestry against which other authors, artists, and designers can create for themselves. In bringing out this setting, it is hoped to make a statement about the viability of story over systems, of the value of art as a venture for its own enjoyment.</p>
<p>Eidolon is predicated on the idea that narrative itself is a causal principle similar to natural laws; from this emerges an alternative history  where fact and fiction converge, providing a near-contemporary era analogous to Europe in the 1900s. </p>
<p><em><img alt=""Hardcopy"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://eidolon.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/hardcopy.jpg"" src="""" style=""border: 10px solid white; float: right;""/><strong>Content:</strong></em> Over 180,000 words all dedicated to setting, society, technology, people, and metaphysics.</p>
<p><strong><em>Artwork:</em> </strong>Over 200 distinct illustrations</p>
<p><strong><em>Size:</em> </strong>400 coloured pages</p>
<p><strong><em>Map:</em> </strong>Full-coloured glossy poster</p>
<p><strong><a href=""http://www.mediafire.com/view/?m725kq8w81w1awc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Introduction to Eidolon"">INTRODUCTION BOOKLET OF EIDOLON</a></strong></p>
<p><strong><a href=""http://youtu.be/xpuOvl2CJaM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Video Preview of Book"">VIDEO PREVIEW OF THE BOOK</a></strong></p>
<p>A supplementary booklet, which will contain the official ruleset for Eidolon, will be printed off with this run; it will be available for free as a pdf download, but this is your opportunity to get it printed with a glossy format.</p>
<p>It is important to note that it is intentional for the rules to be published separately; this allows more setting content in the core book, and explored in greater detail. Further, the setting should be independent of any system, as not all systems appeal equally. </p>
<div>
<h2>Funding</h2>
</div>
<p><span><img alt=""Slipcase"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://eidolon.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/slipcase.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; border: 5px solid white;""/>I'm printing this book no matter the end funding level; so regardless of what perks you choose, it will be honoured.</span></p>
<p>The base funding for this goal is modest; being the commissioning of a print-run of hard-copy books.</p>
<p>All profits raised from the sale of these books are being re-invested into the setting; to explore Eidolon in mediums beyond the core book in ways designed to complement it:</p>
<ul>
<li>A uniquely designed tarot deck, using the elaborate illustrations of Krista Brennan, and drawing upon the complex mythology of Eidolon. These cards can be used as a deluxe mechanism for telling stories in the setting.</li>
<li>The composition of an opera throughout 2013, by eminent composer Cameron Lam, one episode being released each month.</li>
<li>The creation of a board game, with pieces and board that can be used as props for the setting.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, the main ambition over the next year is to compose a official sound track for Eidolon, with twelve songs, using Cameron Lam's talent, and real chamber music sound. The following stretch goals will help fund that project over the next year. The intention would be to produce 12 original pieces of music, one for each month of the year, to be released each month.</p>
<p>The composition would follow two dramatic arcs, a romantic arc across the seasons of spring and summer, and a tragic arc across the seasons of autumn and winter; these arcs tie in heavily to the themes and movements within the setting.</p>
<p><strong>Funding target $7,000 Overture:</strong> Cameron Lam will compose and record an overture (one piece).</p>
<p><strong>Funding target $10,000 Season:</strong> Cameron Lam will compose and record a season of the music for the setting (three pieces).</p>
<p><strong>Funding target $13,000 Arc:</strong> Cameron Lam will compose and record a season of the music for the setting (six pieces). If this target is reached, everyone who has donated $25 or more will receive a free copy of the music as mp3s.</p>
<p><strong>Funding target $20,000 Opera:</strong> Cameron Lam will compose and record a season of the music for the setting (all twelve pieces). If this target is reached, everyone who has donated $15 or more will receive a free copy of the music as mp3s.</p>
<div>
<h3>Signal Boost</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>I am also a reviewer for ipadboardgames.org and frequently review game-related funders. If you have a game-related funder and become on of my funders, I'll refer to your project the next Friday.</p>
<p>Ipadboardgames.org receives over 20K unique visitors a month.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Schedule</h2>
</div>
<p>The soft-copy is scheduled to be completed for December 13th; if you purchase a copy of the pdf with any of the perks, it will be provided to you as soon as it's ready.</p>
<p>The hard copy print run (for maps, books, and slip cases), is intended to be completed by the end of January.</p>
<h3><span><strong>Shipping</strong></span></h3>
<p><span>Production is taking place in Australia, with shipping being sent boxed via post; shipping costs are currently being negotiated and this will be updated with comprehensive details as soon as they are finalised. As this funder is successful, shipping will be included.</span></p>

<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>Someone asked me ""what is this Eidolon thing you keep talking about?"" I had a lot of trouble coming up with a response. This is what eventually came out:<br/><br/>I am far from certain how to start describing Eidolon. As an editor, we’ve had something of a troubled relationship, which I suppose is fairly common. If writing a book is like having a long bout of illness, then I suppose editing one, particularly one such as this, is not unlike attempting to provide succour to one suffering a degenerative disorder, without the aid of instrument one, and nothing but a piece of mouldy bread and a bowl of leaches on hand.<br/><br/>What I am saying is that I love this project: a sprawling epic, very nearly all-encompassing, occasionally baffling or inspiring by turns. It is one small step away from being a hundred different things – an alternate history of humanity, apart from the fact that it clearly is not in any way such a thing; derivative, yet somehow avoiding such and being simply broadly inspired, integrating elements of very nearly myriad mythoi; an opera waiting to happen, which it just might be; an heroic poem, in the finest tradition of ancient dead dudes; and many other things – and yet it defies description or definition.</em></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>What I can tell you is that it is a joyous exploration of the boundless beauty of the English language; occasionally tongue-in-cheek, other times deeply moving, but always, always with layers of meaning to delight the mind and heart. It is storytelling as art and craft both, for the simple magnificence of a tale well told, and for the sake of charting new territory. It is a game for role-playing purists, and unashamedly so, making no apology for being less-than-perfectly accessible, but still seeking to welcome all who would partake.</em></p>

</div></div>","Summary
VIDEOS AND IMAGES OF THE BOOK ARE IN THE GALLERY
This is a project being launched by the Sydney-based Designer of Eidolon: Angelus Morningstar. His works and style have been heavily influenced by a number of modern authors, who approach narratives in unique and complex ways, which have then been moulded by his studies in international relations, politics, diplomacy, jurisprudence, and sociology.


The Book

This campaign aims to help launch and distribute the upcoming book “Eidolon: The Electrodyne Opera”; an artistic masterpiece that is the result of more than four years of research and writing.
As a work of art, the object of this venture is not profit, but opening a rich setting to the world in hopes of inspiring others; aiming to provide a rich tapestry against which other authors, artists, and designers can create for themselves. In bringing out this setting, it is hoped to make a statement about the viability of story over systems, of the value of art as a venture for its own enjoyment.
Eidolon is predicated on the idea that narrative itself is a causal principle similar to natural laws; from this emerges an alternative history  where fact and fiction converge, providing a near-contemporary era analogous to Europe in the 1900s. 
Content: Over 180,000 words all dedicated to setting, society, technology, people, and metaphysics.
Artwork: Over 200 distinct illustrations
Size: 400 coloured pages
Map: Full-coloured glossy poster
INTRODUCTION BOOKLET OF EIDOLON
VIDEO PREVIEW OF THE BOOK
A supplementary booklet, which will contain the official ruleset for Eidolon, will be printed off with this run; it will be available for free as a pdf download, but this is your opportunity to get it printed with a glossy format.
It is important to note that it is intentional for the rules to be published separately; this allows more setting content in the core book, and explored in greater detail. Further, the setting should be independent of any system, as not all systems appeal equally. 

Funding

I'm printing this book no matter the end funding level; so regardless of what perks you choose, it will be honoured.
The base funding for this goal is modest; being the commissioning of a print-run of hard-copy books.
All profits raised from the sale of these books are being re-invested into the setting; to explore Eidolon in mediums beyond the core book in ways designed to complement it:

A uniquely designed tarot deck, using the elaborate illustrations of Krista Brennan, and drawing upon the complex mythology of Eidolon. These cards can be used as a deluxe mechanism for telling stories in the setting.
The composition of an opera throughout 2013, by eminent composer Cameron Lam, one episode being released each month.
The creation of a board game, with pieces and board that can be used as props for the setting.

Stretch Goals
As mentioned above, the main ambition over the next year is to compose a official sound track for Eidolon, with twelve songs, using Cameron Lam's talent, and real chamber music sound. The following stretch goals will help fund that project over the next year. The intention would be to produce 12 original pieces of music, one for each month of the year, to be released each month.
The composition would follow two dramatic arcs, a romantic arc across the seasons of spring and summer, and a tragic arc across the seasons of autumn and winter; these arcs tie in heavily to the themes and movements within the setting.
Funding target $7,000 Overture: Cameron Lam will compose and record an overture (one piece).
Funding target $10,000 Season: Cameron Lam will compose and record a season of the music for the setting (three pieces).
Funding target $13,000 Arc: Cameron Lam will compose and record a season of the music for the setting (six pieces). If this target is reached, everyone who has donated $25 or more will receive a free copy of the music as mp3s.
Funding target $20,000 Opera: Cameron Lam will compose and record a season of the music for the setting (all twelve pieces). If this target is reached, everyone who has donated $15 or more will receive a free copy of the music as mp3s.

Signal Boost


I am also a reviewer for ipadboardgames.org and frequently review game-related funders. If you have a game-related funder and become on of my funders, I'll refer to your project the next Friday.
Ipadboardgames.org receives over 20K unique visitors a month.


Schedule

The soft-copy is scheduled to be completed for December 13th; if you purchase a copy of the pdf with any of the perks, it will be provided to you as soon as it's ready.
The hard copy print run (for maps, books, and slip cases), is intended to be completed by the end of January.
Shipping
Production is taking place in Australia, with shipping being sent boxed via post; shipping costs are currently being negotiated and this will be updated with comprehensive details as soon as they are finalised. As this funder is successful, shipping will be included.

<p> </p>
<p><em><strong>We are trying to raise funds to send/take Cody's used wheelchair and a few other supplies to a 5 year old with cerebral palsy in Colombia. Please contribute! For more details read the story below*  &lt;3</strong></em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>One day as I was stopping by a friend’s Facebook page to leave a friendly hello I came across a picture of a very special little boy called <strong>Rony</strong>. His mother, Yali, who had met my friend during one of his travels in Colombia was leaving a desperate message asking for help for her son. Somehow, I, the mother of another very special little boy, <strong>Cody</strong>, happened to see the picture and read the message.</p>
<p>I contacted Yali myself to find out more about her son. I learned that Rony, just like my son Cody, was diagnosed with cerebral palsy. These two little boys, born in different hemispheres, thousands of miles away reflect an eye opening reality… the colossal disparity of life conditions in our world.</p>
<p>Cody is 8 years old and Rony is 5. Cody and Rony have a lot in common, although they are both school age children, neither of them can speak. Cody and Rony also can’t walk, sit on their bottoms and have difficulty grabbing and holding objects. Both of them have motor problems that make it difficult for them to chew and swallow their food, and sometimes these difficulties make them get seriously sick. They are both really thin. Cody and Rony need to be fed by adults and still wear diapers.</p>
<p>Another thing Cody and Rony have in common are parents that love them and would do anything to help their lives be the best it can be. But the main difference between these two little boys, born with the same diagnosis, is that one of them was born here in the United States and the other was born in Colombia.</p>
<p>Over the 8 years of my son Cody’s life, he has received care and aid from all sorts of professionals that have been amazing. Some of the help came from government programs, and other services from our private health insurance. None of the help has been easy to get, or taken for granted. Over the years I have learned what Cody is guaranteed by law, what different insurance companies cover, and how to jump though all sorts of hoops to get services and equipment that Cody needed. If you have a family member with chronic health needs, especially in your immediate family, you are probably aware that managing medical needs is a complex and almost full time job.</p>
<p>Today, my son Cody has a full support wheelchair, a special chair to take a bath, a feeding seat where he is fed and watches his beloved cartoons and other necessary medical equipment. Cody is in 2<sup>nd</sup> grade and goes to school every day at a regular school, where he attends special education classes. The school bus with a lift picks him up every day. Cody’s progress is really slow and almost invisible to the outside eye, but the most important thing is that he is given opportunities and best quality of life we can give him.</p>
<p>Rony, all the way in Colombia also lives with his parents. Children like Rony are not entitled to any government help. He is also not entitled to any equipment or physical therapy. Anything that Rony needs must be privately purchased by his parents. Rony is on a total liquid diet and his parents have difficulty purchasing enriched formula because it is expensive and considered a specialty item in the small Andes town where they live. Large items like specialized equipment are things this family rarely comes across and cost much more than they can afford. Rony has a wheelchair, but just a regular one, not a child wheelchair that supports his head since he cannot support it on his own; as a result, Rony rarely leaves the house. He is bathed in a baby bath tub, but this is too small for him at this point and besides being unsafe it causes him to bump and scratch parts of his body that barely fit in the tub. Rony spends most of his days laying down and he is only seated when he is on someone’s lap. His parents prop him up with blankets to elevate him but this is not very comfortable for him and he slides down easily. Rony doesn’t attend school, he has experienced several seizures and the school doesn’t feel they have any medical resources to attend to his health in case he experiences seizures at school. As a Brazilian and fellow South American, I understand firsthand that these hardworking families do they best they can within their knowledge, culture and resources.</p>
<p>The reason I am telling you the story of these two little boys who are so alike, yet reflect how unequal life conditions are in our world is to ask for your help. I have a wheelchair at my house, it was used by Cody for about 5 years of his life and he now has a new one. A wheelchair like this, in United States costs thousands of dollars and it is sitting in my garage.</p>
<p><strong>I am trying to raise funds to either ship or take this wheelchair to Rony, whichever is cheapest.</strong> <strong>We might be able to send/take other items along with the chair if we raise more money. The idea is to maximize the funds in order to send them as much as possible in the cheapest possible way.**</strong></p>
<p>This donation would simply improve Rony’s and his family’s quality of life. I am also looking for a feeding chair (such as a medium tumble form*) and a bath chair if anyone with special need’s children have one that is no longer being used that could be donated. Pediasure and diapers size 3 and up are also welcome.</p>
<p>I know there are people in need all over world and it is hard to help all of them, but Rony and his family are the ones who crossed my friend Jamie’s path, and in consequence, my path… and are now crossing yours… and I think if we do what is in our reach to help the one person we can… we are doing our part.</p>

<p>** if not enough funds are raised we will regroup to try other avenues. If more than the goal amount is raised we will work in partnership with the family to see which additional items would be beneficial to Rony and can be shipped/taken to Colombia. This is a one time gift. Anything exceeding this contributions will be donated to the American organization United Cerebral Palsy (UCP).</p></div>","HELP CODY DONATE HIS WHEELCHAIR TO A LITTLE BUDDY IN COLOMBIA!!

I contacted Yali myself to find out more about her son. I learned that Rony, just like my son Cody, was diagnosed with cerebral palsy. These two little boys, born in different hemispheres, thousands of miles away reflect an eye opening reality… the colossal disparity of life conditions in our world.
Cody is 8 years old and Rony is 5. Cody and Rony have a lot in common, although they are both school age children, neither of them can speak. Cody and Rony also can’t walk, sit on their bottoms and have difficulty grabbing and holding objects. Both of them have motor problems that make it difficult for them to chew and swallow their food, and sometimes these difficulties make them get seriously sick. They are both really thin. Cody and Rony need to be fed by adults and still wear diapers.
Another thing Cody and Rony have in common are parents that love them and would do anything to help their lives be the best it can be. But the main difference between these two little boys, born with the same diagnosis, is that one of them was born here in the United States and the other was born in Colombia.
Over the 8 years of my son Cody’s life, he has received care and aid from all sorts of professionals that have been amazing. Some of the help came from government programs, and other services from our private health insurance. None of the help has been easy to get, or taken for granted. Over the years I have learned what Cody is guaranteed by law, what different insurance companies cover, and how to jump though all sorts of hoops to get services and equipment that Cody needed. If you have a family member with chronic health needs, especially in your immediate family, you are probably aware that managing medical needs is a complex and almost full time job.
Today, my son Cody has a full support wheelchair, a special chair to take a bath, a feeding seat where he is fed and watches his beloved cartoons and other necessary medical equipment. Cody is in 2nd grade and goes to school every day at a regular school, where he attends special education classes. The school bus with a lift picks him up every day. Cody’s progress is really slow and almost invisible to the outside eye, but the most important thing is that he is given opportunities and best quality of life we can give him.
Rony, all the way in Colombia also lives with his parents. Children like Rony are not entitled to any government help. He is also not entitled to any equipment or physical therapy. Anything that Rony needs must be privately purchased by his parents. Rony is on a total liquid diet and his parents have difficulty purchasing enriched formula because it is expensive and considered a specialty item in the small Andes town where they live. Large items like specialized equipment are things this family rarely comes across and cost much more than they can afford. Rony has a wheelchair, but just a regular one, not a child wheelchair that supports his head since he cannot support it on his own; as a result, Rony rarely leaves the house. He is bathed in a baby bath tub, but this is too small for him at this point and besides being unsafe it causes him to bump and scratch parts of his body that barely fit in the tub. Rony spends most of his days laying down and he is only seated when he is on someone’s lap. His parents prop him up with blankets to elevate him but this is not very comfortable for him and he slides down easily. Rony doesn’t attend school, he has experienced several seizures and the school doesn’t feel they have any medical resources to attend to his health in case he experiences seizures at school. As a Brazilian and fellow South American, I understand firsthand that these hardworking families do they best they can within their knowledge, culture and resources.
The reason I am telling you the story of these two little boys who are so alike, yet reflect how unequal life conditions are in our world is to ask for your help. I have a wheelchair at my house, it was used by Cody for about 5 years of his life and he now has a new one. A wheelchair like this, in United States costs thousands of dollars and it is sitting in my garage.
I am trying to raise funds to either ship or take this wheelchair to Rony, whichever is cheapest. We might be able to send/take other items along with the chair if we raise more money. The idea is to maximize the funds in order to send them as much as possible in the cheapest possible way.**
This donation would simply improve Rony’s and his family’s quality of life. I am also looking for a feeding chair (such as a medium tumble form*) and a bath chair if anyone with special need’s children have one that is no longer being used that could be donated. Pediasure and diapers size 3 and up are also welcome.
I know there are people in need all over world and it is hard to help all of them, but Rony and his family are the ones who crossed my friend Jamie’s path, and in consequence, my path… and are now crossing yours… and I think if we do what is in our reach to help the one person we can… we are doing our part.

** if not enough funds are raised we will regroup to try other avenues. If more than the goal amount is raised we will work in partnership with the family to see which additional items would be beneficial to Rony and can be shipped/taken to Colombia. This is a one time gift. Anything exceeding this contributions will be donated to the American organization United Cerebral Palsy (UCP).",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-style: normal;"">Everybody likes to help others. However, it is not always possible to contribute due to financial or physical reasons. Our project aims to overcome this barrier and help everyone who wants to help through their own experiences and knowledge in a creative way: knitting. We provide all materials and teach how to knit, there are no expenses for the volunteer. Our objectives:</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-style: normal;"">1. Spending free time in a rewarding way: helping other people. Because we believe on the power of love!</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-style: normal;"">2. Making people feel useful. Because we can create a network of solidarity!</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-style: normal;"">3. Supporting responsible textile consumption. Because we have a traditional yarn culture that we cannot forget!</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-style: normal;"">4. Implementing social and charity projects. Because we can do something positive!</span></p>
<p><b style=""font-style: normal;""><b><i><b></b></i></b></b></p>
<p><b style=""font-style: normal;""><b><i><b><b></b></b></i></b></b></p>
<h3><b style=""font-style: normal;""><b><i><b><b><i>Who are we? </i></b></b></i></b></b></h3>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-style: normal;"">We are a few people that organize and coordinate volunteer knitting activities aimed primarily at groups of elderly people (experienced and also beginner knitters) who bring us their love and dedication, while giving visibility to their knowledge and skills, motivating and improving self esteem. Thanks to them, we generate funds to develop social programs.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-style: normal;"">Wir stellen das notwendige Material bereit und zeigen wie es funktioniert. Es gibt keine Kosten für den ehrenamtlichen Mitarbeiter.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;""></span></p>
<p>Es handelt sich um eine eigene Herausforderung, die egoistischen Verhaltensweisen abzulehnen und sich der Probleme bewusst zu werden, die es in unserem Umfeld gibt.</p>
<p>Es geht darum, die wichtigen Dinge zu lernen, die uns das Leben anbietet.</p>
<p>Es geht darum andere zu überzeugen, dass wir alle einen kleinen Betrag leisten können.</p>
<p>Es geht darum die Werte des ländlichen Raumes zu unterstützen und diese in den Städten zu übermitteln.</p>
<p>Es geht darum kreativ zu sein und positive Dinge zu versuchen.</p>
<b><i>Was machen wir?</i></b><br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-style: normal;"">Wir fördern Aktivitäten, die im Zusammenhang mit Handwerksarbeit stehen und vor allem an ältere Menschen adressiert sind und einen respektvollen Umgang mit der Umwelt einschließen.</span></p>

</h3><h3><br/></h3></div>","¿En qué consiste el proyecto?

Creemos que a todo el mundo le gusta poder ayudar a los demás. Sin embargo, no siempre es posible hacerlo debido a razones económicas o físicas. Nuestro proyecto persigue superar estas barreras y permitir a quien quiera ayudar, hacerlo a través de la transmisión de su propia experiencia y conocimientos de una manera creativa: Tejiendo. 
Visitamos centros de mayores, buscamos quien quiera tejer para proyectos sociales, les facilitamos todo el material y, si no saben, enseñamos cómo hacerlo. 
Nuestros objetivos:
1. Ocupar el tiempo libre de una manera reconfortante: ayudando a otras personas. ¡Por qué creemos en el poder del amor!
2. Hacer que las personas se sientan útiles. ¡Queremos crear una red de solidaridad!
3. Incentivando un consumo textil responsable. ¡Por qué tenemos una tradición de labores que no podemos olvidar!
4. Implementar proyectos sociales. ¡Por qué juntos podemos hacer algo positivo! 

¿Quiénes somos?
Somos unas cuantas personas que organizamos y coordinamos actividades relacionadas con la Terapia de labores, dirigidas principalmente a personas mayores (tanto con experiencia como con ganas de aprender), quienes nos dan su cariño y dedicación, al tiempo que damos visibilidad a sus trabajos y habilidades, motivándoles y mejorando su autoestima. Gracias a ellos desarrollamos proyectos sociales. 

¿Por qué creemos en este proyecto?
Trabajamos para ejecutar proyectos sociales y creemos que podemos hacerlo añadiendo valor de una manera creativa mediante la Terapia de labores. Nuestro objetivo es crear una red de solidaridad. 

¿Qué significa este proyecto para nosotros?
Se trata de un reto personal, rechazando las actitudes egoístas y tomando conciencia de los problemas que hay a nuestro alrededor. 
Se trata de aprender de las cosas importantes que nos ofrece la vida. 
Se trata de hacer ver a los demás que todos podemos aportar nuestro granito de arena (o nuestro ""grannie"" de lana).
Se trata de apoyar los valores del mundo rural y acercarlos a la ciudad.
Se trata de ser creativo e intentar hacer cosas positivas. 

¿Qué hacemos?
Visitamos residencias, centros de día, hogares… y promocionamos actividades enfocadas a la realización de Terapia de labores, dirigidas principalmente a la gente mayor, de una manera respetuosa con el medio ambiente, permitiendo asimismo la transmisión de una cultura de comercio ético; dirigiendo las actividades hacia un consumo textil responsable, usando, seleccionando y promoviendo fibras naturales y ecológicas de manera que nos permitan contribuir a un desarrollo sostenible.
Asimismo queremos apoyar otras iniciativas, que persigan los mismos objetivos que nosotros. 

Objetivos del proyecto
Objetivos del proyecto:
·De 28.000 horas tejiendo el primer año a más de 192.000 en 3 años.
·  De 1.400 kg de lanas/hilos el primer año a 9.600 kg en 3 años.
·  De 120 voluntarios tejedores el primer año a más de 800 en 3 años.
·  Acuerdos con más de 100 centros/ONGs, entidades sociales...
·  Ejecutar proyectos sociales en España y otros países. 
·  Desarrollar una plataforma IAIA 2.0 (www.Laiaia.org, Linkedin, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest)
¿A dónde van dirigidos los fondos?
Estamos recaudando fondos para crear una Fundación. La Fundación IAIA persigue 2 objetivos: (1) hacer sentir útil a otras personas a través de su dedicación con la Terapia de labores y (2) desarrollar y ejecutar proyectos sociales.
¿Qué necesitamos y qué obtienes?
Necesitamos recaudar 37.000 euros. Este dinero servirá para poner en marcha el proyecto y ayudar a que muchas personas puedan ayudar a los demás (dotación inicial de constitución de una Fundación, compra de lanas y material, gastos de transporte para visitar residencias). Es un proyecto a largo plazo, donde esperamos crear empleo para seguir trabajando en ello.
Si no llegamos al objetivo para la creación de la Fundación, destinaremos el importe final que hayamos recaudado a la compra de material y transporte para las visitas a residencias de personas mayores, para garantizar que puedan seguir tejiendo solidaridad.

What is this project about?

Everybody likes to help others. However, it is not always possible to contribute due to financial or physical reasons. Our project aims to overcome this barrier and help everyone who wants to help through their own experiences and knowledge in a creative way: knitting. We provide all materials and teach how to knit, there are no expenses for the volunteer. Our objectives:
1. Spending free time in a rewarding way: helping other people. Because we believe on the power of love!
2. Making people feel useful. Because we can create a network of solidarity!
3. Supporting responsible textile consumption. Because we have a traditional yarn culture that we cannot forget!
4. Implementing social and charity projects. Because we can do something positive!


Who are we? 

We are a few people that organize and coordinate volunteer knitting activities aimed primarily at groups of elderly people (experienced and also beginner knitters) who bring us their love and dedication, while giving visibility to their knowledge and skills, motivating and improving self esteem. Thanks to them, we generate funds to develop social programs.

Why this project?

Together we work hard to help people by executing social and charity projects and we would greatly value your contribution to this knitting project. We can create a network of solidarity.


What this projects means for us

This is about personal growth, saying no to selfishness and becoming more aware of our surroundings.
It is about learning things that matter in life and about enjoying daily things that we have forgotten to realize.
It is about to be able to tell other people they can help more needy people.
It is about offering a helping-hand to the values of rural world to come closer to the city.
It is about being creative and by trying to do something positive.


What can we do?

We promote activities aimed at developing the production of craft works, mainly by elderly people, in a way that respects the environment as well as the dissemination of a culture of ethical trade, conducting activities towards responsible textile consumption, using, selecting and providing natural and ecological textile fibers contributing to sustainable development.
All the money we granted will be addressed to social and charity projects.
We also support other initiatives, with the same objectives than us.

Auf was beruht das Projekt?

Wir glauben, dass es allen gefällt anderen zu helfen. Jedoch ist dies aus wirtschaftlichen oder physischen Gründen nicht immer möglich. Unser Projekt strebt eine Überwindung dieser Barrieren an und hilft allen, die mittels der Weitergabe der eigenen Erfahrungen und Kenntnisse auf kreative Art und Weise helfen möchten: Häkeln.
Wir stellen das notwendige Material bereit und zeigen wie es funktioniert. Es gibt keine Kosten für den ehrenamtlichen Mitarbeiter.
Warum sind wir von diesem Projekt überzeugt?
Wir arbeiten, um soziale Projekte durchzuführen und wir glauben, dass wir einen Mehrwert auf kreative Art und Weise mittels der Handwerksarbeit schaffen. Unser Ziel ist es ein Netzwerk der Solidarität zu errichten.
Was bedeutet dieses Projekt für uns?

Es handelt sich um eine eigene Herausforderung, die egoistischen Verhaltensweisen abzulehnen und sich der Probleme bewusst zu werden, die es in unserem Umfeld gibt.
Es geht darum, die wichtigen Dinge zu lernen, die uns das Leben anbietet.
Es geht darum andere zu überzeugen, dass wir alle einen kleinen Betrag leisten können.
Es geht darum die Werte des ländlichen Raumes zu unterstützen und diese in den Städten zu übermitteln.
Es geht darum kreativ zu sein und positive Dinge zu versuchen.
Was machen wir?

Wir fördern Aktivitäten, die im Zusammenhang mit Handwerksarbeit stehen und vor allem an ältere Menschen adressiert sind und einen respektvollen Umgang mit der Umwelt einschließen.
Dies steht im Zusammenhang mit der Verbreitung einer Kultur des ethischen Handels und Aktivitäten hin zu einem verantwortlichen Textilverbrauch: die Verarbeitung, Auswahl und Förderung von natürlichen und ökologisch gewonnenen Fasern, um einen Beitrag zu einer nachhaltigen Entwicklung zu leisten.




Die Einnahmen aus diesen Aktivitäten werden für soziale Projekte verwendet.
Ziele des Projekts
Von 28.000 Stunden Handarbeit im ersten Jahr, ansteigend auf 192.000 Stunden in drei Jahren

Von 120 freiwilligen Webern im ersten Jahr, ansteigend auf mehr als 800 im dritten Jahr
Durchführung von sozialen Projekten in Spanien und anderen Ländern

Wir sammeln Einnahmen zwecks Gründung einer Nichtregierungsorganisation. Die Stiftung IAIA verfolgt zwei wesentliche Ziele:
(1)Mittels Handwerksarbeit Menschen das Gefühl geben, dass sie sich nützlich fühlen
(2)Soziale Projekte entwickeln und ausführen
Was benötigen wir und was bekommst Du?
Wir benötigen 37.000 Euro für die Gründung einer Stiftung. Dieses Geld dient dazu das Projekt in Gang zu setzen.
Wir versuchen öffentliches Interesse und Unterstützung zu generieren. Jeder kann sich uns anschließen, der Interesse am Häkeln hat oder dies lernen möchte.
Wenn wir das Ziel für die Gründung der Stiftung nicht erreichen, wird die endgültige Menge, die wir angesprochen haben, um Ausrüstung und Transportmittel für Besuche in Altenheimen kaufen zu spenden, um sicherzustellen, dass sie weiterhin Solidarität weben
Andere Arten uns zu helfen

Quel est le projet?
Nous croyons que tout le monde aime aider les autres. Cependant, ceci n'est pas toujours possible à cause de raisons économiques ou physiques. Notre projet vise à surmonter ces obstacles et aider tous ceux qui veulent aider à travers la transmission de leur propre expérience et connaissances d'une manière créative: en tricotant. Nous fournissons tous les matériaux et apprenons à le faire, il n'y a aucun frais pour le volontaire.
Nos objectifs:

2. Faire que les gens se sentent utiles. Nous voulons créer un réseau de solidarité!
3. Encourager la consommation textile responsable. Parce qu’on a une tradition d’artisanat textile que l’on ne peut pas oublier!
4. Mettre en œuvre des projets sociaux. Parce qu'ensemble nous pouvons faire quelque chose de positif!
Qui sommes-nous?
Nous sommes quelques personnes (de différents pays) à organiser et coordonner des activités liées à l’artisanat textile, visant principalement des personnes âgées (à la fois expérimentés et désireux d'apprendre), qui nous donnent leur amour et leur dévouement, alors que nous offrons de la visibilité à leurs travaux et compétences. Nous les motivons ainsi et améliorons leur estime de soi. Grace à eux, nous générons des fonds pour développer des projets sociaux.

Nous travaillons pour mettre en œuvre des projets sociaux et nous croyons que nous pouvons faire cela en ajoutant de la valeur d'une manière créative à travers l'artisanat textile. Notre objectif est de créer un réseau de solidarité

Que signifie ce projet pour nous?
Il s’agit d’un défi personnel, cherchant à rejeter les attitudes égoïstes et à prendre conscience des problèmes qui nous entourent.
Il s’agit d'apprendre les choses importantes que nous offre la vie.
Il s'agit de convaincre les autres que nous pouvons tous apporter notre grain de sable.
Il s'agit de soutenir les valeurs des zones rurales et les rapprocher à la ville.
Il s'agit d'être créatif et d'essayer de faire des choses positives.
Que faisons-nous?
Nous faisons la promotion d’activités visant à la réalisation d’artisanat textile, visant principalement aux personnes âgées, d'une manière qui respecte l'environnement, ce qui permet aussi la transmission d'une culture du commerce éthique; en dirigeant les activités vers une consommation textile responsable, en utilisant, sélectionnant et promouvant les fibres naturelles écologiques nous permettant ainsi contribuer à un développement durable.
Les fonds amassés seront investis dans des projets sociaux.
De même, nous désirons soutenir d'autres initiatives, qui travaillent vers les mêmes objectifs que nous.

(version italiano)
Quale è il progetto?
Crediamo che a tutti piace aiutare gli altri. Tuttavia, non è sempre possibile a causa di ragioni economiche o fisiche. Il nostro progetto cerca di superare questi ostacoli e aiutare tutti coloro che vogliono contribuire attraverso la trasmissione dalla sua propria esperienza e conoscenza in modo creativo: lavorare a maglia. Noi forniamo tutti i materiali e insegniamo come farlo, non essiste alcun costo per il collaboratore.
I nostri obiettivi:
1.Occupare il tempo libero in modo riconfortante: aiutando gli altri. Perché noi crediamo nel potere dell'amore!
2.Rendere le persone si sentano utili. Vogliamo creare una rete di solidarietà!
3.Incoraggiare il consumo tessile responsabile. Perché abbiamo una tradizione di manifattura artigianale che non possiamo dimenticare!
4.Istituire progetti sociali. Perché insieme possiamo fare qualcosa di positivo!
Chi siamo?
Siamo un bel po’ di persone (provenienti da diversi paesi) che organizziamo e coordiniamo attività collegate con la manifattura artigianale, principalmente rivolto alle persone anziane (siano esperti oppure desiderosi di imparare), che ci danno il loro amore e dedicazione, mentre noi diamo visibilità a loro lavoro e competenze, cercando di motivargli e migliorare loro autostima. Grazie ai loro lavori si genera il capitale per sviluppare progetti sociali.

Lavoriamo per realizzare progetti sociali e crediamo di poter farlo aggiungendo valore attraverso un lavoro artigianale creativo. Il nostro obiettivo è quello di creare una rete di solidarietà.

Che cosa significa questo progetto per noi?
Si tratta di una sfida personale, rifiuttando gli atteggiamenti egoistici e prendendo conaspevolenzza dei problemi che ci circondano.
Cerchiamo d’ imparare dalle cose importante che la vita ci offre.
Cerchiamo di convincere gli altri che tutti noi possiamo dare il nostro contributo.
Cerchiamo sostenere i valori delle zone rurali e avicinali alla città.
Cerchiamo di essere creativi e di fare cose positive.
Che cosa facciamo?
Promuoviamo attività rivolte a realizare lavori artigianali, principalmente indirizzato alle persone anziane, in modo rispettoso per l'ambiente, permettendo anche la trasmissione di una cultura del commercio etico; orientiamo le attività verso il consumo tessile responsabile,  selezionando e la promuovendo l’uso di fibre naturali ed organiche in modo di contribuire allo sviluppo sostenibile.
I fondi raccolti saranno destinati a progetti sociali.

Di che cosa abbiamo bisogno e che cosa si ottiene?
Abbiamo bisogno di raccogliere 37.000€ per coprire il finanziamento iniziale per la costituzione di una Fondazione. Questi soldi saranno utilizzati per lanciare il progetto.
Cerchiamo di generare interesse pubblico e di sostegno. Chiunque può unirsi a noi, se è interessato a lavorare a maglia o imparare a farelo.

<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Los recuerdos afloran a la superficie, impulsados por la emotividad de cinco guerrilleros y un perro, atrapados en la incógnita del tiempo. Vida y muerte se mezclan de modo indisoluble en la narración, consiguiendo que tanto el pasado como el presente articulen los soportes de idéntica denuncia.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">La crítica estructura el monólogo de Fidel Dopico Moldón; su amor por Alecrín (sepultada junto a él), atenúa el dolor de muchos resentimientos; y en la firme determinación de hacer llegar su testimonio a las generaciones venideras, se vislumbra un obsesivo deseo de que nada de lo ocurrido vuelva a suceder.</p>

Through reading about the experiences of former student-athletes and those who work within college athletics, you will be well prepared to OWN IT during your time as an athlete and also in your career afterward.<br/><br/>My name is Jess Cook and I am the author of OWN IT. I wrote this book because I found my student-athlete experience to be valuable, and other student-athletes feel the exact same way. As a student-athlete, you are given a very unique opportunity, so why not make the most of it? I want future and current college athletes to realize what the student-athlete experience is all about. Along with this, I want former athletes to discover how they can leverage their previous experience to propel them in several areas of their lives.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how to OWN the student-athlete experience at the collegiate level. In this book, I hope to instill the same passion and excitement that I have for the personal development that occurs within college athletics in you. And then ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you excel in other areas of your life outside of athletics. <br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn how to OWN IT and how to leverage your student-athlete experience to discover success:</p><p>The story of Ryan Gilliam - Ryan had his sights set on becoming a player in the NFL. This dream was not out of his reach, but that all changed after one play in a critical game. Ryan found himself lost and had to become open to new opportunities outside of football. </p><p>The story of Jenna Lilley - Jenna was an Oregon Duck. She was a nationally known for playing third base for the softball team. Through her student-athlete experience she was able to combine her academic and athletic passions. Connecting her passions added significant value to her collegiate athlete experience.</p><p>The story of Kendall Spencer - Kendall is someone who definitely made the most out of his student-athlete experience. Keeping himself busy throughout all hours of the day, Kendall was able to become a National Champion and also a leader on a national stage. This would not have been possible if sacrifices were not made.</p><p>The story of Tommy Zagorski - Tommy was the definition of a hard worker, in every aspect of his life. Football was his passion and he did not let anything get in the way of that, until he experienced a series of unfortunate events. Tommy discovered that having the opportunity to play the sport you are most passionate about at the collegiate level is truly a privilege.</p><p>You will love this book if you want to learn more about the lessons learned and the skills gained from being a collegiate athlete.<br/><br/>OWN IT: Navigating the College Athlete Experience to a Successful Career and Lifeis a non-fiction book that speaks to future, current, and former student-athletes. </p><h2><strong style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Book - OWN IT</strong></h2><p>The book is written in 3 parts.<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the introduction, as well as Chapters 1 and 2. In the introduction, we will discuss how a majority of business leaders were collegiate athletes. From there, the book goes onto put all the misconceptions about student-athletes to rest. In Chapter 2, each component of the OWN IT structure is introduced at the surface: Openness, Willpower, Nerve, Introspection, and Teamwork.<br/><br/>Part 2 contains Chapters 3-13. This portion of the book explores the OWN IT framework in depth. Readers will learn through the experiences of myself and others, combined with research. Each component of OWN IT can take on a few different angles. Part 2 allows you to explore all angles to discover how you can fit each component into your life as a future, current, or former student-athlete.<br/><br/>Part 3 contains Chapters 14-15 along with the conclusion. This is where it all comes full circle. The reader will discover how to OWN IT in areas outside of their sport, such as in their professional career. Being a student-athlete provides you with a unique skillset that separates you from the pack. Part 3 will show you how you can use it to your advantage.</p><h2><strong>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</strong></h2><p>This book will be published with New Degree Press.

</ul><h2><strong>About the Author</strong></h2><p>Jess Cook is a former student-athlete who played softball and was heavily involved on her college campus. Now a young professional in the professional sports world, she has realized how valuable her time as a student-athlete was. Jess studied Sports Studies, Business, and Entrepreneurship at John Carroll University. <br/><br/>Jess wrote this book because she was fascinated by the personal development that occurs through the student-athlete experience. If done correctly, being a collegiate athlete can help you excel in various aspects of your life. Jess wanted to help future and current student athletes discover the ways to make the most out of their experience. She also wanted former athletes to realize that their experience prepared them to be successful outside of their sport.<br/><br/>Sports and fitness are what Jess has been all about starting from a young age. She used these as focal points during her time as a student at John Carroll University. Not to mention, she continued to root for all Pittsburgh sports teams while going to college in Cleveland, Ohio. Outside of this, there's nothing Jess values more than family and friends.<br/><br/>For more information you can connect with Jess through email at owing.jesscook@gmail.com and on LinkedIn at <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessica-l-cook/."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessica-l-cook/.</a></p><h2><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h2><p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.<br/><br/>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.</p><h2><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h2><p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p><ul>

In this book, I hope to instill the same passion and excitement that I have for the personal development that occurs within college athletics in you. And then ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you excel in other areas of your life outside of athletics. In this book, you'll learn how to OWN IT and how to leverage your student-athlete experience to discover success:The story of Ryan Gilliam - Ryan had his sights set on becoming a player in the NFL. This dream was not out of his reach, but that all changed after one play in a critical game. Ryan found himself lost and had to become open to new opportunities outside of football. The story of Jenna Lilley - Jenna was an Oregon Duck. She was a nationally known for playing third base for the softball team. Through her student-athlete experience she was able to combine her academic and athletic passions. Connecting her passions added significant value to her collegiate athlete experience.The story of Kendall Spencer - Kendall is someone who definitely made the most out of his student-athlete experience. Keeping himself busy throughout all hours of the day, Kendall was able to become a National Champion and also a leader on a national stage. This would not have been possible if sacrifices were not made.The story of Tommy Zagorski - Tommy was the definition of a hard worker, in every aspect of his life. Football was his passion and he did not let anything get in the way of that, until he experienced a series of unfortunate events. Tommy discovered that having the opportunity to play the sport you are most passionate about at the collegiate level is truly a privilege.You will love this book if you want to learn more about the lessons learned and the skills gained from being a collegiate athlete.OWN IT: Navigating the College Athlete Experience to a Successful Career and Lifeis a non-fiction book that speaks to future, current, and former student-athletes. The Book - OWN ITThe book is written in 3 parts.Part 1 contains the introduction, as well as Chapters 1 and 2.

About the AuthorJess Cook is a former student-athlete who played softball and was heavily involved on her college campus. Now a young professional in the professional sports world, she has realized how valuable her time as a student-athlete was. Jess studied Sports Studies, Business, and Entrepreneurship at John Carroll University. Jess wrote this book because she was fascinated by the personal development that occurs through the student-athlete experience. If done correctly, being a collegiate athlete can help you excel in various aspects of your life. Jess wanted to help future and current student athletes discover the ways to make the most out of their experience. She also wanted former athletes to realize that their experience prepared them to be successful outside of their sport.Sports and fitness are what Jess has been all about starting from a young age. She used these as focal points during her time as a student at John Carroll University. Not to mention, she continued to root for all Pittsburgh sports teams while going to college in Cleveland, Ohio. Outside of this, there's nothing Jess values more than family and friends.For more information you can connect with Jess through email at owing.jesscook@gmail.com and on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessica-l-cook/.Risks & ChallengesThe biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you.

The festive holiday season has always included a more somber side, and scary tales of child-stealing demons to ghost stories told ‘round the fireplace go back to pre-Christian celebrations. These long-standing traditions have found modern expression in Christmas horror film and television shows, a unique and sometimes controversial subgenre that cheerfully drives a stake of holly through the heart of cherished Christmas customs.Yuletide Terror: Christmas Horror on Film and Television, the latest book by Canadian micro-publisher Spectacular Optical, offers a definitive, in-depth exploration of the history of these subversive film and television presentations that allow viewers to engage in different ways with the complicated cultural history of the Christmas season.Yuletide Terror collects over 20 essays and interviews that will deck your halls with insightful looks at all your festive fright favourites, including the BBC’s A Ghost Story for Christmas anthology series and contentious 1980s Santa slashers like Silent Night, Deadly Night. Unwrapping the true meaning of films featuring everyone from the Krampus and Scrooge to killer snowmen and evil elves, Yuletide Terror is a comprehensive look at TV and cinematic holiday horror from around the world, and includes a compendium including nearly 200 Christmas horror film reviews. This new anthology, set to be released for Christmas 2017, is the latest addition to Spectacular Optical’s line of cult film and pop culture books including Kid Power!, Satanic Panic: Pop-Cultural Paranoia in the 1980s and Lost Girls: The Phantasmagorical Cinema Of Jean Rollin.Yuletide Terror features new writing by both emerging and acclaimed authors including Stephen Thrower (Nightmare USA), Kim Newman (Nightmare Movies), Caelum Vatnsdal (They Came From Within: A History Of Canadian Horror Cinema), Michael Gingold (Rue Morgue), Shelagh Rowan-Legg (The Spanish Fantastic), Alexandra West (Films Of The New French Extremity), Michael Helms (Fatal Visions), Andrea Subissati (Rue Morgue), Zack Carlson (Destroy All Movies!!!), Joanna Wilson (The Christmas TV Companion), Diane A. Rodgers (Cinema Retro), Andrew Nette (Pulp Curry), Amanda Reyes (Made For TV Mayhem), David Bertrand (Satanic Panic), Eric Zaldivar (Co-Writer, Django Lives!), Leslie Hatton (Popshifter), Owen Williams (Empire), Ralph Elawani (Bleu Nuit: Histoire D’un Cinéphilie Nocturne), Derek Johnston (Haunted Seasons: Television Ghost Stories For Christmas And Horror For Halloween), Neil Mitchell (Devil’s Advocates: Carrie), Chris Hallock (Diabolique), Ariel Fisher (Rue Morgue), Lee Gambin (Nope, Nothing Wrong Here: The Making Of Cujo), Zach Clark (Writer/Director, White Reindeer) alongside co-editors Kier-La Janisse (House of Psychotic Women) and Paul Corupe (Canuxploitation).The book also features Motion Picture Purgatory comic reviews of Christmas horror films by underground cartoonist Rick Trembles, and original illustrations by British artist Alisdair Wood.

As part of this campaign, we will be releasing a new Christmas horror short film made to accompany the book, written and directed by Sean Hogan (THE DEVIL’S BUSINESS) and produced by Deviant Films, the team who brought you FUTURE SHOCK! THE STORY OF 2000AD. The short film—a windswept ghost story set on England’s southeastern coast called WE ALWAYS FIND OURSELVES IN THE SEA—will accompany book launch events throughout November/December in advance of its online premiere on Christmas Eve, as a nod to the British broadcasting tradition of Christmas ghost stories.A lonely recluse prepares to celebrate Christmas alone, when a figure from his past unexpectedly reappears. But are the old ghosts stirred up by her arrival just bad memories or something more?“Being able to make a small contribution to the Christmas ghost story tradition has me feeling like, well, a kid at Christmas,” says Hogan. “That particular juxtaposition of Yuletide cheer with the eerie and unsettling has always been a particular delight for me, and the various seasonal UK TV ghost stories that were produced over the years are still something I regularly return to for enjoyment and inspiration. Their simplicity of means and economy of style (however dictated by TV budgets) are still beautifully effective, and a lesson to all genre filmmakers that yes, less is often more. I can never hope to match them, but I'm very much looking forward to paying tribute to a form that has continually brought me so much pleasure/fear!”See the trailers for THE DEVIL'S BUSINESS and FUTURE SHOCK! THE STORY OF 2000AD below!Perks are unique added incentives to support the book now; they are free gifts you get with contributions of anything over the basic cost of the book - and some of them are pretty spectacular!Detailed images of the Greeting cards:Adam Juresko, SILENT NIGHT DEADLY NIGHTTrevor Henderson, TALES FROM THE DARKSIDE ""Seasons of Belief""Andrew Barr, GREMLINS: Gary Pullin, BLACK CHRISTMAS:Rick Trembles, CHRISTMAS EVIL:The funds raised here will go specifically toward the printing and manufacturing of the books, as well as a small budget for the production of the short film and other special perks. These pre-sales also ensure that we can pay artist fees – not only designer fees, but all contributors to the book receive royalties on every copy sold. Part of our goal with Spectacular Optical is to create a small but sustainable business that is able to pay artist fees to the many awesome (and often underpaid) writers and graphic artists working in our field, and to give them books they are proud of. Any writers who contributed to our last books, KID POWER!, SATANIC PANIC: POP-CULTURAL PARANOIA IN THE 1980s and LOST GIRLS: THE PHANTASMAGORICAL CINEMA OF JEAN ROLLIN can vouch for us on this count.In addition, as part of our crowdfunding campaigns, we often team up with like-minded organizations to offer their products in bundles with our own, acknowledging that collaboration between independent artists and companies keeps our small economy moving and allows us all to find an audience for our unique work.If we don't reach our goal, the book will still be printed and perks will still be delivered - the book is completely written and copy-edited, contracts have been signed, photographs have been sourced and the book is being laid out. We’re well on our way! But pre-sales through Indiegogo ensure the necessary cash flow to keep everything in the allotted timeline so that we can take advantage of promotional and sales opportunities through the holiday season. Our goal is to have the book ready and being mailed out to customers by the end of November 2017, where it will serve as the perfect Christmas gift, but we need sufficient pre-sales to meet that timeline - so if you want to give someone a copy of YULETIDE TERROR for Christmas, help us spread the word to reach our goal!YULETIDE TERROR will be a beautiful 6X9"", perfect-bound book, roughly 400 pages and heavily illustrated throughout with stills, posters, ads and other visual ephemera. It is a unique book in that it combines academic research with a pop-culture approach, offering a high standard of analytical insight while remaining accessible and comprehensive.In just a few short years, Spectacular Optical has garnered a reputation for making quality books that showcase underappreciated or under-examined aspects of pop culture - and we hope to make many more. This is the fourth book being published under my own imprint, and I have managed many projects at this scale - from running film festivals to operating my own microcinema. And aside from whatever skills, experience and connections we bring to the table (you can read our full bios below), we’ve also been mentored all along the way by the British cult film publisher FAB Press - so we have some good people on our side making sure we don’t fall. Kier-La Janisse is a film writer and programmer, Owner/Artistic Director of Spectacular Optical Publications and the founder of The Miskatonic Institute of Horror Studies, and has been a programmer for the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema and Fantastic Fest in Austin, Texas.

<h3><strong>Story of My Book</strong></h3>
<p><i>Every Step is a Gift: Caregiving, Endurance, and the Path to Gratitude </i>explores my eleven-year journey as a caregiver to my father while he battled Parkinson’s Disease. It’s the story of our relationship, the lessons I’ve learned, and my foray into ultra endurance biking and running.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>My name is Josh Lasky, and I am the author of <i>Every Step is a Gift</i>. I wrote this book because I feel like there are a lot of other people out there who are having or have had a similar experience to mine, and yet feel completely alone. According to AARP, 78% of people are currently caring for an aging family member or believe they will likely do so at some point in their life. That number is likely to increase, as more than 75 million baby boomers (born between 1946 and 1964) are currently planning their retirement. I didn’t know where to turn for support and inspiration when I chose to care for my ailing father, and like so many of us, I made it up as I went along. Now, on the other side of that journey, I’m certain that I would have benefitted from hearing the stories of others who were in a similar situation to mine.<br/><br/>My hope is that this book will bring conversations about caregiving, aging, and disability more into the mainstream. These topics are still far too uncomfortable for many people to share, but the more we can learn to embrace this natural progression of life, the more we’ll be able to make intentional decisions about ourselves and loved ones. I also hope that my readers will begin to find ways to shape their experiences as caregivers (or in any role struggling with an insurmountable challenge) to be positive and meaningful.<br/><br/>I’m grateful to have found a way to add meaning to my experience as I cared for my father. I was able to do this by cherishing the time that I had with him, while also focusing on my own physical and mental wellbeing through long-distance cycling and ultra running. In addition to detailed interactions with my father, the book highlights my 4,000-mile bike ride from Washington, DC to Portland, OR and my experience running my first races at the marathon, 50-mile, and 100-mile distance.<br/><br/>You’ll love this book if you’ve ever been a caregiver or if you’ve dealt with a really crappy situation and you’ve struggled to make the most out of it. You’ll love this story if you enjoy running or biking for exercise, for mediation, or for escape. You’ll love this story if you’ve ever had to face the disability, end-of-life planning, or death, of a loved one.<br/><br/><i>Every Step is a Gift</i> is a creative non-fiction book that speaks to caregivers, family members, and athletes who are navigating challenging relationships, while trying to maintain strength, meaning, and resilience.<br/> </p>
<h3>The Book - Every Step is a Gift: Caregiving, Endurance, and the Path to Gratitude</h3>The book is written in 3 Parts:<br/><br/>Part 1 introduces my father’s arrival and first year in Washington, DC where he lived near the campus of the university where I was attending grad school. It also discusses his transition to nursing care following a precipitous decline in his condition.<br/><br/>Part 2 details my father’s deep brain stimulation and recovery, as well as my broken ankle and surgeries required to repair it. This section also describes the cross-country bike ride I embarked on after rehabilitating my ankle.<br/><br/>Part 3 discusses my growing passion for ultrarunning against the backdrop of my father’s steady decline, including his transition to hospice care and his eventual death.<p> </p>

<br/>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you.

</div></div>","Story of My Book
Every Step is a Gift: Caregiving, Endurance, and the Path to Gratitude explores my eleven-year journey as a caregiver to my father while he battled Parkinson’s Disease. It’s the story of our relationship, the lessons I’ve learned, and my foray into ultra endurance biking and running.---My name is Josh Lasky, and I am the author of Every Step is a Gift. I wrote this book because I feel like there are a lot of other people out there who are having or have had a similar experience to mine, and yet feel completely alone. According to AARP, 78% of people are currently caring for an aging family member or believe they will likely do so at some point in their life. That number is likely to increase, as more than 75 million baby boomers (born between 1946 and 1964) are currently planning their retirement. I didn’t know where to turn for support and inspiration when I chose to care for my ailing father, and like so many of us, I made it up as I went along. Now, on the other side of that journey, I’m certain that I would have benefitted from hearing the stories of others who were in a similar situation to mine.My hope is that this book will bring conversations about caregiving, aging, and disability more into the mainstream. These topics are still far too uncomfortable for many people to share, but the more we can learn to embrace this natural progression of life, the more we’ll be able to make intentional decisions about ourselves and loved ones. I also hope that my readers will begin to find ways to shape their experiences as caregivers (or in any role struggling with an insurmountable challenge) to be positive and meaningful.I’m grateful to have found a way to add meaning to my experience as I cared for my father. I was able to do this by cherishing the time that I had with him, while also focusing on my own physical and mental wellbeing through long-distance cycling and ultra running. In addition to detailed interactions with my father, the book highlights my 4,000-mile bike ride from Washington, DC to Portland, OR and my experience running my first races at the marathon, 50-mile, and 100-mile distance.You’ll love this book if you’ve ever been a caregiver or if you’ve dealt with a really crappy situation and you’ve struggled to make the most out of it. You’ll love this story if you enjoy running or biking for exercise, for mediation, or for escape. You’ll love this story if you’ve ever had to face the disability, end-of-life planning, or death, of a loved one.Every Step is a Gift is a creative non-fiction book that speaks to caregivers, family members, and athletes who are navigating challenging relationships, while trying to maintain strength, meaning, and resilience. 
The Book - Every Step is a Gift: Caregiving, Endurance, and the Path to GratitudeThe book is written in 3 Parts:Part 1 introduces my father’s arrival and first year in Washington, DC where he lived near the campus of the university where I was attending grad school. It also discusses his transition to nursing care following a precipitous decline in his condition.Part 2 details my father’s deep brain stimulation and recovery, as well as my broken ankle and surgeries required to repair it. This section also describes the cross-country bike ride I embarked on after rehabilitating my ankle.Part 3 discusses my growing passion for ultrarunning against the backdrop of my father’s steady decline, including his transition to hospice care and his eventual death. 
What I Need & What You'll GetThis book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following: 
The editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in December 2020.
The cover design of my book (the mockups you see currently are a placeholder)
The layout design for the interior of my book (physical copy, ebook formats)
The copyediting for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication,
The launch and promotion efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this winter.

When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book ($5,000), I will publish. 
When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book ($6,000), I will also publish an audiobook. 
When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book ($8,000), I will publish a hardcover edition.
 I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now: 
You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish.
A personal, handwritten thank you note for pre-ordering my book.
Your name will appear in a special acknowledgements section of my book.
Early access to the introduction of my book and my entire manuscript, with the opportunity to review it and give me early feedback.
The opportunity to help give me feedback and be involved in selecting my cover.
An invitation to a book topic/workshop seminar where I will share the experiences of writing my book.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>UPDATE: The new issue can be downloaded at <a href=""http://www.roctober.rocks"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.roctober.rocks</a> and it is a whopping 128 pages! But because it is so big with so much color we need to raise a few more dollars! Out new goal is $3600, and if you order the limited hard copy you get exclusive trading crads.</p>
<p>Since he early 1990s Roctober Magazine has been one of the most passionate, thorough, absurd, densely packed, ridiculous music zines in the world, with brilliant, research-obsessed, generous writers covering obscure musicians in all genres. The zine also featuring some of the best graphic artists and cartoonists who ever lived. Roctober helps music fans around the globe discover lost superheroes of music, and those artists get the respect and honors they long-deserve by seeing their stories told accurately and joyfully. After a hiatus of more than 5 years the zine returns, now being published annually each October. A PDF of #52 will be released this Halloween followed by a very special limited edition print edition, which you can pre-order here in this funding campaign.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Because this is a crazy year (without the non-COVID stores and zine fests and record labels advertising and normal distribution) we are making this issue in a limited edition, so we will print based on pre-orders from this campaign and from local and indie vendors/distros. So your order determines how many we print, and the more orders we get determines how fancy we can print this (extra color, quality of paper, etcetera). If we only get a few orders this will still be cool - just more DIY-looking. But if we get a healthy amount of orders we can make this issue spectacular! So help us meet that goal of greatness.</p>

</p><p>Ok so here’s the deal…My name is Gina Tempesta, and I used
to be a news and traffic radio reporter in the Boston market for many years.
About six years ago, I was asked to do a community reading at one of my local
elementary schools. Naturally, being a traffic reporter at the time, I thought
it would be great to read a book about Boston’s historic Big Dig. But when I went to the
library to find a children’s book about the Big Dig there was none to be found.
That was when I decided to write one! </p>
<p>And that’s what I did! I spent the following two years
researching everything I could about the massive construction project. But what
I soon realized was that there was just too much information to write one book
and decided to divide it up into a series.</p>
<p>So here I am, looking for funding to help me illustrate and
publish the first book  - “Boston’s
Other Green Monster: A Story about the Big Dig.” </p>
<p>I am currently looking to raise at least $5,000 to help me to complete the illustrations and pay for part of the printing costs. Any additional funding t will be put in to helping me pay for improving
the BOGM website and to start the next book in the series, which will be about
the Zakim Bridge. Even if I do not reach my goal, every penny of my fundraising
will be put back into the book and the series.</p>
<p>I have spent the past three years reading the BOGM
manuscript to elementary children and they are truly interested and inspired by
the potential of this becoming a book. Your contribution will go a long way in helping me to bring this book
to life for children across the state. </p>
<p>I am grateful for any contribution large or small. If you do
contribute $40, you will be one of the first people to get a copy of the book once it is published this fall (eyes on November).
For $50, you will get a signed copy of BOGM directly from me.  For $,1000, you or your organization
will be considered a “sponsor” and will receive acknowledgement in the book. There
are also two perks for $750,  for this, I will travel to a location of your choice with Red
Sox’s mascot Wally the Green Monster to do a reading (dates TBD pending availability). </p>
<p>Even if you cannot help out with a monetary donation, please
help get the word out through by mouth, social media and the indiegogo share tool!</p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; background-color: initial;"">This is a really

African narratives are reinforced in popular and academic cultures, portraying Africa as ""The Dark Continent,"" a place of wildlife and horror. These limited narratives cannot tell the whole story of this rich and diverse continent.With our latest book, Uniting a Continent, Tsehai Publishers continues to dispel the dark myths cast over Africa. This book is the first of its kind, as it showcases the
founding of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and exemplifies the rich and unique cultural heritage of each African nation. Releasing this book now is crucial, as May 25th marks the end of the 50th Anniversary of the OAU. As we move into the 51st year, we ask you to join us in solidifying this historic moment by helping us publish this book.
Embrace ubuntu, join us in our mission, and donate today!
My name is Elias Wondimu, and I founded Tsehai Publishers in 1998. As a political exile from Ethiopia, my life's mission is to advocate freedom of expression as well as to tell the untold stories of Africa through the publication of literature. At Tsehai Publishers, we give a voice to African writers who would otherwise be unheard. Through these voices, we seek to combat the decades of misinformation and media bias that have reinforced the dehumanization of African people.Most people want to make the world a better place, and often times Africa becomes the focus of conversation. At Tsehai, we provide a different venue for change. Our mission is rooted in knowledge and empathy, only through true effort to educate can we go beyond popular narratives that show Africa as a helpless continent solely riddled with poverty. We ask you to support literature like this in order to change the dialogue from ""Dark Africa"" to an empowered and unified Africa. Uniting a Continent is a beautifully illustrated, first-of-its-kind historical book that profiles the past and present of the Organization of African Unity. We believe this book contributes to the telling of a necessary story, for we cannot understand and plan for Africa's future unless we appreciate the challenges and triumphs of the continent. The book's modern layout and engaging facts will appeal to a broad audience. Both children and adults will be able to pick up the book and learn new information that is difficult to find anywhere else. Content:
History of the Organization:  An overview of the OAU's history, which chronicles the lead up to its formation, to its inception, and to its successes in the last fifty years. This section includes historic speeches made at the organization's inception, the founding charter of the OAU, and a timeline of significant milestones during the organization's history.


Profiles of the OAU Leaders:  A compilation of celebratory biographies of the founding fathers of the OAU. The biographies are accompanied by beautiful illustrated portraits by commissioned artists.Some of the founding fathers featured in this book:
Profiles of Secretaries General:  Biographies of the secretaries general who served the OAU/AU in the last five decades, which also include beautifully illustrated portraits.
Historic Photographs:  A collection of photographs that capture the enthusiasm, passion, purpose, and action of a generation that came together to unite a continent.
OAU Member Country Profiles: Encyclopedic profiles of the member countries of the OAU/AU. Each profile depicts the country's map, flag, emblem, brief geographical information, and interesting facts about the country. It also presents the dates of independence, the dates the country joined the OAU/AU, and the names of the current head of state and head of government.In order to publish Uniting a Continent, we need your help in raising $30,000! This money will allow us to publish and market 1,000 copies. Thanks to our dedicated team at Tsehai Publishers, the book is ready to print, but without proper funds we will not be able to execute our mission. In exchange for your help in sowing the seeds of change and illuminating the myth of ""Dark Africa,"" we have some exciting perks to thank you for your support.We are indebted to every individual who helps raise awareness for Uniting a Continent.

<h2>Behind the Project ~ </h2>
<p>In January 2012 my husband and I saw a small dog living outside in the middle of winter.  We caught him and nursed him back to health. Over the following year we saw him slowly transform from an <em>extremely</em> shy, skittish dog into an energetic and cuddly member of the family. He has brought us endless joy. We named him Scrappy because that first night he was so dirty the name just seemed to fit. Scrappy started going to work with me every day. I am the Lead Social Worker with a non-profit organization in Boise, Idaho which provides housing and holistic services for homeless families with children.  <a href=""http://www.catchprogram.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.catchprogram.org</a></p>
<p>Scrappy became quite a hit with the homeless children our program serves.  At the office they looked for him to hug, give treats and play with.  I often used Scrappy to build a bridge with children who were hard to connect with or were having a tough day.  He brought an immediate comfort and smile to their face. </p>

<p>I watched many parallels emerge as I observed Scrappy’s transition from the streets to our home and as the homeless children I worked with moved from community shelters to their own home.  I realized Scrappy’s story would make a creative book that could relate with and encourage the families I work with and beyond. So, I started writing...</p>

<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 18.0pt; font-family: 'Times','serif';"">What Happened?</span></strong></p>
<p>On May 19<sup>th</sup> of this year, I was injured in an accident that nearly took my life. I slipped in leather moccasins in a mountain creek, falling and landing hard on a pyramid shaped rock. My femur exploded on impact, with bones cutting through muscles, veins, ligaments and tendons. Miraculously it missed my femoral artery, but stuck in a freezing cold creek, I couldn’t breath and began to blackout.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: .0001pt;"">As everything faded out, I could have easily closed my eyes and died there on the trail. But I looked over at Jessica, saw the look of fear and terror on her face, felt her heartache and KNEW I couldn’t die.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: .0001pt;"">And so I began FORCING myself to breathe. For two hours before being helicoptered out, I focused on my breath, bringing in sunlight, and breathing out love. These two things were the most powerful, soothing feelings and ideas I could think of, and they helped me get through.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: .0001pt;"">Though it was an incredibly scary time for both of us, it was also magical and transformational. Sitting next to a spouse who might die was life changing for Jessica. And for myself, stuck in the creek and focusing on my breath, my intuition instantly expanded. I began to get downloads of information that came in instantaneous packets, or what felt like little sparkles or glitters of information. Now each time I sit at my desk to write, one of those sparkles opens up into an entirely new concept, idea, or teaching I'd never thought of before. <span style=""""> </span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: .0001pt;""><strong><span style=""font-size: 18.0pt; font-family: 'Times','serif';"">Why the Accident was a Gift </span></strong></p>

<p>Even in the creek, we never said “poor me”, or “poor us”, or “why did this happen to me?” Instead, we accepted it as a gift, and a turning point in our lives. We knew we were shifting gears from teaching about the more physical side of life, to teaching the lessons we were now learning about the more spiritual side of life and how we can each overcome any challenges if only we believe.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: .0001pt;""><strong><span style=""font-size: 18.0pt; font-family: 'Times','serif';"">Two Loving Perspectives</span></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We feel we have to write this book, to share the love, gratitude, and healing power we found out there on the trail…and to share it from a couple’s point of view. Ultimately, I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for Jessica’s love and help to keep me alive and keep me going. This book is from both of our perspectives, mine, going through the physical pain and coming out the other side, and Jessica's, who's pain is more emotional, and more challenging in many ways. It’s a challenge for her to make the time to rest or step back, she always has to be there for me, a tireless job from the minute I slipped.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: .0001pt;""><strong><span style=""font-size: 18.0pt; font-family: 'Times','serif';"">What’s in It for You?</span></strong></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: .0001pt;"">This book will fill you with hope and inspiration, and help you to overcome any challenges you may have in life, whether that's physical, emotional, relational, financial, or spiritual. The lessons we’ve learned will lift your spirit and speak to your soul. For instance, we've learned that life's greatest challenges are opportunities for the miracles, miracles that are happening around us all of the time. In our case, getting injured was the best thing that ever happened to us. It helped us heal serious challenges and communication issues in our relationship, creating a new closeness and a much greater bond.</p>
<p>How precious and fragile and important life is, and how we must cherish each moment because we truly don't know how long we have here.</p>

Who We Are
Jessica and I (Michael Sandler) met at a meditation center after I looked up and said, “Oh, there she is!” Though I’d never met or seen her before, I knew I’d marry her. Until recently, we've never been apart.
Since that time we’ve started our own company, written best-selling books, and even produced a how-to movie. We’ve traveled the world working to help others, sharing our love and experiences along the way. Everything we’ve done has been about helping others to heal, overcome life's challenges, and find greater peace, happiness and joy.

What Happened?
On May 19th of this year, I was injured in an accident that nearly took my life. I slipped in leather moccasins in a mountain creek, falling and landing hard on a pyramid shaped rock. My femur exploded on impact, with bones cutting through muscles, veins, ligaments and tendons. Miraculously it missed my femoral artery, but stuck in a freezing cold creek, I couldn’t breath and began to blackout.
As everything faded out, I could have easily closed my eyes and died there on the trail. But I looked over at Jessica, saw the look of fear and terror on her face, felt her heartache and KNEW I couldn’t die.
And so I began FORCING myself to breathe. For two hours before being helicoptered out, I focused on my breath, bringing in sunlight, and breathing out love. These two things were the most powerful, soothing feelings and ideas I could think of, and they helped me get through.
Though it was an incredibly scary time for both of us, it was also magical and transformational. Sitting next to a spouse who might die was life changing for Jessica. And for myself, stuck in the creek and focusing on my breath, my intuition instantly expanded. I began to get downloads of information that came in instantaneous packets, or what felt like little sparkles or glitters of information. Now each time I sit at my desk to write, one of those sparkles opens up into an entirely new concept, idea, or teaching I'd never thought of before.  
 
Why the Accident was a Gift 

Even in the creek, we never said “poor me”, or “poor us”, or “why did this happen to me?” Instead, we accepted it as a gift, and a turning point in our lives. We knew we were shifting gears from teaching about the more physical side of life, to teaching the lessons we were now learning about the more spiritual side of life and how we can each overcome any challenges if only we believe.
 
The Book We Had to Write
So that’s what our book is about. Breathe Love shares the story of the accident, the pivotal events that led up to it, our healing journey and where it takes us. And it shares the lessons we’ve been learning; lessons we were ignoring before the accident, and new ones we gained there on the trail, each of which have been branded into our souls.
 
Two Loving Perspectives
 
We feel we have to write this book, to share the love, gratitude, and healing power we found out there on the trail…and to share it from a couple’s point of view. Ultimately, I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for Jessica’s love and help to keep me alive and keep me going. This book is from both of our perspectives, mine, going through the physical pain and coming out the other side, and Jessica's, who's pain is more emotional, and more challenging in many ways. It’s a challenge for her to make the time to rest or step back, she always has to be there for me, a tireless job from the minute I slipped.
 
What’s in It for You?
This book will fill you with hope and inspiration, and help you to overcome any challenges you may have in life, whether that's physical, emotional, relational, financial, or spiritual. The lessons we’ve learned will lift your spirit and speak to your soul. For instance, we've learned that life's greatest challenges are opportunities for the miracles, miracles that are happening around us all of the time. In our case, getting injured was the best thing that ever happened to us. It helped us heal serious challenges and communication issues in our relationship, creating a new closeness and a much greater bond.
How precious and fragile and important life is, and how we must cherish each moment because we truly don't know how long we have here.

<p>Radical

 Mycology is a movement and social philosophy based on accessibly teaching the importance of mushrooms and other fungi for personal, societal, and ecological 
health. Radical Mycology differs from classical mycology in that 
classical mycology generally focuses on taxonomy, identification, 
mycophagy (eating mushrooms), and the more personal benefits of working with fungi while Radical Mycology is about using fungi for the benefit of larger communities and the world.<br/><br/>As a concept, Radical Mycology is based on the belief that the lifecycles of fungi and their interactions in nature serve as powerful learning tools for how humans can better 
relate to each other and steward the world they live in.<br/><br/>As an
 organization, the Radical Mycology project organizes the Radical Mycology Convergences (see below) and disseminates free literature
 and other media on the uses of fungi for food sovereignty, medicine 
creation, ecological restoration, mycopermaculture, 
community building, and creating resilient/sustainable lifestyles. The Radical Mycology project started in 2006.</p>

<p>The

 Radical Mycology project began as an idea between two friends (<a href=""http://radicalmycology.wordpress.com/about/who-we-are/mayas-bio/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Maya</a> and
 <a href=""http://radicalmycology.wordpress.com/about/who-we-are/peters-bio/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Peter</a>) 7 years ago when they met while working on volunteer 
projects related to ecological and social justice. Weaving the seemingly
 unrelated fields of 
mycology, environmental justice, systems theory, and social organizing 
together, the concept of Radical Mycology was born. Realizing that the importance of fungal
 ecology was missing from many environmental justice dialogues, the two developed a novel perspective on applied science. On all levels, it seemed, the fungi exemplified many successful and sustainable models that human activity can actively learn from.<br/></p>
<p>In time, Peter wrote a zine (or booklet/pamphlet) entitled <a href=""http://radicalmycology.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/slf-final-1-1.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Radical Mycology</a> that encapsulated their ideas. The zine quickly became quite popular and the positive feedback it received eventually inspired Maya and Peter to organize the first, second, and upcoming third <a href=""http://radicalmycologyconvergence.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Radical Mycology Convergences (RMCs</a>). Modeled after the networked and collaborative structure of mushroom mycelium, the RMCs are donation-based events that teach the skills of low-cost mushroom cultivation and bioremediation while building a supportive community of like-minded mushroom enthusiasts and environmental justice supporters.</p>
<p>The two also run the website <a href=""http://www.radicalmycology.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">radicalmycology.com</a>, where free resources and literature are provided to both educate the world on the benefits of fungi but to also <a href=""http://radicalmycology.wordpress.com/about/radical-mycolgists-near-you/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">foster a community</a> of passionate mycophiles around the globe.

the ideas and insights of those who have allied with us along the way. We do
 not see this idea as ours, but something that should and will 
inevitably grow of its own. Radical Mycology is not just about pushing one perspective, it is 
about creating a paradigm shift in the relationship most people (at 
least in the West) have with fungi from one of fear and misunderstanding to 
one of appreciation, respect, and allyship.<br/><h3></h3>

Radical Mycology: The theory and practice of using mushrooms and other fungi to create positive personal, societal, and ecological change.
Peter McCoy is a co-founder of the Radical Mycology project and co-organizer of the Radical Mycology Convergences. He has been studying mycology (the 
science of fungi) for over 12 years and is currently pursuing a dual degree in Media and Mycology at the Evergreen State College in Olympia, WA. He is a cultivation and remediation instructor, community organizer, illustrator, author, street medic, 
zinester, and lover of the great outdoors. Peter
 has written and produced several publications and videos on mycology, 
mushroom cultivation and mycoremediation. When he is not teaching cultivation courses in Olympia and abroad, Peter spends much of his time writing, making art, and coordinating a volunteer mushroom cultivation group in Olympia, WA that provides free mushroom gardens and installations to 
the Olympia community to teach about the benefits of fungi as food, medicine, and remediators.

Radical

 Mycology is a movement and social philosophy based on accessibly teaching the importance of mushrooms and other fungi for personal, societal, and ecological 
health. Radical Mycology differs from classical mycology in that 
classical mycology generally focuses on taxonomy, identification, 
mycophagy (eating mushrooms), and the more personal benefits of working with fungi while Radical Mycology is about using fungi for the benefit of larger communities and the world.As a concept, Radical Mycology is based on the belief that the lifecycles of fungi and their interactions in nature serve as powerful learning tools for how humans can better 
relate to each other and steward the world they live in.As an
 organization, the Radical Mycology project organizes the Radical Mycology Convergences (see below) and disseminates free literature
 and other media on the uses of fungi for food sovereignty, medicine 
creation, ecological restoration, mycopermaculture, 
community building, and creating resilient/sustainable lifestyles. The Radical Mycology project started in 2006.
To learn more about the Radical Mycology, visit the project's website here. To read the Radical Mycology project's mission statement and goals, click here.



The

 Radical Mycology project began as an idea between two friends (Maya and
 Peter) 7 years ago when they met while working on volunteer 
projects related to ecological and social justice. Weaving the seemingly
 unrelated fields of 
mycology, environmental justice, systems theory, and social organizing 
together, the concept of Radical Mycology was born. Realizing that the importance of fungal
 ecology was missing from many environmental justice dialogues, the two developed a novel perspective on applied science. On all levels, it seemed, the fungi exemplified many successful and sustainable models that human activity can actively learn from.
In time, Peter wrote a zine (or booklet/pamphlet) entitled Radical Mycology that encapsulated their ideas. The zine quickly became quite popular and the positive feedback it received eventually inspired Maya and Peter to organize the first, second, and upcoming third Radical Mycology Convergences (RMCs). Modeled after the networked and collaborative structure of mushroom mycelium, the RMCs are donation-based events that teach the skills of low-cost mushroom cultivation and bioremediation while building a supportive community of like-minded mushroom enthusiasts and environmental justice supporters.
The two also run the website radicalmycology.com, where free resources and literature are provided to both educate the world on the benefits of fungi but to also foster a community of passionate mycophiles around the globe. There you can also find the new free Radical Mycology publication, Mushroom Cultivation for Remediation, and its associated 3-part instructional video.

This Indiegogo campaign will fund the 
next big step in the Radical Mycology project: funding the 
production of a book on the theory, practice, and applications of using mushrooms and other fungi to create positive personal, social, and ecological
 change. This book will be similar in design and flow to the Radical Mycology zine, but the toolbox of mycological skills and philosophical 
insights it will provide will be of much greater breadth and depth for those seeking to use fungi to make the world a better 
place.The book will be visually compelling while serving as an educational 
resource guide at times and a philosophical call to embrace the fungi as
 allies at other times. The Radical 
Mycology Book will not only include step-by-step instructions for 
mushrooms cultivation and applications in everyday life but will also be a
 resource for creating a paradigm shift in the western culture's 
understanding of the fungal kingdom. The book will provide an entertaining and educational view into the mysterious, dense, and uncommon
 world of mushrooms and mycology, all explained by using
 accessible language, photographs, illustrations, and 
vivid metaphors.Highlighted sections in the book include:
Practical
 mushroom cultivation with ways to make your own tools and equipment, 
alternative & low-tech techniques, and using high tech methods on a 
small budget.
Applications of fungi for perpetual food systems, permaculture, and land stewardship.
The theory and practice of mycoremediation 
including step-by-step guides to training a mushroom to digest a given 
pollutant, disaster protocols, and an explanation of the chemistry

Two mushrooms inspired games: a field game and a tabletop role playing game, designed by Jackson Tegu.
Original art, charts, and diagrams.
Much more!

The

 book is estimated to be at least 400 pages once complete but may very 
well exceed that goal. It is projected to be finished and published by 
the summer of 2014. The book will be paperback and mainly 
black and white, with a color plate center section. Contributors will 
receive regular 
updates on the progress of the book as it develops.The $18,000 goal set for this 
campaign will not only fund the book's printing & distribution, it will also fund a Radical Mycology tour
 in North America for late 2014 when the book comes out. Once the book is published, a percentage of 
the profits from the book will go toward a fund to support independent
remediation research and installation projects around the world.The $18,000 goal for this book is broken down into three main categories:Overhead
Indiegogo's cut + IRS taxes: $4,000
Creating and shipping campaign non-book perks: estimated at $1,000
Stipend - Peter will be working full time on the book for 6-9 months. This stipend will help cover his modest living expenses during that time: $3,000


Publishing
Cooperative Publishing Company formation and legal organization: $1,000
Developmental and Copy editing: $1,000
Printing (depending on demand and ultimate book length): estimated at $2,500
ISBN Securement: $500


Marketing & Distribution
Online and Print promotion (pre and post campaign): $1,000

A
 2-3 month road show of the US and Canada in the summer of 2014 to talk about the book, hold workshops (with RM contributors and affiliated colleagues), and build a Radical Mycology community. This 
will include gas and other transportation fees, food, promotion, and 
venue rental fees. We will be relying on friends, associates, and fellow
 mycophiles to host us along the way to help cut costs. This will likely
 take up the remaining money. 
E-Book Conversion: $250

Warehousing and distribution: $1,000



If we surpass our $18,000 minimum goal we have the following stretch goals to make this project even more awesome and to extend the Radical Mycology values and build community around the world:
All
 of the Radical Mycology tour will be documented and will become part of
 a Radical Mycology documentary as a part of a future crowdfunding 
campaign.Anything beyond these goals will fund the translation of the Radical Mycology Book into other languages.
All donors will receive regular updates on the progress of the book. These emails will include links to interesting articles and resources on the books topics, video updates and how-to's from the author, and sneak previews of the book's art and designs.
The perks listed on the side bar describe what the different donation tiers will receive. Of special note are the following items:
A mushroom cultivation beginner pack - This cultivation starter kit will include the following items to begin applying the cultivation skills found in the Radical Mycology book:
Blank petri dish (1)

60mL syringe and 16ga needle (1 each)

Mushroom spawn grow bags (5)

Airport injection lids (2)

Falcon test tubes (5)

Parafilm strip (5)


 Mushroom species uses and cultivation requirements reference chart - A cross reference poster listing over 30 fungal species, their cultivation requirements, cooking/preserving tips, medicinal value, uses in the garden, uses for rehabilitating damaged environments, and more.
Mushroom cultivation course - This course is the same that Peter has taught multiple times in the US and Canada, typically for $200 per person. Covering the theory, practice, and applications of mushroom cultivation this course covers many of the topics included in the Radical Mycology book in a hands-on approach. Donors will be able to invite up to 29 other people to join the course. However, if donors choose to charge for it, they will not be permitted to charge more than $200 per person (this is to keep this information relatively cheap and accessible for those that need it). Backers will be responsible for promotion of the course and venue rental. These courses will be scheduled to take place during the Radical Mycology road show during the summer of 2014. Subject matter and myco-installations done during the courses can be custom tailored to donor needs.
This book is also unique in its approach
 to mycology. This book emphasizes the simplest, cheapest, and more 
appropriate and practical applications of mycology to many aspects of 
daily life, both for individuals and larger communities. This book will explore fungi of all types, from symbiotic mycorrhizal and endophtic species, to molds that ferment foods, to lichens, to the familiar 3-D fruitbodies we call mushrooms. As the topic list above shows, the book will also show the many practical and useful ways that fungi can be used in everyday life. This book will provide the means to make these skills accessible to all. The Radical Mycology book will be filled with illustrations and 
graphics to best depict abstract concepts and challenging skills thus 
providing a visual language for developing a grassroots mycological 
community.We believe that this book will provide a one-stop resource 
for diving into the world of mycology and we think the Radical Mycology
 project is in a 
special place to produce such a book due to the resources we have 
available to us. Over the years, the Radical Mycology project 
has built a rather large network of expert mycologists and advisers 
along with a supportive community of like-minded mushroom lovers and 
environmental justice advocates. In writing this book, we will not only 
provide our perspectives as the founders of the Radical Mycology project but also include 
the ideas and insights of those who have allied with us along the way. We do
 not see this idea as ours, but something that should and will 
inevitably grow of its own. Radical Mycology is not just about pushing one perspective, it is 
about creating a paradigm shift in the relationship most people (at 
least in the West) have with fungi from one of fear and misunderstanding to 
one of appreciation, respect, and allyship.
Beyond contributing to this campaign financially, there are several great
 ways you can help promote this project to your friends and networks:Social (Mycelial) Networking:Please link and share this project on any social networks you are on!Here is a short link to this campaign for easy linking:http://igg.me/at/radmyco""Like"" Radical Mycology on Facebook:

contact him through Indiegogo to set up an interview.

Several perks have additional shipping costs for backers outside the US. These rates were based on the average costs of shipping to several countries. Canadian rates are slightly less.

<h3>BONJOUR</h3>
<p>Je m'appelle Laetitia, j'ai 29 ans et je suis passionnée par la psychologie et l'humain. J'ai pour but de créer des ateliers de développement personnel par le biais de la PNL : aider les gens à avoir un regard plus positif sur la vie, les aider à atteindre leurs objectifs et à trouver les clés qui les rendront heureux. Cela me tient très à coeur c'est un rêve pour moi de pouvoir organiser ces ateliers, je sens que je suis faite pour ça, il n'y a que ça qui me passionne.</p>
<p>Une fois ma formation terminée, je m'engage en échange de votre contribution à vous inviter à participer à mes ateliers et aux séances de coaching en toute gratuité pendant  6 mois, et par la suite à prendre gratuitement 2 personnes par mois en coaching ; et 5 places gratuites aux ateliers.</p>
<p>Mon objectif final serait de faire de cette activité mon unique métier, et donc de pouvoir en vivre. Mais aussi de faire bénéficier de mes compétences aux personnes qui ne pourront se permettre de se payer un coach ou un stage, c'est pour cela que je compte axer cette activité professionelle en 2 parties:  une partie avec stages et séances de coaching à mon compte, et une partie en bénévolat pour les personnes qui éprouvent des difficultés financières.</p>

NAMI received top ratings by both CharityNavigator.org, CharityWatch.org and is accredited by the Better Business Bureau.  Through writing this book I've come to sympathize immensely with the issues NAMI addresses.  I am proud to put my creativity to work for such a laudable cause and I hope to inspire others in some small way.  Though the tribute is now small, its potential to reach larger audiences and pass on a positive message gets bigger with your support! <br/><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><p></p>

The King of the Sun is a compelling psychological drama following the life of Cinder Slade, a genius solar-energy engineer and mastermind of a billion-dollar company, and his devoted, every-girl assistant, Colleen King.  As Colleen begins to understand her employer, she realizes that he is not the face that he presents to the public.  Cinder's facade is both his haven and his prison, and as colleagues, clients, friends and family break in, the foundations of his life and lies begin to crumble.  Colleen is desperate to protect her kind, inspiring friend from the cruel, careless attacks of his coworkers, family, the media and, most of all, himself.   
The King of the Sun is a finished, 398-pg novel soon to be self-published via Kindle, Nook and Lulu.com.  The crowdfunding campaign is to give it the best start possible, addressing the areas listed below.  Read the first chapter here (see the ""Gallery"" tag above) or find out more about Cinder and Colleen, the book and the cause on The King of the Sun website

Though KotS is a work of fiction, the struggles it illustrates--depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, abuse and others--are a reality for millions of people.  In this way, KotS is more than a self-published novel.  As a dedication to the real-life situations and, often, tragedies that parallel the book, all author's proceeds post-crowdfunding from sales on Amazon, Barnes and Nobel and Lulu.com will be donated to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) ""the nation's largest grassroots mental health organization dedicated to building better lives for the millions of Americans affected by mental illness."" NAMI received top ratings by both CharityNavigator.org, CharityWatch.org and is accredited by the Better Business Bureau.  Through writing this book I've come to sympathize immensely with the issues NAMI addresses.  I am proud to put my creativity to work for such a laudable cause and I hope to inspire others in some small way.  Though the tribute is now small, its potential to reach larger audiences and pass on a positive message gets bigger with your support!

<p>The Amazigh people are the indigenous people of North Africa and live in countries like Algeria, Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, and Tunisia. The Amazigh race is comprised of a multitude of ethnic groups from the Berber, Tuaregs, Imuhagh, Zuwaras, Zenetas, Tlemcen Berbers, Siwi, Shawiya, Riffians, Nafusis, Mozabites, Matmata, Kabyles, Djerba, Chenoui, Chenini &amp; Douiret, Chlouhs, Chaoui, Brabers, Blida and Gaunches.</p>
<p>Most of the Amazigh populations live in sheer poverty and some live in war-laden countries around the continent of Africa.</p>
<h3>OUR INSPIRATION.</h3>
<p>I'm Khedidja Ouheb, a scholar, a non-profit employee, a wife, a contributor, an author and a full-time Executive MBA student. I am currently employed by a non-profit organization in Northern Virginia as an Orphan Program Coordinator. This campaign and work is very important to me, being of Amazigh heritage myself, to raise awareness about the Amazigh people and keep our culture, traditions, and way of life alive for future generations to come.</p>
<h3>OUR WORK.</h3>
<p>We are raising funds to launch our non-profit the <strong>Amazigh Heritage Foundation</strong> and kick off the first of many programs. Amazigh Heritage Foundation will be a non-profit that educates and raises awareness on the indigenous culture of the Amazigh people, helping them to improve and thrive in a better environment. Our goals are to promote, protect, and share the cultural heritage of the indigenous Amazigh populations through <strong>ADVOCACY, CULTURAL PRESERVATION, CROSS-CULTURAL EXCHANGE, EDUCATIONAL EVENTS, and HUMANITARIAN RELIEF. </strong></p>
<p>We are asking for your support to keep the Amazigh Heritage and the Amazigh people alive and assist us in making this common dream of an indigenous people come to fruition.</p>
<h3>""THE LEGEND OF ARKATAK"" BOOK PROJECT.</h3>
<p>The first project we are launching under the Amazigh Heritage Foundation is publishing the book <strong>""The Legend of Arkatak,""</strong> <strong>a folktale rooted in Amazigh history and traditions.</strong> This tale was passed from generation to generation from mouth to ear amongst the Berbers of the desert, which are also known as the Tuareg or blue men of the desert and we would like to share it with <strong>YOU and a LARGER AUDIENCE.</strong></p>
<p>The protagonist is Arkatak, a handicapped boy who goes through many obstacles of life as he grows up to become the strongest man in the world, eventually becoming immortal. Arkatak was born handicapped from a woman that was a beggar at day and a demon at night. His father was a king that eventually died too soon before Arkatak grew up.</p>
<p>Arkatak finds himself on the streets with his mother in a very desperate situation. They both go through many heartaches, problems and financial difficulties. Although Arkatak goes through the hardest moments in his life. It is within these hardest moments that he finds his true inner strength and eventually shines. Through multiple stages, trials, tribulations, one harder than the other one, he transforms himself to become one of the strongest force to ever exist in the universe.</p>
<p>The legend of Arkatak is a book that will give hope and strength to its readers, showing them that amid the worst scenarios life can bring, and out of utter chaos, can come out success and the potential for a better life. From that angle, this is what Amazigh Heritage Foundation will do to its best, to bring light on this obscure indigenous culture lost between, time, space and poverty on the continent of Africa.</p>
<p>This is a quick quote left by an Amazigh man after an epiphany <em>""I am proud of you my ancestor ""Massinissa"" you glorious king of the Berbers. If only you knew what happened to your country. Where the majority of your progeny have forgotten their origins and their culture, and they have even insulted their origins. They have adopted a foreign language that originates from a land that is far, far away from our land ""thousands of miles.""""</em></p>
<h3>YOUR SUPPORT. </h3>
<p><strong>With your much needed help, this campaign will contribute to the launch of the Amazigh Heritage Foundation and our first program--publishing ""The Legend of Arkatak.""</strong></p>
<p>The first $10,000 raised will cover the completion costs for ""The Legend of Arkatak."" The funds will go to support hiring a professional editing firm, creating the artwork design and layout for the front and back book covers, and, lastly, printing hard copies of the book.</p>
<p>Once we officially release the final copy of ""The Legend of Arkatak"" on the market, it will be sold in both eBook and hard copy format and funds raised from the sale of the book will be reinvested to sustain the Amazigh Heritage Foundation.</p>
<p>The remaining $20,000 of funds raised through this campaign will help us launch the non-profit by covering operational and programming costs. We will design and launch a website for Amazigh Heritage Foundation, which will be an educational resource for Amazigh Heritage, and launch additional programs.</p>

You found me! I’m Becca. I’m a speculative fiction author, a poet, an editor, a grad student at CalArts, an artist, a costumer.</p><p>You can <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/send-becca-to-clarion/edit/rebeccaannjordan.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">read more about me here</a>.</p><p>And I’m super excited to tell you that I’ve been accepted to attend the 2015 Clarion Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Writers’ Workshop at UCSD!</p><p>[cue squealing with delight]</p><p><b>What is Clarion?</b></p><p>Clarion one of the best six-week-long workshop during the summer for writers of short science fiction and fantasy. Every year, they invite six superfamous, superpublished, superawesome instructors and about 18 students of up-and-coming-ness to learn from the best. You can <a href=""http://clarion.ucsd.edu/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">read more about them here</a>.</p><p><b>My Work</b></p><p>For the past three years, I’ve dedicated myself completely to the study of fiction. Yes, often sci-fi and fantasy. Ghost stories and monsters. Doomed love and voices from another realm. I love talking with authors about their work, workshopping, critiquing and editing. Seriously, I don’t have a life.</p><p>I’ve sold fifteen short stories, flash fictions, and poems. You can <a href=""http://www.rebeccaannjordan.com/publications/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">read some of them here for free</a>.</p><p>I firmly believe that science fiction and fantasy is not only fun to read, but is crucial to understanding our world. It helps us gain distance and insight on our fantasies, fears, and frustrations in order to deal with them in in RL (what we cave-dwelling writers call Real Life).</p><p>I personally love exploring the dark “what ifs?” that speculative fiction makes possible. What if you swallow a pit and it really does grow a tree in your belly? What if people continued to speak even after they died? What if there’s a thing called bugshot and you can use it as a biological weapon against your enemies?!?! <i>Wouldn’t that be awesome?!</i></p><p>Ahem. Anyway.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1277290/files/20150308002719-March.jpg?1425803239"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>What I’ll Do at Clarion</b></p><p>I applied to Clarion UCSD with the explicit intention of working on a book of related short stories. For this book, I began with a long short story set in an old world almost like ours, but with one huge difference: there is no distinction between what is animal, what is plant, and what is human. I plan to continue writing stories in this world, the book to be finished, with any luck, by mid-2016.</p><p>I’m also so excited to draft new stories, putting form to new ideas and just generally feeding off of the lifeforce out of my classmates and instructors. Less of a vampire thing, more of a symbiotic-birds-feeding-off-the-detritus-of-a-rhinoceros-back thing. That's a metaphor that people use, right?</p><p><b>I Need Your Help</b></p><p>Here’s the part where I ask you for money.</p><p>I need your help to get to Clarion. The tuition cost is about $5,000 for six weeks of intensive, high-level work in the field that I love. That includes housing and some meals.</p><p>Today I’m just asking for $2,600 to cover anything I’m not able to.</p><p>The good souls at The Clarion Foundation were very generous awarding me a scholarship. However, I’m currently pursuing my Master in Fine Arts from California Institute of the Arts, and am doing most of that on loans. I hold two part-time jobs, and I will be paying out of my savings (from that short-lived bout with a full-time job), but I simply don’t have enough to cover the cost on my own.</p><p>That’s where you come in.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1363979/files/20150407165539-newsletterapril.jpg?1428450939"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>Perks</b></p><p>If you help me out, I’ll make it worth your while. *eyebrow waggle*</p><p>There are some supercool perks I’m offering to the right:</p><ul>

You found me! I’m Becca. I’m a speculative fiction author, a poet, an editor, a grad student at CalArts, an artist, a costumer.You can read more about me here.And I’m super excited to tell you that I’ve been accepted to attend the 2015 Clarion Science Fiction & Fantasy Writers’ Workshop at UCSD![cue squealing with delight]What is Clarion?Clarion one of the best six-week-long workshop during the summer for writers of short science fiction and fantasy. Every year, they invite six superfamous, superpublished, superawesome instructors and about 18 students of up-and-coming-ness to learn from the best. You can read more about them here.My WorkFor the past three years, I’ve dedicated myself completely to the study of fiction. Yes, often sci-fi and fantasy. Ghost stories and monsters. Doomed love and voices from another realm. I love talking with authors about their work, workshopping, critiquing and editing. Seriously, I don’t have a life.I’ve sold fifteen short stories, flash fictions, and poems. You can read some of them here for free.I firmly believe that science fiction and fantasy is not only fun to read, but is crucial to understanding our world. It helps us gain distance and insight on our fantasies, fears, and frustrations in order to deal with them in in RL (what we cave-dwelling writers call Real Life).I personally love exploring the dark “what ifs?” that speculative fiction makes possible. What if you swallow a pit and it really does grow a tree in your belly? What if people continued to speak even after they died? What if there’s a thing called bugshot and you can use it as a biological weapon against your enemies?!?! Wouldn’t that be awesome?!Ahem. Anyway.What I’ll Do at ClarionI applied to Clarion UCSD with the explicit intention of working on a book of related short stories. For this book, I began with a long short story set in an old world almost like ours, but with one huge difference: there is no distinction between what is animal, what is plant, and what is human. I plan to continue writing stories in this world, the book to be finished, with any luck, by mid-2016.I’m also so excited to draft new stories, putting form to new ideas and just generally feeding off of the lifeforce out of my classmates and instructors. Less of a vampire thing, more of a symbiotic-birds-feeding-off-the-detritus-of-a-rhinoceros-back thing. That's a metaphor that people use, right?I Need Your HelpHere’s the part where I ask you for money.I need your help to get to Clarion. The tuition cost is about $5,000 for six weeks of intensive, high-level work in the field that I love. That includes housing and some meals.Today I’m just asking for $2,600 to cover anything I’m not able to.The good souls at The Clarion Foundation were very generous awarding me a scholarship. However, I’m currently pursuing my Master in Fine Arts from California Institute of the Arts, and am doing most of that on loans. I hold two part-time jobs, and I will be paying out of my savings (from that short-lived bout with a full-time job), but I simply don’t have enough to cover the cost on my own.That’s where you come in.PerksIf you help me out, I’ll make it worth your while. *eyebrow waggle*There are some supercool perks I’m offering to the right:
You can get ebooks, signed print books, or a White Elephant gift.
I love editing and have been editing part-time for about four years. I’m offering short story critiques and manuscript critiques for those writerly types out there.
There’s some awesome handmade items I’d love to customize for you--cloaks, for example.
Art prints!
You can even get me to write you a customized story all your very own!
May the odds be ever in your favor!Last but not least, you’ll get my eternal gratitude and a big I-O-U.If you want books or any handmade item, be sure to let me know on checkout which book, which color, etc. If you leave it blank, I’ll pick out something cool for you :)Thank You!If you can’t donate right now, I totally understand. Please share with your friends, especially those who love reading science fiction and fantasy!Thanks so much for sticking around (and putting up with that video). This is a huge step in my career and I'm so glad you're taking this journey with me. I’m feeling warmly toward you all at the moment.And so does the entire Writing Muse Team.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

</b></p><p>Flowers kick-started my collaboration as a poet with gifted painters on a
project called <i>A Hundred Poems About
Flowers. </i>Together we're exploring
the wonders &amp; quirks of our human relationship with blossoms of all kinds.
We're doing this through 4 public exhibitions of paintings, poem text, and poem
audio, which we then publish as full-colour illustrated books and audio cds.</p>
<br/>
<p>Two years ago exhibit one &amp; book one: <i>A Hundred Poems About Flowers - the first twenty-five </i>
came off beautifully. Visual artists for<i> </i>this first in a series of four books<i> </i>were Oxford County
painter Rita Milton and Woodstock, Ontario landscape painter Cathy Groulx. The month-long exhibition took place at the Ingersoll Creative Arts Centre (Ontario) followed by the publication of book one.</p><p><br/></p><p>The first exhibit and book came about through contributions (many in-kind) from over a dozen individuals. Other resources were generously supplied by community organizations who saw the worth in what began as a very ""local"" project. In the process we we discovered that because flowers are universal, our ""local"" project quickly proved itself valuable to anyone, anywhere.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span><br/></p>

Your support of this campaign will create a rich addition to our cultural celebrations (and contemplations) of flowers, nature, gardening and gardeners. Through  poetry, paintings and sound, A Hundred Poems About Flowers - the next twenty-five will explore common cottage garden flowers and indigenous wildflowers. 
As the project's poet and creator I write of flowers to bear witness. To contemplate the experiences of gardening. To celebrate wildflowers and reflect on a time when they were familiar and common even in farmland. In the process this project also sometimes offers notes on Nature as we're allowing it to be erased without a peep of protest: certain of these poems are hymns to wild blooms which even as I write are falling to Development. 
In the Beginning...




Flowers kick-started my collaboration as a poet with gifted painters on a
project called A Hundred Poems About
Flowers. Together we're exploring
the wonders & quirks of our human relationship with blossoms of all kinds.
We're doing this through 4 public exhibitions of paintings, poem text, and poem
audio, which we then publish as full-colour illustrated books and audio cds.

Two years ago exhibit one & book one: A Hundred Poems About Flowers - the first twenty-five 
came off beautifully. Visual artists for this first in a series of four books were Oxford County
painter Rita Milton and Woodstock, Ontario landscape painter Cathy Groulx. The month-long exhibition took place at the Ingersoll Creative Arts Centre (Ontario) followed by the publication of book one.The first exhibit and book came about through contributions (many in-kind) from over a dozen individuals. Other resources were generously supplied by community organizations who saw the worth in what began as a very ""local"" project. In the process we we discovered that because flowers are universal, our ""local"" project quickly proved itself valuable to anyone, anywhere.What We Need & What You Get

Your financial support will go directly to the
production costs of A Hundred Poems About Flowers - the next twenty-five 
- 


photographing the twenty-five paintings for the book 
the creation of audio kits for exhibit visitors to listen to
     while they stroll through the exhibit and admire the artwork 
exhibit mounts 
sound engineering 
gallery rental 
printing of the full-colour illustrated poetry book 


Even if we don't meet our financial goal of
$3500, all proceeds will greatly assist to offset production costs. 
On the sidebar you'll see a list of perks you receive as contributor to this campaign.We recognize that funds are tight - especially among artists - and would appreciate it if you shared this campaign on your social media sites.

Show me the flower of heart's success
when brain only wants to be loved
  shy white
parachute, still, 
in the fork of opposing stems.

head leans to earth and hidden roots
whispers Love me

<br/><b>2. A CAREER STUDYING IDEAS &amp; THE HISTORY OF TREND HUNTER </b><br/>I spent my life searching for a business idea that I could call my own.After decades of searching, I still didn't have that idea, but I had become an expert helping OTHER people find their inspiration.  In my mad quest to find an opportunity, I'd become one of the youngest business directors and innovation leads at a bank, where I eventually grew my business line into a $1 billion portfolio of market leading products.  That sounds great, but for me, the corporate success was a glowing reminder that I hadn't solved my entrepreneurial goal.

THE BACKGROUND STORY

150,000 Hunters + 100,000,000 Visitors + 350 Clients = A More Proven Path to Unstoppable Ideas

1. CONTEXT: WE HELP PEOPLE FIND BETTER IDEAS FASTER Trend Hunter is on a crowd-sourced, crowd-filtered mission to help people ""Find Better Ideas Faster.""  As a giant community of curious and creative people around the world, we've had the ability to study ideas in a very unique way that was never before possible.  Imagine having 150,000 people hunting ideas for you and a 100,000,000 person focus group.   In short, this book represents millions of dollars of research and nearly 7 years of work with our global team and work advising several hundred brands from Samsung and Nestle to Adidas and Victoria's Secret.
2. A CAREER STUDYING IDEAS & THE HISTORY OF TREND HUNTER I spent my life searching for a business idea that I could call my own.After decades of searching, I still didn't have that idea, but I had become an expert helping OTHER people find their inspiration.  In my mad quest to find an opportunity, I'd become one of the youngest business directors and innovation leads at a bank, where I eventually grew my business line into a $1 billion portfolio of market leading products.  That sounds great, but for me, the corporate success was a glowing reminder that I hadn't solved my entrepreneurial goal. So, I started a crowd sourced website where people from around the world could share business ideas.  I thought that someone, somewhere, would share an idea that could inspire my great idea.  In the years that followed, I am humbled and grateful that Trend Hunter exploded into something much larger with 2 BILLION pageviews, millions of fans and 100,000,000 visitors, each teaching us about the future.
3. WHAT HAPPENED AFTER EXPLOITING CHAOS (WRITTEN IN 2008)In 2008, I wrote a book called Exploiting Chaos which won a number of business awards (Inc Magazine Best Books for Business Owners, Axiom International Book Award - Gold Medal, CEO Read #1 Most Popular, etc).   Published a year later, the book turned out to be a pretty timely read as the world entered a 6 year period of chaos and uncertainty that we are still a part of.  This expertise led me to become an advisor for about 350 brands, billionaires and a lot of CEOs who wanted to help their teams better navigate chaos and change.  By helping those companies during their most difficult periods of change, my team has had a remarkable opportunity to battle test and prove our approach to change and adaptation.  We've been through a lot of companies in their periods of change and we know these methods will help your team adapt and find better ideas faster.
** NOTE: You'll get all of the Exploiting Chaos extras free, with any of the book packages.

In short, we want to help accelerate your potential and teach you how to see all those close ideas that you are overlooking. We want to make you BETTER & FASTER, which will take your game to the next level:",21.0,2,"1 Campaign

We are aiming our project at young people, the same age as us, we want to get out there, talk about youth issues that are relevant to our age group, spread the word about local bands, music, events, places to go, things to do and whilst we do that we want to share people's stories. We want to show people how positive young people round here can be.... and we want to do it in a creative, engaging way. We want our magazine to look the business, we want our own local radio station and our own YouTube channel, we want to make it onto the local news and local TV and aim even higher- we want to go national!</p>
<p>The Creative Youth Organisation we work with is a not for profit, they have years of experience working with young people just like us. The staff there have worked with young people.... like forever and the people from Now East Durham know their stuff too so we know we are well supported.</p>
<p>Once we have our magazine up and running we know we can cover costs with relevant, youth focused advertising so we only need the money to get us started! Creative Youth Opportunities is a registrered CIC and they will help us with the financial side of things, making sure the money is spent properly, ethically and well. And because we will be working under them the whole not for profit thing will mean as we grow and can cover our costs, if we do make any profit it will go right back into doing projects with young poeple.</p>
<p>We think being part of this project will really help us in the future and we are sure the positive things we can promote will have a positive effect on other young people. We even think lots more young people will want to be involved once they see what a big success it is!</p>
<p>We need your help to get our big plans off the ground...once we are in production we are sure you will be impressed and glad you supported us! We are asking for £3,000 to get us enough, with a little from advertising, to be able to design and print our first quarterly magazine, if we don't reach our target, don't worry we won't change our plans and your money won't go to waste because we'll just print less for our first print run and make sure we get it all off the ground anyway, but wouldn't it be great if we could go big from the start and it's because you helped us!</p>

The Creative Youth Organisation we work with is a not for profit, they have years of experience working with young people just like us. The staff there have worked with young people.... like forever and the people from Now East Durham know their stuff too so we know we are well supported.
Once we have our magazine up and running we know we can cover costs with relevant, youth focused advertising so we only need the money to get us started! Creative Youth Opportunities is a registrered CIC and they will help us with the financial side of things, making sure the money is spent properly, ethically and well. And because we will be working under them the whole not for profit thing will mean as we grow and can cover our costs, if we do make any profit it will go right back into doing projects with young poeple.
We think being part of this project will really help us in the future and we are sure the positive things we can promote will have a positive effect on other young people. We even think lots more young people will want to be involved once they see what a big success it is!
We need your help to get our big plans off the ground...once we are in production we are sure you will be impressed and glad you supported us! We are asking for £3,000 to get us enough, with a little from advertising, to be able to design and print our first quarterly magazine, if we don't reach our target, don't worry we won't change our plans and your money won't go to waste because we'll just print less for our first print run and make sure we get it all off the ground anyway, but wouldn't it be great if we could go big from the start and it's because you helped us!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

What Makes My Books Worth Sponsoring - What's the Story...?




First of all, everyone is most welcome to learn more about the 'storyverse' in the Journals of the Twinned Souls  by visiting my author's website at: www.Cymbric.com
In essence, the story behind the Journals of the Twinned Souls is one of 'Recognition'.  I think many people can connect with that concept because at one time or another, most of us have either read about or even experienced it for ourselves 
In fact, many cultures have cherished
and preserved stories that center on the concept of Recognition, where certain people encounter one another and immediately connect on an often subtle, but

obstacles of great distance, culture or hardship before they eventually encounter each other, but when they do, they seem to immediately share a mutual kinship - a kinship so strong that if they stopped to think about it, they'd realize that in many ways it defies
rational explanation.  
Some of these stories we know from our own lives and experiences. And some are the most famous stories in history, as old as
the ancient Tale of Gilgamesh, or Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet.  Over the course of millennia the names
and settings for these tales have changed - often many times in the retelling. And yet, all over the world and

us to believe that we too, can find and share a bond with someone that is

The stories from the Journals of the Twinned Souls are about people, who, through a sometimes heartrending kinship of spirit, have accompanied one another through hundreds of lifetimes. No matter how distant the journey or how difficult the circumstances, they've always found each other.  In Book One, ""The Janus Paradox"" everything changes in a way that will challenge that bond to its core and compel them to search for one another across centuries...



 Why This Campaign... With all the attendant costs of getting my name and my book titles out in the public eye, while attending Writers Conferences and Conventions, and promoting my books in every other way I can think of, I knew I would need an extra boost. Otherwise, as a debut author, it is all rather daunting and expensive, especially considering my tiny teacher's salary.  

   What I Need & What You Get

 My hope is to consistently attend as many Writers Conferences and Fan Conventions as I can get to and to have a range of promotional materials available to help me stand out from the crowd and generate 'buzz' about Journals of the Twinned Souls - in addition to, quite honestly, sponsoring myself for the time I need to complete Book Three: ""TimeBound"".  And of course, IndieGoGo takes its ~ 10%, when all is done, for sponsoring the campaign site and processing the donations, etc.

<h3>Why should I read this book?</h3>
<p>Everyone knows an atheist.  You may not know it, but you do.  Many atheists are closeted because of the social and familial stigma that comes with being an open atheist in a society full of religious believers.  Often referred to as the fastest growing demographic in America, those with no religious affiliation make up about 10-15% of the US population.  That means it's likely that 1 out of every 10 people you know either doesn't subscribe to an organized religion or doesn't believe in a supreme being at all.  </p>
<p><i>Understanding an Atheist</i> is a book written by Kevin Davis, head writer at the popular blog <a href=""http://www.dividedundergod.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">DividedUnderGod.com</a>.  This book was written for anyone who knows a nonbeliever, whether they're open about their beliefs or not.  In it, Kevin takes you through his own experiences, raised Catholic, once Evangelical Christian, then closeted atheist, now openly a nonbeliever and active in the atheist community.  Through this journey, readers will gain an understanding of what it's like for someone to abandon faith in the supernatural and gravitate toward evidence-based reasoning, ultimately facing the taboo of being a nonbeliever.  </p>
<p>The purpose of this book is not to tear down religion or the religious, but to bring to light the issues facing your atheist friends and family.  If you have a friend or family member who is an atheist you might have thought,</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it ok to pray at meals when they're over for dinner?</li>
<li>Why do they hate God?</li>
<li>What do they think happens when we die?</li>
<li>Should I bring up their atheism in conversation or just ignore it?</li>
<li>Why don't they just go to church 'just in case'?</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Understanding an Atheist</i> will attempt to answer these questions for you, by giving you some insight into how the mind of an atheist operates, what they stand for, what prejudices they face, and how they feel, surrounded by religion every day.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Why contribute?</h3>
<p>All contributors will receive an advance PDF copy of the book, compatible with any eReader, tablet or PC.  The PDF copy will be delivered by November 1, giving you enough time to read it before your family reunions over the holidays!</p>
<p>In addition, contributors may also receive:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paperback copies of the book.</li>
<li>Paperback copies, signed by the author with the inscription of your choice.</li>
<li>A mention by name in the Special Thanks section of the book.</li>
<li>A one on one discussion with the author via Skype, to help you through any issues you may be having with your atheist loved ones (related to atheism of course, I'm not a sex therapist).</li>
<li>A personal meeting with the author over lunch, anywhere in the continental US, complete with a personal book signing.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute, I ask that you share this campaign with anyone that you feel could benefit from this book.   Send the link via email, Facebook or Twitter.  Many atheists feel misunderstood by their loved ones and the aim of this book is to enhance that understanding and mend these relationships.</p></span></span></span></span></span></div>","Why should I read this book?

The purpose of this book is not to tear down religion or the religious, but to bring to light the issues facing your atheist friends and family.  If you have a friend or family member who is an atheist you might have thought,

Is it ok to pray at meals when they're over for dinner?
Why do they hate God?
What do they think happens when we die?
Should I bring up their atheism in conversation or just ignore it?
Why don't they just go to church 'just in case'?

Understanding an Atheist will attempt to answer these questions for you, by giving you some insight into how the mind of an atheist operates, what they stand for, what prejudices they face, and how they feel, surrounded by religion every day.


Why contribute?
All contributors will receive an advance PDF copy of the book, compatible with any eReader, tablet or PC.  The PDF copy will be delivered by November 1, giving you enough time to read it before your family reunions over the holidays!

Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't contribute, I ask that you share this campaign with anyone that you feel could benefit from this book.   Send the link via email, Facebook or Twitter.  Many atheists feel misunderstood by their loved ones and the aim of this book is to enhance that understanding and mend these relationships.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div>Did you know that 9 out of 10 startups fail? All these failed attempts take away too much time and energy from entrepreneurs. We should change this! <b>We need a smarter way of building new innovative companies.</b> The Startup Studio Playbook will teach you a new venture building model. One that takes out much of the risk from creating startups.</div>
<div><ul>
<li>It will be a 300-pages book available in digital, audio and hardcover format. </li>
<li>It's aimed at entrepreneurs and people who deal with innovation. </li>
<li>Every backer will get a Christmas Gift, shipped to you on 17th December 2015.</li>

<div> <h3>Why I'm doing this</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>Hi, I’m Attila, entrepreneur. When I built my first startup, we participated in one of Europe's best accelerators - Startup Sauna, we talked to our customers, pivoted, put everything we have into our idea. And we still failed. </p>
<p>If you’ve ever built a startup, you know the feeling. Even if you put all your passion and energy into your idea, there’s still a high risk of not succeeding. <br/></p>
<p>Before starting my next company, <b>I wanted to find a smarter way.</b> One that takes out the risk of startup building. That turns venture building in something that feels like playing with your Legos. This is how I discovered the startup studio, a.k.a. venture builder model.</p>
<p>Early this year I wrote two publications on this topic. But I wanted to do more, so everybody can learn about this opportunity. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What is a startup studio</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>Simply put, a startup studio is an
entrepreneurial organization. It’s like a movie studio. In a movie studio, you are building multiple movies simultaneously, using well-tested processes. <b>In a startup studio, you are experimenting with multiple ideas and products.</b></p>
<p>If one of them fails, you keep the people and start something new. You don't lose your talented team. And if one of your initiatives is successful, you spin it off into a dedicated company. And you continue to grow
it like any other startup. Huge potential with minimal risk.</p>
<p></p>

<div><i>(Startup studios are startups that build startups. )</i></div>Since early 2015 I'm working in such a studio. And it's amazing! We have a great team of entrepreneurs and developers. And we are building exciting new products. We've already built 6 startups, and we will build many more.</div>
<div>When I first researched this topic, I wanted to find out how many other studios there are. And I was excited to find out that there are more and more.</div>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447660185/mgh36jcls33wkfwijqm0.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

</div>
<div>
<p>And these studios do better and better every year. Venture capital Investments into studios doubles every two years. Studios grow more mature and start more and more companies every year. Besides entrepreneurs, large companies also started to use this model to boost their innovation.</p>
<p>If you look at the most popular entrepreneurship magazines, you will find more and more studio related news and articles:</p>

<p><br/></p>
<p><b>And I want you to know all about this opportunity.</b> This is why I already published two short documents about this subject. And this is why I'm writing the Startup Studio Playbook. So you can use this knowledge to your own advantage.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Why should you care</h3>More and more people are discovering the power and opportunity of entrepreneurship. People want to be free and work on something meaningful. Something that provides them with the financials for a worry-free life and gives them enough flexibility to spend time on family, friends and themselves. </div>
<div>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">This is hard to achieve in a large corporation. I've been there. And I quit, so I can build something that I find meaningful. I know that more and more people are doing the same or want to do it. <b>For more and more people, entrepreneurship and building a thriving startup is the answer.</b></span><br/></p>

<br/><p></p>
<p>But building a business is challenging. And if you want to build a startup - an experimental organization to create something groundbreaking - then you face serious challenges. The old formula is to find the perfect idea, find the perfect cofounders, build the perfect product and raise the necessary funds. But this is not so easy in most parts of the world.</p>
<p>This is why 9 out of 10 startups fail. If you've already experimented with a startup, you know the feeling. If you prepare to launch your first company, you are probably worried about this.</p>
<p>But why would we just accept these grim chances? Why not look for a better way? Why not leave behind the old formula that feels like risky gambling and try something that feels like exciting exploration? </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Startup Studio Playbook </h3>
<p></p>
<p>The Startup Studio Playbook will show you a better method for building a business. It will be a 300-page
comprehensive guide. It is aimed at <b>entrepreneurs, investors, innovation
managers</b> and their teams. It will be full of interviews, stories and best
practices that will teach you how to use this model to become a successful
venture builder.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<br/>
<p>The Startup Studio Playbook will show you the world of
startup studios in three different ways:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">In the first part of the book you will read <b>interviews</b>

</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The second part will tell you <b>stories</b> of the greatest studio hits, and some of the ugly failures in a novel style. We will unfold the journey of the selected companies. From the birth of the idea, through the building and fundraising stage right until
their exit. Expect some drama.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The third part will be a <b>how-to-guide</b>. It will give you hands-on methods for building
the concept for a studio. Hiring a great team, coming up
with viable ideas, building your first companies, establishing great investor relations…</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>We already have commitment and interest from a dozen studios who want to share their stories. You can expect stories like</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>From zero to hero - Building a studio as sole entrepreneur</li>
<li>Money rain - How to raise millions in days</li>
<li>Homebred cash cows - Successful bootstrapped studios</li>

<i>(Photo by  <a href=""http://csabarittling.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Csaba Rittling</a>)</i><p>Hi, I’m
Attila, entrepreneur from Budapest.<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> I started my
career as a volunteer at IAESTE. Then I worked at IBM and Citigroup as Project
Manager. But in 2014 I felt that I need to change directions. I quit, and
started my first startup, Rate My Speech.</span></p>
<p>It was
supposed to help people improve their public speaking skills. Me and my team
were absolutely passionate about our idea. So we entered all startup
competitions and told about our vision. This got us into the Finnish Startup
Sauna accelerator, and we were able to visit Silicon Valley thanks to a program called Startup Spring.</p>
<p>Unfortunately
after ten months of hard work, we had to admit to ourselves that our value
proposition and business model was not strong enough. Our startup failed, and the
team scattered. </p>
<p>It took me some months to recover. And I decided, that
before starting my new venture, I’ll find a better way to do it. I looked at many
entrepreneurship programs, accelerators, incubators, but all had the same
limitations. You had to build your startup from zero, put in all your soul and
risk everything – and your chances were still only 1 to 10 to make it.</p>
<p>But then, fortunately, I found the solution. I joined a
company called Drukka that used a so-called startup studio model. And the rest is history.</p>

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<i>In what language are you publishing the Startup Studio Playbook?</i>

 Why I'm doing this


Hi, I’m Attila, entrepreneur. When I built my first startup, we participated in one of Europe's best accelerators - Startup Sauna, we talked to our customers, pivoted, put everything we have into our idea. And we still failed. 
If you’ve ever built a startup, you know the feeling. Even if you put all your passion and energy into your idea, there’s still a high risk of not succeeding. 
Before starting my next company, I wanted to find a smarter way. One that takes out the risk of startup building. That turns venture building in something that feels like playing with your Legos. This is how I discovered the startup studio, a.k.a. venture builder model.
Early this year I wrote two publications on this topic. But I wanted to do more, so everybody can learn about this opportunity. 


What is a startup studio


Simply put, a startup studio is an
entrepreneurial organization. It’s like a movie studio. In a movie studio, you are building multiple movies simultaneously, using well-tested processes. In a startup studio, you are experimenting with multiple ideas and products.
If one of them fails, you keep the people and start something new. You don't lose your talented team. And if one of your initiatives is successful, you spin it off into a dedicated company. And you continue to grow
it like any other startup. Huge potential with minimal risk.



(Startup studios are startups that build startups. )Since early 2015 I'm working in such a studio. And it's amazing! We have a great team of entrepreneurs and developers. And we are building exciting new products. We've already built 6 startups, and we will build many more.
When I first researched this topic, I wanted to find out how many other studios there are. And I was excited to find out that there are more and more.


(Startup studios and their portfolio companies. Picture from Startup Studio Trends, 2015)


And these studios do better and better every year. Venture capital Investments into studios doubles every two years. Studios grow more mature and start more and more companies every year. Besides entrepreneurs, large companies also started to use this model to boost their innovation.
If you look at the most popular entrepreneurship magazines, you will find more and more studio related news and articles:
""This ‘startup studio model’ is becoming increasingly popular in the US and Europe""  on Tech.eu
""Being a Startup Studio means that we develop ideas into products and products into companies. We’re lean and the ability to quickly innovate, build and test new products gives us much more flexibility than a traditional rigid startup model."" on RyanNegri.com
""Harvard Is Taking on NYC with Its Upcoming HBS Startup Studio""  on BostInno
""if you ask most startup studio owners, they will tell you that they are simply professionalising the discovery and traction phase.""  on TheNordicWeb.com
""Entrepreneur-turned-investor is a classic story arc in Silicon Valley but recently the plot has earned a twist. Certain operators are foregoing the traditional path of joining a traditional VC to instead create a studio-like holding operation."" on TechCrunch
""You’ll want to get used to the idea because we’re going to see a lot more venture-building organizations emerging."" on VentureBeat

You can find many more stories about startup studios on Buildtogether.co, which is maintained by the great people behind the startup studio eFounders.

And I want you to know all about this opportunity. This is why I already published two short documents about this subject. And this is why I'm writing the Startup Studio Playbook. So you can use this knowledge to your own advantage.


Why should you careMore and more people are discovering the power and opportunity of entrepreneurship. People want to be free and work on something meaningful. Something that provides them with the financials for a worry-free life and gives them enough flexibility to spend time on family, friends and themselves. 

This is hard to achieve in a large corporation. I've been there. And I quit, so I can build something that I find meaningful. I know that more and more people are doing the same or want to do it. For more and more people, entrepreneurship and building a thriving startup is the answer.



But building a business is challenging. And if you want to build a startup - an experimental organization to create something groundbreaking - then you face serious challenges. The old formula is to find the perfect idea, find the perfect cofounders, build the perfect product and raise the necessary funds. But this is not so easy in most parts of the world.
This is why 9 out of 10 startups fail. If you've already experimented with a startup, you know the feeling. If you prepare to launch your first company, you are probably worried about this.
But why would we just accept these grim chances? Why not look for a better way? Why not leave behind the old formula that feels like risky gambling and try something that feels like exciting exploration? 


Startup Studio Playbook 

The Startup Studio Playbook will show you a better method for building a business. It will be a 300-page
comprehensive guide. It is aimed at entrepreneurs, investors, innovation
managers and their teams. It will be full of interviews, stories and best
practices that will teach you how to use this model to become a successful
venture builder.




The Startup Studio Playbook will show you the world of
startup studios in three different ways:



In the first part of the book you will read interviews
with successful studio founders. In these interviews we will discuss their motivation, vision, challenges, highlights and lowlights of their journey.


The second part will tell you stories of the greatest studio hits, and some of the ugly failures in a novel style. We will unfold the journey of the selected companies. From the birth of the idea, through the building and fundraising stage right until
their exit. Expect some drama.


The third part will be a how-to-guide. It will give you hands-on methods for building
the concept for a studio. Hiring a great team, coming up
with viable ideas, building your first companies, establishing great investor relations…




We already have commitment and interest from a dozen studios who want to share their stories. You can expect stories like


From zero to hero - Building a studio as sole entrepreneur
Money rain - How to raise millions in days
Homebred cash cows - Successful bootstrapped studios
Around the table - Holacracy and co-ownership for studio governance

Failure is always an option - The ugly side of the studio model


With your contribution, me and my team will create a
well-researched, beautifully designed, unique book. 



Your rewards 



Thanks to the flexibility of the
Indiegogo platform we created many offers, so that you find the best one for you. We are excited to share these rewards with you:



All backers of this campaign will get a Christmas Gift package that will contain a digital postcard and two short ebooks on startup studios. 


You can get the Startup Studio Playbook in ebook, audiobook and limited edition hardcover format. 


Some Indiegogo-exclusive packages give you access to backer-only updates and unedited background material. 


You can get one-on-one video chat with me, to ask any questions you might have about studios. I’m happy to help you create and grow your own studio. 


We will also unveil exciting new perks as part of soon-to-be-announced stretch goals. 



You will receive the Christmas Gift package by 17th December 2015. You will get the digital version of the Startup Studio Playbook in May 2016, and you will get the hardcover after June 2016.



Christmas Gift
Before we started this campaign, we made our homework, and did a thorough research on startup studios. Between May and November we published two short ebooks, both priced at $3. Now you will get both of these for free, and a nice digital Christmas postcard, with any perk you select.





Startup Studio Trends

Originally published in July, this updated ebook will contain an analysis of 51 studios and 212 of their portfolio companies.
You will see lists of these companies, and how they grow in number.
You will learn about the ever increasing venture funding of studios and how they exit with their portfolio companies.

Anatomy of Startup Studios

Published on October 2015. This ebook is based on interviews with some of the most successful and exciting studios: Betaworks, Disrupted, Drukka, eFounders, Finleap, Lab.Coop, sFBI, Quasar Ventures.
You will read about the foundations of a great studio. How to build a rockstar team, how to organize day-to-day operations, and build lucrative investor relations.
You will also read a long list of pros and cons of the startup studio model.




Roadmap

We are keeping a tight schedule so you can read the Startup Studio Playbook as soon as possible. We already completed much of the data gathering and quantitative research of studios. What remains are the in-depth interviews with some of the greatest startup studios, and then the editing and publishing.  





Team
Both creating this campaign, and creating the Startup Studio Playbook are formidable challenges. I'm lucky that I work together with enthusiastic and talented people who can make this happen.


Patricia Krcsma is a fellow entrepreneur and marketer at Drukka Startup Studio. She is the Head of Marketing of one of our rising stars, Helpy.hu which is an on-demand cleaning platform. Patricia helped me to shape our communication plan, so we reach all those people who can get value out of the Startup Studio Playbook.


Tom Juskó is a fellow entrepreneur. We know each other since we met on a Hackathon-in-a-box event. Tom and his team were fantastic partners in creating our campaign video.



Csaba Rittling is a close friend, ever since we volunteered for the same student organization during college. Nowadays Csaba is a commercial photographer. He helps me to capture some of the pivotal moments of the editorial process.


Tamás Turcsán is the founder of Connect East Incubator, lector of the Hungarian version of Lean Startup, journalist, fellow entrepreneur, organizer of the Hackathon-in-a-box events. And a friend who helped me throughout my entrepreneurial journey. Tamás will make sure that I bring the most out of the Startup Studio Playbook.


To publish the book, I selected a publishing partner that supports self-publishers and already has a great track record of publishing unique books. As we are still finalizing our agreement I can't just yet reveal their name. But I can ensure you that they have all the technical background and expertise that we need to produce a high quality product for you.


I also would like to thank Natalie Edwards from startup studio sFBI. She was kind enough to read early drafts of this campaign, and provided me with the guidance to improve it. 


 Risks & Challenges My team and i have a track record on punctuality, and we will do everything to deliver your rewards on time. We already have commitments from studios to dedicate their time and wisdom for the interviews. And we are already working with designers to prepare everything ahead.
However, there might be unforeseen challenges ahead. We will keep you well informed throughout the entire project, about our achievements and issues. 
According to our plan you will receive the Christmas Gift on 17th December 2015. You will get the ebook and audio version of the book in May 2016 and the hardcover in July.




How you can helpThe success of this campaign depends on getting the word out. And you can help us with this! Tell your friends and colleagues, who are interested in entrepreneurship and innovation.
In the Startup Studio Playbook we will dedicate a section to those people who help us spread the world. Get your name into the book by sharing our campaign!

Thank you!
Attila

Author bio



(Photo by  Csaba Rittling)Hi, I’m
Attila, entrepreneur from Budapest. I started my
career as a volunteer at IAESTE. Then I worked at IBM and Citigroup as Project
Manager. But in 2014 I felt that I need to change directions. I quit, and
started my first startup, Rate My Speech.
It was
supposed to help people improve their public speaking skills. Me and my team
were absolutely passionate about our idea. So we entered all startup
competitions and told about our vision. This got us into the Finnish Startup
Sauna accelerator, and we were able to visit Silicon Valley thanks to a program called Startup Spring.
Unfortunately
after ten months of hard work, we had to admit to ourselves that our value
proposition and business model was not strong enough. Our startup failed, and the
team scattered. 
It took me some months to recover. And I decided, that
before starting my new venture, I’ll find a better way to do it. I looked at many
entrepreneurship programs, accelerators, incubators, but all had the same
limitations. You had to build your startup from zero, put in all your soul and
risk everything – and your chances were still only 1 to 10 to make it.
But then, fortunately, I found the solution. I joined a
company called Drukka that used a so-called startup studio model. And the rest is history.



FAQ
In what language are you publishing the Startup Studio Playbook?

The book will be in english. We would love to publish it also in other languages, but we need sponsors to do that. The amount we are asking for in the ""Sponsor a language"" perk would gully go to translation and design of a custom cover.

On what device will I be able to read the digital version?
We will make sure that the digital version is available on all major ebook platforms.

Why are worldwide shipping costs so high?
Almost all of the hardcover perks come with a $19 shipping cost. We spent a lot of time finding the best option available, and the partner we found operates at these costs. This is to ensure that we can ship to anywhere and be sure that your package arrives on time, in a perfect condition.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>After writing nearly <strong>two hundred computer science lessons</strong> and more than <strong>seven complete books</strong>, I was still at the place where tackling JavaScript for young students seemed like a daunting task. With the hard decision to make between navigating the HTML, CSS, JS combo, or being restricted to dull text-based projects, my preference was to wait until a more user-friendly platform was introduced.</p>
<p>Here we are in 2020, and I've FINALLY found a platform that lets me <strong>present JavaScript to students in a fun and simple way</strong>, with the rich examples and playful experiences that young students deserve.</p>
<p>Join me in working to get this short (but powerful) book to parents, teachers, and libraries so that young students can start their exciting journey to understanding JavaScript programming.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This will be my first self-published title, so without the financial backing of a large publishing house, I'm going to need to get the word around in a BIG WAY!</p>
<p>Here's what I need from you:</p>
<ul>
<li>I need less than $500 to cover the initial expenses of getting a new book to market.  I'll be starting the book in digital and in paperback on the Amazon platform, so there won't be a huge expenditure for building stock.</li>
<li>I'm trying to keep my asks tiny so that EVERYONE can get in on the fun!</li>
<li>
<strong>Whether I reach my goal or not</strong>, I'll be able to get this book out in one form or another.  (It's almost already complete and there are copies out in the wild with 5th-grade teachers as we speak!)</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your money will help me get this book published so that we can show the big houses that text-based languages can be taught with playful purpose.  There's no need to keep churning out boring titles that miss the mark with young students, poisoning them to the idea of programming before they've even started.  <strong>This book will get kids coding quickly</strong>, teaching them how to handle bugs and unexpected challenges.  Just what every teacher wants to see!<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I am just one person, and I'm writing and laying out the book by myself.  While there's hardly anything left to do, I am determined to test-drive this book with teachers and incorporate meaningful feedback.  That could, potentially, push back my release date while I see to important edits.<br/> </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are on the verge of a renaissance of our own, one where we embrace creative collaboration to elevate our creations. The Art of Collaboration is where you can hear from the people who are masters of collaboration.<br/><br/>My name is Sydney Welch and I was inspired to write this book after dedicating my senior year of college to researching Leonardo da Vinci and the Italian Renaissance workshop. I became fascinated with the idea of renaissance and how to enter into one’s own. It occurred to me then that what the world needed to embrace collaboration.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how to utilize collaboration in your own creative practices. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for collaboration. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you embrace collaboration and use it to collectively elevate your creations.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about Collaboration and Collective Creation.</p>
<ul>
<li>You will engage with the background of the Renaissance workshop, my experiences with collaboration, and an in-depth look into how collaboration works. </li>
<li>Creative professionals breakdown the tools necessary for collaboration in Part 2.</li>
<li>Finally, you will explore testimonies from successful collaborators and see how their use of collaboration elevated their projects and careers in real and tangible ways. </li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you identify as a creator, artist, innovator, entrepreneur, or creative-type. The Art of Collaboration is a non-fiction book that speaks to the aforementioned identities looking at how to embrace collaboration and learn how to implement it into their creative practices. <br/> </p>
<h3><strong>The Book - The Art of Collaboration</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The book is written in 3 Parts....</strong><br/><br/><strong>Part 1 </strong>contains the introduction and additional chapters. This part covers the background of the Italian Renaissance workshop tradition, a look at how it has evolved in modern times, a breakdown of collaboration, and my story. <br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains chapters that focus on the tools needed to successfully collaborate and examples and stories of what those tools look like in practice. You will dive into tools like emotional intelligence and defining roles in order to effectively collaborate. <br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> contains chapters that highlight real-life testimonies of the power and success that come with collaboration. You will hear from creators, artists, and innovators who used collaboration to start or elevate their careers and creations. </p>

<h2>About the Author</h2>
<p><br/>Sydney Welch is a young collaborator who has worked on multiple projects that have inspired her book. She worked on two public art projects that culminated in two murals being painted at the Glenside Train Station in Glenside, PA during her time at Arcadia University. She spent a year of her undergraduate studies traveling abroad where she initially came up with the radical idea of embracing collaboration. Sydney has since earned her Bachelor’s degree in Art History with a minor in Religion. During her senior year, she wrote her thesis on Leonardo da Vinci and the concept of Authorship, which inspired a large part of the book as well.</p>
<p><br/>She believes in the power of collaboration to make things great. All of her greatest achievements have involved collaboration, and she truly believes that two heads are better than one!<br/><br/>When she is not writing, Sydney spends time with her friends and cousins in New Jersey for the summer. In the fall she will teach secondary English in Philadelphia at a Charter School. Sydney is excited to see how this book will influence her teaching and her future endeavors. She has thoroughly enjoyed writing this book and all the amazing conversations that have blossomed since she began it in February. She hopes the conversations will continue and is so grateful for all the support. <br/> </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>

I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.<br/><br/>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.<br/> </p>

We are on the verge of a renaissance of our own, one where we embrace creative collaboration to elevate our creations. The Art of Collaboration is where you can hear from the people who are masters of collaboration.My name is Sydney Welch and I was inspired to write this book after dedicating my senior year of college to researching Leonardo da Vinci and the Italian Renaissance workshop. I became fascinated with the idea of renaissance and how to enter into one’s own. It occurred to me then that what the world needed to embrace collaboration.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how to utilize collaboration in your own creative practices. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for collaboration. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you embrace collaboration and use it to collectively elevate your creations.In this book, you'll learn about Collaboration and Collective Creation.

You will engage with the background of the Renaissance workshop, my experiences with collaboration, and an in-depth look into how collaboration works. 
Creative professionals breakdown the tools necessary for collaboration in Part 2.
Finally, you will explore testimonies from successful collaborators and see how their use of collaboration elevated their projects and careers in real and tangible ways. 

You will love this book if you identify as a creator, artist, innovator, entrepreneur, or creative-type. The Art of Collaboration is a non-fiction book that speaks to the aforementioned identities looking at how to embrace collaboration and learn how to implement it into their creative practices.  
The Book - The Art of Collaboration
The book is written in 3 Parts....Part 1 contains the introduction and additional chapters. This part covers the background of the Italian Renaissance workshop tradition, a look at how it has evolved in modern times, a breakdown of collaboration, and my story. Part 2 contains chapters that focus on the tools needed to successfully collaborate and examples and stories of what those tools look like in practice. You will dive into tools like emotional intelligence and defining roles in order to effectively collaborate. Part 3 contains chapters that highlight real-life testimonies of the power and success that come with collaboration. You will hear from creators, artists, and innovators who used collaboration to start or elevate their careers and creations.

About the Author
Sydney Welch is a young collaborator who has worked on multiple projects that have inspired her book. She worked on two public art projects that culminated in two murals being painted at the Glenside Train Station in Glenside, PA during her time at Arcadia University. She spent a year of her undergraduate studies traveling abroad where she initially came up with the radical idea of embracing collaboration. Sydney has since earned her Bachelor’s degree in Art History with a minor in Religion. During her senior year, she wrote her thesis on Leonardo da Vinci and the concept of Authorship, which inspired a large part of the book as well.
She believes in the power of collaboration to make things great. All of her greatest achievements have involved collaboration, and she truly believes that two heads are better than one!When she is not writing, Sydney spends time with her friends and cousins in New Jersey for the summer. In the fall she will teach secondary English in Philadelphia at a Charter School. Sydney is excited to see how this book will influence her teaching and her future endeavors. She has thoroughly enjoyed writing this book and all the amazing conversations that have blossomed since she began it in February. She hopes the conversations will continue and is so grateful for all the support.  
 

Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use.

It feels way more like a story compared to all other ‘retro’ books. This is all so much about the people, and what gives it an extra dimension is the fact I’ve met lots of them at the STNICCC 2015 (demo party).” – Maarten Martens“I knew the quality of the book would be good, but I am shocked by the professional quality of this piece of art! Everything from the interviews and articles to things like paper and print quality.” – Tobias Jansson“Have watched this go from an idea to being realised. Well done, you have created a book worthy of the demoscene that inspired it.” – Adam Ransom“As one of the few U.S. people I knew with an ST, I always felt like I was missing out on the scene in Europe. This book has done an amazing job to put into view the things I could only dream to understand about: what was happening back in those days. This Kickstarter was worth every penny and more.” – Nick Haas“[...] Many sleepless hours trying to pixel something, joyful hours flew past in gaming as Thalion was our Psygnosis. [...] Back then I had no idea why demos, early games and utilities turned out how they did. Or who were the wizkids behind them. Or how on earth they manage the ST to do things no one ever imagined possible when it was launched! Now I’m starting to get the picture and I’m hungry for more. For me this is not just another Kickstarter book I backed. This is an important moment in our beloved Atari ST history. A trip into our underground culture the way it should be told.” – Marko Latvanen / Atarimania.com The true story of a digital underground scene, forced to be amazingly creative in coding and art.We go back in time, when the Atari ST and Amiga were still revolutionary mouse-operating machines and the future of DTP and interactive design has begun to shape nowadays IT professions. The Atari ST and the Creative PeopleThe book series exposes the Atari Corporation, surpasses the marketing of Atari Computers and explores the contemporary life of a demo scene, whose creative people were on a rollercoaster ride to the blooming digital entertainment industry.Volume 1, 1987 – 1990, BREAKIN’ THE BORDERS (on sale) Volume 2, 1991 – 1994, BEYOND THE BORDERS (this campaign)Volume 3, 1994 – …....Asking the peopleWhat was it like to grow up in the 80s and 90s?

What did they learn? And what are they doing today? More on microzeit.comWrapped in a glimmering cover, volume 2 represents the vibrant pixel era after the events of the 1st tome. ​The official cover design will be unwrapped before delivery in 2018! Even though we are hooked on this flashing pixelated envelope, it remains a simple visualization and symbolizes our vision of the forthcoming storyline. We start the work on the cover after the finishing of the book production. Thus we are able to find an essential representation of the bespoken time period. The spine will also fit to the predecessor BREAKIN’ THE BORDERS which gained a lot of positive press recommendations.

 More on microzeit.comThe early 90s. It’s the beginning of the end of a digital era.
It also marks the golden years of underground culture. The demo scene grows steadily and discovers a variety of new techniques to overcome the limits of Atari’s 16/32-bit systems – often with an upcoming profession in mind.The game industry is changing and Japanese consoles overtake the market by storm. The Manga style infects European artists. IBM PC’s are gaining more attention. Philips CD-ROM promises to be the storage media of the future, while Commodore stays a tough opponent. Atari tries to rescue its market share by introducing the Falcon and the Mega STE, yet striving back to the console market with the first 64-bit console.  Thalion in Gütersloh experience an internal division and must face their origin. Most European game publishers turn their backs to the ST. Former sceners won’t give up so fast, instead they are even heading to new horizons. Only one last thing has to be given to the test: are the crackers responsible for the overall sales decline? BEYOND THE BORDERS goes beyond – in every aspect. This volume not only presents some of the best artistic works on Atari’s 16-bit computers, but also gives the readers a chance to experience the downfall of the home computer industry from an Atari perspective. Volume 2 is a highly compressed tome, packed with unforgettable Atari ST/e demos, unbelievable last-minute-achievements, underground background stories and features. The demoscene burts further into bloom with even more people investing into their digital future. The following creative people announced their participation, whether as informer or full interview partner.The actual participants will be revealed in the finished book:

I reach out my hands to even more artists of that time. Some have offered me their collaboration already. Additionally, the people of volume 1 will assist with their knowledge and experiences again. They refer as contemporary witnesses, but staying in the background: e.g. Marc Rosocha, Erik Simon, Richard Karsmakers, Stefan Kimmlingen, Michael Schüßler, Michael Raasch, Niklas Malmqvist, David and Tim Moss or Jochen Hippel. Ex-crackers speak about their activities and voice their opinion on software piracy in the 90s.BEYOND integrates the pros and cons of this deeply divisive topic of the ST scene. We ask people from:
Vectronix 
Delight 
The Replicants 
Medway Boys

The video clip takes over. Techno, house, acid and the new MTV culture mark it’s influences in the design of computer demos.Fast 3D techniques become the new thing to keep up with. Sequential multi-part presentations entertain with visual storytelling and through clever programming the little Yamaha sounds similar to the SID. While most coders still squeeze out the last bits of the Atari ST/STE series, some already explore the 32-bit abilities of Atari’s Falcon machine.Shiny multi-page layouts envision the most creative demo works of that time. A beautiful selection of contemporary motion design on paper.

 Not only games evolve from the scene, but also tools. Expose Software tries their luck. To keep up with the fast-paced developments in the 90s a lot of new disc magazines appear – competitors to ST NEWS. We ask the editors of DBA and Maggie how they produced their content and what they challenged these days.  Tilmann Bubeck talks about his work on NEOchrome Master. Gunnar Gaubatz and Joris de Man shed a light on their extraordinary sound development.What were the choices, what the experiences? Learn more about contemporary disc magazines, chipsound editors and pixel painters. Find an overview of the most important creation tools. We ask the makers!  In the same pace the industry production for the Atari ST goes down, the scene productions goes up.Artists like NiKo and Spaz use intense diffusion techniques which literally let the pixels flow into each other. Due to the 120 raster we use for print, we have double as high density as offset print normally offers. Rediscover the fascination of pixel art on paper in perfect detail.   BEYOND presents a lavish art gallery with mini portraits of the artists. See and believe what those guys were capable of, with just 16 colors and 320 x 200 pixels at hand. The demoscene plays an important role in my creative life.In 1991 I joined STAX to intensify my efforts in pixel graphic and animation. I was hungry for working with other creative people. We made fantastic plans. With Matt and Mike everything turned out to be bigger than expected. But there was only one way to go – out of our little worlds. In BEYOND I want to share this life changing experience with you. Volume 2 introduces the story of STAX. For that I’ll interview my old companions, after meeting them for the first time in 18 years.  We decide to concentrate on the quality of the book production, thus the goodie pack is smaller this time.
