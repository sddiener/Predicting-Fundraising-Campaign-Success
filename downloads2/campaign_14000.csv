<p><strong>Who is ""Em²a Cartoon""?</strong></p>
<p>Hi! My name is Emma Lysyk. I draw a slice of life/art journal webcomic called Em²a Cartoon, that can be found at <a href=""http://www.emacartoon.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""EmaCartoon.com"">EmaCartoon.com</a>. Em²a started as a way for me to illustrate my thoughts and feelings in place of a diary. I am a magnet for strange happenings, and I get wild and crazy ideas. My friends wanted a place to keep up with me after all my moves, so I created EmaCartoon.com to share with the world what life with a crazy artist is like.</p>
<p>The key players in my comic are Em²a, my inner redhead; Orion, my imaginary boyfriend; Mandy, my kick-ass bff roommate; Mikey, my goofy awesome roommate; our cats - Yin, Yang, Sheba, Sam, and Ash; and our dogs - Sonny, Breic, and Jesse (who recently passed away).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Em²a Cartoon World of Art</strong></p>
<p>Oh my gosh! Em²a Cartoon has been online for 10 years (and even longer offline). To celebrate, I think we should make a book!</p>
<p>You've been asking, and now I'm making it happen. There’s so much of my art that I have doodled all over the place, never making it up on the interwebs, and collecting dust in my art folder of doom. I’ve been meaning to do this for ages, and can’t think of a better time or method how.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>What You Get</strong></p>
<p>The Em²a Cartoon World of Art will be a 9” wide x 7” tall landscape 100-page paperback book with glossy pages featuring both the published and never-before-seen art of the Em²a Cartoon world. Inside you’ll find sketches, paintings, character studies, and animal pictures galore, as well as every comic from the beginning through April 30, 2013.</p>
<p>The digital version will be a 150dpi PDF version so you can print it out at home. Delivery method depends on the size.</p>
<p>Pick-up will also be available at my Phoenix ComiCon booth 1843 during the Exibitor Hall hours.</p>
<p><em>Even if I don't make the full amount - if you purchase a book, you will get a book.</em></p>

<p><strong>FAQs</strong></p>
<p><strong>Why do you need so much money?</strong></p>
<p>Nobody likes asking for money. But the fact of the matter is, I can't afford to buy a ton of books with no guarantee that they would sell and end up with a huge pile of books in my studio room. With my recent surgery, vet bills, and laptop death, I need you guys to tell me if this is something you want. And let’s face it, money talks.</p>
<p>The funds will go towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>The costs of producing paperback books,</li>
<li>A replacement laptop since mine ate the dust,</li>
<li>A much-needed software upgrade, and</li>
<li>Whatever's left will go towards various local pet rescue groups.</li>
</ul><p><strong>I have no money! How can I help?</strong></p>
<p>Spread the word! Let everyone know about this campaign and/or my webcomic. Mention it on Twitter or Facebook or wherever people congregate on the internet nowadays.</p>
<p><strong>Will the books be available anywhere else?</strong></p>
<p>Nope. Well, not planning on it. The book will be a LIMITED EDITION run. I will order all the books (plus just a few extra for friends, family, and safe keepings) if and once the goal is reached and will not have a second print. If you guys beg and plead, I might put it up on an on-demand site, but we’ll have to see.</p>

<p>I have been working on this project for over 10 years, since my husband passed away at the age of 24 after battling pediatric bone cancer. During his five-year treatment in a children's oncology ward I watched him use his charisma and charm to give hope to his young friends on the ward. Inspired by his legacy I created this superhero, in the hopes of someday reaching the hearts of all children, especially those who need a bit of light to help them through their times of darkness.</p>

<h3>Teen rabbit pop-punk sensations, THE WRASKLES, are on their way to a gig in Porksburg when their old jalopy tour van breaks down at a spooky crossroads. An old goat challenges them to a musical duel, and after they defeat him, he transforms into a demon and curses them to encounter the supernatural until they can perform a better song than the one played to best him. This sets our series in motion where THE WRASKLES tour around the world searching for pop-punk super-stardom while they fight the dark forces of the musical world.</h3>

<h3>We are looking to print around 750 issues and to fund this as well as the materials for the various tiers of perks and shipping we will need to raise $5,000.00</h3>
<h3>Perks include signed copies of THE WRASKLES CROSSROADS AT PORKSBURG, sketch cards of 7 of the main recurring characters of the series, original artwork drawn by series artist and co-creator Curt Spurging, and stickers.</h3>
<h3>We hope to hit the initial target so that we can keep the price per unit low enough to get the book into our readers hands. If the goal isn't hit we will reassess the number of units needed and the costs required thereafter.</h3>
<h3>One important thing to consider with this campaign is that THE BOOK IS FINISHED and we are hoping to ship approximately 30 days after the campaign is fully funded and closes.

<h3>The Bare Bones:</h3>
<p>So, what is this piratey nonsense all about?</p>
<p>Weaponry is a webcomic that uploads free of charge every Monday, found at <a href=""http://www.otherworldscomics.com/weaponry.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.otherworldscomics.com/weaponry.php</a> as well as on DeviantART and Smackjeeves. It is a Choose Your Own Adventure comic, and a yaoi (or boy's love) tale of adventure, lawlessness and competition on the high seas. The readers are encouraged to voice their two-pennies, debate potential directions the story could go and defend their choices for reactions and pairings based on the canon pages. Then, at the end of every chapter, I offer up three different scenarios - one for each of the three protagonists - and the readers get to choose how they would like the story to continue.</p>
<p>So who am I? My name is Astra Crompton. I'm a working stiff by day, yet by night I write and publish novels, illustrate comics, and do freelance art and craft work. Being able to support myself fully through my art is a dream I'm working hard to fulfill.</p>
<p>Up 'til now, my art has been a welcome though sporadic bonus, but comes no where near to paying the bills. I've funded the start-up costs for Weaponry completely out of pocket, and as of yet there's no real way for me to recoup these costs. I don't have the capitol to get this first run to print, and I'm hoping that if I can get some stock, I might be able to get the comic on its feet, er, Sea Legs.</p>
<p>Not only will your generous donations enable me to print the first run of 100 copies, it will also enable the infrastructure to solidify. How's that exactly? This amount pays for the supplies for the incentives (left overs becoming extra merch) like key-chains, stickers, prints and other extras. It provides much-needed funding for minor advertising to encourage readership and hopefully increase support for this relatively new comic (by ads on Smackjeeves, similar web comics' sites, etc), it also enables the website and Big Cartel sites to continue running smoothly so that everyone can enjoy this story for free.</p>
<p>Weaponry has received glowing compliments from its current readership for its realistic characters, rich colours, compelling writing and delicious character designs. If you already read Weaponry - I thank you. It is your feedback and encouragement that keeps my passion for this project running so high. If you have not yet read the tale, I entreat you to take a moment to read the first chapter and see what it is I'm trying to accomplish first hand. This initial step will set the stage for all the storytelling to come - and I'd love for you to be a part of it!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Your Gold for Me Bounty</h3>
<p>Where does the money go?</p>
<p>$1950 is a modest request for a print endeavour, but every dollar is put to work. It enables:</p>
<p>~<strong>100 copies</strong> to be printed (including shipping from the printer to myself, import and customs duties, and basic shipping costs to send them on to you - if you are in North America)</p>
<p>~The cost of <strong>1 to 2 advertisments</strong> on similar webcomics' sites (I'm looking into Artifice, Teahouse, Tj &amp; Amal, Facebook)</p>
<p>~The cost for <strong>1 year of web hosting</strong> (both my url and web hoster, Big Cartel store website, and Smackjeeves donator account) to increase options and space so that I can offer bigger page display and more goods to you, the reader.</p>
<p>~The cost of the <strong>Incentives and merchandise</strong> that I hope to offer in the shop and at conventions. (This includes colour prints, key-chains, the art supplies for unique art, and one of a kind crafts like plushies and cosplay pieces) plus the cost of using IndieGoGo to facilitate the fundraising.</p>
<p><strong>And for thy generosity ye shall be rewarded!</strong></p>
<p>I've put together some really fun perks for funding this project! Please note that <strong>ALL PERKS STACK</strong>! That's right! <strong>That means you will receive the listed perk for your donation level AS WELL AS EVERYTHING that preceded it!</strong></p>
<p>Obviously, since I'm the sole creator of this comic, I'm also the only one filling the orders (including drawing the unique art and making your craft prizes) so please have patience as I fill all your orders. I'm looking forward to getting to know you during this fundraiser and will try my best to draw you your favourite characters for incentives and on the livestreams while the fundraiser is happening.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that the goal is on the barebones end of the comic funding spectrum, I understand that thus far, Weaponry's reach is small. I know that many of you are much in the same boat as I am, and your boundless love for my comic does nothing to line your pockets. It is a very real possibility that I will not be able to raise the needed funds. If not, cuts will need to be made - the advertising &amp; website fees will be the first to be culled, as much as doing so will hamstring the future of the comic. I will use every raised dollar to ensure all of the incentives are fullfilled, even if it means I need to continue to raise the funds needed to do so, on my own afterwards.</p>
<p>Conversely, if, by some miracle of the Pastafarian Angels, we <strong>EXCEED</strong> the targeted goal - my solemn pledge is that every extra dollar will go to buying more copies of the comic to take around to conventions and sell on the online shop. The revenue from their sales will hopefully fuel the other costs this comic incrues to keep it going for Chapter Two and beyond. I'll also be offering <strong>bonus art</strong> to everyone who has pledged in the form of exclusive wallpapers, gift art, and anything else I can manage to illustrate my overwhelming joy.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Long-Sighted Views</h3>
</div>
<div>Weaponry began in July of 2011. I had no idea if people would enjoy the story, or my art, but in my close circle, it got such a positive response that I wanted to share it. Since then, its readership has constantly surprised and impressed me with their insightful views, varied opinions and diligent support.</div>
<div>It is for that reason above all others that I have not yet missed an update. My dedication to see this project through is iron-clad, with the willing sacrifice of sleep and other personal projects to ensure the updates go up on time with consistent quality. I treat the comic as a dream job - because I wish that someday it could be my official line of work.</div>
<div>Keeping the audience involved in directing the story prevents me from getting carried away - from planning too far ahead and developing machiavellian plots that I could never possibly execute in my lifetime. We are fuel to each others' fires, and every new reader only builds my enthusiasm.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>Be on the Lookout!</h3>
<p>There are many more ways you can help Weaponry become a success. Whether you are able to contribute your hard-earned treasure to the chest or not, I would wholly appreciate your assistance with the following:</p>
<p>~ <strong>Spread the word!</strong> Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Y!Gallery, DeviantART, Smackjeeves, messageboards, classrooms, chatrooms, forums, blackboards, emails, quill and ink!! Any method at your disposal to share your love and support of Weaponry is the best gift I could receive. Word of mouth advertising is the least expensive yet most effective method out there.

</div></div>","The Bare Bones:
So, what is this piratey nonsense all about?
Weaponry is a webcomic that uploads free of charge every Monday, found at http://www.otherworldscomics.com/weaponry.php as well as on DeviantART and Smackjeeves. It is a Choose Your Own Adventure comic, and a yaoi (or boy's love) tale of adventure, lawlessness and competition on the high seas. The readers are encouraged to voice their two-pennies, debate potential directions the story could go and defend their choices for reactions and pairings based on the canon pages. Then, at the end of every chapter, I offer up three different scenarios - one for each of the three protagonists - and the readers get to choose how they would like the story to continue.
So who am I? My name is Astra Crompton. I'm a working stiff by day, yet by night I write and publish novels, illustrate comics, and do freelance art and craft work. Being able to support myself fully through my art is a dream I'm working hard to fulfill.
Up 'til now, my art has been a welcome though sporadic bonus, but comes no where near to paying the bills. I've funded the start-up costs for Weaponry completely out of pocket, and as of yet there's no real way for me to recoup these costs. I don't have the capitol to get this first run to print, and I'm hoping that if I can get some stock, I might be able to get the comic on its feet, er, Sea Legs.
Not only will your generous donations enable me to print the first run of 100 copies, it will also enable the infrastructure to solidify. How's that exactly? This amount pays for the supplies for the incentives (left overs becoming extra merch) like key-chains, stickers, prints and other extras. It provides much-needed funding for minor advertising to encourage readership and hopefully increase support for this relatively new comic (by ads on Smackjeeves, similar web comics' sites, etc), it also enables the website and Big Cartel sites to continue running smoothly so that everyone can enjoy this story for free.
Weaponry has received glowing compliments from its current readership for its realistic characters, rich colours, compelling writing and delicious character designs. If you already read Weaponry - I thank you. It is your feedback and encouragement that keeps my passion for this project running so high. If you have not yet read the tale, I entreat you to take a moment to read the first chapter and see what it is I'm trying to accomplish first hand. This initial step will set the stage for all the storytelling to come - and I'd love for you to be a part of it!


Your Gold for Me Bounty
Where does the money go?
$1950 is a modest request for a print endeavour, but every dollar is put to work. It enables:
~100 copies to be printed (including shipping from the printer to myself, import and customs duties, and basic shipping costs to send them on to you - if you are in North America)
~The cost of 1 to 2 advertisments on similar webcomics' sites (I'm looking into Artifice, Teahouse, Tj & Amal, Facebook)
~The cost for 1 year of web hosting (both my url and web hoster, Big Cartel store website, and Smackjeeves donator account) to increase options and space so that I can offer bigger page display and more goods to you, the reader.
~The cost of the Incentives and merchandise that I hope to offer in the shop and at conventions. (This includes colour prints, key-chains, the art supplies for unique art, and one of a kind crafts like plushies and cosplay pieces) plus the cost of using IndieGoGo to facilitate the fundraising.
And for thy generosity ye shall be rewarded!
I've put together some really fun perks for funding this project! Please note that ALL PERKS STACK! That's right! That means you will receive the listed perk for your donation level AS WELL AS EVERYTHING that preceded it!
Obviously, since I'm the sole creator of this comic, I'm also the only one filling the orders (including drawing the unique art and making your craft prizes) so please have patience as I fill all your orders. I'm looking forward to getting to know you during this fundraiser and will try my best to draw you your favourite characters for incentives and on the livestreams while the fundraiser is happening.
Despite the fact that the goal is on the barebones end of the comic funding spectrum, I understand that thus far, Weaponry's reach is small. I know that many of you are much in the same boat as I am, and your boundless love for my comic does nothing to line your pockets. It is a very real possibility that I will not be able to raise the needed funds. If not, cuts will need to be made - the advertising & website fees will be the first to be culled, as much as doing so will hamstring the future of the comic. I will use every raised dollar to ensure all of the incentives are fullfilled, even if it means I need to continue to raise the funds needed to do so, on my own afterwards.
Conversely, if, by some miracle of the Pastafarian Angels, we EXCEED the targeted goal - my solemn pledge is that every extra dollar will go to buying more copies of the comic to take around to conventions and sell on the online shop. The revenue from their sales will hopefully fuel the other costs this comic incrues to keep it going for Chapter Two and beyond. I'll also be offering bonus art to everyone who has pledged in the form of exclusive wallpapers, gift art, and anything else I can manage to illustrate my overwhelming joy.


Long-Sighted Views

Weaponry began in July of 2011. I had no idea if people would enjoy the story, or my art, but in my close circle, it got such a positive response that I wanted to share it. Since then, its readership has constantly surprised and impressed me with their insightful views, varied opinions and diligent support.
It is for that reason above all others that I have not yet missed an update. My dedication to see this project through is iron-clad, with the willing sacrifice of sleep and other personal projects to ensure the updates go up on time with consistent quality. I treat the comic as a dream job - because I wish that someday it could be my official line of work.
Keeping the audience involved in directing the story prevents me from getting carried away - from planning too far ahead and developing machiavellian plots that I could never possibly execute in my lifetime. We are fuel to each others' fires, and every new reader only builds my enthusiasm.
 

Be on the Lookout!
There are many more ways you can help Weaponry become a success. Whether you are able to contribute your hard-earned treasure to the chest or not, I would wholly appreciate your assistance with the following:
~ Spread the word! Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Y!Gallery, DeviantART, Smackjeeves, messageboards, classrooms, chatrooms, forums, blackboards, emails, quill and ink!! Any method at your disposal to share your love and support of Weaponry is the best gift I could receive. Word of mouth advertising is the least expensive yet most effective method out there. If you know anyone you think might like Weaponry - please, encourage them to read the comic, tell them about the fundraiser. This is not only a chance to get Chapter One to print, it's a chance to spread the love of the comic itself.
~ IndieGoGo has a number of helpful tools to make it easy to share this fundraiser at the mere click of a button! You can also embed the Livestream video into any html supporting website or forum you use.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to view this campaign. My name is <i>Savannah Houston-McIntyre</i>, and I am the writer and producer of <i><a href=""http://www.amyachronicles.com/archives/117"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">Amya</a></i>. I work alongside my co-writer <i>Andrew Hewitt</i>, as well as our illustrator <i>Rebecca Gunter</i>.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Amya is a high-fantasy graphic novel that my comrades and I have dedicated our time and skill to publishing since September 2009, though the story began years prior. We consider Amya much more than a hobby, it is a <i>passion</i>.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><br/></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">In the first two chapters ""Unexpected Meeting"" and ""The Monster of Erishore"", we followed the adventures of a mute spell-touched and her unlikely companions as they were pulled into an adventure that was greater than any of them could have anticipated; or ever expect to fulfill.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><br/></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The third installment ""Conflict at Deepwall"", focuses on unwrapping the mystery surrounding Faye and her purpose to the story. We will meet new villains and find new friends as Faye discovers she is to be the saviour of a world she has been segregated from since birth. This will lead to her biggest ultimatum through the series: Does she want to sacrifice her own humanity for the world -- or the world for her humanity?<br/><br/></p>

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">As an independent publisher, printing comics at the level of quality that readers expect is financially challenging. We had fantastic support from our readers towards the print run of Chapter Two, and the campaign was a success. Chapter Three is the largest of the series to date at 76 pages; therefore the production cost is higher than the previous issues. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><br/></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Because of recent medical concerns involving myself and continuing medical concerns surrounding my son, I have not been able to supply as much funding for the project from my own pockets as I have in the past. To compile these pages into a solid format that you can hold and cherish - we will once again need your help.<br/></p>
<br/>It is my hope that you will help me raise $2,500 of the cost to print Chapter Three. Anything we raise above that amount will aid in printing the project sooner, or add to the amount we are able to print.</div><div><br/></div><div><p><img align=""none"" alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.amyachronicles.com/images/indie/halfbanner.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p></div>

<h3>Juarez, Mexico  </h3>
<p>In a gritty, soulless border town that smells of blood, sex, and liquor, there's no real honest way to make a living. I only had two choices in life -- become the cartel's instrument of death or end up the next decapitated message hanging from an overpass. </p>
<p>Working for the Castaneda Cartel transformed me into the perfect killer.  Cold. Calculating. Uncaring. I was truly a heartless messenger for evil men.  </p>

<p>Together, we fled this hell and disappeared into the safety of America. We had two wonderful years together as a family... until the cartel forced me to return to the blood-soaked past I'd left behind and use my tools to issue vengeance on men I once called ""brothers"".</p>

</h2>
<p>Written by <strong>Erik Burnham</strong> (<i>Ghostbusters, Chastity</i>) and drawn by <strong>Jonathan Lau</strong> (<i>Green Hornet</i>), the past meets the present with the future of literally everything at stake! The warrior Red Sonja has a plan to keep freshly killed wizard Kulan Gath from resurrecting himself again -- but when the plan backfires, it allows a whole new kind of Chaos! to infest the Hyborean Age! Will these new beings be any easier to deal with than Kulan Gath, or has Sonja called a worse evil to her world? It's the first chapter of a brand-new quest for the She-Devil - and it may be her hardest yet as for the first time ever, Red Sonja meets the badass characters of Chaos!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Comic Watch</strong> said ""these characters are visual powerhouses that allow so many great opportunities for the creative talent to shine. While Sakkara definitely steals the spotlight, each of the Chaos characters bring their own unique flair that matches up with Red Sonja’s aesthetic quite well.""</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Sequential Planet</strong> said: ""...the action is great and fans of Chaos! comics will love it. I think the sense of humour and willingness to poke fun at itself was brilliant and I’m sold on the series.""</p>

About Red Sonja: Age of Chaos

Written by Erik Burnham (Ghostbusters, Chastity) and drawn by Jonathan Lau (Green Hornet), the past meets the present with the future of literally everything at stake! The warrior Red Sonja has a plan to keep freshly killed wizard Kulan Gath from resurrecting himself again -- but when the plan backfires, it allows a whole new kind of Chaos! to infest the Hyborean Age! Will these new beings be any easier to deal with than Kulan Gath, or has Sonja called a worse evil to her world? It's the first chapter of a brand-new quest for the She-Devil - and it may be her hardest yet as for the first time ever, Red Sonja meets the badass characters of Chaos!
Comic Watch said ""these characters are visual powerhouses that allow so many great opportunities for the creative talent to shine. While Sakkara definitely steals the spotlight, each of the Chaos characters bring their own unique flair that matches up with Red Sonja’s aesthetic quite well.""
Sequential Planet said: ""...the action is great and fans of Chaos! comics will love it. I think the sense of humour and willingness to poke fun at itself was brilliant and I’m sold on the series.""

<p><strong>Requiem of the Crazies</strong> tells the story a man named Dante, who after losing his job and home, is cast out of his mundane life and into the strange underground world of the homeless. Being mentored by a veteran bum named Vernon, our two protagonists begin to uncover a dark reality about the homeless community in which they live. That it’s slowly falling under the control of an insidious maniacal cult leader who is drugging their food and water supply, manipulating the minds of the homeless so they carry out his nefarious evil bidding. In order to stop this madman’s plot, Dante and Vern will have to face off against <strong>corrupt police, drug dealers, satanic gangs, and a rising epidemic of cannibalism</strong>.  </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm a professional graphic designer and have been an active member of the Montréal comic book scene for over 20 years. I've published 5 small press comics in the past. Although these were fun projects, I have been yearning to produce a high-quality colour book.</p>
<p>My current project, the <a href=""http://tfti.inkorpora.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Tales from the Interface</i> webcomic</a>, has received a ton of positive feedback and upon multiple requests, I am now planning to print the first 3 chapters in this first issue. This includes pages which are not yet on the website. </p>
<p>If, like me, you love classic science-fiction, fantasy and horror, you will love <i>Tales from the Interface</i>! I'm really looking forward to holding in my hands the first issue of <i>Tales from the Interface</i>. This first book will contain over <strong>40 highly-detailed pages of comics as well as bonuses such as illustrations, tips and tricks... </strong></p>

Just wanted to let you guys know that I just got the proof from the printer. On first inspection it looks amazing. So thank you again for making this come true!

 
 
Short Summary
I'm a professional graphic designer and have been an active member of the Montréal comic book scene for over 20 years. I've published 5 small press comics in the past. Although these were fun projects, I have been yearning to produce a high-quality colour book.
My current project, the Tales from the Interface webcomic, has received a ton of positive feedback and upon multiple requests, I am now planning to print the first 3 chapters in this first issue. This includes pages which are not yet on the website. 
If, like me, you love classic science-fiction, fantasy and horror, you will love Tales from the Interface! I'm really looking forward to holding in my hands the first issue of Tales from the Interface. This first book will contain over 40 highly-detailed pages of comics as well as bonuses such as illustrations, tips and tricks... 




 
Why should you back this project?
This initial funding will be used to print a first run of the comic. I am also offering signed books with doodles or full-fledged commissions. There is no risk to you: even if I don't reach my goal, I pledge to fulfill all orders made during the indiegogo campaign. I need to print a reasonable number of copies to meet my target price, but if I don't get enough orders on this page, I will assume part of the cost myself and sell the remaining comics in stores and conventions.

 
Bonuses
The book will contain a ton of bonus content.

Unreleased illustrations from various projects
Tips and tricks on frequently asked questions such as resolution, process of creating a page, silhouetting and much more...

<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Issue 1- “The Attack of Asgard”</span></strong></p>
<p>Asgard has been attacked, ravaged by the Dark Elves; it means war. Thor, stranded and stripped of most of his powers, must fight through The Nine Realms, reclaim his powers and save his family members, warped and controlled by the Dark Elves themselves. The forces of the Realms are at stake.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Issue 2- “Heavens fall from Earth”</span></strong></p>
<p>Asgard lies in ruins, and Thor finds no clues as to where the Dark Elves have vanished. In despair, he heads for Vanaheim to meet his friends. But when it too comes under attack, he uses his mighty strength and new powers to defeat those foes and capture one of the Elfish hordes. After getting the information needed, he learns that the Aesir are being made sickly and are losing their great strength. Thor fights to restore them, but it is of no use as the Dark Elves invade the gates and enter Midgard, calling it “The Great Feast of the World Eater.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Issue 3- “Thor, Defender of Earth”</span></strong></p>
<p>Thor has a different plan and successfully repels the Dark Elves from Midgard, rescuing humanity in the process. He spends the night there to replenish his energy when he hears the calling of the Frost Giants and leaves for Jotunheim in a flash.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Issue 4- “Broken Family”</span></strong></p>
<p>At Jotunheim, he finds not only hundreds of dead Frost Giants but an enraged Ysmir, the leader of the Frost Giants, blaming Thor for the death of his city. After defeating Ysmir, Thor vows vengeance on the Dark Elves and swears to never stop fighting until he finds the source of all this chaos.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Issue 5- “The Demons Wake”</span></strong></p>
<p>He heads to Muspelheim, Land of the Demons. He confronts Surtur here, looking for information on the Dark Elves’ plans. Thor learns that they wish to destroy Aesir and recreate the world in their image. After he defeats Surtur’s hordes, he seeks the help of the wise Dwarves at Nidavellir.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Issue 6 - “The Echo of Stonewall Mountains”</span></strong></p>
<p>Nidavellir is attacked by the Dark Elves also, signifying to Thor that something must be following him but is strangely always one step in advance. He is given new abilities and great technology by the Dwarves, and he prepares himself for one last stop before he reaches the Dark Elves.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Issue 7- “To Hel and Back”</span></strong></p>
<p>He visits Hel, the Underworld, and wishes for great power by Death herself. After proving himself in combat, she grants him never-ending life, at the cost that he may never enter paradise and will have to fight the World Eater to prove himself worthy at Ragnarok.</p>

<p>Our mission is to raise money for these comic books and matching mobile applications. We want people not only to read the comics but to become the Hero/Heroine of the story. In the comic books we will go deeper into the origin stories of these heroes and learn how they activated their own Natural Powers and changed their universe.</p>
<p><strong>We are all born with these Natural Powers! Although not as exaggerated as we see in commercial comics and movies, they are still just as EXTRAORDINARY none-the-less.</strong></p>

<p><strong>My name is Andrew Morrissey, my friends call me <a href=""http://universalheroes.org/heros/mr-m-2/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mr. M.</a> </strong></p>
<p>I am the co-director of the <a href=""http://www.universalheroes.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Universal Heroes</a> which is a non-profit organisation dedicated to activating heroes. Here is a sample of my work with D'jedi hero <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=wDV6QRsLz5A"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">David Beaudry.</a> <span>I have been lucky in my life I have trained with some of the best Martial Artists, Yogis, Tibetan Monks, D'jedi's and Masters of the Force. With over 18 years of training experience I recently turned my talents to finding other real life heroes.</span></p>
<p>This is my first solo project since the successful creation of the Universal Heroes and I am really excited by the possibilities. I have been travelling the world for the last three years searching for a league of heroes who were just waiting for their stories to be revealed.</p>
<h3><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/medias/939036/pictures/full/20130720052644-Page_1_7.jpg?1374323206"" src="""" style=""font-size: 10px;""/></h3>
<p><strong>The idea came to me after I had just started up the <a href=""http://www.universalheroes.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Universal Heroes</a>. </strong></p>
<p><span>While randomly searching on YouTube, I came across Stan Lee's </span><a href=""http://www.history.com/shows/stan-lees-superhumans"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Super-Humans</a><span> and the </span><a href=""http://www.reallifesuperheroes.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Real Life Super Hero Project</a><span>. </span><span>Then I realized that this was the birth of a global movement, the Comic Book culture had been preparing us with the Super Hero Mythos to empower</span><span> ordinary citizens to take control of their Universe.</span></p>
<p><strong>Then I had what alcoholics like to call 'A Moment of Clarity.' I need to make a COMIC BOOK<span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">! </span></strong></p>
<p>In a Flash of Brilliance I had discovered my Next Mission here on Planet Earth. Through this clarity I then began to organize my 18 years of experience into a story which I have almost completed. This will be the very first ever interactive comic book that allows you to train along side your favourite heroes and learn how to unlock your Natural Powers, tapping into your unlimited potential.</p>

<h2><strong>THANK YOU! PLEASE SHARE &amp; COMMENT.</strong></h2></div>","THE HIDDEN HERO COMIC BOOK & MOBILE APP


The Hidden Hero is a Comic Book that get's you actively involved in the Heroes Journey. The comic book gives instant access to the reader who can train along side the Heroes and learn how to activate their own Natural Powers with Mobile Applications.
Now thanks to this crowdfunder we will have the opportunity to share their stories with all of YOU! That's where you all come in. Help us to co-create these Real Life Comic Book adventures.
1. DONATE! The karma of Donating will be felt instantly for supporting real life heroes and their remarkable stories.
2. Get your friends and family to donate! The whole community can get involved and everyones a winner!
3. BLAST this on FaceBook, Twitter and other Social Networks. It's high time we take control of our community to once again be in balance with the Forces of Nature.

Our mission is to raise money for these comic books and matching mobile applications. We want people not only to read the comics but to become the Hero/Heroine of the story. In the comic books we will go deeper into the origin stories of these heroes and learn how they activated their own Natural Powers and changed their universe.
We are all born with these Natural Powers! Although not as exaggerated as we see in commercial comics and movies, they are still just as EXTRAORDINARY none-the-less.

My name is Andrew Morrissey, my friends call me Mr. M. 
I am the co-director of the Universal Heroes which is a non-profit organisation dedicated to activating heroes. Here is a sample of my work with D'jedi hero David Beaudry. I have been lucky in my life I have trained with some of the best Martial Artists, Yogis, Tibetan Monks, D'jedi's and Masters of the Force. With over 18 years of training experience I recently turned my talents to finding other real life heroes.
This is my first solo project since the successful creation of the Universal Heroes and I am really excited by the possibilities. I have been travelling the world for the last three years searching for a league of heroes who were just waiting for their stories to be revealed.

The idea came to me after I had just started up the Universal Heroes. 
While randomly searching on YouTube, I came across Stan Lee's Super-Humans and the Real Life Super Hero Project. Then I realized that this was the birth of a global movement, the Comic Book culture had been preparing us with the Super Hero Mythos to empower ordinary citizens to take control of their Universe.
Then I had what alcoholics like to call 'A Moment of Clarity.' I need to make a COMIC BOOK! 
In a Flash of Brilliance I had discovered my Next Mission here on Planet Earth. Through this clarity I then began to organize my 18 years of experience into a story which I have almost completed. This will be the very first ever interactive comic book that allows you to train along side your favourite heroes and learn how to unlock your Natural Powers, tapping into your unlimited potential.

In issue #1 we are introduced to Red Phoenix: Andrea Sullivan. Dr D: David Beaudry. Deva-Liminal: Jami Deva.
In The Hidden Hero issue #1 we will explore the defining moment when Mr M fully-activated his D'jedi Mind Training with his masters in China Town for 7 years. We will film the first Mobile Application 'D'jedi Activation' in Angkor Watt, Cambodia.
D'jedi Activation: The D’Jedi Activation is a training to unlock the codes of Self-Mastery within. We utilize ancient practices and modern technology, to re-boot and “Wake Up” inside the matrix, with full remembrance of who we are, and our Mission here on Planet Earth.

This style of story telling using real life heroes and interactive mobile applications to learn their special powers has never been attempted before and that's what makes this project so unique and EXCITING! 

Your contributions for this crowdfunder will go directly to the costs of creating the comic book, T-shirt printing, mobile application development and expenses for our crew to travel to these exotic locations. The cost of our comic book artists and printing stands at $6000 and the travelling expenses the crew need to film these mobile applications is $6000.
If we move past the crowdfunding amount then we will put the extra funds towards the creation of issue #1 #2 #3. I currently have a list of 10 Heroes that I would like to work with from around the world and I would be honoured if you would allow our team to tell their remarkable stories. 
Here is a sample below from Gabriel Santiago. We will be updating NEW Drawings every week as the Campaign HEATS UP!

The Hidden Hero issue #2. 
In issue two we will go deeper into the origin stories of Red Phoenix: Andrea Sullivan. Andrea has been training in the ancient Ninja and Universal Healing Arts since the age of 5. This episode we will track Andrea to her birth place in The USA. Also we will film another mobile application at Angkor Watt in Cambodia. This will expose us to Andrea's unique abilities with Phoenix Healing and the 5 Elemental Qigong Forms.

The Hidden Hero issue #3.
let's keep revealing these amazing HEROES!!! This stretch goal will unlock the stories and mysteries surrounding Deva-Liminal: Jami Deva. We will go deeper into the origin story of Jami's training and promotional tours with one of the largest touring groups on the planet, the Supreme Science Qigong Foundation. We will travel to Bali, Indonesia to film the iPhone/Android Application to share his amazing Talents in the D'jedi Arts.

The Hidden Hero Documentary.
In this stretch goal I will create a documentary of the Hidden Hero. I will travel with our Crew back to the USA and track Down more Hidden Heroes. Also we will go deeper with the Origin story of David Beaudry and track his progress as he activates the modern day D'jedi with his Team in the USA.

ideals we know, and entering into a primal world of the Viseratta.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/482158/files/20140403153023-julieindi.jpg?1396564223"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>Viseratta is a paranormal
tale of a transformation into darkness, horror, strength and the
truth about the humanity. The true nature of what we are and what we
can become, there is always a choice.</p><p>Ari has always been
different but after a series of unexplainable terrifying events she
comes face to face with what she truly is. For Ari and her friends,
life as they know it will never be the same, when they get pulled
into a world were nothing and no one is what they seem.</p>
<p>As the darkness clears and
the secrets of the Viseratta unfold, they face the deadly creatures

The Author:</b></p>
<p>Fantasy Artist
 <b>Ellen Griffin</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>Born on the New Jersey
shore early enough to remember the 80's and big hair days and smart
enough to hide all those embarrassing pictures. Then transplanted to
the good ole' southern State of  Virginia. 
</p>
<p>Currently a fantasy art
artist and author, which is a pretty cool gig considering the fact
she can change people into most any type of creature in a digital
picture. However, one should not forget the not so hilarious sarcasm
of hiding people of whom she has had differences with in her books.
While most do make for some very interesting characters they do seem
to meet some unusual fates. It does, however, make for some good
reads!</p>

Enter
into the world of the Viseratta, the first Comic book edition by
Ellen Griffin based off the Viseratta series.There
are unexplainable things that happen in this world, these are the
things that change us forever 

 The
Viseratta Series
 By
Ellen Griffin
There
are things in this world we will never understand, in darkness there
is a madness that overtakes all human instinct. Leaving behind the
ideals we know, and entering into a primal world of the Viseratta.Viseratta is a paranormal
tale of a transformation into darkness, horror, strength and the
truth about the humanity. The true nature of what we are and what we
can become, there is always a choice.Ari has always been
different but after a series of unexplainable terrifying events she
comes face to face with what she truly is. For Ari and her friends,
life as they know it will never be the same, when they get pulled
into a world were nothing and no one is what they seem.
As the darkness clears and
the secrets of the Viseratta unfold, they face the deadly creatures
forged from fire, in an epic struggle that spans several generations
between humans and demons.

About
The Author:
Fantasy Artist
 Ellen Griffin

Born on the New Jersey
shore early enough to remember the 80's and big hair days and smart
enough to hide all those embarrassing pictures. Then transplanted to
the good ole' southern State of  Virginia. 

Currently a fantasy art
artist and author, which is a pretty cool gig considering the fact
she can change people into most any type of creature in a digital
picture. However, one should not forget the not so hilarious sarcasm
of hiding people of whom she has had differences with in her books.
While most do make for some very interesting characters they do seem
to meet some unusual fates. It does, however, make for some good
reads!

About
The Comic Artist:
Comic
Artist  Daniel Kelly

We have no idea where he
came from. He originally just showed up one day to sing in a band.
Currently, a Graphic Artist with a taste  and flare for Anime Art.
Daniel was brought in to
balance out the Viseratta Comic art, mixing the Heavy Metal style
with Fantasy and Anime to make for a very interesting finished
product.
He is currently banned
from using any squid or octopus in the finished product.

What
We Need & What You GetAll
of the work required to create the Viseratta Comic is currently being
done and some initial work has already been completed. Our next shoot

print and manufacture the finished product. Our target is to raise
$2,400.00 to make The Viseratta
Comic a
reality.

cost break-down is:



		Printing
		- Layouts - Art= $1,400.00



		Costs

Now you have the chance to become part of that heroic quest, the journey of immortality, by remembering - The Nobility of our Irish Heroes.</p><p><b>The second coming</b> ... As some of you may know, this campaign is our second in the wave of funding needed for the production of the Finn McCool graphic novel series. In 2013 we raised a fantastic $12,501 from Irish Celtic fans the world over, with donations from eight different countries, from $5 to a staggering $5000. This is the passion that others saw in our vision to bring the greatest warrior ancient Ireland ever knew onto the world platform of heroes. Now YOU have the chance to make a stand as they have, by helping us recreate the magic of the Irish celtic world.

Finn and The Fianna's heroic adventures and deeds are well known within the Irish community and if you reference, Finn McCool, you will see, not only the vast amount of links to his mythology, but also the many pubs, restaurants, organizations and clubs, that celebrate his noble name. What you will not see, is the Graphic Novel of the hero, that, my friends, is about to change. </p><p><b>The time has come</b> to honour our ancient Irish heroes and in the highest way possible - by putting their fine names on the lips of true clansmen and women the world over. Part of our vision for the novel is for young men and women to read them, as well as adults, to learn more about their heritage, rites of passage and initiations into adulthood, something we feel is sadly lacking in today's world. </p><p><b>The stories of Finn McCool</b> do just that, they teach. This is part of the drive behind the graphic novel series, also to showcase the real heroes of our past, rather than the constant ""Superman v Batman"" overkill. This is an original project, a one off, you can be part of this fantastic journey.</p><p><b>We are producing</b> of the Hardcover Original Graphic Novel, featuring the retelling of Finn’s origin. In order to hire the best writers, pencillers, inkers, colourists and letterers in the business to bring this vision to life, we need your support. Our plan is to raise the money to be able to hire top-notch creative talent from the comic and graphic novel field and to partner with an American Comic Book publisher, Archaia, in order to distribute the graphic novel to comic and bookstores across the world.  </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/326014/files/20131130101303-Fiacuil_colour-lighter.jpg?1390513318"" src="""" style=""width: 285.55454545454546px; height: 404px;""/>  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/326028/files/20131130101619-Goll_colour_-lighter_-_Version_2.jpg?1390513471"" src="""" style=""width: 274.87861271676303px; height: 403px;""/></p><p></p><b>Above we see Fiacuil</b>, Finn's warrior mentor and the dreaded, <b>Goll Mc Morna</b>, the man who murders Finn's father, a conflict indeed!<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/326036/files/20131205205728-Saba_005.jpg?1390513797"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><b>Above is Saba </b>Priestess of the underworld and Finn's true love.

Please see the perk bar for details. *Please note: Travel and accommodation expenses are not included and postage outside of the USA must be added if you are claiming a perk that requires postage.</p><p><b>What's in a name?</b> There's a very interesting fact about the hero, did you know that there's at least seven different spellings of his name? This has come about over thousands of years, the stories became legends, the legends became myths. Here's the names we know of: Finn McCool ... Fionn Mac Cum Hail ... Finn McCuail ... Fionn McCumhail ... Fyn Mc Cuail ... Fionn McCual ... Finn McCuail. Some say that his name is spelt ""Fionn"" but that would make it the modern spelling, others say ""Finn"" the old way. So, what we decided to do was to offer the hero's name so that EVERYBODY can read and pronounce it, an inclusive spelling, hence ... ""Finn McCool"". Now, for all of the die-hard Gaelic fan's of the hero, we will also be producing a limited edition version, with all of the names, and there are many, spelt in the ancient Irish Gaelic. If that's the copy you'd like, then please just email and let us know. You can do so via this page when you preorder your copy of the graphic novel. </p><p>What happens if we don't reach our total goal? We will continue the project come what may by STARTING, we can still hire the artists and even begin by creating a soft copy of the stories.

<p></p></div>","For the first time in hundreds of years, Finn's legend is retold. Forged anew from the breath of the storyteller, but this time it's different... This time the fireside is the modern world. This time, it's in the form of a Graphic Novel. Now you have the chance to become part of that heroic quest, the journey of immortality, by remembering - The Nobility of our Irish Heroes.The second coming ... As some of you may know, this campaign is our second in the wave of funding needed for the production of the Finn McCool graphic novel series. In 2013 we raised a fantastic $12,501 from Irish Celtic fans the world over, with donations from eight different countries, from $5 to a staggering $5000. This is the passion that others saw in our vision to bring the greatest warrior ancient Ireland ever knew onto the world platform of heroes. Now YOU have the chance to make a stand as they have, by helping us recreate the magic of the Irish celtic world. But firstly, for those of you who may not know, who was Finn McCool?Finn was the legendary protector of Ireland and Chief of The Fianna, the elite bodyguard to the High Kings of Ireland. Finn and The Fianna's heroic adventures and deeds are well known within the Irish community and if you reference, Finn McCool, you will see, not only the vast amount of links to his mythology, but also the many pubs, restaurants, organizations and clubs, that celebrate his noble name. What you will not see, is the Graphic Novel of the hero, that, my friends, is about to change. The time has come to honour our ancient Irish heroes and in the highest way possible - by putting their fine names on the lips of true clansmen and women the world over. Part of our vision for the novel is for young men and women to read them, as well as adults, to learn more about their heritage, rites of passage and initiations into adulthood, something we feel is sadly lacking in today's world. The stories of Finn McCool do just that, they teach. This is part of the drive behind the graphic novel series, also to showcase the real heroes of our past, rather than the constant ""Superman v Batman"" overkill. This is an original project, a one off, you can be part of this fantastic journey.We are producing of the Hardcover Original Graphic Novel, featuring the retelling of Finn’s origin. In order to hire the best writers, pencillers, inkers, colourists and letterers in the business to bring this vision to life, we need your support. Our plan is to raise the money to be able to hire top-notch creative talent from the comic and graphic novel field and to partner with an American Comic Book publisher, Archaia, in order to distribute the graphic novel to comic and bookstores across the world.    Above we see Fiacuil, Finn's warrior mentor and the dreaded, Goll Mc Morna, the man who murders Finn's father, a conflict indeed!Above is Saba Priestess of the underworld and Finn's true love. Saba first comes to Finn in the form of a white deer, cursed so by the dark lord of the underworld. Finn lifts the curse and we see here, Saba transformed back into the beautiful woman she is.Below is the magical druid Finegas, another wise mentor of Finn's. He teaches Finn the value of the earth and the magic that she holds. Finegas also catches the fames, ""Salomon of knowledge.""""You've seen the Movies 'Braveheart', 'Rob Roy', 'Highlander' and recently, the Pixar animation, 'Brave'.  All great and have one thing in common; they're Scottish. The magic, power and beauty that is Irish Story and Myth has seemingly been overlooked by Hollywood and the world, but not any longer - Irish legends and its Heroes deserve a place in our hearts with the graphic novel and up on the Big Screen.Below we see the Boy Finn's first day of warrior initiation with his wild mentor, Fiacuil.This ground breaking project will lead the way in the reemergence of the Irish Celtic Warrior Heroes. It will become part of your story, your history, not only for you, but for your ancestors. By honouring them, you honour the past, by honouring the past, you become the hero ...Below we see Finn's first encounter with the magical druid, Finegas.Together we can forge a new wave of Heroes ... and this time it's IRISH and the Greatest Irish Hero there ever was, Finn McCool. Below we see the moment that Finn is forced to face death, in more ways than one .           ""When you are dust, how will you be remembered?""By supporting this project you will literally create for yourself, and kin, a lasting legacy that you can feel deeply proud of. Part of what the Finn McCool stories stand for, is the mentoring and initiation of our youth. Providing young people with safe, integral and beautiful settings for them to explore their own personal power, while being mentored onto the pathway of adulthood by trustworthy mentor figures. The producer of the Finn McCool Project, supports the Irish Youth Foundation charity. The mission of IYF is to provide opportunities for children and young people facing adverse and extreme conditions to experience success in their lives. A percentage of profits made from the graphic novel of Finn McCool, will be donated to this inspiring charity based in Dublin, Ireland.Below are seven images from Courtney Davis' art pack for this campaign. They are copies of original art from the Finn McCool's story. We are offering these as a part of perk donations. Please view listings on the right hand side of the campaign for more details.Totally one off and unique ... Should you choose to donate to a perk that comes with a certificate of authenticity, we will do our best to get it to you by Christmas. However, we cannot guarantee the postal system, so we are offering you a downloadable certificate, with your, or the name of the person you are gifting, printed and embossed into the certificate. This will come from our dedicated website, you can then mount or frame the certificate for yourself or a receiver, after all, a part of Irish history is an incredible gift for anyone ...The first wave of funding gets us out into the world with this incredible story, on the Graphic Novel platform. A completed Screenplay for the first film is here, part two is well underway. ""A classic in the action adventure genre, and deserves serious studio consideration."" But here's the thing, we don't want to just give it away to the big studios, we want to produce as much of the project as possible with the help of public funding. By doing so, we retain as much of the story's authenticity as we can. From the Graphic Novel, to the big screen. You are invited on that wild journey of creation, we want you to be a part of one of the finest stories to have ever come out of Ireland ...     The images that you are seeing are from the talents of John Walters, known for his Stunning VFX on the latest Spartacus series for the US STARZ channel and Courtney Davis, the world's leading Celtic illustrator. Their artwork will become the imagery for the Graphic Novel. John's with the graphic page layout and Courtney's with his incredible Irish knot-work which brings in the magic of the Celtic world. Each page will carry with it Finn McCool's legend. From his true love Saba, cursed into the form of a white deer and freed by Finn from her entrapment, to Saint Patrick, in dialogue with Oisin, Finn's son, or the wild druid, Finegas and the many more characters that I'm sure you will love, and if its ""World of Role Play"" you're into, we have some fantastic new characters for you to dream alive.What lifts Finn McCool's stories above the crowd? In truth, reality. Scattered across Ireland are dozens of sacred sites that pre-date the coming of christianity and unlike the make believe world of Tolkien's, ""The Hobbit"" and ""The Lord of The Rings"" who dwell on ""Middle Earth"" (a place that does not exist), the sites across Ireland do.  Many of them include the stories of Finn McCool and the elite bodyguard, the Fianna, protectors of the High Kings of ancient Ireland.              All of the funds will go towards the graphic novel's production, the artwork, writing, lettering, colouring, printing, marketing and distribution. Anything you can offer will help. In return we will offer our deepest gratitude in all kinds of unique perks. Please see the perk bar for details. *Please note: Travel and accommodation expenses are not included and postage outside of the USA must be added if you are claiming a perk that requires postage.What's in a name? There's a very interesting fact about the hero, did you know that there's at least seven different spellings of his name? This has come about over thousands of years, the stories became legends, the legends became myths. Here's the names we know of: Finn McCool ... Fionn Mac Cum Hail ... Finn McCuail ... Fionn McCumhail ... Fyn Mc Cuail ... Fionn McCual ... Finn McCuail. Some say that his name is spelt ""Fionn"" but that would make it the modern spelling, others say ""Finn"" the old way. So, what we decided to do was to offer the hero's name so that EVERYBODY can read and pronounce it, an inclusive spelling, hence ... ""Finn McCool"". Now, for all of the die-hard Gaelic fan's of the hero, we will also be producing a limited edition version, with all of the names, and there are many, spelt in the ancient Irish Gaelic. If that's the copy you'd like, then please just email and let us know. You can do so via this page when you preorder your copy of the graphic novel. What happens if we don't reach our total goal? We will continue the project come what may by STARTING, we can still hire the artists and even begin by creating a soft copy of the stories. We want to invite you to become involved, you are our community, our tribe, we believe that you should have the chance to be a part of this exciting reemergence of the Wild Celt. We'll achieve this through the stories of Finn McCool, and the Fianna.  Finn would have wanted it that way. Real People. Real Project. Real Heart.               An old Irish saying goes:So, com'on, let's you and I dream the Heroes alive, let's breathe anew the old, give fire to the wind, and call the gods to task.

<h3>What is Murder Book?</h3>
<p><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Murder Book</span> is a series of short crime stories written by me, Ed Brisson, and featuring different up-and-coming artists. Past contributing artists have included Simon Roy (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Jan's Atomic Heart, Prophet</span>), Vic Malhotra (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Lucid Proof</span>) and Michael Walsh. Past <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Murder Book </span>stories can be read on the <a href=""http://www.murderbookcomic.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">Murder Book Site</a>.<br/></p>
<p><br/>The term ""Murder Book"" is used by detectives to refer to a case file on a 
homicide investigation. Murder books typically include crime scene 
photographs and sketches, autopsy and forensic reports, transcripts of 
investigatorâ€™s notes and witness interviews. They chronicle the life of a
 case from the time the murder is reported until an arrest is made.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Murder Book Vol. 3</span> will feature the stories <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Midnight Walk</span>, illustrated by Johnnie Christmas and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Fathers and Sons</span>, illustrated by Jason Copland.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Midnight Walk</span> is a 6 page story about a man who happens across a crime scene and tries to help, only to become a victim himself. <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Fathers and Sons</span> is an 18 page tale involving the breakdown of the relationship between two mob men, and the chaos that results. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Generally, I post <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Murder Book </span>stories to the site as they're complete, but in order to entice contributors, I'll hold off posting either story until late May. This way, all contributors will have the stories two months before they're posted online.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If you dig current and gritty crime comics like <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Criminal </span>and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Scalped</span>, then <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Murder Book </span>is your bag!<br/></p>

<p>Johnnie and Jason are currently hard at work on the art so that we can 
debut this sucker at Emerald City Comicon at the end of March. We're 
hoping to have the book to the printer the week this campaign ends and 
everything packaged and mailed to people before the end of March -- 
meaning your perks should start showing up late March/early April.</p>
<br/>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We're looking to raise $1500 to cover the costs of printing the book. The artists have generously agreed to come on board to help with the book, so should there be any funds raised in excess of the printing and shipping costs, then that money will be given to the artists, evenly distributed based on their page counts.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If we fall short of our goal, the book will still be printed and all perks will be fulfilled. I'll just be running up a credit card bill instead.</p>
<p><br/>Every perk includes something physical. I'm looking at this as more of a pre-order/purchase drive than just a ""give us your money"" plea. That said, please spread the word! Tell your friends, family and everyone you see on the street!<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I'm also offering up my lettering services. Check over there on the right. For $250 I'll letter your 22 page comic AND send you a copy of Murder Book #3. You can't beat that with a bat. Need someone to letter your pitch? I can do that too!<br/><br/></p>
<p>Please keep an eye on this campaign,  we will be adding art and other process pieces as the campaign marches on. We may be adding additional perks as well!<br/></p>

I'm also offering up my lettering services. Check over there on the right. For $250 I'll letter your 22 page comic AND send you a copy of Murder Book #3. You can't beat that with a bat. Need someone to letter your pitch? I can do that too!
Please keep an eye on this campaign,  we will be adding art and other process pieces as the campaign marches on. We may be adding additional perks as well!


Other Ways You Can Help
If you're a fan of Murder Book, we'd love for you to help get the word out. Tell your friends, tweet about it. Steal money from your mom's purse and send it to us! We appreciate each and every person who helps us get close to our goal of $1500. Seriously. We love you. Hugs, kisses and all that stuff.

Are You A Retailer?
Retailers, are you interested in helping out? Shoot me an email to edbrissonATgmailDOTcom and let me know. I'll add new pledge levels for retailers based on your input. Multiple copies! Signed! If you're close enough, I'll come out and sign them all for you! If you're further away, we can still work something out!Right now, I do have the ""You Must Be A Crazy Person!"" perk, where I'll bring myself and $2,000 worth of my books to your store, do a signing, go for beers and even spend the weekend working at your shop. Not a bad deal!About Us

<p><strong>Note: Our new goal is to raise at least $500 by the conclusion of our campaign.  Please disregard the stated $10,000 as we now see this amount will not be achieved - however, Petalianne #1 and a children's book edition will still be launched this year!  Thank you for your support :-) <br/></strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Petalianne</strong> is a new 24-page, full color, bi-monthly comic book series published by <a href=""http://www.zelphacomics.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Zelpha Comics Website""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Zelpha Comics</span></a>.  The series has been created for girls ages 5 and up and spotlights the adventures of the lead character Petalianne, her friends the Flower Girls, Queen Azura and Azura’s three guards – Palm, Pine and Cactus.  Issue #1 is slated for non-retail release in December/January and mass release in February 2013. </p>
<p>Petalianne is a cute, fun and funny adventure-filled series with themes and everyday issues young girls can relate to.  Petalianne herself is a spirited, loving and always helpful young girl trying to figure out where she fits in within the magical Gully Forest.  Though she has enormous potential to become the greatest hero the Gully Forest has ever seen, she has self-doubts of her usefulness and can sometimes let her small size, occasional clumsiness and forgetfulness cloud her decisions.  Petalianne might mess things up a lot, but whenever there is trouble, her actions and drive to help others always saves the day. </p>
<p>Living in the same village as Petalianne are her friends The Flower Girls – Lilac, Daisy Lilly, Vine and Tulip.  They all have amazing nature-based abilities and unique personalities that add to the lively dynamic of each story.  There is also Queen Azura Rose, the ruler of the entire Gully Forest, leader of the Flower Girls and protector of the Flower of Life; plus her three loyal guards – Palm, Pine and Cactus.  Together, Petalianne and all her friends defend their home against the mischievous antics of the dreadful Dandelion Bob.  He wants the magical Flower of Life to control all plants and take over the forest.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3 align=""center""><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">The Inspiration behind the Series</span></strong></h3>
<p>Petalianne is the creation of Mississauga, Ontario, Canada writer and game developer Luanga Lue Nuwame and Camas, Washington, U.S.A. creative artist George Leon.  The idea for Petalianne came to Lue after his daughter Azura (his first child) was born on May 27, 2012.  After years of creating trading cards, games and cardboard weapons for boys exclusively on his <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Homemade Game Guru</span> You Tube channel, the birth of Azura inspired Lue to focus his attention on making a comic book and trading card series specifically for girls.  George, also a father to a lovely daughter named Lilly, also felt he needed to do more to create inspiring art for girls.  Lue and George decided to team up to create a fun, wondrous world of characters as positive role models for not only their daughters, but for girls everywhere. </p>
<p>And although Petalianne was created primarily for girls, there is no reason why boys would not enjoy the series too.  Palm, Pine and Cactus are confident and strong main characters boys can relate to.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3 align=""center""><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">What is Needed to get Petalianne to the Next Stage</span></strong></h3>
<p>It is Zelpha Comics’ mission to make Petalianne a bonafide market ready comic book series and your help is needed to make this goal a reality.  Issue #1 is currently being drawn.  What is required is <strong>$500 or more</strong> to help complete issue #1 and have it professionally printed.       </p>
<p>Even if you cannot provide financial backing to this campaign, any <strong>word of mouth</strong> you can provide to friends, family and co-workers is greatly appreciated.  Please share our You Tube, Facebook and website links listed here on Indiegogo.  Every view received helps :-D </p>

Note: Our new goal is to raise at least $500 by the conclusion of our campaign.  Please disregard the stated $10,000 as we now see this amount will not be achieved - however, Petalianne #1 and a children's book edition will still be launched this year!  Thank you for your support :-) 
 
Petalianne is a new 24-page, full color, bi-monthly comic book series published by Zelpha Comics.  The series has been created for girls ages 5 and up and spotlights the adventures of the lead character Petalianne, her friends the Flower Girls, Queen Azura and Azura’s three guards – Palm, Pine and Cactus.  Issue #1 is slated for non-retail release in December/January and mass release in February 2013. 
Petalianne is a cute, fun and funny adventure-filled series with themes and everyday issues young girls can relate to.  Petalianne herself is a spirited, loving and always helpful young girl trying to figure out where she fits in within the magical Gully Forest.  Though she has enormous potential to become the greatest hero the Gully Forest has ever seen, she has self-doubts of her usefulness and can sometimes let her small size, occasional clumsiness and forgetfulness cloud her decisions.  Petalianne might mess things up a lot, but whenever there is trouble, her actions and drive to help others always saves the day. 
Living in the same village as Petalianne are her friends The Flower Girls – Lilac, Daisy Lilly, Vine and Tulip.  They all have amazing nature-based abilities and unique personalities that add to the lively dynamic of each story.  There is also Queen Azura Rose, the ruler of the entire Gully Forest, leader of the Flower Girls and protector of the Flower of Life; plus her three loyal guards – Palm, Pine and Cactus.  Together, Petalianne and all her friends defend their home against the mischievous antics of the dreadful Dandelion Bob.  He wants the magical Flower of Life to control all plants and take over the forest.
 
 
The Inspiration behind the Series
Petalianne is the creation of Mississauga, Ontario, Canada writer and game developer Luanga Lue Nuwame and Camas, Washington, U.S.A. creative artist George Leon.  The idea for Petalianne came to Lue after his daughter Azura (his first child) was born on May 27, 2012.  After years of creating trading cards, games and cardboard weapons for boys exclusively on his Homemade Game Guru You Tube channel, the birth of Azura inspired Lue to focus his attention on making a comic book and trading card series specifically for girls.  George, also a father to a lovely daughter named Lilly, also felt he needed to do more to create inspiring art for girls.  Lue and George decided to team up to create a fun, wondrous world of characters as positive role models for not only their daughters, but for girls everywhere. 
And although Petalianne was created primarily for girls, there is no reason why boys would not enjoy the series too.  Palm, Pine and Cactus are confident and strong main characters boys can relate to.

 
What is Needed to get Petalianne to the Next Stage
It is Zelpha Comics’ mission to make Petalianne a bonafide market ready comic book series and your help is needed to make this goal a reality.  Issue #1 is currently being drawn.  What is required is $500 or more to help complete issue #1 and have it professionally printed.       
Even if you cannot provide financial backing to this campaign, any word of mouth you can provide to friends, family and co-workers is greatly appreciated.  Please share our You Tube, Facebook and website links listed here on Indiegogo.  Every view received helps :-D

It's a 70-page graphic novel full of costumes, romance, misadventures, and some lessons I've learned in my time at AB.

Then I'll debut the book at Conbust in Northampton, Long Island PopCon, and of course, Anime Boston 2015! (Not 2014 as I said in the video, whoops.)

</h3> <p>The goal I'm aiming for with this campaign is <b>$800</b> or more.

</div> <div> <h3>Challenges, more ways to help, and more previews!<br/>

</div></div>","Help me print my first full-length graphic novel!
 Hi, I'm Jenny McKeon! I'm a comic creator and translator based in western MA. Previously, my work has appeared in anthologies like Dirty Diamonds and Restless Minds, and in the webcomic Eerie PD. I've also created minicomics like Blush and Japanese Journal, which I sell at conventions, local shops, and on Gumroad.

You can see more of my work on my art blog or portfolio site! 
Now I'm trying to self-publish my first full book, and I need your help! ABC: Anime Boston Confidential is based on my experiences from attending the same anime convention for the past ten years. It's a 70-page graphic novel full of costumes, romance, misadventures, and some lessons I've learned in my time at AB. The pencils and lettering for the book are complete, and I'm working on finishing the inking and screentones right now. Then I'll debut the book at Conbust in Northampton, Long Island PopCon, and of course, Anime Boston 2015! (Not 2014 as I said in the video, whoops.) You can pick up your copy and other rewards at any of these cons, or have them shipped to you.

In progress in Manga StudioI want this book to be enjoyable for convention newbies and veterans alike - the former can learn from my mistakes, and the latter can laugh at me for them. Even if you're an outsider to convention culture, I hope this book will provide a look into that world, as well as a glimpse of my own personal experiences. A lot can happen in ten years!
  What's all this money for?
 The goal I'm aiming for with this campaign is $800 or more. A print run of 200 books costs $540, shipping them out will cost at least $100, and the rest is for IG and other fees and printing other rewards. Any additional money will go toward convention costs, travel, and printing more copies of the book.

Don't get stuck waiting for your copy!
If we reach the full $800, I'll throw in an original piece of artwork with each physical reward tier! I'll also introduce more stretch goals like bookmarks, bookplates, and so on. (If we don't reach it, I'll be charged more by IG and may have to reduce the size of the print run - but you'll still get the book.) 

  The fun part!
Any pledge of $5 or above gets you a PDF copy of the book shortly after its completion, and $10 or up means you'll receive a physical copy as well! But there's more - higher tiers mean you could get an original commission from me, or even a cameo in the book itself or on the cover!The print/back cover in progress - I left room for you!And if you choose to pick up your book in person (just let me know you'll be attending one of the conventions) instead of having it shipped to you, you'll receive a con-exclusive ABC print!
  Challenges, more ways to help, and more previews!
I already have a printer lined up and a sizeable portion of the book completed. I am in a bit of a time crunch, and will have to work hard to finish the book in time to debut it at AB and the other conventions - but I'm up for the challenge, and you'll receive your books by May even if the worst should happen!

<p>Eight years ago when I started <a href=""http://dailycartoonist.com/?campaign=indiegogo2013&amp;source=indiegogo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Daily Cartoonist (TDC)</a>, I was just hoping to get to year five. The popularity and influence of TDC has surpassed any of my expectations. The media landscape has changed quite a bit in those years. Social Media is the go-to place for news and conversation. Mobile phones and tablet devices are increasingly the screen of choice for staring into for web content. This next year I’m investing heavily with my time and efforts to improve every aspect of the blog from how news is gathered, organized, delivered and read.</p>
<p>My top goals for the blog are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Redesign – This is more than just a lipstick and a pretty bow, Visually, I’m redesigning the site to provide a better experience for both tablet and mobile phones, but architecturally I’ll be moving the blog to a different CMS that has better scalability, security and performance.</li>
<li>Refocus of content – I’m going to simplify the content structure to simply focus on Creators, Publishers, Issues, and Technology. I won’t be cutting back on my current “beat” of print/newspaper based cartooning but expect the circle of creators and publishers to get bigger.</li>
<li>Reorganize my sources – News is moving faster thanks to social media. I’m going to spend a lot of time reevaluating how I gather news and improving filtering genuine news from the noise that is social media.</li>
</ol>
<h3>What do you get out of this?</h3>
<p>At the end of this process (I’m shooting for end of January) The Daily Cartoonist will have more news, be better focused, better sourced and look fantastic on your mobile phone or tablet at 2:00 am (or any other time, really). </p>
<h3>The Rewards</h3>
<p>So each year (okay, mostly every year), I run a NPR-style guilt-trip induced fund-raiser to ask for money to pay for hosting, allow me to attend various cartooning events and provide goodwill support for my time running the blog. This year, because my investment of time and efforts will be so much bigger, I’m using Indiegogo to raise more money than I’ve ever raised before and I’ve reached out to several friends of the blog to help provide exciting incentives for all the donors. </p>

At the end of this process (I’m shooting for end of January) The Daily Cartoonist will have more news, be better focused, better sourced and look fantastic on your mobile phone or tablet at 2:00 am (or any other time, really). 
The Rewards
So each year (okay, mostly every year), I run a NPR-style guilt-trip induced fund-raiser to ask for money to pay for hosting, allow me to attend various cartooning events and provide goodwill support for my time running the blog. This year, because my investment of time and efforts will be so much bigger, I’m using Indiegogo to raise more money than I’ve ever raised before and I’ve reached out to several friends of the blog to help provide exciting incentives for all the donors.

WHAT IS A META-DIMENSIONAL COMIC BOOK?“A Story of Light: Polaris” is a comic book that speaks about real people that we may meet in the street or – in this case – in a gym. These people however, live in a world very similar to ours, where some elements are new and mysterious. A world where we will find aliens, monsters, incredible technology and superhuman threats that can only be faced with a legendary weapon... In this world we will also find friendship, value, courage, compassion and so much adventure.“A Story of Light: Polaris” is a meta-dimensional comic as it allows you to know (and recognise) the protagonists and places where Light Saber Combat is fought in the real world.THE STORYJake is a young man who loves music, his friends, his Vespa and his favourite sport. In the gym he goes to in Milan, he will discover something that he would never have imagined: his Masters are not who he thought they were, and more importantly, the weapon he uses for light saber combat can actually be activated, turning into a lethal weapon. Which of his course mates knows the secret of Polaris? But above all, what do the Masters and their most loyal followers have in mind? Together with his friends, Jake will go on a journey to discover the truth, meeting adversaries and allies, and will discover that it is not always easy to know the difference between them.THE FIRST SEASON’S HEROESSABNAK AND NEMOFounder Masters of LudoSport, Jake’s first Masters, but above all the keepers of a big secret and an uncomfortable truth.POLJake’s best friend, his companion in adventures right from childhood. He is impulsive and generous, and never spares himself.J.P.American, a former soldier from the special forces. He is an old, expert warrior. His advice and his arm are firmly in the service of justice.NOGRAEducated by the Masters in the secrets and construction of the Polaris sabers, he is essential to clearing the mist and hidden plots. He is an opponent that shouldn’t be underestimated in combat.RYOLegendary warrior, good friend and blade brother of Rock, will he enter the field to spread light over the incumbent darkness?LORKLegendary warrior, fearless and sarcastic, with exceptional, overwhelming technique. He secretly collaborates with HUGO.HUGOA true support to the Masters, we will discover his wisdom and hidden talents and – thanks to his calculating mind – his way of always being one step in front of the others. YOU CAN BE A PROTAGONIST TOO!Reality becomes fiction. The first season of ""A Story of Light: Polaris"" has some of Ludosport’s most well-known athletes plus the winners of the LudoSport 2016 LightSaber Combat World Championship as its protagonists. The winners of the 2017 edition will be present as characters in season two, and so on in future years. However, the adventure does not finish here: the protagonists will travel in the various LudoSport gyms around the world and anyone who is a pupil could recognise their own instructor or even themselves at a lesson in a storyboard. Meta-dimensionality has no geographical boundaries. THE PROJECTSeries: A Story of LightComic Book: PolarisSeason: 1#1 issue of 6: ""The truth about the sword""Format: comic bookPages: 22+4Languages: Italian, American English THE AUTHORSGiovanni Gualdoni, Valeria Favoccia, Daniele Rudoni, Simone Spreafico and Gianluca Longo. ORIGINAL PROJECTGianluca Longo, Simone SpreaficoThe LudoSport Founder Masters developed the heart of a story years ago when the real and imaginary planes merge, where real people could move from one plane to the other via sports competition.SHOWRUNNER, SCRIPT AND SCREENPLAYGiovanni GualdoniOne of the leading comic authors in Italy, Giovanni has worked for years at Sergio Bonelli Editore where he developed stories for Dylan Dog, Martin Mystère and many others.

Their careful, vivid touch further embellishes each storyboard of “A Story of Light: Polaris”.THE COMIC WITHIN THE COMIC“A Story of Light: Polaris” contains a “special feature”: each issue hosts a single lightsaber combat technique developed by the LudoSport Masters and practised within the network. A special illustrated insert by the artist Anna Diaz will describe the technique in detail to satisfy the curiosity of even the most careful. THE GOALS OF THE CAMPAIGNAt the first goal we will be able to realise the first issue of Season 1 in Italian (printed) and in the English translation version (PDF).Achieving Stretch Goal 1 will allow us to realise the first issue of Season 1 in printed version, also for the English translation.Achieving Stretch Goal 2 will allow us to realise the entire Season 1 in printed version, in Italian and in English.THE TYPES OF PERKThe [ITALIANS] perks are dedicated to Italian supporters, who can also access all the other categories, anyway.The [WORLD] perks are dedicated to everyone, and guarantee access to the personalised stretch goals, where indicated.At STRETCH GOAL 1: + the first issue in English (printed copy)+ a flash drive with more digital bonus materialsAt STRETCH GOAL 2: + the second printed issue in English or Italian (language chosen by the backer)+ the official poster signed by all the authors (numbered copy)The perk [COLLECTORS] are dedicated to fans of the genre, and guarantee access to the personalised stretch goals where indicated.At STRETCH GOAL 1: + the first issue in English (printed copy) with a special variant cover+ printed ghost table (post credits issue one, included in first issue+ a flash drive with more digital bonus materialsAt STRETCH GOAL 2: + the second printed issue in English or Italian (to be decided by the backer)+ ghost table (post credits issue one) printed and bound in the first issue+ a special table signed by all the authors (numbered copy)The [LANGUAGE] perks are dedicated to French, Spanish and German language supporters.On reaching 70 perks for each language, we will be able to translate the first issue and deliver it in PDF.ITALIAN VERSIONCOS’È UN FUMETTO METADIMENSIONALE?“A Story of Light: Polaris” è un fumetto che parla di persone vere, reali, che si possono incontrare per strada o – in questo caso – in una palestra. Queste persone però, vivono in un mondo molto simile al nostro, in cui alcuni elementi sono nuovi e misteriosi. Un mondo in cui troveremo alieni, mostri, tecnologie incredibili e minacce sovrumane che si potranno affrontare solo con un’arma leggendaria… In questo mondo troveremo anche amicizia, valore, coraggio, compassione e tantissima avventura. “A Story of Light: Polaris” è un fumetto metadimensionale perché permette di conoscere (e riconoscere) nel mondo reale i protagonisti e i luoghi in cui viene praticato il Light Saber Combat sportivo.LA STORIAJake è un giovane che ama la musica, gli amici, la sua Vespa e il suo sport preferito. Proprio nella palestra che frequenta a Milano, scoprirà qualcosa che non avrebbe mai immaginato: i suoi Maestri non sono chi credeva che fossero, e soprattutto l'arma che utilizza per praticare il light saber combat può essere realmente attivata tramutandosi in uno strumento letale. Chi tra i suoi compagni di corso conosce il segreto di Polaris? Ma soprattutto cosa hanno in mente i Maestri e i loro seguaci più fidati? Assieme ai suoi amici, Jake viaggerà alla scoperta della verità incontrando avversari e alleati, e scoprirà che non sempre è facile distinguerli.GLI EROI DELLA PRIMA STAGIONESABNAK E NEMOMaestri Fondatori di LudoSport, Primi Maestri di Jake, ma soprattutto portatori di un grande segreto e di una altrettanto scomoda verità.POLIl migliore amico di Jake, compagno di avventure fin dall’infanzia.

I vincitori dell'edizione 2017 saranno presenti come personaggi all'interno della seconda stagione, e così negli anni successivi. Ma l'avventura non finisce qui: i protagonisti viaggeranno nelle diverse palestre LudoSport in giro per il mondo, e chiunque sia un allievo potrebbe riconoscere in una tavola il proprio Istruttore o perfino sé stesso durante una lezione.

SYNTH/org è un’antologia di fumetti fantascientifica che ruota intorno al tema della vita sintetica, dell’intelligenza artificiale, degli androidi in ogni declinazione: insomma, i protagonisti questa volta sono i robot!
Il volume, che costituirà la pubblicazione principale di Attaccapanni Press per il 2019, riunirà 16 artisti italiani e conterà quasi 200 pagine completamente a colori in formato 16x23 cm, rilegato in brossura fresata; per la prima volta sperimenteremo la stampa in offset, per regalarvi una qualità ancora migliore.
L’obbiettivo è, come per le antologie passate, di darci appuntamento a Lucca Comics & Games 2019.
Contiamo sul vostro sostegno per poter realizzare anche quest’anno una raccolta di storie emozionanti, atipiche e indimenticabili!

Attaccapanni Press è un'etichetta di micro-editoria fondata nel 2017 dopo il successo di Grimorio. Ariel Vittori e Laura Guglielmo si sono così divertite a curare ed editare quel libro da volerne fare molti altri: Melagrana, Ave, Grimorio II e ora SYNTH/org.
All'interno le 13 storie sono firmate da autori tra i migliori del panorama editoriale tradizionale e indipendente, tra punte di diamante già conosciute e fantastici esordienti che vi stupiranno, riuniti sotto una cover d'eccezione di LRNZ, al secolo Lorenzo Ceccotti. Farà da introduzione alle storie una prefazione di Adrian Fartade!

Potete già vedere anteprime del loro lavoro nel video, nella gallery e sulle nostre pagine social durante il periodo della campagna!


I pacchetti di quest'anno vanno dal Bit all'Exabyte, preziosissimi dati di cui vi sveliamo qui il contenuto in maniera più approfondita.

L'ebook di SYNTH/org: un file PDF con dentro tutte le storie dell'antologia. Solo nel perk Bit.

Il volume di SYNTH/org! Da ritirare a Lucca o da ricevere a casa, la copia fisica dell'antologia. Dal perk Byte in su.
 
Cover di Leonardo Mazzoli.
L'esclusivo artbook digitale di SYNTH/org: schizzi preparatori, work in progress, varianti di personaggi e definitivi. Presente in tutti i perk da Kilobyte in su.

Un bellissimo sticker 50x70 mm a sfondo trasparente, firmato da Eleonora Bruni esclusivamente per il nostro crowdfunding! Presente in tutti i perk da Kilobyte in su.

Il segnalibro con un'immagine esplosiva dalla storia di Luca Claretti per l'antologia, stampato su speciale carta perlata. Dal perk Kilobyte in su.

Una bellissima enamel pin da collezione, con design di Laura Guglielmo, la nostra amichevole grafica di quartiere. Per esporre con orgoglio il vostro amore per la robotica! Solo dal perk Megabyte in su.

*design temporaneo, non definitivo
Una strepitosa maglietta in stampa serigrafica con un esclusivo design di Walter Baiamonte. SOLO nel perk Terabyte.
 

*copertina di Impronte temporanea, non definitiva
Nel perk Gigabyte troverete invece solo libri, nello specifico: tutti i libri di Attaccapanni Press previsti per il 2019! Oltre a SYNTH/org ci saranno quindi:
Iconoclast di Walter Baiamonte, spillato, 52 pagine. La dinamica sfida a colpi di flash di un mostro sacro della fotografia e di un talento emergente che ne stravolge le regole. Chi sarà consacrato come artista, e chi invece sarà dimenticato?
Clessidra n°2 con storie di Ariel Vittori, Genny Ferrari, Chiara Raimondi e Yi Yang, spillato, 62 pagine. Il secondo numero del nostro annuale sul tempo torna con 4 storie di 12 pagine, stavolta sui quarti di giornata: alba, mezzogiorno, tramonto e mezzanotte.
Impronte di Stefano Martinuz, brossurato, 80+ pagine. Un racconto di formazione riccamente illustrato, il viaggio di un protagonista rimasto senza casa che si trova a incontrare ogni genere di creatura, luogo e pericolo - fino a trovare, forse, una nuova famiglia. [in uscita in Autunno]
Immagine di esempio di Francesco Guarnaccia.
Nei rarissimi pacchetti Exabyte potete trovare, oltre al contenuto del perk Megabyte, una commission per ognuno dei seguenti artisti presenti nel libro: Albhey Longo, Arianna Climaci, Francesco Guarnaccia, Enrica Leone, Laura Guglielmo, Zeno Colangelo. Non perdete l'occasione di avere un originale di uno di loro!

Un libro amico del codice binario non potrà che avere una tiratura di 1000 copie! Per coprirne la realizzazione utilizzeremo circa il 50% dei fondi. Quest'anno la base richiesta è più alta per via del passaggio dalla stampa digitale alla stampa offset, tramite i servizi della tipografia veneta Printsoon.
Il resto verrà ripartito tra la produzione degli altri perk (15%), spese di spedizione e packaging (15%), tasse e oneri vari di Indiegogo (10%), marketing e promozione (5%) e alle spese amministrative di Attaccapanni Press come associazione culturale per il 2019 (5%).
 E in caso riuscissimo a superare le aspettative, abbiamo previsto degli allettanti stretch goal per voi!


A €8300 arricchiremo la splendida copertina di LRNZ con una finitura dorata, rendendola ancora più preziosa.
 
E dopo? Abbiamo una sorpresa speciale per lo stretch goal di €10.000, ma dovrete aspettare di avvicinarvi un po' di più prima di saperlo!


Questa sarà la quinta campagna crowdfunding di Attaccapanni.
Per tutte quelle precedenti il goal è stato raggiunto e il libro è stato consegnato in tempo: tutti gli imprevisti di spedizione o tipografici superati con successo. Siamo pronte anche questa volta ad affrontare ogni sfida per portarvi il prodotto migliore possibile!
I nostri artisti sono già al lavoro da molto, e il libro verrà stampato in estate. L'unico vero rischio è non raggiungere il goal: e per quello, servite voi!


Sia che possiate supportare la campagna direttamente o meno, condividetela! Parlatene con amici, cugini, nella fumetteria sotto casa, al lavoro.
E, soprattutto, sui social! Usate gli strumenti di condivisione di Indiegogo per far arrivare la campagna oltre l'orizzonte degli eventi, al di là del tempo e dello spazio. Così che da questa scintilla il circuito si attivi, e la vita sintetica possa nascere.

<h3>Copper Coins</h3>
<p>Co-creators Charles Denton and Lars Kommienezuspadt exhume the genre of Midcentury horror. Copper Coins is an anthology of chilling tales of psychological hauntings, exploring the grim depths of the human experience.</p>
<p>Writer, Charles Denton of <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/help-launch-blue-flame-extinguish-pre-order-your-copy-today/x/536487#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Blue Flame</a> and Lars Kommienezuspadt, creator of THEIA and The Spoils, finally collaborate on this homage to the era of classic EC Comics titles like Tales From the Crypt, The Vault of Horrors and Weird Fantasy.</p>
<p>An allegory of suffering, loss and madness told by Charon, the Ferryman of The River Styx [...our ode to The Crypt Keeper], while traversing souls to the realm of the dead. </p>
<p>Passchendaele, our first story and the catalyst for our crowdfunding efforts, tells the story of the forgotten nightmare of WWI. While Verdun and The Somme claim the historic relevance, those who died in The Battle of Passchendaele endured unfathomable horrors, swallowed by the earth.</p>
<p>Otto, a German infantry man, imprisoned in mud at the bottom of an artillery hole, impulsively shoots Ira, an Australian solider. As Ira's corpse plummets to the cold November waters, Otto's guilt and increasing madness consume him. The unforgiving rain of Ypres slowly condemns Otto to the same inevitable fate of his fallen company as both men contemplate life, death and the troubled nature of human existence.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>Sustainability of the Horror Genre</h3>
<p>Copper Coins is for those who remember reading black and white tales of horror like Eerie and Creepy. Our hope is to revitalize and honor that era; to stand on the tombstones of the legendary artists and writers that established the genre some 70 years ago. </p>
<p>For over a year, Charles and Lars have met weekly to develop Copper Coins, Passchendaele and several stories on deck waiting to cross the River Styx to the page. Your contribution and support provides the creators an opportunity to focus solely on the anthology. The ability to manifest the many concepts and world of Copper Coins to the page, without the constant interruptions of other work, most of which is unrelated to the title.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>This Is Personal</h3>
<p>As loyalists of horror, whether it's novels, comics or film,  avid consumers of all interpretations of the genre. As creators, every time we break a story, we're trying connect with the inherent fears and dread of the human experience.</p>
<p>Weekly, we meet at our darkened cafe, enduring the Minnesota winter, while building the worlds and characters of Copper Coins over hot cups of black coffee.</p>

</div></div>","Copper Coins
Co-creators Charles Denton and Lars Kommienezuspadt exhume the genre of Midcentury horror. Copper Coins is an anthology of chilling tales of psychological hauntings, exploring the grim depths of the human experience.
Writer, Charles Denton of Blue Flame and Lars Kommienezuspadt, creator of THEIA and The Spoils, finally collaborate on this homage to the era of classic EC Comics titles like Tales From the Crypt, The Vault of Horrors and Weird Fantasy.
An allegory of suffering, loss and madness told by Charon, the Ferryman of The River Styx [...our ode to The Crypt Keeper], while traversing souls to the realm of the dead. 
Passchendaele, our first story and the catalyst for our crowdfunding efforts, tells the story of the forgotten nightmare of WWI. While Verdun and The Somme claim the historic relevance, those who died in The Battle of Passchendaele endured unfathomable horrors, swallowed by the earth.
Otto, a German infantry man, imprisoned in mud at the bottom of an artillery hole, impulsively shoots Ira, an Australian solider. As Ira's corpse plummets to the cold November waters, Otto's guilt and increasing madness consume him. The unforgiving rain of Ypres slowly condemns Otto to the same inevitable fate of his fallen company as both men contemplate life, death and the troubled nature of human existence.


Sustainability of the Horror Genre
Copper Coins is for those who remember reading black and white tales of horror like Eerie and Creepy. Our hope is to revitalize and honor that era; to stand on the tombstones of the legendary artists and writers that established the genre some 70 years ago. 
For over a year, Charles and Lars have met weekly to develop Copper Coins, Passchendaele and several stories on deck waiting to cross the River Styx to the page. Your contribution and support provides the creators an opportunity to focus solely on the anthology. The ability to manifest the many concepts and world of Copper Coins to the page, without the constant interruptions of other work, most of which is unrelated to the title.

This Is Personal
As loyalists of horror, whether it's novels, comics or film,  avid consumers of all interpretations of the genre. As creators, every time we break a story, we're trying connect with the inherent fears and dread of the human experience.
Weekly, we meet at our darkened cafe, enduring the Minnesota winter, while building the worlds and characters of Copper Coins over hot cups of black coffee.

<p>Hi, fans, followers, and newcomers!</p>
<p>I want to thank everyone including the hardcore fans, the team, the Eisner committee, and Line Webtoons for supporting me on my adventure bringing you all my book, Brothers Bond. Over 4 years ago, I came up with this story and it has been a mind-blowing journey since. Kevin was an amazing addition to make it even better. The Brothers Bond story is about the journey of the haves and have-nots, told through the eyes of a young man going through the coming of age period we all eventually go through at some point in our lives. With a spin of adventure and comedy, the main character Yoshi is on a mission with his two blind samurai protectors to fix his past mistakes and restore the land to what his people and ancestors once cherished. Of Course, any adventure with two blind samurais is always super cool! When I started this series, it was originally meant to be in print. Now I am bringing it to you as it was originally meant to be in full color and spectacular splash pages. This adventure is only beginning. Welcome to the world of Brothers Bond.</p>

<h3>It's a Kimchi Cuddles Book!</h3> <p></p>
<p><span>Hi, I'm <span>Tikva Wolf!  Two years ago, I created <a href=""http://kimchicuddles.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kimchi Cuddles</a>, a webcomic </span>that explores alternative relationships in a variety of different ways.  Kimchi spreads awareness about poly, queer and genderqueer issues in a way that's both funny and touching. </span>The comic took off at a rapid pace, and I get emails every day from people sharing how much the comic has helped them or inspired them to be more authentic and loving in their own relationships. I feel incredibly happy about having touched so many lives. But I want to do more.</p>
<p>This book will be a compilation of the “best of Kimchi Cuddles,” arranged by topic to create an inspirational guide for navigating alternative relationships and explaining them to others. You can help bring this incredible book into existence by contributing to this campaign, AND you’ll get awesome prizes for doing so!  Check out the reward details below, donate whatever you can, and spread the word to everyone you know! Let’s make a Kimchi Cuddles book!</p>

After undergoing many different artistic incarnations, I realized that what I primarily care about in art (and life) is connecting to people, creating dialogue and spreading awareness.  I've always taken delight in making people laugh, and in doing so also unveiling hidden perspectives.  Comedy has the ability to transform heavy topics into something that’s easier to digest.  I use humor as a way of being seen deeply, and as a way of encouraging others to deeply see themselves and each other.</span></p>

I'm working with Thorntree Press: a new, independent publishing company based in Portland, Oregon. They specialize in non-fiction books on relationships, love and sexuality, with particular focus on non-traditional relationship models. They're also focused on rational, evidence-based approaches to sex and relationships, as well as sharing real-life stories.

</div></div>","Update: STRETCH GOALS!
We've met our goal AND our first stretch goal, and we're working on our second stretch goal: If we raise $16,000, we'll make a poster of this comic and ship it out to backers at $75 and above (others will get a chance to buy it!): 





Also the price of our ""relationship consultation"" and ""relationship counseling"" perks has just been dropped to $500!

It's a Kimchi Cuddles Book! 
Hi, I'm Tikva Wolf!  Two years ago, I created Kimchi Cuddles, a webcomic that explores alternative relationships in a variety of different ways.  Kimchi spreads awareness about poly, queer and genderqueer issues in a way that's both funny and touching. The comic took off at a rapid pace, and I get emails every day from people sharing how much the comic has helped them or inspired them to be more authentic and loving in their own relationships. I feel incredibly happy about having touched so many lives. But I want to do more.
This book will be a compilation of the “best of Kimchi Cuddles,” arranged by topic to create an inspirational guide for navigating alternative relationships and explaining them to others. You can help bring this incredible book into existence by contributing to this campaign, AND you’ll get awesome prizes for doing so!  Check out the reward details below, donate whatever you can, and spread the word to everyone you know! Let’s make a Kimchi Cuddles book!

Who am I?



I've been drawing ever since I could hold a crayon. After undergoing many different artistic incarnations, I realized that what I primarily care about in art (and life) is connecting to people, creating dialogue and spreading awareness.  I've always taken delight in making people laugh, and in doing so also unveiling hidden perspectives.  Comedy has the ability to transform heavy topics into something that’s easier to digest.  I use humor as a way of being seen deeply, and as a way of encouraging others to deeply see themselves and each other.


The book will also have a foreword from the amazing Sophie Labelle, creator of the webcomic Assigned Male!






I'm working with Thorntree Press: a new, independent publishing company based in Portland, Oregon. They specialize in non-fiction books on relationships, love and sexuality, with particular focus on non-traditional relationship models. They're also focused on rational, evidence-based approaches to sex and relationships, as well as sharing real-life stories. They're the publishers of More Than Two by Franklin Veaux and Eve Rickert, The Husband Swap by Louisa Leontiades, The Game Changer by Franklin Veaux, Stories From the Polycule by Elisabeth Sheff, and Lessons in Love and Life to My Younger Self, written by Louisa Leontiades and illustrated by me!
Thorntree Press uses crowdfunding to fund production and marketing for all of its books, so they can maintain high production standards, take bigger risks on their titles, and give creators a bigger share of royalties. They've already completed two successful crowdfunding campaigns, for More Than Two and their 2015 season, with hundreds of happy backers!
The money raised in this campaign will go toward editing, layout, proofreading and production and marketing costs.


The Rewards
If you support me, you can get my book, as well as a bunch of other cool Kimchi Cuddles stuff—including original artwork from the series! At higher backer levels, you can also get a sneak peek at the book before it's published.
I'm also excited to be able to offer print and e-books of all the other Thorntree Press titles, and a bunch of other things from other poly and poly-friendly folks. Check out what you can get!
International backers: We will ship to backers outside the USA, but we'll be asking you for a little extra to help out with costs. Thorntree Press is handling fulfilment and will be in touch with you after the campaign to request a small additional amount based on your location and perk.

Kimchi book & other goodies


Of course, you can get the Kimchi Cuddles book in both paperback and e-book. And everyone who backs the campaign will get digital access to an exclusive secret Kimchi Cuddles comic, plus a personal thank-you on the Kimchi Cuddles Facebook page.

It fits the spooky storytelling by adding shadow to hide monsters, and the detail in the backgrounds make you want to spend time on each panel.” “The monsters are very Lovecraftian. … Because they have that Lovecraftian feel to them, the monsters really are both written and drawn in a way that affected my Lizard Brain.” Read the full reviewThe Pullbox called it “the bastard lovechild of John Hughes & H.P. Lovecraft.” (We’re pretty sure they meant that in a metaphorical way, because if that’s literal, well… ewww.) Here’s more from Paul’s review: “It brings a mismatched group of high schoolers together, throwing them against evil the likes of which you’d find in a dusty tome full of impossible to pronounce names. The beauty is in the execution. Despite some pretty heavy themes -- mounting madness, eternal torment, human sacrifice -- Mike Shea’s story stays fairly tongue in cheek. [Artist Ryan Mendoza] knows how to get his Lovecraft on. So many tentacles…” Read the full reviewItemsBefore you back Miskatonic High, check out some of the items we have to offer. We offer shipping to anywhere in the world, but shipping costs are separate from the costs.  Of course. Here’s the first few pages of Miskatonic High #1 so you can see if you like it.Stick with us as through the six-issue first season, Alex, Matt, Sarah, Simon and Ren will travel through time to come face to face with Abdul Alhazred and his Necronomicon, descend into the darkest pits under the earth, and learn what is really going on in the public library when no one is looking.So please join us for the fun!We’re raising funds to pay for a small print run for our Indiegogo backers and the old one lurking down in the basement. But comics are expensive to make. Printers, the Postal Service and shipping supplies will be taking most of what we raise. Indiegogo takes their percentage, as does payment processing. If anything is left over, we might go nuts on McDonald’s Dollar Menu!Is that an existential question, because we haven’t gotten that far in AP English Lit yet. Yes, there are two guys working hard to bring Miskatonic High to life. The comic was written and lettered by Mike Shea and drawn and colored by Ryan Mendoza. We’d say more about ourselves, but we’re actually really busy putting the finishing touches on issue 8! So you can feel comfortable getting invested in Miskatonic High, because you’re sure to find out the answers to what is really going on!Additionally, you can follow Miskatonic High on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Plus there's a Miskatonic High website where you can sign up to our mailing list for the latest updates.Haven't I seen you before?We did a successful campaign on Kickstarter but have heard that Indiegogo has its own indie comics community and wanted to see if we could find any supporters over here. Consider this a trial for us to settle the whole Indiegogo vs. Kickstarter thing.Attribution""Hey guys, who did that amazing music in your video?"" Glad you asked, it's a track called Wizard by Jahzzar, which is available on the Free Music Archive. We edited the track to fit our video.The cover and pages for the issue are completed and are just waiting to go to print. We have quotes from several printers which specialize in on-demand comic printing and fulfillment. The pages will be sent in late-May and the issues take approximately two weeks to print. It will take another week or so for all of the items to ship. You should receive the items around the end of June, but we'll keep you updated on the schedule as we find out.So, really, the biggest risk is an aquatic monster dismembering you and dragging you down your drainpipe. But don’t worry, we know the number for a really good reanimator.",24.0,0,"2 Campaigns

From the bowels of a massive Pacific Ocean garbage island, THE SQUID, while in a decades long coma, is cast out of his trash cocoon by the tsunami of 2011 and set adrift toward the Japanese shoreline. He's eventually plucked out of the sea by a ship that happens by where, over a day, he becomes conscious and jumps overboard-narrowly escaping becoming the possession of a wealthy man bent on putting him in a fish tank. After arriving on land and hooking up with a group of kids headed to a mall, he starts to piece together his past and is pursued by the dangerous forces of his future. 




THE SQUID 3 expands this world as he is unwittingly hunted down by a hi-tech paramilitary unit launched by someone introduced in previous issues, an individual with grave reasons for his elimination while unseen incidents place powerful weapons in the hands of the unprepared. The book is an ongoing series which I've mapped out over several issues and the current story arc should come to a blistering (or at least slightly chaffed) close in THE SQUID 5. The story so far has brought us to coastal and central Japan, New Guinea, and into the future somewhere in subsaharan Africa. My generous supporters have already helped me get THE SQUID 1 printed and I went on to use my own funds to self publish THE SQUID 2. This third issue will of course be made but it would help greatly to get some support for this third issue so I can use the funding to print books and create a few promotional items to get the word out about this story. I didn't have the resources to accomplish that for issue two and I would love to give THE SQUID 3 the big boost it deserves. 

You may be wondering why I want to print books instead of putting them on a print per purchase comics site. You're saying: 'hey Earl, that's stupid, why would you waste your precious time and resources printing books without the guarantee of a sale and why the hell are you asking me for help? Don't you know I'm on a fixed income?' The answer to the first part of that question is that I'm a very small potato in terms of the comics world right now. If I were to sell my books in that manner I would be quickly tucked away into a digital backwater to be found only by the occasional person who is already familiar with my work. That stinks for me! Your generous contribution to my project would translate into me being able to print my book but it would also allow me to promote my comic through stickers, business cards and trade shows. To answer the second part of the question I guess I could say simply that I'm asking for your help to assist me in growing. I'm not a name, you people are my audience right now. It's so much fun to share these stories with you and your enthusiasm fuels my desire to keep creating. Your support will mean a lot to what I can produce, the evolution of my skills and the ability to keep going with the characters I've constructed. In the long run, It may also be the gateway in which I can pass from a person selling my hours to selling my skills...Boy, that would  be something, wouldn't it?  






Cold Facts
Aside from some proof reading and advice from my circle of friends, I'm pretty much a one man show. I write the story, design the characters, lay the pages out, pencil the pages, ink them, letter them, edit the final work, create supplementary art for the comic, create and color the covers, fashion promotional material, build an online presence, construct a fundraiser, work on the next issue, practice drawing, work a 9am-5pm job and attempt to have some sort of a life outside of working all the time so I have some ideas to pour back into the stories. I'm not complaining, just saying it's a shit ton of work and your financial assistance would mean very much to me. It would translate into me being able to put the book out much faster than I would be able to do by myself and help me afford some of the most basic forms of self promotion available. Since it's all me, you would truly be a patron of a singular artist if you participated in funding me. Not to toot my own horn but the work keeps getting better issue by issue. 


Risks
All of the artwork for THE SQUID 3 has been completed and is standing by for printing so the risk of not receiving your comics and stickers is, for the most part, non existent. If I don't reach my goal it should be understood that my ability to ship your products anywhere near a timely fashion will be seriously affected.  


Other ways you can help
If you're not into comics but know someone who is, please help me get the word out by sharing my link-tell your family and friends about the project. There are tools on this website that you can use to help me spread the word.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Eight years ago my cousin Jesse Davidge and I embarked on a creative journey together.  I had written scripts for a series of comic stories about seven mathematicians from various eras in history who are mysteriously banded together to take on problems of a grand and metaphysical nature.  Jesse, who had only recently become an animator, began working on the tales of the Wandering Stars in his spare time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In 2010 we were excited to have our work released as a 100 page graphic novel by Bayeux Arts as part of their new imprint, Rosencrantz Comics.  Mathemagick &amp; Mystiphysics Volume One: The Probabilities of Pandemonium by the Davidge Cousins has been well-received by various audiences ranging from elementary students to university professors to comic book fans. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Last summer I completed the manuscript for Mathemagick &amp; Mystiphysics Volume Two: Apples and Origins.  It goes more indepth into the characters' true histories while also further developing the cartoon cosmology we are creating.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Jesse, who now is co-owner of a small animation studio, is understandably not in a positon at this stage in his life to work on Mathemagick without compensation.  This project budget would provide him $50 per page which is still far below industry standards.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Completion of this graphic novel would bring a work of artistry and literature into the world that is intelligently entertaining and distinctly educational.  If Jesse is unable to complete the illustrations in a timely manner we will potentially lose out on publishing opportunities that have been gained by the momentum of the first volume.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>All proceeds from this fundraising initiative will go to Jesse to complete the illustrations from the already completed script. Any extra money earned will go to the inevitable final production expenses.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Nineteen years ago, Milo ""Daws"" Dawson moved away from home to go to college and come out. After graduating, he chose closeted, corporate life instead of a U-haul back to his hometown with his college boyfriend and high school friend...until his job was outsourced fifteen years later. Now, 37 years old and broke, he's moved back home, to rent a room in his ex's house, and to find himself all over again. He's in a boarding house run by his ex-boyfriend, Thomas Mulligan, shared by three other boarders, all trying to repair their own lives. As Daws tries piecing his own life together in his old hometown, he graples with the possibilities of his own second chances.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Media costs money: sketchbooks, coffee, inking stuff, pen nibs, coffee, licenses for graphics programs (sorry Sai-crackers, not cool), more coffee, domain registration, webhosting on a site where I've got some independence, still more coffee, maybe a downpayment on a laptop I can use to publish/produce strips somewhere other than my room, and more coffee. So here's what I'm offering up for incentives:</p>
<p>$25: A mention of thanks and gratitude on the website</p>
<p>$50: Background cameo in a stip</p>
<p>$100: Featured cameo in a single-installment (8-10 panels)</p>
<p>$250: Buy your way into the cast as a semi-recurring, biographied, supporting character. You'll get to suggest a single subplot (7-8 installments) per year and shape the scripts for it. And who knows, your character may pop up elsewhere?</p>
<p>$500: The Full Monty. Ten full-color pictures of your favorite character(s) doing anything legal in post ""Lawrence vs Texas"" America.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I'm just a queer Gen-X'er with body image issues who never really saw himself reflected in the gay comics out there. They were either too campy, too twinky, too quirky, too oversexed, or too circuit-driven. I just want to tell a little slice-of-life narrative, splashed in with the occasional editorial commentary, with characters I'd actually want to hang out with...and hope that a few people might appreciate the journey.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Alex Nall. I'm a cartoonist and teaching artist living in Chicago, Il. I have been self-publishing comics since 2011 and have been teaching since 2013. Last year, with the help of Indiegogo, I successfully funded the publication of my first book <i>Teaching Comics: Volume One</i>. This campaign is being created to help raise funds for the publication of a new comic, <i>Let Some Word That Is Heard Be Yours</i>. The comic is an overview of Fred Rogers' life and how he came to be  the man behind the influential children's television program 'Mister Roger's Neighborhood'. While there have been many books written about the success of 'Mister Rogers' Neighborhood', very few highlight Rogers' biography and moments in his life that led up to him creating one of the most beloved children's television program in history. <i>LSWTIHBY</i> showcases scenes from Rogers' childhood and teenage years, up to the turning point in 1968 when he created 'Mister Rogers' Neighborhood' for PBS. The book also continues to show scenes of my life as an early-educator and how the lessons Mister Rogers' taught over thirty years ago are still relevant in and out of the the classroom today.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>I'm trying to raise $2000 to fund the publication of 500 copies of <i>LSWTIHBY</i>. The book is 50 pages and will be printed in color, which drives up the printing costs.</li>
<li>By supporting the campaign you'll be able to pre-order a copy of the comic, have access to previously published comics and minis, as well as the opportunity to have an original ink drawing of Mister Rogers for your collection!</li>
<li>Any funds that are raised will be used for the publication of the comic book.  I'm hoping to have this book ready by mid-May/beginning of June. A significant portion of the book is already done (pencilled, inked, colored) and I'll be posting new pages here for campaign supporters to see.</li>

</div><p>Thanks for reading! </p><p>Alex</p></div>","Short Summary
My name is Alex Nall. I'm a cartoonist and teaching artist living in Chicago, Il. I have been self-publishing comics since 2011 and have been teaching since 2013. Last year, with the help of Indiegogo, I successfully funded the publication of my first book Teaching Comics: Volume One. This campaign is being created to help raise funds for the publication of a new comic, Let Some Word That Is Heard Be Yours. The comic is an overview of Fred Rogers' life and how he came to be  the man behind the influential children's television program 'Mister Roger's Neighborhood'. While there have been many books written about the success of 'Mister Rogers' Neighborhood', very few highlight Rogers' biography and moments in his life that led up to him creating one of the most beloved children's television program in history. LSWTIHBY showcases scenes from Rogers' childhood and teenage years, up to the turning point in 1968 when he created 'Mister Rogers' Neighborhood' for PBS. The book also continues to show scenes of my life as an early-educator and how the lessons Mister Rogers' taught over thirty years ago are still relevant in and out of the the classroom today.


What I Need & What You Get

I'm trying to raise $2000 to fund the publication of 500 copies of LSWTIHBY. The book is 50 pages and will be printed in color, which drives up the printing costs.
By supporting the campaign you'll be able to pre-order a copy of the comic, have access to previously published comics and minis, as well as the opportunity to have an original ink drawing of Mister Rogers for your collection!
Any funds that are raised will be used for the publication of the comic book.  I'm hoping to have this book ready by mid-May/beginning of June. A significant portion of the book is already done (pencilled, inked, colored) and I'll be posting new pages here for campaign supporters to see.



The Impact

I used Indiegogo last year to successfully publish my first book Teaching Comics: Volume One. I had a great time coming up with a campaign and perks for supporters to follow and was met with plenty of enthusiasm from campaign supporters. I'm hoping to do the same here for people who have enjoyed my comics and have an interest in Mister Rogers' life.
As a self-publisher I'm free to create whatever content I want to and share it online, but my goal is to have a printed book that I can sell/give away at small press conventions. The money it costs to print such a book is hard to fund on my own, so anything helps!



Other Ways You Can Help
I completely understand if you can't contribute a financial donation. You can also help by spreading the link for this campaign on social media and sharing it with a friend or family member that has fond memories of watching Mister Rogers.

<h2>The Project</h2>
<p>The Grimlock series follows a young adult named Brandon Grout (a descendent of a magical bloodline) who, as a child, was abandoned by his parents and sent to an abusive foster home located in a place called ScarCity. Later as a teen, Brandon is bullied and ridiculed. Resenting society and life in general, Brandon drops out of high school, gets involved with the criminal underworld, and becomes a street racer. Brandon develops into an egotistical, rebellious, independent character who is a master at street racing, having everything he ever wanted and more - money, power, cars. During one fateful race, Brandon’s racing career screeches to a staggering halt when he is possessed by a spirit called the “Galaxo” and crashes. Waking up to find himself in the hospital perfectly ok after a violent, car crash that should have taken his life, things start to get weird for Brandon. It is here where he discovers his new abilities. Throughout the series, Brandon discovers more about his powers, where the mysterious spirit came from, and most importantly, what really happened to his parents.</p>

<p>In this comic, we uncover a universe ridden with dark alleys and secrets. Given this comic deals with the occult realm, we will focus on showcasing some of the dark arts, creating a realistic view of the unknown from a realistic perspective and showcasing the intensity of the supernatural.</p>
<p>All in all, our goal is to open up on a seemingly normal human being with normal problems and a relatively normal life and transition that into a fast paced, supernatural rollercoaster filled with unexpected twists and turns. We follow this character through the series, watching him grow and evolve over time, as he discovers more and more about the truth of his past and how it’s intertwined with his present and future.</p>

<p><i><strong>What is MAXIMUM WIDOW EXHIBITION?</strong></i></p>
<p>  MAXIMUM WIDOW EXHIBITION is a new collection of cover art from the extensive history of my WIDOW series, first published in 1992. Last year, I released a similar comic, MAXIMUM WIDOW UNCOVERED, a pin-up book featuring a slew of cover art images from the various adult variants that have been published over the years (UNCOVERED is available as an Add-On, by the way- see the bottom of the page for Add-On books). Many crowdfunding backers really enjoyed that one, and I've had numerous request to release a similar book that collects Emma's PG-13 cover appearances, so here it is, with exclusive Indiegogo variant covers!</p>

<p>  MAXIMUM WIDOW EXHIBITION contains 24 pages of full color art, reprinting the best and most unique WIDOW images ever, by artists such as Michael Avon Oeming, Karl Waller, Jude Millien, Dan Parsons, Jason Christensen, and others, including (naturally) me.</p>

<p>  Many of these images came from the covers of my FANGS OF THE WIDOW series, while others are from the WIDOW X reprint series that was published by Avatar Press. The only problem with producing this book was that I don't have any of my original art, nor do I have a single digital file of any of the final, colored cover art. What I had to do was obtain printed copies of all of the books I needed, scan the covers, then do a crap-ton of Photoshop work on them to clean them up and digitally remove the various company and series logos. That was NOT easy, but the work is done and the book is ready to go to press!</p>

</div></div>","THIS JUST IN! We've reached our goal amount, so that means that it's time to announce (and hopefully unlock) Stretch Goals! Here's the first:

What is MAXIMUM WIDOW EXHIBITION?
  MAXIMUM WIDOW EXHIBITION is a new collection of cover art from the extensive history of my WIDOW series, first published in 1992. Last year, I released a similar comic, MAXIMUM WIDOW UNCOVERED, a pin-up book featuring a slew of cover art images from the various adult variants that have been published over the years (UNCOVERED is available as an Add-On, by the way- see the bottom of the page for Add-On books). Many crowdfunding backers really enjoyed that one, and I've had numerous request to release a similar book that collects Emma's PG-13 cover appearances, so here it is, with exclusive Indiegogo variant covers!

  MAXIMUM WIDOW EXHIBITION contains 24 pages of full color art, reprinting the best and most unique WIDOW images ever, by artists such as Michael Avon Oeming, Karl Waller, Jude Millien, Dan Parsons, Jason Christensen, and others, including (naturally) me.

  Many of these images came from the covers of my FANGS OF THE WIDOW series, while others are from the WIDOW X reprint series that was published by Avatar Press. The only problem with producing this book was that I don't have any of my original art, nor do I have a single digital file of any of the final, colored cover art. What I had to do was obtain printed copies of all of the books I needed, scan the covers, then do a crap-ton of Photoshop work on them to clean them up and digitally remove the various company and series logos. That was NOT easy, but the work is done and the book is ready to go to press!
What kind of goodies will you get by backing MAXIMUM WIDOW EXHIBITION?
   The main perk is the wraparound cover edition of MAXIMUM WIDOW EXHIBITION, available in either print or digital. But you guys know me, and I know what you like... So I've created a nude cover variant, sporting steamy, never-before-seen art!

  And oh, no... It doesn't end there! I've also created a scorching hot ""Valentine"" variant for the true collectors out there!

   As you might have noticed in the graphics above, I'm making ALL THREE editions super-collectible by making all print copies signed and numbered, and limited to the number of backers! Let's say, for example, that only 30 of you reserve a copy of the nude edition- That means that this signed & numbered edition will be limited to ONLY 30 COPIES! CRAZY, huh?
  What other goodies am I offering to make this even more attractive? How about those ever-popular WIDOW TRADING CARDS?

  These three cards are a booster set to the existing WIDOW card set and can be enjoyed on their own, but the entire, previous 35-card set can also be obtained at various levels or as an add-on. The first 26 cards that come with this set were printed in 1997 and are already rare collectibles! Includes signed & numbered autograph card!
  There's the basics! Now, let's have a look at...

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The comic is done, save for a few updates I want to make since I finished it as a graduation project. While the project is being funded, I will take some time to translate the text from <strong>spanish</strong>, the original language, to <strong>english</strong>. I will also be revising the entire comic for any errors I might have missed, repainting some stuff I want to redo and push my work further. The estimated delivery of the comics will be July, but will be working hard to deliver them sooner.</p>
<p>I will also be work on some of the prizes I will be offering, like original prints.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There are a couple of reasons why I want to publish this book. The first one would be to fulfill the parameters for my graduation and have a quality product to exhibit and offer. Second, this is a presentation card from me to those interested in digital painting and comics.

I wanted to make something fun, positive, for families and children to have fun with. To introduce them  or make them comfortable with reading, with being inquisitive, with their own imaginations and to ask questions about the world.</p>

<h3><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522297141/yfjsd8zcmjxcccjnho1j.jpg"" src=""""/>Background:</strong></h3>
<p>Since I was a kid, inferred from my parents and grandparents, I’ve liked to make hands-on models, do scientific experiments, and create artworks and “inventions”. After completing my engineering degree, I have been working for Fortune 500 companies and start-ups in Silicon Valley, California as a technologist, engineer, and new product development leader. Also I’m an artist and art/science teacher for kids as my part-time career. In my graduate study, I created a couple of comics in my class presentation materials to demonstrate the research concepts. Then I made some comic strips, after another, and tried them in local children’s science camps and my art/cartoon classes. I received pretty good feedbacks from the professors, classmates, and my students.</p>
<p>My daily life—from the thrill of starting a new idea, to the long and harsh days dedicated to development, and finally to the moments of celebrating a new-product launch—all of them have inspired me to create this story. Therefore, I decided to combine my techno and education experiences, and art skills to make comics and animated film series to give today’s kids a production that’s not only for fun but also for learning something useful for their studies, careers, and future development.</p>
<p>Because I have a busy full-time job at a leading position of a fast-growing Silicon Valley company, plus my part time jobs, I have to devote most of my evenings, weekends and holidays to this creation. Now after several years of dedication, it's the time to start a new journey: making Kid Inventors! Publishing this book is just the beginning!</p>

<p>Early-age education is very important for students to attract them to the technical field. Most famous scientists and inventors started their learning and creating practices at early ages. These stories provide fun and interesting ways to attract children to explore their imagination and interests in technical fields.</p>
<p>Today’s youngsters use all kinds of high-tech stuffs, such as smartphones, tablets, computers, tech toys, etc. However, not too many students know about the scientific and technical backgrounds behind these devices.  It's a perfect reading and learning material for your kids in this Summer.  </p>

Evil robots, virus, and neutral disasters, …to save the planet, they have to fight! They are using their inventions and capabilities, they are taking actions…

The Book:  Features and Uniqueness
Drawn, designed, and written by Ed Shen, Kid Inventors contains a lot of short stories to form many episodes. which is also for the purpose to make animation TV/Internet show series.  It uses a mix of comics and descriptions—including theme, emotion, and technical descriptions such as hints, ideas, notes, and mentor’s explanations—to help readers better understand the background of each story. The book is funny, exciting, scary, sad, happy, mysterious, lighthearted, and family friendly…and hopefully evocative of emotions and experiences you’ve encountered in your daily life or your younger days.

<h3>CGI Buffalo Comic Series</h3>
<p>My name is Tom De Geeter from Marathon of Dope and I'm the creator of a new comic book series called CGI Buffalo. Drawing, graphic design and music have been my passion for the last 20 years. I'm glad to say it's also been my daily income for the last 15 years.</p>
<p>I wrote this first script and created the comic over the course of the last year. I’m really proud of the series I created and I think you’re gonna like it. I’m asking for your support to create physical copies of the first 3 issues.</p>
<p><strong>So what is CGI Buffalo about?</strong><br/>Its a biographical black comedy-drama, set in an innercity environment. It tells the story of Ceegee, a buffalo slash man suffering from extreme memory loss who must figure out who he is. After Ceegee gets a bunch of clues trough his every day life of being a radio host and hanging at the local record store, he goes into a downward spiral of paranoia and delusion. </p>

<div>In the summer of 2015, Dustin Meadows (that's me!) founded Whiskey Bear Comedy with the express purpose of producing quality comedy shows under a memorable banner to maintain consistency while growing and retaining a dedicated comedy audience. In 2014 and 2015 I produced the Columbus Comedy Festival, a staple of the Columbus comedy scene since 2010 that focused on showcasing comedians within the city. In 2015, the Columbus Comedy Festival was expanded to include comedians from neighboring cities in Ohio, and I also produced Rock Bottom Fest, a two night comedy show featuring comedians from all over Ohio as well as Chicago and Tennessee.</div>
<div>The plan was always to continue building towards a festival that would showcase some of Columbus' best comics and venues while also bringing in exciting new talent from across the country as well as national headliners, to bring them to our city and show them that the 614 can actually be a pretty dope place, for comedy, as well as other things. And this year, it's finally happening with the first ever Whiskey Bear Comedy Festival, which I'm producing with fellow Columbus comedians Lisa Berry and Tom Plute.</div>
<div>There's a lot of great comedy going on in smaller towns, from our sister cities in Cincinnati and Cleveland to places like Fort Wayne or Knoxville. Those cities have been an inspiration to myself, and I think Columbus could one day be on the same level as those places, and that's what Whiskey Bear Comedy is all about. That's what this festival is all about.</div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We're shooting to raise $4,000 to help us cover the costs associated with producing an independent festival</p>
<p>$1,200-Compensation, food and lodging for our headliner and traveling show runners</p>
<p>$1,300-Promotional materials, website and sponsored advertising</p>
<p>$1,500-Amenities for performers including welcome packages and providing food/drink so we can show everyone a little Midwest hospitality</p>
<p>The festival will feature several local showcases and even local specialty shows like <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Whiskeydeepplute/?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Whiskey Deep</a> and <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/The-Pop-Culture-Mixtape-279040205587839/?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Pop Culture Mixtape</a>.</p>
<p>We're also excited to be bringing the following shows into Columbus, some for the very first time!</p> <ul>

<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>At the end of the day, the mission of the Whiskey Bear Comedy Festival is two-fold. First and foremost, we want to put on the best comedy show we can. We want to create a week of comedy programming that's just as much fun for our audience as it is for our performers.</p>
<p>Secondly, and in a big picture sense of things, we want people who come to Columbus to perform comedy to want to come back to Columbus to perform comedy. We want the people who live here in Columbus to know that there's amazing comedy, several nights a month, that they can come out and see and be a part of. Because at the end of the day, comics need an audience more than an audience needs comics. It's the only way we grow, it's the only way we get better. Comedy in this city has been very good. Let's make it great.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>The biggest concern in producing comedy is always ""Will people come to these shows?"" It's a fear that never goes away unless you're someone like Louis C.K. or Bill Burr and you're booking theaters at $40-50 a head. Having produced three festivals as well as performing in several over the past few years, you tend to pick up a few things. I've been fortunate enough to have a pretty solid track record with the festivals I've been involved in, whether as producer or performer. But that fear is still very real, no matter how many positive experiences you've had. It's a lot of work pulling off a comedy festival, and even more work pulling off a successful one. A lot of work has already gone into this festival, well before this campaign launched, and even more is going to go into it during and long after the campaign ends. The greatest fear is that if we're not successful, a lot of people are going to walk away from this festival and Columbus with a negative impression of comedy in this city. But I'm confident that when all is said and done, we'll have pulled it off. So what do you say? Let's all be heroes.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
In the summer of 2015, Dustin Meadows (that's me!) founded Whiskey Bear Comedy with the express purpose of producing quality comedy shows under a memorable banner to maintain consistency while growing and retaining a dedicated comedy audience. In 2014 and 2015 I produced the Columbus Comedy Festival, a staple of the Columbus comedy scene since 2010 that focused on showcasing comedians within the city. In 2015, the Columbus Comedy Festival was expanded to include comedians from neighboring cities in Ohio, and I also produced Rock Bottom Fest, a two night comedy show featuring comedians from all over Ohio as well as Chicago and Tennessee.
The plan was always to continue building towards a festival that would showcase some of Columbus' best comics and venues while also bringing in exciting new talent from across the country as well as national headliners, to bring them to our city and show them that the 614 can actually be a pretty dope place, for comedy, as well as other things. And this year, it's finally happening with the first ever Whiskey Bear Comedy Festival, which I'm producing with fellow Columbus comedians Lisa Berry and Tom Plute.
There's a lot of great comedy going on in smaller towns, from our sister cities in Cincinnati and Cleveland to places like Fort Wayne or Knoxville. Those cities have been an inspiration to myself, and I think Columbus could one day be on the same level as those places, and that's what Whiskey Bear Comedy is all about. That's what this festival is all about.
   What We Need & What You Get We're shooting to raise $4,000 to help us cover the costs associated with producing an independent festival
$1,200-Compensation, food and lodging for our headliner and traveling show runners
$1,300-Promotional materials, website and sponsored advertising
$1,500-Amenities for performers including welcome packages and providing food/drink so we can show everyone a little Midwest hospitality
The festival will feature several local showcases and even local specialty shows like Whiskey Deep and The Pop Culture Mixtape.
We're also excited to be bringing the following shows into Columbus, some for the very first time! 

Underwear Comedy Party, hosted by Joe Pettis

Dungeon: A Comedy Role-Playing Show, hosted by Remi Treuer

Me & Paranormal You, hosted by our festival headliner Ryan Singer






Many of the shows will take place at Mikey's Late Night Slice, located in downtown Columbus, as well as satellite shows throughout the weekend. For more details, visit whiskeybearcomedyfestival.com!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi I’m Lisa, aka Baggy on the web. I need $800 to cover the costs to print a variety of books based on my own comic series<strong> Madam Butterscotch.</strong></p>

<p>You can read the first 3 Chapters for <strong>FREE</strong> online at my smackjeeves -&gt; <a href=""http://madambutterscotch.smackjeeves.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://madambutterscotch.smackjeeves.com/</a></p>

</div>
<div>
<h3>Who am I?:</h3>
<p>My name is<em> Lisa Cummins</em> or <em>Baggy</em> if you’ve seen me on the web or at conventions.</p>
<p><img alt=""Myself at May London Expo 2012"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i51.photobucket.com/albums/f396/lcummi/2012-05-26085508.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Me looking derp""/></p>
<p>I’m an animation and illustration Graduate from the UK, currently working on various freelance projects in the UK convention scene.<br/>I’ve had my work published in magazines, including <strong>NEO Magazine</strong> and various anthologies, including <strong>Non Repro’s Nami: Manga Jiman</strong> and <strong>Yum!Jinka.</strong></p>
<p>I love to draw and would love to make working in comics my career and not in my mum and dad’s pub, no matter how much I love them.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What’s the money for then?</h3>
<p>I’ve spent the last 4 years working hard on my own comic series, <strong>Madam Butterscotch</strong> – a thriller based black and white comic about the life and (hitman!) alter ego of mother and tea shop owner, Tilda Llewellyn:<br/><br/><em>Having come out of hiding and moved to a quaint little town, she is forced to re-enter her old world to ensure peace and happiness for herself and her daughter - but can she balance being a killing machine and a mother?.</em></p>
<p>It’s full of great characters, witty banter, English satire, plenty of action, mystery, intrigue, GUNS! and<em> Tea</em>.</p>
<p>It’s been in print for a year now and I have 3 chapters available to read online. But with each chapter printed, means more costs. <br/>By the end of this year I will have Chapter 4 and the first Volume ready; Volume 1 will contain <em>ALL 4 CHAPTERS</em>, a bonus short comic and some art.<br/> I also have a stack of artwork, which I would love to be able to turn into an Art Book, which will include all the conceptual art for Butterscotch and the various characters and environments, how Butterscotch started, thumbnail process – how I go about making a page, special fan-art section of all the art that has been made of Butterscotch, as well as some special competition entries.</p>
<p>So to sum up…<br/>I need $800 to fund the costs of printing;<br/>*<strong> copies of Chapter 4 </strong><br/>*<strong> copies of Volume 1</strong></p>
<p>-       All 4 chapters<br/>-       Bonus Comic short<br/>-       Bonus Art<br/>* <strong>copies of <em>Bullets and Sugar-cubes: the Art of Butterscotch</em>.</strong><br/>-       Concept Art<br/>-       Character Art and processes<br/>-       How it all began<br/>-       Page process – tutorial<br/>-       Fan art expose</p>
<p>Some Stats:<br/>Chapter 4 –</p>
<ul>
<li><em>24 pages</em></li>
<li><em>A5 size - approx.  8.3 x 5.8 in</em></li>
<li><em>Black and white</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Volume 1 –</p>
<ul>
<li><em>80+ pages</em></li>
<li><em>A5 size – approx.  8.3 x 5.8 in</em></li>
<li><em>Black and white</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Bullets and Sugar-cubes: The Art of Butterscotch</p>
<ul>
<li><em>60+ pages</em></li>
<li><em>A4 size – approx. 11.7 x 8.3 in</em></li>
<li><em>Full Colour</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>Sounds great! How about some pretties!</h3>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Hi I’m Lisa, aka Baggy on the web. I need $800 to cover the costs to print a variety of books based on my own comic series Madam Butterscotch.
I will be offering some fantastic perks for anyone who wishes to contribute. I’m very excited about all the progress that’s going on with the Butterscotch collection and I’m keen to share all updates with you guys.
You can read the first 3 Chapters for FREE online at my smackjeeves -> http://madambutterscotch.smackjeeves.com/
If you like what you see, then please contribute to keep the series going, so I can get it in print for all you lovely, shiny people.
You can also see my art and keep up to date with me via:

Facebook Page - https://www.facebook.com/pages/Baggy/285445138178855




Who am I?:
My name is Lisa Cummins or Baggy if you’ve seen me on the web or at conventions.

I’m an animation and illustration Graduate from the UK, currently working on various freelance projects in the UK convention scene.I’ve had my work published in magazines, including NEO Magazine and various anthologies, including Non Repro’s Nami: Manga Jiman and Yum!Jinka.
I love to draw and would love to make working in comics my career and not in my mum and dad’s pub, no matter how much I love them.


What’s the money for then?
I’ve spent the last 4 years working hard on my own comic series, Madam Butterscotch – a thriller based black and white comic about the life and (hitman!) alter ego of mother and tea shop owner, Tilda Llewellyn:Having come out of hiding and moved to a quaint little town, she is forced to re-enter her old world to ensure peace and happiness for herself and her daughter - but can she balance being a killing machine and a mother?.
It’s full of great characters, witty banter, English satire, plenty of action, mystery, intrigue, GUNS! and Tea.
It’s been in print for a year now and I have 3 chapters available to read online. But with each chapter printed, means more costs. By the end of this year I will have Chapter 4 and the first Volume ready; Volume 1 will contain ALL 4 CHAPTERS, a bonus short comic and some art. I also have a stack of artwork, which I would love to be able to turn into an Art Book, which will include all the conceptual art for Butterscotch and the various characters and environments, how Butterscotch started, thumbnail process – how I go about making a page, special fan-art section of all the art that has been made of Butterscotch, as well as some special competition entries.
So to sum up…I need $800 to fund the costs of printing;* copies of Chapter 4 * copies of Volume 1
-       All 4 chapters-       Bonus Comic short-       Bonus Art* copies of Bullets and Sugar-cubes: the Art of Butterscotch.-       Concept Art-       Character Art and processes-       How it all began-       Page process – tutorial-       Fan art expose
Some Stats:Chapter 4 –

24 pages
A5 size - approx.  8.3 x 5.8 in
Black and white

Volume 1 –

80+ pages
A5 size – approx.  8.3 x 5.8 in
Black and white

Bullets and Sugar-cubes: The Art of Butterscotch

60+ pages
A4 size – approx. 11.7 x 8.3 in
Full Colour

Sounds great! How about some pretties!
For those who are unfamiliar with my work, here’s some images from Butterscotch, as well as some other random images of mine.

</div></div>","We have recently funded The Wardenclyffe Horror in a successful Kickstarter campaign. So why are we here? The search for more money and profit?
Not exactly. My partner and I want to take this product to a comic con or two next year. Our crowd funding efforts to date will pay for most of the costs related to hiring an artist and getting it printed, but they will stretch no further. Worse - this project will still tie up most of our spare financial resources for the forseeable future. So if we really want to get the word out, we're going to need your help!
We know your help doesn't come cheap, though. Fortunately we have a pretty cool reward to offer: The Wardenclyffe Horror! 

The Wardenclyffe Horror is a 92 page graphic novel set in New York, 1908, a (mostly) unremarkable year. It follows Nikola Tesla and Mark Twain through the events of a horror story that explores what happens when fringe science goes horribly awry.
Want to know more? See for yourself (click on each picture for a larger version):






The story is finished, the script written, and the funding secured. The artists have been found, contracted, and even now are making progress toward the end goal at four or five pages a week. Sometime before the end of April, the art will be complete and we'll be off to the printers; a few weeks after that, they will arrive on our doorstep, and we will start sending them out to you, our loyal supporters. 
Then we're (hopefully) off to one or more comic cons!
Want to buy more copies?

If you are pledged at the $24 level and above, you can buy additional copies for $18. 

If you are pledged at any level that grants you an art print, you can get an additional art print for $5. 

There are worse problems to have. Money in excess of our goal will go to improve the rewards, and extend our reach. 

We have several goals in mind for the following levels of funding: 
At $500, I will attend the Denver Comic Con.
At $1000, my partner will attend a Con in the bay area. 
At $2000, I will commision a special print of Wardenclyffe Tower for all of our great Indiegogo supporters who pledge at least $30. 
At $3000, we will both also attend the San Diego Comic Con. 
At $5000, I will attend each of the above Conventions dressed as Nikola Tesla.

<h2>UPDATE</h2>
<p>6 days to go and we've made 2% of our target. I think it's safe to assume that we won't hit 100%, but it's far from over for the Outback Ninja. The first book will release soon and there will be more, but without some money to back us up it's going to take a longer time to make each issue.</p>
<p>If you referred your friends to this page I thank you from the bottom of my heart, maybe even the bottom of my liver, possibly my balls but I wouldn't go any lower than that. Keep supporting the book and it'll keep getting new issues.</p>

<h3>What's All This About?</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Aaron Ross and I am the creator, artist and writer of Outback Ninja, a violent but funny comic book from Australia. </p>
<p>For years I've wanted to put out a book but it's taken me 28 human earth years to actually get it done. This campaign is all about helping me achieve my dream. All contributions will go towards releasing the first book - which apparently isn't cheap, who'd have known!? - and will also go towards making and distributing future issues of Outback Ninja.</p>
<p>At the moment there is a 6 book arc planned out for Outback Ninja but who knows what could come of the character in the future if things go well.</p>
<h3>What's In It For Me? (Meaning You, the reader)</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>If we reach our goal you'll get to read a kick-ass book - not ""Kick-Ass"" the crime fighter, he already has a comic of his own, but in the general way that kick-ass could be used before that guy existed - but you'll also help breath life into a new Australian comic book hero. We don't have a huge comic book creation culture here in Oz and there's not many comics that take place here, so I wanted to make a book that is unique to us. Yeah, there's a ninja, but he's wearing an Akubra... So take that! </p>
<p>Look to the right to see the full list of perks for contributors, needless to say, there's some cool stuff to be found in contributing to the cause. If you're still not convinced, head to the gallery for an 11 page preview of the first issue.</p>

<p><strong>THE STORY</strong></p>
<p>The year is 1895...An evil from a parallel dimension escaped and now roams the city of Boston. Faced with a new century and new steam technology, the social and political status quo is turned on its head. People are uncomfortable with change and, in fact, many people fear it. That fear and the violence which follows causes a psychic rift to puncture the veil of space and time allowing the entity known as ""The Shifter"" to escape. Feeding on the resentment and fear between the rich and poor, “The Shifter” triggers a rash of murders.</p>
<p>Four of the greatest minds of the time have banded together to try and stop this malevolent entity. Known only as B.E.T.H., they are:</p>

<h3>The Story Behind The Story</h3>
<p>I love writing BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY. Not only does it bring my love of science fiction and history together, (which by the way, equals steampunk), the steampunk time period allows me to address the themes of classism, sexism, and racism in America in a thoughtful and entertaining way. For at it's very core, BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY is an American story. And you can't tell an American story without including women and people of color.</p>
<p>It has been and always will be important to me to write characters who, though they come from diverse backgrounds and have different points of view, are able to work together for the common good.</p>
<p>BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY began as a TV Pilot which I wrote while I was in the MFA Program in Screenwriting at UCLA. It was somewhat inspired by a script I had written called Stargazer, which was about a real life astronomer who lived in Boston in the late 1880's. (Stargazer went on to win the Sloan Fellowship.) It was suggested that I adapt Boston Metaphysical into a six issue graphic novel mini-series. I agreed and the hunt was on for an artist. Many months later, I met Emily Hu through a mutual friend and a partnership was born. Her passion for the project matched my own and I knew the story was in good hands. I launched BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY as a webcomic in May of 2012. The following year we printed a special edition of the first chapter.</p>
<p>Through a combination of self-funding and the generous support of Kickstarter backers like you, we were able to finish the six issue series and now we are back to print this expanded version of the trade.</p>
<p>However by wading into the deep end of the pool, I discovered a terrible truth – I love writing comics.</p>
<p>So I bring you Samuel, Caitlin, and Granville who represent the best, the worst, and every shade of gray of the society in which they live. They are products of their world yet strive for not only more, but better.</p>
<p>Much like you and I.</p>
<p>By backing this project, you would not only be supporting the printing of the trade paperback, but a vision of a future where the teamwork and sacrifice of a diverse group of individuals ultimately defeats evil.</p>
<h3>INCENTIVES</h3>
<p>In addition to the 156 page trade paperback which includes a brand new ten page story, we have a BRAND NEW bookmark, the anthology, Boston Metaphysical Society: Prelude, scripts of the new ten page story (pdf and in hardcopy), plus a NEW LAPEL PIN with Caitlin's box camera. It is 1 inch in diameter and will be an antique gold color. (See image below.)</p>

The year is 1895...An evil from a parallel dimension escaped and now roams the city of Boston. Faced with a new century and new steam technology, the social and political status quo is turned on its head. People are uncomfortable with change and, in fact, many people fear it. That fear and the violence which follows causes a psychic rift to puncture the veil of space and time allowing the entity known as ""The Shifter"" to escape. Feeding on the resentment and fear between the rich and poor, “The Shifter” triggers a rash of murders.
Four of the greatest minds of the time have banded together to try and stop this malevolent entity. Known only as B.E.T.H., they are:

THEY FAIL.
Against their better judgment, they look to a man driven by revenge – SAMUEL HUNTER.


 For the one mistake ""The Shifter"" made was killing Samuel’s wife.
An ex-Pinkerton detective, Samuel gathers his unlikely team of…
Caitlin O'Sullivan, Medium and Spirit Photographer:

 and Granville Woods, Scientist Extraordinaire:

 
They are the Boston Metaphysical Society.
Their job: Stop ""The Shifter"" before Boston tears itself apart.

The man is a true professional and you should look up his work the first chance you get.<br/><br/>*On to the introductions!  My name is Kevin Chilcoat and this is my very first Indiegogo campaign for a comic book that I’ve written Knight In The Snake Pit.  I’m going to give all of you a brief overview of my background and experience of what has compelled me to write this series.</p><p> </p><p>*For starters, I have a film background.  My brother and I co-own a video production company who until recently have been on a bit of a hiatus.  We never made feature films, even though that was/is our dream, but we did successfully make a living for a little while doing corporate videos and live event production.  That’s a long story as short as I can put it.  I can say that writing a screenplay and writing a script for a comic book are extremely similar, so creating a comic book ends up being a lot less costly than making movies and you still get to tell your story.  The way this first issue is written is as if it was a pilot episode for a TV series.</p><p> </p><p>*I have to be somewhat vague about the Knight In The Snake Pit story, as this first issue is only 22 pages.  I can assure you that a lot went into these 22 pages and it’s taken me a few months to even get here.  This has been a concept that I’ve been toying around with for some time and what this story does is mashes up two pretty different genres. </p><p> </p><p>*The first is a story set in a mental asylum with a similar setting to Shutter Island.  The year is 1947 and these sorts of hospitals are overcrowded and understaffed.  The conditions are poor and the lobotomy is a treatment that has really become the “go to” for certain patients.  Our main character, Allister Ward, awakens from his latest treatment, which is Deep Sleep Therapy, where’s he’s been in and out of comas for an extended period of time.  This therapy has led to him awakening with no memory of who he is or anything about why he has come to be a patient at this asylum.  At this point, all he has are the words of the doctors, who are telling him that in the past, he’s had delusions of another world that he and he alone travels to where there’s a kingdom in peril and a princess that needs to be rescued.   None of this seems to make any sense to Allister until he starts to experience these delusions firsthand.  Allister must now determine what’s real and discover how he’s ended up in this hospital when he’s one false move from receiving a lobotomy.</p><p> </p><p>*This is the second comic book I’ve ever written.  The first one is titled Run For Your Lives, which was a comic book that was created for a 5k Run Event with the same name where participants are being chased by zombies.  The way the event worked was each participant had a flag belt, which resembled their health.  They would run on a zombie infested obstacle course and if they made it from the start to the finish line with any of their flags in tact, then they survived the zombie apocalypse. </p><p> </p><p>-The way I wrote and approached the Run For Your Lives comic book, which was brilliantly illustrated by Kyle Strahm, was I took aspects of the event and the zombie genre itself and created an origin story for the tournament.  This book shows the world ending via the zombie apocalypse and when all hope is lost, there was a billion dollar corporation who built safe havens, scattered across the United States, as a Noah’s Ark, so humanity had a chance to start over again.  When outsiders unsuccessfully try to invade these safe havens for their resources, the founder creates a tournament for new admittances to participate in to prove their worth and loyalty.  This tournament is the “Run For Your Lives” tournament, where participants have to make it from the start to finish line and not be torn to shreds in the process.  If the participants survived the tournament, then they’re admitted in the community and celebrated for their bravery.  If they don’t make it, then they just end up being additional zombies on the course.</p><p> </p><p>-Issue #1 of Run For Your Lives was created as an origin story and along with that, I’ve written an entire script to either create a comic book series or a feature length film.  Depending on how this campaign goes and sort of response I receive, I may make one to fund the creation of the Run For Your Lives series.  This origin issue was sold at the events that went on nationwide.  After the second year running, the company who ran the event went bankrupt, leaving me with a fair amount of these comic books.  What is great is that you can’t find these anywhere else so if you donate the $15 pledge and up, you can get your hands on a copy.</p><p> </p><p>*The way that Knight In The Snake Pit #1 differs from Run For Your Lives #1 is that it is a story that introduces all of your key characters, there’s plenty of story and dialogue to go around and will (hopefully) leave you wanting more and to find out how everything unfolds.  Run For Your Lives plays out like a one-shot where it’s all origin and paints a world where a story can take place, but there’s plenty of carnage to go around in those pages.</p><p> </p><p>*When Issue #1 of Knight In The Snake Pit gets printed, it’ll be great to see the response and to either keep making them independently, or try to contact publishers to see about picking it up as a series.  That is the bigger picture for this series, but that all starts here.</p><p> </p><p>*As I state in the video, for everyone who donates money to this campaign, you will all be included in the Acknowledgements/Thank You section.  I’m not trying to toot this project’s horn or nuthin, but there really is only one opportunity to get your name in a comic book’s first print of the first issue.  In the slim chance that this book becomes the next big thing, you can say you were there from the start and tell your friends that you’re the true fan, while all others are posers. </p><p> </p><p>*INFLUENCES:  As I said below, part of this story, being set in a mental asylum, has themes similar to Shutter Island.  While there are other great movies/stories that have mental hospital settings, such as 12 Monkeys, Beautiful Mind and One Who Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest, I wanted to keep this closer to the era, but also try and go for a David Fincher vibe.  With the Fantasy element, story wise, there’s aspects of Game of Thrones (that’s popular, right?) and Army of Darkness with a sprinkle of Mario Brothers.</p><p> </p><p>*IS IT FOR THE KIDS?  Nope.  However, if I were to compare this issue to a movie, I would say it’s a hard PG-13.  I say this because there are two “F” words that are used.  I believe that they are used very appropriately…you’ll see.  Also, and I know it’s rare this day in age, but I’ve definitely seen PG-13 movies with two “F” words.  I remember because I was like, “Whoa now, let me check the rating of this again!”  Later issues of this series like the next one for instance, could definitely dwell a little in the R territory.</p></div>","Written and Created by Kevin

in and out of comas for an extended period of time.  This therapy has led to him awakening with no memory of who he is or anything about why he has come to be a patient at this asylum.  At this point, all he has are the words of the doctors, who are telling him that in the past, he’s had delusions of another world that he and he alone travels to where there’s a kingdom in peril and a princess that needs to be rescued.   None of this seems to make any sense to Allister until he starts to experience these delusions firsthand.  Allister must now determine what’s real and discover how he’s ended up in this hospital when he’s one false move from receiving a lobotomy. *This is the second comic book I’ve ever written.  The first one is titled Run For Your Lives, which was a comic book that was created for a 5k Run Event with the same name where participants are being chased by zombies.  The way the event worked was each participant had a flag belt, which resembled their health.  They would run on a zombie infested obstacle course and if they made it from the start to the finish line with any of their flags in tact, then they survived the zombie apocalypse.  -The way I wrote and approached the Run For Your Lives comic book, which was brilliantly illustrated by Kyle Strahm, was I took aspects of the event and the zombie genre itself and created an origin story for the tournament.  This book shows the world ending via the zombie apocalypse and when all hope is lost, there was a billion dollar corporation who built safe havens, scattered across the United States, as a Noah’s Ark, so humanity had a chance to start over again.  When outsiders unsuccessfully try to invade these safe havens for their resources, the founder creates a tournament for new admittances to participate in to prove their worth and loyalty.  This tournament is the “Run For Your Lives” tournament, where participants have to make it from the start to finish line and not be torn to shreds in the process.  If the participants survived the tournament, then they’re admitted in the community and celebrated for their bravery.  If they don’t make it, then they just end up being additional zombies on the course. -Issue #1 of Run For Your Lives was created as an origin story and along with that, I’ve written an entire script to either create a comic book series or a feature length film.  Depending on how this campaign goes and sort of response I receive, I may make one to fund the creation of the Run For Your Lives series.  This origin issue was sold at the events that went on nationwide.  After the second year running, the company who ran the event went bankrupt, leaving me with a fair amount of these comic books.  What is great is that you can’t find these anywhere else so if you donate the $15 pledge and up, you can get your hands on a copy. *The way that Knight In The Snake Pit #1 differs from Run For Your Lives #1 is that it is a story that introduces all of your key characters, there’s plenty of story and dialogue to go around and will (hopefully) leave you wanting more and to find out how everything unfolds.  Run For Your Lives plays out like a one-shot where it’s all origin and paints a world where a story can take place, but there’s plenty of carnage to go around in those pages. *When Issue #1 of Knight In The Snake Pit gets printed, it’ll be great to see the response and to either keep making them independently, or try to contact publishers to see about picking it up as a series.  That is the bigger picture for this series, but that all starts here. *As I state in the video, for everyone who donates money to this campaign, you will all be included in the Acknowledgements/Thank You section.  I’m not trying to toot this project’s horn or nuthin, but there really is only one opportunity to get your name in a comic book’s first print of the first issue.  In the slim chance that this book becomes the next big thing, you can say you were there from the start and tell your friends that you’re the true fan, while all others are posers.  *INFLUENCES:  As I said below, part of this story, being set in a mental asylum, has themes similar to Shutter Island.  While there are other great movies/stories that have mental hospital settings, such as 12 Monkeys, Beautiful Mind and One Who Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest, I wanted to keep this closer to the era, but also try and go for a David Fincher vibe.  With the Fantasy element, story wise, there’s aspects of Game of Thrones (that’s popular, right?) and Army of Darkness with a sprinkle of Mario Brothers. *IS IT FOR THE KIDS?  Nope.  However, if I were to compare this issue to a movie, I would say it’s a hard PG-13.  I say this because there are two “F” words that are used.  I believe that they are used very appropriately…you’ll see.  Also, and I know it’s rare this day in age, but I’ve definitely seen PG-13 movies with two “F” words.  I remember because I was like, “Whoa now, let me check the rating of this again!”  Later issues of this series like the next one for instance, could definitely dwell a little in the R territory.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Ryan and I have been compiling our stories for many years and formulated a concept.

<p>Donnybrook is an honest and unfiltered glimpse into hockey culture that doesn’t pull punches or hold back -- much like the classic Paul Newman film <i>Slap Shot</i>.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>Welcome to the second round of IndieGoGo for our project! We got off to a rough start last year. Life seemed to beat us down at every turn. Between home issues, illness issues and financial problems, we nearly hung it up. But because of the generosity and the outpouring of help from our friends, families, and supporters we pressed on and have made it through! And before we go any further, we want to extend our deepest and sincerest apologies for the length of time it took us to ship out our perk orders last time. But they were all shipped and to our knowledge, all were received. We won't have that issue again!</p>
<p>But we are now headed into our first year of conventions and have two on tap already. We'll be headed to Derby City Comic Convention in Louisville, KY the weekend of June 20-21st and then headed to Cincinnati Comics Expo in September. But in order to make this year the best ever, we need your help! </p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> </div><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><div> </div><p>We'll be frank. Print media is not a cheap venue to get into. In fact, the other day, someone asked us if we were making money yet. We jokingly told them that we were losing less money than when we started. The truth is that while we are making money with this project, it is barely enough to keep things moving forward. All three of our core members are working multiple ""real jobs"" to help keep this project afloat and still be able to pay our personal bills. But here's what we need and how you can help us get there:</p><div>
</div><p>Print Costs:</p><div>
</div><p>We realistically need about $1000 to be able to cover our print costs in any real volume. Why so much? Well, we did some shopping and have compared pricing for printing comics. At our level of distribution, it currently costs us $2.62 per issue to print our books. And when you sell them at $3.99 per issue, you can see where other sales are what really keep the project afloat. Now if we are ever able to start bolstering our printing runs and selling more copies, this cost will obviously fall per issue. But right now, this is where we stand.</p><div>
</div><p>Why Not Go Digital?:</p><div>
</div><p>We here at Project Reclamation fervently recognize the very real connection between a reader and a printed comic book. It creates a tangible, in-the-moment connection with the book and the story. Think about it. If you grab a brand new comic book from your local comics shop, a few things happen immediately. First, your sense of sight locks onto the new book because if the banner-head or the cover art. Then, your sense of touch gets involved when you pick that book up off of the shelf. Thumbing through those pages makes the book all the more real to you. Then the strongest of your senses, your sense of smell, kicks in. You get that whiff of freshly printed ink on paper and your brain homes in on that smell and commits it to memory. You can hear the pages turning as you read, and if you happen to be a thumb-licker (using your tongue to make your thumb tacky so you can turn pages easier), then you even taste a new comic book. So there you have it. Five reasons why Project Reclamation won't ever just settle for digital publishing. But make no mistake, we will have the books available in digital format on Kindle.</p><div>
</div><p>Swag:</p><div>
</div><p>We love our stories and the artists working for us are incredible and getting better every day. We have been able to contract some truly amazing artists to supplement what we are already doing. We were able to hire industry legend Bart Sears, newcomer Erik Reeves, local artist Tressina Bowling, and we were even able to contract a young and very talented artist from Argentina named Emiliano Correa.</p><div>
</div><p>But as we said before, the real money isn't made selling comic books alone, we would love to have even more ways to showcase their work than just the comics. That way we would have items with a higher profit margin that would allow us to continue printing the series and not worry so much about the price break per issue. We would be able to focus on good content and fantastic art and have some awesome items for our friends and fans as well!</p><p> We would love to have some posters, stickers and even t-shirts to put at our tables at conventions and to make available through our  (hopefully) upcoming website. All in all, it will cost us about $200 to get what we need for our first convention.</p><div>
</div><p>Web:</p><div>
</div><p>This brings us to the idea that we need a dot com. In these times, it pays to have dedicated access to your products and services. We are looking to secure our domain name and start running a site where all fans and friends of the series can come to see what's cooking and what's coming up. We also want a place that we can call home. Facebook has been great, but it would be so much nicer to be able to have the functionality that we need and not just base our marketing around whatever is available at the moment. This will cost us about $300</p><div>
</div><p> Travel Expenses:</p><div>
</div><p>With this new expansion, we have accrued a new financial burden. It's one that we gladly bear, but one we could definitely use help with. We have been fortunate to have made enough money to be able to cover the initial costs of entrance to the two conventions we are booked for so far. But now there's the costs of hotel rooms and food and travel costs for three guys and a ton of gear. This cost is tough to put a solid figure on but it's one that we hope will continue. We love doing conventions and are super-excited about finally hitting them with our own project.</p><div>
</div><p> </p><h2>The Impact:</h2><div> <p>Here is Project Rec in a nutshell. We are all fans of the comic book medium. We have collectively been reading comics much longer than the three of us care to disclose. But be that as it may, we have all noticed a saddening trend in comics these days. There is no hope. Comics have become very dark. And while we acknowledge that entertainment media changes with the times, we also know that the ""real world"" is dark enough. So even though our stories start out dark, there is always hope at the end. There is always a redemptive theme. That's our purpose for getting into comics...we want the world to know that no matter how black the night, the morning always comes.</p>  </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> Here are the major challenges we have hit so far:</p>
<p>- Creating a social media presence.</p>
<p>     - We are currently on Facebook, Twitter, Scope, Instagram, Tumblr, Google+ and LinkedIn and our following is growing every day.</p>
<p>     - We recently hit 15,000 views on Scope</p>
<p>     - We are just shy of 800 followers on Twitter</p>
<p>     - We are currently building our Tumblr and Instagram presence through art posts</p>
<p>     - We also joined the Indie Power Alliance, created by the team at New Worlds Comics and it provides a platform for indies and self-publishers to get their work out to a broad audience through cross-marketing with other indies along several  social media platforms.</p>
<p>     - We also received our first outside review this year and issues #0 and #1 were met with a solid review by geek-centric indie blogger, Savannah Baldwin of The Repressed Geek blog. Here's the link: <a href=""http://therepressedgeek.com/?p=718"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://therepressedgeek.com/?p=718</a></p>
<p>Increasing our reach:</p>
<p>     - We are currently working with a small indie publisher in Mexico City to get Reclamation translated into Spanish and to build up a fan base in Mexico, Moka B. Luna Perez and her friends at Collective Triforce have been assisting us with grass-roots, social media marketing in Mexico City and they are awesome!</p>
<p>     - We will also be releasing the Spanish version here in the states as well.</p>
<p>     - We also partnered with our local public library this year to host panels throughout the summer for kids to teach them how to create and make comic books. We were approached by a local comic store owner and told about the idea and we were happy and honored to be asked to be involved. We are truly looking forward to that experience.</p>
<p>Shipping Costs:</p>
<p>     - Apart from printing costs, shipping has been the other major expense.</p>
<p>     - Last year, we shipped comics and posters to Hungary, South Korea, Germany, Mexico, Honduras, England, Canada and Australia. We have shipped some to Argentina this year as well. So as you can see, Reclamation is quickly becoming international!</p>
<p>     - To surmount the costs of shipping internationally (since we have no intention of stopping), we have partnered with our local post office and have worked out shipping rates that are much more wallet-friendly and still guarantee safe, timely deliveries to our international friends and fans.</p>
<p>Expanding The Brand:</p>
<p>     - Last year, we offered inly Reclamation. But there were so many talented people working with us that we couldn't leave it at that. This year in June, we are releasing a one-shot book called Trinity. It will feature three short stories from Reclamation, Axios!, and Isaac &amp; Ishtar.</p>
<p>     - Axios! - written by Travis Huber, Ryan Snelling and Phillip Wilson, with art by Matthew Walker is told from the perspective of demons sent to Earth to hone their skills. It chronicles the way they infect and torment souls in often subtle ways. It shows how demonic presences can come from anywhere, even disguising themselves as beings of light and good. It shows the ways that people can get twisted around by their wiles. But it also shows that there is hope for freedom from their oppression.</p>
<p>     - Isaac &amp; Ishtar - Written By Travis Huber, with art by Tressina Bowling is a story about a soldier who dies in a desert conflict. But before his soul can cross over, he is confronted with a choice by an ancient spirit. Ishtar offers to return Isaac to life. But in return, he must offer his body to be her vessel so that she may once again walk among the living. Not wanting to die, he agrees. She enters him and he is resurrected. But all is not well. When Ishtar becomes bored with the mortal coil, she spices things up by fully taking over Isaac's body and wreaking havoc on the world of men. But once she releases her hold on Isaac after her tantrums, he is left with no memory of what happened, other than the devastation he now sees in front of him. </p>
<p>     - Keeper of Secrets - A title currently in the works. But we're not giving you any details for this one. Let's just say that it continues where the events of the Reclamation series end after issue 12. We promise it's going to be something very cool and this project is very near and dear to all involved.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As you can see, we have gotten very accustomed to adversity and challenges. But no matter what, we are committed to getting our stories out there. We stay in communication with other indie publishers all over and collaborate with them on marketing strategies and ways to get our books out to the masses and garner help from wherever we can. It has been a long road, four years in fact since the beginning...but we are not giving up and we are most definitely not going away!</p>  </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you can't help us out with money, we will never turn down a soul wanting to assist us on this incredible journey! In addition to monetary support, we need help with getting our name out there. A few minutes of your time a couple of days a week and posting our stuff out through your social media pages is always welcomed. Also, word of mouth is a powerful advertisement. In fact, if it hadn't been for the lip service of our friends, families and fans we would've never gotten this far! So please, even if you can't contribute funding, your time is equally as valuable!</p>

But because of the generosity and the outpouring of help from our friends, families, and supporters we pressed on and have made it through! And before we go any further, we want to extend our deepest and sincerest apologies for the length of time it took us to ship out our perk orders last time. But they were all shipped and to our knowledge, all were received. We won't have that issue again!
But we are now headed into our first year of conventions and have two on tap already. We'll be headed to Derby City Comic Convention in Louisville, KY the weekend of June 20-21st and then headed to Cincinnati Comics Expo in September. But in order to make this year the best ever, we need your help! 
   What We Need & What You Get We'll be frank. Print media is not a cheap venue to get into. In fact, the other day, someone asked us if we were making money yet. We jokingly told them that we were losing less money than when we started. The truth is that while we are making money with this project, it is barely enough to keep things moving forward. All three of our core members are working multiple ""real jobs"" to help keep this project afloat and still be able to pay our personal bills. But here's what we need and how you can help us get there:
Print Costs:
We realistically need about $1000 to be able to cover our print costs in any real volume. Why so much? Well, we did some shopping and have compared pricing for printing comics. At our level of distribution, it currently costs us $2.62 per issue to print our books. And when you sell them at $3.99 per issue, you can see where other sales are what really keep the project afloat. Now if we are ever able to start bolstering our printing runs and selling more copies, this cost will obviously fall per issue. But right now, this is where we stand.
Why Not Go Digital?:
We here at Project Reclamation fervently recognize the very real connection between a reader and a printed comic book. It creates a tangible, in-the-moment connection with the book and the story. Think about it. If you grab a brand new comic book from your local comics shop, a few things happen immediately. First, your sense of sight locks onto the new book because if the banner-head or the cover art. Then, your sense of touch gets involved when you pick that book up off of the shelf. Thumbing through those pages makes the book all the more real to you. Then the strongest of your senses, your sense of smell, kicks in. You get that whiff of freshly printed ink on paper and your brain homes in on that smell and commits it to memory. You can hear the pages turning as you read, and if you happen to be a thumb-licker (using your tongue to make your thumb tacky so you can turn pages easier), then you even taste a new comic book. So there you have it. Five reasons why Project Reclamation won't ever just settle for digital publishing. But make no mistake, we will have the books available in digital format on Kindle.
Swag:
We love our stories and the artists working for us are incredible and getting better every day. We have been able to contract some truly amazing artists to supplement what we are already doing. We were able to hire industry legend Bart Sears, newcomer Erik Reeves, local artist Tressina Bowling, and we were even able to contract a young and very talented artist from Argentina named Emiliano Correa.
But as we said before, the real money isn't made selling comic books alone, we would love to have even more ways to showcase their work than just the comics. That way we would have items with a higher profit margin that would allow us to continue printing the series and not worry so much about the price break per issue. We would be able to focus on good content and fantastic art and have some awesome items for our friends and fans as well! We would love to have some posters, stickers and even t-shirts to put at our tables at conventions and to make available through our  (hopefully) upcoming website. All in all, it will cost us about $200 to get what we need for our first convention.
Web:
This brings us to the idea that we need a dot com. In these times, it pays to have dedicated access to your products and services. We are looking to secure our domain name and start running a site where all fans and friends of the series can come to see what's cooking and what's coming up. We also want a place that we can call home. Facebook has been great, but it would be so much nicer to be able to have the functionality that we need and not just base our marketing around whatever is available at the moment. This will cost us about $300
 Travel Expenses:
With this new expansion, we have accrued a new financial burden. It's one that we gladly bear, but one we could definitely use help with. We have been fortunate to have made enough money to be able to cover the initial costs of entrance to the two conventions we are booked for so far. But now there's the costs of hotel rooms and food and travel costs for three guys and a ton of gear. This cost is tough to put a solid figure on but it's one that we hope will continue. We love doing conventions and are super-excited about finally hitting them with our own project.
 The Impact: Here is Project Rec in a nutshell. We are all fans of the comic book medium. We have collectively been reading comics much longer than the three of us care to disclose. But be that as it may, we have all noticed a saddening trend in comics these days. There is no hope. Comics have become very dark. And while we acknowledge that entertainment media changes with the times, we also know that the ""real world"" is dark enough. So even though our stories start out dark, there is always hope at the end. There is always a redemptive theme. That's our purpose for getting into comics...we want the world to know that no matter how black the night, the morning always comes.    Risks & Challenges  Here are the major challenges we have hit so far:
- Creating a social media presence.
     - We are currently on Facebook, Twitter, Scope, Instagram, Tumblr, Google+ and LinkedIn and our following is growing every day.
     - We recently hit 15,000 views on Scope
     - We are just shy of 800 followers on Twitter
     - We are currently building our Tumblr and Instagram presence through art posts
     - We also joined the Indie Power Alliance, created by the team at New Worlds Comics and it provides a platform for indies and self-publishers to get their work out to a broad audience through cross-marketing with other indies along several  social media platforms.
     - We also received our first outside review this year and issues #0 and #1 were met with a solid review by geek-centric indie blogger, Savannah Baldwin of The Repressed Geek blog. Here's the link: http://therepressedgeek.com/?p=718
Increasing our reach:
     - We are currently working with a small indie publisher in Mexico City to get Reclamation translated into Spanish and to build up a fan base in Mexico, Moka B. Luna Perez and her friends at Collective Triforce have been assisting us with grass-roots, social media marketing in Mexico City and they are awesome!
     - We will also be releasing the Spanish version here in the states as well.
     - We also partnered with our local public library this year to host panels throughout the summer for kids to teach them how to create and make comic books. We were approached by a local comic store owner and told about the idea and we were happy and honored to be asked to be involved. We are truly looking forward to that experience.
Shipping Costs:
     - Apart from printing costs, shipping has been the other major expense.
     - Last year, we shipped comics and posters to Hungary, South Korea, Germany, Mexico, Honduras, England, Canada and Australia. We have shipped some to Argentina this year as well. So as you can see, Reclamation is quickly becoming international!
     - To surmount the costs of shipping internationally (since we have no intention of stopping), we have partnered with our local post office and have worked out shipping rates that are much more wallet-friendly and still guarantee safe, timely deliveries to our international friends and fans.
Expanding The Brand:
     - Last year, we offered inly Reclamation. But there were so many talented people working with us that we couldn't leave it at that. This year in June, we are releasing a one-shot book called Trinity. It will feature three short stories from Reclamation, Axios!, and Isaac & Ishtar.
     - Axios! - written by Travis Huber, Ryan Snelling and Phillip Wilson, with art by Matthew Walker is told from the perspective of demons sent to Earth to hone their skills. It chronicles the way they infect and torment souls in often subtle ways. It shows how demonic presences can come from anywhere, even disguising themselves as beings of light and good. It shows the ways that people can get twisted around by their wiles. But it also shows that there is hope for freedom from their oppression.
     - Isaac & Ishtar - Written By Travis Huber, with art by Tressina Bowling is a story about a soldier who dies in a desert conflict. But before his soul can cross over, he is confronted with a choice by an ancient spirit. Ishtar offers to return Isaac to life. But in return, he must offer his body to be her vessel so that she may once again walk among the living. Not wanting to die, he agrees. She enters him and he is resurrected. But all is not well. When Ishtar becomes bored with the mortal coil, she spices things up by fully taking over Isaac's body and wreaking havoc on the world of men. But once she releases her hold on Isaac after her tantrums, he is left with no memory of what happened, other than the devastation he now sees in front of him. 
     - Keeper of Secrets - A title currently in the works. But we're not giving you any details for this one. Let's just say that it continues where the events of the Reclamation series end after issue 12. We promise it's going to be something very cool and this project is very near and dear to all involved.
 
As you can see, we have gotten very accustomed to adversity and challenges. But no matter what, we are committed to getting our stories out there. We stay in communication with other indie publishers all over and collaborate with them on marketing strategies and ways to get our books out to the masses and garner help from wherever we can. It has been a long road, four years in fact since the beginning...but we are not giving up and we are most definitely not going away!    Other Ways You Can Help If you can't help us out with money, we will never turn down a soul wanting to assist us on this incredible journey! In addition to monetary support, we need help with getting our name out there. A few minutes of your time a couple of days a week and posting our stuff out through your social media pages is always welcomed. Also, word of mouth is a powerful advertisement. In fact, if it hadn't been for the lip service of our friends, families and fans we would've never gotten this far! So please, even if you can't contribute funding, your time is equally as valuable!",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns
