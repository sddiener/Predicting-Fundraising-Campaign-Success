I am a writer. I am a reader. I am an indoor gardener, a chicken keeper, a singer, a dancer, an advocate, an ally.</p><p>I want to invite you into the idea of SHIFT.  For me, the idea of SHIFT has been in the works for a long time.  There is so much I would like to share with you about it but let us start with the basics.</p><p>In Name:  <u>S</u>een and <u>H</u>eard <u>I</u>ndividual and <u>F</u>amily <u>T</u>herapy = SHIFT</p><p>SHIFT is both a physical concept and process.</p><p>Let us start with physical. SHIFT is a mobile office unit, think refurbished shuttle bus, equipped with all the things to support an individual as they shift.</p><p>SHIFT</p><p><i>Verb:</i> move or cause to move from one place to another, especially over a small distance.</p><p><i>Noun; </i>a slight change in position, direction, or tendency.</p><p>As for the process, SHIFT is slight changes towards wellness, towards healing, towards personal goal setting and achievement.  </p><p>Shift your mind: mental health counseling/life-coaching</p><p>Shift your body: yoga, mindfulness, meditation</p><p>Shift your environment: household organization, routine development, lifestyle consultation</p><p>Research continues to demonstrate the connection between the body, mind, and environment. My approach to therapy includes an integration of these three.  These shifts occur when individuals feel SEEN and HEARD.  When the environment is safe, predictable, and the relationship is a trusting one.  When the process is accessible and culturally appropriate.</p><p>Currently, my work involves loading into my family car and trekking all over Northern Minnesota.  I pack in all the playdough, dry erase boards, worksheets, yoga mats, fidgets, sensory items, sand tray, and play therapy items my car will hold.  Off I go.</p><p>Before Covid (BC) I would arrive at a school and cross my finger we could set up in a small office or empty classroom.   More often my client and I would end up meeting in an athletic trainers office, the back of the storage closet with gallons of paint, tubs of glue sticks, and crafty pom-poms, at a table in the library for all curious eyes to see, or worst of all—the principles office. </p><p>I thought that was difficult, but therapy now means meeting at school is basically off the table.  Instead, I roll up to the homes of my clients.  The homes where typically families, and extended families are hunkered down together with little to no privacy available.  I meet with my clients in the yard, on a blanket.  At least I did… but now, when the temperatures drop and snow begins to fly the yard isn’t an option.   Telehealth has been a lifesaver (literally) for some in this changing world, but for Deaf or Hard of Hearing client, there are often additional barriers using telehealth- no internet, no device, no privacy, no structure at home, limited language; to name a few.</p><p>By contributing to this campaign, you will be key in providing a safe, private, consistent space in which to create a therapeutic container.  You will be foundational in providing a resource to those in rural and urban communities alike.  Your contributions will break down many of the common barriers that exist in the pursuit of mental health and wellness. SHIFT will be able to reach those who might otherwise go without support or without support accessible to their language needs. Your contributions will allow me to take my unique skills and education in sign language, Deaf culture, trauma, trauma- informed yoga, and early childhood intervention further and support wellness across the state.</p><p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p><p>The goal for this campaign is $15,000.  Most of that amount would go to the purchase of the vehicle and interior transformation to mobile office.  The remainder of money raised will be used to hire skilled graphic design work for the exterior office impact and general SHIFT brand development.  Remaining funds will be invested into the development of SHIFT in terms of intervention materials, marketing, and ongoing vehicle maintenance.</p><p>What’s in it for you?  Well, support of this fundraising campaign comes with the automatic and renewable resource of internal feel goods; knowing you have contributed to a cause that will bring mental health and wellness to people who might otherwise not have access.  Every time you see this sweet ride roll past, or watch the transformation story on your social media feed, you’ll be able to say “I helped make that!”.   </p><p>Beyond the warm fuzzies and pride of investing in community wellness, a variety of perks are available with new perks being offered all the time. </p><p>The perks may include swag bundles, art created by local Duluth artists, SHIFT your Mind  sessions., SHIFT your Body yoga sessions, SHIFT your Environment consultations, yoga class passes, a SHIFT yoga retreat, and more!  New perks are being added often! </p><p>My promise is to honor your investment equitably in my appreciation and reciprocation.  Keep checking back for perk updates! </p><p><strong>The Impact</strong></p><p>Below are some mental health statistics.   I choose to share these because mental health is a problem everywhere and it cannot remain a secret.   The bolded statistics reflect <i>youth </i>and are bolded for two reason. First, youth are the primary population I work with, so these numbers are personally important. Second, kids with untreated mental health issues become adults with untreated mental health issues.  Those issues impact their ability to be the best versions of themselves, and all the parts of living and leading a life that come after. The italicized statistics are specific to <i><strong>Deaf and Hard of Hearing youth</strong>—</i>an even more narrow and underserved population, those I’ve spent nearly 20 years training to serve and support towards mental health and wellness. (I could also, and tend to go on and on and on about Deaf mental health, so I tried to keep it brief-ish).</p><ul>
<li>
<i>Youth mental health is worsening. 9.7% of youth in the U.S. have severe major depression, compared to 9.2% in last year’s dataset. This rate was highest among youth who identify as more than one race, at 12.4%.</i><strong> </strong>(<a href=""http://www.mhanational.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.mhanational.org</a>)</li>
<li>Even before COVID-19, the prevalence of mental illness among adults was increasing. In 2017-2018, 19% of adults experienced a mental illness, an increase of 1.5 million people over last year’s dataset. (<a href=""http://www.mhanational.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.mhanational.org</a>)</li>
<li><strong><i>Deaf children are more vulnerable than hearing children to neglect and emotional, physical, and sexual abuse. 50% of deaf girls has been sexually abused as compared to 25% of hearing girls. 54% of deaf boys have been sexually abused as compared to 10% of hearing boys. (Schwenke, 2011)</i></strong></li>
<li>Suicidal ideation among adults is increasing. The percentage of adults in the U.S. who are experiencing serious thoughts of suicide increased 0.15% from 2016-2017 to 2017-2018 – an additional 460,000 people from last year’s dataset. (<a href=""http://www.mhanational.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.mhanational.org</a>)</li>
<li>
<i>There is still unmet need for mental health treatment among youth and adults. 60% of youth with major depression did not receive any mental health treatment in 2017-2018. Even in states with the greatest access, over 38% are not receiving the mental health services they need. Among youth with severe depression, only 27.3% received consistent treatment. 23.6% of adults with a mental illness reported an unmet need for treatment in 2017-2018. This number has not declined since 2011. </i>(<a href=""http://www.mhanational.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.mhanational.org</a>)</li>
<li><strong><i>The existence of one – time-sensitive – language acquisition window means a strong possibility of permanent brain changes when spoken language is not fully accessible to the deaf child and sign language exposure is delayed, as is often standard practice. (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</a>)</i></strong></li>
<li>
<i>Young people are struggling most with their mental health.  Not only are the number of youth searching for help with their mental health increasing, but throughout the COVID-19 pandemic youth ages 11-17 have been more likely than any other age group to score for moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety and depression. </i>(<a href=""http://www.mhanational.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.mhanational.org</a>)</li>
<li>
<i>Rates of suicidal ideation are highest among youth, especially LGBTQ+ youth. In September 2020, over half of 11-17-year-olds reported having thoughts of suicide or self-harm more than half or nearly every day of the previous two weeks. From January to September 2020, 77,470 youth reported experiencing frequent suicidal ideation, including 27,980 LGBTQ+ youth. </i>(<a href=""http://www.mhanational.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.mhanational.org</a>)</li>
<li><strong><i>Language deprivation can cause cognitive delays and mental health difficulties across the lifespan. Mental health clinicians often see language deprivation and language dysfluency being a common “symptom” in deaf individuals who seek treatment, and are subsequently admitted to inpatient hospitals </i><i>(<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5392137/#R7"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Black &amp; Glickman, 2006</a>).</i><i> For some of these deaf patients, language deprivation is so severe that it may be its own mental health disorder – a “language deprivation syndrome</i><i>” (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5392137/#R15"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Glickman, 2007</a>, <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5392137/#R16"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">2009</a>; <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5392137/#R17"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Gulati, 2003</a>, <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5392137/#R18"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">2014</a>; <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5392137/#R20"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">W.

</ul><ul>
<li><strong><i>Prevalence of mental health issues appears to be proportionally elevated in the deaf population, along with a lower quality of life </i><i>(<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5392137/#R12"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fellinger et al., 2005</a>; <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5392137/#R13"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fellinger, Holzinger, &amp; Pollard, 2012</a>)</i><i>. Higher rates of interpersonal trauma are also a concern as are distinct traumas unique to being a deaf child raised in a hearing </i><i>world (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5392137/#R3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Anderson &amp; Leigh, 2011</a>; <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5392137/#R4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Anderson, Wolf Craig, Hall, &amp; Ziedonis, 2016</a></i><i> Additionally, one study of deaf college students demonstrated higher rates of child maltreatment, lifetime trauma, and post-traumatic stress symptoms compared to their hearing peers </i><i>(<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5392137/#R43"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Schenkel et al., 2014</a>). </i><i>(<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</a>)</i></strong></li>
<li>People screening at risk for mental health conditions are struggling most with loneliness or isolation. From April to September 2020, among people who screened with moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety or depression, 70 percent reported that one of the top three things contributing to their mental health concerns was loneliness or isolation. (<a href=""http://www.mhanational.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.mhanational.org</a>)</li>
</ul><p>SHIFT will be a unique, one of a kind source for those in need, with the unique bonus of being able to reach those individuals where they are; overcoming many of the current barriers.  The statistics above mentioned language deprivation, an incredibly important topic, I cannot go into detail about here.  If you’d like to have a better understanding I highly recommend this <a href=""https://youtu.be/cUTymzn5FEc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">brief video</a>.</p><p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p><p>With any new venture there are risks, and this is no different.</p><p>What if you don’t raise all the money?  </p><p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">I’ve seen incredible things happen when community pulls together for the greater good and I don’t think this will be any different. However, if not all the money is raised, that which IS raised will still go towards the purchase of a vehicle.  What comes after will simply take more time, creativity, and a bit more DIY.</p><p>What about the competition?</p><p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">In the current landscape, the competition for mental health and wellness occur in mainly two ways: telehealth and brick and mortar buildings.   Neither of those are much competition to services that can arrive at your doorstep, offering face to face connection.</p><p>What about Covid?</p><p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">Covid is one of the primary reasons that NOW seems like the right time for this model.  Mental health risks rise while access declines.  SHIFT will be a controlled environment ensuring those who enter are not demonstrating symptoms. Safety measures such as keeping 6ft and wearing masks will be followed.  The access to intervention items and office space itself can be controlled allowing for proper cleaning between clients.   And best yet, when the weather allows; many of the services can be provided outdoors, soaking up the healing sunshine and fresh air.</p><p>These risks do not worry me.  I am a believer in the best outcomes. That we all do better when we all do better.  Adaptability has been a foundational component in my professional life thus far, I do not think SHIFT will be any different.</p><p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p><p>If you cannot contribute in terms of money to this campaign; I understand, and I thank you for your support by reading this far!   Even if you are not able to donate at this time you can still make an impact on this campaign.  Please share this opportunity with your friends, family, and professional networks.  The more people that see and read about SHIFT the more likely rubber will meet the road.</p><p>Thank you for reading. </p><p>Thank you for you support.</p><p> </p><p>~Karen Sheldon</p></div>","I am Karen Sheldon, a mental health therapist, serving Deaf and Hard of Hearing youth, trauma informed yoga teacher, sign language interpreter, mother, wife, daughter, sister, friend.

Your contributions will allow me to take my unique skills and education in sign language, Deaf culture, trauma, trauma- informed yoga, and early childhood intervention further and support wellness across the state.What I Need & What You GetThe goal for this campaign is $15,000.  Most of that amount would go to the purchase of the vehicle and interior transformation to mobile office.  The remainder of money raised will be used to hire skilled graphic design work for the exterior office impact and general SHIFT brand development.  Remaining funds will be invested into the development of SHIFT in terms of intervention materials, marketing, and ongoing vehicle maintenance.What’s in it for you?  Well, support of this fundraising campaign comes with the automatic and renewable resource of internal feel goods; knowing you have contributed to a cause that will bring mental health and wellness to people who might otherwise not have access.  Every time you see this sweet ride roll past, or watch the transformation story on your social media feed, you’ll be able to say “I helped make that!”.   Beyond the warm fuzzies and pride of investing in community wellness, a variety of perks are available with new perks being offered all the time. The perks may include swag bundles, art created by local Duluth artists, SHIFT your Mind  sessions., SHIFT your Body yoga sessions, SHIFT your Environment consultations, yoga class passes, a SHIFT yoga retreat, and more!  New perks are being added often! My promise is to honor your investment equitably in my appreciation and reciprocation.  Keep checking back for perk updates! The ImpactBelow are some mental health statistics.   I choose to share these because mental health is a problem everywhere and it cannot remain a secret.   The bolded statistics reflect youth and are bolded for two reason. First, youth are the primary population I work with, so these numbers are personally important. Second, kids with untreated mental health issues become adults with untreated mental health issues.  Those issues impact their ability to be the best versions of themselves, and all the parts of living and leading a life that come after. The italicized statistics are specific to Deaf and Hard of Hearing youth—an even more narrow and underserved population, those I’ve spent nearly 20 years training to serve and support towards mental health and wellness. (I could also, and tend to go on and on and on about Deaf mental health, so I tried to keep it brief-ish).

Youth mental health is worsening. 9.7% of youth in the U.S. have severe major depression, compared to 9.2% in last year’s dataset. This rate was highest among youth who identify as more than one race, at 12.4%. (www.mhanational.org)
Even before COVID-19, the prevalence of mental illness among adults was increasing. In 2017-2018, 19% of adults experienced a mental illness, an increase of 1.5 million people over last year’s dataset. (www.mhanational.org)
Deaf children are more vulnerable than hearing children to neglect and emotional, physical, and sexual abuse. 50% of deaf girls has been sexually abused as compared to 25% of hearing girls. 54% of deaf boys have been sexually abused as compared to 10% of hearing boys. (Schwenke, 2011)
Suicidal ideation among adults is increasing. The percentage of adults in the U.S. who are experiencing serious thoughts of suicide increased 0.15% from 2016-2017 to 2017-2018 – an additional 460,000 people from last year’s dataset. (www.mhanational.org)

There is still unmet need for mental health treatment among youth and adults. 60% of youth with major depression did not receive any mental health treatment in 2017-2018. Even in states with the greatest access, over 38% are not receiving the mental health services they need. Among youth with severe depression, only 27.3% received consistent treatment. 23.6% of adults with a mental illness reported an unmet need for treatment in 2017-2018. This number has not declined since 2011. (www.mhanational.org)
The existence of one – time-sensitive – language acquisition window means a strong possibility of permanent brain changes when spoken language is not fully accessible to the deaf child and sign language exposure is delayed, as is often standard practice. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)

Young people are struggling most with their mental health.  Not only are the number of youth searching for help with their mental health increasing, but throughout the COVID-19 pandemic youth ages 11-17 have been more likely than any other age group to score for moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety and depression. (www.mhanational.org)

Rates of suicidal ideation are highest among youth, especially LGBTQ+ youth. In September 2020, over half of 11-17-year-olds reported having thoughts of suicide or self-harm more than half or nearly every day of the previous two weeks. From January to September 2020, 77,470 youth reported experiencing frequent suicidal ideation, including 27,980 LGBTQ+ youth. (www.mhanational.org)
Language deprivation can cause cognitive delays and mental health difficulties across the lifespan. Mental health clinicians often see language deprivation and language dysfluency being a common “symptom” in deaf individuals who seek treatment, and are subsequently admitted to inpatient hospitals (Black & Glickman, 2006). For some of these deaf patients, language deprivation is so severe that it may be its own mental health disorder – a “language deprivation syndrome” (Glickman, 2007, 2009; Gulati, 2003, 2014; W. C. Hall, Levin, & Anderson, in press; Humphries et al., 2016b). (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)

Prevalence of mental health issues appears to be proportionally elevated in the deaf population, along with a lower quality of life (Fellinger et al., 2005; Fellinger, Holzinger, & Pollard, 2012). Higher rates of interpersonal trauma are also a concern as are distinct traumas unique to being a deaf child raised in a hearing world (Anderson & Leigh, 2011; Anderson, Wolf Craig, Hall, & Ziedonis, 2016 Additionally, one study of deaf college students demonstrated higher rates of child maltreatment, lifetime trauma, and post-traumatic stress symptoms compared to their hearing peers (Schenkel et al., 2014). (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)
People screening at risk for mental health conditions are struggling most with loneliness or isolation. From April to September 2020, among people who screened with moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety or depression, 70 percent reported that one of the top three things contributing to their mental health concerns was loneliness or isolation. (www.mhanational.org)
SHIFT will be a unique, one of a kind source for those in need, with the unique bonus of being able to reach those individuals where they are; overcoming many of the current barriers.  The statistics above mentioned language deprivation, an incredibly important topic, I cannot go into detail about here.  If you’d like to have a better understanding I highly recommend this brief video.Risks & ChallengesWith any new venture there are risks, and this is no different.What if you don’t raise all the money?  I’ve seen incredible things happen when community pulls together for the greater good and I don’t think this will be any different. However, if not all the money is raised, that which IS raised will still go towards the purchase of a vehicle.  What comes after will simply take more time, creativity, and a bit more DIY.What about the competition?In the current landscape, the competition for mental health and wellness occur in mainly two ways: telehealth and brick and mortar buildings.   Neither of those are much competition to services that can arrive at your doorstep, offering face to face connection.What about Covid?Covid is one of the primary reasons that NOW seems like the right time for this model.  Mental health risks rise while access declines.  SHIFT will be a controlled environment ensuring those who enter are not demonstrating symptoms. Safety measures such as keeping 6ft and wearing masks will be followed.  The access to intervention items and office space itself can be controlled allowing for proper cleaning between clients.   And best yet, when the weather allows; many of the services can be provided outdoors, soaking up the healing sunshine and fresh air.These risks do not worry me.  I am a believer in the best outcomes. That we all do better when we all do better.  Adaptability has been a foundational component in my professional life thus far, I do not think SHIFT will be any different.Other Ways You Can HelpIf you cannot contribute in terms of money to this campaign; I understand, and I thank you for your support by reading this far!   Even if you are not able to donate at this time you can still make an impact on this campaign.  Please share this opportunity with your friends, family, and professional networks.  The more people that see and read about SHIFT the more likely rubber will meet the road.Thank you for reading. Thank you for you support. ~Karen Sheldon",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Hi! </h3>
<p>My name is Haley. I am a mountain mama in Golden, BC. I have been practicing yoga for 10 years and recently became a certified instructor. Our 200 hour program was SO amazing for me in so many ways. I already knew the benefits, and the power that yoga has to create a balanced, and happy life - but going deeper into my practice made me realize just how important a daily practice is. </p>
<p>When I started my teacher training, I didn't even think that I wanted to teach. I really just wanted to dive further into my practice. However, throughout my training I realized that I needed to share this knowledge! And who better to share it with than our kids?! </p>
<p>I want to teach children how amazing it feels to FILL our lungs to the fullest - to be KIND to one another and to MOVE our bodies in a gentle, non-competitive way. I decided that an after school program is just what we need! My goal is to help the children in our community get grounded after a long day of school by discussing mindfulness, healthy eating, crafting and YOGA!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<p>I am trying to raise money to get this program off the ground! As a stay at home mom, I just simply do not have the resources to buy the equipment I would like to have to run this program. </p>
<p>The money that I raise will be purchasing new mats &amp; yoga props as well as paying for a security deposit for the building that I hope to run this program out of. It will also help to fund some additional, kid-specific yoga training so that I have as many tools in my belt as possible to make sure that your kids have the best time possible! </p>
<p>Based on my research I will need $1500 maximum to get started. That means I will have everything I need to comfortable run this program - right down to craft supplies and smoothie ingredients!</p>
<p>I am not the type of person to ask for help financially when it comes to my own dreams &amp; goals - so this is completely out of my comfort zone. But - when I have talked to parents in town about what I plan to offer, everyone seems so excited and agrees that an after school yoga program is something that is missing from what our town has to offer. This campaign is going to help lock down my ideas and get the ball rolling!</p>
<p>I LOVE hanging out with kids - the more the merrier! It seems like there are always at least 5 kids at my house at all times and it fills my bucket to know that children feel happy being in our home. During the winter season, I work at the daycare at our local ski hill. Being able to spend time on the mountain with all of those little ski bums is my favourite part of winter! Aside from yoga, crafting is one of my most favourite past times! This will most definitely be a part of our program!</p>
<p>It is A-OK if we don't reach our entire goal! I will still use whatever funding we manage to receive towards the equipment needed to start up our after school program. The program might just have to launch a little later than I had hoped for - and that is okay! It just needs to happen!</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<p>Because I am so passionate about the importance of teaching yoga to children, I don't need to make a profit. I just want to be able to own my own equipment, share my love of yoga and offer something special to our wonderful community. </p>
<p>If you are interested in donating, every $40 that you donate will ensure that your child has a spot in one of our 4-week programs. That breaks down to $10 per session and less than $5 an hour!</p>
<p>If you are unable to contribute financially - that is fine, too! I totally get it! You can help by spreading the word - or maybe you have a great idea that you think would be a beneficial addition to Ahimsa Kids!</p>

Last year was our first trip to Greece, and we totally fell in love with the beaches, the wine, the winding blue and white towns, and the amazing people we met.<br/><br/>​The only problem was finding a great outdoor workout. Yoga retreats were 2 weeks long. Gyms were inside. And running along rocky cliffs and rural roads sounded... unwise. So we got inspired! And came up with Sweat Vacay. And here we are a year and half of work later, almost ready to launch!</p>
<p><br/>This launch is our first global venture together, and we can't wait to bring group-style fitness to the hottest vacay locales all over the world. We're so excited to be launching in May in Mykonos. Building this company has been the best experience of our lives.<br/> </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Together we have contributed about 30k to our venture and have take 3 research trips to Greece to secure partners and vendors, and to interview instructors for our Sweat Vacay team. We have locked down and started work with our legal teams in both US &amp; Greece. Lauren is now working full time on Sweat Vacay. And we're proud to say we've established an amazing Greek community that wants us to succeed :D</p> <p>In addition to our formal friends &amp; family investment round*, we are setting a goal to raise $25,000. With your help, we will be able to pay some of our American and Greek legal fees and buy the necessary equipment to get started - like yoga mats and spin bikes.<br/><br/>By contributing to our crowd-sourced raise, you get:<br/>•$25: Sweat Vacay sticker &amp; thank you mention on our website<br/>•$40: Sweat Vacay tee or tank<br/>•$50: one class of your choice<br/>•$75: two classes of your choice<br/>•$75: one class and one Sweat Vacay tee or tank<br/>•$100: Sweat Vacay tee or tank and yoga mat<br/>•$150: two classes and two Sweat Vacay tees or tanks<br/>•$500: two classes, two Sweat Vacay tees or tanks, two beach beds at luxury beach bar + a bottle of local wine<br/>•$500: local Mykonos gift basket including two Sweat Vacay tees or tanks</p>

<p>Chinese tea is the perfect balance of the extremely complex and the extremely simple. One can dive endlessly into the nuisances of tea making such as terroir, making style, and age of the tree. Just as a wine connoisseur thinks about the age of the grape vine, a tea connoisseur can differentiate the flavor of a hundred years old Pu-Er tree from that of a three hundred years old.

<p>My passion for tea started about five years ago when I started working in a tea shop in SoHo. Since then I have worked in various tea shops, sampled hundreds of varieties of teas, slowly learning and refining my palate. I find the taste of Chinese teas to be the most complex and invigorating and have focused much of my energy there. My focus on Chinese teas has allowed me to attain an insight about their various styles. This study is important to me because it allows me to understand something that is universally significant all over the world, and that is flavor. Understanding how a flavor is produce is an understanding of science and art. It is the study of scientific factors  that  went into the create of this flavor, such as terroir, and also how did the artistic way in which the tea maker manipulate these factors to produce the flavor. To further my education on tea, I will be traveling for an extended period of time in China to learn from the tea farmers and to harvest with them. When I return to the States I wish to share my knowledge and skill with others who can benefit from Chinese tea practice.</p> <p>This Spring, I will visit the most prominent tea provinces in China. I will be traveling to famous tea terroirs in order to learn from the farmers and to buy tea directly from the source. I will travel to the three most famous tea regions: Dong Ting mountain, Feng Huang Shan, and the Wuyi. Wuyi Shan and Feng Huang Shan produce two different types of wulongs that are loved by tea drinkers all over the world. Dong Ting is home to the famous green tea Bi Luo Chun. I have been given the rare opportunity to explore the tea farm in these locations.</p>
<p>I will spend months in each location to fully immerse myself in the regional tea that is grown. I will be working in the tea fields alongside the farmers. I will be documenting my entire trip via video, audio, and notes so that others can experience my journey as I am living them. The funds that I raise in the Indiegogo will support my research time in China. The time I am able to spend there, the more information I am able to gather and publish on <a href=""http://www.thesweetestdew.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Sweetest Dew</a>.</p> <p>My mission to educate people in Chinese tea has already started. Every month I hold a free public tea session in NYC where I introduce and brew tea for people to sample. I brew in the traditional Chinese style called, Gong Fu Cha—which brings out the best flavors of the leaves. Guests will enjoy the exquisite flavors of high quality tea, as well as the relaxing atmosphere of the tea parlor. With each guided session we try a variety of teas and discuss its properties and characteristics. These discussions allow people to foster a deeper understanding of flavors they might have otherwise missed. First timers will often come to me afterwards, surprised at how much they learned and enjoyed the whole experience. Not only do my sessions inspire people’s love of tea, it also brings them together. I plan on purchasing as much high-quality tea as I can from the farmers so that I can serve them in my guided teasessions. I will be hosting a session via Facebook Live so people outside of NYC can partake in my classes. The teas will also be made available for purchase online.</p>

This will include things like personal interview with the farmers, videos showing the full tea making process and pictures comparing the different types of tea leaves and plants. A well funded trip means I can extend my travel to other tea locations and build new relationships with farmers there. These farmers I will keep in contact with through out the year so they can answer any questions you have even after my trip is over.

Even more than important than understanding tea on a factual basis, is understanding the taste.

<p>A risk whenever you are buying tea is being sold unauthentic tea. It is common that tea sellers will try to tell you the tea they are selling you is something that is it not.

Tea sellers will often try to take a tea from another location and sell it as Wu Dong, thus charging a much higher price. I am prepared to handle this issue through working with farmers that I trust, coupled with my refined palate and knowledge of Chinese teas. Some of these farmers I have known for years, and I trust they will not try to trick me. I have also spent time specifically studying the flavors of Wuyi, Feng Huang, and Dong Ting teas, and have come to understand the flavors well enough to spot a fake. I know for example, that the liquid from a Wu Dong wulong has a weight to it that other locations do not have, or sign of a high quality Wuyi is a minerality on the teeth. This knowledge will allow me to buy authentic teas for a price that is reflective of their quality.</p>
<p>Investments into my trip of any size are appreciated. Even if you give $10, you have given me one night of lodging, which in turn could mean one more day in the tea region.

It is a unique archaeological site on the beautiful island of Sicily. Orazio and Silvana Bisazza (Paolo’s parents) have dedicated their life for the last 20 years to restoring the land. This has been no easy job, they have sacrificed a lot, and had to overcome many obstacles along the way. So much has been done but there is so much more to do. Orazio’s mother, Maria Cannuli, lived in this village before it was abandoned completely, and entrusted the villages’ preservation to her son Orazio before she passed. Orazio has always had a strong passion and commitment to Pantano. He is a true visionary and with immense patience and perseverance continues to work towards bringing this magical place back to life.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Their united intention is to share Pantano with those who feel drawn to the place; those who yearn for some inner restoration, expression and contemplation particularly through Meditation and Yoga. A space that is both accessible and inexpensive, where groups and individuals of all ages, from all walks of life and from all lands have the opportunity to experience this unique place.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><u>The history of Pantano</u></strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""text-align: center;"">Borgo Pantano is located in the town of Rometta in the province of Messina, Sicily. It is a splendid example of rural archaeology, which rises in the Peloritani mountains about 220 meters above sea level and is spread over an area of ​​about 15 hectares. As you drive down into the village there is a clear view of the surrounding mountains as well as the ocean and Vulcano.  It has been an interesting journey of discovery for Paolo’s parents. They have researched, studied and learned many intriguing historical facts about Pantano, and yet there is still a profound mystical element to the place. The village dates back to 1200 and was most likely founded by a Jewish community that was dedicated to herbal medicine until 1500, when the inquisition in Sicily cancelled (apparently) all traces of Jewish communities. It’s highly possible that the medicinal herbs were grown for a local pharmacy. The building materials, the land, the countless wells spotted around the village all indicate a logical and sustainable irrigation system – all of which are being restored and maintained. Paolo’s parents have spent years cultivating the land, creating paths, roads, re-planting the traditional trees and plants and  preserving the traditional medicinal herbs and ancient flowers. There are groves of olive, lemon, orange, mandarin, pomegranate, almond, walnut and carob trees that bear delicious fruit throughout the year.</span></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><span style='text-align: center;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>  </span><span style=""text-align: center;"">At the heart of the village is the splendid Santa Maria Delle Grazie (Mother Mary) Church which dates back to the early 1400’s. It was thought to have been disguised as a Catholic church after 1500, as the architecture shows strong signs of being a Jewish Synagogue. Regardless of its precise religious origins, this spiritual hub has clearly enriched the energy of the land. There is a distinct sense of peace, silence and serenity that pervades the place and visitor’s hearts. The rare statue of the Mother Mary breastfeeding, not only represents the human and individual but also the symbolic and universal. Mother is an energy, a principle, and embodies the Universal or the Great Divine Mother as the giver of life, of wisdom, the carer, the nurturer, the intuitive and the creative fearless warrior. </span><span style=""text-align: center;""> </span></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""text-align: center;""><i>(The historical, cultural and agricultural details would fill books, this summary does not do the extent of research justice, do read more here: progettopantano.it or contact Paolo directly).</i></span></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><u>The Meditation Space: Domus Domini</u></strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">In Pantano there are many houses, a few have been partially restored, but are not yet habitable. All the materials used to restore the land and the houses are sustainable and reflect the original historical structure of the place.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">The building, Domus Domini was selected for its secluded location in the village and the dimensions of the building are ideal as a workshop space for holistic disciplines. Interestingly, this building was originally a convent managed by the nuns of S. Maria de Messana – so already this place has its own sacredness.

It is a unique archaeological site on the beautiful island of Sicily. Orazio and Silvana Bisazza (Paolo’s parents) have dedicated their life for the last 20 years to restoring the land. This has been no easy job, they have sacrificed a lot, and had to overcome many obstacles along the way. So much has been done but there is so much more to do. Orazio’s mother, Maria Cannuli, lived in this village before it was abandoned completely, and entrusted the villages’ preservation to her son Orazio before she passed. Orazio has always had a strong passion and commitment to Pantano. He is a true visionary and with immense patience and perseverance continues to work towards bringing this magical place back to life.Their united intention is to share Pantano with those who feel drawn to the place; those who yearn for some inner restoration, expression and contemplation particularly through Meditation and Yoga. A space that is both accessible and inexpensive, where groups and individuals of all ages, from all walks of life and from all lands have the opportunity to experience this unique place.The history of PantanoBorgo Pantano is located in the town of Rometta in the province of Messina, Sicily. It is a splendid example of rural archaeology, which rises in the Peloritani mountains about 220 meters above sea level and is spread over an area of ​​about 15 hectares. As you drive down into the village there is a clear view of the surrounding mountains as well as the ocean and Vulcano.  It has been an interesting journey of discovery for Paolo’s parents. They have researched, studied and learned many intriguing historical facts about Pantano, and yet there is still a profound mystical element to the place. The village dates back to 1200 and was most likely founded by a Jewish community that was dedicated to herbal medicine until 1500, when the inquisition in Sicily cancelled (apparently) all traces of Jewish communities. It’s highly possible that the medicinal herbs were grown for a local pharmacy. The building materials, the land, the countless wells spotted around the village all indicate a logical and sustainable irrigation system – all of which are being restored and maintained. Paolo’s parents have spent years cultivating the land, creating paths, roads, re-planting the traditional trees and plants and  preserving the traditional medicinal herbs and ancient flowers. There are groves of olive, lemon, orange, mandarin, pomegranate, almond, walnut and carob trees that bear delicious fruit throughout the year.  At the heart of the village is the splendid Santa Maria Delle Grazie (Mother Mary) Church which dates back to the early 1400’s. It was thought to have been disguised as a Catholic church after 1500, as the architecture shows strong signs of being a Jewish Synagogue. Regardless of its precise religious origins, this spiritual hub has clearly enriched the energy of the land. There is a distinct sense of peace, silence and serenity that pervades the place and visitor’s hearts. The rare statue of the Mother Mary breastfeeding, not only represents the human and individual but also the symbolic and universal. Mother is an energy, a principle, and embodies the Universal or the Great Divine Mother as the giver of life, of wisdom, the carer, the nurturer, the intuitive and the creative fearless warrior.  (The historical, cultural and agricultural details would fill books, this summary does not do the extent of research justice, do read more here: progettopantano.it or contact Paolo directly).The Meditation Space: Domus DominiIn Pantano there are many houses, a few have been partially restored, but are not yet habitable. All the materials used to restore the land and the houses are sustainable and reflect the original historical structure of the place.The building, Domus Domini was selected for its secluded location in the village and the dimensions of the building are ideal as a workshop space for holistic disciplines. Interestingly, this building was originally a convent managed by the nuns of S. Maria de Messana – so already this place has its own sacredness. This building was later abandoned and was used as part of a stable and a warehouse. The objective is to complete the restoration of this building, and to also create around it facilities for camping accommodation. This will provide the possibility for people to stay and to really connect to the land and the nature it offers, whilst enjoying diverse activities. The name Domus Domini was chosen for the building, it means The House (or dwelling place) of God!What has been done so far on Domus Domini?The majority of the work has been done on the building (see pictures), the original structure has been maintained and the traditional materials were used. There are three distinct chambers of the building. Two parts have mostly be completed. The third part, that was an ancient millstone, remains to be completed.

Dotted around the village there are two large pine prefabricated buildings, and seven ""pagghiari"" (typical local stone huts roofed with vegetable branches – which were typically used by farmers as temporary overnight shelters). What needs to be done?For the building: the floor needs to be laid with handcrafted Sicilian flooring, the interiors need to be restored, the electrical system and the water system and the chestnut wooden window fixtures for the doors and windows have to be completed. A cooking space in the Domus Domini must be built and equipped. The area needs to equipped with two more ecological toilets and showers, the area for camping needs to be levelled, hydraulic arrangements and rainwater channelling completed. To provide further accommodation the arrangement of a darkening systems plus folding beds and photovoltaic kits for night lighting of the seven ""pagghiari"" and two prefabricated pine buildings. Purchase of outdoor night lighting system for the campsite, as well as purchase of tents and related accessories, together with yoga mats and props.Activities/Workshops  The intention is to provide a space for activities, seminars and trainings that offer time for solitude, introspection and reflection as well as sharing, creativity, laughter and play. The activities will be open and available to all for daytime, weekend and longer stays. Other teachers or craftsmen are welcome to organise events and trainings. There will be numerous charity and community events, many events will be on a donation basis or those on low-income can be subsidised. There will be tailored classes for children, teenagers, families, women’s and men’s groups, and those enduring and recovering from illnesses; mental, physical and spiritual (which of course are all related!).             Here are just a few activities which will take place:
Mindfulness & Meditation Courses, Silent Retreats

<li>We are making cycling more accessible to new female riders</li>
<li>We are creating a sense of belonging for females riding in Alberta</li>
<li>We are empowering women to be part of a change to a male dominated sport</li>
</ul>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Other all female teams who have come before us and have not lasted more than a few years. Typically, this has been because sponsors had different views on the direction the team should go (ie not all female). Here's why we don't feel that will happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are not branding to a sponsor, we have created our own brand.</li>
<li>We will be doing events with women outside of our own team, the bigger the impact, the better the reason to support what we are doing.</li>

<h3>PrettySick Supply: Our Introduction</h3>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/p4BE9JnjcdI?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<h3>PrettySick Supply: Project Outreach</h3>
<p>We're 2 people who also have chronic conditions and disabilities.  SarahCate is a type 2 diabetic with anxiety, and a cancer survivor with chronic pain from treatment.  Kris has a compressed disc, hypertension, depression, and anxiety.  We both know the challenges of finding functional medical and mobility gear that reflects our unique personalities and styles.</p>
<p>The problem isn't the lack personalized equipment-- it's that much of it is modified or created by people who also have chronic conditions or disabilities.  Many of us can't afford to advertise our shops or products and must rely on word of mouth and... well... luck to be discovered by customers.  </p>
<p>As both consumers and creators we realized that more is needed to bridge that gap and make finding products and producers easier for our entire community. So in July of 2017, we created PrettySickSupply.com and became a hub for our community to search, find, and discover creators and shops offering all manner of items invaluable to the chronic illness/disability community.</p>
<p>Between advertising and aggressive sharing, we've managed to get the word out online- when you need new gear and you want it to reflect who you are- PrettySickSupply is the place to go.  But we want to do more than that- we want to connect creators with an even larger audience.  Our goal with this campaign is to take our hub and expand its reach offline as well.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<ul>
<li>We're looking to raise $6000 in funding, and that money will be used to pay existing advertising fees ($1500), create a future advertising budget ($1500), And most of the rest will be used for printing, mailing supplies and shipping of the finished rack cards, with a small portion being used to produce the rewards for backers.</li>
<li>Speaking of rewards- We have a great batch of rewards for generous backers.  Starting at only $1, you'll get shout outs, link-outs to the site/charity of your choice, great posters, jewelry, magnets and more!</li>
<li>If we don't meet the entire goal, we'll use what we do get to pay existing advertising fees, and do a smaller run of printing and mailing for the rack cards from home as opposed to having them run professionally.</li>
<li>All of this will allow us to reach directly out to a wider customer base than we can reach simply with Facebook advertising.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With so many people of all ages living with chronic illnesses, pain and disabilities, PrettySick Supply is a critical connection in our larger community.  Living with chronic conditions can be dehumanizing in so many ways- and one way to combat those feeling of depersonalization and sameness is to have accessories and equipment that reflect a person's personal style.  </p>
<p>In just 6 months since launching the site, it has received consistent hits in every product category.  We've seen over 15,000 hits since July of 2017- mostly from word of mouth and Facebook advertising.  Imagine the exposure we could give creators with a print campaign as well- in medical offices all over the US.</p>
<p>We've seen more than 4,000 unique visitors from 55 different countries, and while a lot of our resources are US based, we've found shops and creators shipping from and to locations all over the world!  These funds are critical to help us share our site and our mission with even more of our community.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Here's the truth: we've never done fundraising like this before.  But to be fair- we've never launched a major website before, or managed social media accounts for a business.  So far- we're not doing too badly- and a lot of what's stopping us is a lack of financial resources.  </p>
<p>With financing sorted out, our biggest challenge will be gathering the resources and addresses to SEND out all of our mailings.  But if there's one thing we do particularly well, it's research!  95% of the shops and resources we've listed on PrettySick Supply so far were found by one of our creators. </p>
<p>We'll be asking for input from our chronic illness/disability community for clinics and doctors who would be open to sharing our literature with their patients, and go from there.  And we're confident that once we've introduced ourselves- GPs and Specialists will be thrilled to share with their patients- after all, our own Doctors already are!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We know that our target community is not a rich one, and a lot of folks viewing this fundraiser will really want to help- but won't be able to financially.  Believe us, we'd rather not ask for money, but we can't take these next steps without it!  </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Can't contribute financially?  Share this page; show your friends and family.  Our rewards make GREAT gifts!  Ask your friends or family to donate and tell them the rewards are on your Christmas or Birthday list... it's a great way to get cool stuff and support a great cause.</p></li>
<li><p>Even with finances, we're still going to need a lot of help from word of mouth and community involvement.  Talk to your Doctor or Specialist about what we're doing- see if they'd be willing to share PSS as a resource for their patients!  If you know about a clinic, hospital, or other medical office that would be willing to add us to their literature rack- let us know!  We'll start compiling a list so that when fundraising is complete- we can get printing and mailing right away!</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>Our rewards span a range from a named thank you on our website, to a package including posters, magnets, link-outs, jewelry and more.</p>
<p>-For rewards levels including a choice of poster- see your options below.  There are 3 types of posters to choose from, with options in each from which you can choose!</p>
<ul><li><p>Spoonies Unite!: A call to action (or lack thereof) for the chronically ill, pained and disabled everywhere.  This tongue in cheek poster is available in 10 color options, select the option that includes your preference, and we'll contact you at dispersal time to verify which color you want shipped.</p></li></ul>

<p>-In addition, there's a reward level that includes a hand-made spoon pendant: bent, adorned and sealed by our very own SarahCate!  Designs vary, and pendants will be sent out on a first come first serve basis!  When fundraising is complete, backers who selected the spoon package will receive an email with images to allow them to choose which pendant they'd prefer.  Those who back at this level first will have first choice, second backer will have second choice and so on.  There are 31 designs to choose from in all!  </p>

<h2>People's Power House</h2>
<p><i>Self-Defense is for everyone!</i></p>
<h3>TL:DR Origin Story</h3>
<p>Hey! Thanks for checking out our fundraiser page. A little about us:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are a group of martial arts and wellness student and instructors that are super keen on opening a queer+ body + holsitic martial arts space that is financially accessible to both individuals and orgs</li>
<li>We're looking to raise some funds to start off our dream! The more $$$, the bigger the space we can get, and we're looking at this as a 5+ year project, so every penny counts (and every $100 counts too tho)</li>
<li>This would be an absolutely amazing resource for the community, and will make self-defense more accessible to folks who have historically been pushed out of athletic spaces, due to class, gender, size, sexuality, and ability.</li>
<li><p>We’ll offer a weekly schedule of classes that includes MMA, Boxing, Self-Defense, and Yoga.  We want this gym to be accessible to everyone regardless of how much money they have, which means we’re looking to lower cost of space access for students and up-and-coming organizations.</p></li>
</ul>

Self-Defense is for everyone!
TL:DR Origin Story
Hey! Thanks for checking out our fundraiser page. A little about us:

We are a group of martial arts and wellness student and instructors that are super keen on opening a queer+ body + holsitic martial arts space that is financially accessible to both individuals and orgs
We're looking to raise some funds to start off our dream! The more $$$, the bigger the space we can get, and we're looking at this as a 5+ year project, so every penny counts (and every $100 counts too tho)
This would be an absolutely amazing resource for the community, and will make self-defense more accessible to folks who have historically been pushed out of athletic spaces, due to class, gender, size, sexuality, and ability.
We’ll offer a weekly schedule of classes that includes MMA, Boxing, Self-Defense, and Yoga.  We want this gym to be accessible to everyone regardless of how much money they have, which means we’re looking to lower cost of space access for students and up-and-coming organizations.

If you like us so far, check out our donations tiers. If you're not convinced and need more info, keep reading!


What We Need & What You Get
Break it down for folks in more detail:

We're looking to raise about $20,000 to get this gym started for the first year. This budget would include
Rent/Utilities (6 months-12 months)
Equipment- pads and bags and mats oh my!
Insurance
Administrative Fees
Promotions- gettin the word out on social media
Build-Up- a.k.a making the space shine
Amenities/Facilities- cleanin and keepin the space nice, cause we deserve nice things)


For your donation WE WILL BE FOREVER IN DEBT. But also you can get one of our fancy custom t-shirts, wraps, gloves, and yoga mats! Plus some zines, stickers, and pins to boot!
Want MORE opportunities to donate? We got movie nights, trainings, comedy nights, and plenty of other fun things planned to celebrate the start of PPH. Stay tuned for updates for all the cool events we got coming up, and see the current list of events here.

We're gonna try super duper hard to reach this goal, but if we do not, don't worry! This project is a dream of ours, and it will come to life in some form (even if it means starting a bit smaller for a while)

Ce n'est pas une démarche facile pour moi mais je me lance et je veux montrer aussi qu'on peut tout demander, qu'on peut se lancer surtout quand on est passionnée et quand on croit à ses idées. Je suis aussi convaincue de l'envergure de ce projet et de ce que cela va créer ! Ça va être PUISSANT !! Je vais même le partager sur le réseau Access Consciousness worldwide ! qu'est ce que ça peut créer ? Ce qui m'amuse c'est vraiment de faire des trucs improbables et que personne n'oserait faire ! Aussi je reconnais que je sais que je suis un excellent « connecteur » (cf. la joie du business de Simone Milasas pour ceux ou celles qui ne connaissent pas) et ce projet va permettre de créer de très nombreuses connexions qui contribueront à tous ! Ma démarche peut sembler complètement folle pour certains...et je n'ai jamais dit que je ne l'étais pas (ahahah) et c'est ça qui est drôle ! ! C'est ça qui change le monde !Si vous choisissez de contribuer à ce projet, quelle magie est ce que ça va créer dans vos vies ? Alors d'avance, je vous remercie pour vos contributions ! Aussi  pour ceux qui ne m'accueillent pas pendant la tournée mais qui veulent contribuer à partir de 30 euros, vous pourrez bénéficier d'une mini facilitation en ligne avec moi sur le thème de votre choix ! et si votre contribution est égale ou supérieure à 70 euros, alors là vous aurez droit à une heure de facilitation en ligne ou à un processus corporel énergétique si nous pouvons nous rencontrer :) Merci aussi pour vos nombreuses invitations. Gratitude !! On va bien se marrer ! C'est garanti !!!!! Quelle magie et quelle joie est ce que je peux propager dans vos univers ?Si ce n'est pas déjà fait, suivez moi sur ma page facebook « paye ta magie avec Elodie » !!

<h3>When Raymond worked at Shuman Detention Center...</h3>
<p>He was introduced to yoga by a local yogi named Joanne Spence. She brought yoga to the youth there and relied on Raymond to help garner interest. She believed in the power of yoga to help transform mental and physical habits, and overall well being. Raymond was a tad skeptical at first, but he kept an open mind, and eventually started to see the changes in himself, and the residents in his care. </p>
<p>After talking about his experience with this program, and winning the annual JDCAP program of the year for juvenile detention, I jokingly suggested he start a movement and call it BIG GUY YOGA! We laughed about it at first, but then quickly realized that it was kind of a brilliant idea. </p>
<p>We knew he'd have to practice yoga more regularly and seek certification to teach yoga, and he had every intention of doing so. But life, paying the bills, transitioning jobs, health issues etc put his vision on a temporary hold...until now! </p>
<p>An opportunity has arisen for Raymond to take a 200 hour Yoga Instruction course  to become a certified yoga instructor with an organization called ""Breathe for Change."" Raymond will be taking the course this summer in Washington DC. We were hoping he could take the class sooner, but the summer class actually works much better with his schedule, and it gives us more time to raise/save the cost of tuition! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Raymond needs a total of $2500 to make this vision a reality. </p>
<ul>
<li>$2000 covers the remaining tuition &amp; fees. </li>
<li>$500 covers a fraction of his travel and lodging while in Washington DC. </li>
<li>Any funds raised over the goal amount will go toward travel expenses and lodging. </li>
</ul>
<p>We have provided ""perks"" for those who donate! $5 gets you a free yoga session, once Raymond is certified. $25 gets you 5 sessions, and $100 gets you 20 sessions that we encourage you to share with a friend! The sessions will be available after 1/18/17 at a location TBA. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We really believe this opportunity will jump start a movement that has great potential. To start, BIG GUY YOGA plans to partner with Northside organizations and start close to home! BIG GUY YOGA believes that yoga, as a practice, cultivates discernment, awareness, self-regulation and higher consciousness in the individual. According to Wikipedia, ""Yoga achieves overall health and wellbeing (physical, emotional, mental and social) through the regular practice of a range of many different techniques, including postures and movement, breath awareness and breathing exercises, relaxation and concentration, self-inquiry and meditation."" </p>
<p>Facilitating more opportunities for mindfulness is the primary goal of BIG GUY YOGA, and we hope you can help Raymond achieve this vision. </p>
<p>Breathing is very important. Change is very important. Breathing for Change just might be the healing balm that much of our interpersonal ills crave. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge we face is funding the required course work. Now that we are certain he will take the summer course, we can breathe a little easier, and are confident we'll meet our goal! </p>
<p>Can we count on you to help make this vision a reality? </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Sometimes, you just can't contribute $$$, but that doesn't mean you can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need you to let us know that we are on to something! If you like what you hear, and you have a group that might benefit from BIG GUY YOGA, let us know!</li>
<li>Shares=$$$$! When you share the BIG GUY YOGA campaign on social media, email, etc, you help increase our visibility and that means dollars and cents! </li>

<h3>Capri's Apothecary -</h3>
<p>Who I am and what it is.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hello angels, my name is Caesar or as many call me Capri. I'm a 21 year old black lesbian creative based out the West Coast. Most of my life I have been vegetarian, plant-based and sustainable/holistic. Well, what is sustainable and holistic? Sustainability is the practice of small waste lifestyle. To do your best in making sure everything you have gets used and one doesn't create extra trash etc. Holistic is natural living, so many people who live holistically tend to make their own medicine, body care items, household cleaning items etc etc. (Yes, I do this too.)</p>
<p>I started being sustainable and holistic pretty much right out of high school at 17 years old. It was important to me to get back to my roots, to get back to earth and show all my gratitude toward her. However, what people don't know about the holistic community is that it's saturated in whiteness and can be exclusionary for lower income, younger, black and brown folk. That's another part of my mission, to make this accessible to kids like me. I didn't have a lot of money at all when I started this and growing my essential oil collection has been a years long project. I want sustainable switches to be affordable and to make holistic/organic product affordable for people like me too.</p>
<p>Which leads me to this, Capri's. Capri's was born out of years long debate and a very fortunate accident. After posting a picture of my essential oil collection and people deciding I was worth it, I fully decided to open my shop. Focusing (right now) primarily on body care. Butters, oils and soaps. Each item is prayed over, charged and blessed. Either with prayer, crystals, the sun or the moon. There is a heavy spiritual influence and attachment to my products. </p>
<p>I'm making this indiegogo to ask for help and ask for a chance to grow. Funding this alone while also trying to make moves for my personal life can and has gotten difficult. I want to be able to expand. Into something even bigger than this, for the community. For my community, black lesbian girls and queer folk alike. </p>
<p>I sincerely hope you all will give me a chance. </p>
<p>Yours, Capri.</p>

Holistic Hilda, the host and producer of the Wise Traditions podcast, is convinced that the key to better health is found in the wisdom of our ancestors. The month-long ancestral health tour in Australia was prompted by a sense of urgency to share ancestral health principles, based on Dr. Weston A. Price's findings nearly 100 years ago, and to learn about traditional health habits that we can incorporate into our own lives wherever we live. Dr. Weston A. Price traveled all around the world in the 1930s and Hilda has begun following in his footsteps. She has traveled to Peru and Kenya. And she is continuing on this quest and is particularly excited about Australia since Dr. Price considered the indigenous people of Australia to represent the epitome of moral and physical perfection. Also, outside of the United States, Australia has the biggest listening audience of the Wise Traditions podcast. This indicates that there is great interest in ancestral health practices, which Hilda will promote throughout the country.The big picture of the itinerary is listed below. Aug 31 Fitzroy, VIC Indigenous food feast at Charcoal Lane restaurantSept 1 Castlemaine Bee Sanctuary, VIC Honey beehive tourSept 3 Abbotsford, VIC Meat Matters: how farm animals can save our health and planetSept 4 Sydney, NSW Wesley Centre CBD Wise Traditions, Wellness & WAPFSept 5 Sydney, Woollahra Development of children through nutrient-dense foodsSept 5 Sydney, Castle Hill A New Hope for Food Degradation & Modern EpidemicsSept 7 Sydney, Redfern WAPF member discussion at CarriageWorks marketsSept 12 Tweed Shire, Clunes Community, environment & healing.

Three sponsors have stepped up $8000 more is needed to cover in-country food, lodging, and the hiring of a local videographer/photographer to capture content for future release. I will save money by staying with local chapter leaders and friends in Australia! I'm not opposed to couch surfing, either. I am hiring videographers in Australia, so I don't have to incur unnecessary additional travel costs.Of course I'll cover plenty of expenses out of pocket. But I just can't pull off this project on my own! A friend in Australia actually was the one who came up with this idea to crowdfund the project. As you can imagine, gifts of any size are MUCH appreciated! This is a big undertaking and it truly cannot take place without significant support. Join hands with us to address the worldwide health crisis!

A life in balance, Inside & Outside! 


- Juice & Raw Food Bar

A cozy space where public can find a vegan and raw cuisine (without animal food and without being cooked), prepared to serve breakfast, brunches, lunches and dinners and a bar with a variety of juices, detox juices and smoothies.
We plan to serve a vibrant kitchen inspired by bistronomy, a new wave in cooking style born in Paris, offering high experimental cuisine at a reasonable price. The concept ""Bistro"", a Russian origin word meaning ""fast"", combined with the Spanish concept of ""tapas"" and Portuguese for ""petiscos"", inspired us to create very well executed, creative dishes with excellent products and simplified service. We want satisfied customers, at all levels!
Our target audience is not just the vegetarian or vegan, or the one who already enjoys healthy eating; We have created a targeted service for all those who enjoy quality food and creativity, at an affordable price, even if they are fast-food consumers.
Um espaço aconchegante onde o público pode encontrar uma cozinha vegetariana (sem comida animal e sem cozinhar), preparada para servir refeições e um bar com uma variedade de sumos e smoothies. Pretendemos servir uma cozinha vibrante inspirada na bistronomia, uma nova onda de estilo culinário nascida em Paris, oferecendo alta cozinha experimental a um preço razoável. O conceito ""Bistro"", uma palavra de origem russa que significa ""rápido"", combinado com o conceito espanhol de ""tapas"" e o português para ""petiscos"", nos inspirou a criar pratos criativos e bem executados com excelentes produtos e serviço simplificado. Queremos clientes satisfeitos, em todos os níveis!
O nosso público-alvo não é apenas vegetariano ou vegano, ou aquele que já gosta de comer saudável. Criamos um serviço direcionado para todos aqueles que gostam de alimentos e criatividade de qualidade, a um preço acessível, mesmo que sejam consumidores de fast food.

 

- Detox Programs and Consultations

A counseling service where a specialist advises an individual detox plan, adapted to the unique needs and characteristics of each one, consisting of food counseling, health professionals support, and detox juice, which we can prepare on the spot. A detox plan is essential these days. The stressful lifestyle, the polluted environment, the poor quality of food and the water we ingest, etc., leave waste, toxins in our body. This can lead to mental and physical symptoms.
Um serviço de aconselhamento para um plano de desintoxicação individual, adaptado às necessidades e características únicas de cada um, que podemos preparar no local. Um plano de desintoxicação é essencial hoje em dia. O estilo de vida estressante, o ambiente poluído, a má qualidade dos alimentos e a água que ingerimos, etc., deixam resíduos, toxinas no nosso corpo. Isso pode levar a sintomas mentais e físicos.

 

- Culture and Live Music

A cheerful place where, at the weekend, we’ll get in contact with new music talents, creating an artistic and cosmopolitan environment, where alcohol will have no place, but instead the small shots of stimulating juices will produce a healthier and more moisturizing effect. We will regularly hold talks and art exhibitions.
Um lugar alegre onde, no fim de semana, entraremos em contato com novos talentos musicais, criando um ambiente artístico e cosmopolita, onde o álcool não terá lugar, mas, em vez disso, os pequenos shots de sumos estimulantes produzirão um efeito mais saudável e mais hidratante . Realizaremos regularmente tertúlias e exposições de arte.

We have a strong pre-launch campaign response and fully expect to reach our target. If we do not, we will be able to rent a smaller store, less employees and less equipment.

We will also promote on our youtube channel, raw food recipes and natural health cares. 
RISCO MÍNIMO
Nós estamos fortemente empenhadas na abertura da nossa loja. Se não alcançarmos o nosso objectivo  nesta campanha, alugaremos uma loja menor, e com menos equipamentos. 
Em janeiro de 2018, lançaremos o site e-commerce, com vendas on-line com serviço de entrega em domicílio, o que permitirá uma melhor divulgação de nossos produtos e serviços. 
As oficinas e os retiros também serão promovidos num espaço alugado, para começarmos a espalhar consciência! 
Também promoveremos no nosso canal do Youtube, receitas de rawfood e cuidados de saúde naturais para uma maior divulgação.

 
The Impact
Health , sustainability, environment, awareness towards to the world, to us and to our relationships, are important values to us. We want to contribute to a balanced life based on our sharing about the world and in this world.
In the kitchen we’ll consciously seek to use local, organic and ethical products wherever possible, we’ll try to minimize waste, and it will be separated and recycled and we’ll develop relationships with our suppliers to support our environmental efforts. By reducing the consumption of products from other locations, we want to avoid the environmental costs of transport and storage, by reducing animal consumption, we reduce the significant environmental impact this industry represents and by using organic food wherever possible, we prevent the continued use of pesticides that harm our health, air and soil. 
O IMPACTO
Saúde, sustentabilidade, meio ambiente, conscienlização para o mundo, para nós e para nossos relacionamentos, são valores importantes para nós. Queremos contribuir para uma vida equilibrada baseada no nossa partilha sobre o mundo e neste mundo. 
Na cozinha, procuraremos usar produtos locais, orgânicos e éticos sempre que possível, tentaremos minimizar o desperdício e será separado e reciclado. Desenvolveremos relacionamentos com nossos fornecedores para que apoiem os nossos esforços ambientais. Ao reduzir o consumo de produtos de outros locais, queremos evitar os custos ambientais de transporte e armazenamento. Reduzindo o consumo de animais, reduzimos o impacto ambiental significativo que representa esta indústria e, sempre que possível, utilizamos alimentos orgânicos, evitamos o uso contínuo de pesticidas que prejudicam nossa saúde, ar e solo.
With love, Inside & Outside!

I struggled with those feelings most of my life, tried various things to hide and overcome them. I have travelled the world to explore and experience ways people deal with life.

I invite you to be a part of our little space in the urban city… to take a break from modern day life… to have a moment to zen out.<br/><br/>As a kid, I ran around my family's hotel business, grew up watching &amp; eventually involved in the many departments a hotel encompasses - from reception to housekeeping to restaurants to shops to warehouse to entertainment.<br/><br/>At Zenfinite Meditation Lounge, I have combined my experience in hospitality and the art &amp; science of nature to create an ambiance &amp; an experience that our zenfiniters can feel supported in our meditation space.</p><p><br/><strong>Our beginning...</strong></p><p>We were asked: “So, you want to start a business venture…”  “What is it going to be?”  “A Meditation Lounge?  What is that?” “Can you make a living on that?” “Why meditation?”</p><p>A myriad of questions our friends asked (and frankly, we asked ourselves) when they first hear about what we are trying to do.  The answers weren’t clear at first, but it felt right within our hearts… and we trusted it.  Soon the answers did become clear to us - things started to fall in place, and people came into our lives at the right time. We are very grateful for all the support and words of encouragement, and are truly thankful for those who are helping to make this dream of ours a reality.</p><p>So, the answers to the questions in the beginning of this post:</p><p>What is a Meditation Lounge?  Simply put, it is a fresh take on meditation.  We want to create a simple, sophisticated, and modern environment for people to meditate. </p><p>Make a living?  Sure!

I invite you to be a part of our little space in the urban city… to take a break from modern day life… to have a moment to zen out.As a kid, I ran around my family's hotel business, grew up watching & eventually involved in the many departments a hotel encompasses - from reception to housekeeping to restaurants to shops to warehouse to entertainment.At Zenfinite Meditation Lounge, I have combined my experience in hospitality and the art & science of nature to create an ambiance & an experience that our zenfiniters can feel supported in our meditation space.Our beginning...We were asked: “So, you want to start a business venture…”  “What is it going to be?”  “A Meditation Lounge?  What is that?” “Can you make a living on that?” “Why meditation?”A myriad of questions our friends asked (and frankly, we asked ourselves) when they first hear about what we are trying to do.  The answers weren’t clear at first, but it felt right within our hearts… and we trusted it.  Soon the answers did become clear to us - things started to fall in place, and people came into our lives at the right time. We are very grateful for all the support and words of encouragement, and are truly thankful for those who are helping to make this dream of ours a reality.So, the answers to the questions in the beginning of this post:What is a Meditation Lounge?  Simply put, it is a fresh take on meditation.  We want to create a simple, sophisticated, and modern environment for people to meditate. Make a living?  Sure! Well, we hope so. It is more about having the right balance in life. Life experiences have taught us that success comes in more than one flavor. It is not always about bottom lines, profit margins, or LCV-CAC > 0… although it helps to have those numbers to be positive.Why meditation?  We have benefited ourselves from it, and have witnessed how it has benefited others.   We believe in it, and we know that it is a place with people we would enjoy spending our time in and growing with.Our journey began in 2016 when we came across an opportunity to secure a place in an upcoming brand new community in Brea, California.  It’s quite exciting to see construction under way, and week after week we can see our place gradually coming together.  It is an indescribable feeling of seeing gradually the building taking shape into 3D from what we have envisioned based on a floor plan. Now we are finally able to physically see the amount of space we get to work with to create our mediation lounge. With any entrepreneurial venture the feeling of unknown is both exciting and uneasy.  You’re never sure if you’re making the right decisions... That’s the uneasy part. In fact you can guarantee that some of your choices will be wrong.  It’s a journey that allows you to learn about yourself and those around you. Soon you realize that the more you are true to yourself and to your beliefs, the more clearly the path becomes - opportunities and possibilities start to grow… That’s the exciting part. Fast forward to August 2017…  We are almost ready for launch!  This year has been all about learning… about all aspects of entrepreneurship, human emotions, & each other. We’ve gone through waves of ups and downs – emotional swings at various times between excitement and frustration, from being doubtful to being inspired. Looking back at the year, we realized we have already gained so much from this.  Our most treasured gains are the relationships we so luckily have been able to make. People have been mysteriously showing up at seemingly perfect moments into our lives.  We are very grateful to you all, and look forward to making more connections in the coming years.",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>About me</h3>
<p>I am Cat Matlock, Founder and Director of the West Asheville Yoga Studio and The Embodiment Center in downtown Asheville, NC.  I have practiced yoga for 30 years, taught for 15 years, and run the West Asheville Yoga Studio for 11 years.  I am also a Licensed Massage Therapist, with 25 years of experience, specializing in Trigger Point Therapy for Chronic Pain.  I developed UNWIND Therapeutics over the last 5 years which instructs people how to effectively use foam rollers and therapy balls to release binding and tension in their tissues to eliminate pain in their own bodies.  Over the years I have worked with tens of thousands of clients and students.  I am a volunteer yoga instructor for Light A Path, an organization providing yoga, dance, running, and other classes to youth at risk, the incarcerated, and the homeless populations in our area.  I am on the team offering yoga to incarcerated women in our community, supported by my training as a 500 hr Advanced Instructor of Therapeutic Yoga, Trauma Informed Yoga Therapy, and my certification as an Overcome Anxiety Clinic provider.  I have a YouTube Channel with videos teaching people how to work on themselves to alleviate their pain.</p>

<h3>West Asheville Yoga: Service and Success</h3>

<p><i><strong>I developed the West Asheville Yoga Studio with a heart of service </strong></i>and have successfully run this studio which began as the first sliding-scale affordable yoga studio in Asheville.  It was also the first Certified Living Wage yoga studio in our area.  During the last 11 years we have run many fundraisers for local and global organizations, offered programs in Community Resiliency Model subsidized by WAVL Yoga, stuffed backpacks with essential items for the homeless in our community, and annually run a <i><strong>“Sponsor A Foster Child for Christmas” program through which we sponsor 10-15% of all Foster children in Buncombe County</strong></i> with gifts for the Holidays.  We have done all of that through this tiny one room yoga studio.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Expansion of the Vision</h3>
<p>For years I have dreamed of expanding our programs to include <i><strong>Yoga for Recovery</strong></i>, <i><strong>Trauma Informed Yoga Therapy</strong></i>, and offering <i><strong>programs and trainings to help people to reduce anxiety and stress to live better, healthier, and more peaceful lives</strong></i>.   </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507045163/fdl77iddl5njfodhghhs.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I knew I needed a larger space to expand our service.  Earlier this year I was presented with the opportunity to purchase a large yoga center, One Center Yoga, and I took over August 1.  I now have a big, beautiful Yoga and Wellness Center and need financial support to assist growing the Center and development of new programs.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Founded in Yogic Teachings</h3>
<p>The root of The Embodiment Center is the <i><strong>Koshas</strong></i> (Sheaths), teachings from yogis texts called The Upanishads.  In this view of humans, we are 5 layered beings.  The outermost layer is our physical human body.  One layer in is our “sheath” of breath and energy.  Just deep to that is the layer of the mind, our thoughts and feelings.  Deeper still is our “intellect,” our core beliefs about ourselves and the world.  <i><strong> Our innermost layer is our core of radiant light and joy.</strong></i>  I believe that we use the practices of yoga, forgiveness, dance, meditation, etc to clear blockages in our outer 4 layers so that our inner radiance shines more brightly.  <i><strong>When we are resting in that inner radiance, we experience more joy, peace, and love.  From that experience, we shine that Light outwards into our families and communities with service, patience, and kindness.  </strong></i></p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>To grow this Center, rooted in deep yogic teachings and standing in service, we need help with the following:</h3>
<p>1- HVAC work in the facility</p>
<p>2- Plumbing upgrades</p>
<p>3- Sound proofing and sound system</p>
<p>4- Redesign and restructure of the retail space to include dedicated area for program support</p>
<p>5- Video and sound equipment for developing online programs</p>
<p>6- Sponsorship of Trauma Informed Yoga Therapy training participants</p>
<p>7- Sponsorship of Community Resiliency Model participants</p>
<p>8- Sponsorship of Yoga for Recovery Program so we can offer these courses by donation</p>
<p>9- Sponsorship of Overcome Anxiety Clinic participants </p>
<p>10- Marketing support to build our clientele for a broader base of paying clients to support the Center</p>
<p><i>My dream list would include an additional $50,000 to pay off the remaining debt of purchasing One Center Yoga so that I could move forward without the strain of that financial burden.  </i></p>

<h3>The mompreneurs of Barski Vail Designs, LLC</h3>
<p>It's amazing what can happen when a nurse and a Child Life Specialist team up! Karen Barski, RN and Chelsea Vail, CCLS both know the power of a tight swaddle. Karen saw how comforted her babies were by the peanut-shaped, 360 degree swaddle sack she sewed in her own home ten years ago. She later patented this design and it became known as the Woombie, helping over a million babies sleep safely through the night.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Chelsea, a child therapist, saw a correlation between a history of hospitalization, or separation from caregivers, and attachment and behavioral isues later in life. She knew swaddling aided in psychosocial care and promoted a sense of trust during infancy (an important building block for secure attachment), but she knew many babies are still left unswaddled, especially in hospitals. This had to change!</p>
<p>She reached back into her experiences as a Child Life Specialist and together, she and Karen designed Woombie Med Pods for hospitalized infants that work around medical devices. All of their designs meet the needs of specific patient populations and are offered in micropreemie, preemie and newborn sizes. Finally, these babies can be swaddled for warmth, comfort, and security, even during hospitalization!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499961987/jq9i7sppxz0r2ebhezdk.png"" src=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>Woombie Bili Pods allow 98% of phototherapy light to reach the skin.</li>
<li>Woombie Gastro Pods allow quick access to the midsection for babies with colostomy bags, g-buttons, umbilical cord complications, or gastroschisis. </li>
<li>Woombie Med Pod provides safe sleep, promotes healthy hips, provides flexion, and allows space for central lines, leads, and drains.</li>
<li>Woombie Trach Pods support babies with trachs, vents, post-operative cardiac needs, and more. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Many Hospitals Lack Budget for Developmental Care Products</h3>
<p>Despite the many benefits of Woombie Med Pods for these tiny patients, we're discovering that many hospitals simply don't have the funding for developmental care products.</p>
<p>Currently, they're using blankets to swaddle babies but...</p>
<ul>
<li>Blankets come loose and can become a SIDS risk</li>
<li>Blankets don't provide boundaries for security &amp; flexion (muscle tone)</li>
<li>Blankets need to be wrapped/unwrapped which can be overstimulating to a neonate and increase trauma from hospitalization</li>
<li>Blankets don't work around medical devices, therefore many babies are left unswaddled</li>
<li>Blankets can't be used for ""bili babies"" because phototherapy can't reach the skin<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499962031/sgtujher8fl3r0jfga41.jpg"" src=""""/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hospitals rely primarily on sponsorships and donations which is why we need your help! We want to send Woombie Med Pods to children's hospitals and mother/baby units in need across the US!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will change the lives of these babies and their caregivers and decrease the risks of physical, mental, and emotional impairment from hospitalization. Changing those first few months of life for the better will set these babies on the path to becoming healthy, happy kids. Sponsoring a Woombie Med Pod is the first step towards changing the way babies in the hospitals are cared for, therefore we're changing the world for the better one baby at a time. </p>

</div><div><p>Money raised during this campaign will provide Woombie Med Pods for hospitals with insufficent funds, get Karen and Chelsea to conferences to promote the value of these products, and start the wave for global change in infant care.</p></div><div>
<h3>Help Spread the Word</h3>
<p>We know sometimes the heart wants more than the wallet allows, especially when it comes to supporting a cause you're passionate about. If you can't sponsor a Woombie Med Pod for a baby in need, help us by spreading the word about our products and campaign.</p>
<ul>
<li>Talk about these with friends and family!</li>
<li>Post a link to our Indiegogo page on social media!</li>
<li>Follow us on youtube, Facebook, instagram, and twitter and interact with our posts!</li>
<li>Tell your friends in the medical industry about the many benefits of Woombie Med Pods!</li>

She later patented this design and it became known as the Woombie, helping over a million babies sleep safely through the night.
Meanwhile Chelsea, a child therapist, saw a correlation between a history of hospitalization, or separation from caregivers, and attachment and behavioral isues later in life. She knew swaddling aided in psychosocial care and promoted a sense of trust during infancy (an important building block for secure attachment), but she knew many babies are still left unswaddled, especially in hospitals. This had to change!
She reached back into her experiences as a Child Life Specialist and together, she and Karen designed Woombie Med Pods for hospitalized infants that work around medical devices. All of their designs meet the needs of specific patient populations and are offered in micropreemie, preemie and newborn sizes. Finally, these babies can be swaddled for warmth, comfort, and security, even during hospitalization!


Woombie Bili Pods allow 98% of phototherapy light to reach the skin.
Woombie Gastro Pods allow quick access to the midsection for babies with colostomy bags, g-buttons, umbilical cord complications, or gastroschisis. 
Woombie Med Pod provides safe sleep, promotes healthy hips, provides flexion, and allows space for central lines, leads, and drains.
Woombie Trach Pods support babies with trachs, vents, post-operative cardiac needs, and more. 


Many Hospitals Lack Budget for Developmental Care Products
Despite the many benefits of Woombie Med Pods for these tiny patients, we're discovering that many hospitals simply don't have the funding for developmental care products.
Currently, they're using blankets to swaddle babies but...

Blankets come loose and can become a SIDS risk
Blankets don't provide boundaries for security & flexion (muscle tone)
Blankets need to be wrapped/unwrapped which can be overstimulating to a neonate and increase trauma from hospitalization
Blankets don't work around medical devices, therefore many babies are left unswaddled
Blankets can't be used for ""bili babies"" because phototherapy can't reach the skin


Hospitals rely primarily on sponsorships and donations which is why we need your help! We want to send Woombie Med Pods to children's hospitals and mother/baby units in need across the US!

The Impact
Your contribution will change the lives of these babies and their caregivers and decrease the risks of physical, mental, and emotional impairment from hospitalization. Changing those first few months of life for the better will set these babies on the path to becoming healthy, happy kids. Sponsoring a Woombie Med Pod is the first step towards changing the way babies in the hospitals are cared for, therefore we're changing the world for the better one baby at a time. 

Money raised during this campaign will provide Woombie Med Pods for hospitals with insufficent funds, get Karen and Chelsea to conferences to promote the value of these products, and start the wave for global change in infant care.
Help Spread the Word
We know sometimes the heart wants more than the wallet allows, especially when it comes to supporting a cause you're passionate about. If you can't sponsor a Woombie Med Pod for a baby in need, help us by spreading the word about our products and campaign.

Talk about these with friends and family!

</h3>
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>We are the Institute for the Development of Human Arts, a community of mental health clinicians, psychiatrists, peer workers, advocates, artists, and survivors of trauma and adversity, who are interested in exploring the link between personal and societal transformation. We understand that it is time for a new paradigm in mental health: one that does not deny anyone their right to self-determination and healing, one that accounts for the complexity of personal, social, and collective traumas and oppressions, one that opens up our narrow definition of ""normal"" for the full range of human experience, and allows us to look beyond medicalized and disease-centered thinking to more regenerative, holistic, and transformative practices.</p>
<p>We believe that change happens through dynamic collaboration between clinicians in the field and advocates on the frontlines dedicated to shifting policy and practice while at the same time helping to build and uplift safe alternatives. To do this, we create opportunities for critical dialogue, mutual support, and advanced education and training for those in the field. Join us as we launch our first course series to the public:</p>

<p>The IDHA community is offering a unique opportunity for mental health workers of all kinds in the Greater New York City area to learn from a team of esteemed practitioners and experts by experience. We've seen and experienced the more traditional mental health training programs, and we're dedicated to offering something different, to proliferating new understanding by challenging the dominant models and highlighting the voices of those with lived experience and first-hand knowledge. Our classes will survey topics such as :</p>

</ul>
<p>Together, we will explore ground-breaking research, theory and practices, first-person perspectives, and cross-cultural evidence supporting the need for more transformative models of care.  We are here to pave the way for new and innovative approaches by increasing the number of mental health workers, family members, and survivors who are trained in these methods and can build communities of transformative practice in their own ways. </p>
<h3>Join Forces and Equalize Access!</h3>
<p>At IDHA one of our primary goals is to Equalize Access, which means: We recognize that access to quality mental health care, opportunity, and education is not equal across society. Therefore we work to promote access to our offerings through financial scholarships, access for people with disabilities, and through our outreach methods. </p>
<p>It's important to us that we offer our classes and trainings to everyone, regardless of class, race, gender, sexuality, ability, nationality, and individual experiences of mental health. <strong>However, in order to make our training available and accessible for all, we need YOUR support</strong>. We hope to offer <strong>over 10 full scholarship positions</strong> and have already enrolled students at our reduced rate. In order to cover our costs and pay for our faculty, staff, course materials, free community events, and outreach, we aim to raise a total of $7,000 before the start of our course. To break it down:</p>
<ul>
<li>$5,000 will provide 10 students with access to our full 8-week course (at $500 per student) </li>
<li>$2,000 will support IDHA's operating costs AND allow us to continue to offer free events to the public and other online networking opportunities to those who cannot take the full course or attend in person.</li>

<h3>About Cura Sana and the impact of this campaign</h3>
<p>First and foremost I am a mother. Working with the mother instinct of taking care of my children was one of the strongest sources for the creation of these medicines, wanting to bring healing to my own family. I've been working with local plants here in Costa Rica for over 6 years, the business of Cura Sana started about 5 years ago.</p>
<p>The importance of this fundraiser; Cura Sana has already brought health and well-being to a lot of people on this earth, The business is ripe and ready for expansion, for reaching many more people who will benefit from these products. </p>
<p>The use of herbal remedies is ancient, it is the foundation of medicine as we know it today. These remedies have proved themselves to be beneficial to a wide variety of dis-eases, and by contributing to this campaign it will support the distribution of them far and wide.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order for these medicines to reach far and wide there is a process of registration and certification that needs to take place. This is what the campaign is for; to create the foundation for Cura Sana to distribute freely and without limitation. To register the company alone costs $700 dollars, and the registration of each product is $500-700. There are 12 main products. In order to get the health permits, we also need to have a laboratory that is up to standard with materials and equipment. This is where the money is going. If the goal is not reached, then we will register as many products as possible.</p>
<p>For those of you who have not experienced the gift of Cura Sana products, then this is your opportunity. Everyone can receive something from these products, whether it's on a level of internal or external healing. Whether it's your immune system, your emotions or your skin.</p>

In addition, because we believe that everyone deserves a chance at recovery, Sponsors Corner is committed to a minimum scholarship rate of 20% of the beds available.  After 35 years of putting people first and providing 3,000 clients with a spiritual path to recovery, our roof, furnace, and bedrooms are in disrepair.  We are in urgent need of renovations that will guarantee our survival and enable us to become a premier provider of sober living and transitional services. Along with a group of dedicated Alumni and Friends of Sponsors Corner, we have implemented a plan that will ensure we can thrive. We ask your support in helping us raise $30,000.  We have already achieved over half our goal of $500,000. in the general campaign fund.  Sponsors Corner sits on 15 acres of beautiful riverbank property. This campaign is part of Phase One, which includes renovating the main house with 17 beds, dining room and meditation room and the admissions office. This phase also includes restoring the gym and open air pavilion. What will we do with $30,000 ? Sponsors Corner  will renovate 10 bedrooms that are waiting to be used by members of our community.  At the center of Sponsors Corner recovery culture is Bob Sullivan. Bob retired from the NYPD in 1983 and has focused ever since on selflessly carrying the message of recovery and freeing people from the crippling bondage of addiction. Bob has over 35 years of sobriety and is well known and respected throughout the state and espically in the Orange County recovery community, where Bob’s “No One Left Behind” motto is heard daily. Sponsors Corner is a 501c3 non profit established in 2011 has a committed and diverse board, involved both financially and operationally, with representation and expertise from business to wellness.",7.0,0,"2 Campaigns

He began with massage then went further to the idea of holistic approach to rehabilitation and recovery.  This approach is based on the idea of recovering the whole organism and includes elements of yoga, pilates, exercises with training apparatus, breathing exercises, healthy food, psychology of healthy lifestyle. Over 10- year practice,  annual advanced qualification courses, more than 8 professional trainings, professional workshops and conferences, having all these in arsenal, Armen is specialized in locomotor apparatus diseases, neurology, recovery after  apoplexy, coronary thrombosis, different kinds of traumas. Now Armen’s clients are from all social clusters,  people who need psychological and rehabilitation help.
 
What We Need & What You Get
With the help of two crowdfunding   campaigns, own funds,  World Vison Armenia and European Union funding Armen has already created place for massage and fitness trainings in ARK Camp Kapan, where one can get a  massage, or train in yoga, pilates or learn to breathe happily enjoying gorgeous view of majestic mount Khustup. But unfortunately, there is lack of training apparatus that makes the rehabilitation process faster and more effective.

 On our way to creating better conditions for harmonic and healthy lifestyle we are taking the next step and launching a new campaign – ARK Holistica. With this campaign we will be able to purchase all necessary equipment for ARK rehabilitation center.

Leg muscles simulator to decrease loading on spine through amortization effect.
Pectoral muscles simulator to improve mobility of thorax that will result in deep and light breathing.
Back muscles simulator to strengthen the muscles of the prelum abdominal  and to facilitate functioning of vertebral column and as a result that of internals.

Training apparatuses need to be placed in an open-air pavilion to protect them from bad weather conditions. All equipment will be installed in ARK Eco Camp Kapan and will grant a chance of recovery and happy life to many people in Kapan as well as ARK guests from Armenia and all over the world.. You can find our detailed budget (here).

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are many risks and challenges that come with opening a Spa, and we do not take any of them lightly. Our biggest challenge at this time is going to be familiarizing ourselves with Health regulations and being sure we are all up to code in each area. The next largest challenge will be sorting out the logistics of the operations: the 24-hour access, rules and regulations for members/clients and practitioners, liability waivers, etc. We have a pretty good handle on how our systems will work and are not shy about enlisting the proper professionals when needed. Aside from those, the next biggest challenge will be learning to run and maintain the different equipment, mainly the Float Cabin. </p>

<h3>About the CEO - Tim O'Connor</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Having been an international award winning serial entrepreneur in technology, Tim made the radical move to take on billion dollar corporations dumping chemicals in Hand Sanitisers. </p>
<p>But getting into consumer products was a new challenge. Tim had no idea on what products contained especially skin products until he became a doting, over the top Dad who wanted the best for his miracle little girl. ""If hospitals were using it, then that must be the best, right?  WRONG! "" </p>
<p>""I started reading ingredients on the back of bottles and had no idea what the ingredients were.""  ""I became obsessed with what we were putting in and on our bodies and was stunned by how big corporations create products laden with toxic chemcials"".</p>
<p>A few years later, an opportunity came up to use some intellectual property that had eucalyptus oil in it – apparently a miracle natural oil.  Fast forward to today and Elyptol has come a long way from just Eucalyptus oil - magical essential oil.</p>
<p>Elyptol’s mission has remained the same but the products have developed into the best in the world, tons of accolades and loads of awards. We provide products that are 100% natural, effective, moisturizing and healing to the skin and using products that once empty can be reused, recyclable or compostable.  We are focused not just on skin health but also on the environment. </p>
<p>All natural ingredients that you understand. Millions of dollars into testing to make sure we conform to all health standards and regulatory registrations.</p>
<p>But now we want to get our message out to everyone because everyone, just like you, deserves to have access to products without toxic chemicals and ingredients that don’t harm you or your family.</p>
<p>We need your help. Without it, Elyptol won’t survive the onslaught of those larger corporates supplying us with false advertising, products with massive amounts of toxic chemicals in them all to make their products cheaper. </p>
<p>If you purchase our campaign, you will benefit from the discounts and very soon, more than get your campaign donation back.</p>
<p>Help us help you.</p>

About the CEO - Tim O'Connor


Having been an international award winning serial entrepreneur in technology, Tim made the radical move to take on billion dollar corporations dumping chemicals in Hand Sanitisers. 
But getting into consumer products was a new challenge. Tim had no idea on what products contained especially skin products until he became a doting, over the top Dad who wanted the best for his miracle little girl. ""If hospitals were using it, then that must be the best, right?  WRONG! "" 
""I started reading ingredients on the back of bottles and had no idea what the ingredients were.""  ""I became obsessed with what we were putting in and on our bodies and was stunned by how big corporations create products laden with toxic chemcials"".
A few years later, an opportunity came up to use some intellectual property that had eucalyptus oil in it – apparently a miracle natural oil.  Fast forward to today and Elyptol has come a long way from just Eucalyptus oil - magical essential oil.
Elyptol’s mission has remained the same but the products have developed into the best in the world, tons of accolades and loads of awards. We provide products that are 100% natural, effective, moisturizing and healing to the skin and using products that once empty can be reused, recyclable or compostable.  We are focused not just on skin health but also on the environment. 
All natural ingredients that you understand. Millions of dollars into testing to make sure we conform to all health standards and regulatory registrations.
But now we want to get our message out to everyone because everyone, just like you, deserves to have access to products without toxic chemicals and ingredients that don’t harm you or your family.
We need your help. Without it, Elyptol won’t survive the onslaught of those larger corporates supplying us with false advertising, products with massive amounts of toxic chemicals in them all to make their products cheaper. 
If you purchase our campaign, you will benefit from the discounts and very soon, more than get your campaign donation back.
Help us help you.",21.0,5,"1 Campaign

<p>One of the proper flossing techniques recommended by the dentist is to curve the floss around the teeth. This technique is known as the ""C"" shape technique. Easy Flosser is the only device that easily allows you to adjust the tension of the floss; start by reducing the amount of tension of the floss as shown in the video, then slide it gently to the base of the tooth then move the Easy Flosser up and down between the walls of adjacent teeth, scraping off the plaque. If the floss gets stuck between the teeth, slide the floss in a back and forth motion and bring the floss up, if floss remains stuck, unlock the floss by releasing the lock button, then pull the Easy Flosser slowly out of your mouth.</p>
<p><strong>Remember</strong>: </p>
<ul>
<li>Never force the floss or you can hurt the gums.</li>
<li>There is no reason to have the floss too tight for effective plaque removal, so we recommend to loosening the floss tension to avoid injuries to the gum, it also allows the floss to cover more tooth surface.</li>
<li> Do not loosen the floss too much, or it will be difficult to maneuver between teeth. <br/> </li>
</ul>

<p>Brushing and flossing are both important for your oral health. Brushing only removes plaque from the front and back surfaces of your teeth. Flossing, on the other hand, allows you to remove plaque from between your teeth and underneath the gums. Be aware that where the most destructive microbes live is in these hard-to-reach spots. You need a tool that can easily allow you to get to these spots. </p>
<p>Bad breath, tooth decay, and gum problems will develop unless plaque is removed. If you haven't been flossing, your gums might bleed when you start. It's never too late to start flossing. Even if you never have flossed before, start now!</p>
<p><strong>Top 5 benefits of flossing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Prevent bad breath and keeps your smile clean.</li>
<li>Millions of bacteria and other germs can be found in your oral cavity, so flossing your teeth reduces gum disease. </li>
<li>It doesn't take long for plaque to accumulate on your teeth. Flossing prevents tartar Build-Up if done daily. </li>
<li>10x time more effective than brushing. </li>
<li>Save money. Reduce dentist visits that could be costly. </li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, Good oral hygiene keeps you healthy so floss every day and keep the dentist away. </p>

These four streams are:</p><ol>
<li>Integrative Medicine,</li>
<li>Functional Medicine</li>
<li>Restorative Medicine</li>
<li>Age Management Medicine</li>
</ol><p>In principle these names are <strong>abstract designations</strong> for the sum of the total of <strong>each one's modus operandi</strong>, and so rather than <strong>drawing contrasts</strong> our object is to put the emphasis on <strong>what we can become together</strong>, since together we can make <strong>the biggest impact</strong> on humanity.</p><p><strong>To make it practical</strong>, one of my <strong>General Practitioner (M.D.) friends</strong> says that one of his <strong>banal tasks</strong> is to explain the same things over and over again to his patients and for him it would be wonderful if he <strong>could offer them a course</strong> to learn these things. This is then <strong>another service</strong> the academy wants to offer to such doctors and/or medical personnel, courses <strong>extending/expanding their educational doctor-patient relationships</strong>, and where applicable, relieve them from <strong>endless repetitions</strong>, or just <strong>deepen their medical services</strong>. Tailor made is being <strong>defined very broadly</strong>, and can mean either <strong>standard CM courses</strong> deployed, but can also be <strong>100% tailor made courses</strong> on request for a particular context and/or praxis. <strong>Please see perks below for possible compilations</strong>.</p><table border=""1""><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>“Part of our working hypothesis is not an either… or…, but an and… and…, when it comes to mainstream/school medicine.

In the first place we need time, and since time is money we need money.”</strong></p></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><strong><strong> </strong></strong></h3><p>Differently put, <strong>if I can reach the campaign goal</strong> I will free myself from most if not all other teaching obligations and only focus on <strong>this investment to humanity</strong>. As long as I have to develop this academy, <strong>only in my free time</strong>, so long it will stay <strong>limited in focus</strong> and never become more than just a side job.</p><p><strong>A few other tangible points</strong> I can list are:</p><ol>
<li>
<strong>Hardware </strong>- like a managed server, as well as a good computer I don’t have right now (my only computer is an old Samsung netbook)</li>
<li>
<strong>Software </strong>- the right platform with plugins, etc. The success of online education is when the medium is not even being noticed by the students. A good app can be added to this list.</li>
<li>
<strong>Administrative and other logistics</strong> - sharing too much teaching/curriculum development time with administrative work and logistical issues is counterproductive, not to mention counselling and coaching keeping us/the academy in the center of the community</li>
<li><strong>Marketing</strong></li>
<li><strong>Legal matters</strong></li>
</ol><p>So what are the perks the academy wants to offer its investors/contributors/participators?</p><p><strong>For the public</strong>:</p><ol>

</ol><p>What will happen if <strong>I don’t reach the goal?</strong> Obviously it depends how far <strong>I’ve missed the mark</strong>, but in principle it would either imply that <strong>it will only take longer</strong> to fully deploy the academy, or in <strong>the worst case scenario</strong> that it will become <strong>a niche academy</strong>. The above <strong>perks should stay intact</strong>, even in the worst case scenario. Differently put, <strong>the money pledged</strong> will go for nothing else but this academy.</p><h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3><table border=""1""><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>“The impact and legacy this down-to-earth online and affordable decentralized health and (w)holeness education will bring about can’t be overstated.”</strong></p></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><strong><strong> </strong></strong></h3><p><strong>Years of online teaching experience</strong>, as well as the <strong>successful designing of 2 online syllabuses</strong> for a college, give me the confidence to guarantee success for those that join this academy (irrespective of their educational background, e.g.).</p><table border=""1""><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>“Complementary Medicine Doctors that choose to integrate this academy in their praxises will see the difference in the added level of trust that will flow from the entrusted DIY.”</strong></p></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><strong><strong> </strong></strong></h3><p>Differently put, this will put the doctor-patient relationship <strong>on a new plain</strong>, a plain of <strong>cooperation and consultancy</strong>. This is not the place <strong>to stimulate</strong> any doctor’s <strong>imagination</strong>, but the presupposition is that <strong>equal revenue</strong> can be made <strong>with prevention and eliminations</strong>, if not more, than with treating only symptoms (<strong>illnesses and calamities are part and partial of this fallen world</strong>, but <strong>trust and genuine care</strong> is what let doctors transcend above this fallen world).</p><p>The impact is also <strong>reciprocal</strong>, since I will be <strong>meeting a basic need</strong> of humanity, a need <strong>so easily taken for granted</strong> by those that have it, but soon very evident when it is <strong>missing</strong>. Reciprocal is also because <strong>I have been there myself</strong>, and know what it means <strong>to long for</strong> health and (w)holeness, and thus the joy <strong>when others indeed attain it</strong>. Actually <strong>the biggest joy</strong> is to be with those that <strong>never lose</strong> their health and (w)holeness.</p><h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3><table border=""1""><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>“My biggest risk is the possible success that can draw negativity from people like the big pharma, and whoever else.”</strong></p></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><strong><strong> </strong></strong></h3><p>That is, however, where Germany is <strong>not a bad location</strong> to operate this <strong>global endeavor</strong> from, since these kinds of <strong>alternatives </strong>or <strong>additions </strong>to mainstream/school medicine <strong>enjoy great privileges in Germany</strong>. Should I reach the campaign goal, and <strong>burn the bridges</strong> of my other occupations, then <strong>I will need the community</strong>.</p><table border=""1""><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>“My biggest challenge is to get this campaign out there for the most people to read and to reach my goal. Embedded in this challenge is to avoid becoming too academic; I want to stay close to people (so please help me if that happens).”</strong></p></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><strong><strong> </strong></strong></h3><h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3><p>The ethos of this academy is <strong>decentralized ownership</strong>, and thus just by reading this <strong>you are already helping</strong>, even if you can’t pledge any money. On the flipside this means decentralized ownership is that <strong>this endeavor needs you to spread the news</strong>, I need you to get this campaign out there.</p><table border=""1""><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>“This endeavor needs your social network and so my request to please use the Indiegogo share tools for that, and spread the news on your electronic social network.”</strong></p></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><strong><strong> </strong></strong></h3><p>Finally, once the academy is live and up and running <strong>your biggest contribution will be</strong> to participate, not only in the courses, but also in the <strong>forum </strong>and/or <strong>blog </strong>and <strong>the whole spectrum of social networking</strong> the academy will offer.</p><table border=""1""><tbody><tr><td>

These four streams are:
Integrative Medicine,
Functional Medicine
Restorative Medicine
Age Management Medicine
In principle these names are abstract designations for the sum of the total of each one's modus operandi, and so rather than drawing contrasts our object is to put the emphasis on what we can become together, since together we can make the biggest impact on humanity.To make it practical, one of my General Practitioner (M.D.) friends says that one of his banal tasks is to explain the same things over and over again to his patients and for him it would be wonderful if he could offer them a course to learn these things. This is then another service the academy wants to offer to such doctors and/or medical personnel, courses extending/expanding their educational doctor-patient relationships, and where applicable, relieve them from endless repetitions, or just deepen their medical services. Tailor made is being defined very broadly, and can mean either standard CM courses deployed, but can also be 100% tailor made courses on request for a particular context and/or praxis. Please see perks below for possible compilations.“Part of our working hypothesis is not an either… or…, but an and… and…, when it comes to mainstream/school medicine. Complementary medicine is the and… and… example, while the DIY for everyone even takes it one step further by adding still an additional complementary trust relationship between doctors and their patients.” Call it an additional consultant-patron relationship if you like, or an advisor-novice relationship (see more below under The Impact).“Any M.D. praxis that decides to invest and coorporate with our academy, and especially those that got their own tailor made course(s) put together, with e.g. their own logo and access restricted to their own patients only, has the right to markup the price that is being passed on to their patients, or make their own judgement when and if it is necessary from patient to patient (please see examples of topics at the bottom).” What We Need & What You Get“So what do we need for the success of fully fleshing out of this academy? In the first place we need time, and since time is money we need money.” Differently put, if I can reach the campaign goal I will free myself from most if not all other teaching obligations and only focus on this investment to humanity. As long as I have to develop this academy, only in my free time, so long it will stay limited in focus and never become more than just a side job.A few other tangible points I can list are:

Hardware - like a managed server, as well as a good computer I don’t have right now (my only computer is an old Samsung netbook)

Software - the right platform with plugins, etc. The success of online education is when the medium is not even being noticed by the students. A good app can be added to this list.

Administrative and other logistics - sharing too much teaching/curriculum development time with administrative work and logistical issues is counterproductive, not to mention counselling and coaching keeping us/the academy in the center of the community
Marketing
Legal matters
So what are the perks the academy wants to offer its investors/contributors/participators?For the public:

From $10 – a lifetime 10% discount on all courses and counseling/coaching

From $50 – a lifetime 20% discount on all courses and 10% discount on counseling/coaching

Short stand alone courses, like IM courses, don’t count as full length ones, but enjoy the 70% discount

From $1500 - $1 for 6 full length courses, or chunked courses up to 6 full length courses, plus 70% lifetime discount on all courses and 55% discount on counseling/coaching for up to 10 sessions then lifetime 20% (sessions transferable to immediate family).

From $5000 - $1 for all courses and counseling/coaching* for always (immediate family included and anyone else on request**)
* Counseling and coaching with reasonable and customary scheduling, restricted to fair use** Reservations, due to possible abuse, reside with the academyComplementary additions for Medical Doctors:

From $1000 - $1 for 750 complementary medicine courses (direct customer service is the responsibility of the praxis, and not the academy, although indirect customer service is, like FAQs and tutorials)

From $1500- $1 for 750 complementary medicine courses with customer services

From $2000 - $2 per complementary medicine course per patient, and 2 short individually tailor made course (+/- 40 minutes) (direct customer service is the responsibility of the praxis, and not the academy, although indirect customer service is, like FAQs and tutorials) (Lifecycle minimum 3 years)

From $3000 - $2 per complementary medicine course per patient, and 3 short individually tailor made courses (+/- 40 minutes per course) (direct customer service is the responsibility of the praxis, and not the academy, although indirect customer service is, like FAQs and tutorials) (Lifecycle minimum 4 years)

From $4000 - $2 per complementary medicine course per patient, and 4 short individually tailor made course (+/- 40 minutes per course). The academy offers customer service and 4 free major updates/revises on each individual course (Lifecycle minimum 5 years)

From $5000 - $1 per complementary medicine course per patient, and 4 short individually tailor made courses (+/- 40 minutes per course). The academy offers customer service and 4 free major updates/revises on each individual course (Lifecycle minimum 5 years)

From $15000 - $1 to negotiate any tailor made package more inclusive than any of the previous complementary medicine packages
What will happen if I don’t reach the goal? Obviously it depends how far I’ve missed the mark, but in principle it would either imply that it will only take longer to fully deploy the academy, or in the worst case scenario that it will become a niche academy. The above perks should stay intact, even in the worst case scenario. Differently put, the money pledged will go for nothing else but this academy.The Impact“The impact and legacy this down-to-earth online and affordable decentralized health and (w)holeness education will bring about can’t be overstated.” Years of online teaching experience, as well as the successful designing of 2 online syllabuses for a college, give me the confidence to guarantee success for those that join this academy (irrespective of their educational background, e.g.).“Complementary Medicine Doctors that choose to integrate this academy in their praxises will see the difference in the added level of trust that will flow from the entrusted DIY.” Differently put, this will put the doctor-patient relationship on a new plain, a plain of cooperation and consultancy. This is not the place to stimulate any doctor’s imagination, but the presupposition is that equal revenue can be made with prevention and eliminations, if not more, than with treating only symptoms (illnesses and calamities are part and partial of this fallen world, but trust and genuine care is what let doctors transcend above this fallen world).The impact is also reciprocal, since I will be meeting a basic need of humanity, a need so easily taken for granted by those that have it, but soon very evident when it is missing. Reciprocal is also because I have been there myself, and know what it means to long for health and (w)holeness, and thus the joy when others indeed attain it. Actually the biggest joy is to be with those that never lose their health and (w)holeness.Risks & Challenges“My biggest risk is the possible success that can draw negativity from people like the big pharma, and whoever else.” That is, however, where Germany is not a bad location to operate this global endeavor from, since these kinds of alternatives or additions to mainstream/school medicine enjoy great privileges in Germany. Should I reach the campaign goal, and burn the bridges of my other occupations, then I will need the community.“My biggest challenge is to get this campaign out there for the most people to read and to reach my goal. Embedded in this challenge is to avoid becoming too academic; I want to stay close to people (so please help me if that happens).” Other Ways You Can HelpThe ethos of this academy is decentralized ownership, and thus just by reading this you are already helping, even if you can’t pledge any money. On the flipside this means decentralized ownership is that this endeavor needs you to spread the news, I need you to get this campaign out there.“This endeavor needs your social network and so my request to please use the Indiegogo share tools for that, and spread the news on your electronic social network.” Finally, once the academy is live and up and running your biggest contribution will be to participate, not only in the courses, but also in the forum and/or blog and the whole spectrum of social networking the academy will offer.
Examples Of Complementary Medicine Courses For Use By M.D.s.

<p>I'm Ant Smith, somewhat (in)famous small-penised poet. I wrote a poem about size anxiety almost 3 years ago and ever since then I've been giving interviews and writing articles for the world's media.</p>
<p>After living with size anxiety for almost 50 years, and having researched all things small-penis related for almost 3 years I wanted to bring all that experience together to help others. So I wrote The Small Penis Bible.</p>
<p>This book isn't like any other penis-anxiety book available (there aren't any enlargement scams in it!). It's a mix of autobiography and relentless research presented in a lightweight, easy-to-read format. And with illustrations too!</p>
<p>I'm sure you appreciate how pervasive and destructive this male body image concern is. I really want something very positive to turn up in search results when people are looking for help with this matter.</p>

<p>To get the book 'out there' I want to hold a launch event - which is already shaping up to be a helluva night. There will be costs involved so by donating here you can help covers those AND lay your hands on a pre-launch copy of the bible to boot!</p>
<p>The funds will help cover any venue costs and stock costs for the launch. If I raise more than needed then I'll disperse the rest amongst the volunteers who will be helping me with the launch event.</p>
<p>Three years ago it would have been impossible to image that UK Breakfast TV would cover the question of penis size anxiety - but that's just what they did when they interviewed me last year.

<p><strong>Story:</strong></p>
<p>Lycomplete is a powerful 100% organic and bioavailable antioxidant supplement that will help consumers combat cardiovascular risks, degenerative diseases, tumors and much more. The extraction process involves cutting edge technology that creates the first and only 100% bioavailable organic lycopene supplement available. Lycomplete  uses Supercritical CO2 to extract a 100% bioavailable lycopene without creating any toxins. It's safe for the environment and ensures a supplement that protects health and defends against disease.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that free radicals from oxygen may be the primary cause of cardiovascular diseases. Supplemeting one's healthy and balanced diet with a powerful antioxidant provides an additional safeguard against these higly reactive and damaging particles. Lycopene's incredible powers have been used as a defense against cardiovascular disease, tumors, degenerative diseases, osteoporosis, diabetes, male infertility, skin diseases, and senile macular degeneration.</p>
<div>
<div>

<p>We operate with a humanitarian focus and philosophy along with responsible manufacturing.  Our production plant is environmental friendly and doesn’t produce byproducts or gas emissions in the atmosphere. </p>
<p>The shell of Lycomplete is produced by <a href=""http://www.capsugel.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Capsugel </a>from their (Vcaps) capsules which are a two-piece capsule made of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, a cellulose-based raw material.

<div><strong>Why Antioxidants are important:</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Antioxidants are essential to human health because they stop the actions of free radicals, by-products naturally created in the body cells as the result of metabolic oxidative processes. The constant action of free radicals can be seen mainly in the premature ageing of cells and in the rise of several more-or-less dangerous diseases, and cancer.</div>

Why Antioxidants are important:
 
Antioxidants are essential to human health because they stop the actions of free radicals, by-products naturally created in the body cells as the result of metabolic oxidative processes. The constant action of free radicals can be seen mainly in the premature ageing of cells and in the rise of several more-or-less dangerous diseases, and cancer.

Difference in products:
The developed and patented technology allows the extraction of active ingredients from solid or liquid matrices and allows the splitting of the vegetable extracts. Other competitive products are utilizing a chemical solvent process, which leaves behind a small number of toxins, and this is what differentiates Lycomplete versus any natural or synthetic version of a Lycopene supplement. In the below image you can see the small spec's of Lycopene represented in a competitors product, the rest is inert material. Where as with Organic Lycopene shown in bulk form here you can see the difference. SEE THE DIFFERENCE

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Kate Leist and I am the founder of Soulrise Movement. I have been practicing yoga for twelve years and teaching for four. When I started teaching I began diving into my own healing process/self-development journey. In the process of teaching and my own healing I had some unnerving realizations. A lot of my own suffering was self-induced from overdoing it, being too busy, and then at the end of the day feeding myself negative self-talk about how I didn't accomplish enough. When I was 11 I begged my dad to put in ad in the paper lying and saying that I was 12 so that I could start babysitting, thus started my babysitting career. When I was 14 I started working 4 days a week at a Chinese restaurant while attending high school. In college I worked full-time as a server/bartender while attending school full-time. My friends make fun of me for having ""12"" jobs. I currently teach 4 classes per week plus regular workshops, work part-time at a wine bar, part-time at the Ritz-Carlton, and part-time as a dog-sitter. All I have ever known is to be too busy and working as hard as I possibly can. I know many people who can relate to this. This started wearing on me the past few years. I lost my creative spark and stopped doing art. I rarely saw my friends and family. My relationships suffered. I kept getting sick. I experienced several wake-up calls including a potentially deadly car accident. The universe was trying to get me to wake up to the reality of my situation and help me see that this is not a sustainable way to live my life.  As I became aware of this I noticed it with my students as well and I saw how it trickled negatively into their work, relationships, and home life. I realized that things don't have to be this way and we have more control than we think. I wanted to know how to solve this within my own life and how to help others, so I attended several self-development/spiritual trainings that gave me some useful tools to remedy this issue. It was after a Sprit Junkie Masterclass training with Gabby Bernstein in NY that I gained clarity on how exactly I want to help people overcome this suffering. Most of us aren't able to drop everything and go on a month long yoga retreat in Bali or even have enough time to attend a yoga class...so I created Soulrise Movement; short guided audio and video of breathing exercises, meditations, and simply yoga for busy lifestyles. Starting your day with a few minutes of deep breathing, stillness, and quiet can impact your whole day (positively). Soulrise Movement was created to show people that there are simple tools we can incorporate into our lives to feel more grounded, less frantic and overwhelmed, less reactionary, and more intentional. When we are rooted and connected to our inner self we can begin saying 'no' more often, setting boundaries, and learning our own limitations and give ourselves permission to honor those limitations. </p>
<p>When I started Soulrise Movement I actually thought to myself it would be simple and somewhat easy...it's just an online business, how hard could it be? (haha, very funny Kate). I thought I could do everything by myself and create all of my own videos by myself. It turns out I am not a big fan of technology, video editing, or computers in general. You might ask why I am starting an online business? I know, it sounds silly. I was resistant for years, but this is THE way to REACH people. If everyone is going to be staring into their phones all the time then I am going to put myself right in there where they can find me. I created this campaign because I have realized I need help. I need help creating content, creating an app, and using marketing strategies to reach a wider audience. I also need to eventually hire a team of people to help me; perhaps a partner that is savvy with the techy stuff, a videographer, and in my wildest dreams a personal assistant (: </p>
<p>My entire life I have been the idea person, the girl who calls her best friend and tells her about the latest and greatest idea and that THIS is the one that is going to make me successful! I've had hundreds of business ideas that didn't go anywhere. Soulrise Movement is the one idea that has become a reality. I feel deeply compelled to share this offering with the world. I have seen firsthand how the tools I have learned have helped me to become the person I am now. These tools have helped me overcome fear and doubt, heal from past traumas that kept me stuck, find clarity of my purpose, and find the strength and courage to go after what I want. I want to share these tools and techniques so that many people can improve their quality of life and start living healthier, happier, more intentional lives. </p>
<p>I hired an amazing team- Alpen Creative, to help me create a badass video (that is exactly what I said when I met them...""Ima need a badass video"") This video shows what Soulrise Movement is, why I am doing it, and why I need your help. Your contribution will go towards creating more content, finding and funding the support I need to grow this business (techy people!), and will help me to fulfill my dream of creating a thriving business that supports me financially, personally, and spiritually so that I can travel and offer classes and workshops worldwide. This world needs healing, people need healing, communities need healing, and I want to be part of the solution. Your contribution will not only help me live my dreams, it will create a positive ripple effect on the people that are experiencing suffering and ready to make a change.  Selfishly, your contribution will help me expand my business so that I don't have to work as a server clearing dirty plates and dealing with ""the public"" and all their nastiness anymore and I will no longer have to have 12 jobs to stay afloat!  I also would like to share that the long-term plans for Soulrise Movement is to start a non-profit organization that offers classes, workshops, camps &amp; retreats for young underprivileged women that empowers these young women to dream big and live their truth. </p>
<p>Other offerings from Soulrise Movement;</p>
<p>1. FREE online guided audio/video of breathing exercises, meditation, and simple yoga for everyone.</p>
<p>2. Self-enrichment courses on breathing your way to better health, developing and sustaining a morning routine, awakening to your true creative potential, and more!</p>
<p>3. Morning Breath with Kate - a comedic and mildly inappopriate video series offering a variety of different breathing exercises to start your day with, a new special guest every episode. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am the daughter of Railey and Esther Gompah.  Like my father, a former member of the media, I am a filmmaker and actress.  Like my mother, a former hospital staff member into nutrition, I am researched and experienced in methods of health and nutrition and am teaching others. </p>
<p>About 11 years ago, on December 12, 2006, my mother, Esther suffered a debilitating stroke that left her in a wheelchair with limited speech. Through diet, my family has brought her back from several health challenges along the way and would like to see her and others facing challenges like hers have opportunities to participate in their potential recovery in affordable, proven and scientific ways.</p>
<p>Together, we can help to revolutionize the medical industry in this area of rehabilitation as well as save lives that would otherwise be cut short due to lack of information, accessibility and physical decline from atrophy. The brain has been shown to respond to repetition and muscles get stronger with regular use.</p>
<p>What does Moves look like?  It is an everyday gym like any you would see except this one has revolutionary equipment that supports the needs of those with physical challenges.</p>
<p>It provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>Convenient hours of operation</li>
<li>State of the art equipment</li>
<li>Education to make gym usage effective and safe</li>
<li>Training on ways to supplement recovery through diet</li>
<li>Partnerships with likeminded businesses that can further supplement recovery</li>
<li>A community for individuals dedicated to furthering their recovery</li>
</ul>
<p>Members/Staff/How Moves operates</p>
<ul>
<li>Offers memberships to the general physically challenged populations</li>
<li>Offers rentals for people in a specialized case such as to those bedridden</li>
<li>Offers rental space for rehabilitation therapists such as PT, OT and exercise physiologists</li>
<li>Offers rental space for likeminded businesses on location</li>
<li>Sparsely staffed by dedicated employees with the help of interns and volunteers</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>With a goal to open the gym this winter in it's first Los Angeles location, Moves needs $260,000 to effectively begin serving the needs of the community.</p>
<p><strong>This is how those funds will be used:</strong></p>
<p>Equipment Costs              $196,000 Leased/purchased machines, benches, bands, weights</p>
<p>Immediate Staff Needs   $10,000   2 months of operations for 1 full and 1 part-time employee</p>
<p>Start Up/Legal Costs       $11,000    Legal, Computers, Furniture, Basic Facility Preparations</p>
<p>Location Rental                   $18,000   Rental as well as utilities for 4-6 months</p>
<p>Campaign Fees/Taxes      $21,000  Indiegogo processing fees and partial campaign taxes </p>
<p>Perks include ways to commemorate and thank donors, company merchandise and free scholarships to use Moves.</p>
<p>If Moves doesn't reach it's goal, there is still so much we can do. With donations of $10,000 or less Moves will begin with basic start up (website/computers/programs),  legal,  administrative and contractor costs. With $25,000, Moves will open in a smaller facility with 10 of the least expensive leased machines and basic necessary equipment such as benches. With some additional funding as well as experience, Moves will be able to look for and apply for grants and loans to do more.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why Give?</h3>
<p>Moves will begin one way or the other.  Your donations reduce the stress on a start up that is there for the community so that more people can have access to enough machines. Moves will be able to offer necessary scholarships to those in need of them.  The organization can run smoothly with well trained staff and support that  is willing and fulfilled to be a part of it.</p>
<p>America has an epidemic of disability.  From those with brain injuries to those who have lost limbs and abilities through war, accidents or crimes.  This community will only become larger.  We can service the needs in the way we have been doing by offering the minimum or we can vigorously create change and equip as many people as possible in a way that encourages hope, provides a tool and can really lead to longer and more fulfilling, healthier lives</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Right now, Moves is just an idea in the mind's eye of one able bodied woman. I do not imagine that it will be easy. Along with an unknown future that America faces financially and in healthcare, I am not a healthcare professional and I have never run a company of this type and magnitude.  I expect to encounter many obstacles including legal ones.  I also have a fight to take this from just some small company to one that can be included in a list of companies that are setting a better example in this field. I want to see the industry change in a way that more insurance companies would start to be willing to pay for these types of gyms whether as part of a wellness benefit or in some other way. </p>
<p>Inspite of these possibilities and a host of unforeseen ones, I am passionate about this cause.  I, also, feel that I am not a fish out of water in business. I have 10 years experience of running my own companies and worked as a coordinator and in finance in the medical and entertainment fields. In addition, I have years as a teacher, group leader and all around advocate for others.</p>
<p>To minimize and approach obstacles head on, I will have a support team of lawyers, accountants, marketers as well as it is my desire to eventually hire knowledgeable advocates to lead the change, approaching insurance companies, employers and the like to show how rehab gyms benefit their bottom line. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What You Can Do</h3>
<p>Moves needs you to do 3 things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give what you can.  There is no amount too small.</li>
<li>Tell others. Use Indiegogo's share tools to post this campaign directly to social media.</li>
<li>Consider who you can approach directly via phone, email or text.  They can follow these same steps.  Give. Share. Tell another person directly.</li>

<h2>HEALED PEOPLE HEAL PEOPLE.</h2>
<p>We operate a little like Public Radio. We are listener supported. We set a goal of $45,000 for our original campaign and we did not reach it, so we're doing an extension. Please share this. Crowdfunding is not only about the beautiful souls who have supported the music in the past. It is about expanding the listener audience to help us co-create and continue this mission. Send a private message, make a phone call, talk about this over lunch to some of your friends who you know would resonate with this offering. Together we can make this happen. The costs of doing this are high. <i><strong>We really really need you to SUPPORT THE MUSIC THAT SUPPORTS YOU!</strong></i> </p>
<h3>A PERSONAL MESSAGE FROM BOB</h3>
<p>Over the past 6 months, I've questioned - more than ever - my ability to comfortably continue doing this musical work full-time. There are many unknowns and inconsistencies in being a ""do-it-yourself"" musician that make it almost impossible to plan budgets or professionally invest in anything truly necessary to help spread these messages to more than just the 2000 people on our mailing list. That can be very stressful and has caused quite a bit of turmoil in many areas of my life. Part of me can't imagine not doing this full-time; Part of me wants a break!</p>
<p>Every time I get into a downward spiral, ONE OF YOU makes me realize how important this music is to send into the airwaves of humanity. I always say that I write these songs for myself first, because each one is a life lesson or life message for whatever I am experiencing at the time - and often, the lyrics don't even make ""sense"" until I am faced with a future event that makes me recall lyrics that I've sung over and over again yet will carry different significance from that point forward. I don't ""sit down to write a song"". I sit down because the song is ready to speak to and through me. The messages are universal, which is why they touch hearts of so many on so many paths with so many ""differences"".</p>
<p>When we created the original campaign, we looked at so many examples of gadgets and concepts that received well over their intended fundraising goal (this one is mind-boggling because it amazes us that the world believes we need another cell phone to choose from: <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/jelly-the-smallest-4g-smartphone-android/x/8798660#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/jelly-the-smallest-4g-smartphone-android/x/8798660#/</a>). We looked at the expenses that are involved in all of our efforts and - for the first time ever - included promotion and marketing in our crowdfunding goal. We've done two crowdfunding campaigns in the past, and the financial support received covered the new album(s), perks, and all the expenses that went into the creation of products described in the campaign. But it stopped there. There was nothing beyond that to invest in any services that most full-time musicians are able to employ. Creating products is fantastic and fun and exciting, but we need an audience who wants the products in their lives and the lives of their friends and family. Anyone who has been following the music for some time knows that there is plenty of product (we really don't need an 8th album!), but we do have a distribution challenge. We are not reaching audiences without physically being in front of new people, and that keeps us on the road and moving so we aren't able to sink into creating even more expansive programs for you. So we continue to invest in new products to serve the dedicated and loyal fan base who get it and want more, more, more! And for that, there is overflowing gratitude for those sparks of inspiration that allow me to keep on keeping on. </p>
</div><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/pM8G6cSu4S8?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><h3><strong>7 ALBUMS IN 10 YEARS!?</strong></h3><p>Over the 10 years that Bob has been ""making music"", he has transformed as a person. He made personal growth and transformation his passion and it goes hand in hand with the music. </p><p>You might have noticed that the music has evolved - right along with Bob - over these past 10 years and 7 albums. The messages have been getting more potent, more healing, and more resonant with others on the path of transformation and growth. </p><h3><strong>MORE THAN A MUSICIAN (CAN WE GO DEEPER?) </strong></h3><p>The past 3 years Bob embarked on this as a full-time career with support and creative collaboration from Shannon. This is a full-time mission for both of them. Not just for healing themselves but to share their experiences to inspire expansion in others. Bob came to realize that making CDs and playing concerts just wasn’t enough. It wasn’t enough to fully support the mission, but it also wasn’t enough because he really wanted to go deeper with it. To fully explore the medicinal influence of this music. </p><p>Bob and Shannon combined the power of the rich messages of this music with what they found to be impactful self healing and transformational practices that have made a difference in their lives: meditation, breathwork, and working with the energy body (chakras). Shannon integrates her coaching and shamanic practices beautifully into the programs. It resulted in some very powerful workshops and experiences that truly express the full medicinal potency of this music.</p><p>After a few years on the road delivering these workshops to thousands of people, the most common question was, “How do I get a recording of this workshop?” So the wheels started turning...We need to get this work out to the world. </p><h3>WHAT IN THE WORLD IS GOING ON?</h3><p>The energies and vibrations in this world are AMPED UP! It is measurable (google Schumann Resonance if you're interested). People are taking sides, politics is becoming an overheated dinner conversation, personal truths are being challenged, buttons are being pushed. Everyone is just a little on edge. Many of us are hurting. It is a simple truth that, “hurt people, hurt people”. We hurt from our hurt...but conversely, we heal from our healed place. When we address our healing, it ripples into our relationships, workplace, friends, family, community. Healing begets healing. </p><p><strong><i>In response to this, we are embarking on a grand project here!!!!</i> </strong>It is a fundraiser to gather the necessary financial resources to record, produce, and deliver a treasure trove of healing, empowering, and transformational music PLUS experiences and tools for a collective healing to happen during a time in human history where it is really being called forth. </p><h3><strong>WHAT DOES THIS CAMPAIGN INCLUDE? </strong></h3><p>We have so many perks to meet your needs. If you want...</p><ul>
<li>...the new album, we have digital and hard copy perks</li>
<li>...to dive into some meditation practice or experience some of Shannon's shamanic journeying, we have 2 The Movers perks</li>
<li>...all music options including Bob's previous albums, we have 2 The Shakers perks</li>
<li>...to go deeply into experiential online workshop programs, we have 3 The Peacemakers perks</li>
<li>...to host a private concert, consider the Private Concert perk</li>
<li>...to become a Business Sponsor, Ambassador, or Benefactor, there are all kinds of goodies in these perks</li>
</ul><p><i>1- A NEW ALBUM: THE MOVERS, THE SHAKERS &amp; THE PEACEMAKERS</i></p><p>One major component of this campaign is the new album called <i>The Movers, The Shakers &amp; The Peacemakers</i>. How about 12 songs that will touch all aspects of healing? It rocks, it sways, it vibes, and it dances right into your consciousness. This is about stepping up. Stepping into love and peace. Being it and coming forth with a strong sense of peaceful luminous warrior mentality that is so needed at this frenetic time in humanity’s existence.</p><p><strong>(TENTATIVE) Songs on the New Album</strong></p><ol>
<li>The Movers, The Shakers &amp; The Peacemakers</li>
<li>Be Humble Be Hungry Be Love</li>
<li>If Your Hand Was in Mine</li>
<li>Raise the Vibe</li>
<li>The One and Only Song</li>
<li>If You Could See Our Heart</li>
<li>Insignificant Somethings</li>
<li>They Hide It</li>
<li>I’m Beginning to Like the Sound</li>
<li>Healed People</li>
<li>No Mud No Lotus</li>
<li>Something’s Gotta Burn</li>
</ol><p><i>2- MUSIC MEDITATIONS</i></p><p>Imagine combining a soft blanket of songs with meditation for a completely unique and enlightening experience. The songs set you off on a journey and when combined with space for silences and meditation practice, it is a powerful experience for anyone regardless of your expertise (or lack of expertise) in meditation. If you are a seasoned meditator, this series will be a joyful new experience. If you are averse to meditation, unfamiliar, or simply want to learn, this series will open up an entirely new world to you. </p><p><i>3- FULL BODY MUSICAL EXPERIENCE: RELEASE THE AURORA BOREALIS WITHIN</i></p><p>This has been a very popular workshop and so many people have asked for a recording of it. We are so excited to bring this to you. The video below explains it better than words here.

We operate a little like Public Radio. We are listener supported. We set a goal of $45,000 for our original campaign and we did not reach it, so we're doing an extension. Please share this. Crowdfunding is not only about the beautiful souls who have supported the music in the past. It is about expanding the listener audience to help us co-create and continue this mission. Send a private message, make a phone call, talk about this over lunch to some of your friends who you know would resonate with this offering. Together we can make this happen. The costs of doing this are high. We really really need you to SUPPORT THE MUSIC THAT SUPPORTS YOU! 
A PERSONAL MESSAGE FROM BOB
Over the past 6 months, I've questioned - more than ever - my ability to comfortably continue doing this musical work full-time. There are many unknowns and inconsistencies in being a ""do-it-yourself"" musician that make it almost impossible to plan budgets or professionally invest in anything truly necessary to help spread these messages to more than just the 2000 people on our mailing list. That can be very stressful and has caused quite a bit of turmoil in many areas of my life. Part of me can't imagine not doing this full-time; Part of me wants a break!
Every time I get into a downward spiral, ONE OF YOU makes me realize how important this music is to send into the airwaves of humanity. I always say that I write these songs for myself first, because each one is a life lesson or life message for whatever I am experiencing at the time - and often, the lyrics don't even make ""sense"" until I am faced with a future event that makes me recall lyrics that I've sung over and over again yet will carry different significance from that point forward. I don't ""sit down to write a song"". I sit down because the song is ready to speak to and through me. The messages are universal, which is why they touch hearts of so many on so many paths with so many ""differences"".
When we created the original campaign, we looked at so many examples of gadgets and concepts that received well over their intended fundraising goal (this one is mind-boggling because it amazes us that the world believes we need another cell phone to choose from: https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/jelly-the-smallest-4g-smartphone-android/x/8798660#/). We looked at the expenses that are involved in all of our efforts and - for the first time ever - included promotion and marketing in our crowdfunding goal. We've done two crowdfunding campaigns in the past, and the financial support received covered the new album(s), perks, and all the expenses that went into the creation of products described in the campaign. But it stopped there. There was nothing beyond that to invest in any services that most full-time musicians are able to employ. Creating products is fantastic and fun and exciting, but we need an audience who wants the products in their lives and the lives of their friends and family. Anyone who has been following the music for some time knows that there is plenty of product (we really don't need an 8th album!), but we do have a distribution challenge. We are not reaching audiences without physically being in front of new people, and that keeps us on the road and moving so we aren't able to sink into creating even more expansive programs for you. So we continue to invest in new products to serve the dedicated and loyal fan base who get it and want more, more, more! And for that, there is overflowing gratitude for those sparks of inspiration that allow me to keep on keeping on. 
7 ALBUMS IN 10 YEARS!?Over the 10 years that Bob has been ""making music"", he has transformed as a person. He made personal growth and transformation his passion and it goes hand in hand with the music. You might have noticed that the music has evolved - right along with Bob - over these past 10 years and 7 albums. The messages have been getting more potent, more healing, and more resonant with others on the path of transformation and growth. MORE THAN A MUSICIAN (CAN WE GO DEEPER?) The past 3 years Bob embarked on this as a full-time career with support and creative collaboration from Shannon. This is a full-time mission for both of them. Not just for healing themselves but to share their experiences to inspire expansion in others. Bob came to realize that making CDs and playing concerts just wasn’t enough. It wasn’t enough to fully support the mission, but it also wasn’t enough because he really wanted to go deeper with it. To fully explore the medicinal influence of this music. Bob and Shannon combined the power of the rich messages of this music with what they found to be impactful self healing and transformational practices that have made a difference in their lives: meditation, breathwork, and working with the energy body (chakras). Shannon integrates her coaching and shamanic practices beautifully into the programs. It resulted in some very powerful workshops and experiences that truly express the full medicinal potency of this music.After a few years on the road delivering these workshops to thousands of people, the most common question was, “How do I get a recording of this workshop?” So the wheels started turning...We need to get this work out to the world. WHAT IN THE WORLD IS GOING ON?The energies and vibrations in this world are AMPED UP! It is measurable (google Schumann Resonance if you're interested). People are taking sides, politics is becoming an overheated dinner conversation, personal truths are being challenged, buttons are being pushed. Everyone is just a little on edge. Many of us are hurting. It is a simple truth that, “hurt people, hurt people”. We hurt from our hurt...but conversely, we heal from our healed place. When we address our healing, it ripples into our relationships, workplace, friends, family, community. Healing begets healing. In response to this, we are embarking on a grand project here!!!! It is a fundraiser to gather the necessary financial resources to record, produce, and deliver a treasure trove of healing, empowering, and transformational music PLUS experiences and tools for a collective healing to happen during a time in human history where it is really being called forth. WHAT DOES THIS CAMPAIGN INCLUDE? We have so many perks to meet your needs. If you want...
...the new album, we have digital and hard copy perks
...to dive into some meditation practice or experience some of Shannon's shamanic journeying, we have 2 The Movers perks
...all music options including Bob's previous albums, we have 2 The Shakers perks
...to go deeply into experiential online workshop programs, we have 3 The Peacemakers perks
...to host a private concert, consider the Private Concert perk
...to become a Business Sponsor, Ambassador, or Benefactor, there are all kinds of goodies in these perks
1- A NEW ALBUM: THE MOVERS, THE SHAKERS & THE PEACEMAKERSOne major component of this campaign is the new album called The Movers, The Shakers & The Peacemakers. How about 12 songs that will touch all aspects of healing? It rocks, it sways, it vibes, and it dances right into your consciousness. This is about stepping up. Stepping into love and peace. Being it and coming forth with a strong sense of peaceful luminous warrior mentality that is so needed at this frenetic time in humanity’s existence.(TENTATIVE) Songs on the New Album
The Movers, The Shakers & The Peacemakers
Be Humble Be Hungry Be Love
If Your Hand Was in Mine
Raise the Vibe
The One and Only Song
If You Could See Our Heart
Insignificant Somethings
They Hide It
I’m Beginning to Like the Sound
Healed People
No Mud No Lotus
Something’s Gotta Burn
2- MUSIC MEDITATIONSImagine combining a soft blanket of songs with meditation for a completely unique and enlightening experience. The songs set you off on a journey and when combined with space for silences and meditation practice, it is a powerful experience for anyone regardless of your expertise (or lack of expertise) in meditation. If you are a seasoned meditator, this series will be a joyful new experience. If you are averse to meditation, unfamiliar, or simply want to learn, this series will open up an entirely new world to you. 3- FULL BODY MUSICAL EXPERIENCE: RELEASE THE AURORA BOREALIS WITHINThis has been a very popular workshop and so many people have asked for a recording of it. We are so excited to bring this to you. The video below explains it better than words here. It is a life changing experience that will serve to uncover blocks in your ethereal energy body (chakras) and allow for you to experience the music, breath, light, sounds, and intentions in a way that is completely universal yet completely unique to each human being.The online training program will include at least 3-hours of audio and video of both Bob and Shannon guiding you to support this individualized evolution through your energy body. The beauty of this program is that it is your own inner journey. You will find nuggets and feel shifts where you are in that particular moment, every time you sink into the guidance. So the experience - though guided by the same program - is completely different every time.4- PRACTICAL BREATHWORK: SELF HEALING, SELF MASTERY, SELF DISCOVERYA steady personal practice of breathwork will change your life for the better in just about every possible way. It will reverse the negative health effects of a lifetime of stress, reduce anxiety, stave off depression, strengthen your relationships, elevate your ability to deal with emotions, improve your ability to deal with challenging people, change your relationship with food (or other substances), enhance your sleep, and allow a deeper sense of spiritual connection.

Fredric attended The Restaurant School in Philadelphia where he received his Culinary degree and studied in France. After culinary school, his career took off with the opening of four restaurants and ten appearances on the <strong>Food Network.</strong></p>
<p>Along with his years as a well-renowned chef and restaurateur, Fredric brings his Lean and <strong>Six Sigma Black Belt Certifications in manufacturing</strong> to the organization. In 2010, Fredric moved to Phoenix, AZ and began to volunteer at non-profit organizations that serve the homeless, low-income, at risk youth and struggling individuals and families.

Our target goal to get this accomplished is $60,000. This will be used to help fund cultivating and development of the farm site, staffing, community outreach, and educational programming in our flagship market, Camden, NJ. 
We're gaining more support with economic organizations: Beth Filla of the UCEDC, a New Jersey, not-for-profit economic development corporation states “In addition to creating an innovative, locally sourced solution to Camden’s food desert problem, Invincible City Farms will create job opportunities for city residents, including those who are traditionally the least hirable"" 
Even if we don't reach our goal, we never say never, your contribution will still keep Invincible City Farms moving full steam ahead and the project will continue through full development one brick and grain of soil at a time. Our founder, Fredric is a seasoned businessman and community advocate with a successful track record.

Health conscious perks for a healthy & happy you!

Mini-herb garden
Deluxe gardener bag
Earth-friendly designer tote bag and pillows
Fitness tracker bracelet
VIP Invite to the grand opening, dinner and more!

The impact your contribution can have:
Healthy food access projects have the following effects on the community:

Revitalizes the local economy
Creates jobs for those hard to hire.
Improved health outcomes in the community including heart health and nutrition for infants and babies.


Risks & Challenges:
Our efforts in locking in the right property and developer partner is solid. The only risk is not getting the 17-acre dream location and having to scale the farm and community center down to a smaller location based on funding and community partner outreach.

Other Ways You Can Help:
We understand the challenges of wanting to help but struggling with your own personal resources. If you can't contribute, please spread the word about the health and economic impact of food deserts in your local area. You can help in the following ways:


Share our campaign with your community of friends and family.
Stay up to date with food desert issues in America and lobby your local political officials for solutions and resources.
Start your own community farm, garden or Healthy Food Access program in your area.

I was turning 30 and feeling completely lost in my life and purpose. I was struggling with depression. A few months prior, my mom had been diagnosed terminal cancer. I sat down to meditate, and the idea for Lark - everything from the branding to the products - downloaded into me. It was the most intense experience I've ever had. A few years prior I had become obsessed with clean ingredients when I became pregnant with our son, so putting products I'd been working on for years out into the universe seemed only natural. After finishing my meditation I looked over to a tree and a flock of tiny birds flew out. I found out later they were Larks - which is where our name comes from. I went home feeling excited and inspired about something for the first time in years. I got to work right away launching the brand and developing the products. I channeled all my grief and my anger into my work, creating a line of products that are safe, multifunctional and effective. My mom was there cheering me on the in those early stages, and she was so excited to share in what I was doing. </p><p style=""text-align: center;"">My mom passed away in October of 2016.

I mean, that’s a whole lot hot mama’s out there grabbing the nearest thing, ANY thing, to furiously waft over our faces in a futile attempt to alleviate the heat.</p><p>If you’ve ever experienced the unbearable searing sensation of burning up and not being able to cool down, then you know what I mean when I say it feels like you are heating up from the inside out and you feel as though you on FIRE … </p><p>Yet, even though practically half of the world’s ENTIRE population could potentially go through the menopause, in the Western World it is culturally still a taboo subject.  I’ve spoken to many women who are struggling with this perfectly natural yet potentially hellish hormonal journey.  At best they feel like they need to ‘just get on with it’ and at worst they feel like they need to hide their symptoms. And I have felt this way too.</p><p>But not anymore. I intend to embrace the mid-life transition my body is going through and inspire other women to do the same.  We need to own our own ‘too hot to handle’ selves before we can expect anyone else to.</p><p>Fan Fatale is a fierce and feisty hand fan that keeps you cool while looking cool. It’s out with the cutesy, sugary sweet designs of yester-year and in with the sass!  Empowering statements rule. </p><p>The initial design will have the words 'HOT STUFF’ emblazoned across it in bold eye-catching white text across a plain black background. It's meant to be seen. To be noticed. And so are the women who use it. The design is all about embracing our ‘hotness’ while letting everyone know we are done with hiding.  </p><p>Fan Fatale is here to keep us cool … in a much cooler way than ever before. It’s about challenging outdated thinking, busting the myth that menopausal women are past their prime and helping us to be seen.  And sizzle in all our glory.</p><p>By supporting this campaign, you will be helping pave the way for women everywhere.</p><h3><i><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></i></h3><p>I am looking to raise a minimum of $750 so I can place an order of 100 Fan Fatale fans. Each Fan Fatale hand fan is made using 100% eco-friendly black cotton fabric and traditional Japanese folding techniques although it is anything BUT traditional. The words 'HOT STUFF' will adorn each fan in bold white type making them very noticeable. They are not only attention-grabbing, they’re rebelling against the status quo. </p><p>Donations of $10 will be gratefully received and there are additional perks available depending on the level of contribution.  If you sign up to join my campaign mailing list I can keep you up to date and inform you of the campaign’s progress. </p><p>Multiples of 1, 2, 3, 5 or 10 fans are available and as the number of fans ordered increases, so the cost of each fan decreases. </p><p>If I don't reach my target of $750, then every penny raised will be used to bring the fans to market in another way.</p><h3><i><strong>The Impact</strong></i></h3><p>By supporting this campaign, you can say goodbye to the old school, uncool hand fans and say hello to feisty hand fans that look cool whilst keeping you cool. Not only will Fan Fatale alleviate ‘power surges’, it will help us take ownership of our hot bods and embrace all that we are (hot flushes and all), without shame or embarrassment. Just because we're on fire, doesn't mean the menopause should leave us in a hot mess!</p><p>As the fans 'go public' and get used in the real world, it brings with them an opportunity to start a conversation ... funny, serious, emotional or practical ... it will get us women and the people around us talking.  I see these conversations as the start of a movement.  A movement to embrace the changes to our body, and how we and society view the menopause. </p><p>Together we can stop feeling the need to suffer in silence.  We can speak up and be seen.  Remember, age is just a number and even though our bodies are changing, it doesn't mean our femininity, our sassiness, and our joie de vivre has to change too.</p><p>If you have EVER wanted to be a part of something different, or wanted to support women's issues, then this is the campaign for you.  It may have been 100 years since women (in the UK) received the right to vote, but globally we still have a long way to go to ensure we feel comfortable with what it means to be a woman - whatever life stage we’re at.</p><p>Just think how your life and many other women's lives could be changed for the better by buying a Fan Fatale Hand Fan.  Think how many conversations you could start; how many friendships you could make; how many brilliant minds could be brought together to make a real difference. To coin an overused, but prefect phrase ... the possibilities are endless.</p><h3><i><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></i></h3><p>I'm going to be honest.  I have NEVER done anything like this before.  I'm excited, hopeful, but I have to admit, I'm nervous as well. </p><p>Think about it.  Me.  A 51 year old peri-menopausal woman who could potentially break out into a cold sweat and end up looking a hot mess in a micro second, who can’t even remember the names of her own children at times ... doing something she's never done before, involving the wonders of technology and Social Media.  I mean. What could possibly go wrong?</p><p>But I've done my research and I'm feeling positive.</p><p>Some may say I'm mad (harsh but fair); feisty (true); even a rebel without a clue (also true). But I'd say I'm passionate … and someone who really does want to make a difference.</p><h3><i><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></i></h3><p>I know not everyone can make a financial contribution or would like to buy a fan, but if anything resonates with you, whether you're a menopausal woman or not, male or female, young or old, please consider making some noise and sharing this campaign via word of mouth or your own social media channels.  It's as simple as using the Indiegogo share tools. So please.  Dig deep (or shout loud and proud) and take a leap of faith with me. because although the menopause may not affect you personally, it will affect someone you love at some point. And I want society to change for them. For YOU. For me. For every woman. For ever.</p><p> </p></div>","Short SummaryHello.

They are not only attention-grabbing, they’re rebelling against the status quo. Donations of $10 will be gratefully received and there are additional perks available depending on the level of contribution.  If you sign up to join my campaign mailing list I can keep you up to date and inform you of the campaign’s progress. Multiples of 1, 2, 3, 5 or 10 fans are available and as the number of fans ordered increases, so the cost of each fan decreases. If I don't reach my target of $750, then every penny raised will be used to bring the fans to market in another way.The ImpactBy supporting this campaign, you can say goodbye to the old school, uncool hand fans and say hello to feisty hand fans that look cool whilst keeping you cool. Not only will Fan Fatale alleviate ‘power surges’, it will help us take ownership of our hot bods and embrace all that we are (hot flushes and all), without shame or embarrassment. Just because we're on fire, doesn't mean the menopause should leave us in a hot mess!As the fans 'go public' and get used in the real world, it brings with them an opportunity to start a conversation ... funny, serious, emotional or practical ... it will get us women and the people around us talking.  I see these conversations as the start of a movement.  A movement to embrace the changes to our body, and how we and society view the menopause. Together we can stop feeling the need to suffer in silence.  We can speak up and be seen.  Remember, age is just a number and even though our bodies are changing, it doesn't mean our femininity, our sassiness, and our joie de vivre has to change too.If you have EVER wanted to be a part of something different, or wanted to support women's issues, then this is the campaign for you.  It may have been 100 years since women (in the UK) received the right to vote, but globally we still have a long way to go to ensure we feel comfortable with what it means to be a woman - whatever life stage we’re at.Just think how your life and many other women's lives could be changed for the better by buying a Fan Fatale Hand Fan.  Think how many conversations you could start; how many friendships you could make; how many brilliant minds could be brought together to make a real difference. To coin an overused, but prefect phrase ... the possibilities are endless.Risks & ChallengesI'm going to be honest.  I have NEVER done anything like this before.  I'm excited, hopeful, but I have to admit, I'm nervous as well. Think about it.  Me.  A 51 year old peri-menopausal woman who could potentially break out into a cold sweat and end up looking a hot mess in a micro second, who can’t even remember the names of her own children at times ... doing something she's never done before, involving the wonders of technology and Social Media.  I mean. What could possibly go wrong?But I've done my research and I'm feeling positive.Some may say I'm mad (harsh but fair); feisty (true); even a rebel without a clue (also true). But I'd say I'm passionate … and someone who really does want to make a difference.Other Ways You Can HelpI know not everyone can make a financial contribution or would like to buy a fan, but if anything resonates with you, whether you're a menopausal woman or not, male or female, young or old, please consider making some noise and sharing this campaign via word of mouth or your own social media channels.  It's as simple as using the Indiegogo share tools. So please.  Dig deep (or shout loud and proud) and take a leap of faith with me. because although the menopause may not affect you personally, it will affect someone you love at some point. And I want society to change for them. For YOU. For me. For every woman. For ever.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Centre Fanovozantsoa is a privately funded orphanage in Mahajanga, Madagascar, which provides a safe, nurturing place for street kids. Currently housing 21 children, due to space limitations, some of the boys are sleeping two to a bed. The Centre needs major upgrades to the plumbing and electrical, the refrigerator repaired, and lots of storage built for the kitchen. </p>

<p>Named after two victims of human trafficking, Apple Rose Beauty is a 20-year-old dream come true! My love for creating skincare began at age 15 when I analyzed face powder in Chemistry class back in Trinidad and Tobago, where I grew up. I wrote a life-plan then that included starting a cosmetics company one day.</p>
<p>Fast forward 20 years and at the peak of my decade long career in Engineering, Business and Management I left it all behind, selling my home and all my belongings to embark on a year-long mission to travel the world serving the most needy in Central America, Asia and Africa. My work with survivors of human trafficking in Asia changed the trajectory of my life. I returned to the U.S. with a passion to help create opportunities for these survivors.</p>
<p>After intense study and consulting with chemists and formulators in the clean beauty space, my dream came full circle with a much bigger purpose. I combined my heart to serve those in need, my knowledge and love for the health benefits nature affords us and my unapologetic drive for solutions that work, to create Apple Rose Beauty - an unparalleled natural and organic beauty company with a <strong>big heart</strong>.</p>
<p>In addition to providing you with the best that nature has to offer for skin issues such as oily or dry skin, acne, signs of aging and hyperpigmentation, our mission at Apple Rose Beauty, is to employ human trafficking survivors and donate to organizations involved in their rescue and rehabilitation.</p>

<p>To date, we have directly and indirectly, through the 5 Freedom partners we support, impacted the lives of more than 50 women who survived the horrible system of exploitation through human trafficking.</p>
<p>Our goal this year is to employ 3 additional women and support 5 additional organizations on the front lines of rescuing and rehabilitating victims.</p>

<p>Hi there! I’m Keren Eldad, I am a certified Life Coach and I am the founder of With Enthusiasm ™ Life-Coaching<strong>.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>I am on a MISSION. That mission is to help you transform your life and that of thousands of others who will benefit from life coaching through my online coaching courses. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Welcome to the Indie Go Go campaign that will catapult this purpose-driven endeavor into your hands, and those of those people who need my program. </strong></p>
<p><br/>Why? Because it WORKS - and I am living proof that coaching works. Since finding my purpose in coaching, I’ve manifested miracles - from launching the business itself, to manifesting the LOVE OF MY LIFE, with whom I wake up every day. It was not always like this. In 2012, I went through a pretty rough divorce. And in my life, I have struggled with weight problems, financial issues, bouts of unemployment, and more. I have overcome – and so can you.</p>
<p>Following my divorce – my personal rock bottom: I hired one coach. Then another, and then another.  I studied Kabbalah, I went to Landmark, I went to cheesy courses called ""30 Days to Soulmate"" and ""Get Rich for Good"" in which I wrote letters to myself, and hugged my inner child (ugh). I read more than 200 books in the self-help and personal success genre. I discovered, through this what I REALLY, truly want. Then, I went out and got it – by becoming a coach.</p>
<p><br/>The result is With Enthusiasm ™  - the personal coaching programs into which I have distilled all these learnings to serve, counsel, and support you, and to hold you accountable as you create everything you have ever wanted.  We are going to jump start your dream businesses, find your true loves and above all – <strong>help you realize that this world is our one chance to get out there, and go get it. </strong></p>
<p>The first series is called LIVE WITH ENTHUSIASM. It launched in January 2017, and has been bought and downloaded by dozens of superstars. It’s is an online, 7 week course, that includes videos, audio files and worksheets. With it, I train several people at a time to first and foremost shatter their limiting beliefs, and help them walk into new more beneficial thought systems, creating habits to truly transform their lives, and at the very least get them performing at far higher levels.</p>
<p><strong>I am raising $55,000</strong> - the exact amount needed now to first fund my next video series– DATE with Enthusiasm – a 7 week step by step course that will get people into the love life that they deserve, and secondly, to fund the Marketing and Public Relations that my programs require to truly go to the level of similar programs by the world’s biggest coaches – like Tony Robbins, Brendan Burchard, Marie Forleo and Jen Sincero. There is no doubt in my mind that my programs are of the same ilk, and are every bit as capable of reaching people with their message.</p>
<p><strong>Perks:</strong> When you donate $400 (or more) - you will automatically get the link to download the full online version of Live With Enthusiasm!</p>
</div><div><h3><strong>If the goal is not met - the impact will still be massive! Date with Enthusiasm - the second online coaching program - will see light. Countless people will find new levels of joy. And we will just continue to move, steadily, towards our goals in a phased approach.</strong></h3></div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact thus far</h3>
<p>Since launching my first online program 5 months ago, I’ve seen one student get engaged at the age of 57, one finally prepare his company for sale so that he can pursue Olympic dreams, and helped several finally find the courage to forgive their moms, launch their dream consulting business, and just live more fully than ever before. The testimonials – from just these FOUR MONTHS - are absolutely outstanding, and you are more than welcome to check some of them out on <a href=""http://www.kereneldad.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.kereneldad.com</a>.</p>
<p>The point here is not just traction – validation for ME – but validation for you, for your investment. Funding my business is not just sound, but is supporting the the vehicle for the inspiration of masses of people.</p>
<p>You see, everyone needs this. Everyone needs inspiration, motivation, connection and support. Particularly during these times of constant phone gazing, unprecedented levels of single-hood, of financial strife, and of global misalignment. We need people vibing high, creating and spreading kindness. It literally benefits everyone.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Once a little-known vocation, <strong>life coaching is gaining traction</strong>– in part thanks to mega- high profile coaches such as Tony Robbins, and in part just thanks to technology and the times. According to projections by the Bureau of Labor Studies, <strong>the consulting services industry is responsible for the majority of employment growth in professional and business services - and is now a multi billion dollar industry. </strong>This means lots of opportunity -- but also, lots of competition. So - why With Enthusiasm? </p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h2>Background</h2><p>Swaziland is a kingdom in Southern Africa where the majority of the population lives in rural areas, supporting themselves through small businesses and subsistence farming. Swaziland has one of the highest rates of HIV infection in the world, with 28.8% of the adult population living with HIV (<a href=""http://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/2016-prevention-gap-report_en.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">UNAIDS Gap Report, 2016)</a>. This has led to a loss of a whole generation (38% of the population were under the age of 15 years (<a href=""http://www.who.int/gho/countries/swz.pdf?ua=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">WHO, 2015</a>)), and break down in family structures. Swazi’s also face the challenges associated with widespread poverty with an estimated 63% of the population living below the poverty line (<a href=""http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/swaziland/overview"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">World Bank, 2016</a>). Additionally, there are high rates of domestic and gender based violence. In Swaziland one in three women report experiencing some form of abuse by the time they are 18 years old (<a href=""http://www.uneca.org/sites/default/files/uploaded-documents/Beijing20/NationalReviews/swaziland_beijing_review_report.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">UNECA, 2014</a>).</p><p>These challenges take a toll on the nation’s mental health, with many people experiencing grief, loss, depression, anxiety and financial stress. A lack of finances, a shortage of trained professionals and stigma act as barriers to accessing support. There is a need to improve awareness around mental health and develop culturally appropriate psychosocial resources. </p><p> </p><h2>Our dream</h2><p>Duduza’s dream is to set up a safe space to offer three different services to the local population. The first is to offer direct mental health and psychosocial support services by bringing professionals together to provide holistic care. The second is to build capacity within the country by offering training and workshops on varied mental health and psychosocial support topics to different groups, organisations and companies. We have noticed a growing interest among Swazi's to pursue careers in mental health and an increase in the number of people studying psychology. Therefore as part of building local capacity, Duduza would like support this interest and provide young professionals a space to learn and grow under the mentorship of more experienced health care workers. The third service is to conduct high quality research on mental health and wellbeing in Swaziland, in order to identify needs, empower vulnerable groups and give Swaziland a voice in regional and global mental health discussions.</p><p> </p><h2>The challenge</h2><p>To make this dream a reality – we need a physical place that will be Duduza’s home. Although Duduza has begun to provide some services, without a place to operate from we cannot grow to meet the needs of the community. We have found a property, nestled at the base of Sibebe rock, which offers a peaceful space from which we can provide all three of these services. It is welcoming, discrete and accessible to the general public.</p><p><br/>With the money raised through this campaign, we are hoping to buy this property and bring Duduza to life. We will be competing in the property market, so if we are not able to obtain this particular property we will look for another suitable location.</p><p> </p><h2>We need your support</h2><p>Duduza’s dream can only be realized with your support! This can be both financial, or by spreading the word!

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>National LGBT Cancer Network and Films for Nonprofits have teamed up before. We've made 6 successful films that show the lives and healthcare needs of LGBT people. But nothing prepared us for the viral impact of Vanessa Goes to the Doctor. We hit upon a formula, based on humor and compelling filmmaking that goes straight to the viewer's heart. Healthcare professionals find themselves laughing as they grow to care about Vanessa, a transgender woman of color, and accompany her to her first visit to a new doctor. </p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>People Are Asking For More.</h3>
<p>In response to these requests for better healthcare by the LGBT community we are now seeking funding to make <i>Vanessa </i>the first in a <strong><u>series</u> </strong>of short films, each covering a different LGBT subpopulation and distinct medical specialty:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:41.6pt;"">Film #2: <strong><i>Jack </i></strong><i>(a bisexual man) <strong>Goes to the Psychiatrist</strong></i></p>

<p style=""margin-left:41.6pt;"">Film #4: <strong><i>Jeffrey </i></strong><i>(a gay man) <strong>Goes to His Primary Care Physician</strong></i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:5.6pt;"">Each film will employ the same lighthearted but profoundly serious approach and will be produced by the same team that created <i>Vanessa</i>. Once completed, the films will be widely distributed through the broad social media and professional affiliations of the National LGBT Cancer Network. The films will all be available for free.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>There have been many amazing attempts to shed some light on body positivity.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
There have been many amazing attempts to shed some light on body positivity.
However, there seems to be a lack of proportional representation of the whole population: men, women, and transgender people of all races, ages, and body types.
There is power and strength in seeing accurate, realistic representations of ourselves in media.
Body 365 features people stripped down or as covered up as they would like to be, highlighting how perfect our perceived flaws and imperfections truly are via photo and video in a style that is similar to that of Humans of New York.

This is NOT for school credit and we are NOT selling a product, what we are doing is creating a movement for all of us to showcase the bodies we have in a loving manner. There is not a single person who can say that they've never had an insecurity when it comes to their body, now let's embrace our so called ""flaws"" as we are perfect just the way we are.

<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p>The husband &amp; wife team are <a href=""https://www.howareyoureally.yoga/about-us"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Larry &amp; Sarah Mckenzie-Thane</a>. After leaving the UK almost 5 years ago we have been living in various parts of Indonesia. Before settling here we travelled through many parts of Asia acquiring many experiences and qualifications in various types of Yoga, Meditation, Reiki, Sound Healing, Ayurveda and many other wellness tools. We have also gained relevant skills in Hotel, Restaurant and Yoga Centre management.</p>
<h3>What is 'How are you Really? Yoga Retreats'?</h3>
<p>Our ocean-side retreats have been specifically designed for everyone regardless of experience, age or gender! We guide our guests through different styles of Yoga - <i>Hatha, Vinyasa, Fly-High and Yin</i> to help with the physical self. We also help discover other techniques for the mind such as <i>meditation, breath-work, mindfulness &amp; even adult colouring</i>! Exploring the <i>Chakras &amp; Ayurveda</i> also helps deepen the understanding of what makes us who we are! We want to create a space where guests can come to relax, rewind and restore using self love, self indulgence and self discovery techniques.</p>

<h3>What We Need...</h3>
<p>We have discovered a beautiful hotel in a small corner of the tropical island of Bali in Indonesia that has the vibrance and energy worthy of a Retreat Centre. This wonderful place is in Candidasa, a small town on the East coast of Bali. The hotel has 6 small cottages, a restaurant and a huge unspoilt garden with a potential for expansion. At the foot of the garden is the beach and ocean which is a snorkelers  paradise.</p>
<p>We already have excited investors and along with our own funds we just need $20,000USD to build a Shala and refurbish the cottages... this is where we need your help!</p>

<h3>Testimonials</h3>
<p>""<i>Loved Sarah and Larry. The yoga was great and not to complicated for beginners. Lots of laughter, great food and friends I hope I'll have for life. It was perfect I came back so relaxed and feel I have a different attitude.</i>"" - <strong>Natalie McWilliams. Australia.</strong></p>
<p><i>""This was an incredible week. It was an amazing mix of people who all contributed to the experience and it was great to have an open and compassionate environment where we felt safe to share. Sarah, you, coming from a place of being curious, compassionate, supportive and open made this experience magical.</i>"" - <strong>Mylene, France.</strong></p>
<p><i>""Sarah and Larry are two of the nicest people I've ever met and I loved that they really got involved with the group during outings, meals etc. It made it feel like a real little family. The free time is a perfect way to chill out, have a little holiday or really get to know others in the group. Honestly, one of the best weeks of my life. I'm going away literally a different person with a new found spark and passion for life that I haven't felt in years!"" - </i><strong>Kate, U.K.</strong></p>
<p>""<i>Sarah has a great approach to teaching &amp; an excellent interaction with her students. A very fresh approach. She's a refreshing breeze that brings light into a traditional Yoga practice. I highly recommend her teaching &amp; classes</i>"" - <strong>Panda Chi, India</strong></p>
<p>""<i>Great Yoga Retreat Sarah is a phenomenal yoga teacher and just a beautiful person inside and out. The theme ""How are you Really"" was spot on. Sarah and Larry made sure that you had time for introspection pondering that question. The retreat schedule was great. We learned a lot about yoga, chakra's, auyervdic practices, yin yoga and yoga nidra. The excursions to the water palace and mountain Shaman were interesting and informative about the local Balinese culture. The class participants were literally from around the globe. We bonded and shared a lot of laughs and even a few tears as we learned about ourselves and each other.</i>"" - <strong>Monica Penrose, CA. USA</strong></p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We believe that we have the relevant skills to run a successful <strong>How are you Really? Yoga Retreat Centre</strong>. We already operate our Yoga Retreats in the area so we are aware of any problems that could possibly arise. We also intend to employ the existing staff that already work at the hotel to help us with the general running.</p>
<p>As a very last resort, this is obviously worse case scenario, we can turn it back into a hotel and operate it as such. Of course if you pledged you will still get your perk but with our existing Yoga Retreat.</p>
<p>Obviously we hope to reach our goal but should we fall short we can still use the donated money to build the Yoga Shala... or just pay for the much needed refurbishment... it will just take a little longer to complete the rest of our <strong>'Dream Yoga retreat Centre'!</strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Its ok if you cannot support us financially, we still love you!</p>
<p>We will love you even more though if you can share our page and tell all of your friends &amp; family about our exciting project. By using Indiegogo's sharing tools you can involve other people because it is a great way to expand our little planet and sharing with others is a giant step towards elevating our dream into a reality!</p>

<h3>The heart behind the mission:</h3>
<p>Connectedness is something we tend to forget is in our nature. Throughout our life, we can be stripped away from the truth that resides in all of us. We desire silence, healing, love, inspiration, and most importantly, an understanding of our purpose here on this Earth. The heart that had a vision and desire to not only constantly remind themselves, but others, was inspired by a moment we as people have all reached. A feeling that something deeper was guiding them to heal not only themselves, but future generations that will call us ancestors. </p>
<h3>Funding the movement:</h3>
</div><div><ul>
<li>With the $3,000 goal, we plan to use $1,500 for seeking the most credible products to ensure each month we provide the tools you need to heal and ground you through your spiritual journey. Sourcing products that have the purest intentions, while also giving the artist and creators the abundance they need to keep creating. The other $1,500 will be used for the logistics of packaging, and sending the most divine and conscious gift to your home. Promising supporters that we are using the most environmentally friendly packaging, and shipping we are able to find. </li>
<li>When you donate to our mission, the first 25 donors will receive the a one month free subscription as a thank you, and all donors after that will receive a surprise altar gift. </li>
<li>Even if we are not able to reach our entire goal, the funds we do bring in will be focused and used for sourcing credible products and ensuring we pay every artist/vendor for their intentions and work. </li>
</ul></div><div>
<h3>Our Promise:</h3>
<p>This mission goes deeper than just someone starting a business. It's about connecting and keeping others in their truth. We want to give the world hope and inspiration, and remind others there is purpose here for all of us when we slow down and trust in our hearts.  No matter where you're at in your journey, it's our goal to make sure you have the constant love and support you need when life gets too loud. We hope you are able to give us that opportunity, and open the portal to receiving/giving.</p>
<p>Divine Delivery has so many goals to constantly give new ways for others to discover, heal, love and be inspired. This subscription service is truly just the beginning.

<p>We are Rodolfo and Giorgio, two medical doctors with the <i>ambition to change and impact the world where no one dares to</i>. During our formation as medical doctors, we took part in several medical volunteering programs <i>across the globe</i> like Ghana, Zambia, Palestine, United States of America, Spain and Mexico. We realized that we had to tackle real life challenges, not only in our country, but around the world, and make a <i>real impact in third world societies.</i> That’s why we decided to create the <u><strong>Medical Impact Volunteer Group.</strong></u></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>WHAT IS IT?</strong></u></p>
<p><strong>It is a  new international challenge and opportunity for medical students and physicians to discover a brand new world, where they can gain a lot of human and medical experience while taking care and living in the poorest communities around the world.

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><strong>Zara Jeffrey</strong></i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i> <strong>Co Founder/ Co Ceo/Creative Director of Urban Light Mobile Wellness</strong></i><i><strong> and Urban Light Sanctuary LLC.</strong></i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> Healing has always been powerful and fascinating to me. What drives my passion to share it with others, is that I have experienced it within my own body and life and seen many positive changes. We are all different, we are all individual and need our own set of tools that work for our own unique experience of life.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Many years ago, I knew I would one day open a wellness center in San Diego. Urban Light Mobile Wellness is the incarnation of that dream. It is with great love and joy that Johanna and I bring Urban Light Mobile Wellness to the masses.

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Here is a brief overview of my training. In 2004, I graduated from San Diego State University with my Bachelors of Arts in Dance. This study took me on a deep exploration within my body, mind and spirit.  In 2008, I attended Mueller College for Massage Therapy, this program gave me tools to help others clear blockages through healing touch and intuition. I began working as a LMT in 2010 at San Diego Center for Health.   In 2013, I reconnected with yoga once again creating a shift in my life, and bringing my entrepreneurial spirit to life.

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><strong>Johanna Karlsson</strong></i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><strong>Co founder/ Co Ceo of Urban Light Mobile Wellness and  Urban Light Sanctuary LLC.</strong></i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">My journey into the wellness field started about 10 years ago by chance (or not, depending on how you see it!). I was completely unhappy in my job, I hold a master’s degree in European Political Affairs and I was working in the nonprofit sector. I was good at my job, but I was not excited to go to work and I felt like I was on the wrong track. Around the same time, a friend introduced me to Reiki and that experience profoundly changed my mindset surrounding health and healing. From that moment on, I was drawn into the healing arts. Shortly afterwards,  I applied to Mueller College of Holistic Studies to further my understanding of the human mind and body. I graduated in 2010 with a degree in holistic health and massage therapy. I have been working in the field ever since and not once have I regretted taking the leap. I am now taking another leap - one that feels equally exciting and exhilarating. Urban Light Mobile Wellness has been a beautiful dream in the back of my mind ever since I started massage school. Now, it is reality.  It is very much a labor of LOVE for both Zara and I.  My heartfelt wish for is that we touch our clients with the same love and sense of purpose that I feel for my family and my life.</p>
<h3>Our Plan</h3>
<p>Urban Light Mobile Wellness is a <strong>State of the Art Remodeled Travel Trailer Unit</strong> operating at corporate hubs in and around San Diego. <strong>We offer a complete wellness experience!</strong></p>
<p> We have two comfortable treatment rooms, equipped to provide all our clients with the highest level of comfort. We also have chair massage as standard. We offer customized massage in a variety of styles and running from 30-60 minutes based on clients needs and wants. <i><strong>Convenience</strong></i>,<i><strong> easy access</strong></i>, and <strong><i>affordability </i></strong>are <i><strong>key to our business model.</strong></i>  <i><strong>Our i</strong></i><i><strong>ntention is to break stress cycles for every individual in order to maximize peak performance, while making your experience affordable and fulfilling.</strong></i></p>
<p>The problem we intend to solve is straightforward. Corporate America is traditionally associated with stress, deadlines, and long hours. Whereas as changing any of that would be a miracle, what our wellness trailer can offer is magical. <i><strong>We enhance the quality of life for corporate America by reducing emotional and physical stress, anxiety, and work related muscular tension by providing onsite massage therapy.</strong></i> </p>
<p>Business people are busy people, with little down time or free time. Many can never find time for themselves, resulting in little to no self-care. We are programmed to rush to the next meeting or push through till the next deadline. Any thought about ourselves and our needs are cast aside or forgotten about. Over time, our self-neglect starts to affect our performance at work. This trend costs companies thousands of dollars annually.<i> <strong>According to an article in a 2002 edition of Financial Times, an Ontario company reported a 25% reduction in time off for work related injuries and compensation claims dropped by $200,000 after implementing a massage therapy program.</strong></i></p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need?</h3>
<p><strong>Expenses so far</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>cost of trailer = $4,000</strong></li>
<li><strong>rental storage fee = $110 per month x 12 months = $1,350</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Budget for operations of unit start up</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>renovation expenses (parts and labor) = $30,000</strong></li>
<li><b>customized mobile booking system by Sterling Mobile = $8000 upfront + $350 monthly</b></li>
<li><strong>permits/ licensing/insurance=  $600/per month</strong></li>
<li><b>marketing and advertising = $10,000</b></li>
<li><b>misc = $10,000</b></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Total budget to get the project off the ground and rolling</strong></p>
<ul><li>
<strong>$​100,000 total cost to cover all expenses for start-up </strong>​</li></ul>
<p><strong>We intend to have this project fully funded at the end of this Campaign run!; However if we don't get fully funded, we will use the funds we do raise to continue to move forward on the buildout of the trailer, as well as, continue to research all avenues and options for additional funding to bring Urban Light Mobile Wellness to life. We are confident in our venture.</strong></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The essence of this project and what we truly envision for our company is to create a tangible change in how people perceive their personal wellness. We want to <strong><i>increase people’s general wellbeing and help the masses recognize the importance of proactive self-care. </i></strong>The intention is to create a space during someone’s workday when he or she can quickly step out of their office and get a massage, which in turn will, <strong><i>boost productivity,</i></strong> <strong><i>reduce sick leave, </i></strong>and <strong><i>increase general wellbeing.     </i></strong></p>
<p>We all are trying to find the <i><strong>balance between </strong></i>our <i><strong>work schedules, family time, self-care time, and time to just enjoy life.</strong></i> Our fast paced society and reliance on technology has created a disconnection from our bodies, so it is of the utmost importance that we find ways to reconnect and to live in Ease and not Dis-ease.  <i><strong>Our services provide an easy solution by integrating holistic wellness into the work day by bringing it on-site to your company or event through our mobile/ modular platform. </strong></i> We know people need it, and we know people want it, because ultimately we all want to <i><strong>enjoy our lives</strong></i>, and in order to do that we have to <strong>be alive</strong>,  <strong>and well in our bodies.</strong> We are asking for your support to create change and create peace and ease within a world that works so hard.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p><i><strong>Regulatory Restriction:</strong></i><br/>Based on our business model the city of San Diego only allows us to operate on private property. Consequently, we aim to negotiate contracts with owners of corporate buildings in order to be able to offer services at their location. To facilitate this process, we currently consult with the CEO of Sterling Mobile Enterprises, a company offering mobile barbering services in the same manner we are proposing to offer massage and chiropractic care. This company has created a blueprint for every aspect of the business model spanning from the physical set-up of trailer on site to the negotiation process of corporate contracts and everything in between. Working with this company saves us a tremendous amount of time and money up front.</p>
<p><i><strong>Competition:</strong></i><br/><i><strong>Current Alternatives</strong></i><br/>As far as actual competition, there is<i><strong> currently no other company doing exactly what we are setting out to do</strong></i>. However, there are some competitors, these companies commonly provide corporate massage and yoga by setting up physical shop inside a particular company office. These wellness companies are usually limited to working with one company at the time. <i><strong>By having our own state of the art facility located in the center of a corporate hub with multiple businesses present, we can reach all of them at the same time instead of limiting ourselves to working with only one company at the time.</strong></i></p>
<p><strong><i>Our Advantages</i></strong><br/>One of Urban Light Mobile Wellness's <i><strong>key advantages is geographic reach</strong></i>. We are <i><strong>on location,</strong></i><i><strong> outside of corporate centers for everyone to see</strong></i>. <i><strong>We reach all the companies </strong></i>in that particular building, <i><strong>instead of being limited to working with one</strong></i> company at the time inside their office. <i><strong>Another</strong></i> <i><strong>key advantage of our model is our booking system</strong></i>. <i><strong>The system is developed based on a multiple locations principle and with a complex backend mechanism making marketing and client outreach streamlined with the purpose of rebooking clients and making it known where we are located at any given </strong></i><strong><i>day.</i></strong></p>

The problem we intend to solve is straightforward. Corporate America is traditionally associated with stress, deadlines, and long hours. Whereas as changing any of that would be a miracle, what our wellness trailer can offer is magical. We enhance the quality of life for corporate America by reducing emotional and physical stress, anxiety, and work related muscular tension by providing onsite massage therapy. 
Business people are busy people, with little down time or free time. Many can never find time for themselves, resulting in little to no self-care. We are programmed to rush to the next meeting or push through till the next deadline. Any thought about ourselves and our needs are cast aside or forgotten about. Over time, our self-neglect starts to affect our performance at work. This trend costs companies thousands of dollars annually. According to an article in a 2002 edition of Financial Times, an Ontario company reported a 25% reduction in time off for work related injuries and compensation claims dropped by $200,000 after implementing a massage therapy program.
What Will You Help Create?
 



 
What We Need?
Expenses so far

cost of trailer = $4,000
rental storage fee = $110 per month x 12 months = $1,350

Budget for operations of unit start up

renovation expenses (parts and labor) = $30,000
customized mobile booking system by Sterling Mobile = $8000 upfront + $350 monthly
permits/ licensing/insurance=  $600/per month
marketing and advertising = $10,000
misc = $10,000

Total budget to get the project off the ground and rolling

$​100,000 total cost to cover all expenses for start-up ​
We intend to have this project fully funded at the end of this Campaign run!; However if we don't get fully funded, we will use the funds we do raise to continue to move forward on the buildout of the trailer, as well as, continue to research all avenues and options for additional funding to bring Urban Light Mobile Wellness to life. We are confident in our venture.
The Impact
The essence of this project and what we truly envision for our company is to create a tangible change in how people perceive their personal wellness. We want to increase people’s general wellbeing and help the masses recognize the importance of proactive self-care. The intention is to create a space during someone’s workday when he or she can quickly step out of their office and get a massage, which in turn will, boost productivity, reduce sick leave, and increase general wellbeing.     
We all are trying to find the balance between our work schedules, family time, self-care time, and time to just enjoy life. Our fast paced society and reliance on technology has created a disconnection from our bodies, so it is of the utmost importance that we find ways to reconnect and to live in Ease and not Dis-ease.  Our services provide an easy solution by integrating holistic wellness into the work day by bringing it on-site to your company or event through our mobile/ modular platform.  We know people need it, and we know people want it, because ultimately we all want to enjoy our lives, and in order to do that we have to be alive,  and well in our bodies. We are asking for your support to create change and create peace and ease within a world that works so hard.
Risks & Challenges
Regulatory Restriction:Based on our business model the city of San Diego only allows us to operate on private property. Consequently, we aim to negotiate contracts with owners of corporate buildings in order to be able to offer services at their location. To facilitate this process, we currently consult with the CEO of Sterling Mobile Enterprises, a company offering mobile barbering services in the same manner we are proposing to offer massage and chiropractic care. This company has created a blueprint for every aspect of the business model spanning from the physical set-up of trailer on site to the negotiation process of corporate contracts and everything in between. Working with this company saves us a tremendous amount of time and money up front.
Competition:Current AlternativesAs far as actual competition, there is currently no other company doing exactly what we are setting out to do. However, there are some competitors, these companies commonly provide corporate massage and yoga by setting up physical shop inside a particular company office. These wellness companies are usually limited to working with one company at the time. By having our own state of the art facility located in the center of a corporate hub with multiple businesses present, we can reach all of them at the same time instead of limiting ourselves to working with only one company at the time.
Our AdvantagesOne of Urban Light Mobile Wellness's key advantages is geographic reach. We are on location, outside of corporate centers for everyone to see. We reach all the companies in that particular building, instead of being limited to working with one company at the time inside their office. Another key advantage of our model is our booking system. The system is developed based on a multiple locations principle and with a complex backend mechanism making marketing and client outreach streamlined with the purpose of rebooking clients and making it known where we are located at any given day.

<p>DeColonaise was founded by members of the African  National Women's Organization who desired to create all natural products that were beneficial for our hair, bodies and minds. It was important for us to create a brand that promotes images of  beautiful African People in all our diverse forms. Decolonaise is ""A Revolution for your Hair and Body"" because along with providing all natural organic products we seek to educate and empower colonized people by combating colonialism and its effects on African People globally.</p>
<p>DeColonaise is an economic development project that will help fund the work of the African National Women’s Organization (ANWO). ANWO was founded in 2015, by the African People’s Socialist Party, to  address the special oppression African Women face everyday. ANWO is dedicated to supporting and inspiring African women and to be leaders in the struggle against colonialism.

</div></div>","DeColonaise was founded by members of the African  National Women's Organization who desired to create all natural products that were beneficial for our hair, bodies and minds. It was important for us to create a brand that promotes images of  beautiful African People in all our diverse forms. Decolonaise is ""A Revolution for your Hair and Body"" because along with providing all natural organic products we seek to educate and empower colonized people by combating colonialism and its effects on African People globally.
DeColonaise is an economic development project that will help fund the work of the African National Women’s Organization (ANWO). ANWO was founded in 2015, by the African People’s Socialist Party, to  address the special oppression African Women face everyday. ANWO is dedicated to supporting and inspiring African women and to be leaders in the struggle against colonialism.

<p><b>About From Fear To Courage. </b></p>
<p>From Fear To Courage is a documentary on the life of Simon Lee, a 30 year veteran as a mentor, healer and coach. It portrays how he went from feeling lost and broken as a child, to uncovering courage within himself and later encouraged and taught the same to countless men and boys in need of help, direction and purpose. He has dealt with extreme cases of serious addictions, graphic self harming and overcoming attempted suicides. He also helps issues such as restoring connections within families. He is highly experienced in applied practical philosophy, physical movement and nutrition. These three elements combined overcome depression, anxiety and stress. He has delivered a key note speech for a high profile mental health charity, presented to blue chip companies, conducts group and 121 coaching and is writing his book, on the subject of this film, to be published after the film release. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1582045383/arurmaogf51qe0utec2c.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The story follows Simons' difficult childhood and how being an observer to the abuse of his sister sent him into a spiral of self hatred, hopelessness and anxiety. It continues through to how he healed himself and formed a unique approach to healing the minds of others. </p>
<p>This documentary will be controversial, powerful, thought provoking and heart wrenching. It is a study of a society that is becoming devoid of fathers and positive male role models and how this is resulting in all sexes and elements of society losing out. </p>
<p>It is set to become one of the most powerful depictions of childhood stress and how this often defines our life as adults.</p>
<p><b>Why is this film being made now?</b></p>
<p>We feel this documentary is vital that it is seen and an absolute necessity in its timing. Mental health issues in adults and children have become an epidemic. Male suicide rates in particular are having a huge impact on families across America and the UK and having a catastrophic effect on society. We have normalised disconnection and it’s killing people. No one knows what to do and the approaches to this worrying issue are not working. The conversation needs to change. Responsibility needs to be taken by elements of society that are making the situation worse. The time has come to highlight an issue that many are too afraid to acknowledge. </p>
<p>Our contributors can help us spread a message so powerful that it can literally change entire societies. Ultimately it’s a message of unconditional love and how uncovering this in ourselves can heal everyone around us. <br/> </p>
<p><b>The Director </b></p>
<p>Julian Grant is a British writer and director, actor and producer. Starting out late in life as an actor, he found his passion was behind the camera rather than in front of it. The idea of having other actors act out his quirky screen-plays seemed appealing to him. He was once quoted as saying."" To Ponder over what could be is a sin, but to create something from thin air is a gift, so why not share it with others.” <br/>Julian has a particular interest in this project due to his own struggles as a child. <br/> </p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Welcome to the Furry Friends for Senior Citizens campaign! We are a group of students from the University of Tennessee and we teamed up with the Anderson County Animal Rescue Foundation (ACARF) to raise money for For the Love of Pets Food Pantry. Based at the Senior Center in Clinton, Tennessee, this is a program that is raising money to provide low income seniors with pet food, supplies, and preventatives. Some senior citizens sacrifice their own needs to keep their pets while others are faced with giving up their pets because they are unable to provide for them. Because of this their beloved pet ends up at the shelter. This needs-based program helps keep people and their companion animals together. Therefore, we need YOUR help to help raise funds and generate campaign success! We greatly appreciate your contributions in changing the lives of many seniors and their pets!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Goal</h3>
<p>Over the next couple of months, we are attempting to raise $1,200 to support seniors who are unable to provide care for their pets. These funds will go directly to ACARF, specifically towards the For the Love of Pets Food Pantry program. This amount will insure that these pets have long and fulfilling lives, despite their owners’ financial struggles. With your help, we can reach our goal and create lifelong memories for both owners and pets.</p>
<h3>About ACARF</h3>
</div><div><p>ACARF is a registered non-profit animal rescue organization located in Anderson County TN. ACARF’s mission statement is, “Anderson County Animal Rescue Foundation will aspire to promote humane treatment of animals in Anderson County. We will Advocate responsible companion animal ownership through educational programs, and strive to increase public awareness of the need and value of community involvement and responsibility for public and animal welfare. We will provide a safe environment for unwanted, stray, abused or abandoned animals, with the goal of finding loving ‘forever’: homes for homeless animals”. They function solely with the help of dedicated animal loving volunteers. They believe that our companion animals for life, and just as no person should go hungry or homeless, neither should their pets go hungry or given up due to lack of food. For the Love of Pets Food Pantry is sustained solely by donations, and all donations go directly to seniors and their pets.</p></div><div>
<h3>Why Should You Care?</h3>
<p>For many senior citizens, a dog or cat is more than a pet. They are family members that provide companionship. Studies have shown that pets lower illness levels and mortality rates. Unfortunately, caring for a pet can be difficult when living on a fixed income at or under the poverty level. On average it takes roughly $1,500 annually to care for a pet’s basic food and medical expenses, completely ignoring any other miscellaneous costs that will come up. Approximately 6.5 million companion animals enter U.S. animal shelters nationwide every year because their owners were unable to financially support them. In addition, each year, approximately 1.5 million shelter animals are euthanized (670,000 dogs and 860,000 cats). The number of dogs and cats euthanized in U.S. shelters annually has declined from approximately 2.6 million in 2011. If owners had funds to care for their pets’ health needs, these numbers would drastically decrease. This campaign can go a long way in helping people and pets in need. Also, there are many perks available for varying levels of giving.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The Furry Friends for Senior Citizens and ACARF provides life changing support people and pets in need, offering them a chance to improve their situations. If you want to make a change in the Anderson County community, please consider donating to our campaign. Please spread the word about this campaign to your family and friends by sharing on all media platforms! With donors, supporters, and volunteers like you, we can make a difference!

Some senior citizens sacrifice their own needs to keep their pets while others are faced with giving up their pets because they are unable to provide for them. Because of this their beloved pet ends up at the shelter. This needs-based program helps keep people and their companion animals together. Therefore, we need YOUR help to help raise funds and generate campaign success! We greatly appreciate your contributions in changing the lives of many seniors and their pets!

The Goal
Over the next couple of months, we are attempting to raise $1,200 to support seniors who are unable to provide care for their pets. These funds will go directly to ACARF, specifically towards the For the Love of Pets Food Pantry program. This amount will insure that these pets have long and fulfilling lives, despite their owners’ financial struggles. With your help, we can reach our goal and create lifelong memories for both owners and pets.
About ACARF
ACARF is a registered non-profit animal rescue organization located in Anderson County TN. ACARF’s mission statement is, “Anderson County Animal Rescue Foundation will aspire to promote humane treatment of animals in Anderson County. We will Advocate responsible companion animal ownership through educational programs, and strive to increase public awareness of the need and value of community involvement and responsibility for public and animal welfare. We will provide a safe environment for unwanted, stray, abused or abandoned animals, with the goal of finding loving ‘forever’: homes for homeless animals”. They function solely with the help of dedicated animal loving volunteers. They believe that our companion animals for life, and just as no person should go hungry or homeless, neither should their pets go hungry or given up due to lack of food. For the Love of Pets Food Pantry is sustained solely by donations, and all donations go directly to seniors and their pets.
Why Should You Care?
For many senior citizens, a dog or cat is more than a pet. They are family members that provide companionship. Studies have shown that pets lower illness levels and mortality rates. Unfortunately, caring for a pet can be difficult when living on a fixed income at or under the poverty level. On average it takes roughly $1,500 annually to care for a pet’s basic food and medical expenses, completely ignoring any other miscellaneous costs that will come up. Approximately 6.5 million companion animals enter U.S. animal shelters nationwide every year because their owners were unable to financially support them. In addition, each year, approximately 1.5 million shelter animals are euthanized (670,000 dogs and 860,000 cats). The number of dogs and cats euthanized in U.S. shelters annually has declined from approximately 2.6 million in 2011. If owners had funds to care for their pets’ health needs, these numbers would drastically decrease. This campaign can go a long way in helping people and pets in need. Also, there are many perks available for varying levels of giving.

Impact
The Furry Friends for Senior Citizens and ACARF provides life changing support people and pets in need, offering them a chance to improve their situations. If you want to make a change in the Anderson County community, please consider donating to our campaign. Please spread the word about this campaign to your family and friends by sharing on all media platforms! With donors, supporters, and volunteers like you, we can make a difference!

<h3>Introduction/Biography</h3>
<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>For those who don't know me, my name is Laith (<a href=""https://www.mypronouns.org/they-them"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">they</a>/<a href=""https://www.mypronouns.org/she-her"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">she</a> pronouns and formerly known as Ben/Benji). I'm currently a resident artist with an Atlanta- based dance company and an Emory alumna planning to apply for law school within the next few years. Recently I came out as <a href=""https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/gender-identity/transgender"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">transgender</a> and since then, I've been actively taking steps towards affirming my gender. As a queer person of color from the rural south, the path I've taken to arrive at this understanding of myself has been long, complex, and filled with a lot of fear and anxiety; yet, I feel a huge sense of relief now as I come to know myself on this deeper level. I've been doing <a href=""https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/gender-identity/transgender/what-do-i-need-know-about-transitioning"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hormone Replacement Therapy</a> (HRT) for a little over 4 months now and I can happily say I've seen noticeable differences in my body. This along with other gender affirming care and acts of self expression have brought me a new found sense of gender euphoria, which has translated to a huge improvement in my overall wellbeing. However as I continue HRT, I am coming to terms with some things that cause me <a href=""https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gender-dysphoria/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">dysphoria</a>, which will take more work to alter. For this reason, I have decided that I'll be seeking to go through 3 major gender affirming procedures/processes. The first and foremost being a permanent hair removal process known as <i><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrology"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Electrolysis</a></i>. Being able to permanently remove my hair through this process would vastly improve my mental health and skin in the long run. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p><u>Electrolysis and the Cost</u>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facial and body hair have been a huge source of dysphoria for me since puberty. Unfortunately to combat this, I typically have to shave every day or every other day. Shaving this often often results in razor burn and ingrown hairs which can be both frustrating and painful to deal with on a regular basis. The good news is that there is a hair removal technique know as <strong>electrolysis</strong> that will permanently remove my facial and neck hair after a series of treatments which will occur <strong>every 2 weeks</strong> for a time period period ranging from <strong>12- 16 months</strong>. If you're interested in learning more about the specifics of this process, you can check out the link I provided in the above paragraph.</li>
<li>Unfortunately, electrolysis is a very expensive procedure. After multiple consultations with both laser hair removal and electrolysis specialist, I've received a estimated quote as to how much this procedure will cost me in total; however, how many sessions and how long they take cannot be determined until I'm further along in the process. The typical rate for electrolysis is <strong>$75-$100</strong> <strong>per hour</strong> and during the beginning of my treatment I will have to undergo session lasting somewhere between 4- 6 hours. However, as I continue the the time the treatments take will significantly decrease until each session only last any hour. At this rate, for a year of treatment I'm looking at a projected cost of roughly <strong>$6000- $8000</strong>.</li>
<li>Obviously, this is a huge expense for a working artist to cover on their own. Which is why I'm asking for support. In order to help pay for my transition-related expenses, I've recently applied for a few grants and picked up a 3rd job at a restaurant. While this will be very helpful, I'm still asking for assistance. The plan is to raise <i>at the very least</i> half of this cost within the next 6 weeks, so that I can begin treatments. In the meanwhile, I will be working very hard to match that $4000 with my own funds. Keep in mind that this is <i>only 1</i> of <i>3</i> major and costly procedures that I plan to undergo within the next two years; and so, I will need be continue working these 3 jobs while preparing for law school admissions simultaneously (aka <i>grinding</i>). </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Receiving financial support and assistance for this procedure will undoubtedly remove a huge financial strain from my shoulders, while provide me the opportunity to start saving for future transition-related procedures and law school admissions (also a very expensive process as some of you might know).</li>
<li>Considering all of the physical, mental, and emotional energy that's involved in transitioning I have made the decision to postpone attending law school until I feel that I'm where I want to be in this process. While not putting an exact timeline or rushing any way, I would like to acknowledge that the sooner this happens, the sooner I can move forward pursuing my future career.</li>
<li>Contributing to this fundraiser would effectively support a working black transgender artist. When artist have the support they need to live a healthy and sustainable life, then they can do the thing they do - create their art. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What if You Can't Donate?</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute and I totally get that, but what you still can do is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share this fundraiser with friends, family, coworker, or people who might be looking to support.</li>
<li>Use any of your social platforms to continually boost this fundraiser and help it gain as much traction as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>Thanks in advance</h3>
<p>I just wanted to take a moment here to acknowledge the continued support I have received throughout the years from all of the different communities and spaces I've occupied. Whether it be my folks from back home, my close friends, my colleagues from my undergraduate career, or the dance and artists community- I am extremely grateful. I appreciate each and everyone one of you and your support, regardless of how big or small truly means a lot to me. Thank you all.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>I'm Francesca Murray, founder of B.I.A.B.B.L. ( <i>Brothers In Arms Building Better Lives) </i>FREE program for men at: <a href=""http://brothersinarmsbbl.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://brothersinarmsbbl.com</a>, And I am raising funds for an amazing cause for men to whom I am hoping to offer FREE program that would give them tools to change their lives.</p></li>
<li><p>We provide men with a space to come in and heal without judgment and labels to learn the art of being the best version of themselves. </p></li>
</ul>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get?</h3>
<ul><li><div>
<p>We are seeking to raise: <strong>$23,980.00 for 7 full days.  </strong>Here is what you get:  </p>
<p>The workshops are free so that every man has an opportunity. Funds raised will help cover the costs of running our programs which includes: Venue + equipment rentals, Videographer, printouts/materials, facilitators time, food/refreshments, advertisement. It is currently in its pilot phase because our market research shows that there are no other projects of its kind in Canada, therefore requiring thorough baseline assessments. <strong> </strong></p>
<p>Our costs is for 7 full days, and 11 facilitators, some of whom facilitate for full days, and or multiple days, based on their content. </p>
</div></li></ul>
<ul><li>
<p>Our programs, approach, and mission, gives us the opportunity to work with an audience (men), that has little to no support available in this capacity. Our plans also ensure that kids aren’t father deprived as a result of parents not working together, and can help restore relations that might have suffered. </p>
<p><strong>LETS LOOK AT SOME DATA:</strong></p>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>TRAUMA</strong>: <strong>Here is how it Impacts Men: </strong> ANY amount of trauma experienced during upbringing, includes rape, molestation, physical abuse, psychological abuse combined with conditioning from limiting beliefs can impact one's ability to thrive.  The masculine energy has been conditioned to function substantially differently from the feminine, as a result, not having the appropriate support and resources can drastically impact a man's ability to thrive.</p>
<p>Here are some stats: Source: Statistics Canada</p>
<p>In Canada, in 2011, there were 3728 suicides. 2781 of these suicides were male (Statistics Canada, 2014).</p>
<p>Men aged 40-60 have the highest number of suicides (Statistics Canada, 2014).</p>
<p>Men die by suicide three times more often than women (Statistics Canada, 2014).</p>
<p>In Canada, men die most often by hanging. In the United States, men die most often by firearms.</p>
<p>Men die by suicide more than any other group and these realities must be addressed!</p>
<p>Instead of talking about stress or trying to seek help for their depression, men will often mask their stress and deal with their depression through harmful behaviors and actions. (Ogrodnickzuk, 2011). </p>
<p><strong>Signs of underlying Trauma:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Depression</strong> (often manifest through irritability, suicide, anger, hostility)</p>
<p><strong>Risk-taking behaviors</strong> (violence, addiction)</p>
<p>Avoidance behaviors, Homelessness</p>
<p>90% of male prison inmates grew up in single mother families.</p>
<p>We ALL have underlying TRAUMA. Our program design addresses the underlying gap/root causes.  Its designed to END the era of BLAME CULTURE, and begin a new one that is built on: compassion, understanding, empathy, forgiveness and unity.</p>
<p><strong>SOME RECENT DATA FROM ADDICTION RECOVERY CONFERENCE:</strong></p>
<p><strong>64.4% </strong>OF MEN STRUGGLE WITH ADDICTION</p>
<p>Ages 25-54 years old - <strong>75.6%</strong></p>
<p>Broken down BY ETHNICITY:</p>
<p>Ethnicity (where ""n"" equals there was no ethnicity declared) = 26</p>
<p>Caucasian - <strong>46</strong>%, Indigenous - <strong>31</strong>%, Involuntary - <strong>100</strong>%,</p>
<p>Two or more medical co-morbidities = 46.6%</p>
<p>Schizophrenia spectrum, psychotic, and substance use disorders were only some of the mental health impact captured as a result of addiction: </p>
<p>Nicotine use disorder -<strong>71 </strong>%, Stimulant use disorder - <strong>66.7</strong>% and Opioid use disorder - <strong>51.1 </strong>%</p>
<p>NOTE: There was no measurement to indicate: the number of men whom have turned to Fentanyl use as a measure to ""off-set"" some of the effects/symptoms of other opioid use for example: to stay awake. </p>
<p>The above stats were taken from the Stats Canada report and a recent recovery conference I attended through hospital.</p>
<p><strong>THE REASON FOR SHARING THESE STATS:</strong> So that everyone can see clearly the <strong>IMPACT OF YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR PROGRAM</strong>. And this is just a drop in the bucket when it comes to the magnitude of impact that a program such as ours can create.  What makes our program different from what's out there?  There is NOTHING available in this capacity to serve men.  Our methods combine science and spirituality to form a foundation that would support and address root cases of underlying Trauma. A proactive approach to healing.  </p>
<p>This is how it’s impacting you – 8 out of 10 people suffer from the silent epidemic of mental health crisis, if you are not one of them, I guarantee its someone you know: child, spouse, colleague, neighbor, think about how its impacting their productivity and imprint on life.</p>
<ul><li><p>That's what <i>B.I.A.</i><i><i> </i>FREE program</i> is all about. This is the force behind my creating this company. Our program gives men hope and opportunity by offering them a wide range of tools and resources towards peace and love in their lives.  And, I have the right team to do it; and we have a proven track record of bringing innovative solutions and content to market. Because men, they ARE humans too, and weren't born this way, as the cultural,  gender-stereo-type, nerves of steel (unable to feel emotions).  Our program is the beginning to bridge a system wide gap .</p></li></ul>

<p>To learn more, please go to our website at: <a href=""http://brothersinarmsbbl.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://brothersinarmsbbl.com</a> where you'll find feedback written by the men from our 4 day pilot launched in April 2017. </p>
<p><strong>1 Week ago, this was written by one of the men who attended our launch</strong>: The impact on the men in the program will be a sense of calm and connectivity to life as it is in the moment. A sense of empowerment and ease with their challenges. Each facilitator will show a way to access this ease or state of balance. Through sharing their modality which draws out and openness and facilitate a creativity that inspires the person to see their lives newly, and embrace it from a beginner's mind.</p>
<p>Each facilitator brings in various ways to find balance in the various aspects of modern living like finances, parenting, artistic honoring our own hero inside by choosing within the activities. For example: of choosing which cards relate to the person's unique personality and what they're interested in. Therefore feelings were facilitated and  expressed through what the card represents for them.</p>
<p>You can read additional participant feedback on our website at: <a href=""http://brothersinarmsbbl.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://brothersinarmsbbl.com</a></p>
<p><strong>FACTORS THAT OFFSET SOME OF OUR COSTS:</strong></p>
<ul><li>Facilitators normally charge more for their time which is worth well over what they're currently charging, however; they are donating a generous portion of their time to support the growth of our vision in an effort to give it the traction that it deserves.   ​</li></ul>
<h3><strong>Where will the funds go if we don't reach our entire goal?</strong></h3>
<p>In the event our fundraising goals aren't met, all monies will be deposited to a bank account held by the company until we've reached our goal towards the next program offering.  </p>
<h3><strong>Why is our project valuable to the contributor and to the world?</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p><i>B.I.A.  free </i>program is designed to create a paradigm shift that will shift the way humanity experience each other, and healing. </p>
<p>It is a first of its kind bridging a system wide gap that is limiting in its capacity to serve men. </p>
<p>Our world has always been filled with great men, and you are one of them, and can help  another, whether its your child, colleague, parent, or neighbour, someone you know is suffering, and you can help give them that opportunity to have the knowledge/know how, for peace and love in their lives.</p>
<p>Our men's suicide rate is up 3 to 1. For ever 75 women, 250 men die by suicide per month, that's 3000 men per year in Canada. This number doesn't include those that are still suffering and living alone with depression, anxiety, loneliness, hurt from loosing their loved ones as a result of not know or having the knowledge to change their situation. This is a crises, and you can help change it by contributing to our campaign to help continue this projects beautiful vision. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges if our fundraiser does not meet its goal.</h3>
<p>Risks # 1: Lack of funding could result in limiting to no offering of our program. We offer our program to men for FREE. </p>
<p>Financial - Insufficient funds raised could impact the project. Our venue and equipment needs booking in advance, and all printouts and materials needs to be ready in advance.</p>
<p>This project is also in its pilot phase, being the first or its kind, <strong>thorough</strong> basework assessments will need to be completed, as a result, we also need to cover the cost of our videographer.</p>
<p>Mitigation:  We're Using Indigogo campaigns to help us raise funds. </p>
<p>Risk #2 - Our project is the first of its kind in Canada, having nothing to compare it to automatically increases our risk, we are serving a customer base that is least likely to seek help as result of old conditioning from current system with gaps that have not have met their personal needs and their 'core', judgment, labels, etc.</p>
<p>Mitigation: we have come up with a select 'flow' of materials to help address/bridge these system wide gaps, offering a full spectrum of comprehensive materials to help address those gaps. Each of our facilitators are highly trained in their area of expertise. </p>
<p>Our program is taking a ""heart based"" approach. Recognizing that men are humans too and weren't born this way, we can help break down those barriers to their healing from a place of unconditional compassion.</p>
<p>You can learn more about our facilitators on our website ""About"" section at - <a href=""http://brothersinarmsbbl.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://brothersinarmsbbl.com</a>  </p>
<p>We plan to expand our program offering in the upcoming workshop. We're adding 2 additional programs with additional time.  One of the lessons learnt from our launch:  When men begin to open up for the first time, they require more time and space, and we plan to honor that opening in its full capacity. Therefore, we plan to expand our program from 4 to 7 days.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary

I'm Francesca Murray, founder of B.I.A.B.B.L. ( Brothers In Arms Building Better Lives) FREE program for men at: http://brothersinarmsbbl.com, And I am raising funds for an amazing cause for men to whom I am hoping to offer FREE program that would give them tools to change their lives.
We provide men with a space to come in and heal without judgment and labels to learn the art of being the best version of themselves. 

What We Need & What You Get?

We are seeking to raise: $23,980.00 for 7 full days.  Here is what you get:  
The workshops are free so that every man has an opportunity. Funds raised will help cover the costs of running our programs which includes: Venue + equipment rentals, Videographer, printouts/materials, facilitators time, food/refreshments, advertisement. It is currently in its pilot phase because our market research shows that there are no other projects of its kind in Canada, therefore requiring thorough baseline assessments.  
Our costs is for 7 full days, and 11 facilitators, some of whom facilitate for full days, and or multiple days, based on their content. 


Our programs, approach, and mission, gives us the opportunity to work with an audience (men), that has little to no support available in this capacity. Our plans also ensure that kids aren’t father deprived as a result of parents not working together, and can help restore relations that might have suffered. 
LETS LOOK AT SOME DATA:

TRAUMA: Here is how it Impacts Men:  ANY amount of trauma experienced during upbringing, includes rape, molestation, physical abuse, psychological abuse combined with conditioning from limiting beliefs can impact one's ability to thrive.  The masculine energy has been conditioned to function substantially differently from the feminine, as a result, not having the appropriate support and resources can drastically impact a man's ability to thrive.
Here are some stats: Source: Statistics Canada
In Canada, in 2011, there were 3728 suicides. 2781 of these suicides were male (Statistics Canada, 2014).
Men aged 40-60 have the highest number of suicides (Statistics Canada, 2014).
Men die by suicide three times more often than women (Statistics Canada, 2014).
In Canada, men die most often by hanging. In the United States, men die most often by firearms.
Men die by suicide more than any other group and these realities must be addressed!
Instead of talking about stress or trying to seek help for their depression, men will often mask their stress and deal with their depression through harmful behaviors and actions. (Ogrodnickzuk, 2011). 
Signs of underlying Trauma:
Depression (often manifest through irritability, suicide, anger, hostility)
Risk-taking behaviors (violence, addiction)
Avoidance behaviors, Homelessness
90% of male prison inmates grew up in single mother families.
We ALL have underlying TRAUMA. Our program design addresses the underlying gap/root causes.  Its designed to END the era of BLAME CULTURE, and begin a new one that is built on: compassion, understanding, empathy, forgiveness and unity.
SOME RECENT DATA FROM ADDICTION RECOVERY CONFERENCE:
64.4% OF MEN STRUGGLE WITH ADDICTION
Ages 25-54 years old - 75.6%
Broken down BY ETHNICITY:
Ethnicity (where ""n"" equals there was no ethnicity declared) = 26
Caucasian - 46%, Indigenous - 31%, Involuntary - 100%,
Two or more medical co-morbidities = 46.6%
Schizophrenia spectrum, psychotic, and substance use disorders were only some of the mental health impact captured as a result of addiction: 
Nicotine use disorder -71 %, Stimulant use disorder - 66.7% and Opioid use disorder - 51.1 %
NOTE: There was no measurement to indicate: the number of men whom have turned to Fentanyl use as a measure to ""off-set"" some of the effects/symptoms of other opioid use for example: to stay awake. 
The above stats were taken from the Stats Canada report and a recent recovery conference I attended through hospital.
THE REASON FOR SHARING THESE STATS: So that everyone can see clearly the IMPACT OF YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR PROGRAM. And this is just a drop in the bucket when it comes to the magnitude of impact that a program such as ours can create.  What makes our program different from what's out there?  There is NOTHING available in this capacity to serve men.  Our methods combine science and spirituality to form a foundation that would support and address root cases of underlying Trauma. A proactive approach to healing.  
This is how it’s impacting you – 8 out of 10 people suffer from the silent epidemic of mental health crisis, if you are not one of them, I guarantee its someone you know: child, spouse, colleague, neighbor, think about how its impacting their productivity and imprint on life.
That's what B.I.A. FREE program is all about. This is the force behind my creating this company. Our program gives men hope and opportunity by offering them a wide range of tools and resources towards peace and love in their lives.  And, I have the right team to do it; and we have a proven track record of bringing innovative solutions and content to market. Because men, they ARE humans too, and weren't born this way, as the cultural,  gender-stereo-type, nerves of steel (unable to feel emotions).  Our program is the beginning to bridge a system wide gap .

To learn more, please go to our website at: http://brothersinarmsbbl.com where you'll find feedback written by the men from our 4 day pilot launched in April 2017. 
1 Week ago, this was written by one of the men who attended our launch: The impact on the men in the program will be a sense of calm and connectivity to life as it is in the moment. A sense of empowerment and ease with their challenges. Each facilitator will show a way to access this ease or state of balance. Through sharing their modality which draws out and openness and facilitate a creativity that inspires the person to see their lives newly, and embrace it from a beginner's mind.
Each facilitator brings in various ways to find balance in the various aspects of modern living like finances, parenting, artistic honoring our own hero inside by choosing within the activities. For example: of choosing which cards relate to the person's unique personality and what they're interested in. Therefore feelings were facilitated and  expressed through what the card represents for them.
You can read additional participant feedback on our website at: http://brothersinarmsbbl.com
FACTORS THAT OFFSET SOME OF OUR COSTS:
Facilitators normally charge more for their time which is worth well over what they're currently charging, however; they are donating a generous portion of their time to support the growth of our vision in an effort to give it the traction that it deserves.   ​
Where will the funds go if we don't reach our entire goal?
In the event our fundraising goals aren't met, all monies will be deposited to a bank account held by the company until we've reached our goal towards the next program offering.  
Why is our project valuable to the contributor and to the world?

B.I.A.  free program is designed to create a paradigm shift that will shift the way humanity experience each other, and healing. 
It is a first of its kind bridging a system wide gap that is limiting in its capacity to serve men. 
Our world has always been filled with great men, and you are one of them, and can help  another, whether its your child, colleague, parent, or neighbour, someone you know is suffering, and you can help give them that opportunity to have the knowledge/know how, for peace and love in their lives.
Our men's suicide rate is up 3 to 1. For ever 75 women, 250 men die by suicide per month, that's 3000 men per year in Canada. This number doesn't include those that are still suffering and living alone with depression, anxiety, loneliness, hurt from loosing their loved ones as a result of not know or having the knowledge to change their situation. This is a crises, and you can help change it by contributing to our campaign to help continue this projects beautiful vision. 

Risks & Challenges if our fundraiser does not meet its goal.
Risks # 1: Lack of funding could result in limiting to no offering of our program. We offer our program to men for FREE. 
Financial - Insufficient funds raised could impact the project. Our venue and equipment needs booking in advance, and all printouts and materials needs to be ready in advance.
This project is also in its pilot phase, being the first or its kind, thorough basework assessments will need to be completed, as a result, we also need to cover the cost of our videographer.
Mitigation:  We're Using Indigogo campaigns to help us raise funds. 
Risk #2 - Our project is the first of its kind in Canada, having nothing to compare it to automatically increases our risk, we are serving a customer base that is least likely to seek help as result of old conditioning from current system with gaps that have not have met their personal needs and their 'core', judgment, labels, etc.
Mitigation: we have come up with a select 'flow' of materials to help address/bridge these system wide gaps, offering a full spectrum of comprehensive materials to help address those gaps. Each of our facilitators are highly trained in their area of expertise. 
Our program is taking a ""heart based"" approach. Recognizing that men are humans too and weren't born this way, we can help break down those barriers to their healing from a place of unconditional compassion.
You can learn more about our facilitators on our website ""About"" section at - http://brothersinarmsbbl.com  
We plan to expand our program offering in the upcoming workshop. We're adding 2 additional programs with additional time.  One of the lessons learnt from our launch:  When men begin to open up for the first time, they require more time and space, and we plan to honor that opening in its full capacity. Therefore, we plan to expand our program from 4 to 7 days.

<p><strong>I am April Cheri, a plant witch and community builder. I am seeking support for launching the Crystal Springs Apothecary.</strong></p>
<p>I've been harvesting 25+ medicinal &amp; magical plants from an abandoned community garden on the land where I live. This abundant garden resides alongside Crystal Springs Creek, a protected watershed in the midst of Portland, Oregon. I began spending time in the garden and collecting flowers for my own healing, but soon realized the garden is producing more than enough plant medicine to share with my community through tinctures, teas, skin balms, burn bundles, incenses, candle magic, culinary blends, and more. I've collected and processed an abundance of medicine and I have a few simple needs to make medicinal products available to my community at accessible prices. </p>
<p>The garden and its medicine have returned me to myself. On January 1st of this year I committed to following the song of my soul and this is one of the places it led me. I was an intuitive kitchen witch 20 years ago, providing effective remedies for friends and family. I studied and practiced for a few years before I had to enter the workforce, which somehow repressed that part of my spirit. Now I've been forced out of the workforce by disability (Fibromyalgia and chronic pain) and returning to plant medicine feels like coming home.</p>
<p>I desire to share this goodness and healing with my community. I combine learned knowledge with intuition to create blends that are both medicinal and magical. I strive to work with the plants to support all aspects of our humanity – body, mind, heart, and soul. We are under-nourished in all ways by the dominant culture. Part of my medicine is to support our emotional and spiritual evolution through relationship with our plant friends.</p>
<p>This is a simple one woman project. All aspects of production are done by me with a focus on sharing accessible magic and medicine with my community rather than fancy branding.  </p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>What I Need </strong></p>
<p>Your support will allow me to purchase few pieces of equipment like more jars (!), a scale and strainer; supplies for producing various forms of plant medicine like candle making items, quality liquor (for tinctures), beeswax (for balms), and oils; as well as containers/packaging, labels, and a small printer so that I don't have to repeatedly travel to a copy shop and post office. </p>
<p><strong>What You Will Receive </strong></p>
<p>In return for your generosity you will receive some form of plant medicine from the garden, which may include a burn bundle, magically charged votive candle, incense blend w/charcoal, tea blend, culinary blend, tincture, skin balm, and/or a handmade magical talisman. All products are organic and hand crafted in tiny batches. </p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>This project will impact my community by allowing me to produce large quantities of plant medicine to share.  The medicine this garden is offering is suited to the current cultural climate. Many of the plants are soothing, calming, anti-depressant, and support anxiety and/or trauma.</p>
<p>Personally, this project makes me feel like I am making a contribution again after disability wreaked havoc on my professional identity. Receiving this little boost to purchase supplies will allow me to make medicines for months to come and support the apothecary in becoming a self sustaining project. </p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>I understand that not everyone who would like to support me can make a contribution. If you believe in what I'm doing please consider sharing my campaign on your favorite social networks for greater visibility. </p>
<p>Thank you for your time, your consideration, and your support. </p>

I began spending time in the garden and collecting flowers for my own healing, but soon realized the garden is producing more than enough plant medicine to share with my community through tinctures, teas, skin balms, burn bundles, incenses, candle magic, culinary blends, and more. I've collected and processed an abundance of medicine and I have a few simple needs to make medicinal products available to my community at accessible prices. 
The garden and its medicine have returned me to myself. On January 1st of this year I committed to following the song of my soul and this is one of the places it led me. I was an intuitive kitchen witch 20 years ago, providing effective remedies for friends and family. I studied and practiced for a few years before I had to enter the workforce, which somehow repressed that part of my spirit. Now I've been forced out of the workforce by disability (Fibromyalgia and chronic pain) and returning to plant medicine feels like coming home.
I desire to share this goodness and healing with my community. I combine learned knowledge with intuition to create blends that are both medicinal and magical. I strive to work with the plants to support all aspects of our humanity – body, mind, heart, and soul. We are under-nourished in all ways by the dominant culture. Part of my medicine is to support our emotional and spiritual evolution through relationship with our plant friends.
This is a simple one woman project. All aspects of production are done by me with a focus on sharing accessible magic and medicine with my community rather than fancy branding.  

What I Need 
Your support will allow me to purchase few pieces of equipment like more jars (!), a scale and strainer; supplies for producing various forms of plant medicine like candle making items, quality liquor (for tinctures), beeswax (for balms), and oils; as well as containers/packaging, labels, and a small printer so that I don't have to repeatedly travel to a copy shop and post office. 
What You Will Receive 
In return for your generosity you will receive some form of plant medicine from the garden, which may include a burn bundle, magically charged votive candle, incense blend w/charcoal, tea blend, culinary blend, tincture, skin balm, and/or a handmade magical talisman. All products are organic and hand crafted in tiny batches. 

The Impact
This project will impact my community by allowing me to produce large quantities of plant medicine to share.  The medicine this garden is offering is suited to the current cultural climate. Many of the plants are soothing, calming, anti-depressant, and support anxiety and/or trauma.
Personally, this project makes me feel like I am making a contribution again after disability wreaked havoc on my professional identity. Receiving this little boost to purchase supplies will allow me to make medicines for months to come and support the apothecary in becoming a self sustaining project. 

Other Ways You Can Help
I understand that not everyone who would like to support me can make a contribution. If you believe in what I'm doing please consider sharing my campaign on your favorite social networks for greater visibility. 
Thank you for your time, your consideration, and your support.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p> </p>
<p>This campaign is looking to raise £100k<strong> </strong>of funding. The funding is needed for our growth and expansion plan. As part of our expansion plan, it is our intention to open at least one more clinic during the current year, 2019. </p>
<p>The funding will enable us to be able to secure new premises, complete the refurbishment to match the branding and style of the Reading Clinic, equip the clinic with all the vital tools and equipment to function fully and successfully. </p>

<p><strong>Growth – Expansion Strategy</strong></p>
<p>We have identified two potential sites in a good location with an ideal demographic and population of circa 180k which makes it ideal for the delivery of our services and our vision.</p>
<p>The area we are looking to open our next Clinic, is another Town Centre location that is within 20 miles of Reading thereby ensuring we remain close to our base, the sites are located within a different county and therefore helps us to expand our brand.</p>
<p>One of the potential sites is in  Basingstoke which is the largest town in the county of Hampshire. It is located 30miles from Southampton, 48miles from London and 19miles from Winchester.</p>
<p>Basingstoke is home to Basingstoke Town Football a Semi-Professional club playing in the Southern League Premier Division South. Tom Cleverley, an English International who currently plays for Watford FC, began his football career in Basingstoke, where he was born.</p>
<p>The town is serviced by two large colleges, both provide vocational sports courses and other routes into higher education in sports. The largest college has a well-established connection with other local colleges and universities in nearby cities, particularly on their sports courses.</p>
<p>The well-established education base will provide access to Therapists and be able to offer job and work experience opportunities.</p>

<p>Having a merchandise stand within clinic and an e-store on our website will help to establish the brand and build awareness.</p>
<p>We are so excited to launch our first campaign. However, if we don't reach our full funding target, the funds that have been raised will still be put towards our growth and expansion plan, as well as concentrated marketing for the Reading clinic. </p>

<p><strong>Why Sports Therapy</strong></p>
<p>It is well publicised and known that being active is encouraged by all medical professionals, nutritionists, and employers (especially large corporate’s). This message is spread across all social media and media channels daily.</p>
<p>The impact an active lifestyle has on your health and wellbeing is unarguable. It is widely recognised the benefits being active has, it offers huge health benefits, reducing your risks of some of the largest health risks.</p>
<p>Sustrans state that, ‘there is an approximate 30% reduction in risk for all-cause mortality, across all studies, when comparing the most active with the least active.</p>
<p>From the huge push to encourage the nation to become more active, there has been a noticeable rise in the number of sports clubs/teams forming and expanding.</p>
<p>It is estimated that there are circa 1,400 running clubs across the UK. You will now easily find a running Club in every village, town and city.</p>
<p>In support of the growth of running in general, the rise and popularity of park runs has expanded greatly, with there now being a park run every Saturday morning in over 1,400 locations in twenty-three countries, across five continents.</p>
<p>Cycling UK states that, ‘in 2011, 741,000 working residents aged 16 to74 cycled to work. Another 50,000 or so people use bikes as part of a longer journey.’ Also, ‘The number of people living in London who cycled to work more than doubled from 77,000 in 2001 to 155,000 in 2011.’</p>
<p>This just shows the huge number of people consciously trying to be active, it also shows how the demands to stay active is incorporated into daily lifestyle and isn’t always an extra curriculum activity.</p>
<p>The benefit of an active lifestyle to the individual is unquestionable and the more active and healthier the nation is it also brings an enormous benefit to society as whole. </p>
<p>To compliment the demand for active lifestyles and enable people to continue to be active, the need for musculoskeletal therapists is in high demand.</p>
<p>Sports Therapy is a newly fast developing industry, running alongside Physiotherapy with very similar links and crossovers relating to how each field approaches assessments and treatments. Sports Therapy has become a well-accepted alternative to Physiotherapy. As the public has learnt more and gained more knowledge about Sports Therapy and the holistic hands on approach it has quickly become the favoured treatment option.</p>
<p>Both Physiotherapists and Sports Therapists are highly educated in dealing with musculoskeletal disorders, treating pain and injury through hands-on treatment modalities, rehabilitation and patient education. They both focus on restoring, maintaining and maximising movement, relieving pain and increasing a better quality of life.</p>
<p>The Clinic prides itself on the information shared with our clients, we regularly run free classes workshops on stretching, foam rolling, and other topics that are for the public helping to further increase the awareness of maintaining a healthy lifestyle.</p>
<p><strong>The difference between Sports Therapy and Physiotherapy</strong></p>
<p>Sport Therapist do their training in clinics and sports clubs.</p>
<p>Sports therapists are experts in musculoskeletal disorders. They treat pain and injury through hands on treatment and rehabilitation.</p>
<p>Sports Therapists undergo an intensive three-year degree course which  focusses primarily on the musculoskeletal system and on restoring, maintaining and maximising movement to relieve pain and increase quality of life.</p>
<p>Sports therapists generally have more exposure to sporting environments at an undergraduate level making them ideal for preventing sports injuries through specific strengthening programmes.</p>
<p>Physiotherapy has been around the longest. There are large subsections within the subject of Physiotherapy, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Muscular-Skeletal – problems with your muscles and bone</li>
<li>Neurology – rehabilitation from stuff such as – heart attacks, strokes</li>
<li>Respiratory – help with lung related issues</li>
</ul>
<p>Physiotherapist do their training in hospitals and work with doctors and nurses.  They are mainly medical based.</p>
<p>The role of the Physiotherapists is to help people affected by injury, illness or disability through movement and exercise, manual therapy, education and advice. They maintain health for people of all ages, helping patients to manage pain and prevent disease. </p>
<p>As a new start up company, we appreciate and do not take for granted the hard work and risks involved in this project. There were many obstacles that we had to overcome when setting up and establishing the Reading clinic. These challenges just made us more determined to succeed in delivering our vision and brought  us great knowledge and understanding of how to successfully address and overcome barriers and issues. We have achieved the client base and growth without any formal marketing as we have not had the resources to invest heavily in this area, as all our capital and income has been put into the clinic itself. The fact that we can successfully establish and grow the business without a big marketing budget has shown that the demand for our services and unique approach is there. Imagine what we could do with more resources.....  </p>
</div><div>
<p>I am passionate about the service we provide and how we provide it as well as offering employment opportunities to professionals from the Sport Therapy industry. I truly believe that everyone should have access to healthcare that bring real positive change to their physical and mental well-being and hope that you would like to be part of this movement as well.</p>
<p>Become part of our new movement and donate today to help bring Sports Therapy to high streets across the UK.</p>
</div><p>Any contribution to this campaign is greatly appreciated. </p><p>If you cannot contribute financially, we would appreciate it if you could help us to spread the word about this campaign and Therapists on the High Street. Please use the Indiegogo share tools to help make some noise about the campaign.  </p></div>","Helping to make the nation healthier, happier and improving individuals quality of life!

Why Sports Therapy
It is well publicised and known that being active is encouraged by all medical professionals, nutritionists, and employers (especially large corporate’s). This message is spread across all social media and media channels daily.
The impact an active lifestyle has on your health and wellbeing is unarguable. It is widely recognised the benefits being active has, it offers huge health benefits, reducing your risks of some of the largest health risks.
Sustrans state that, ‘there is an approximate 30% reduction in risk for all-cause mortality, across all studies, when comparing the most active with the least active.
From the huge push to encourage the nation to become more active, there has been a noticeable rise in the number of sports clubs/teams forming and expanding.
It is estimated that there are circa 1,400 running clubs across the UK. You will now easily find a running Club in every village, town and city.
In support of the growth of running in general, the rise and popularity of park runs has expanded greatly, with there now being a park run every Saturday morning in over 1,400 locations in twenty-three countries, across five continents.
Cycling UK states that, ‘in 2011, 741,000 working residents aged 16 to74 cycled to work. Another 50,000 or so people use bikes as part of a longer journey.’ Also, ‘The number of people living in London who cycled to work more than doubled from 77,000 in 2001 to 155,000 in 2011.’
This just shows the huge number of people consciously trying to be active, it also shows how the demands to stay active is incorporated into daily lifestyle and isn’t always an extra curriculum activity.
The benefit of an active lifestyle to the individual is unquestionable and the more active and healthier the nation is it also brings an enormous benefit to society as whole. 
To compliment the demand for active lifestyles and enable people to continue to be active, the need for musculoskeletal therapists is in high demand.
Sports Therapy is a newly fast developing industry, running alongside Physiotherapy with very similar links and crossovers relating to how each field approaches assessments and treatments. Sports Therapy has become a well-accepted alternative to Physiotherapy. As the public has learnt more and gained more knowledge about Sports Therapy and the holistic hands on approach it has quickly become the favoured treatment option.
Both Physiotherapists and Sports Therapists are highly educated in dealing with musculoskeletal disorders, treating pain and injury through hands-on treatment modalities, rehabilitation and patient education. They both focus on restoring, maintaining and maximising movement, relieving pain and increasing a better quality of life.
The Clinic prides itself on the information shared with our clients, we regularly run free classes workshops on stretching, foam rolling, and other topics that are for the public helping to further increase the awareness of maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
The difference between Sports Therapy and Physiotherapy
Sport Therapist do their training in clinics and sports clubs.
Sports therapists are experts in musculoskeletal disorders. They treat pain and injury through hands on treatment and rehabilitation.
Sports Therapists undergo an intensive three-year degree course which  focusses primarily on the musculoskeletal system and on restoring, maintaining and maximising movement to relieve pain and increase quality of life.
Sports therapists generally have more exposure to sporting environments at an undergraduate level making them ideal for preventing sports injuries through specific strengthening programmes.
Physiotherapy has been around the longest. There are large subsections within the subject of Physiotherapy, namely:

Muscular-Skeletal – problems with your muscles and bone
Neurology – rehabilitation from stuff such as – heart attacks, strokes
Respiratory – help with lung related issues

Physiotherapist do their training in hospitals and work with doctors and nurses.  They are mainly medical based.
The role of the Physiotherapists is to help people affected by injury, illness or disability through movement and exercise, manual therapy, education and advice. They maintain health for people of all ages, helping patients to manage pain and prevent disease. 
As a new start up company, we appreciate and do not take for granted the hard work and risks involved in this project. There were many obstacles that we had to overcome when setting up and establishing the Reading clinic. These challenges just made us more determined to succeed in delivering our vision and brought  us great knowledge and understanding of how to successfully address and overcome barriers and issues. We have achieved the client base and growth without any formal marketing as we have not had the resources to invest heavily in this area, as all our capital and income has been put into the clinic itself. The fact that we can successfully establish and grow the business without a big marketing budget has shown that the demand for our services and unique approach is there. Imagine what we could do with more resources.....  

I am passionate about the service we provide and how we provide it as well as offering employment opportunities to professionals from the Sport Therapy industry. I truly believe that everyone should have access to healthcare that bring real positive change to their physical and mental well-being and hope that you would like to be part of this movement as well.
Become part of our new movement and donate today to help bring Sports Therapy to high streets across the UK.

<h2 style=""text-align: right;""><strong>OUR PROJECT</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Arts Republic of Knowlesville project (ARK) </strong>is named after Arthur Koberinski, a close friend, neighbour and generous individual who died unexpectedly Feb 2018.  His newly purchased house (assessed at $37K) was passed to me for a number of reasons in the early part of 2019, by his son Adam and through Arts sister, Jodi Koberinski..  Attempting to following Art's dream of fixing up the house and using at as both residential space to the community and social space, I will walk in his path aiming to fulfill this goal, investing in this vibrant rural community called Knowlesville. Along the way thusfar, a friend has committed 10K cash towards this project!! which brings us to this campaign.</p>
<p><i>For a better standard of living, our culture needs 'some change'. For people to 'change', we need living examples. Founded in permaculture, and thus by design, this unique low-cost member-run resource center &amp; learning space is also a simple stepping stone to individuals/families owning their own land, and learning life skills along the way.

<h2 style=""text-align: right;""><strong>COMMUNITY CONTEXT</strong></h2>
<p>The house is in good shape for an older home and we feel that we can create the ARK within two years of nurturing it and setting clear milestones. Knowlesville, New Brunswick is a vibrant (some may say magical place) and is the best spot possible for this project.  My name is J. Alexander Murray and I have spent the last 9 years practicing permaculture and living off-grid in knowlesville, NB.  Parent of an amazing four-year old, who was birthed in a house I hand built, walking distance down the road, we have come to call this neighborhood home. </p>
<p>I am primary resident and member of a growing, but currently ten family strong community of homesteaders, effectively co-owning &amp; stewarding around 130 acres in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains called the <a href=""http://www.back2land.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>South Knowlesville Neighbourhood Co-op</i></a>. The Co-op provides a lifetime lease of up to a hectare per family/individual. There are two conditions, that you stay in the neighbourhood for a year prior to building and, that this gift of land within the community becomes your primary residence.</p>
<p>The building we are calling the ARK (<i>Arts Republic of Knowlesville</i>) is located walking distance to this growing rural community increases the value, and increases the chance for integration.  For example, most buildings run on solar, while all are off-grid completely and do not have the option of attaching to the grid, where the ARK does; meeting the needs of our member-run access center with facilities like laundry, kitchen and office, tool workshop, etc. The house has a near 2000sq footprint and can meet many needs, and many locals are excited to see it grow into valuable local resource.</p>
<p>With 20 years of experience organizing events, and almost as long living with in some manner of communal living,  we can see a building like the ARK (as a residence on one floor and member run resource center on the main floor), and the manner in which it has come about, becoming an obvious asset to the local rural neighbourhood, as well as the community of off-grid homesteaders. </p>
<p>This might be the first time we’ve done a public funding campaign, but when it comes to following through on campaigns we have many years of experience.  See the annual permaculture inspired art festival - <a href=""http://www.praxisprojectnb.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>the Praxis Project</strong></a>, and involvement in the <a href=""http://www.back2land.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong><u>S</u></strong></a><strong><u><a href=""http://www.back2land.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">outh Knowlesville Neighbourhood Coop</a></u></strong>.  <i>Over the past seven years project manager Alex has designed and completion his off-grid home, greenhouses, multiple out-buildings including geodesic domes, outdoor kitchen and eating spaces and finally colder season tolerant zone 3-5 permaculture orchard design and implementation.</i></p>
<p><strong>We are so close!  This house is already accepted as part of our local NB total home renovation rebate program (aimed at helping become more energy efficient), so we have the go ahead on specific rebates that we are eligible for (<a href=""http://www.praxisprojectnb.com/arkdetails"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">outlined HERE</a>).  </strong></p>

<h2 style=""text-align: right;"">The Impact</h2>
<p>This project could be valuable to you for a few reasons.  One, you personally want this to exist, or in general you like the idea of more permaculture designed examples and learning spaces to exist. Two, you may be very interested in the perks, as we have made them pretty amazing!  You are happily invited and encouraged to visit the ARK as a contributor, picking raspberries, attending a workshop, camping in area, etc. </p>
<p><strong>We want you to support this project because the impacts are far stretching in our location and the example set reaches far beyond our location.  </strong></p>
<p>In an small community word travels fast (<i>Hi neighbours), </i>and in a pond the size of knowlesville, a ripple usually reaches the edges of the water.  ARK will effect, over time indirectly and directly, all residents locally.  Through the straight forward and simple daily and weekly needs like high speed internet access to laundry facilities to the farther reaching effects like how affordable workshops via free teaching space for members effect the neighbourhood; teaching topics like permaculture, home preservation and natural building will create examples and offer a helping hand through the transition to more community trust, abundance and resilience.</p>
<p><i>In this world now, in this time, through our perspective, a commitment to land, and how it is used, is of utmost importance; revolutionary. Make a stand; a dedication to protect &amp; invest in the land base that gives us our future food, water, shelter and medicine.  That land that gave you a place to play and now does so for our children while we find a place to sit in the sun appreciating time.  We want to make this world a better place for those in it, as you probably do too,  This project in partnership with the south knowlesville neighbourhood coop (AKA land trust) are removing a barrier toward access to land, life skill lessons, land based resources identification, relationship building activities and more.  </i></p>

<h2 style=""text-align: right;"">Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>I understand!  You might not be able to help with dollar dollar bills atm, but don't let that scare you away.  if you read this far, i can bet you like the idea and want to see how it unfolds.  You can help us many ways if you so choose to use your time instead of your money ;)  we would value this so very much too!  </p>
<p><strong>You can share our campaign on the world wide web or show it to your family and friends.</strong>  Below is a cut n past ready paragraph (don't forget to add the url link) with a link you can email to a group of people you know would want to hear about this.</p>
<p><i>""Hi.  This Indigogo campaign is something worth looking at!  Permaculture designed resource center and residence, eco-renovation and part of an off grid community in New Brunswick.  I thought of you right away..  Please take a look !  and maybe share:)""</i></p>
<p><strong>You can also join us in the labour driven moments of execution!</strong>  As mentioned there are many labour moments, so we could definitely find value in you joining us.  we can feed you and possibly house you or show you to a camping space if your staying over night.  We are offering many workshop and learning moments during the work, and this is an all ages space, so you can bring your little ones.</p>
<p>As workers, sometimes its hard to find time to cook, or to stop.  Even if you cannot help with the physical labour, <strong>visiting us and bringing us good cheer, possibly food or snacks, or even entertaining our children can be of great value.  </strong>We want you to see the space and to have a hand in its creation! </p>

Arts Republic of Knowlesville project (ARK) is named after Arthur Koberinski, a close friend, neighbour and generous individual who died unexpectedly Feb 2018.  His newly purchased house (assessed at $37K) was passed to me for a number of reasons in the early part of 2019, by his son Adam and through Arts sister, Jodi Koberinski..  Attempting to following Art's dream of fixing up the house and using at as both residential space to the community and social space, I will walk in his path aiming to fulfill this goal, investing in this vibrant rural community called Knowlesville. Along the way thusfar, a friend has committed 10K cash towards this project!! which brings us to this campaign.
For a better standard of living, our culture needs 'some change'. For people to 'change', we need living examples. Founded in permaculture, and thus by design, this unique low-cost member-run resource center & learning space is also a simple stepping stone to individuals/families owning their own land, and learning life skills along the way. Join us in a dynamic multi-purpose living environment architecturally, environmentally and socially at Arts Republic of Knowlesville.

 
COMMUNITY CONTEXT
The house is in good shape for an older home and we feel that we can create the ARK within two years of nurturing it and setting clear milestones. Knowlesville, New Brunswick is a vibrant (some may say magical place) and is the best spot possible for this project.  My name is J. Alexander Murray and I have spent the last 9 years practicing permaculture and living off-grid in knowlesville, NB.  Parent of an amazing four-year old, who was birthed in a house I hand built, walking distance down the road, we have come to call this neighborhood home. 
I am primary resident and member of a growing, but currently ten family strong community of homesteaders, effectively co-owning & stewarding around 130 acres in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains called the South Knowlesville Neighbourhood Co-op. The Co-op provides a lifetime lease of up to a hectare per family/individual. There are two conditions, that you stay in the neighbourhood for a year prior to building and, that this gift of land within the community becomes your primary residence.
The building we are calling the ARK (Arts Republic of Knowlesville) is located walking distance to this growing rural community increases the value, and increases the chance for integration.  For example, most buildings run on solar, while all are off-grid completely and do not have the option of attaching to the grid, where the ARK does; meeting the needs of our member-run access center with facilities like laundry, kitchen and office, tool workshop, etc. The house has a near 2000sq footprint and can meet many needs, and many locals are excited to see it grow into valuable local resource.
With 20 years of experience organizing events, and almost as long living with in some manner of communal living,  we can see a building like the ARK (as a residence on one floor and member run resource center on the main floor), and the manner in which it has come about, becoming an obvious asset to the local rural neighbourhood, as well as the community of off-grid homesteaders. 
This might be the first time we’ve done a public funding campaign, but when it comes to following through on campaigns we have many years of experience.  See the annual permaculture inspired art festival - the Praxis Project, and involvement in the South Knowlesville Neighbourhood Coop.  Over the past seven years project manager Alex has designed and completion his off-grid home, greenhouses, multiple out-buildings including geodesic domes, outdoor kitchen and eating spaces and finally colder season tolerant zone 3-5 permaculture orchard design and implementation.
We are so close!  This house is already accepted as part of our local NB total home renovation rebate program (aimed at helping become more energy efficient), so we have the go ahead on specific rebates that we are eligible for (outlined HERE).

The Impact
This project could be valuable to you for a few reasons.  One, you personally want this to exist, or in general you like the idea of more permaculture designed examples and learning spaces to exist. Two, you may be very interested in the perks, as we have made them pretty amazing!  You are happily invited and encouraged to visit the ARK as a contributor, picking raspberries, attending a workshop, camping in area, etc. 
We want you to support this project because the impacts are far stretching in our location and the example set reaches far beyond our location.  
In an small community word travels fast (Hi neighbours), and in a pond the size of knowlesville, a ripple usually reaches the edges of the water.  ARK will effect, over time indirectly and directly, all residents locally.  Through the straight forward and simple daily and weekly needs like high speed internet access to laundry facilities to the farther reaching effects like how affordable workshops via free teaching space for members effect the neighbourhood; teaching topics like permaculture, home preservation and natural building will create examples and offer a helping hand through the transition to more community trust, abundance and resilience.
In this world now, in this time, through our perspective, a commitment to land, and how it is used, is of utmost importance; revolutionary. Make a stand; a dedication to protect & invest in the land base that gives us our future food, water, shelter and medicine.  That land that gave you a place to play and now does so for our children while we find a place to sit in the sun appreciating time.  We want to make this world a better place for those in it, as you probably do too,  This project in partnership with the south knowlesville neighbourhood coop (AKA land trust) are removing a barrier toward access to land, life skill lessons, land based resources identification, relationship building activities and more.  
 

 

Other Ways You Can Help
I understand!  You might not be able to help with dollar dollar bills atm, but don't let that scare you away.  if you read this far, i can bet you like the idea and want to see how it unfolds.  You can help us many ways if you so choose to use your time instead of your money ;)  we would value this so very much too!  
You can share our campaign on the world wide web or show it to your family and friends.  Below is a cut n past ready paragraph (don't forget to add the url link) with a link you can email to a group of people you know would want to hear about this.
""Hi.  This Indigogo campaign is something worth looking at!  Permaculture designed resource center and residence, eco-renovation and part of an off grid community in New Brunswick.  I thought of you right away..  Please take a look !  and maybe share:)""
You can also join us in the labour driven moments of execution!  As mentioned there are many labour moments, so we could definitely find value in you joining us.  we can feed you and possibly house you or show you to a camping space if your staying over night.  We are offering many workshop and learning moments during the work, and this is an all ages space, so you can bring your little ones.
As workers, sometimes its hard to find time to cook, or to stop.  Even if you cannot help with the physical labour, visiting us and bringing us good cheer, possibly food or snacks, or even entertaining our children can be of great value.  We want you to see the space and to have a hand in its creation! 
Thank you for your time here, and in the future!",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

I spent the next 23 years fulfilling that passion by working my way up as a corporate learning and development professional in large, global high-tech companies, specializing in leadership development.</p>
<p>Around the time I was turning 50, and soon after becoming a volunteer coach for Girls on the Run™ (a national non-profit whose mission is to inspire young girls to be joyful, healthy and confident) something started to feel really missing from my corporate life and I had The Big Epiphany: The optimal time to inspire and develop our future female leaders is before they enter the workforce. This realization awakened, inspired and motivated me to focus my training and coaching primarily on women and young girls so I mustered up the courage, took the leap of faith and started my own leadership development training, coaching and consulting business: <strong>ENSO Life by Design</strong>.</p>

<h3>ABOUT ENSO LIFE BY DESIGN</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1516653016/pyet1kzjobw6wf8nan1r.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>In Zen Buddhism, an ensō is a circle that is hand-drawn in one or two uninhibited brushstrokes to express a moment when the mind is free to let the body create. The circle may be open or closed but when open the circle is incomplete, allowing for movement and development and honoring the beauty of imperfection.</p>
<p>All my training, coaching and consulting is based on the science-based principles and evidence from the fields of neuroscience and positive psychology and more than 20 years of real-world hands-on experience. I have accumulated a vast collection of resources, principles, philosophies and approaches and packaged it all into one singularly focused vision and mission: To help you remember who you truly are and figure out what you were born to do so that you can be truly happy, successful and at peace with your life.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>WHAT IS THE “REDESIGN YOUR LIFE” WORKSHOP / RETREAT FOR WOMEN?</h3>
<p>Sometimes a redesign is a quick and simple tweak and sometimes it requires a wrecking ball. In either case, we never need to settle for anything less than what our heart truly desires because we are the designers of our own lives. The 2018 “Redesign Your Life” workshop / retreat for women takes place one Saturday per month for five consecutive months from 8:30 am– 4:30 pm in 2018 on: February 10, March 3, April 7, May 5 and June 2. It encompasses information, knowledge, experience, activities and tools from a wide variety of sources including breakthrough discoveries from the fields of neuroscience and positive psychology and consolidates and compresses it all into one rich, experiential, productive, inspirational and fun learning, growth and development process. The result? Acquire key insights about where you are today and why, where you want to be and how to get there and then dig deep to muster up the courage and confidence that is already within you to let yourself fly.</p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>Part Workshop, Part Retreat?</strong></p>
<p>If we want different / better results, we must do the work…there simply is no escaping that fact. However, all work and no play is not sustainable…we need to take a break, get away, slow down, get quiet and tune in to prepare ourselves for the journey of self development and growth. The holistic design of the workshop / retreat structure includes and integrates informative / educational, experiential and reflective learning modalities.</p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>How Does It Work?</strong></p>
<p>Personal growth and development is a process…a journey…not an event. Spending a day, a weekend or even a week participating in a learning program rarely yields the desired or expected return on investment of time and money. The intentional time and space between each monthly session allows the seeds of learning and inspiration to germinate and take root. You will be assigned simple, manageable tasks to complete on your own which will increase your retention and accelerate your progress and results. You also have the option of unlimited phone coaching / consultation between each monthly session. </p>
<p><strong>What Are The Expected Results?</strong><br/>While the specific outcomes and changes each individual woman desires and achieves will vary, all participants will gain: 1) key insights about where they are today and why; 2) actionable clarity about where their heart truly wants them to be and; 3) the support you need and deserve to help you unleash the courage that is already inside you to redesign your life.</p>
<p><strong>What Topics are Covered?</strong><br/>•    Self Compassion / Self Care / Resiliency<br/>•    Slowing Down / Getting Quiet / Being Still<br/>•    Mind-Body Connection / Physical Movement / Energy<br/>•    Connecting with Nature and Beauty<br/>•    Clearing the Clutter / Letting Go of Obstacles<br/>•    Creativity / Self Expression / The Power of Play<br/>•    Abundance Mindset / Gratitude / Generosity<br/>•    Action Planning / Sustaining and Maintaining</p>

<h3>WHAT I AM ASKING FOR AND WHY?</h3>
<p>Given the incredibly inspirational venue and highly experienced and talented faculty, the cost for participating in this 5-month program ranges from $1,500 0 $2,250 per person depending on how early or late you register. While there are several women already registered, I have found the cost to be prohibitive for many women who do not come from the corporate world. My goal and mission is to make this life-changing experience accessible for many more women and to that end, I have personally donated six scholarships for women who need and want this but cannot afford to pay. I am asking for that to be matched with an additional six scholarships to be funded by those of you out there who see the value and want to help more women benefit from this experience.</p>
<h3>THE IMPACT YOUR SUPPORT COULD HAVE</h3>
<p>Change the world by making it a happier, more peaceful place. No, I’m not joking. I am totally serious. Peace in the world starts with peace in oneself and peace in one’s self comes from finding and living your purpose and reconnecting with your joy. As Mahatma Gandhi said, “Be the change that you wish to see in the world.” I truly believe that unless or until we are at peace and happy within ourselves, there is very little hope of bringing peace and happiness into the world. </p>

I have accumulated a vast collection of resources, principles, philosophies and approaches and packaged it all into one singularly focused vision and mission: To help you remember who you truly are and figure out what you were born to do so that you can be truly happy, successful and at peace with your life.  

WHAT IS THE “REDESIGN YOUR LIFE” WORKSHOP / RETREAT FOR WOMEN?
Sometimes a redesign is a quick and simple tweak and sometimes it requires a wrecking ball. In either case, we never need to settle for anything less than what our heart truly desires because we are the designers of our own lives. The 2018 “Redesign Your Life” workshop / retreat for women takes place one Saturday per month for five consecutive months from 8:30 am– 4:30 pm in 2018 on: February 10, March 3, April 7, May 5 and June 2. It encompasses information, knowledge, experience, activities and tools from a wide variety of sources including breakthrough discoveries from the fields of neuroscience and positive psychology and consolidates and compresses it all into one rich, experiential, productive, inspirational and fun learning, growth and development process. The result? Acquire key insights about where you are today and why, where you want to be and how to get there and then dig deep to muster up the courage and confidence that is already within you to let yourself fly.

Part Workshop, Part Retreat?
If we want different / better results, we must do the work…there simply is no escaping that fact. However, all work and no play is not sustainable…we need to take a break, get away, slow down, get quiet and tune in to prepare ourselves for the journey of self development and growth. The holistic design of the workshop / retreat structure includes and integrates informative / educational, experiential and reflective learning modalities.

How Does It Work?
Personal growth and development is a process…a journey…not an event. Spending a day, a weekend or even a week participating in a learning program rarely yields the desired or expected return on investment of time and money. The intentional time and space between each monthly session allows the seeds of learning and inspiration to germinate and take root. You will be assigned simple, manageable tasks to complete on your own which will increase your retention and accelerate your progress and results. You also have the option of unlimited phone coaching / consultation between each monthly session. 
What Are The Expected Results?While the specific outcomes and changes each individual woman desires and achieves will vary, all participants will gain: 1) key insights about where they are today and why; 2) actionable clarity about where their heart truly wants them to be and; 3) the support you need and deserve to help you unleash the courage that is already inside you to redesign your life.
What Topics are Covered?•    Self Compassion / Self Care / Resiliency•    Slowing Down / Getting Quiet / Being Still•    Mind-Body Connection / Physical Movement / Energy•    Connecting with Nature and Beauty•    Clearing the Clutter / Letting Go of Obstacles•    Creativity / Self Expression / The Power of Play•    Abundance Mindset / Gratitude / Generosity•    Action Planning / Sustaining and Maintaining
Where Does the Workshop / Retreat Take Place?The monthly sessions are held at Alnoba: “Where Inspiration Meets Action.” Wonderfully secluded in the woods of Kensington, NH yet easily accessible by car, Alnoba is just one hour from Boston, Concord, NH and Portland, ME, 20 minutes from Portsmouth, NH and just minutes off Routes 95 and 495.
What Is Included in the Workshop / Retreat?•    Five full days (one Saturday a month for five consecutive months) of professionally designed and facilitated educational workshops and inspirational personal retreat experiences.•    Access to 400 protected acres of fields, woodlands, ponds, walking trails and scenic spots to linger and reflect.•    Access to a variety of inviting indoor spaces within an expansive newly constructed state-of-the-art sustainable meeting facility.•    Healthy farm-to-table breakfast, lunch and snacks each day.•    Unlimited coaching / consultation between monthly sessions.•    All learning materials and supplies.(Travel and / or accommodation expenses are not included.)
Who Are the Session Leaders?I am the Lead Facilitator and am joined by four amazing Supporting Faculty who are inspiring experts in the fields of yoga / meditation, fitness, creativity and vocal expression.
Debra Schuler – has more than 20 years of experience in corporate learning and development with an emphasis on personal effectiveness and leadership. Since redesigning her own life and launching “ENSO Life by Design” in February 2016, she has narrowed and deepened her focus on helping people lead themselves and their lives with more clarity, purpose and intention to achieve greater fulfillment, joy, success and happiness. www.ensolifebydesign.com
Hannelore Moebius - (C-IAYT, E-RYT 500, APP) is a Yoga Therapist and Ayurvedic Practitioner originally from Germany. She was the founder and director of The Prana Studio for Yoga & Health in Durham, NH for 20 years and continues to share her compassionate and meditative approach in Yoga classes, workshops, Polarity and Reiki sessions, and has offered several Therapeutic Yoga Teacher Training Programs. www.moebius-yoga.com
Alexandra Poulis - started dancing at the age of four and after discovering her love for fitness soon after graduating from the University of NH became an AFAA Certified Group Fitness Instructor and Personal Trainer. She owns her own fitness studio, “Fierce Fit,” a welcoming and fun environment for movement and giving back to the community. www.FierceFitNH.com
Lesley Arnold – is an entrepreneur who is passionate about creative expression and community outreach. She owned / operated a second-hand store supporting local NH charities and has her own painting studio called “Wet Paint.” She loves encouraging people to discover and reconnect with their innate creativity through art and the joy and healing that comes from her work. www.wetpaintnh.com
 
Claude Stein – is a Multi-Platinum award winning voice coach and pioneer in the use of expressive performance techniques to build confidence. His approach and coaching help people align their inner and outer voices to create authentic and empowering messages, deeper emotional connection and transformational personal change and growth. www.claudestein.com
 
WHAT I AM ASKING FOR AND WHY?
Given the incredibly inspirational venue and highly experienced and talented faculty, the cost for participating in this 5-month program ranges from $1,500 0 $2,250 per person depending on how early or late you register. While there are several women already registered, I have found the cost to be prohibitive for many women who do not come from the corporate world. My goal and mission is to make this life-changing experience accessible for many more women and to that end, I have personally donated six scholarships for women who need and want this but cannot afford to pay. I am asking for that to be matched with an additional six scholarships to be funded by those of you out there who see the value and want to help more women benefit from this experience.
THE IMPACT YOUR SUPPORT COULD HAVE
Change the world by making it a happier, more peaceful place. No, I’m not joking. I am totally serious. Peace in the world starts with peace in oneself and peace in one’s self comes from finding and living your purpose and reconnecting with your joy. As Mahatma Gandhi said, “Be the change that you wish to see in the world.” I truly believe that unless or until we are at peace and happy within ourselves, there is very little hope of bringing peace and happiness into the world.",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Rehab Revolution</h3>
<p>The old ways of dealing with addiction and mental afflictions must go - we need a new, holistic approach that takes mind, body AND spirit into consideration. On October 1st, we are launching our first rehab programme/meditation study, which we hope will set a new and improved standard for all future dealings with addiction. Here's where we go wrong today:</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/ao8L-0nSYzg?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>Sobriety is not our end goal, it's simply a byproduct of the deepened sense of happiness, contentment and self-love that is the foundation of Kundalini Yoga and, hence, our programme. </p>
<p>We have worked night and day for the down payment (€ 10 000) of the venue, which is located in the lush and beautiful backcountry of South Africa, a few hours outside of Cape Town, so we have already gathered 1/10th ourselves, but we need your donations to pay for the costly brain scans and operational expenses.</p>
<p>We believe that the Kundalini practice for addiction, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwtAS71v0o0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""meditation for habituation""</a>, targets and tweaks the insular cortex, which has <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/06/health/psychology/06brain.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">proven</a> to be an integral part of the brain when it comes to addictive behaviour. Besides this neurological aspect, the healing technology of Kundalini Yoga also allows us to deal with our traumas on a psychological, biological, mental and spiritual level. </p>
<p>There's a successful addiction treatment called ""Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation"", which targets the insula, and it works through the temple lobe, just like our meditation, but it is only available at a few hospitals. We believe that this meditation is even more efficient, as it also forces us to deal with our core issues, rather than being a ""quick fix"".</p>
<p>By donating to our cause, not only will you help our first group of 12 people to heal themselves, but everyone facing the same challenges in the future, knowing they can heal themselves for free, at home, doing this meditation.</p>
<p>According to yogic philosophy, we are all the co-creators of our universe, and our participants will be treated as such. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<ul>
<li>At least € 108 000 by October 1st, or € 9000 per participant, which breaks down to the following:</li>
<li>€ 6000 per participant for MRI scans before and after completing the programme</li>
<li>€ 22 000 for the venue</li>
<li>€ 14 000 for operational expenses (food and transportation, medical staff etc)</li>
</ul>
<h3>What We'll Provide</h3>
<ul>
<li>Great locally produced vegetarian &amp; vegan food: learn how to nurture yourself through food.</li>
<li>Kundalini Yoga Teachers with personal experience of overcoming addiction.</li>
<li>A deep, profound and applicable teacher's level understanding of Yoga</li>
<li>A 9-day excursion into the wilderness: learn basic survival skills and build self-esteem.</li>
<li>Guest teachers from different traditions.</li>
<li>Teacher Plants: we cooperate with an ibogaine center, for those participants willing.</li>
<li>A highly experienced ground team with medical and spiritual training.</li>
<li>The proper, sustainable tools to live according to your highest purpose and potential.</li>
<li>Promoting instead of demoting habits</li>
<li>A network of caring people</li>
</ul>
<p>If we end up with less than € 108 000, we will proceed with the programme anyway, and simply adjust it accordingly. We will be 100% transparent and account for every cent that is put in to this project. </p>

<h3>Short FAQ:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Is the programme free for the participants?</strong><br/>No. ""If you come empty-handed, you leave empty-handed"". The minimum requirement is that every participant pay for the flight, and, if possible, make a donation to the campaign according to their individual, financial situation.</li>
<li>
<strong>Can I apply?</strong><br/>Yes. Please send an email to reconfigure@behandlingsyoga.se </li>

<strong>I have never tried yoga. Can I still apply?</strong><br/>Yes. We will begin at a beginner's level and adjust everything after everyone's individual ability.</li>

And here's a more specific, rehab-oriented <a href=""https://www.3ho.org/3ho-lifestyle/health-and-healing/kundalini-yoga-and-use-recreational-drugs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">explanation</a>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Is Ibogaine a cure for addiction?</strong><br/>No. A ""cure"" suggests an outside solution, but we need to find it within ourselves, so there is no ""cure"" in that sense, only lessons to be learned, but ibogaine is pretty much as close as you get, since you condense a lifetime of lessons into a 24 hour session.</li>
<li>
<strong>I would like to participate in the programme but can't be away for 60 days. What do I do?</strong><br/>Do your best at home! See if you can find a yoga studio close to where you live. If you can't find one, there are thousands of kundalini yoga tutorials and videos online. Nothing beats the own experience - try a ""kriya"" or a meditation and see what it does for you.</li>
<li>
<strong>What do I get for contributing?</strong><br/>You get the chance to help and be part of something greater than your ego. However, ego might work in our favour sometimes. If you'd like to make a game-changing donation, we'd be willing to name our programme and/or the supposed meditation effect after you.</li>
<li>
<strong>How can I help if I can't donate?</strong><br/>Please share our video to everyone you know. Our project is pretty much dependant on the public interest in it, we need all the help we can get.</li>
<li>
<strong>How are you supposed to raise € 108 000 in less than two months?</strong><br/>With your help. Please donate :)</li>
<li>
<strong>Where can I read more?</strong><br/>The computer containing the english version of our <a href=""http://behandlingsyoga.se/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">website</a> just crashed, but it's still full of useful links.

For example, most of us believe that high-quality towels should be heavy and plush like conventional cotton towels. However, said characteristics make them bulky and heavy, drying time is long and they are susceptible to odor and bacteria growth. Many of us tend to choose polyester for our fitness routines in order to carry less weight and save space in our sport bag. Both options do not leave us satisfied and they are far from being sustainable. As for throws, the most popular choices are a) polyester which is not pleasant to be around nor is it natural as it made of petroleum, a sub-product of oil or b) natural wool but it can be itchy, heavy, and difficult to take care of. <strong>So we asked ourselves what if there is a better option?</strong></p><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1574160206/ebb3bb86gsx87qjkbcir.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Our Materials</strong></h2><p>After 8 months of research and development, Aprioria Textiles created a line of products made of 100% linen.

It makes them ideal companions for fitness and personal care.</p><p>Second, our towels and throws <strong>dry more rapidly</strong> then cotton items which makes them more practical.  They are made of the <strong>flax plant</strong>, which has a hollow structure that allows for high air permeability. So no more damp and musty towels in the bathroom!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1574160274/jjqwo7b7hz38rikbouk1.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Third, every Aprioria Textiles linen towel possesses <strong>exceptional qualities</strong> which make them ideal for the most sensitive skin. They are <strong>hypoallergenic</strong><strong>, antistatic as well as hygienic and antibacterial</strong>. Conventional cotton or polyester have none of these characteristics and often provoke skin irritation. Also, our throw is a perfect <strong>natural insulator</strong> due to the temperature regulating properties of linen.  They keep your body cool in the summer, warm in the winter and relaxed year round.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1574160896/fdbxmcsvlv4ub2xlwzwo.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Fourth, we have created <strong>durable</strong> and long lasting products. They are 30% stronger than cotton so you do not need to replace them nearly as often. It <strong>saves money.</strong></p><p>And last but not least, our products are <strong>environmentally friendly</strong>. Linen is a natural fiber made from the flax plant which reaches maturity in 100 days. It does not require any pesticides or any additional irrigation other than rain water. Linen is <strong>biodegradable</strong> and easily <strong>recyclable without carbon generating processes</strong>. Linen products, if left out in normal outdoor environmental conditions, will <strong>self-compost</strong> in less than a year.  </p><p>On the top of all the advantages, Aprioria Textiles linen towels provide you with a <strong>light exfoliating effect</strong> due to its particular weaving.

Our creator Anna heard many times from people in the classes she attended how unpleasant and irritating using polyester towels are. Such unnatural towels can significantly hinder the pleasantness from the practice. Keeping this in mind, we wanted to create something different – textiles that are practical, versatile, pleasant to touch, naturally breathable and eco-friendly.

For example, most of us believe that high-quality towels should be heavy and plush like conventional cotton towels. However, said characteristics make them bulky and heavy, drying time is long and they are susceptible to odor and bacteria growth. Many of us tend to choose polyester for our fitness routines in order to carry less weight and save space in our sport bag. Both options do not leave us satisfied and they are far from being sustainable. As for throws, the most popular choices are a) polyester which is not pleasant to be around nor is it natural as it made of petroleum, a sub-product of oil or b) natural wool but it can be itchy, heavy, and difficult to take care of. So we asked ourselves what if there is a better option?Our MaterialsAfter 8 months of research and development, Aprioria Textiles created a line of products made of 100% linen. We choose linen for its abundant extraordinary qualities.Why to Choose Aprioria Textiles?First, Aprioria Textiles items are much lighter than cotton items of the same size.  They take less space while being 30 % more absorbent. It makes them ideal companions for fitness and personal care.Second, our towels and throws dry more rapidly then cotton items which makes them more practical.  They are made of the flax plant, which has a hollow structure that allows for high air permeability. So no more damp and musty towels in the bathroom!Third, every Aprioria Textiles linen towel possesses exceptional qualities which make them ideal for the most sensitive skin. They are hypoallergenic, antistatic as well as hygienic and antibacterial. Conventional cotton or polyester have none of these characteristics and often provoke skin irritation. Also, our throw is a perfect natural insulator due to the temperature regulating properties of linen.  They keep your body cool in the summer, warm in the winter and relaxed year round.Fourth, we have created durable and long lasting products. They are 30% stronger than cotton so you do not need to replace them nearly as often. It saves money.And last but not least, our products are environmentally friendly. Linen is a natural fiber made from the flax plant which reaches maturity in 100 days. It does not require any pesticides or any additional irrigation other than rain water. Linen is biodegradable and easily recyclable without carbon generating processes. Linen products, if left out in normal outdoor environmental conditions, will self-compost in less than a year.  On the top of all the advantages, Aprioria Textiles linen towels provide you with a light exfoliating effect due to its particular weaving. So taking care of your body and the environment in our fast paced world can be easy.Mindful Design for Feeling GoodWe believe that life is all about the little things.  While living in our fast moving and stressful world, surrounding ourselves with sensually pleasant products is important to reduce stress. Most of all we want you to feel good about yourself while using our towels and throws. Comfort is one of our cornerstones, so we design pieces which flatter your body.How We Came Up With The Idea?Since 2018, we have been thinking about ways to replace polyester towels which are widely used in yoga, palates classes and in the gym. Our creator Anna heard many times from people in the classes she attended how unpleasant and irritating using polyester towels are. Such unnatural towels can significantly hinder the pleasantness from the practice. Keeping this in mind, we wanted to create something different – textiles that are practical, versatile, pleasant to touch, naturally breathable and eco-friendly. While discovering the extraordinary qualities of linen, we decided to expand our line to include towels for fitness, bath, face and hands as well as linen throws and beach sheets.From Picnic to Meditation and Everything in BetweenMultifunctional products for adults and children are very important to us. Each of our products are crafted with longevity and versatility in mind. Designed to take you effortlessly from day to night, from bathroom to gym, from your home to a picnic in the park or mediation practice.Our Products: Design Attributes and SizesOur towels have a special honeycomb weaving for better absorbency and for providing a light exfoliating effect.Our throws are made of unique double layered linen fabric which gives them a cashmere like touch and make them extra comfortable to cuddle with.Especially for the Indiegogo campaign, we created a limited addition beach sheet. They are our summertime ""must-haves"". Light, durable and  easy to take care of. Our ProductionAll our products are ethically made in Europe. After a long search for a production facility, we chose one situated in the European part of Russia which has been an industry leading specialist in linen production for more than 150 years. For a long time, it has been the linen supplier of Russian royalty and continues to be a world renowned linen producer. We are happy to support production that takes care of long-lasting textile traditions as well as provide thousands of working places for local people. Most of the employees are professionals with experience of 20-35 years.  They work 8 hour shifts with a lunch and tea breaks, have paid vacation and medical care as well as support of labor unions. As you can imagine, people are happy to work in a stable environment producing items which are highly appreciated around the world. We love visiting our production partner in order to foster a close working relationship with the individuals who are producing exceptional products for you. International Certifications of our Production Partner Include:
OEKO-TEX® Certification - you can be certain that every component of our products have been tested for harmful substances and that the products therefore is harmless in human ecological terms. 
BSCI Certification - every product is produced in a factory that strictly adheres to BSCI requirements that implements the principle international labor standards protecting workers’ rights. PackagingWe package our items in biodegradable bags and recyclable envelopes. No Scraps, No WasteWe have designed our products in a way that there is no production waste or leftover fabric.  Everything weaved is being fully utilized.Our Team We are a family run business operated by Anna and Lance. We invested our time, energy and savings in order to create an alternative to conventional textiles as well as inspire people to live more consciously and sustainably.Anna is a co-founder and the creator of Aprioria Textiles. She is a graduate of Central Saint Martin’s College of Art and Design in London and has been working with textiles since childhood. She formulated an idea and spent several months developing and testing prototypes before she would receive the right result. She is a creative professional with boundless enthusiasm for her work.Lance is a co-founder and the managing force behind Aprioria Textiles. Lance holds an MBA from IE Business School in Madrid, as well as an undergraduate degree in finance and management from Grand Valley State University. He has spent his career working for a number of international companies which has given him the ability to look at common things from a different perspective.Color of the product is subject to change.Why Do We Need Your Pledge?Creating sustainable textiles in a world of mass market, fast consumption and instant gratification takes a lot of courage that our team definitely possesses. In order to scale our efforts we need your support. We believe in the synergy of our boundless energy, enthusiasm, hard work, and support of people, who like us, believe that big changes can be achieved with little things, like towels and throws.Our conservative campaign goal is 15,000 euros. This target covers the initial order with the producer, fulfillment to our Indiegogo backers, and allows us to deploy a small quantity of products on the European market for proof of concept. However, our ideal goal is 45,000 euros.  This goal will allow us to accelerate scaling. The cost of research, prototype creation and testing, roadshow to visit production candidates, administrative, legal and marketing expenses prior this campaign has been fully funded by us.Our Fair PricesWe believe that fairly produced linen textiles cannot cost the same as mass market conventional products. Growing, harvesting, treating flax, weaving the fabric, sewing textile items and finishing by hand is a time-consuming process which requires many highly skilled professionals. Just imagine that to produce the fringe on our throws takes a skilled seamstress several hours to complete.We believe that all work during this process should be fairly compensated. We would like to inspire our clients to respect their items, take good care of them, and to create a connection with the products. It may sound strange for a textiles brand but we want you to buy less and buy better.Choose Consciously When You ShopA throw at a leading mass market retailer can cost 30 euros or more but it is made of polyester and will loose its initial look and feel in a couple of months, if not in weeks and create additional waste. We do not offer just another towel; we offer towels which will last.

While Peter was in Dublin working, his father Owen (a retired veterinarian and widower) was on hand to meet and greet the guests. This was a positive and enjoyable experience for him, meeting new people from different places. However when some older guests came to stay, the level of social interaction went to a whole other level. He would take them to the local pub or sightseeing, they might have dinner together or a game of golf. In essence, fun was being had and friendships were being formed that went way beyond the usual host/guest interaction. Indeed the reviews from these ‘senior’ guests were exceptional, saying this social aspect was a highlight of their trip. Seeing the enriching social benefits that his father was now enjoying prompted Peter to think how he could encapsulate and replicate this life-enhancing experience for the benefit of older adults everywhere. Fast forward 2 and a half years, and The Freebird Club is up and running as a global membership club for older adults, offering meaningful social engagement through travel and hosting opportunities. We now need funds to build a team and organisation that can truly deliver on our vision of an age-friendly and inclusive world. Your support will help us make the difference and improve the lives of older adults around the world.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509971887/fkpbitxgtecqfbbaceyk.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong><i>Founder Peter Mangan with his father Owen at home in County Kerry, Ireland.</i></strong></p><p> </p><h3><strong>WHO WE ARE </strong></h3><p>The Freebird Club is a travel-based social club for older adults, enabling positive 'connected ageing’ through social travel and homestays between members. Our mission is to connect and enrich the lives of older adults, fostering an age-friendly and inclusive world. Operating as a global peer-to-peer members club, we enable older adults to travel and stay with each other as part of a trusted community of socially minded peers. In doing so we offer a whole new way of travelling for older adults, a means to unlock asset value in their homes and earn extra income, and a fun accessible way to meet new people and enjoy social and cultural interaction in later life.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509977201/tdkr8qurmfchr6q59h44.jpg"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509977221/sgemh0wehuifdxbbcfue.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3> </h3><h3><strong>PROBLEMS WE ARE TACKLING                                                    </strong></h3><ol>
<li>Loneliness and isolation - one of the biggest issues facing older adults today, carrying significant health risks such as coronary heart disease, stroke and dementia.</li>
<li>Financial insecurity in later life - many seniors struggle with inadequate pensions</li>
<li>Lack of travel options for older people - research indicates many seniors would like to travel more but either lack companionship or the confidence to do it alone.</li>
</ol><p>The ageing of society is a global phenomenon due to increased human longevity and falling birth rates. Globally the number and % of older persons (60+) is growing dramatically - from 900m in 2015 to over 2 billion by 2050. Globally 40% of older persons live independently (alone or with spouse only); in more developed countries the figure is c.75% (UN Dept of Economic &amp; Social Affairs Population Report). In the UK, recent studies indicate that almost 1 in 6 adults over age 65 are chronically lonely. Healthwise, chronic loneliness has been correlated to smoking over 15 cigarettes a day and presents a higher health risk than obesity.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>OUR SOLUTION </strong></h3><p>The Freebird Club provides a customised ‘age-friendly’ platform to enable older adults engage in peer-to-peer homestays and vacations with each other through an online membership club. Using the host/guest model, 'hosts' can make their spare rooms available to fellow members to come and stay for a nightly rate. Visits always involve staying with the live-in host present, as the emphasis is as much on the company as the accommodation. By creatively combining a travel site and a companionship site (where members have personal profiles describing themselves and their interests), we facilitate people finding people, not just a place to stay.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509985801/rq2lqjvb6bkknwpzzqse.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3><a name=""_Hlk494881177"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>INTERNATIONAL AWARDS </strong></a></h3><ul>

In our rapidly ageing society, there are more and more older adults dealing with loneliness and isolation. There are also increasing numbers of people struggling on inadequate pensions. These are not just unfortunate situations on an individual or human level, they also carry significant costs for society, tax payers and the economy. We want to do something about that. We want to contribute to a world where people no longer find themselves lonely or isolated or disconnected by virtue of their age. We want to enable financial independence and economic sustainability for older adults. We want to create a real movement - empowering and inspiring older adults to enjoy the world around them regardless of age. We are using the ‘sharing economy’ to achieve this. However our vision goes beyond the sharing economy, we want to champion a new ‘caring economy’, where people are what matter most, and the social impact is as important as the economic return.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509985547/xfnezmibtcpvsnube1f9.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3><strong>OUR TEAM</strong></h3><p>Our Dublin-based team has now expanded to seven people, with staff working across marketing, web development and customer service. We also have a group of senior volunteers providing their time and skills to advance the project, as well as an international Strategic Advisory Board providing expert advice and guidance on all things ageing, innovation and enterprise development. In line with our positive ageing ethos, we have established a “50 Over 50” employment plan, whereby at least 50% of Freebird Club staff will be aged over 50. Not only is this an overt anti-ageism strategy, it also provides the company with unique insights and a ‘window’ into the particular challenges of our user demographic, as well as a more empathetic customer support ethos.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>OUR PROGRESS &amp; PLANS</strong></h3><p>Following a successful pilot phase in 2016, we formally launched the Freebird Club in April 2017. Already we have over 1500 Freebird members in 38 countries worldwide, and membership is growing daily. While the original concept is based around individual members, we now want to build an ‘Organisational Portal’ to allow age organisations to join as affiliate members (eg. positive ageing organisations, charities, retirement clubs, societies, care homes, etc). Extending the Freebird Club to allow age organisations as members would enable us to have a much wider reach and impact. Through their association with such age organisations, we could engage the ‘harder to reach’ older adults who could benefit most from social interaction – i.e. those who might otherwise be excluded, due to extreme isolation, lack of tech skills, or health/mobility. Working with age organisations would also allow us to facilitate coordinated group trips for their clients/members, enabling them to stay collectively with friendly approved hosts in a particular community. This would result in a far more inclusive model, with potentially far greater social impact.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>WHAT WE NEED</strong></h3><p>We have big plans and even bigger dreams to develop the Freebird Club to achieve the kind of impact that can really make a difference in people’s lives. We need to build a team and organisational infrastructure to do that. While we have been relatively successful in fundraising through grants and awards, we now need additional resources to get to the next stage - to fund our growth, and in particular the development of our new ‘Organisational Portal’. The funds will be used as follows:</p><ol>
<li>Technology Development: We need to build a professional in-house technology and web development team. The Freebird Club has significant plans for product development, which require upgrading the infrastructure of the website and adding considerable new features. The Organisational Portal is a key part of this.</li>
<li value=""2"">Marketing: Freebird is a global concept, and this is reflected both in the international press coverage and our awards/accolades to date. There are significant market opportunities that are ready to be capitalized on. Increase in marketing staff is essential if we are to scale up the business such that so we can target and service global markets.</li>
<li value=""3"">Customer Service: The Freebird Club has stipulated its intention to provide ‘best-in-class’ customer service tailored to its older adult customer demographic. A core trained support team is needed to deliver on this.</li>
</ol><h3> </h3><h3><strong>HOW YOU CAN HELP </strong></h3><p>We have come this far on belief, hard work and limited resources. We now need help to write the next chapter. By contributing to our campaign, you can help us change the narrative on ageing, help people enjoy their ‘golden years’ and reduce the risk of loneliness in old age.</p><p>If you are unable to contribute personally, please help us by sharing our campaign with your friends, family and community. Each share will be a building block for an age-inclusive world, and a better future for older adults everywhere.</p><p> </p><h3>INTERNATIONAL PRESS COVERAGE</h3><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509991945/osnvzg8vd9wjndzzfp3y.png"" src=""""/></h3></div>","""We don't stop playing because we grow old, we grow old because we stop playing."" - George Bernard Shaw -OUR STORYThe Freebird Club idea was conceived in Glenbeigh, County Kerry (Ireland) when founder Peter Mangan started renting out his country cottage to visitors from around the world, using familiar accommodation websites such as Airbnb and Homeaway.

Seeing the enriching social benefits that his father was now enjoying prompted Peter to think how he could encapsulate and replicate this life-enhancing experience for the benefit of older adults everywhere. Fast forward 2 and a half years, and The Freebird Club is up and running as a global membership club for older adults, offering meaningful social engagement through travel and hosting opportunities. We now need funds to build a team and organisation that can truly deliver on our vision of an age-friendly and inclusive world. Your support will help us make the difference and improve the lives of older adults around the world. Founder Peter Mangan with his father Owen at home in County Kerry, Ireland. WHO WE ARE The Freebird Club is a travel-based social club for older adults, enabling positive 'connected ageing’ through social travel and homestays between members. Our mission is to connect and enrich the lives of older adults, fostering an age-friendly and inclusive world. Operating as a global peer-to-peer members club, we enable older adults to travel and stay with each other as part of a trusted community of socially minded peers. In doing so we offer a whole new way of travelling for older adults, a means to unlock asset value in their homes and earn extra income, and a fun accessible way to meet new people and enjoy social and cultural interaction in later life. PROBLEMS WE ARE TACKLING                                                    
Loneliness and isolation - one of the biggest issues facing older adults today, carrying significant health risks such as coronary heart disease, stroke and dementia.
Financial insecurity in later life - many seniors struggle with inadequate pensions
Lack of travel options for older people - research indicates many seniors would like to travel more but either lack companionship or the confidence to do it alone.
The ageing of society is a global phenomenon due to increased human longevity and falling birth rates. Globally the number and % of older persons (60+) is growing dramatically - from 900m in 2015 to over 2 billion by 2050. Globally 40% of older persons live independently (alone or with spouse only); in more developed countries the figure is c.75% (UN Dept of Economic & Social Affairs Population Report). In the UK, recent studies indicate that almost 1 in 6 adults over age 65 are chronically lonely. Healthwise, chronic loneliness has been correlated to smoking over 15 cigarettes a day and presents a higher health risk than obesity. OUR SOLUTION The Freebird Club provides a customised ‘age-friendly’ platform to enable older adults engage in peer-to-peer homestays and vacations with each other through an online membership club. Using the host/guest model, 'hosts' can make their spare rooms available to fellow members to come and stay for a nightly rate. Visits always involve staying with the live-in host present, as the emphasis is as much on the company as the accommodation. By creatively combining a travel site and a companionship site (where members have personal profiles describing themselves and their interests), we facilitate people finding people, not just a place to stay. INTERNATIONAL AWARDS

 OUR VISION & IMPACTOur vision is to create a more age-friendly, inclusive and ‘connected’ world for older adults. In our rapidly ageing society, there are more and more older adults dealing with loneliness and isolation. There are also increasing numbers of people struggling on inadequate pensions. These are not just unfortunate situations on an individual or human level, they also carry significant costs for society, tax payers and the economy. We want to do something about that. We want to contribute to a world where people no longer find themselves lonely or isolated or disconnected by virtue of their age. We want to enable financial independence and economic sustainability for older adults. We want to create a real movement - empowering and inspiring older adults to enjoy the world around them regardless of age. We are using the ‘sharing economy’ to achieve this. However our vision goes beyond the sharing economy, we want to champion a new ‘caring economy’, where people are what matter most, and the social impact is as important as the economic return. OUR TEAMOur Dublin-based team has now expanded to seven people, with staff working across marketing, web development and customer service. We also have a group of senior volunteers providing their time and skills to advance the project, as well as an international Strategic Advisory Board providing expert advice and guidance on all things ageing, innovation and enterprise development. In line with our positive ageing ethos, we have established a “50 Over 50” employment plan, whereby at least 50% of Freebird Club staff will be aged over 50. Not only is this an overt anti-ageism strategy, it also provides the company with unique insights and a ‘window’ into the particular challenges of our user demographic, as well as a more empathetic customer support ethos. OUR PROGRESS & PLANSFollowing a successful pilot phase in 2016, we formally launched the Freebird Club in April 2017. Already we have over 1500 Freebird members in 38 countries worldwide, and membership is growing daily. While the original concept is based around individual members, we now want to build an ‘Organisational Portal’ to allow age organisations to join as affiliate members (eg. positive ageing organisations, charities, retirement clubs, societies, care homes, etc). Extending the Freebird Club to allow age organisations as members would enable us to have a much wider reach and impact. Through their association with such age organisations, we could engage the ‘harder to reach’ older adults who could benefit most from social interaction – i.e. those who might otherwise be excluded, due to extreme isolation, lack of tech skills, or health/mobility. Working with age organisations would also allow us to facilitate coordinated group trips for their clients/members, enabling them to stay collectively with friendly approved hosts in a particular community. This would result in a far more inclusive model, with potentially far greater social impact. WHAT WE NEEDWe have big plans and even bigger dreams to develop the Freebird Club to achieve the kind of impact that can really make a difference in people’s lives. We need to build a team and organisational infrastructure to do that. While we have been relatively successful in fundraising through grants and awards, we now need additional resources to get to the next stage - to fund our growth, and in particular the development of our new ‘Organisational Portal’. The funds will be used as follows:
Technology Development: We need to build a professional in-house technology and web development team. The Freebird Club has significant plans for product development, which require upgrading the infrastructure of the website and adding considerable new features. The Organisational Portal is a key part of this.
Marketing: Freebird is a global concept, and this is reflected both in the international press coverage and our awards/accolades to date. There are significant market opportunities that are ready to be capitalized on. Increase in marketing staff is essential if we are to scale up the business such that so we can target and service global markets.
Customer Service: The Freebird Club has stipulated its intention to provide ‘best-in-class’ customer service tailored to its older adult customer demographic. A core trained support team is needed to deliver on this.
 HOW YOU CAN HELP We have come this far on belief, hard work and limited resources. We now need help to write the next chapter. By contributing to our campaign, you can help us change the narrative on ageing, help people enjoy their ‘golden years’ and reduce the risk of loneliness in old age.If you are unable to contribute personally, please help us by sharing our campaign with your friends, family and community. Each share will be a building block for an age-inclusive world, and a better future for older adults everywhere. INTERNATIONAL PRESS COVERAGE",14.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>¿De qué trata la campaña?</h2>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>La Revolución Emocional nace de mi propia necesidad de tener relaciones más sanas</strong> con mis amigos, mis familiares, mi pareja y, especialmente, conmigo mismo. También nace <strong>de descubrir que todas las enfermedades físicas </strong>no pueden atenderse solamente con tratamientos físicos (acupuntura y auriculoterapia), sino que<strong> tienen una contraparte emocional</strong>: es imposible sanar el cuerpo si la mente y el alma están enfermos. Desde entonces se han logrado cosas increíbles. <strong>Actualmente existen más de 200,000 seguidores, cerca de 30,000 pacientes con testimonios sorprendentes y un promedio de 3,000 mensajes cada día</strong> a través de Facebook. <strong>Hoy quiero llevar estas reflexiones, técnicas y consejos por todo el país para que tú</strong>, donde estés, <strong>puedas aprender a amar en libertad</strong> y construir relaciones sanas. La cantidad de ciudades que visite depende del presupuesto recaudado, y en cada una se realizarán conferencias, consultas privadas para atender problemas de salud físicos y emocionales, así como cenas privadas con los seguidores, para conocernos mejor.<br/><br/>En resumen, quiero ayudar a muchas más personas a ser felices, a través de la salud física y emocional.  </p>

<h3>I'm Sam Houghton and I have spent 25 years of my life struggling with mental health issues including severe depression, severe anxiety, bulimia, OCD and other. I have been hospitalised a few times, my longest stay was for 16 months at aged 15 years. After all of these years of therapies and medications from professionals, I realised that most of my recovery had to come from within.</h3>
<p>I embraced self help and personal development and moved forward in great strides in my life, to eventually setting up my own business.</p>
<p>Having experienced so much adversity for a long period of time, I have a deep desire to use my experiences to empower others in their recovery and to reduce feelings of isolation, guilt and shame. I know of this all too well.</p>
<p>I wrote my book ""The Invisible Girl"" in February 2017, the words that had been inside of me for so long, flooded out of my and onto the pages.</p>
<p>I am an ambassador for a mental health charity and also speak publicly about my journey and share on social media. I volunteer with disadvantaged young people which I love as that is when my problems began.</p>
<p>I am currently creating some online courses to compliment my book and help people as much as I can, sharing what helped me away from professional medical help.</p>
<p>At least 1 in 4 people in the UK alone will experience a mental health problem each year, with eating disorders causing the most fatality within mental illness.</p>
<p>To ensure that this book was not just about my personal story, the last chapter is a collection of the insights from my struggles that will raise hope for those struggling at this moment and to help see challenges from a different perspective. It can also help carers, family and friends with an insight into the mind of a person struggling to get through mental illness. There is a large section which focusses on the teenage years which would be beneficial to many young people and their families and professionals. This book explores the impacts of challenging life experiences including relationships, motherhood, personality, family genetics and the psychiatric system.</p>
<p>There are so many people struggling, even with professional help,  and I want to reach out to as many as I possibly can. I learnt how to overcome my worst struggles, and through my business and my desire to help I have built up a decent sized following on social media. I will be sharing this project avidly on these platforms to raise the target required.</p>
<p>By contributing to the publishing of this book it will potentially enable thousands of readers, of all ages to share my story of hope, and keeping the determination to overcome any adversity leading to a far happier, peaceful and fulfilling life.</p>
<p>If you are not able to contribute then please share my pledge on social media using the indiegogo share tools. You can also follow me here:</p>

<p>I need £1000 to publish my book with a company that has a powerful ethos of empowering others in self development and self help.</p>
<p>This will go towards: Cover design, editing, isbn numbers, typesetting, printing and marketing.</p>
<p>To demonstrate my absolute gratitude I am including some rewards and the perks are:</p>

I wrote my book ""The Invisible Girl"" in February 2017, the words that had been inside of me for so long, flooded out of my and onto the pages.
I am an ambassador for a mental health charity and also speak publicly about my journey and share on social media. I volunteer with disadvantaged young people which I love as that is when my problems began.
I am currently creating some online courses to compliment my book and help people as much as I can, sharing what helped me away from professional medical help.
At least 1 in 4 people in the UK alone will experience a mental health problem each year, with eating disorders causing the most fatality within mental illness.
To ensure that this book was not just about my personal story, the last chapter is a collection of the insights from my struggles that will raise hope for those struggling at this moment and to help see challenges from a different perspective. It can also help carers, family and friends with an insight into the mind of a person struggling to get through mental illness. There is a large section which focusses on the teenage years which would be beneficial to many young people and their families and professionals. This book explores the impacts of challenging life experiences including relationships, motherhood, personality, family genetics and the psychiatric system.
There are so many people struggling, even with professional help,  and I want to reach out to as many as I possibly can. I learnt how to overcome my worst struggles, and through my business and my desire to help I have built up a decent sized following on social media. I will be sharing this project avidly on these platforms to raise the target required.
By contributing to the publishing of this book it will potentially enable thousands of readers, of all ages to share my story of hope, and keeping the determination to overcome any adversity leading to a far happier, peaceful and fulfilling life.

</h3><ul>
<li>
<strong>Do I have to score every single point, every single time?</strong> You may choose to score only certain aspects. For example, you may not be interested in scoring social behaviors, but keenly interested in tracking physiological changes. It's easy to customize each profile to suit your needs at that time. Unscored areas will be marked as ""unscored"" so it is clear that sections were not overlooked but selected to be left out.</li>
<li>
<strong>Can I share my subscription? </strong>Yes, you may share your subscription. Let's say you have 2 dogs, and your friend has 1 dog. Your Family 3 subscription will cover all three dogs. As the subscriber, you have the option to make your friend an authorized user on your account. Our Friends &amp; Family plan allows up to 15 dogs, ideal for a small group of friends (or a couple of serious dog lovers!) Choose the plan that best suits your needs.</li>
<li>
<strong>What happens if my dog is no longer owned by me or dies? </strong>When you no longer need a dog to be active on your account, you may delete her. That dog space is now available again on your subscription.</li>
<li>
<strong>If I delete a dog, what happens to his records? </strong>Before removing a dog from  your account, you will be able to export and download the entire cumulative record for that dog. In the case of veterinary practices or other professionals who are legally required to retain records, there is the option to designate a retention period for files in limbo.</li>
<li>
<strong>What if I go over the limit of my pricing level?</strong> Not a problem! The pricing tiers reflects the max you will pay for that many dogs. Additional dogs are charged at a modest per dog price. There does come a point, however, where it is more economical for you to bump up to the next tier.</li>
<li>
<strong>I want my portal to reflect my business. Can I customize the FAT™ portal?</strong> Yes! We know that professionals want to keep their brand in front of their clients. All Pro accounts include set-up and customization with logo, colors and more.</li>
<li>
<strong>Can my clients complete the FAT™ or will my staff or me have to help them?</strong> One reason we hired the experts at Polycot is their track record on effective, intuitive design (that also looks great!). FAT™ is designed to be intuitive and clear. You have a choice of asking clients to login to your portal, or, if necessary, a staff member can guide less technologically savvy clients through the process.</li>
<li>

</h3><p>FAT™ is the natural outcome of Suzanne's lifelong experience living with and caring for many animals. Her work emphasizes seeing each dog as an individual. <i><strong>See the dog!</strong></i> is a familiar phrase to her students and participants at her seminars.</p><p>As a professional trainer, she wanted a way to help dog owners and other professionals understand dogs in a detailed way, and to identify and track changes. There were no options available.</p><p>On a more personal level, as an animal owner who travels frequently, she worries each time she leaves her own animals. She knows this question all too well: ""Did I remember to tell them . . .?"" She wanted a better way to communicate with others.</p><p>Suzanne began developing FAT™ in 2014, refining it with feedback from a wide range of professional caretakers and dog owners. Each time she presented a ""road test"" version of FAT, people got really excited about the power and potential of this tool. What they appreciated was that the whole dog was reflected in that FAT™ profile. Many expressed their weariness with overly simplified scales that weren't detailed enough to be truly useful.</p><p>What Suzanne kept hearing was, ""Where do I sign up???"" People wanted this tool, ASAP!</p><p><strong>Making It Real</strong></p><p>It took months to find the right team (thanks Susan &amp; Bill!) who could make FAT™ a serious, robust application for widespread use. Suzanne has partnered with the experienced and talented <strong>Polycot Associates</strong>—web developers and fellow dog lovers—to bring FAT™ from an idea to reality.</p><p> </p><h3>

Created by professional trainer Suzanne Clothier, FAT™ helps you translate what you know about a dog into a powerfully informative profile.Each profile is a reflection of your dog in that moment, in that setting, under those conditions. You may create as many profiles as you like, whether that’s every day or every now and then. Each profile can be emailed, printed out or shared via URLs, and all profiles become a part of that dog’s record.Available as a subscription service, FAT™ will become the hallmark of knowledgeable and compassionate caretakers, whether dedicated owners or animal professionals. 
  WHO NEEDS FAT™?DOG OWNERSYou are the expert on your dog. How can you effectively share that knowledge with others caring for your pet? How can you gain knowledge and insight on your pet’s changing needs?FAT™ makes sure what you know about your dog can go with your dog, so you know all caretakers have the information they need to provide the best possible care. The easy to use format guides you through 15 different aspects of your dog’s behavior, and then creates a comprehensive FAT™profile.As someone with many animals, Suzanne knows all too well the worries about leaving a beloved companion in someone’s care. FAT™ addresses those worries.  Stop asking yourself “Did I remember to tell them…?” Use FAT™ to provide them with the information they need to know. DOG CARE PROFESSIONALSSo much important information goes into caring for any dog. Will you remember to ask all the right questions? Will you or your staff remember all the details, or recognize changes? FAT™ makes sure that up-to-date, detailed information about the dog stays with the dog.FAT™ was created to help professional caretakers, such as:
Veterinarians & Staff
Trainers & Behaviorists
Shelters, Rescues & Sanctuaries
Boarding & Daycare Facilities
Dog Sitters & Dog Walkers
Service & Guide Dog Organizations
Therapy & Service Dogs
Accurate, easily communicated information is vital to providing the best possible care. FAT™ profiles give you and your entire staff a world of current information about each dog. Avoid the confusion of interpretation and inexpert assessments. FAT™ provides clear, observation based information that keeps every one on the same page, and doing the best for the dog. 
  WHAT'S IN A FAT™ Profile?A FAT™ profile is created using a 15-point scale that assesses the dog's physiological, social and cognitive function. Each point is scored on a 0-10 scale, with specifics provided at every step. No guesswork or confusing interpretations, just clear objective information based in observation.The easy to use website guides you through specifics of scoring behavior and responses. You do not need to be an expert in dog behavior to use FAT™ -- just able to recognize what a dog does or does not do.SAMPLE PROFILE (Prototype - final design will vary)                            Color coding of each score point helps you quickly recognize the overall dog as well as critical details, and know, at a glance, any changes in the dog's condition/behavior. 
 HOW IT WORKSFAT™ is an online subscription service. The FAT™ interface is easy to use, requires no training and is available on multiple platforms and devices.Each subscriber has their own web portal, which is private and secure. Professional subscriptions can be customized to include logos and other business related information.Once a FAT™ profile has been created for that dog, it is stored in his cumulative online record. There is no limit to the number of FAT™ profiles that can be created for any dog in your subscription. Profiles may be shared via email or a link, or printed. Every account has many features that allow you to customize how your account and dog profiles may be used, shared or limited.Subscriptions are priced according to the number of dogs for whom profiles will be created. Our lowest tier allows for 3 dog profiles, and on up to 2000+ profiles for professionals and organizations. At any time, you may choose to remove a dog from your plan, freeing up that space for another dog.Subscriptions are designed to be very flexible in terms of users - multiple users are possible. Each subscriber can set permissions for their account so that FAT™ works for you and your needs. 
 CASE HISTORY VIDEOS
Case History #1 RUNEThis case history shows how FAT tracks the changes in a young puppy over a 17 day period as she shifts from dealing with a mild problem to needing veterinary care and back to healthy puppy. Case History #2 BOARDING KENNELHere's how a boarding kennel uses FAT™ for two dogs who have previously boarded with them. Changing needs are shared with FAT™'s effective at-a-glance team communication.

  FAQs


Do I have to score every single point, every single time? You may choose to score only certain aspects. For example, you may not be interested in scoring social behaviors, but keenly interested in tracking physiological changes. It's easy to customize each profile to suit your needs at that time. Unscored areas will be marked as ""unscored"" so it is clear that sections were not overlooked but selected to be left out.

Can I share my subscription? Yes, you may share your subscription. Let's say you have 2 dogs, and your friend has 1 dog. Your Family 3 subscription will cover all three dogs. As the subscriber, you have the option to make your friend an authorized user on your account. Our Friends & Family plan allows up to 15 dogs, ideal for a small group of friends (or a couple of serious dog lovers!) Choose the plan that best suits your needs.

What happens if my dog is no longer owned by me or dies? When you no longer need a dog to be active on your account, you may delete her. That dog space is now available again on your subscription.

If I delete a dog, what happens to his records? Before removing a dog from  your account, you will be able to export and download the entire cumulative record for that dog. In the case of veterinary practices or other professionals who are legally required to retain records, there is the option to designate a retention period for files in limbo.

What if I go over the limit of my pricing level? Not a problem! The pricing tiers reflects the max you will pay for that many dogs. Additional dogs are charged at a modest per dog price. There does come a point, however, where it is more economical for you to bump up to the next tier.

I want my portal to reflect my business. Can I customize the FAT™ portal? Yes! We know that professionals want to keep their brand in front of their clients. All Pro accounts include set-up and customization with logo, colors and more.

Can my clients complete the FAT™ or will my staff or me have to help them? One reason we hired the experts at Polycot is their track record on effective, intuitive design (that also looks great!). FAT™ is designed to be intuitive and clear. You have a choice of asking clients to login to your portal, or, if necessary, a staff member can guide less technologically savvy clients through the process.

What happens if I no longer use the services of a FAT™ professional? You will have the option to start your own personal FAT™ subscription and continue your dog's records without interruption.

Will all of my dog's caretakers send me a FAT™ profile when my dog is in their care? We intend for FAT™ to be a must-have service for serious professional caretakers. How each professional will utilize FAT™ is up to them. If your vet, boarding kennel, trainer, daycare or pet sitter doesn't subscribe to FAT™, you may choose to provide them with access to your FAT™ portal, and ask them to use it for your dogs.

Can I arrange for monthly payments? You may choose to pay by the month, or receive a discount for a yearly payment. Your choice!

Are there any guarantees? We always want happy customers who are completely satisfied. If at any time you wish to terminate your FAT™ subscription, we will gladly refund your pro-rated subscription fees, whether you were paying by the month or annually.

  WHO IS USING FAT™RESEARCH PROJECT at Carroll College, Helena MTErica Feuerbacher, M.S., Ph.D., BCBA-D, CPDT-KA is an Assistant Professor of Anthrozoology at Carroll College in Helena, MT.  There she leads the canine program in which students train and foster dogs during the academic year. She has earned awards for her behavior analytic research on dog behavior. Her research interests center on dog-human social interactions, improving shelter dog welfare, and assessing training techniques. The Project, start date Aug 2017:  ""As part of our undergraduate program, students foster shelter dogs for a year. Being able to understand how the dog is functioning in its environment and how that changes as it transitions from shelter life into home life is really important. Not only can we make better decisions for the dog, we can help adopters better prepare for changes in their dog after adoption.""To date, we have not had a good tool to track the dog's functioning and behavior and we do not know how dogs change after adoption. My hope is to help elucidate if and when we see changes in dogs that might be in line with the so-called post-adoption honeymoon period. FAT™ is a wonderful tool to allow us to track how dogs are functioning in their environment and changes that occur.""I am incredibly excited to be using this tool in my college course to have students track their foster dogs' functioning and use it to answer our research questions about honeymoon periods. FAT™ could be a powerful tool for researchers and owners to better understand dog behavior and its interactions with the environment, and to make the best decisions for our dogs."" These businesses are putting FAT™ into practice, and are among those who will serve as our Beta testers.                                                                    
 OUR STORY  
FAT™ is the natural outcome of Suzanne's lifelong experience living with and caring for many animals. Her work emphasizes seeing each dog as an individual. See the dog! is a familiar phrase to her students and participants at her seminars.As a professional trainer, she wanted a way to help dog owners and other professionals understand dogs in a detailed way, and to identify and track changes. There were no options available.On a more personal level, as an animal owner who travels frequently, she worries each time she leaves her own animals. She knows this question all too well: ""Did I remember to tell them . . .?"" She wanted a better way to communicate with others.Suzanne began developing FAT™ in 2014, refining it with feedback from a wide range of professional caretakers and dog owners. Each time she presented a ""road test"" version of FAT, people got really excited about the power and potential of this tool. What they appreciated was that the whole dog was reflected in that FAT™ profile. Many expressed their weariness with overly simplified scales that weren't detailed enough to be truly useful.What Suzanne kept hearing was, ""Where do I sign up???"" People wanted this tool, ASAP!Making It RealIt took months to find the right team (thanks Susan & Bill!) who could make FAT™ a serious, robust application for widespread use. Suzanne has partnered with the experienced and talented Polycot Associates—web developers and fellow dog lovers—to bring FAT™ from an idea to reality.
