<h3>Who and what is Pip &amp; Lola's?</h3>
<p>Well, the boring answer is that Pip &amp; Lola's is a Pittsburgh-area handmade soap company. This is true but that doesn't really explain to you WHO we are. Pip &amp; Lola's was started in 2011 in Seattle, WA by Samantha and Bruce Story-Camp (that's us - yes, that's really our name). Pip is the nickname of our youngest son and Lola is his older sister. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1614876117/emxjrsv75twmrf2dekep.png"" src=""""/>Poor Pip had every skin ailment known to man and would suffer with horrible bleeding rashes. Since Samantha (aka Sami aka The Soap Goddess) had been making soap for 5 years by that point, we researched like crazy to try to find a recipe that would work for his poor inflamed tush. Samantha is also an actress in her ""spare time"" and would make soaps as gifts for her cast mates. Over time more and more friends were requesting soaps and she was creating more and more recipes for Pip's rear and so ... you know, the rest is history.</p>
<p>Fast forward ten years: we find ourselves in Munhall PA just outside of Pittsburgh and (even though Sami swore she would never do this to herself again) we have one adorable little location on 8th Avenue in Homestead. Business is slow but steady and we are loving our growing, loyal fanbase. Then the COVID Pandemic hit.</p>

We offered up a 25% coupon code that will remain valid for the whole of this COVID crisis (12 months and counting). Online sales were consistent and local customers quickly adapted to door pickup and local delivery. Things were fine. Except one thing was nagging at us.  Since our first year, we have had our Suspended Soap Shelf for which customers can purchase soaps which we then match and donate when we get a bunch gathered together.  During lockdown, our customers really bringing it and we were able to donate 500 bars to food banks and homeless shelters in just a 2 month span.  We were also increasingly aware of the growing needs of domestic violence shelters. We knew that a time which was an annoyance for us was HELL for folks being forced to shelter in place with their abusers. We wanted to do whatever we could to help. We can't afford to write big fat checks.... but SOAP we can do.</p>
<p>Starting in August of 2020, for every TWO items that we sell each month we donate one full sized bar of soap to a local, regional or national domestic violence shelter or charity. In 2020, we were able to donate 3000 bars to Pennsylvania Domestic Violence shelters.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>At the beginning of 2021, we were approached to open not one but TWO locations. One of them is opening right after this campaign ends.<br/>SO how can you help and what's in it for you? Well... this. Up to this point, Sami has been doing all of the soapmaking practically by herself in small batches. We know this is not sustainable long term so she is teaching our employees how to make the soaps. This is the part where she admits to having improvised her way through it all these years in terms of equipment. All of our making equipment has been second hand and adapted from regular household kitchen machinery (crockpots and turkey roasters). When we were only making 25-30 bars at a time, this worked just great. Since we are growing, the local thrift store no longer has the type and size of equipment that we need to keep up with demand. Commercial soapmaking equipment is stupid expensive. Whereas a used roaster can make a 25 lb. batch, we really are needing equipment that can handle 100lbs and more at a time.</p>
<p>And here is where YOU come in. These are the items we are hoping to purchase through this campaign and the prices and uses thereof. This is also the order in which we would be purchasing these items.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lye Tank (20 gallon stainless steel lye tank for storing and dispensing the lye/water solution that is vital to the soapmaking process - the chemistry behind soap is awesome and a little terrifying) - $1800</li>
<li>Oil Melters (20 gallon stainless steel heated tank for keeping soaping oils melted in order to increase efficiency) - $1300 each - hoping for 3 tanks for our main three hard oils</li>
<li>Oil Melters (13 gallon - so this is basically the same as the above except that it has a flat bottom and we would be adapting it as a soap cooker instead. This would allow us to quadruple our current batch size. The alternative to this would be a steam kettle but those puppies are at minimum $8,000 or so EACH. We will make do) - $1100 - hoping for 3 for those 3 colored batches.</li>
<li>Industrial immersion blenders (These bad boys are 2.5 feet long and can reach the bottoms of above mention melters. These are needed to blend the soap mixture and add scents.) - $280 each. Definitely 1. Hoping for at least 2.</li>
<li>Larger scale soap molds (quadruple batch molds - soaps have to harden in molds for 24 hours before cutting. Larger molds allows us to mold up larger batches at once.) - $300</li>
<li>Commercial soap cutters. (We currently have one that can cut small loafs but if we end up doing larger and longer batches a longer soap cutter will become a necessity. They can cut up to 24 bars at once) - $225</li>
<li>Stretch Goal #1 - Soaping Oils (once we are able to purchase all of the above additional funds raised would be used to purchase these oils in 55 gallon drums which brings our cost per ounce down significantly).</li>
<li>Stretch Goal #2 - Essential Oils (Same as above. Purchasing these oils in larger quantities allows us to get more bang for our buck. For example, a 16 oz bottle of Lavender essential oil runs about $110 but we could purchase a 10 lb bottle for $380.)</li>
</ul>
<p>What is in it for you? Oh, friends. We have had the BEST time coming up with a long list of glorious Campaign specific items and experiences for you to enjoy for months and years to come. Everything from Mystery soaps to Soap Goddess original paintings. Every contribution from $5 - $1000 will get a shout out on our social media. Plus SO much more.</p>

<h3>The Impact You Can Make</h3>
<p>We hope it is pretty obvious the difference you can make. Not just for Sami and her poor hands (soapmaking is very physical work) but also for all of those Domestic violence survivors. We appreciate you reading this far more than words can possible express and hope you will join on our goal to reach 10,000 bars (or more) donated per year.</p>

<p>We know that there is always a chance we may not hit our goal. We know that we might have to just ""keep on keepin' on"" the way we have been and we are prepared for that but we hope that you are able to help us help others in any way you can.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We are all being bombarded on all ends from folks needing financial help. We get it. All we ask is if you can't make a contribution that you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please get the word out to your friends. Friends are more likely to contribute to causes that people they care about care about. Please share our campaign, like us on Facebook and Instagram, join our Facebook group or heck, even just purchase some soapy goodness. Every bit helps.</li>
<li>Don't forget to use the Indiegogo share tools. They are super helpful and make helping US simple and easy.</li>

<p><b>It seems we only talk about mental health in America when we lose a celebrity from depression or someone commits a terrible act of violence.  We view them as ""one of those people,"" and it is just not our concern.  We stigmatize those in <b>mental health resulting in people not seeking treatment.  </b></b></p>
<p>But mental health comes in all forms, from simple depression to isolation, phobias including agoraphobia, harm to self and more. Ultimately everyone is affected by mental health one way or another.   It seems as a nation we are on the verge of finally taking everyday, ""garden variety"" mental health seriously as politicians bring this topic to the national forefront.</p>
<p>Being Alive and Antioch University created a breakthrough mental health program that has made an amazing difference in people's lives while helping to ensure we bring an end to new HIV infections.  Our psychotherapy interns help intervene when someone in crisis and suicidal,  with clients who cut and self-inflict injury, those who suffer with very deep depression and a host of other psycho-dynamic issues.  How?</p>
<ul>
<li>Eliminating barriers to HIV treatment by dealing with survivor's guilt.</li> <li>Addressing internalized homophobia, isolation issues, religious and cultural barriers.</li> <li>Working through depression and anxiety caused by medication &amp; treatment.</li>
<li>Developing goals, working through co-factors including substance abuse, self- mutilation issues, harm reduction or other self destructive behaviors.</li>
<li>Returning clients to improved physical and mental health, getting them back to work or community, and assisting with re-socialization and integration.</li> </ul> <p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431506932/bljq8gw3zcn0pyiiyoc3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>Our clients have the highest success rates of maintaining their health and keeping their HIV viral loads to undetectable levels, keeping their CD4 Helper Immune Cells up and complying with adherence to their medication regimen.  This impacts community by insuring they are not spreading  HIV.  The community benefits with reducing HIV infection rates and all taxpayers benefit with reduced social service program burdens.</p>

<p>Did you know that the lifetime healthcare cost of treating someone with HIV is <b>$327,000.00</b> not including hospitalization?  That is the discounted rate and the majority of these costs are born by the taxpayers.  And did you know, for the first time in the 33 years of HIV history we can finally end new HIV infections? Absolutely!  You can help be part of history by getting those who are HIV Positive to achieve HIV undetectable viral load.  This, along with agencies who are doing prevention education, the new treatment as prevention (TasP) protocols, and the increasing availability of Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), we can end HIV infections within just a couple of years.</p>
<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>In service of all living with HIV/AIDS, and with histories rooted in social justice and the psychological liberation of LGBT people, Being Alive and the LGBT Specialization at Antioch University have become partners as “Antioch Alive”. Our aim is to bring awareness of one’s own inner LGBT-intelligence through counseling, workshops, social activities, and creative projects facilitated by student/intern practitioners trained in LGBT-Affirmative psychology.</p>
<p>The Antioch Alive program is the only program in the nation integrated with supportive care services for all clients resulting in amazing outcomes and achieving better health maintenance and self-advocacy than the national average.  In fact, 82% of all Being Alive clients remain HIV undetectable and in treatment compared to the national average of 29%.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why Do We Desperately Need More Rooms?</h3>
<p>We need additional treatment rooms to service our growing clients base.  Our reputation for unrestricted mental health treatment plans has produced amazing successes, but also has increased the number of clients seeking our services.  Referrals from other collaborating social service agencies have also increased the need for additional treatment rooms for counselors to see clients.</p>
<p>Imagine, you can have a direct impact of the mental health outcomes of men and women who seek the best in mental health services.  No other agency achieves the results that Being Alive does in mental health with client-members affected by HIV. Your support ensures that we end HIV infections!  We also believe that we can be the primary agent in helping one city, the City of West Hollywood, to be the first city in the nation to end new HIV infections by 2017.  Wouldn't you love to be part of this historic goal?  In fact, the City of West Hollywood officials love Being Alive because we are a direct client-member impact service agency.  Being Alive services all of Los Angeles County's 2,045 square miles.  However, there are an estimated 13,000 - 19,000 HIV positive people in LA County still not in treatment and not HIV undetectable.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Last year Being Alive had 8,749 client visits for services.  That is an astonishing number of client-members served all provided at No-Cost.  Most agencies provide mental health on a sliding scale.  But Being Alive provides this service at no cost for two main reasons:</p> <ul> <li>70% of client live below the FPG (Federal Poverty Guidelines).</li> <li>65% of our client-members are on fixed low income and have little to no money left over after rent, food and utilities.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <p> Being Alive's ""Antioch Alive"" mental health program is the only HIV and LGBT specialized program in the nation.  Our psychotherapist receive extensive intense training in HIV health issues, co-factors and medical adherence complications.  This specialized training makes our psychotherapists uniquely qualified to understand some of the additional barriers in mental health our client-members face.  The end result is that client-members have better outcomes in their mental health treatment.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431516692/fzqmubd2ycoefos4mxa7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>The results speak for themselves.  In fact, many HIV service agencies with their own mental health programs refer their clients to Being Alive.  Many clients have tried other mental health services at other agencies only to return to Being Alive feeling they get a better result.</p>
<p>Our client-members are not limited to the 26 weeks of treatment that other agencies hold to.  Each client-member is treated individually and the course of treatment is decided by the psychotherapist with clinical supervision guidance to aim for 26 weeks, but not limited to 26 weeks if treatment dictates otherwise.</p>
<p>Psychotherapy interns also provide</p> <ul> <li>Crisis Counseling for newly HIV diagnosed clients in mental health crisis.</li> <li>Provide mental health assessments of those brought into service</li>
<li>Ensure that Being Alive has a goal of ""No Waiting List"" for mental health services.</li> </ul>
<h3>Why Our Program Works</h3>
<div>Everyone at Being Alive is involved in our client-member healthy outcomes.  The goal is simple - to ensure that client-members get into HIV treatment, link to HIV services within Being Alive and to other HIV agencies, maintain medication adherence to ensure an HIV undetectable viral load to stop the spread of HIV, access our supportive care services to maintain good health, access our mental health services as determined by staff or when requested and to self advocate for medical literacy and health education.  Client-members are empowered to take charge of their health in ways that medical providers can't do alone.</div>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431514959/oblrwn7moyepc08cb8ay.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>How Funds Will Be Used</h3>
<p>At Being Alive delivering no-cost services to those in need, linking them to services and assisting client-members with access to care is paramount.  Everything we do is client-member centric.   So funds raised will go directly to the project build-out with minimal administrative expense and that is a matter of room rescheduling of client-members and their providers during the construction phase.  Because of HIPAA Privacy Laws, client-member appointments may require room reschedules during construction.  Being Alive uses a third party private communication access for client-provider messaging to comply with HIPAA laws.  This is the only administrative expense that will be allocated for the project.</p>

Absolutely!  You can help be part of history by getting those who are HIV Positive to achieve HIV undetectable viral load.  This, along with agencies who are doing prevention education, the new treatment as prevention (TasP) protocols, and the increasing availability of Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), we can end HIV infections within just a couple of years.
Mission
In service of all living with HIV/AIDS, and with histories rooted in social justice and the psychological liberation of LGBT people, Being Alive and the LGBT Specialization at Antioch University have become partners as “Antioch Alive”. Our aim is to bring awareness of one’s own inner LGBT-intelligence through counseling, workshops, social activities, and creative projects facilitated by student/intern practitioners trained in LGBT-Affirmative psychology.
The Antioch Alive program is the only program in the nation integrated with supportive care services for all clients resulting in amazing outcomes and achieving better health maintenance and self-advocacy than the national average.  In fact, 82% of all Being Alive clients remain HIV undetectable and in treatment compared to the national average of 29%.

Why Do We Desperately Need More Rooms?
We need additional treatment rooms to service our growing clients base.  Our reputation for unrestricted mental health treatment plans has produced amazing successes, but also has increased the number of clients seeking our services.  Referrals from other collaborating social service agencies have also increased the need for additional treatment rooms for counselors to see clients.
Imagine, you can have a direct impact of the mental health outcomes of men and women who seek the best in mental health services.  No other agency achieves the results that Being Alive does in mental health with client-members affected by HIV. Your support ensures that we end HIV infections!  We also believe that we can be the primary agent in helping one city, the City of West Hollywood, to be the first city in the nation to end new HIV infections by 2017.  Wouldn't you love to be part of this historic goal?  In fact, the City of West Hollywood officials love Being Alive because we are a direct client-member impact service agency.  Being Alive services all of Los Angeles County's 2,045 square miles.  However, there are an estimated 13,000 - 19,000 HIV positive people in LA County still not in treatment and not HIV undetectable.


We currently have 8 psychotherapy counselors seeing clients in 4 treatments rooms, also shared throughout the week with acupuncture interns, intake health educators, chiropractic interns, hypnotherapist, and a cosmetic doctor all volunteering their treatment services or service-learning hours.




Last year 3,517 client-members came to Being Alive for 8,749 service visits! Each week 8 psychotherapist provide 150 therapy sessions in just 4 rooms! 4 staff members play ""musical chairs"" with staff office rooms so that interns can meet in private consultation.
Adding 3 additional treatment rooms can reduce the room shortage to service providers and the expected 1,100 new client-members for this year and provide for additional rooms for our psychotherapists to meet the growing demands of added counseling sessions needed.
The cost to reconfigure the existing rooms, moving doors and separation walls is only $10,000.  This includes electrical, phone, network wiring, lighting, carpeting, painting and minimal decor.



The Impact
Last year Being Alive had 8,749 client visits for services.  That is an astonishing number of client-members served all provided at No-Cost.  Most agencies provide mental health on a sliding scale.  But Being Alive provides this service at no cost for two main reasons:  70% of client live below the FPG (Federal Poverty Guidelines). 65% of our client-members are on fixed low income and have little to no money left over after rent, food and utilities.     Being Alive's ""Antioch Alive"" mental health program is the only HIV and LGBT specialized program in the nation.  Our psychotherapist receive extensive intense training in HIV health issues, co-factors and medical adherence complications.  This specialized training makes our psychotherapists uniquely qualified to understand some of the additional barriers in mental health our client-members face.  The end result is that client-members have better outcomes in their mental health treatment.



The results speak for themselves.  In fact, many HIV service agencies with their own mental health programs refer their clients to Being Alive.  Many clients have tried other mental health services at other agencies only to return to Being Alive feeling they get a better result.
Our client-members are not limited to the 26 weeks of treatment that other agencies hold to.  Each client-member is treated individually and the course of treatment is decided by the psychotherapist with clinical supervision guidance to aim for 26 weeks, but not limited to 26 weeks if treatment dictates otherwise.
Psychotherapy interns also provide  Crisis Counseling for newly HIV diagnosed clients in mental health crisis. Provide mental health assessments of those brought into service
Ensure that Being Alive has a goal of ""No Waiting List"" for mental health services. 
Why Our Program Works
Everyone at Being Alive is involved in our client-member healthy outcomes.  The goal is simple - to ensure that client-members get into HIV treatment, link to HIV services within Being Alive and to other HIV agencies, maintain medication adherence to ensure an HIV undetectable viral load to stop the spread of HIV, access our supportive care services to maintain good health, access our mental health services as determined by staff or when requested and to self advocate for medical literacy and health education.  Client-members are empowered to take charge of their health in ways that medical providers can't do alone.


How Funds Will Be Used
At Being Alive delivering no-cost services to those in need, linking them to services and assisting client-members with access to care is paramount.  Everything we do is client-member centric.   So funds raised will go directly to the project build-out with minimal administrative expense and that is a matter of room rescheduling of client-members and their providers during the construction phase.  Because of HIPAA Privacy Laws, client-member appointments may require room reschedules during construction.  Being Alive uses a third party private communication access for client-provider messaging to comply with HIPAA laws.  This is the only administrative expense that will be allocated for the project.

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">What is Little Land?</span><br/>
</h3>
<p>Little Land is a place where kids can be kids… and where kids can grow, develop and interact with each other. Sometimes that may look like one-on-one therapy, other times it may be group sessions or open play. The Little Land concept was developed to revolutionize the way pediatric therapy is administered across our community and to make more developmental based play available to kids in our area.</p>
<p>At Little Land, we offer:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Pediatric Occupational, Speech and Physical Therapy</li>
<li>Open Play in an environment designed by therapists</li>
<li>Music and Art classes</li>
<li>Parent's Day and Night Out Programs</li>
<li>Birthday Parties and other events</li>
</ul>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>Why are we different?</h3>
<div>We've all been to an indoor playground, jumped in a bounce house and done flips on a trampoline. It was a ton of fun, right? Even though it is fun and helps tire a kid out, are your kids gaining anything from it? Are they developing while they play, socializing and developing themselves to be the best kid that they can be? </div>
<div>We're not trying to replace other indoor playgrounds, we just plan on offering something new and different. We (Ernie &amp; Debbie, aka the founders of Little Land) want to create a place that has all of the fun stuff, but also has a benefit for each kid that visits. Think of it this way; if you were to join a gym, would you want to be able to take part in activities or use equipment that helps your body develop, change and be the best that it can be? That's exactly what we want to have available for kids at Little Land!</div>
<div><br/></div>

They are professionals who are currently stuck eating unhealthy food from the Chinese Restaurant and Burger King and is ready for a change. They will be very happy to see a eatery like The Tea Room especially because it will have free wifi and seating. This will give them a place to sit and eat lunch comfortably.</p><p><b>About East New York:</b> The East New York area is not known to have eateries that focus on the customer. Most eateries in East New York are sweaty, grease spoon, places that serve their customer through a plastic glass. The furniture is worn, the people working there are tired, and the places are not renovated or modern exceptions to the new eateries in the gateway area which is a hassle to get to if you do not have a car. This area is also missing that creative appeal. There is no place to buy a good cupcake... In the first 3 months, we will try different brands out to see what our top five flavors are and will occasionally have a different kind to spice things up. Cupcakes are the new trend and we hope to also have big orders for people to purchase once we are opened around three months. The Tea Room is all about good energy, good ambiance, good customer service, and good presentation… All factors that are missing in the eateries nearby.</p><p><b></b></p><p></p><p><b><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1156025/files/20150117165224-Screen_Shot_2015-01-17_at_7.46.52_PM.png?1421542344"" src="""" style=""""/></b></b></p><p></p>This is a google maps picture of our location.

be simple but creative. There is no one in the area that will serve the kind of
foods that we serve. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We will also sell the
homemade fusion water for people who are on a diet. Also many different kind of
teas which include diet teas. We will stay up on all of the trends in the fast
casual dining industry such as Peter of Real Housewives of ATL new coffee
called, Peter’s Brew. We believe that our customers will love our trendy appeal
and will be introducted to products that they necessarily wouldn’t be normally
introduced to.</span><br/></p>
<p><b>What else will we do? </b>The Tea Room will also have
events such as open mic night (Brooklyn Idol) and Karaokee. We will also rent
the space out to people looking to have a quaint business or personal event
that promotes positivity such as a music related events, book signings,
retirement parties, brunch, and/or baby shower. </p>
<p><b>Why should customers shop with us?</b> Customers should do
business with us because we are from the neighborhood and because we have a
true love for the people and the community we serve. We are clean, we are cool,
we are young, we are hip, we are black owned, and we are professional.
Professionalism is a must in order to grow and thrive for years to come. We
have free WIFI (with no problems logging on), great food, television, reading
materials, and hardworking people who work for our establishment. </p>
<p><b>What is our edge over the comps in the area? </b>Our edge over the
competition is that we are locally owned by an Entrepreneur/Author/TV
Personality who has been on television for five years and has over 100,000
followers collectively through Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. The Tea Room
Instagram page already has over 700 people following it. Tionna Smalls also has

</div></b></div>","Mission Statement: To raise the bar of the dining experience in an at-risk area. We service our customers with the highest regard of hospitality and humanity. Happy people serve happy people.Our Beliefs: The Tea Room believes in respect and integrity. We want our patrons to feel comfortable dining with us and feel uplifted because something like this is in their neighborhood. We believe in establishing a clean, professional, environment that serves not only the people who patronize us but the community in general.Our Target Customer: Our target customers are professionals 25-55 who work at the city appointed office down the street, the MTA worker, and the teachers who work in the schools. They are professionals who are currently stuck eating unhealthy food from the Chinese Restaurant and Burger King and is ready for a change. They will be very happy to see a eatery like The Tea Room especially because it will have free wifi and seating. This will give them a place to sit and eat lunch comfortably.About East New York: The East New York area is not known to have eateries that focus on the customer. Most eateries in East New York are sweaty, grease spoon, places that serve their customer through a plastic glass. The furniture is worn, the people working there are tired, and the places are not renovated or modern exceptions to the new eateries in the gateway area which is a hassle to get to if you do not have a car. This area is also missing that creative appeal. There is no place to buy a good cupcake... In the first 3 months, we will try different brands out to see what our top five flavors are and will occasionally have a different kind to spice things up. Cupcakes are the new trend and we hope to also have big orders for people to purchase once we are opened around three months. The Tea Room is all about good energy, good ambiance, good customer service, and good presentation… All factors that are missing in the eateries nearby.This is a google maps picture of our location. We are in between a barbershop and a beauty salon. As you can see this Cafe will be a good addition to the neighborhood!What we will serve: This location will serve
soups, salads, sandwiches, coffee, tea, oatmeal, cereal, custom drinks,
paninis, chicken and waffles, fast small plate foods but most of all DESSERTS. The foods will
be simple but creative. There is no one in the area that will serve the kind of
foods that we serve. We will also sell the
homemade fusion water for people who are on a diet. Also many different kind of
teas which include diet teas. We will stay up on all of the trends in the fast
casual dining industry such as Peter of Real Housewives of ATL new coffee
called, Peter’s Brew. We believe that our customers will love our trendy appeal
and will be introducted to products that they necessarily wouldn’t be normally
introduced to.
What else will we do? The Tea Room will also have
events such as open mic night (Brooklyn Idol) and Karaokee. We will also rent
the space out to people looking to have a quaint business or personal event
that promotes positivity such as a music related events, book signings,
retirement parties, brunch, and/or baby shower. 
Why should customers shop with us? Customers should do
business with us because we are from the neighborhood and because we have a
true love for the people and the community we serve. We are clean, we are cool,
we are young, we are hip, we are black owned, and we are professional.
Professionalism is a must in order to grow and thrive for years to come. We
have free WIFI (with no problems logging on), great food, television, reading
materials, and hardworking people who work for our establishment. 
What is our edge over the comps in the area? Our edge over the
competition is that we are locally owned by an Entrepreneur/Author/TV
Personality who has been on television for five years and has over 100,000
followers collectively through Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. The Tea Room
Instagram page already has over 700 people following it. Tionna Smalls also has
ties with the community and the press that is a recipe for success. Our other
competitive edge is that we will sell different kind of items that no one else
has. How many places can say they have homemade salad dressing or homemade jam?
Not any in this area. We are also hoping to make our own syrup later down the
line.

Final thoughts: This cafe' will be a great addition to the neighborhood and will bring up the value of the neighborhood. We will also bring great events and jobs to the neighborhood. We are opening a business that will be something the neighborhood can be proud of. We will also give back to the neighborhood by giving away free food to the less fortunate on Thanksgiving, back to school supply giveaways, and toy giveaways on Christmas.

<p><b><i>""Stress cannot exist in the presence of a pie.""</i></b> </p>
<p>---David Mamet</p>
<p>Powder River Pies has been a fixture at Farmers Markets and Trade Days, in Texas, since 2007. Honestly, though, I didn't start out to be a baker. I grew up in the saddle, up in the Texas panhandle. Then, one Thanksgiving, my Mom pulled up to my brother's house with two pecan pies in-hand. (She ALWAYS made at least ten pies, so I offered to fetch the rest.)</p>
<p>Mom said ""This is it. I only made two.""</p>
<p>There were 30 people in that house, waiting for the spread (and her pie) so --- rightfully --- I panicked. I asked her, ""What am I going to do for pie when you die?"" Her reply: ""Well, I guess you just better get with it.""<br/></p>
<p>And so, I did. I spent the day learning how to make her crust and pies. And I've made thousands of pies, since then. <br/></p>
<p>There have been many, many surprising results. I reckon the best compliment so far comes from my ex-wife who said ""<span style="""">the best thing about gettin' away from you is that I dropped 40 pounds."" (That's going on the website ..... HAR).</span></p>
<p>On the up side, I've gotten a few marriage proposals, strictly on the basis of my pies....so I guess it all evens out, in the long run. :&gt;)<br/></p>
<p>So, I guess you could say, Powder River Pies is a tip of the hat and a low bow to a grand gal, my Mom. She was a rodeo queen who broke her hip riding bulls, first rate cook, and a top hand at poker and didn't hesitate to teach you how to play every time she took a pot. <br/></p>
<p>I guess it's the same with the pies = she shared the recipe and the love, which are the key ingredients in all Powder River Pies, with me.</p>
<p>So I'd like to share them with you, and the world!<br/></p>
<br/>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need </h3> <p>Powder River Pies has been producing and selling some of the best pies anywhere, for eight years. Today, we 
are a destination at the Farmers Markets. People shop specifically for our pies. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1239947/files/20150222092045-Image.jpg?1424625645"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>Your 
funding will allow us to get to the next stage, and allow us to 
participate in more markets, and major venues, such as the State Fair of Texas.<br/></p>
<p>In that regard, the State of Texas has a Cottage Industry law that lets you bake in a residential 
kitchen. But, to take Powder River Pies to the next level, I need to secure a Certified Food
 Manager card and a commercial kitchen. <br/></p>
<p>Only then can we sell 
wholesale, on the Internet, and get FDA certified to sell across state lines.<br/></p>
<p>So here's the breakdown of what we need, financially:<br/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Pie Press                         $1,300  (Would allow me to produce 40 pies per hr)<br/>Lease/Deposits             $7,000  (Includes finish out)<br/>General Liability Insurance         $450  <br/>Logo/Website/Graphic Design/Video   $3000<br/>Convection Double Oven  $2500  (This would triple my baking output)<br/>Carts/Trays/Pans      $750<br/>20 qt. mixer                  $1500 (Now using a 1964, 5-qt Kitchen Aide)<br/>Stainless Steel Tables/Sinks   $1000<br/>Refrigeration               $3000 (Pies are cooled, shrink wrapped)<br/>Trailer                           $3,500  (To haul refrigerator and booth displays, so to facilitate my ability to sell pies at fairs, special events, etc.)<br/>Total Funding Needed                           <b>$25,000</b></span></p>

</div></div>","Short Summary






""Stress cannot exist in the presence of a pie."" 
---David Mamet
Powder River Pies has been a fixture at Farmers Markets and Trade Days, in Texas, since 2007. Honestly, though, I didn't start out to be a baker. I grew up in the saddle, up in the Texas panhandle. Then, one Thanksgiving, my Mom pulled up to my brother's house with two pecan pies in-hand. (She ALWAYS made at least ten pies, so I offered to fetch the rest.)
Mom said ""This is it. I only made two.""
There were 30 people in that house, waiting for the spread (and her pie) so --- rightfully --- I panicked. I asked her, ""What am I going to do for pie when you die?"" Her reply: ""Well, I guess you just better get with it.""
And so, I did. I spent the day learning how to make her crust and pies. And I've made thousands of pies, since then. 
There have been many, many surprising results. I reckon the best compliment so far comes from my ex-wife who said ""the best thing about gettin' away from you is that I dropped 40 pounds."" (That's going on the website ..... HAR).
On the up side, I've gotten a few marriage proposals, strictly on the basis of my pies....so I guess it all evens out, in the long run. :>)
So, I guess you could say, Powder River Pies is a tip of the hat and a low bow to a grand gal, my Mom. She was a rodeo queen who broke her hip riding bulls, first rate cook, and a top hand at poker and didn't hesitate to teach you how to play every time she took a pot. 
I guess it's the same with the pies = she shared the recipe and the love, which are the key ingredients in all Powder River Pies, with me.
So I'd like to share them with you, and the world!

   What We Need  Powder River Pies has been producing and selling some of the best pies anywhere, for eight years. Today, we 
are a destination at the Farmers Markets. People shop specifically for our pies. 



Your 
funding will allow us to get to the next stage, and allow us to 
participate in more markets, and major venues, such as the State Fair of Texas.
In that regard, the State of Texas has a Cottage Industry law that lets you bake in a residential 
kitchen. But, to take Powder River Pies to the next level, I need to secure a Certified Food
 Manager card and a commercial kitchen. 
Only then can we sell 
wholesale, on the Internet, and get FDA certified to sell across state lines.
So here's the breakdown of what we need, financially:
Pie Press                         $1,300  (Would allow me to produce 40 pies per hr)Lease/Deposits             $7,000  (Includes finish out)General Liability Insurance         $450  Logo/Website/Graphic Design/Video   $3000Convection Double Oven  $2500  (This would triple my baking output)Carts/Trays/Pans      $75020 qt. mixer                  $1500 (Now using a 1964, 5-qt Kitchen Aide)Stainless Steel Tables/Sinks   $1000Refrigeration               $3000 (Pies are cooled, shrink wrapped)Trailer                           $3,500  (To haul refrigerator and booth displays, so to facilitate my ability to sell pies at fairs, special events, etc.)Total Funding Needed                           $25,000
The purchasing plan is to buy the majority on the used/auction market. (For example, I just purchased a True Bar Back Cooler, online, for $100.00. They ordinarily retail for $1,800.00 new. So I know how to spend wisely!)

My humble beginnings.
...But It's Not All About Pie!
 I'm really fortunate. I have a great product. I love going out to the Markets and Fairs. It's a hoot. And I believe that I have been given a gift....not out of birthright, so much as strictly based on great good fortune. 
People may love the pies, but I love what the pies represent. 
For me, they are the way for me to bring what I have been given to others, and that can show other folks --- single moms who need a job and a safe place for their kids, people who got twisted up in life and don't think they can have a second chance, or anyone who has lost faith in themselves and what they can do --- to hire these people and instill a sense of pride and ownership in their jobs.
For you, that means MORE AND BETTER PIES. 
(So maybe, on that level, it really is all about the pie.)
   Lastly
Once you have tasted our pecan pie, in particular, you'll turn and slap your mate (or yourself, upside the head), and wonder ""HOW IS THIS GUY SINGLE???""* Well...I figure this Indiegogo campaign can, at least, get me on the right road.In all honesty, I have been told repeatedly that I make the very best Pecan Pie that you've EVER had. And so, I want the world to taste it. Look over my Perks. MORE TO THE POINT: My philosophy, is this --> ""If you don't think you have the best product on the market, quit. Get out. Do something else.""And a HEARTY THANK YOU, for taking the time to read this. There is so much more to say. You can always email me.
SPECIAL PERK: Everybody who ponies up on our funding have a standing invitation to drop by any fair we're at or drop by the kitchen, and get a 4"" pie on us. We'd love to see you. Plus, you get braggin' rights, to be able to point at our pies and say how you're one of our benefactors. 

We'll have a picture taken with you. And your....OUR...pies! And put it up on our Hall of Fame.Happy Trails,
Kirk ""The Pieman"" Pitman

textures and shapes.</span><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Traditional chocolate manufacturing machines have their limitations
when it comes to forming precise and complicated shapes and patterns. In
contrast, digital gastronomy, is allowing for the creation of flavors and
textures that is completely unimaginable through other cooking techniques. </p>
<p>Big food manufacturers and companies that sell households appliances
haven’t yet launched commercial-grade chocolate printers. We would like to be the first.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The 3D printer is equipped with a heated chocolate extruder and has a
syringe to create the final product. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Printed chocolate must be made with just the right application of
mechanical force, plus a well-designed digital “recipe” using raw ingredients
of the correct consistency. Raw ingredients must be soft enough to push through
a syringe tip, yet stiff enough to hold shape after being printed. To print
food, the printer must first be specially outfitted so it can work with edible
raw material.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Like any other 3D printed goodie, chocolate printing starts as a design
file. Food printing fans download their chocolate design file from a website or
create their own design files from scratch using engineering design software.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The machine is mainly controlled by the computer, consisting of automation material and ingredients storage, extrusion structure, delivery devices. It enables the user to pick up their favorite shapes from three-dimensional models stored in advance, as well as to design their own unique styles according to their preferences by using the software. After all these preparations, once they click on the “Print” button, the nozzles will evenly extrude chocolate “ink”, so as to form the nutritious, healthy and interesting chocolate shape layer by layer.<br/></p>

<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; text-align: justify; background-color: initial;"">To start, you have to put the chocolate chips into the hopper, the piston driven by double screw motor will squeeze the chocolate chips downward. When chocolate chips are pushed to the heating devices, the temperature will rise as high as 40 degrees Celsius. At this time, the solid chocolate will transform into liquid. Then the nozzle, with a diameter of 4 mm, will extrude liquid chocolate to form a real chocolate structure. When it’s done, you can take the printed chocolate away carefully and refill the syringe with
chocolate for the next build, or could simply discharge the remaining
chocolate out form the syringe to keep as back up.</span><br/>
</div>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The printed chocolate dries naturally. When the chocolate cools back to
room temperature, it will harden again. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">As for the screen, you can use it to adjust the temperature &amp;

</div></div>","Say hello to the first commercially available chocolate 3D printer on
the market. You won’t have to wait any longer to be able to print out custom
chocolate shapesstraight from your own space! Print Arsenal is now ready to
sell its first working prototype for as low as $3,800. It prints out custom designs in dark, milk & white chocolate. We need your help to redesign our chocolate
3D printer to include better features! We are building a product that has never been made available to consumers before!  
We are now using 3D technology to bring chocolate goodness to consumers in unanticipated and exciting ways. 3D printing gives consumers nearly endless possibilities for personalizing their chocolate, and we look forward to continued development of this amazing technology.
Our amazing team of experienced & skilled engineers in NYC has helped us bring this printer to life, now it's your turn to help us fund it!




""CocoJet already has some competition. Print Arsenal launched an Indiegogo campaign just this week to make its $3,800, cocoa bean-liquefying 3-D chocolate printer prototype a reality. Let the 3-D printed chocolate wars begin. We’re happy to sample the spoils."" - Yahoo! Finance 




""CocoJet is going to face some tough competition as Print Arsenal has also launched an Indiegogo campaign, a global crowdfunding engine. Print Arsenal, with the help of the funds, hope to make a cocoa bean-liquefying 3D printer."" - International Business Times 








""If you saw something flying out the window just now as I revved up the car and took off, don’t bother to pick it up. It was just my mental New Year’s resolution fluttering away in the wind, firmly listing all the reasons I was never planning to eat anything enjoyable again — like sweet, delectable blocks of chocolate. After considerable time spent studying the Print Arsenal chocolate 3D printer this morning, I decided maybe cutting out the good things in life is not such a smart idea — not this week, anyway."" - 3D Print
http://3dprint.com/35540/printer-arsenal-indiegogo/

                                                       










Print Arsenal's Chocolate 3D Printer is fitted with a twin-screw extruder, so that you would print out a chocolate pattern within a few minutes. Moreover, the printing size is relatively large, the maximum printing size is 100mm * 150mm * 100mm.





The chocolate 3D printer allows you to design custom chocolates and
offer them fresh. You can model chocolate into aesthetically pleasing and delectable
textures and shapes.
Traditional chocolate manufacturing machines have their limitations
when it comes to forming precise and complicated shapes and patterns. In
contrast, digital gastronomy, is allowing for the creation of flavors and
textures that is completely unimaginable through other cooking techniques. 
Big food manufacturers and companies that sell households appliances
haven’t yet launched commercial-grade chocolate printers. We would like to be the first.
The 3D printer is equipped with a heated chocolate extruder and has a
syringe to create the final product. Printed chocolate must be made with just the right application of
mechanical force, plus a well-designed digital “recipe” using raw ingredients
of the correct consistency. Raw ingredients must be soft enough to push through
a syringe tip, yet stiff enough to hold shape after being printed. To print
food, the printer must first be specially outfitted so it can work with edible
raw material.
Like any other 3D printed goodie, chocolate printing starts as a design
file. Food printing fans download their chocolate design file from a website or
create their own design files from scratch using engineering design software.
The machine is mainly controlled by the computer, consisting of automation material and ingredients storage, extrusion structure, delivery devices. It enables the user to pick up their favorite shapes from three-dimensional models stored in advance, as well as to design their own unique styles according to their preferences by using the software. After all these preparations, once they click on the “Print” button, the nozzles will evenly extrude chocolate “ink”, so as to form the nutritious, healthy and interesting chocolate shape layer by layer.


                

                                       



To start, you have to put the chocolate chips into the hopper, the piston driven by double screw motor will squeeze the chocolate chips downward. When chocolate chips are pushed to the heating devices, the temperature will rise as high as 40 degrees Celsius. At this time, the solid chocolate will transform into liquid. Then the nozzle, with a diameter of 4 mm, will extrude liquid chocolate to form a real chocolate structure. When it’s done, you can take the printed chocolate away carefully and refill the syringe with
chocolate for the next build, or could simply discharge the remaining
chocolate out form the syringe to keep as back up.

The printed chocolate dries naturally. When the chocolate cools back to
room temperature, it will harden again. As for the screen, you can use it to adjust the temperature &
select the design from the SD card; it reads SD cards.

  




We live in a technical world where technology leaps are occurring very
rapidly. Print Arsenal’s focus is to keep up with the current market and to
constantly deliver you the latest high-end 3D printing technology.
Therefore, your contribution on Indiegogo.com will allow us to redesign
our chocolate 3D printer, add amazing new features and invest in marketing.
Further, we will develop a fully customized website that will have a custom software integrated
into it which will be open-sourced. We will offer a wide variety of STL files on the website. We will set up an excellent customer service to guide you every step of the way and to be able to
browse our website with ease. We will establish a program that will largely
rely on feedback from our customers in terms of improvement suggestions; we
will seek for your input & ideas during our progress to ensure effective
operations.
Investing in a local factory in New York will also be
necessary to provide a quick and adequate supply of our product in order to keep up with growing sales. 
Finally, we will continue to invest in developing new affordable & unique
printers that won’t be available anywhere else. 




               
               

           



The chocolate 3D printer will allow chocolate artists, companies & pastry chefs to grow their clientele by giving them the opportunity to print out as many different chocolate shapes as they'd like at any given moment. 
Also, chocolate is the favorite food for many children. There are many chocolates for sale at stores, but none of them have your favorite custom shape. Our chocolate 3D printer is the solution.




We have worked with the printer & tested it several times. It functions perfectly. We don't anticipate delays in production and shipping, but will communicate to you if any occur.  We currently have a few complete operating prototypes and are establishing plans for commercial manufacturing.
Planned additional features & colors, software & hardware improvements, and future support will depend on continued success of the campaign with users like you and the developer community.

<p>If you could eat healthy – truly healthy – would you? Of
course you would! And i<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">f you have children, you'd want them to eat healthy, too. Any parent wants the best for their kids.</span></p><p>Unfortunately, due to the lack of food outlets that sell fresh produce in urban areas and the 
cost of organic produce in the places that do, truly eating healthy in urban America is not a realistic option for many.</p><p>Even those who are able to 
buy fresh are not getting the flavor and nutrients they need due to GMOs and immature harvesting. Let's face it, produce
these days, just isn’t what it used to be. </p>
<p><strong>Enter SuperGrow™.</strong> We’re a company that has taken the
concerns of nutritious produce to heart and have patented a technology that allows fresh, local, organic produce to be grown in soil, any season, anywhere … even in urban areas where it’s needed most.</p><p><strong>Enter Boys &amp; Girls Clubs.  </strong>Boys &amp; Girls Clubs across America are often located right at the heart of urban centers and are already educating children with their core program, <i>Healthy Habits</i>. They're expanding this education by sharing it with the families, as well, through <i>Family Plus</i>.  </p><p>SuperGrow™ is working with the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Greater Lee County, Alabama, to pilot <strong>a program which we believe will have high impact </strong>on the lives of the children at their Auburn and Opelika locations, touching the lives of their <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">families and communities as well.  What we initiate here, too, </span><strong style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">has the potential to be replicated through Boys &amp; Girls Clubs across the United States.</strong><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p><p>_____________________________________________________________________________</p><p></p>

<h3>What Is SuperGrow and How Can It Help?</h3>
<p>We at SuperGrow™ are forerunners in urban farming
technologies and methods. We have developed a patented grow method  called “terraponics” that
allows produce to be grown <i>indoors, year-round,</i><i> in soil</i> – <i>not hydroponically or aeroponically.</i> This,
we do in converted shipping containers called SuperGrow Containers™ or  buildings converted
with the same technology called SuperGrow Centers™. These can be positioned <i>locally</i> right in the urban areas, themselves, by the establishments that serve the community.</p>
<p></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1358664/files/20150406035513-james-container.jpg?1428317713"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Through our grow method, the result is produce that is free of
pesticides, protected from the harmful impacts of the environment, 100% organic, free of GMOs, and grows in about half the time with predictable yields. We have virtually zero harvest lost due
to spoiling or transportation. 98% of our produce is given a #1 rating for
perfect size and shape. And, best of all, the flavor and nutrients are
truly exceptional.</p>

Greater Lee County is so important to us.</p>
<p style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Through this program – <i>and with your help</i> – we aim to provide the boys and girls with a grow center of their own … right on their premises. </p>

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">By converting one of their existing storage rooms, we’ll be able to set

<p style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">With your help we will equip the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs with our soil-based racking system, LED grow lights, watering, composting,

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Most important, however, is the kids will not only get to
learn to eat healthy, but they’ll be taking on a sense of responsibility.
Through the program, they’ll learn about setting and accomplishing goals. In
addition to the produce that they’ll keep for themselves, they’ll in fact be
planting, growing, and harvesting produce for local restaurants as well. This
means, meeting deadlines and working closely as a team. They’ll be learning – </span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">in a fun way</i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> – how to face challenges
and grow something they can be proud of. And as they grow, so does their
confidence. They’re not just gaining a healthy diet through this program, they’re

</div></div>","Our World Today
If you could eat healthy – truly healthy – would you? Of
course you would! And if you have children, you'd want them to eat healthy, too. Any parent wants the best for their kids.Unfortunately, due to the lack of food outlets that sell fresh produce in urban areas and the 
cost of organic produce in the places that do, truly eating healthy in urban America is not a realistic option for many.Even those who are able to 
buy fresh are not getting the flavor and nutrients they need due to GMOs and immature harvesting. Let's face it, produce
these days, just isn’t what it used to be. 
Enter SuperGrow™. We’re a company that has taken the
concerns of nutritious produce to heart and have patented a technology that allows fresh, local, organic produce to be grown in soil, any season, anywhere … even in urban areas where it’s needed most.Enter Boys & Girls Clubs.  Boys & Girls Clubs across America are often located right at the heart of urban centers and are already educating children with their core program, Healthy Habits. They're expanding this education by sharing it with the families, as well, through Family Plus.  SuperGrow™ is working with the Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Lee County, Alabama, to pilot a program which we believe will have high impact on the lives of the children at their Auburn and Opelika locations, touching the lives of their families and communities as well.  What we initiate here, too, has the potential to be replicated through Boys & Girls Clubs across the United States. _____________________________________________________________________________
Did You Know …     •  23.5 million Americans
lack reasonable access to fresh produce.     • 50% of Birmingham, AL is classified by USDA as an Urban Food Desert     • Auburn, AL has an Urban Food Desert located contiguous to the University_____________________________________________________________________________

 In fact 1 in 4 children in this area are food insecure, meaning they’re
not getting the vitamins and nutrients they need. 
An average 3 out of 10 kids are overweight or obese, putting them at risk for health problems
throughout their lives.

What we do together here can have a resounding effect in our nation.

What Is SuperGrow and How Can It Help?
We at SuperGrow™ are forerunners in urban farming
technologies and methods. We have developed a patented grow method  called “terraponics” that
allows produce to be grown indoors, year-round, in soil – not hydroponically or aeroponically. This,
we do in converted shipping containers called SuperGrow Containers™ or  buildings converted
with the same technology called SuperGrow Centers™. These can be positioned locally right in the urban areas, themselves, by the establishments that serve the community.


Through our grow method, the result is produce that is free of
pesticides, protected from the harmful impacts of the environment, 100% organic, free of GMOs, and grows in about half the time with predictable yields. We have virtually zero harvest lost due
to spoiling or transportation. 98% of our produce is given a #1 rating for
perfect size and shape. And, best of all, the flavor and nutrients are
truly exceptional.



_____________________________________________________________________________

More Important Facts You Should Know ...     •  About 5% of all crops fail each year without catastrophic weather events
     •  Between 45% to 68% of many produce items spoil between the time          they are harvested and the time they're sold at retail.

     •  Up to 20% more produce spoils at the retail outlet or restaurant prior          to purchase.


_____________________________________________________________________________


Our greatest desire is to positively 
impact communities. That’s why teaming with the Boys & Girls Clubs of
Greater Lee County is so important to us.
Through this program – and with your help – we aim to provide the boys and girls with a grow center of their own … right on their premises. 



By converting one of their existing storage rooms, we’ll be able to set
them up with the same technology we use in our SuperGrow Containers™ and
SuperGrow Centers™ and allow the kids to learn and enjoy growing their own produce. Since we are soil-based, what the children learn and experience is easily transferable.
They’ll gain skills and knowledge they can use at home and carry the rest of
their lives.  
With your help we will equip the Boys & Girls Clubs with our soil-based racking system, LED grow lights, watering, composting,
and air management systems. We’ll be able to apply this to small rooms or closets.
In fact, we’ve already tested this approach with 2nd and 4th
graders in a local 4H program so we’re confident it will work with the Boys
& Girls Clubs as well.


Most important, however, is the kids will not only get to
learn to eat healthy, but they’ll be taking on a sense of responsibility.
Through the program, they’ll learn about setting and accomplishing goals. In
addition to the produce that they’ll keep for themselves, they’ll in fact be
planting, growing, and harvesting produce for local restaurants as well. This
means, meeting deadlines and working closely as a team. They’ll be learning – in a fun way – how to face challenges
and grow something they can be proud of. And as they grow, so does their
confidence. They’re not just gaining a healthy diet through this program, they’re
gaining a healthy attitude. They’re learning to be Great. 
What Are the Risks?

Who is Leading? Of course, before  supporting any venture,
you want to make sure the people behind it can deliver what is promised and have integrity as well as good business and social impact sense.  Although we’re
still a start-up company, we have a foundation of success you can depend on.


Let’s begin with our CEO, James Massa. James is a long-time
veteran of success. For 25 years he was an executive in the high-tech industry
helping 3 start-up companies achieve their initial public offering goals.  For 14 years he worked with Cisco Systems,
finishing his term there as VP and Chief Strategist of Global Government
Solutions. He has served the nation on the National Security Telecommunications
Advisory Council to the President of the United States as Chairman of the
Internet Architecture Task Force. And if that isn’t enough, he’s been named by
USA Today as a leader in Social Impact.

James lives out Cisco’s theme of changing the way people
live, work, play, and learn. He sets his sights on creating platforms that
provide sustainable solutions for essential needs. His heart, and ours, is to
help others impact their communities, through sustainability, in a way that can
be duplicated globally.
Who is Helping?  James has assembled a team of highly motivated, like minded, young men and women with degrees in agriculture, sustainability, business, human sciences, and more.  To this he has added seasoned veterans in disciplines ranging from forestry to marketing to the hospitality industry.  



What is the track record so far?  With regard to SuperGrow™ as a whole, we have been growing
in success since 2010.  We have had a clear vision forward and achieved planned milestones along the way. Our initial roots comprised
of developing prototypes and refining methodologies. (click here to see a larger view of the diagram to the right). 
We have since advanced  our patent on terraponics and are providing produce weekly 
for local restaurants in the Auburn area, with ever-increasing  demand. To fulfill the requirement to meet
this demand, we are opening our first SuperGrow Center™ this summer, with a
vision to take things not just nationally, but globally. 
By supporting this program with the Boys & Girls Clubs, you will be investing in
a purpose that touches communities far and wide, and it starts with the
children. Together we can impact them, and provide for their needs.  What you do to touch the life of a child impacts society.

This will also be used to help enhance the current SearchCo.info website and build the future mobile application. Our marketing campaign will include the following:</p> <ul> <li>Advertising in newspaper, magazines, radio and online publications</li> <li>Local guerrilla marketing campaigns and grassroots advertising through events and interest meetings</li> <li>Social media and keyword advertising, such as Facebook Ads, Google Ads, and Instagram</li>
<li>Promotional merchandise</li>
<li>Affordable Billboard &amp; Metro Ad space</li> </ul> </div> <div> <p>These ads will be launched in Virginia, New York, Miami, Philadelphia Washington DC, and Atlanta. </p>
<p><b>Guerrilla Marketing &amp; Street Team</b></p>
<p>SearchCo will hire 5-6 local promotional models per location to help distribute promotional materials such as flyers, posters and free merchandise for one or two day events. We will also facilitate the on-site sign up for the SearchCo.info site via laptop, mobile or tablet.</p>
<p><b>Business Events and Interest Meetings</b></p>
<p>SearchCo will have weekly interest meetings to provide SearchCo services to local businesses. These meetings will be promoted using radio, social media and email marketing. We will explain how the site and app work, how to sign up, our affiliate program, and adverting options and rates. This will not only expand our brand, but explain the benefits of using our system over other websites and services. </p>
<p><b>Social Media &amp; Online Advertising</b></p>
<p>SearchCo will advertise daily through social media and online platforms such as Google Ads, Facebook Ads, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Craigslist and Linkedin. This will expand our network and allow our site and app to increase traffic exponentially, gain first time and repeat customers, and increase ad sales. </p>
<p><b>Print, Radio and Online Publications</b></p>
<p>SearchCo will run advertising in local newspapers, magazines, radio and online publications, including select major publications, such as the Wallstreet Journal and Washington Post. This will expand our brand's visibility and help SearchCo.info become a trusted business information and networking resource. </p>
<p><b>Affordable Billboard &amp; Metro Ad space</b></p>
<p>SearchCo will also advertise in select local areas using billboard and regional public transportation ad space provided through CBS and other ad space providers. This will further increase our brand and make it easy for consumers to recognize the SearchCo logo and advertising. It will also allow us to compete on the same level as other sites that provide similar services such as Monster, Craigslist, and Angie's List. </p>
<p><b>Further Website &amp; App Development</b></p>
<p>With any website business, you have to stay ahead of the curve to remain relevant and provide the highest quality of services that customers deserve. With your help, we will be able to improve our current website and finish the development of our mobile application through Apple and Google Play. This will allow more people to have  access to our services and expand our network. It will also cover the expenses of web development, coding, and design. </p>
<p><b>What You Get</b></p>
<p>We want everyone to feel like they are a part of the SearchCo.info brand.  Anyone who donates at least $1 will receive a certificate thanking them for their help. People who donate $10 or more to our cause will receive a SearchCo pen and notepad as a thank you for your contribution. You will also be listed on our website. </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>By donating to our campaign, SearchCo will expand and grow into a national and international business network. We have been able to provide advertising and marketing services to small and major businesses over the past 10 years. Our goal is to take our expertise from local to a national and worldwide level by growing our brand and advertising reach. Every business wants to utilize as many free resources as possible before having to spend their own capital. By providing these services and discounted paid options, it will empower every business, big or small, to expand their business through an easy system such as SearchCo.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>The challenge we face as a new company is that there are other businesses that provide similar services. Craigslist provides job listings and classifieds. Monster.com provides job listings. Angie's List provides information for local businesses. And Google and Yahoo provide an overall web search for business keywords. The problem is none of the sources include every feature a business would need in a easy to use platform. SearchCo provides all the business resources a company could need all-in-one. The only thing that separates us from our competition is having the capital to make our brand visible. With your help, we will defeat this obstacle.  </p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you are unable to help monetarily, please share this campaign on your social media and blogs to help us spread the word. Let's help make SearchCo the best resource for business information on the web!</p>

We will explain how the site and app work, how to sign up, our affiliate program, and adverting options and rates. This will not only expand our brand, but explain the benefits of using our system over other websites and services. 
Social Media & Online Advertising
SearchCo will advertise daily through social media and online platforms such as Google Ads, Facebook Ads, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Craigslist and Linkedin. This will expand our network and allow our site and app to increase traffic exponentially, gain first time and repeat customers, and increase ad sales. 
Print, Radio and Online Publications
SearchCo will run advertising in local newspapers, magazines, radio and online publications, including select major publications, such as the Wallstreet Journal and Washington Post. This will expand our brand's visibility and help SearchCo.info become a trusted business information and networking resource. 
Affordable Billboard & Metro Ad space
SearchCo will also advertise in select local areas using billboard and regional public transportation ad space provided through CBS and other ad space providers. This will further increase our brand and make it easy for consumers to recognize the SearchCo logo and advertising. It will also allow us to compete on the same level as other sites that provide similar services such as Monster, Craigslist, and Angie's List. 
Further Website & App Development
With any website business, you have to stay ahead of the curve to remain relevant and provide the highest quality of services that customers deserve. With your help, we will be able to improve our current website and finish the development of our mobile application through Apple and Google Play. This will allow more people to have  access to our services and expand our network. It will also cover the expenses of web development, coding, and design. 
What You Get
We want everyone to feel like they are a part of the SearchCo.info brand.  Anyone who donates at least $1 will receive a certificate thanking them for their help. People who donate $10 or more to our cause will receive a SearchCo pen and notepad as a thank you for your contribution. You will also be listed on our website. 
The Impact By donating to our campaign, SearchCo will expand and grow into a national and international business network. We have been able to provide advertising and marketing services to small and major businesses over the past 10 years. Our goal is to take our expertise from local to a national and worldwide level by growing our brand and advertising reach. Every business wants to utilize as many free resources as possible before having to spend their own capital. By providing these services and discounted paid options, it will empower every business, big or small, to expand their business through an easy system such as SearchCo.

Risks & Challenges The challenge we face as a new company is that there are other businesses that provide similar services. Craigslist provides job listings and classifieds. Monster.com provides job listings. Angie's List provides information for local businesses. And Google and Yahoo provide an overall web search for business keywords. The problem is none of the sources include every feature a business would need in a easy to use platform. SearchCo provides all the business resources a company could need all-in-one. The only thing that separates us from our competition is having the capital to make our brand visible. With your help, we will defeat this obstacle.     Other Ways You Can Help If you are unable to help monetarily, please share this campaign on your social media and blogs to help us spread the word. Let's help make SearchCo the best resource for business information on the web!",2.0,0,"2 Campaigns

Madeira and I have been living and working abroad for 6 years… </p>
<p>After taking my driving licence I started to look
for ways to move around Madeira Island when on Holiday. I’m a big fan of two
wheels however I have been very shocked by the rental prices on the island, I didn’t
expect to pay more to rent a scooter than a car. But that was the reality at that
time and also the reason why I decided to set up my own business at the end of
2014.<br/>
<br/>
We are the first Low Cost scooter rental on the island. <b>However our
fleet is currently very small (6)</b> which limits our ability to have
even lower prices.<br/>
<br/>
This fundraising is the occasion for you to give us a hand to purchase  4 new 125cc scooters, each of them costing
2899€ (this price includes: Scooter, Registration and other legal fees,
Insurance, Top Case and 2 Helmets).<br/>

Helping us is helping anyone that visits the island and wants to rent a scooter

<h3>Our Vision</h3>
<p>Cultiwate’s vision is to become a one-stop shop for talented
filmmakers using our powerful digital content curation ecosystem that will help
filmmakers with rich, diverse and quality content to get the right exposure and
maximize revenue streams. And, also help filmmaker's transition to the big
screen through mentorships, internships and incubation.</p>
<p>Cultiwate will provide
a reliable platform for all talents in the Film Business to showcase their skills
that will pave way for providing them the much-needed break in the mainstream
business thereby realizing our vision to be a powerful curation ecosystem.</p>
<p>Cultiwate will be the first ever curation cum incubation hub for Virtual Reality (VR) Content. We will be distributing VR content through our Cultiwate VR platform accessible via a plethora of VR headsets. We curate the best of the VR content submitted by filmmakers and monetize it on behalf of filmmakers. Apart from curating, Cultiwate will also develop and produce exclusive content in the VR space with the filmmakers from our network. </p>
<p>While giving the filmmakers the well-deserved exposure, Cultiwate also helps them monetize their short
films through multiple streams of distribution platforms ranging from
our own in-house Cultiwate Ad-based Streaming, theatrical screenings, In-Flight
and Cruise Entertainment to leading new media distributors like Amazon Instant,
Hulu, Netflix and YouTube, thereby helping them recoup their existing
investments. And, in this process, Cultiwate will charge a flat 30%
distribution fee for facilitating and negotiating the deals. </p>
<p>Cultiwate will also
provide affordable services for filmmakers ranging from Subtitling, Dubbing,
Building Apps &amp; Website, Drafting and Filing Copyright, Editing a unique trailer, Designing Titles and Poster for
their short films in the platform, thus Cultiwate will be an exclusive 'Fiverr' for the Film Industry.  Later on we intend to bring in VFX
services to the platform. </p>
<p>Cultiwate will provide
a submission platform to various film festivals worldwide
with a 1-click submission process from within the website at highly discounted
prices or for free. We have struck deals with various film festivals (and in
the process of adding more). The pricing (if discounted) on Cultiwate is exclusive and we do not charge filmmakers for online screeners hosting
unlike competitors like Withoutabox (Amazon) and Film Freeway.</p>
<p>Cultiwate will also be
the ‘IMDb of New Talents’ with a ‘New powerhouse of talents’ and will provide a
comprehensive database for other filmmakers and producers to collaborate/ hire talents from our platform. It is a free service for filmmakers with a
minimum of 1 approved upload in our platform and a paid service for ‘Others’
with a monthly/ annual subscription. </p>
<p>Cultiwate as an
incubator works along with the audiences. The films curated by the curators are available for public voting (viewing &amp; curating) and the audiences help us in narrowing the choice
of top 12 films of the year based on top films of each month. </p>
<p>In May 2015,
Cultiwate will launch its platform for ‘Film makers’ and ‘Ad Makers’ and the Public Version after initial curation will launch in November 2015. </p>
<p><i><b>In short, Cultiwate’s
grand vision is to become a leader in sourcing talent through 'quality content' and thus becoming a
talent powerhouse. </b></i></p>

<p><b>Film Incubator
Platform</b> is the first film incubator platform
where the short filmmakers are nurtured, groomed and promoted by the industry
veterans. Like Incubators accepts a Pitch/ Business Plan in the case of
Startups, to enter our platform, Filmmakers upload short/ Ad films to our platform that are curated by critics,
producers, agents and executives. Approved films are showcased to the public on
Cultiwate’s Filmmaker’s Platform and the films that are passed on by the
curators will be uploaded into Cultiwate’s YouTube Channel, where 5 films based
on maximum likes each month will go directly to the Cultiwate platform where
they will compete with other curated films in the platform.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Top 10 Films of the month on ‘Cultiwate.com’ will be picked from
‘Public Votes’ based on Ratings. These filmmakers will also be given an
opportunity to present a ‘feature film’ or a ‘TV Pilot’ screenplay of their
respective short films – if we like the Screenplay; we will finance/ produce
the content. We will also be promoting these screenplays (and the talents)
through our Talent and Literary Agents and will be pitching in their screenplay
to other producers/ studio executives in the industry. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The Top filmmaker of the month will also be given an opportunity to
direct another short film fully financed and produced by Makuta Films. At the
end of the year the 12 short filmmakers get together for a ‘Talent Campus’ like
the famous ‘Berlin Talent Campus’ – a week long mentoring session with industry
veterans, and at the end – The best 3 of the 12 short films will be awarded
Medals and a potential chance to direct a feature film.</p>

Cultiwate™ is an incubator for aspiring talents in the entertainment industry. It is a digital content curation ecosystem that will help short filmmakers, VR content creators and Ad makers with rich, diverse and quality content to get the right exposure and maximize revenue streams. Cultiwate's main goal is to help filmmakers transition to the big screen through mentorships, internships and incubation. 



Cultiwate™ is also the first exclusive curation and incubation hub for producing and distributing Short form Virtual Reality (VR) content -  Movies, Theme Park Rides, Games.


Our team is a perfect mix of key executives from Hollywood and Silicon Valley, Youth and Seniority, with multiple years of experience of having worked in major Film/ TV studios and at Fortune 500 companies.  Makuta Inc. is one of our integral partners in this exciting endeavor.   




Cultiwate™ has been selected as an emerging ‪#‎startup at this year's NAB Show and will be featured at the
Startup Loft from April 11 to April 16, 2015. We will be announcing Cultiwate
at this event.Come
visit us at Booth ‪#‎N6839. For complimentary passes, Stay Tuned! 




Our Vision
Cultiwate’s vision is to become a one-stop shop for talented
filmmakers using our powerful digital content curation ecosystem that will help
filmmakers with rich, diverse and quality content to get the right exposure and
maximize revenue streams. And, also help filmmaker's transition to the big
screen through mentorships, internships and incubation.
Cultiwate will provide
a reliable platform for all talents in the Film Business to showcase their skills
that will pave way for providing them the much-needed break in the mainstream
business thereby realizing our vision to be a powerful curation ecosystem.
Cultiwate will be the first ever curation cum incubation hub for Virtual Reality (VR) Content. We will be distributing VR content through our Cultiwate VR platform accessible via a plethora of VR headsets. We curate the best of the VR content submitted by filmmakers and monetize it on behalf of filmmakers. Apart from curating, Cultiwate will also develop and produce exclusive content in the VR space with the filmmakers from our network. 
While giving the filmmakers the well-deserved exposure, Cultiwate also helps them monetize their short
films through multiple streams of distribution platforms ranging from
our own in-house Cultiwate Ad-based Streaming, theatrical screenings, In-Flight
and Cruise Entertainment to leading new media distributors like Amazon Instant,
Hulu, Netflix and YouTube, thereby helping them recoup their existing
investments. And, in this process, Cultiwate will charge a flat 30%
distribution fee for facilitating and negotiating the deals. 
Cultiwate will also
provide affordable services for filmmakers ranging from Subtitling, Dubbing,
Building Apps & Website, Drafting and Filing Copyright, Editing a unique trailer, Designing Titles and Poster for
their short films in the platform, thus Cultiwate will be an exclusive 'Fiverr' for the Film Industry.  Later on we intend to bring in VFX
services to the platform. 
Cultiwate will provide
a submission platform to various film festivals worldwide
with a 1-click submission process from within the website at highly discounted
prices or for free. We have struck deals with various film festivals (and in
the process of adding more). The pricing (if discounted) on Cultiwate is exclusive and we do not charge filmmakers for online screeners hosting
unlike competitors like Withoutabox (Amazon) and Film Freeway.
Cultiwate will also be
the ‘IMDb of New Talents’ with a ‘New powerhouse of talents’ and will provide a
comprehensive database for other filmmakers and producers to collaborate/ hire talents from our platform. It is a free service for filmmakers with a
minimum of 1 approved upload in our platform and a paid service for ‘Others’
with a monthly/ annual subscription. 
Cultiwate as an
incubator works along with the audiences. The films curated by the curators are available for public voting (viewing & curating) and the audiences help us in narrowing the choice
of top 12 films of the year based on top films of each month. 
In May 2015,
Cultiwate will launch its platform for ‘Film makers’ and ‘Ad Makers’ and the Public Version after initial curation will launch in November 2015. 
In short, Cultiwate’s
grand vision is to become a leader in sourcing talent through 'quality content' and thus becoming a
talent powerhouse.

Film Incubator
Platform is the first film incubator platform
where the short filmmakers are nurtured, groomed and promoted by the industry
veterans. Like Incubators accepts a Pitch/ Business Plan in the case of
Startups, to enter our platform, Filmmakers upload short/ Ad films to our platform that are curated by critics,
producers, agents and executives. Approved films are showcased to the public on
Cultiwate’s Filmmaker’s Platform and the films that are passed on by the
curators will be uploaded into Cultiwate’s YouTube Channel, where 5 films based
on maximum likes each month will go directly to the Cultiwate platform where
they will compete with other curated films in the platform.

The Top 10 Films of the month on ‘Cultiwate.com’ will be picked from
‘Public Votes’ based on Ratings. These filmmakers will also be given an
opportunity to present a ‘feature film’ or a ‘TV Pilot’ screenplay of their
respective short films – if we like the Screenplay; we will finance/ produce
the content. We will also be promoting these screenplays (and the talents)
through our Talent and Literary Agents and will be pitching in their screenplay
to other producers/ studio executives in the industry. 

The Top filmmaker of the month will also be given an opportunity to
direct another short film fully financed and produced by Makuta Films. At the
end of the year the 12 short filmmakers get together for a ‘Talent Campus’ like
the famous ‘Berlin Talent Campus’ – a week long mentoring session with industry
veterans, and at the end – The best 3 of the 12 short films will be awarded
Medals and a potential chance to direct a feature film.

They that can be produced independently. They can reach the market very soon and require significantly lesser industrial means than a full cabinet would. The advantage is that existing kitchens can be easily equipped to eliminate intoxication or cutting risk. All parents deserve to get rid of that type of worries. The sale of kits will provide the capital to finally produce the complete system with both protections.</span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>WHY WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT</h3>
<p><b>Why We Need Your Support: </b>We need your support because the industrial production needs important financing to reach the highest quality standards. Also thousands of people believe that the Kid Secure Home solution is useful and can truly help reduce household risks for their children. That is why it has been awarded a gold medal at the <i>Concours l’Epine</i> (Paris, France) in 2010 and bronze medal at the <i>International Exhibition of Inventions</i> (Geneva, Switzerland) in 2011. The solution was so successful on the television show <i><a href=""http://www.telleestmatele.com/article-video-l-inventeur-2012-04-juin-2012-sur-m6-la-famille-chedozeau-fait-un-carton-106504552.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Inventor of 2012</a></i> that it was shortlisted in the 9 best inventions eligible for the finals over a pool of 650 candidates.</p>

<h3>PROTOTYPES</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><b></b>
</p>
<p><b>Prototypes: </b>Currently we only have one fully working prototype for the complete solution and another one for the drawer kit. They are made in metal. The current photos and videos are all shot with these. Our vision is to bring our safety solutions at an affordable price to families without compromising with quality. Our task is to refine our concept the closest to the technical ideal for a final production in plastic and with the most universal form factor. We are doing our best to achieve that goal have developed ingenious concepts that we need to test.</p>

<h3>DEVELOPMENT TIME</h3>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<p><b>Development time: </b>A significant step to start mass production is the creation of an industrial moulding set. It allows producing the plastic kits by injection. We want a universal form factor and it will take up to six months to reach the industrial production stage. Perfection is time-consuming, but so worth it.</p>

The Kid Secure Home concept is an innovative and smart solution that ensures safety for children in the kitchen and peace of mind for parents.
« Children safety for a happy family  For a safer home »





One concept, two safety elements:


a stove protection to prevent from burns


a drawer safety system to ensure toxic products and dangerous objects are out of reach




« In France only, 2’000 children under 6 years old are victims of household accidents daily. It is roughly 740’000 ending up in the hospital emergency services yearly. And 1'700’000 up to 15 years old.
The household is the first place of risk for children under age 4, where over 80% of the accidents occurINVS, Epac 2002 – 2003. 


« Every child injury means two parents in worry »




THE KID SECURE HOME SOLUTION

The Kid Secure Home Solution: it is a fully integrated, secure and clean system that truly protects children against risks of accidents in the kitchen
Protection against multiple risks: burns, cuts, poisoning



Integrated: fits any original design


Clean: protects against dust, spills, …


Minimal cost, maximum protection 





FINANCING THE DRAWER SAFETY KIT

Drawer Safety Kit:  We chose to begin by producing drawer safety kits. They that can be produced independently. They can reach the market very soon and require significantly lesser industrial means than a full cabinet would. The advantage is that existing kitchens can be easily equipped to eliminate intoxication or cutting risk. All parents deserve to get rid of that type of worries. The sale of kits will provide the capital to finally produce the complete system with both protections.


WHY WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT
Why We Need Your Support: We need your support because the industrial production needs important financing to reach the highest quality standards. Also thousands of people believe that the Kid Secure Home solution is useful and can truly help reduce household risks for their children. That is why it has been awarded a gold medal at the Concours l’Epine (Paris, France) in 2010 and bronze medal at the International Exhibition of Inventions (Geneva, Switzerland) in 2011. The solution was so successful on the television show The Inventor of 2012 that it was shortlisted in the 9 best inventions eligible for the finals over a pool of 650 candidates.



PROTOTYPES
 


Prototypes: Currently we only have one fully working prototype for the complete solution and another one for the drawer kit. They are made in metal. The current photos and videos are all shot with these. Our vision is to bring our safety solutions at an affordable price to families without compromising with quality. Our task is to refine our concept the closest to the technical ideal for a final production in plastic and with the most universal form factor. We are doing our best to achieve that goal have developed ingenious concepts that we need to test.



PROJECT TIMELINE





May-June-July = Final design and plastic prototype tests (3D prints)


August-September = Production of industrial moulding sets


October-November = Assembly and packing


December = Shipping




HOW WILL THE FUNDS BE USED

How will the funds be used



100’000 = Moulding and other manufacturing set-up


25’000 = Final design and prototypes


10’000 = Assembly and other manufacturing costs


30’000 = Production and packaging of ready to ship modules


5’000 = Incorporation and other costs




DEVELOPMENT TIME

Development time: A significant step to start mass production is the creation of an industrial moulding set. It allows producing the plastic kits by injection. We want a universal form factor and it will take up to six months to reach the industrial production stage. Perfection is time-consuming, but so worth it.

LE CONCEPT


Le concept: La solution Kid Secure Home a pour but d’apporter la sécurité pour les enfants et la tranquillité pour les parents avec un système de sécurité dans la cuisine innovant et malin.
« La sécurité pour les enfants, la tranquillité pour les parents »





Nous avons un concept : un meuble intégrant deux éléments de sécurité :


la sécurité au niveau des plaques de cuisson pour éliminer les risques de brûlure


la protection des tiroirs pour éloigner les produits toxiques et les objets dangereux des enfants




« Chaque jour en France, 2 000 enfants de 0 à 6 ans sont victimes d’accidents de la vie courante. Sur une année, on estime à près de 740 000 le nombre d’accidents de la vie courante dans cette tranche d’âge (1 700 000 parmi les enfants de 0 à 15 ans) qui entraînent une consultation aux urgences hospitalières.
Pour les jeunes enfants entre 0 et 4 ans, l’intérieur de la maison (accident domestique) représente le principal lieu d’accident (plus de 80 %). »INVS, Epac 2002 – 2003. 


« Car un enfant accidenté c’est aussi deux parents mobilisés »




LA SOLUTION KID SECURE HOME

La solution Kid Secure Home: Kid Secure Home est un système de sécurité entièrement intégré, efficace et hygiénique qui protège l’enfant des risques d’accident ménager dans les cuisines.



Protection multirisques: brûlures, coupures, intoxications.


Intégré: respecte le design original


Hygiénique: anti-poussière, …


Coût minimal, protection maximale

Unser Konzept: Ein Möbelstück mit zwei integrierten Sicherheitselementen:



einem Herdplattenschutz, um Verbrennungen zu vermeiden


einem Sicherheitssystem für Schubladen, um giftige Substanzen und gefährliche Gegenstände von Kindern fernzuhalten


""Jeden Tag werden in Frankreich 2 000 Kinder zwischen 0 und 6 Jahren Opfer von Unfällen im Alltag. Umgerechnet auf ein Jahr, geht man von ungefähr 740 000 Alltagsunfällen in dieser Altersstufe aus (1 7000 000 bei Kindern zwischen 0 und 15 Jahren), die einen Besuch der Notaufnahme zur Folge haben. 
Kleinkinder zwischen 0 und 4 Jahren werden hauptsächlich in Ihrem eigenen Zuhause (mehr als 80 %) Opfer von Unfällen (Haushaltsunfälle).INVS, Epac 2002 – 2003.



DAS KID SECURE HOME SYSTEM

Das Kid Secure Home-System: Kid Secure Home ist ein effizientes, hygienisches und vollkommen integriertes Sicherheitssystem, das Ihr Kind vor Haushaltsunfällen in der Küche schützt.



Umfangreicher Schutz: Verbrennungen, Schnittverletzungen, Vergiftungen


Integriert: kann an jedes Design angepasst werden


Hygienisch: staubabweisend


Minimale Kosten, maximaler Schutz




FINANZIERUNG DES SCHUBLADEN-SICHERHEITSSYSTEMS

Das Schubladen-Sicherheitssystem: Wir haben beschlossen, als Erstes dasSicherheitssystem für Schubladen zu produzieren. Hierbei handelt es sich um ein Element, das unabhängig und mit geringem Zeitaufwand produziert werden kann und für dessen Herstellung viel weniger industrielle Infrastruktur nötig ist, als für ein komplettes Möbelstück. Der Vorteil ist, dass es sehr leicht in bereits bestehende Küchen eingebaut werden kann, um das Risiko von Vergiftungen und Schnittverletzungen auszuschalten. Für die Eltern bedeutet dies eine Sorge weniger. Mit dem Kapital aus dem Verkauf dieses Systems können wir schliesslich Möbelstücke produzieren, die alle Sicherheitselemente enthalten.


WIR BRAUCHEN IHRE UNTER-STUETZUNG

Warum wir Ihre Unterstützung brauchen:Wir brauchen Ihre Unterstützung, weil die industrielle Produktion des Systems sehr kostspielig ist, wenn wir den höchsten Qualitätsstandards gerecht werden wollen. Tausende von Menschen sind überzeugt, dass Kid Secure Home eine sinnvolle Lösung ist, mit der die Risiken von Haushaltsunfällen deutlich reduziert werden können. Deshalb gewannen wir mit dem System den Wettbewerb Concours Lépine 2010(Paris, Frankreich) sowie eine Medaille bei der Messe für Erfindungen Salon International de l’Invention (Genf, Schweiz). 2012 wurde das Möbelstück mit den 2 Sicherheitselementen mit grossem Erfolg in der Fernsehsendung L’Inventeur 2012 vorgestellt und aus 650 Beiträgen unter die 9 besten Erfindungen ins Finale gewählt.

PROTOTYPEN

Prototypen: Wir haben gegenwärtig einen Prototyp für daskomplette Möbelstück und einen für das Schubladen-System. Sie sind aus Metall gefertigt. Diese Prototypen dienten als Modelle für die Fotos und Videos, um die praktische Umsetzung des Systems zu veranschaulichen. Unser Ziel ist es, Familien erschwingliche Sicherheitslösungen anzubieten, ohne bei der Qualität Kompromisse eingehen zu müssen. Unsere gegenwärtige Aufgabe besteht darin, das Konzept zu verfeinern, um die Elemente schliesslich aus qualitativ hochwertigem Plastik und so universell wie möglich produzieren zu können. Wir tun unser Bestes, um dieses Ziel zu erreichen und haben bereits clevereKonzepte entwickelt, die es nun zu testen gilt.

Go Kidogo!
Hi! We are Sachi, Marleen, Francesco, Jing and Victoria, an extremely international bunch of students from Cass Business School in London just looking to make a difference. Growing up all over the world we all still have the same goal in mind- to Improve access to early childhood care in informal settlements for families that have not had the same opportunities as us. Thats why we are on this journey to support social enterprise Kidogo!





Kidogo is a start up in the informal settlements of Nairobi, Kenya that ultimately designs & operates a network of early childhood development centres that provide young children a safe and stimulating environment, nutritious meals, a play based curriculum and well- trained caregivers from the local community. Local budding 'mama-prenuers' are also given the opportunity to open up their own micro franchised childcare business, by getting assistance with training, materials and the logistics. Which is what WE will be funding.



What exactly is a 'Mama-preneur' you may be thinking? It is very tough to be a child care entrepeneur, you need to have the right skills between being a great mother and a great entrepreneur- hence a 'mama-preneuer!'



By joining us on our delightful journey to fund Kidogo, YOU could be a part of something much bigger than just funding.The financial sustainability and scalability of their model has great potential to be rolled out in informal settlements worldwide. By improving the quality of facilities we hope to transform the trajectory of young children's lives whilst, unlocking their mothers economic potential and empowering 'mama-preneurs' to build strong and thriving businesses. 





Training session on the importance of play for early learning using local materials 

   The Kidogo Need

We will be funding the rolling out of the micro-franchise programmes to 'mama-preneurs' in Nairobi who will be given the opportunity to create their own child-care business-in-a-box.





The franchising program will have 2 main tiers:



Outreach program for smaller baby care centres- which includes in-center training, light touch mentoring and a rotational ""learning-box."" This will contain age appropriate lesson plans, activity cards, learning materials and books for the centre

Accelerator program for growing education development centres- 'Mama-preneurs' from these centres will be taken through a 6-12 month intensive program where they will be provided with in-depth mentorship and training and the 'Business-in-a-box' which provides access to additional resources.


The costs will be broken down as follows:




Training session- Hosting 5-10 'mama-preneurs' for training session (£50-80)

'Learning-box'- developing, sourcing and rotating a learning box (£100)

1 year Mentorship program- for 5-10 centres (£120-240)

'Business-in-a-box'- developing sourcing and providing materials to 'mama-preneurs' (£250)


What does a business-in-a-box contain?





Perks- What you get from us


Because you are giving so much to us, we wanted to give back a little something to you! Here's what you get if you contribute-





The Kidogo Impact





Every contribution you make will go towards funding Kidogo's dream of a world where every child has an opportunity to reach their full potential, regardless of where they were born.

In many urban slums today, enterprising mama's open up their homes to care for children for a small fee, up to $1 USD per day. The quality of these informal baby care centres is often very poor- with 30-40 babies in a small enclosed space, unsafe & unsanitary environment, limited food & clean water and untrained caregivers. In this case, children's health, wellbeing and growth can be compromised leading to developmental delays.



With Kidogo's help local baby cares will provide:



A safe environment
Caregivers they can trust
An affordable and quality curriculum 


The day to day life of a Kidogo kid


Who will benefit?





Young Children- between the ages of 0-5, children are most sensitive to their environments. Using Kidogo's model their healthy growth and development can improve the trajectory of the rest of their lives.

Mothers- mothers of young children that were faced with the problem of where to leave children when going to work can now leave them in a safe trustworthy space, unlocking their economic potential.

'Mama-preneurs'- local women will have the opportunity to open up their own quality childcare franchise and training to create an economically sustainable business.


We hope that the success of this project could lead to rolling out the model throughout informal settlements in Kenya and all over the world. The creation of small micro franchised day cares will teach 'mama-preneurs' to be self sustainable, whilst fuelling the local economy. Additionally, children will be given the foundation to work towards eradicating the intergenerational cycle of poverty.

<br/><p>Unless you have the next Pebble Watch for market (as of this posting, they have raised $14.8 Million and have 23 days left to go), most retail buyers are not going to take a look at your product unless you have a solid plan in distribution and marketing. <b>We want to make selling to retailers easier for small entrepreneurs</b>!<br/></p>
<p>We want to build a platform (aka virtual
incubator) where retail-oriented gadget entrepreneurs have a place to learn and
develop the necessary strategies in making their dream a reality.</p>
<p>From producing online “how-to” videos where these
entrepreneurs can access 24/7 to match-making them with retail and/or
distributor opportunities, we want to be the “one-stop” platform for
crowd-funded gadget entrepreneurs in reaching retail excellence!</p>
<p>With your help, we really hope we can make a difference
for the thousands of product manufacturers, entrepreneurs, and inventors who
want to learn how to sell and market effectively to retailers. </p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>A Startling Fact<br/>
</h3> <p>1 out of every 50 crowd-funded gadget entrepreneurs get their product picked up by  a major retailer.  That's where we want to help. Last year, we interviewed over 500 crowd-funded gadget entrepreneurs and over 90% did not know how to sell to retail buyers, let alone how to contact or reach them.</p>
<p>For the lucky few who were able to get their product picked up by key retailers and distributors, some of them did not see a huge increase in orders due to not knowing what questions to ask in the meetings with retail buyers or what terms and conditions were negotiable prior to signing the retailer's vendor agreement.  <br/></p>

Selling to Retailers is hard!


Unless you have the next Pebble Watch for market (as of this posting, they have raised $14.8 Million and have 23 days left to go), most retail buyers are not going to take a look at your product unless you have a solid plan in distribution and marketing. We want to make selling to retailers easier for small entrepreneurs!
We want to build a platform (aka virtual
incubator) where retail-oriented gadget entrepreneurs have a place to learn and
develop the necessary strategies in making their dream a reality.
From producing online “how-to” videos where these
entrepreneurs can access 24/7 to match-making them with retail and/or
distributor opportunities, we want to be the “one-stop” platform for
crowd-funded gadget entrepreneurs in reaching retail excellence!
With your help, we really hope we can make a difference
for the thousands of product manufacturers, entrepreneurs, and inventors who
want to learn how to sell and market effectively to retailers. 
   A Startling Fact
 1 out of every 50 crowd-funded gadget entrepreneurs get their product picked up by  a major retailer.  That's where we want to help. Last year, we interviewed over 500 crowd-funded gadget entrepreneurs and over 90% did not know how to sell to retail buyers, let alone how to contact or reach them.
For the lucky few who were able to get their product picked up by key retailers and distributors, some of them did not see a huge increase in orders due to not knowing what questions to ask in the meetings with retail buyers or what terms and conditions were negotiable prior to signing the retailer's vendor agreement.  





   Why You Should Invest In Us
  
Since 2008, we have helped over 2500 small entrepreneurs learn how to sell retailers. Many of them today are still selling in retail stores. One of them made INC Magazine's list of the fastest 500 growing companies two years in a row!
What makes us different than other companies?
We have been on both sides of the retail buyer's desk. We have been in the shoes of a small manufacturer selling consumer products to retailers as well as have been large retail buyers managing assortments ranging in the millions. This experience within the retail industry sets us apart as a
leading retail marketing and merchandising solutions provider.  
We feel it's our responsibility to share our secrets in successful selling to retailers with all the small crowd-funded gadget entrepreneurs.  We know that most small entrepreneurs can't afford high quality advice.  With this platform, it will be in reach for all entrepreneurs and puts everyone on the same level playing field. 

And it's up to you - We need your help
If we want you to get the REAL impact of our retail selling platform, then we must demonstrate and prove that it works - in the real world, with a real project.
That's why we chose to co-create this retail platform together with you, as an IndieGoGo campaigner.
When you contribute to this IndieGoGo campaign you become our partner. You get to provide valuable input in how the retail platform should be put together. 
When this IndieGoGo 
campaign reaches its goal, then we will pick up to five random crowd-funded gadget entrepreneurs and put them through the platform.  

Final words


Unique products are the ones that drive customer traffic into a retailer's store:

They are the ones that are responsible to most innovation in the world
They are the ones that are responsible to most new jobs in the world
They are the blood and oxygen of our economy.

<h3>How we source our products</h3>
<div>Sourcing is our sweet spot. It is where we truly excel. My background is in purchasing, interning at Filene's department store during my junior year of college. After graduation the following spring, I entered into the Assistant Buyer program, slowly learning the retail trade and honing my skills as a merchant. I didn't know it at the time, but my retail experience, background and contacts would serve me well in crafting and creating One-Flag.</div>

<div>Sourcing American Made Goods requires a whole different level of effort, expertise and skill. I am often on the road traveling to trade shows, factories and vendors to ensure we live up to our lofty goal of bringing the Best of What's Made in America to you. </div>

<p>Unfortunately, we cannot attend every Trade Show in New York or LA markets.  This country we call home is incredibly large and full of great American craftsman, makers and designers. So if we are going to truly strive to bring the Best of What's Made in America to One-Flag, we need to elicit some help -- from you. So we created One-Flag to be a Social Commerce Company.  </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges:</h3>
<p>There are risks and challenges with every new small business one of the most prominent is funding and awareness. That is why we are using Indiegogo as our crowd funding resource. By creating this campaign we are looking to mitigate both risks by helping to raise the funds and awareness necessary to ensure we make an impact and provide a valuable resource to consumers everywhere. There are additional risks associated with creating a brand and business focused on American Made products. Specifically, changing the consumers' thought processes when shopping for the products they want or need. Currently 54% of consumers do not make a special effort to buy products made in the U.S.</p>

<h3>Exclusively American, Exclusively for You!</h3>

</div></div>","Our Mission:
""Is to make shopping for American Made products easy, while enriching the American consumer experience.""
Allow us to introduce ourselves.
We are an American company selling American Made goods specializing in Clothing, Accessories & Goods for Men & Women. To put it another way, We are an American lifestyle company tailored for the American Lifestyle. That's it, nothing more and certainly nothing less. 
Launched in 2014, the company was conceived after my wife and I took the Made in America Challenge. Frustrated with the effort it took to find the Made in USA products, yet, amazed by the depth, breadth and quality of the American Made goods available in the market, it was clear. There simply needed to be a better resource for the craftsmen, designers & makers of the American Made products to showcase their unique skills & talents in one easy to shop location. With the seed planted, One-Flag was born.



A Different Retail Model

What sets us apart and makes us different from every other Retail Store?


What we sell
Why we sell these products
How we source our products
How we classify the products we sell

What we Sell:
Everything we sell is Proudly Made in the USA.
We specialize in Products for Women & Men with a wide assortment of Accessories & specially curated Goods. To see our full assortment, visit our website at www.one-flag.com.



















Our assortment is constantly growing & expanding; however, because we're a start-up e-commerce business, some of the larger makers and manufacturers were wary to offer their products for sale on our site. They liked what we were doing and told us that if we ever open a brick & mortar store they would be there to support us. Our first priority will be to support the brands and makers that have helped us get to where we are; however, in our to desire to bring a proper & full assortment to our customers, we will be offering even more All-American awesome when we open our flagship store this May.

Perks:






Why we sell these products:

We believe in American manufacturing
We believe in a balanced economy of Production & Consumption
We believe in Quality over Quantity
We want to know where the products we are buying come from 
We want to know the companies and brands that make those products


So now that we have given you some insight into who we are, let's look at where we stand regarding American manufacturing, specifically - apparel & garment manufacturing. 

or another way of looking at this Graph.
More then 850,000 Americans have lost their jobs in apparel manufacturing since 1990.

If we, as Americans, want to have a strong, sustainable, and growing economy, we need to have a strong manufacturing base to support and fuel that growth. Buying American Made products will provide that long-term positive impact in our micro and macro economies.

Your funds will be helping Small Businesses across the country. Your funds will also be helping American Manufacturers, Craftsmen, Designers & Makers. Lastly, your funds will be helping us! 
I believe enough in the need to provide American Made products to you that I have already invested nearly all of my savings into building this company: from typical business start-up costs to website design, hosting & operational activities. I am fully invested into this business, and your support will help push me over the financing hump.
Any funds raised in excess of our goal of $50,000 will go directly towards additional retail inventory & fulfilling our perks. We will be able to expand our product assortments and offerings to you! 

What people are saying about One-Flag:
""...quite honestly, you have the most tasteful and attractive Made in America apparel site I’ve seen, hands down. Way to go! "" Courtenay, Managing Director at Krammer & Stoudt

""First off, Love the site. Very well put together. There’s a million sites out there today and curating can be difficult. ""  Ben, Founder & Owner of WoodChuckUSA

""...Your shop looks amazing! I will definitely be adding it to our list of featured shops! I'd love to offer you some advice but I think your shop is perfectly setup."" Brad, Founder & Owner Out of the Sandbox


Risks & Challenges:
There are risks and challenges with every new small business one of the most prominent is funding and awareness. That is why we are using Indiegogo as our crowd funding resource. By creating this campaign we are looking to mitigate both risks by helping to raise the funds and awareness necessary to ensure we make an impact and provide a valuable resource to consumers everywhere. There are additional risks associated with creating a brand and business focused on American Made products. Specifically, changing the consumers' thought processes when shopping for the products they want or need. Currently 54% of consumers do not make a special effort to buy products made in the U.S.

We are ready to take these challenges head on, and your contributions will help us in overcoming these risks. By offering a great assortment for Men & Women including Accessories and Goods carefully curated to offer new, unique and quality crafted products in an easy to shop resource, we will begin to shift the tide back towards a more balanced economy of domestic Production and Consumption. Would you want to bet against America? 





We Feel the time is right. Right Now.

    We hope you can contribute to our crowd-funding campaign and help us to create an American Lifestyle store, worthy of your contribution. If you do not have the financial resources to donate, we understand, as we are asking for money ourselves. But you can still help us out in a very big way by sharing our Indiegogo campaign with your all of your friends, family members, neighbors & co-workers.
Word of Mouth is still the best advertising and your help, support & sharing will go a long way in helping us reach our goal. Thank You for your support of One-Flag!

<p>Essentially, we
are vigorous gamers and equally an active member of pop culture. Additionally,
we have always been intrigued by the atmosphere of a karaoke bar and a
convention center. Particularly for its competitive ambience and in which you
can meet challengers or allies  at every
corner.  In essence, we thought it would
be interesting to combine the fundamentals of video games, pop culture and net
café/ bar to essentially form the idea of <i>The Grid</i>.  As we have immersed ourselves into the video
game culture and mainstream pop culture, we found that although there are
conventions and social gatherings that cater to those in these groups, many
events prohibit consumption of alcohol. 
Thus the idea of <i>The Grid</i> blends all these social aspect into one social
hub, where individuals may come in for a fun night in an atmosphere of gaming,
pop culture and social drinking. As The Grid expands its ideals and values, we
welcome those of other artistic talents to come in and display their projects,
essentially to help independent artists to gain recognition and publicity that
they have been investing their time in achieving their goals just as we have.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1190252/files/20150202073852-floorplan.jpg?1422891532"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p> <i>The Grid</i> consists of a dedicated floor space
to LAN players and console gamers, a lounge section a bar under an umbrella of
video game culture. It is a convenient place in which students can come to
study, individuals can recline and drink or just play games. The idea of being
surrounded by people whom share the same interests and passions that you hold
dearly all under one amicable roof has been a longing for many. <i>The Grid</i>
services to the gamers and encourage competitive gaming.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1194585/files/20150203165330-view_3.jpg?1423011210"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p> As a contributor, you help us create a place
where gamers, geeks and nerds can be more than just a title. It can be a
coveited status and when you step through our door you are not just another

be contributed to equipment and renovation. The equipment would consist of TVs,
accessories, consoles, furniture’s and bars related items. As for renovations,
we plan to have a <i>Tron</i> inspired theme just for creative foundation. So there is
going to be quite a bit of back lighting. We have two monitors dedicated to
twitter and Instagram. We will also have a photo booth which directly post
pictures on our Instagram feed. Buying a number of pints will get you free game
time. Operational hours for all ages gaming from 10am-8pm. The bar becomes a
mature gaming atmosphere that starts from 8pm-3am. If we do not make our entire
goal we will use what funds we do have to launch weekly, if not monthly
tournaments and fantasy football league matches until we make enough to open
<i>The Grid</i>. Every few months we plan to have a screening of films made by indie
directors and producers.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1194587/files/20150203165405-view_2.jpg?1423011245"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p> As a

ideas imposed onto a group of people whom are passionate about their hobbies. A

further developing the community. An environment of understanding and friendly
rivalries.</p>
<p> The
thing that makes us different from other bars and lounges is that we try to
cater mostly to gamers and the encompassing world. This is one of our
challenges. I admit from a certain point of view it does look like we are
trying to have a specific piece of the pie. Honestly, I feel that <i>The Grid</i> will make anyone into a gamer.
If anything, it will open new interests for many who step through our doors.
Another challenge is location. We can have everything a gamer needs but if he
cannot find us what is the point. We are aiming for a location near public
transportation and somewhere near a college or university. A place with an
abundant amount of foot traffic.</p><p><i>The Grid</i> is built on a foundation of detailed planning which intertwines the various concepts and ideas influenced by the gaming and pop culture world.

<p><b>Business Background</b></p>
<p>Martin Hall spent a year in business school
studying how to start a business. He was a business consultant for Syncup
technologies Inc. He helped a friend found an IT company. We have been working
on and refining this dream for four years.We  decided to open a console
based arcade with all the good stuff of a bar, lounge and net café. To promote
socializing between gamers and the outside world.</p>
<p><u><b>Business Vision</b></u></p>
<p> <i>The
Grid</i> is the next step for social gatherings. A place for official tournaments
and unofficial bouts. Primarily for fun, but business is never too far behind.
Students of all kinds can come and either study using our free wi-fi and
computers, or relax with the wide selection of games, movies and other
entertainment means. We offer a social, interactive, open, safe and sometimes
very competitive gaming experiences. Where people come to play consoles in an
arcade type environment while taking a moment to drink and discuss pop culture
during a paused game. Build a profitable and respected business recognized
nationwide that will crush all gamer stereotypes.</p>
<p> After
8pm the bar and lounge opens. At this time customers can enjoy varieties of
beer and liquor while taking advantage of our social media integration. Where
most bars kick you out for drinking too much or completing questionable feats, <i>The Grid</i> rewards you with a shirt and/or
pin from our achievements project. Eventually we will add a karaoke room and
another room for games like guitar hero and just dance.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1194590/files/20150203165513-view_1.jpg?1423011313"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>

<p>Our primary targets are Gamers,
specifically social and leisure gamers. These are the gamers that prefer to
play games with groups of people and have an abundant amount of free time. They
are more likely to return over and over with more customers every time. But
they currently stay home and add on to gamer stereotypes or go to outdated
arcades, bars and limited pc lounges. These customers will choose <i>The Grid</i> because the idea promotes
socialization and “owning”. It reaches from the talkative and friendly gamers
to the most aggressive and bold gamer so there is always a challenge. Most will
come in person but you can reserve a time period online or by phone and the

Team, <i>The Grid</i></p><p><i>Martin Hall, Jonathan D. Griffith, Pirassanth Sellasamey</i></p></div>","Summary
Essentially, we
are vigorous gamers and equally an active member of pop culture. Additionally,
we have always been intrigued by the atmosphere of a karaoke bar and a
convention center. Particularly for its competitive ambience and in which you
can meet challengers or allies  at every
corner.  In essence, we thought it would
be interesting to combine the fundamentals of video games, pop culture and net
café/ bar to essentially form the idea of The Grid.  As we have immersed ourselves into the video
game culture and mainstream pop culture, we found that although there are
conventions and social gatherings that cater to those in these groups, many
events prohibit consumption of alcohol. 
Thus the idea of The Grid blends all these social aspect into one social
hub, where individuals may come in for a fun night in an atmosphere of gaming,
pop culture and social drinking. As The Grid expands its ideals and values, we
welcome those of other artistic talents to come in and display their projects,
essentially to help independent artists to gain recognition and publicity that
they have been investing their time in achieving their goals just as we have.
 The Grid consists of a dedicated floor space
to LAN players and console gamers, a lounge section a bar under an umbrella of
video game culture. It is a convenient place in which students can come to
study, individuals can recline and drink or just play games. The idea of being
surrounded by people whom share the same interests and passions that you hold
dearly all under one amicable roof has been a longing for many. The Grid
services to the gamers and encourage competitive gaming.
 As a contributor, you help us create a place
where gamers, geeks and nerds can be more than just a title. It can be a
coveited status and when you step through our door you are not just another
person. You become a key member of a community.
The funds will
be contributed to equipment and renovation. The equipment would consist of TVs,
accessories, consoles, furniture’s and bars related items. As for renovations,
we plan to have a Tron inspired theme just for creative foundation. So there is
going to be quite a bit of back lighting. We have two monitors dedicated to
twitter and Instagram. We will also have a photo booth which directly post

directors and producers.

My name is Freya and for several years I've been committed to buying cruelty-free products. What I've noticed is, it isn't easy! Even people that want to buy ethically often don't because labelling isn't clear, the products are more expensive or just difficult to find, especially on an emergency dash to the supermarket when you need something quick for dinner, or want to clean the bathroom when you forgot the in-laws are coming round. We realise that buying ethically is often more expensive, I'm a new mum and now I have even less money and time, but small changes to our shop can make a big impact without breaking the bank. That's where Kind comes in. We want to help you buy Kind!</p>
<p>We're building a website (the address will be <a href=""http://www.bekind.info"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.buykind.info</a>) full of product reviews, links to suppliers, profiles of high street supermarkets and shops so you can make ethical decisions when shopping, and also a list of local independent shops and suppliers. Alongside this, we'll offer information on like-minded organisations, news and issues surrounding green commerce, animal testing, fair trade, high welfare farming, etc. The website will cover fashion, food, beauty and household products at first, and will extend into services and transport too. Ultimately, we want to offer some of these products for sale, too, so you have a one-stop shop you can go to for everything you need and don't have to worry about whether it is green, animal-friendly, or fair trade, because if we offer it, it will be. We also want to help promote campaigns from other organisations and perhaps even get to the stage where we can run our own campaigns and lobby for changes that makes business of all kinds fairer and better for everyone.</p>
<p>Any funding we receive will help build our website content and launch a campaign to raise awareness of ethical consumerism. If you donate, you'll be helping to achieve more than launching a website and shop, you'll be helping people, animals and the environment all over the world. You'll make it easier for those already inclined to shop ethically, and you'll help us to inform others of the reasons why it is important to think about the impact our purchases have.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We want to get things started with an initial £8000. That will help us to get a slick, easy to navigate website (because we want to make it easy for consumers, right?) </p>
<p>It will also pay for great, experienced bloggers and writers to provide well-researched, honest and valuable content. We don't want to palm people off with terribly researched or badly written articles. There's a lot of ground to cover, and while we could ask writers to volunteer articles based upon a belief in our message, this route would inevitably take longer and produce less. Equally, we believe that it is only fair people are given something in return for the work they produce. We want people to leave our site better informed and having gained something, whether that is knowledge of where to buy bleach that doesn't test on animals, where to find a fantastic local coffee shop that's proudly fair trade and eco-friendly, or what the numbers printed on eggs mean in terms of welfare, or how green their favoured supermarket really is.</p>
<p>We will also use this money, initially, to buy products for review. We hope that ultimately manufacturers and suppliers will come to us, recognising the worth of having their products reviewed, but we need to start somewhere for this to happen.</p>
<p>We've taken the decision not to include perks, because we want to put the money into paying for great writing and a fantastic website. It was also restrictive in terms of fixing amounts that people were able to donate. However, we will have a page of thanks on our new website, letting others know that you've helped put a brick in the path to a better, fairer, kinder world of commerce.<br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>What we want is not only to be a place where Kind consumers, (those that are ethically minded), come for information and to shop, we want to change the face of business and commerce. We want to make it normal for people to care about where their food has travelled from, how the workers were treated on the farm or in the factory, how much they are paid, whether their product has been tested on animals, whether the animals they eat were reared in a natural, high welfare environment and how they were slaughtered. We want people to care about the impact their shopping choices have on the environment, whether the packaging is truly necessary, whether it is recyclable, how it is produced and how the growers / manufacturers / transportation companies / vendors (and all others associated with bringing a product to the consumer) ensure they operate as cleanly, greenly and ethically as possible. We don't want a Kind shopper to be in the minority, we want them to be the majority. Kindness over profit is only possible if the consumer says that is the way it has to be. Consumers will only put kindness over cost if they know why it's important and how they can do it. Please help us get there.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>We feel that compiling the information to help consumers shop kindly is going to be a long process, it is also something that will need continual updating. Stock changes quickly, companies change their policies, their suppliers and their ethics. We can't just write a company profile or place a link to a particular stockist to buy a product and leave it at that, we will need to be continually checking, re-evaluating and updating our content. That is, of course, a challenge, especially when (initially) we are working for free in our spare time. However, because we truly believe in this, we will ensure it is done. We also want to open honest channels of communication with companies that want to be featured or that want to improve their profile on our site and encourage them to keep us informed of changes in the way they operate.</p>
<p>When we begin to sell goods (which may be some way in the future), we will need to convince suppliers of our ability to sell their product. We envisage opening the Kind shop once we have built up a reputation and following, ensuring that the shop will automatically have a ready market in our audience.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you can't donate, but you like the sound of this venture, can you volunteer your time to help build our content? </p>
<p>Perhaps you're a web developer or a graphic designer, who could help make our website really great to use, or could give us a unique logo?</p>
<p> Are you a writer or blogger? If so, you could offer us product reviews, company profiles, news and current affairs (on campaigns and other ethical consumer issues), or you could write an opinion piece on having a meat free day a week, how to read packaging to ensure you're really buying high welfare food...etc, etc.  We're open to your ideas, and we want to hear from you!</p>
<p>Maybe you're a charitable organisation that wants to donate information / downloadable content for our site? If it's already written and you want to spread your information as far and wide as possible, we'll post it!</p>

business in the State of Oregon, with respect for the environment and the
beings who inhabit it at the forefront of all its products. All animal parts
used are sourced from roadkill, Fish and Wildlife auctions, are donated by
supporters, or are purchased from secondhand sources such as fellow artists,
auctions houses, estate sales, and antique stores. In this way, no animals are
killed solely for the sake of artworks produced. </p>
<p>The goal so far has been to create beautiful and functional
works of art from recycled and repurposed animal remains while maintaining a dedicated
respect to the environment as a whole. While in college, I studied environmentalism,
and have been actively involved with many different conservation groups around
the country - and even internationally, as well! <br/>
<br/>
The business started on Etsy while I was still in high school, and as support
has flourished, I have, too. Learning the arts of taxidermy, leatherworking, bone
carving, and hide tanning has allowed me to give “new life” to countless
wildlife specimens. My unique products and openness about the origins of all my
materials has garnered a lot of support over the years, and as a direct result
of that support – often from people just like you - I’ve been able to create a
career for myself based entirely on my arts. <br/>
<br/>
Now that summer is right around the corner, it’s time to start sending in my
applications to vend at various events throughout the Pacific Northwest. I will
be joined this season by a few very special guests, who plan to help me run my
booth and share in the festival spirit. <br/>
<br/>
Each festival has different vendor application and space rental procedures, but
generally speaking, for most large-scale events in the area, setting up a 10X10
booth runs between $250.00 - $500.00. Unfortunately, this winter has been a
tough one business-wise, and obtaining enough funding to secure these spaces
has been tough. However, summer vending is vital to the continued survival of
my business, and, by extension, my entire lifestyle as a self-employed artist. <br/>
<br/>
The goal of this fundraiser is to raise enough money so that my summer guests
and I can attend at least THREE large-scale festivals in the area. Any
additional funds raised will go directly toward production of new products and
wares, travel expenses, and possibly vending fees for even more great festivals
further away, if enough money is raised! <br/>
<br/>
Those who live in the Pacific Northwest are invited to stop by, chat, and spend
some time with NaturePunk and Co. if you attend any of the fairs we visit! I’ve
already sent in multiple applications to such events as Pacific Northwest Fire
Festival and Okanogan Barter Fair. I am currently pending approval for many of these festivals, but will only be accepted if I have the funds in hand at the time my application is reviewed and given the ""Okay!"" which is why this fundraiser so important. Every dollar counts in getting us just one step closer to our goal!<br/>

<p>Hi, I’m Karen Orlich, the founder of
k.o. kidz and creator of 'the POWCH’. </p>
<p>This idea started out simply.  I
wanted an easy, on-the-go container to feed my son healthy snacks.  I
thought giving him one of those disposal fruit and veggie pouches would be a
good idea.  But they’re expensive, hold very little food, and they’re
terrible for our environment.  Most of the packaging can’t even be
recycled and 2.5 BILLION single use pouches go into our landfills EVERY year.</p>
<p>So I decided to do something about it
and....  </p>
<p>it’s called the POWCH!</p>
<p>Working in my basement over several
months, I came up with a 12 oz pouch made of a soft, eco-friendly, waterproof
fabric with the same built in straw as the disposables.  I filled it with
applesauce or yogurt and my son loved it! </p>
<p>What I discovered was that I liked
using the POWCH too.  It was easy to use when commuting, after a work-out,
in the car, even hiking and biking.  So, it has become more than an option
for just my son, it’s an option for our entire family.</p>
<p>I’ve spent 2 years and my life
savings designing, developing, and testing this product with kids and
adults.  But I need your help to get this convenient, reusable product
into your family’s hands. </p>
<h3><b>Giving Back</b></h3>
<p>I also want to make this about more
than just selling products so I’ve taken it a step further and with every POWCH
that you purchase, I’ll donate to a children’s education or environmental
conservation charity.</p>
<h3><b>Request</b></h3>
<p>If you buy right now, I’ll be
one step closer to production.  The thing is...I need a minimum order of 2,500 to make it
possible.  </p><p>The $10,000 goal will cover a portion of the following:</p><p></p><p></p><ol>

<p>Stretch goal:  $20,000 </p><p>Let's work together to get there!!</p>
<h4><b>What Our Testers Are Saying…</b></h4>
<p><i>""The kids enjoy it.  Seals completely without
risk of leaking and it's easy to store and
clean.  My son didn't want to
give it back after testing!"" </i><b>- Mina F.</b></p>
<p><i>""Our daughter loves this type of product (squeeze pouches),
but you can't control what is in them (how much sugar, etc).  </i><em><i>I

</div></div>","Background
Hi, I’m Karen Orlich, the founder of
k.o. kidz and creator of 'the POWCH’. 
This idea started out simply.  I
wanted an easy, on-the-go container to feed my son healthy snacks.  I
thought giving him one of those disposal fruit and veggie pouches would be a
good idea.  But they’re expensive, hold very little food, and they’re
terrible for our environment.  Most of the packaging can’t even be
recycled and 2.5 BILLION single use pouches go into our landfills EVERY year.
So I decided to do something about it
and....  
it’s called the POWCH!
Working in my basement over several
months, I came up with a 12 oz pouch made of a soft, eco-friendly, waterproof
fabric with the same built in straw as the disposables.  I filled it with
applesauce or yogurt and my son loved it! 
What I discovered was that I liked
using the POWCH too.  It was easy to use when commuting, after a work-out,
in the car, even hiking and biking.  So, it has become more than an option
for just my son, it’s an option for our entire family.
I’ve spent 2 years and my life
savings designing, developing, and testing this product with kids and
adults.  But I need your help to get this convenient, reusable product
into your family’s hands. 
Giving Back
I also want to make this about more
than just selling products so I’ve taken it a step further and with every POWCH
that you purchase, I’ll donate to a children’s education or environmental
conservation charity.
Request
If you buy right now, I’ll be
one step closer to production.  The thing is...I need a minimum order of 2,500 to make it
possible.  The $10,000 goal will cover a portion of the following:

Production Equipment


Raw Material & Fabric Expenses


Inventory (minimum
orders are required on all components to make cost effective) 


Stretch goal:  $20,000 Let's work together to get there!!
What Our Testers Are Saying…
""The kids enjoy it.  Seals completely without
risk of leaking and it's easy to store and
clean.  My son didn't want to
give it back after testing!"" - Mina F.
""Our daughter loves this type of product (squeeze pouches),
but you can't control what is in them (how much sugar, etc).  I
like that you can take it on the road with you and that it doesn't require
utensils. The ""mess"" that is left is contained in the pouch which is
nice too. No worries about crumbs, etc that come from a bagged item."" - Merryl B.

“Love the way it washes and cleans up so easy - you can flip it inside
out.  Love the concept and how you can
reuse and reuse."" - Sara

Dairy Technicians without Borders and the participants are actively supporting
the feasibility study, however we still need to raise<b> 4,100 US$ </b>to be able to

is feasible and establish the requirements to successfully complete the
project. The next step will then be to finding further associates and partners,
completing the project proposal, establishing the milk farmer´s cooperative in
Khovsgol and apply for the economical funds for the realization of the project.</span><br/></p>
<p>Both participating project partners, Danish

we are able to present a full feasibility study and project proposal.</p>
<p>The Khovsgol Dairy Facility will improve
the local milk farmer’s possibility to produce milk products of a high quality
that can be sold to a third party. As it is now, the farmers can only sell
their products locally and in a short period, because of the traditional and
primitive storage and production methods. Building a Dairy facility with
international standards for food safety and hygiene, will improve the
possibility for the farmers to sell their products outside the village to the
bigger city’s where there are potential costumers. The products will mainly be
traditional Mongolian milk products, supporting the Mongolian lifestyle and
creating a livelihood and job opportunities for the local farmers and community.</p><p>We will leave for Mongolia 4th of July 2015 and after two days in Ulaanbatar with meetings and a visit to a working dairy.  We will travel up the Khovsgol to do the field study and registration of milk production and identification of possible dairy site.</p><p>Should this campaign raise more funds that the needed 4,100$ all additional funds will be used to help the milk farmers and the local community through ecoLeap foundation <a href=""http://www.ecoleap.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.ecoLeap.org</a> </p>

June 15th - New tees!



I Shelter Nepal Tee  - $75 Donation

Rebuild Nepal Tee - $75 Donation




Nepal Badge Tee  - $75 Donation








On April 25th, a magnitude 7.8 earthquake rocked Nepal leaving many homeless. Today we're partnering with survivors to build durable shelters that keep families warm, dry, and safe from aftershocks & monsoon season.  Join our team in rebuilding Nepal by contributing to the construction of Portal Shelters.











The Plan






 Provide shelters before Monsoon season. These smart, reusable shelters cost just $100 & house one family.
 Give a Portal Cargo Bike to families in need of work. These bikes are great for transporting huge loads & are designed to fit many attachments (including a washing machine, corn husker, or phone charger), making everyday tasks more efficient & transporting a small family much easier.

Providing jobs with one simple concept. These bikes are built for business! Haul large loads of cargo, easily get around town, or start a service business using one of our simple attachments (like our washing machine)!







The Shelter


Open SourceWe provide free, 30 minute, shelter building classes for NGOs, villagers, and small teams. All of our training is also online, and we have seen many take our instructions to build shelters on their own. More info at: www.portalbikes.org/shelters


Cost EffectiveEach shelter costs $100 and can be assembled in 30 minutes or less.


Designed To Last
These shelters can withstand the rigors of monsoon season much better than a tarp or a tent, and when the monsoon is over, they can be reused or repurposed.



Zero-WasteAll the materials used to construct Portal Shelters can be reused to build more permanent homes. The frames can be reused to create greenhouses for food, the roofing can be reused in a permanent home, or the entire shelter can be reused as a barn.






The Bike







Cargo

Carry your kids to school and your goods to market. The Portal cargo bike has a huge cargo capacity but still rides like a normal bicycle.







Machine Compatible


Our bicycle quickly converts into a pedal powered machine. A rotating shaft provides power whenever the rear wheel is turning. A sturdy kickstand supports the bicycle, allowing it to be pedaled in a stationary position. Tools easily connect to the bicycle, allowing the user to pump water, grind grain, generate electricity, wash clothes, etc. If it rotates, chances are pretty good you can power it with our bicycle Power Take Off (PTO).





Tools & Accessories
Side wings can be exchanged to deliver different types of cargo. Tools can be connected and powered by the bicycle. Bags can be attached and removed. These building blocks allow the bicycle to adapt to a broad variety of applications quickly and easily. The range of possibilities is virtually infinite.










The Funding






20% of our funding will be allocated toward building 200 more temporary shelters.
40% of funds will be allocated toward building a manufacturing warehouse for cargo bikes.

40% of funds will go toward the shipment of 200 cargo bikes.

<p><b>A STAY AT FEENX CABINA'S</b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p>Beginning 6 months after our purchase of Felix Cabina's (to give us time to do some upgrades and get settled in) and claimable for 3 yrs - AIRFARE - TRANSPORTATION - FOOD and SPENDING MONEY  - NOT INCLUDED (unless we win the lottery) and completely gift-able (you prefer Alaska - no problem - give your rooms to friends or family members or even to a boss you want to impress) - Available on a first come first serve basis :) (have to be fair about these things)</p>
<p>Now for the why's </p>
<p><b>Why Costa Rica? </b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p>Warm humid air agrees with Niki's body... when she is in that environment she can work all day without tiring and WITHOUT being in pain - fresh fruit is readily available (pick it off the tree) and almost all the food in the market is organically grown and grass fed meats (both extremely important to her body and very expensive to get in Canada) - More than that, the culture suits us - we are very simple people - we don't need a lot of stuff (which is why we are selling almost everything we own) - we have discovered that the more stuff you have the more stuff you have to answer to - do you realize how much time and energy we waste of caring for - finding space for - cleaning - maintaining - repairing our stuff... literally - we are slaves to our stuff - no more...  Costa Rica is an environmentally conscious country with an amazing laid back culture - they no longer have a military (which excites us because we really don't understand war) and the people are very in tune with the basic human values that matter - family - faith - friendship...</p>
<p>We have contacts with people there who own larger facilities that would be able to house the fibro retreat attendees and who are also members of the natural health and wellness community.  Basically - it has EVERYTHING we need...</p>
<p><b>Why Felix Cabina's?</b></p>
<p>Because it's small, easily manageable (it will still leave us lots of time for Foundation and retreat work) - it caters the to backpacking community (whom we happen to adore spending time with) and it has VAST POTENTIAL - with a little bit of paint - some construction and some creative artistic ingenuity the place could be FABULOUS... as it stands it's already a gem... we just want to take what they have created and expand on it - speaking of expanding - there is an vacant lot right next to it that may come up for sale in the future and would allow us to expand the cabinas to accommodate more guests.  It is a ten minute walk away from the beach (morning coffee and sunrise stroll anyone) and it is close to all the amenities that the town of Uvita has to offer (you can walk to the grocery store if you feel so inclined) </p>
<p><b>Why US - WHY NOW?</b></p>
<p>As for the why now... this has quite possibly been Niki's hardest winter.  there were weeks at a time when it was impossible for her to even get dressed with out help. It turns out that the only thing left that her body does not appreciate is extreme cold/dry weather.  In the summer she thrives; but once winter comes she slows down to a crawl and has to seriously limit her diet in order to reduce the symptoms to a tolerable limit.  So the short answer is, whether or not we have a place to go to, we're going... This is our family saying that we will do WHATEVER it takes for her to be healthy.  She has been teaching 'self first' to others through her work for the last few years and we all feel that it would be unfair of us to not practice what we preach.   How can she ask people to fight for her health if she won't do it herself.  </p>
<p>It was actually her fellow film makers Lucien Noe and Richard O'Shields who made this all possible - Lucien thanks to his unquestionable dedication and concern for her well-being and Richard for his gift of a trip to get her somewhere that he knew would make her feel better.   Their efforts inspired a much needed and timely shift in mindset and has set us both on a path with purpose.  She has already begun writing about her experiences with Fibro --&gt;&gt; <a href=""http://feenxrising.blogspot.ca/2015/04/the-fibromyalgia-lie.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Niki's Fibro Blog</a> and promises to continue to do so in the hopes it will help others out there who are suffering from the same illness.  </p>
<p>As to why us... Well between our experiences with Fibromyalgia, Pascal's vast experience with construction and renovation, Niki's 20 yrs customer service experience in the service industry, Niki and Pascal's artistic skill (yes Pascal can draw too)  and Niki's last 4 years of work as an author, radio show host (which has connected her with health and wellness specialists around the world, independent film maker... who better than us to pull this off and make it AWESOME?</p>
<p>Here is an example of some of the work Niki has done in the past to help others out there find their way to health and wellness...</p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fziu7vdXOCc0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dziu7vdXOCc0&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fziu7vdXOCc0%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>

<p>Educated yourself and others... we have found some fantastic info out there and we would like to share a bit with you now in the hopes that you will pass it along...</p>
<p>First - A video we stumbled upon on you tube - it's not ours but it is a fair representation of what life with Fibro is like... What struck us so much was a statement by one of the women in the video who claims that heat triggers her flare-ups - this is just more confirmation for us that Fibro is an extremely complex disease and that each individual patient needs to be treated in a unique way - this is NOT a one size fits all disease and there is NO one size fits all solution.</p>

scream to the heavens in our most desperate hour of need really answered?
     The answers can be found in the
remarkable journey of the woman who went from laying curled up on the bathroom
floor praying for God to take her home, to the woman who now believes that
faith in the Divine is just the beginning of this incredible adventure we call
life.

In alignment with our offer of transparency I will honestly tell you that each book costs us $5 US dollars to print - include shipping them here from our publishing company Grave Distractions Publications in the USA and any costs to ship them to you... Plus the time to write you a letter of gratitude ;) You're really getting quite the deal.

YOUR NAME OF THE FEENX CABINA HALL OFF FLAME...
Since 2006 Niki has been painting murals on walls... as part of our work on the Cabina's she will be filling all the empty walls with murals once they have fresh coats of paint.  There is one large exterior wall that faces the road and is the first thing people see when they enter the gate; this wall will be dedicated to a stylized piece of art that will include the names of each and every person who donates to the campaign.  Once completed, this art piece will grace the front page of our website as a special tribute to all of your amazingly supportive people.  
One example of Niki's word art...


From The Heart
2006
Canvas - Metallic Acrylic 
Auction Piece for Sick Kids Charity Ball




This very special piece was designed to be auctioned to the Toronto Sick Kids Hospital Charity Ball.  Aprox. 3.5 feet wide by 5 feet tall it was a complex piece that integrated all the words that represent Sick Kids Hospital into a nature Scene - There are 8 words hidden in the painting - Understanding - Faith - Hope - Love - Life - Family - Care - Dream.

A STAY AT FEENX CABINA'S

Beginning 6 months after our purchase of Felix Cabina's (to give us time to do some upgrades and get settled in) and claimable for 3 yrs - AIRFARE - TRANSPORTATION - FOOD and SPENDING MONEY  - NOT INCLUDED (unless we win the lottery) and completely gift-able (you prefer Alaska - no problem - give your rooms to friends or family members or even to a boss you want to impress) - Available on a first come first serve basis :) (have to be fair about these things)
Now for the why's 
Why Costa Rica? 

Warm humid air agrees with Niki's body... when she is in that environment she can work all day without tiring and WITHOUT being in pain - fresh fruit is readily available (pick it off the tree) and almost all the food in the market is organically grown and grass fed meats (both extremely important to her body and very expensive to get in Canada) - More than that, the culture suits us - we are very simple people - we don't need a lot of stuff (which is why we are selling almost everything we own) - we have discovered that the more stuff you have the more stuff you have to answer to - do you realize how much time and energy we waste of caring for - finding space for - cleaning - maintaining - repairing our stuff... literally - we are slaves to our stuff - no more...  Costa Rica is an environmentally conscious country with an amazing laid back culture - they no longer have a military (which excites us because we really don't understand war) and the people are very in tune with the basic human values that matter - family - faith - friendship...
We have contacts with people there who own larger facilities that would be able to house the fibro retreat attendees and who are also members of the natural health and wellness community.  Basically - it has EVERYTHING we need...
Why Felix Cabina's?
Because it's small, easily manageable (it will still leave us lots of time for Foundation and retreat work) - it caters the to backpacking community (whom we happen to adore spending time with) and it has VAST POTENTIAL - with a little bit of paint - some construction and some creative artistic ingenuity the place could be FABULOUS... as it stands it's already a gem... we just want to take what they have created and expand on it - speaking of expanding - there is an vacant lot right next to it that may come up for sale in the future and would allow us to expand the cabinas to accommodate more guests.  It is a ten minute walk away from the beach (morning coffee and sunrise stroll anyone) and it is close to all the amenities that the town of Uvita has to offer (you can walk to the grocery store if you feel so inclined) 
Why US - WHY NOW?
As for the why now... this has quite possibly been Niki's hardest winter.  there were weeks at a time when it was impossible for her to even get dressed with out help. It turns out that the only thing left that her body does not appreciate is extreme cold/dry weather.  In the summer she thrives; but once winter comes she slows down to a crawl and has to seriously limit her diet in order to reduce the symptoms to a tolerable limit.  So the short answer is, whether or not we have a place to go to, we're going... This is our family saying that we will do WHATEVER it takes for her to be healthy.  She has been teaching 'self first' to others through her work for the last few years and we all feel that it would be unfair of us to not practice what we preach.   How can she ask people to fight for her health if she won't do it herself.  
It was actually her fellow film makers Lucien Noe and Richard O'Shields who made this all possible - Lucien thanks to his unquestionable dedication and concern for her well-being and Richard for his gift of a trip to get her somewhere that he knew would make her feel better.   Their efforts inspired a much needed and timely shift in mindset and has set us both on a path with purpose.  She has already begun writing about her experiences with Fibro -->> Niki's Fibro Blog and promises to continue to do so in the hopes it will help others out there who are suffering from the same illness.  
As to why us... Well between our experiences with Fibromyalgia, Pascal's vast experience with construction and renovation, Niki's 20 yrs customer service experience in the service industry, Niki and Pascal's artistic skill (yes Pascal can draw too)  and Niki's last 4 years of work as an author, radio show host (which has connected her with health and wellness specialists around the world, independent film maker... who better than us to pull this off and make it AWESOME?
Here is an example of some of the work Niki has done in the past to help others out there find their way to health and wellness...

If you want a little reassurance that we have the resources  you can stop by the radio show website to listen to the archives...           Everyday Connection

NOW FOR THE BIG BIG QUESTION... 
How else can YOU help???
SHARE SHARE SHARE!!!
No seriously SHARE !!!
but beyond that - you can support us financially by other means as well and still get something in return... 
You can go to Niki's publishers website and BUY HER BOOK 
Grave Distractions Publications
Contact her directly to commission art work
CONTACT NIKI
But beyond that - What is most important to us is AWARENESS - UNDERSTANDING and above all COMPASSION <3 <3 <3 
Educated yourself and others... we have found some fantastic info out there and we would like to share a bit with you now in the hopes that you will pass it along...
First - A video we stumbled upon on you tube - it's not ours but it is a fair representation of what life with Fibro is like... What struck us so much was a statement by one of the women in the video who claims that heat triggers her flare-ups - this is just more confirmation for us that Fibro is an extremely complex disease and that each individual patient needs to be treated in a unique way - this is NOT a one size fits all disease and there is NO one size fits all solution.

And of course there are tonnes of articles out there from reputable Fibromyalgia awareness websites that are helping to shed light on this disorder...
This AMAZING article ABOUT HEALTH on the challenges of living with Fibro
This INCREDIBLE read from BUT YOU DON""T LOOK SICK called 'The Spoon Theory'
Extensive SYMPTOM list by LIVING SMARTER WITH FIBROMYALGIA
12 Steps to Understanding Someone With Chronic Pain by WIKI HOW
Having Fibromyalgia sucks!!! For many who have it there is a fear of speaking openly to friends and family about it - there has for far too long been the misconception that Fibro in all in the mind... combine that belief with the complex, invisible, hard to explain symptoms and many simply feel that they have no way to be heard - LET'S END THE SILENCE...
 Talk about it - write about it - make video's about it...
Tweet it - Blog it - Tumblr it - Facey Spacey it...
Get LinkedIn to it... 
WHATEVER YOU HAVE TO DO to let the people out there who have this disease know that THEY ARE NOT ALONE < 3 
you never know - just telling somebody you care just may be enough to save a life <3
Stay tuned for up dates like...

The most important problem facing the initiative is too high requirements for market access of the small producers and that the homemade food sales are not regulated yet.<div>    <p>To resolve the need for more sustainable food on the market by more implemented organic farmers and food artisans, this project aims at providing them cooperative advantage for learning, creating, producing, selling and training new generation of entrepreneurs. Deprived farmers and artisans can share common resources now to meet the legal requirements, to develop and pass further their valuable skills and knowledge.</p>
<p>The Farm Craft Kitchen is a creative and innovative place in Plovdiv, Bulgaria combining kitchen, shop, takeaway corner for cooked local food, training space and  farmers’ market in the open. Local farmers will produce and deliver sustainable production to the shop and kitchen, the chefs will cook seasonal local food, and all together will be trained in entrepreneurship, will work together and grow as a community and mentors for future talents. It is a pilot project, that in the near future we plan to implement in 3 other cities in Bulgaria where our NGO is also organizing farmers' markets (Sofia, Varna and Burgas).</p>

<p>Hundreds of young people in Bulgaria are engaged passionately with organic gardening and authentic food handicrafts as bakery, confectionery, cheese making, traditional vegetable and fruit processing, beekeeping and others. But most of them have serious
difficulties to access the market because of papers, no financial capacity and experience, the local food market being undeveloped. Generally, the Bulgarian food legislation is based on the industrial model with very high requirements for small producers that impose unnecessary investments and monitoring.</p>
<p>By sharing common production space, procedures, resources, consumers and knowledge the deprived talents will have better opportunities for realization. Through this project of
cooperation we create conditions for practicing their passions, market access, enriching their knowledge and experience and the opportunity further to be mentors to new talents. Moreover, we strive to create a small producers community in which they can outshine. A community where they will grow as trainers and status quo reformers. </p>

хора в България сърцато се занимават с биоградинарство и кулинарно занаятчийство - хлебарство, сладкарство, приготвяне на сирене,

Повечето от тях обаче имат сериозни затруднения за достъп до пазара поради сложна документация, липса на финансов капацитет и опит, както и заради неразвития пазар на местни храни. Като цяло българското законодателство за храните се основава на индустриалния модел с твърде високи изисквания за малките производители, които налагат ненужни инвестиции и

leave in the local economics instead of foreign supermarket chains.</p>

The most important problem facing the initiative is too high requirements for market access of the small producers and that the homemade food sales are not regulated yet.    To resolve the need for more sustainable food on the market by more implemented organic farmers and food artisans, this project aims at providing them cooperative advantage for learning, creating, producing, selling and training new generation of entrepreneurs. Deprived farmers and artisans can share common resources now to meet the legal requirements, to develop and pass further their valuable skills and knowledge.
The Farm Craft Kitchen is a creative and innovative place in Plovdiv, Bulgaria combining kitchen, shop, takeaway corner for cooked local food, training space and  farmers’ market in the open. Local farmers will produce and deliver sustainable production to the shop and kitchen, the chefs will cook seasonal local food, and all together will be trained in entrepreneurship, will work together and grow as a community and mentors for future talents. It is a pilot project, that in the near future we plan to implement in 3 other cities in Bulgaria where our NGO is also organizing farmers' markets (Sofia, Varna and Burgas).

Нашата НПО - Сдружение ""Устойчиво общество"", е юридическото лице на движението Хранкооп - най-мащабната инициатива на устойчивото общество в България до момента за директни връзки между фермерите и производителите, както и пионер в организирането на фермерски пазари в страната. Най-значимият проблем пред инициативата са твърде високите изисквания към малките производители за достъп до пазара, както и че продаването на домашно приготвена храна, все още не е регламентирано.

За да разреши необходимостта от повече здравословни храни на пазара с повече реализирани биопроизводители и кулинарни занаятчии, този проект дава кооперативно решение за тяхното обучение, креативност, производство на продукция, продажби и подготовка на следващо поколение предприемачи. Фермерите и занаятчиите без възможности вече ще могат да споделят общи ресурси, за да отговарят на законовите изисквания, да се развиват и да предават нататък ценните си умения и знания.
Занаятчийска кухня ""Фермата"" е място за творчество и иновации в Пловдив, което комбинира малка кухня, магазин и щанд за приготвени местни храни, пространство за обучения и фермерски пазар на открито. Местните фермери ще произвеждат и доставят чиста продукция за магазина и кухнята, младите даровити кулинари ще приготвят сезонни храни от нея, а всички заедно ще се обучават за предприемачи, ще работят заедно и ще се развиват като общност и ментори за бъдещи занаятчии. Това е пилотен проект, който планираме в близко бъдеще да имплементираме в други 3 града на България, където нашето сдружение също провежда фермерски пазари (София, Варна и Бургас).







Hundreds of young people in Bulgaria are engaged passionately with organic gardening and authentic food handicrafts as bakery, confectionery, cheese making, traditional vegetable and fruit processing, beekeeping and others. But most of them have serious
difficulties to access the market because of papers, no financial capacity and experience, the local food market being undeveloped. Generally, the Bulgarian food legislation is based on the industrial model with very high requirements for small producers that impose unnecessary investments and monitoring.
By sharing common production space, procedures, resources, consumers and knowledge the deprived talents will have better opportunities for realization. Through this project of
cooperation we create conditions for practicing their passions, market access, enriching their knowledge and experience and the opportunity further to be mentors to new talents. Moreover, we strive to create a small producers community in which they can outshine. A community where they will grow as trainers and status quo reformers. 
Стотици млади
хора в България сърцато се занимават с биоградинарство и кулинарно занаятчийство - хлебарство, сладкарство, приготвяне на сирене,
традиционна преработка на плодове и зеленчуци, пчеларство и други. Повечето от тях обаче имат сериозни затруднения за достъп до пазара поради сложна документация, липса на финансов капацитет и опит, както и заради неразвития пазар на местни храни. Като цяло българското законодателство за храните се основава на индустриалния модел с твърде високи изисквания за малките производители, които налагат ненужни инвестиции и
мониторинг.
Чрез споделянето
на общо производствено пространство, процедури, ресурси, потребители и знания талантливите производители без възможности ще имат по-добри шансове за реализация. С този кооперативен проект ние създаваме условия те да следват мечтите си, осигуряваме им достъп
до пазара, даваме им възможности да обогатяват своите знания и опит, както и перспективата да бъдат ментори на следваща генерация занаятчии. Освен това, ние се стремим да създадем общност на малките производители, чрез която те да преуспяват. Общност, в която те ще
се развиват като обучители и реформатори на статуквото.



We
already found Our Place- it’s a renovated small house in the heart of the historical
district in Plovdiv- Kapana, center of the creative industries and crafts.
The
total budget needed to open The Farm Craft Kitchen in July 2015  is € 7,210. We already gain funding for rent the house - € 2,000 from the Municipal Foundation Plovdiv 2019.  This crowdfunding campaign aims to gain €
5,210 by June 20 with which we are going to buy the kitchen equipment, the shop furnishings and the kitchen
registration.
Ние вече намерихме Нашето Местенце. Това е една малка реновирана къща в сърцето на квартал Капана в Пловдив - център на творческите индустрии и занаяти.


Общият бюджет, необходим за да отворим Занаятчийска кухня ""Фермата"" през юли 2015 г. е € 7210. Вече спечелихме финансиране на наема за 1 година (€ 2000) от Общинска Фондация ""Пловдив 2019"". А с тази фондонабираща кампания целим да спечелим € 5210 до 20 юни, като с тези средства ще можем да закупим кухненско оборудване, обзавеждане на магазина и регистрация на кухнята.






Young and deprived food talents are the core of The Farm Craft Kitchen. We will train and support them in food preparation, food entrepreneurship and food justice. They'll also take part in The Farm Craft Kitchen decision making and have equity in our business.
In benefit of the local economic we will support the growth of many small farmers who will have stability in selling their production. They will be motivated to vary their products and will be fairly paid for the labour. The money which the consumers spend will
leave in the local economics instead of foreign supermarket chains.
Citizens will have better access and variety of sustainable local food.
We will revive and develop the culinary history of local, national and European level.
Creativity of our youth educations and workshops, open for the society will lead essential role in minimizing the consumerism effect.
The project implementation at the national scale will improve potential and knowledge of the food artisan’s community so they will push policies to simplify the requirements for small producers and will contribute to the regulation of homemade food production in
Bulgaria.
Младите и лишени от възможности талантливи занаятчии са ядрото на Занаятчийска кухня ""Фермата"". Ние ще ги обучаваме и ще подкрепяме тяхното желание да приготвят автентични храни, да развиват предприемачески умения и хранителна справедливост. Те също така ще участват във вземането на решения във ""Фермата"" и ще имат равнопоставеност в нашия бизнес.
В полза на местната икономика ще подпомагаме растежа на много малки фермери, които ще имат повече сигурност за реализация на продукцията си. Те ще бъдат мотивирани да разнообразяват асортимента си и ще получават справедливо заплащане за труда си. Парите, които потребителите плащат, ще остават в местната икономика, вместо в чуждестранните вериги супермаркети.



Гражданите ще имат по-добър достъп и разнообразие от чиста местна храна.
Ще съживим и развием кулинарната история на местно, национално и европейско ниво.
Творческият аспект на младежките ни обучения и семинари, отворени за обществеността, ще допринесе съществено за минимизиране ефекта на консуматорството.

Надграждането на проекта в национален мащаб ще подобри потенциала и познанията на общността от кулинарни занаятчии, така че да могат да водят успешни политики за опростяване на изискванията към малките производители и ще допринесе за регламентиране на домашното производство на храни в България.

labour has complications (for example when caesarean section is necessary)
women always have right for safety standards.</b></p>
<p>In many European countries perinatal procedures are reduced.
There are no standards for prenatal examinations. Frequently lack of the right
qualification cause problems for European 
hospitals. Only fully healthy mothers can give birth naturally. Stress
and other environmental factors are the main reasons for increasing number of
non-natural labours.</p>
<p>We want all babies to have safe childbirth. Unfortunatelly
lack of european standards is putting both mothers and doctors in very bad
situation. Women and doctors don't have ability to provide professional and
early help to mothers and children which were prenatally diagnosed with serious
disorders, like for example Down syndrome or spina bifida.</p>
<p>Only complex european solutions can be a guarantee of
safety during the labour and also on following years if the child would need
further rehabilitation or different medical care. In practice in many European
countries mothers of disabled children (including children disabled because of
medical malpractice) can rely only on help of non-governmental organisations.</p>
<p>Our fight for equal perinatal european
standards are worth supporting. „Safe Childbirth” is a project of people and
organizations from different countries that are engaged in creating equal
european standards of perinatal health care. Our goal is to educate and to get
funds from European Union for buying medical devices to the hospitals and
training doctors, midwifes and patients. We believe that mothers need to know
their laws and when they should be aware of medical staff. Our purpose is
safety of mothers and children and in consequence- higher number of births.</p>
<p>We want to prepare the goverments and EU's institutions to
increase expenditure for perinatal health care, so the growth of healthy new
generation would be possible. To make it happen it is essential to make
informative action which could convince them to our postulates. Otherwise more
and more European women will decide not to have babies, which will be a cause
of European demographic problem.</p>

When I was told that my daughter can't be saved I have founded the foundation that has been working for a year www.lilkapomaga.plI'm working on prevention of medical malpractice during the labour and educating mothers before the labour. Only now I know that there are so many risks that can eventuate in death or disability of a child. Perinatal asphyxia is mostly caused by medical errors, malpractice and wrong examination.My mission has started. Please support me in this mission:

We are the mothers- ordinary women- and our tragedies has
brought us together. Our children could have a normal life. We think that our
current life is caused by lack of perinatal standards that in consequence has
led to medical malpractice. We believe, that this situation can be changed.
Each of us proves every day that change is possible. 
We want to make one common perinatal standard that will
protect mothers, children and also create health care standards for children
disabled because of medical malpractice during the labour. 

We believe that every European woman has the right for safe
childbirth no matter if she is using public health care or she wants to give
birth in home. We categorically oppose to breaking procedures and perinatal
health care standards. No matter if the woman is giving birth naturally or the
labour has complications (for example when caesarean section is necessary)

</div></div>","Saving the World, One R/C Vehicle at a Time!
Well, not really (but that video pumps us up every time!).  The truth is, our mission at R/C Playground (RCP) is not to save the world.  It is neither dangerous, daring nor particularly radical.  In fact, if you're like us and have been around the hobby for a while, the idea behind RCP makes perfect sense:  create a friendly place where folks  who love R/C can just PLAY, LEARN, and SHARE.   Don't get us wrong, we love R/C racing -- but the truth is, for a variety of reasons, organized racing accommodates only a fraction of the many enthusiasts out there. For most of us non-racers, including kids and those still learning the hobby, our choices for getting the most out of R/C have been slim to none.   
Until now.


Crawler competitors at the RCP Summer Jam!
Who is R/C Playground?
First, RCP is NOT a hobby shop!  In fact, we're partnered with lots of great local and online hobby shops who support what we're trying to do, which is to provide a fun, safe place to enjoy your hard earned gear!  Into drifting?  Bashing?  How about crawling?  We know, maybe SPEED's your thing?  Like boats?  Planes?  Quads?  Want to just have fun with your toys?  Settle a friendly bet?  Tired of running all your awesome gear alone?  Want a friendly place to learn the ropes? Or perhaps you're more of a tinkerer than a driver?  Love to paint and design? You get the picture:  WHATEVER it is that you love about this great hobby, we want RCP to be the place where you can enjoy R/C the way YOU want to enjoy it!
Our staff has over 60 years of combined experience in R/C, and we've met tons of new friends who share our passions!  We've spent the last 6 months blasting away on social media, touring Georgia with promotional R/C events and exhibitions featuring our pro drivers (Team RCP), talking with fellow enthusiasts, hobby shops, community organizations, spreading the word about RCP, and trying to get an idea of exactly how the Playground can best accommodate the wide range of R/C interests out there.  Each event has been bigger than the last, and we've literally met hundreds of folks eager to share their ideas about the perfect R/C facility.  


RCP Founder Jimmy knows it's all about the customer experience!!
In a nutshell, here's what we learned:  you want a welcoming yet competitive place to play and hang out with fellow enthusiasts. You want fresh ideas and innovation, and fewer rules and restrictions. You don't want to feel like an outlaw, no matter who you are or what you run.  You want a place to go big, no compromises, no half-measures.  And you want it now.  
Most importantly, your enthusiasm convinced us that RCP could be the answer.  





The Next Step for RCP
We're closer than ever to making our dreams of a permanent facility a reality! RCP is working closely with consultants to develop a strategic business plan that is scalable and relatively low risk, and we've found several great locations in the surrounding metro Atlanta area that would be perfect for the new RCP!  


While we work on the ""business end"" and securing a new facility, it's time to start planning RCP's next community event, and with your help, we hope to make it our biggest and best yet!   Much more than our typical promotional event, we need to show our many supporters in the R/C community, including our fellow hobbyists, local businesses, team sponsors, and investors, that our team is ready for the next step!  If you've been to any of our events, you know we work hard to provide a fun, challenging, and open environment for all of our guests -- but this time, we're raising the bar to really show how great a permanent RCP can be! There's even a chance the event could be held at a potential long-term site!
Tentatively scheduled for late-August, the multi-day event will feature:



INDOOR tracks for RC drift, crawl, on/off-road, and more!

Additional outdoor features for off-road, touring, bashing, quads, and more!
Indoor pit area with work space, power, DIY tools, and full service offerings -- space for 30+ drivers!
Rental and demo vehicles of all types!
Build/maintenance/upgrade/repair workshops for enthusiasts of all levels!
Lounge area with TVs, video games, and concessions!






How YOU can help! 
We are so grateful for the continued donations of time, labor, skills, equipment, and valuable advice -- your enthusiasm has kept us going from day one!  We've taken that energy and put everything we have into turning RCP into something we can all be proud of!  Our dedicated team of staff/supporters is ready to keep working -- but now we need YOUR help to take this event to the next level! 
Your contributions of ANY amount can make a huge difference to us and will go directly toward getting the venue ready for the event (and hopefully, beyond!).  This includes:

Track materials, including lumber and landscaping supplies
Pit/service area materials for work space and shop supplies
Operating costs, including facility rental and utilities
Promotional/advertising/community outreach costs

Most of the materials you help us secure can be used well beyond this next big event (ie for the permanent home and/or future events) so your valuable donations won't just be helping us throw the biggest R/C party this area has ever seen, but are an important investment into RCP's future!
Until now, we've never asked for a penny (outside of select competition entry fees to cover admin costs).  But we're at an important crossroads now as we begin to transition from promoting an idea to running a business.  We knew it would be a tough road, but we have also been encouraged by all the support we've gathered along the way -- we know that together, we can build the R/C utopia we've always dreamed of!  If you support what we're trying to do for our R/C community and beyond, please contribute!

always had a passion for animals, dogs have a special place in my heart.<span>  </span>My dog, Opie, inspired me to start this
business.<span>  </span>Back in 2008, after a
long, sleepless night of smelling his breath, I set out to find a
solution.<span>  </span>After discovering all of
the mass-produced dog treats were full of unrecognizable chemicals, I knew I
could make a better treat using high-quality, all-natural ingredients.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: normal;""><span style='font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: ""Segoe UI""; color: black;'> </span><span style=""font-family: 'Segoe UI'; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">In 2013, I started selling treats professionally at the Farmer’s
Market in Rocky Mount, NC.<span>  </span>It
didn’t take long to develop a loyal customer base that eagerly anticipated my
next treat offering.<span>  </span>Since then,
I’ve expanded into two retail locations: Pet’s Best Friend, a doggie daycare in
Rocky Mount, and Quirky and Quaint, a cute little gift store in Nashville.<span>  </span>I’ve also formed a partnership with
Twin Oaks Farm to sell pre-packaged treats at the Pitt County Farmer’s Market
in Greenville and have participated in numerous special events including Barktoberfest,
Bark &amp; Wine and Bark for Life.<span> 
</span>I love interacting with new and repeat customers at all of these
venues.<span>  </span>Not only do I share the
knowledge I’ve gained in my research to make a top-notch product, I listen to
what customers are looking for (gluten-free, wheat-free, etc.) and adjust my
product line based on those needs.<span> </span></span></p>

my business on a daily basis.<span>  </span>With
that in mind, I recently purchased a new Transit Connect Wagon and have been working
with a printing company to have a custom wrap put on it to advertise my
business.<span>  </span>Not only will this
colorful rolling banner elevate Kansas Sweetie Barkery’s visibility in the
community, it will serve as a pseudo-food truck wherever I am.<span>  </span>Just like an ice cream truck, customers
will know they can pick up a special treat for their beloved pup anytime,
anyplace.<span> </span></span></p>

purchasing the vehicle.<span>  </span>If I don't
collect enough to pay for the cost of the wrap, then I’ll eat ramen for however
long it takes to pay for the project because that’s how much I believe this is
the right step to get more dogs eating good quality treats.</span></p>

recognize publicity is a huge component to a successful business.<span>  </span>The Kansas Sweetie Barkery (KSB)
custom-designed advertising wrap will be an eye-catching reminder that
high-quality, all-natural treats are for sale anytime you see the KSB
vehicle.<span>  </span>Every sale is an

</div></div>","Short Summary
My name is Brie Handgraaf and I am the proud owner of Kansas
Sweetie Barkery (KSB).  While I’ve
always had a passion for animals, dogs have a special place in my heart.  My dog, Opie, inspired me to start this
business.  Back in 2008, after a
long, sleepless night of smelling his breath, I set out to find a
solution.  After discovering all of
the mass-produced dog treats were full of unrecognizable chemicals, I knew I
could make a better treat using high-quality, all-natural ingredients.
 In 2013, I started selling treats professionally at the Farmer’s
Market in Rocky Mount, NC.  It
didn’t take long to develop a loyal customer base that eagerly anticipated my
next treat offering.  Since then,
I’ve expanded into two retail locations: Pet’s Best Friend, a doggie daycare in
Rocky Mount, and Quirky and Quaint, a cute little gift store in Nashville.  I’ve also formed a partnership with
Twin Oaks Farm to sell pre-packaged treats at the Pitt County Farmer’s Market
in Greenville and have participated in numerous special events including Barktoberfest,
Bark & Wine and Bark for Life. 
I love interacting with new and repeat customers at all of these
venues.  Not only do I share the
knowledge I’ve gained in my research to make a top-notch product, I listen to
what customers are looking for (gluten-free, wheat-free, etc.) and adjust my
product line based on those needs. 
 With sales growing exponentially, I knew it was time to showcase
my business on a daily basis.  With
that in mind, I recently purchased a new Transit Connect Wagon and have been working
with a printing company to have a custom wrap put on it to advertise my
business.  Not only will this
colorful rolling banner elevate Kansas Sweetie Barkery’s visibility in the
community, it will serve as a pseudo-food truck wherever I am.  Just like an ice cream truck, customers
will know they can pick up a special treat for their beloved pup anytime,
anyplace. 
I need your help as we move from the drawing board to reality with
the Kansas Sweetie Barkery custom advertising wrap.  Any contribution, no matter how small or large, would be
greatly appreciated.   Thank
you so much for all you do to make my business a success!  --Brie Handgraaf--
 
What I Need:
All funds raised will go toward the print and installation of the
Kansas Sweetie Barkery custom-designed wrap.  Any additional donations will be used to pay down the cost of
purchasing the vehicle.  If I don't
collect enough to pay for the cost of the wrap, then I’ll eat ramen for however
long it takes to pay for the project because that’s how much I believe this is
the right step to get more dogs eating good quality treats.
Why Me?
As a newspaper reporter and mass communication specialist, I
recognize publicity is a huge component to a successful business.  The Kansas Sweetie Barkery (KSB)
custom-designed advertising wrap will be an eye-catching reminder that
high-quality, all-natural treats are for sale anytime you see the KSB
vehicle.  Every sale is an
opportunity to share my passion and knowledge learned as I’ve grown this
business.  It is my goal to provide
a superior product to all of my dog-loving customers!  
 Other Ways You
Can Help
While I love my job as a newspaper reporter, I understand what
it’s like to live on a limited budget. 
If you can’t donate to this fundraising campaign, that’s OK, there are
still plenty of ways you can support Kansas Sweetie Barkery (KSB).  Word of mouth is a powerful tool and it
would be great if you could tell all your dog-loving friends about our
handmade, all-natural treats. 
Pass along the information about KSB’s Indigogo campaign and share it on
social media.  Hopefully, they will
be inspired to donate.  Visit our
webpage at KansasSweetieBarkery.vpweb.com
and follow us
on Facebook.  Any support is valued
and very much appreciated!

FAQs
This campaign is being run with the flexible funding model, so even if I don't make the full goal of $5,000, the money I do raise will go toward Kansas Sweetie Barkery. Also, some people have asked how much Indiegogo gets out of the campaign. Of course, they do take a cut, but it is only 5%. When it comes to receiving the funds, Indiegogo holds the funds until 15 days after my campaign has ended and then the amount will go into my business' bank account. Also, I've had several contributors request that I save the perks and invest the savings back in the biz... I LOVE YOU GUYS and if that is what you'd like, feel free to send an email to KansasSweetieBarkery@gmail.com saying so (I wish the site had an ability for you to click a box and skip the gifts, but apparently that isn't an option).

<div>My name is Eric Scott and I've been a professional tattoo artist for the past seven years and have done over hundreds of tattoos. I grew frustrated working in shops that didn't allow me to grow as an artist and insisted on a one size fits all mentality. People get tattoos for all different reasons. I don't believe in tracing or slapping on a tattoo. I believe in customizing tattoos that are unique to the individual. I'm looking to open my own shop that features respectable tattoo artists where people of all backgrounds can feel welcome. It doesn't matter if you're 16 or 60, you are welcome in our studio!</div> </div> <div> <h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Free tattoos!?? Keep Reading</span></h3>
<h3><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 26px;background-color: initial;"">So here's the scoop. I need $25,000 to get this studio up and running so we can start creating these tattoos.  This is going towards equipment and remodeling. Quality tattoos don't come cheap! I know your money is valuable so as a thank you for your support RudeInk Studio would like to offer the following:</span></h3>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>In addition to offering one of a kind tattoos, RudeInk Tattoo and Piercing Studio will employ local tattoo artists and bring jobs to the local economy.

</div></div>","Welcome to RudeInk Tattoo and Piercing Studio
My name is Eric Scott and I've been a professional tattoo artist for the past seven years and have done over hundreds of tattoos. I grew frustrated working in shops that didn't allow me to grow as an artist and insisted on a one size fits all mentality. People get tattoos for all different reasons. I don't believe in tracing or slapping on a tattoo. I believe in customizing tattoos that are unique to the individual. I'm looking to open my own shop that features respectable tattoo artists where people of all backgrounds can feel welcome. It doesn't matter if you're 16 or 60, you are welcome in our studio!   Free tattoos!?? Keep Reading
So here's the scoop. I need $25,000 to get this studio up and running so we can start creating these tattoos.  This is going towards equipment and remodeling. Quality tattoos don't come cheap! I know your money is valuable so as a thank you for your support RudeInk Studio would like to offer the following:
$20 Level: Rudeink Sticker
$50 Level: RudeInk T Shirt (plus above)
$100 Level: 1 Custom Rudeink Design Print (plus above)
$300 Level: 3 Custom RudeInk Design (plus above)
$500-$1000 Level: Complimentary RudeInk tattoo (plus above)

    The Impact In addition to offering one of a kind tattoos, RudeInk Tattoo and Piercing Studio will employ local tattoo artists and bring jobs to the local economy. Our projections indicate that opening our studio will create a minimum of five jobs for the area. So when you donate, not only do you get some sweet tattoos you're also supporting your local economy. How's that for a win.

</p><p>Hey there! We are Marshall Wible (Grindbore) and Genevieve
Koberstein (Brunhildurrr), two illustrators based in Savannah, Georgia. We both
attended the Savannah College of Art and Design, and when we’re not working our
day jobs, we create illustrations, books, comics, flash sheets and stickers. We
have quite the multitude of work, and we’ve decided that we want to take it to
the next level. </p>
<p>Here’s a little information on who we are: </p>
<p>
Marshall “Grindbore” Wible went to the Savannah
College of Art and Design for Sequential Art and now utilizes his hard-earned
scribbling abilities to churn out pages upon pages of artwork nobody ever sees.
His story began in grade school when he was the uncool kid drawing totally cool
pictures of dragons and swords during class. To this day, he remains the uncool
kid drawing totally cool pictures of dragons and swords, but has also branched
out to stuff like skulls, wizards, daggers and stuff from old video games. It
has long been a dream of Grindbore’s to clothe and bedazzle the masses. Let him
clothe you. <br/></p><p><b>Contact</b> - sgt.marshie@gmail.com<br/></p><p><b>Instagram</b> - thatdudegrindbore<br/></p><p>Genevieve
""Genni"" Koberstein is a freelance illustrator originally from Eugene,
Oregon. She has a Bachelors in illustration and a minor in scientific
illustration. Her influences consist of nature, biology, astronomy, the complex
patterns that are found in our macroscopic world, as well as the microscopic
world invisible to the human eye.</p>
<p>She is
always open to freelance work (including scientific illustration),
collaborations, and trying entirely new ways of executing work. Her favorite
mediums include watercolor, ink and digital, although she is experienced in
many different materials and techniques.</p>

<p>  We’ve had
the idea of an online store for a long time, and we want to make it a reality.
Our issue is that between rent and student loans, we are low on the extra funds

higher quality prints, stickers, buttons, T-shirts, patches, shrinkydink (keychains, necklaces, earrings, etc.) and eventually
tapestries. Who knows, maybe we could even have full bedspreads with our
designs! Or produce a monthly zine! All of this could be a reality, but we are

<h3><i>Resurrecting a Local Landmark</i></h3>
<p>For the better part of the 20th century, the State Theatre of Anderson, Indiana, existed to entertain the masses through feature films and live acts, including Rodney Carrington and George Carlin. Originally opened in 1930, the State Theatre boasted the first geothermal cooling system in the state, allowing patrons to watch some of the first ""talkie"" films in a ""healthfully cooled"" atmosphere. </p>
<p>Much to the dismay of Anderson residents and those passionate about the local landmark, the State Theatre eventually closed and fell into disrepair. To this day, despite numerous repairs already made, the theatre sits along Meridian Street still waiting to experience new life like its older ""cousin"", the Paramount Theatre just down the street.</p>
<p>We represent MadCo Entertainment, LLC., a new entertainment company spearheaded by Brent Doster and Branden Holder, two passionate entrepreneurs who already operate their individual businesses in the area. Both Anderson University alumni a decade apart, we have worked together professionally and personally for almost six years. Our collaboration presents a uniquely balanced yin and yang of business acumen and marketing/brand management that hopes to breathe a new existence into the State Theatre as a multi-purpose live entertainment venue. </p>
<h3><i>What We Need</i></h3>
</div><div>
<p>Our undertaking at the State Theatre is a project with multiple phases due to the scope of repairs, upgrades, etc. that are necessary to make the State the best it can be. The basics of our initial plan are as follows:</p>

<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><font><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">For this phase, we are seeking funds to cover basic renovations for bathroom upgrades (ADA compliance, aesthetic and structural renovations), water damaged plaster, damaged paint, ceiling and plaster repairs/upgrades in the balcony,  seating options, sound/light equipment, and materials to rebuild the front of the stage, as well as our nominal food/drink equipment if possible. The building will also need to be </span>tuck pointed<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> in the near future for preserving the exterior brick facade and for maintaining long-term watertightness. Our goal will be to complete rehabbing and upgrading the facility to host the best local, regional, and touring music/comedy/entertainment acts available.</span></font></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><font><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">In order to remain economical on construction costs, we will be performing a large portion of the basic ""ground floor"" renovations ourselves--including some of the plaster repair, </span>bathroom<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> upgrades, repainting, etc. Additional funds are needed to hire contractors for the ""higher up"" repairs/upgrades to the ceiling, medallions, and any residual plumbing/electrical necessities.</span></font></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Additional phases will continue to evolve as we open the doors and begin booking shows.</strong></p>

<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><i>The Impact</i></h3>
<p>In the heart of downtown Anderson a renaissance is taking place where passionate individuals are planting their roots and building bridges to create a new kind of city where community, creativity, and culture form the structure of day-to-day life.  The State Theatre offers a multi-tiered approach to creating a positive contribution to downtown Anderson's revitalization and entertainment push. Through hosting live music and comedy events, noteworthy regional attractions, and eventually affordable family events inside the theatre, the landmark's resurrection and utilization will draw individuals (students, working adults, families) from within Madison County and beyond to watch the performances. This pedestrian foot traffic will expose many individuals to other businesses and offerings of downtown Anderson, thus playing a vital role in fostering the unique lifestyle district the city hopes to achieve. Our venue also offers the opportunity for private event space, as well as the ability to host charitable concerts/events to promote synergy within the community and regional non-profits.</p>
<p>The State Theatre is the first portion of our ""Hit the Bricks!"" revitalization concept to help shine a brighter light on Meridian Street (and by proxy, downtown Anderson as a whole). By increasing the foot traffic in the area, we hope to a) draw even more quality, independent shops and eateries to the area, and b) expand some of MadCo Entertainment's other concepts out into the Meridian Street area with additional entertainment-related business ventures over the next decade.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><i>Risks &amp; Challenges</i></h3>
<p>We won't lie...this is a MASSIVE undertaking and the capital required to make everything perfect (as can be) is large. There's a lot left to do inside and outside the State, a lot of upgrades and equipment that needs to be purchased, a lot of promotion and bookings required to launch properly once we have the renovations finished. A significant portion of the basic renovation work can be performed by us, but there are key components that will require contractors and skilled professionals to accomplish.</p>
<p>Successful crowdfunding would mean a significant jump on essential, unavoidable costs associated with getting this massive undertaking off the ground, but we are aware that if funding (both crowdfunding and beyond) proves ""choppy"" in the short term, we have a tiered/phased approach at renovating that would still allow us to open in a timely fashion while completing remaining renovations as we grow. The State is an old building, approaching the 90 year mark in a few years, so there are repairs waiting to be made, which is a challenge that awaits us, but so many historical buildings nationwide have received the same treatment and are still shining to this day...that is our hope for the State.</p>
<p>Anderson has a well-known history of ups and downs as far as growth and revitalization are concerned, but with the addition of Oakley Brothers Distillery, Burro Loco, Buckskin Bikes, Kettle Top Brewhouse, among other upcoming ventures downtown (e.g. a new ""farm to table"" eatery), this new wave of businesses entering the city is actively demonstrating a trend toward the specific lifestyle culture that the State Theatre hopes to amplify through live shows and events.</p>

What We Need

Our undertaking at the State Theatre is a project with multiple phases due to the scope of repairs, upgrades, etc. that are necessary to make the State the best it can be. The basics of our initial plan are as follows:

The State Theatre (Live Venue)
The first phase of our overall vision is the State Theatre itself, which includes bringing the space into the 21st century while maintaining its more classic architectural features around the space (many of which are still in tact). 
For this phase, we are seeking funds to cover basic renovations for bathroom upgrades (ADA compliance, aesthetic and structural renovations), water damaged plaster, damaged paint, ceiling and plaster repairs/upgrades in the balcony,  seating options, sound/light equipment, and materials to rebuild the front of the stage, as well as our nominal food/drink equipment if possible.

In order to remain economical on construction costs, we will be performing a large portion of the basic ""ground floor"" renovations ourselves--including some of the plaster repair, bathroom upgrades, repainting, etc. Additional funds are needed to hire contractors for the ""higher up"" repairs/upgrades to the ceiling, medallions, and any residual plumbing/electrical necessities.
Additional phases will continue to evolve as we open the doors and begin booking shows.
What You Get
Given the unique areas we have in store for our guests, we are excited to offer a variety of great rewards for your support on this grand adventure. The preview of our rewards are as follows:

 

The Impact
In the heart of downtown Anderson a renaissance is taking place where passionate individuals are planting their roots and building bridges to create a new kind of city where community, creativity, and culture form the structure of day-to-day life.  The State Theatre offers a multi-tiered approach to creating a positive contribution to downtown Anderson's revitalization and entertainment push. Through hosting live music and comedy events, noteworthy regional attractions, and eventually affordable family events inside the theatre, the landmark's resurrection and utilization will draw individuals (students, working adults, families) from within Madison County and beyond to watch the performances. This pedestrian foot traffic will expose many individuals to other businesses and offerings of downtown Anderson, thus playing a vital role in fostering the unique lifestyle district the city hopes to achieve. Our venue also offers the opportunity for private event space, as well as the ability to host charitable concerts/events to promote synergy within the community and regional non-profits.
The State Theatre is the first portion of our ""Hit the Bricks!"" revitalization concept to help shine a brighter light on Meridian Street (and by proxy, downtown Anderson as a whole). By increasing the foot traffic in the area, we hope to a) draw even more quality, independent shops and eateries to the area, and b) expand some of MadCo Entertainment's other concepts out into the Meridian Street area with additional entertainment-related business ventures over the next decade.

Risks & Challenges
We won't lie...this is a MASSIVE undertaking and the capital required to make everything perfect (as can be) is large. There's a lot left to do inside and outside the State, a lot of upgrades and equipment that needs to be purchased, a lot of promotion and bookings required to launch properly once we have the renovations finished. A significant portion of the basic renovation work can be performed by us, but there are key components that will require contractors and skilled professionals to accomplish.
Successful crowdfunding would mean a significant jump on essential, unavoidable costs associated with getting this massive undertaking off the ground, but we are aware that if funding (both crowdfunding and beyond) proves ""choppy"" in the short term, we have a tiered/phased approach at renovating that would still allow us to open in a timely fashion while completing remaining renovations as we grow. The State is an old building, approaching the 90 year mark in a few years, so there are repairs waiting to be made, which is a challenge that awaits us, but so many historical buildings nationwide have received the same treatment and are still shining to this day...that is our hope for the State.
Anderson has a well-known history of ups and downs as far as growth and revitalization are concerned, but with the addition of Oakley Brothers Distillery, Burro Loco, Buckskin Bikes, Kettle Top Brewhouse, among other upcoming ventures downtown (e.g. a new ""farm to table"" eatery), this new wave of businesses entering the city is actively demonstrating a trend toward the specific lifestyle culture that the State Theatre hopes to amplify through live shows and events.

Other Ways You Can Help

<h3>A History of Russian Hill Bookstore</h3>
<p>We began as Sunset Bookstore in 1974, a small used bookshop servicing the Sunset District west of 19th Avenue in San Francisco. Under the sole proprietorship of Carol Spencer, a second used bookshop was opened in the Russian Hill neighborhood in 1993, Russian Hill Bookstore.  Sunset bookstore has since closed, but the Russian Hill location endures.  We have been in continual operation for the past 43 years.</p>

Russian Hill Bookstore, with its general used books, new books in classics and best sellers, antiquarian and rare books, children's books and toys, the largest collection of note cards in the Bay Area, calendars, board games, journals, gift wrap, &amp;c., is the type of general store that meets the daily needs of the community, but which is quickly becoming extinct.</p>
<p>Bookstores have always been a part of the intellectual infrastructure of a community.  They are a community center and gathering place for its neighbors and tourists.  Every neighborhood should have at least one independent bookstore.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are inherent risks in any Small Business venture, especially with the closure of so many independent bookstores over the past few years  The sky rocketing rents and costs of doing business in San Francisco make it even more difficult for a bookstore to compete with retail chains and online behemoths.  However, we believe in the power of books and bookstores, and the support of our community.  Furthermore, we believe that books are making a comeback!</p>

We began as Sunset Bookstore in 1974, a small used bookshop servicing the Sunset District west of 19th Avenue in San Francisco. Under the sole proprietorship of Carol Spencer, a second used bookshop was opened in the Russian Hill neighborhood in 1993, Russian Hill Bookstore.  Sunset bookstore has since closed, but the Russian Hill location endures.  We have been in continual operation for the past 43 years.
Today, during this time of transition, we are asking for your assistance in helping Russian Hill Bookstore stay in the neighborhood for many more years to come!
What We Need & What You Get

We have set our fundraising goal at $50,000 to help cover renovations and necessary repairs in our new location, and moving expenses.  Any amount we can raise here will be so greatly appreciated!  We have put our entire life savings into this project in the hope that we can keep Russian Hill Bookstore open.  All of the funds raised here will go directly into the business, and will be of immeasurable benefit in helping us to begin this new chapter in the life of our bookshop.
The $50,000 we are seeking here will go toward renovating the new shop, tenant improvements, and moving expenses.

Removing floor mats and repairing/renovating floors
Replacing tinted store front windows and tinted glass entry doors with clear windows and doors
Installing anchors to secure our high bookshelves into the walls
Carpentry
Building new bookshelves and fixtures

<p>Long
awaited moment has finally arrived – you got driver's license! It took a
long road to get it. You put a lot of your time and effort to learn a much
needed everyday skill - ability to be able to drive a car.</p>
<p>Here you
are, confident and ready to start looking for your first car. After long
research, looking and reading about cars you finally settle for the one car of
your choice. You know you have to buy this one. Not everyone today
can afford to by a new car, so another option is to look at used car market.
You arrive at a dealership to look at your options and find your first car.
Does this situation sound familiar to you?</p>
<p><b><i>“My
grandfather drove this car to go grocery shopping on the weekend!”</i></b></p>
<p>Hooray! You
have been impressed with the condition and mileage of the car, and you become
its’ next owner. You are super excited about your newly purchased vehicle which
is in a good condition with lower than average cost and mileage. A month goes
by and all of a sudden your dream car begin to have problem after problem. You
cannot put two things together in your mind to understand – what has happened
to that great car of your dream? How could it start breaking all of a sudden?
The car was almost new and you barely drove it? Every visit to service department
is becoming a growing bill with more repairs to come for your ‘’dream’’ car.
List of work done on a car with low mileage in good condition does not make
sense any longer.</p>
<p>At that
moment you realize that you became the next victim of a dishonest seller
and that your dream turned into a nightmare for you - you have bought a car
with a rolled back mileage!</p>
<p>Many car
drivers have been faced with the same situation.</p>
<h1><i>About project</i></h1>
<p>This
project’s main goal is to resolve on going dilemma in the world of car sales
all around the globe. Mission
of our project is to create online resource with the introduction of a single
global car database. It will hold information from manufacturers, car dealers,
registration centers and monitor vehicles in service which in turn will be
logged into database system. Anyone from anywhere in the world, having a VIN
number will be able to check car’s history.</p>
<p>Our team has
already made an agreement with many car manufacturers and service centers to
participate in this joint effort.</p>
<p>Thanks to
this project rolling car’s mileage will have no sense and we will be
confident  when we are buying a used car - we will be sure in that we buy.</p>
<p>You can ask “<i>What is so special in this project? There
are a lot of online resources with same functionality!”</i> and partially you
will be right. Main difference is that our project will cover 95% of the
world’s second-hand car markets. There will be no difference where the car came
from – Germany, Russia, United States of America or any
other country. You will have all the information about the car you plan to buy.

<p></p><br/><p></p><h1><b>Предисловие</b></h1>
<p>Настал долгожданный момент - ты получил водительские
права! Ты долго к этому шел, приложил немало усилий и потратил много времени,
чтобы стать обладателем столь необходимого в нашей жизни навыка - умением
управлять автомобилем.</p>
<p>И вот ты, уверенный в собственных силах, начинаешь
подыскивать себе свою первую машину. Долго ходишь, присматриваешься, читаешь,
узнаешь и наконец выбрав то, что нравится, отправляешься покупать. Не каждый
сегодня может себе позволить новую машину, потому обращается к рынку
подержанных авто. И вот ты приезжаешь осматривать свой выбор, свой первый
автомобиль. Знакомая ситуация?</p>
<p><b>""На этой машине ездил мой дедушка по выходным, раз в
неделю, в магазин за продуктами!"" </b></p>
<p>Ура! Ты, впечатленный состоянием и пробегом авто,
становишься его следующим владельцем. Ты счастлив, ведь только что ты купил
машину в прекрасном состоянии за среднюю или даже низкую стоимость и с
небольшим пробегом. Проходит месяц и вдруг у с твоей машиной мечты начинаются
проблемы, одна за другой. Ты никак не можешь понять - в чем же дело, машина же
почти новая, совсем чуть-чуть проехала?! И каждые раз, обращаясь в сервис, тебе
называют огромные суммы за ремонт твоей ""мечты"" и список выполненных
работ совершенно не соответствует списку работ необходимых при твоем пробеге
авто.</p>
<p>В этот самый момент ты понимаешь, что стал очередной
жертвой нечестного продавца и что твоя мечта обернулась для тебя кошмаром - ты
купил машину со скрученным пробегом!</p>
<p>Многие из автомобилистов сталкивались с такой или очень
похожей ситуацией. </p>
<h1><b>О проекте</b></h1>
<p>Данный проект должен стать решением этой проблемы по всему
миру. Целью нашего проекта является создание онлайн ресурса с введением единой
мировой автомобильной базы данных. Информация полученная от производителей, дилерских
центров, центров регистрации и контроля автотранспорта а так же сервисных
центров будет заноситься в базу данных. Любой человек, из любой точки земного
шара, обладая VIN кодом, сможет проверить историю данного
автомобиля. Нашей команде уже удалось достигнуть соглашения о сотрудничестве
со многими авто производителями и центрами сервисного обслуживания. </p>
<p>Благодаря данному проекту скручивание пробега автомобиля
станет бессмысленным и при покупке подержанного автомобиля мы будем уверены в
том, что покупаем.</p>
<p>Вы спросите “Что в
вашем проекте такого особенного? На просторах интернета много подобных
проектов!<i>“</i> и в чем-то окажетесь правы. Главным отличием нашего проекта от
других является то, что он покроет 95% рынка подержанных автомобилей всего
мира. Не имеет значение откуда прибыл автомобиль – будь то Германия, Россия,
Соединенные Штаты Америки или любой другой страны. У вас всегда будет вся самая
подробная информация об автомобиле, который вы желаете приобрести.  </p>

Ура! Ты, впечатленный состоянием и пробегом авто,
становишься его следующим владельцем. Ты счастлив, ведь только что ты купил
машину в прекрасном состоянии за среднюю или даже низкую стоимость и с
небольшим пробегом. Проходит месяц и вдруг у с твоей машиной мечты начинаются
проблемы, одна за другой. Ты никак не можешь понять - в чем же дело, машина же
почти новая, совсем чуть-чуть проехала?! И каждые раз, обращаясь в сервис, тебе
называют огромные суммы за ремонт твоей ""мечты"" и список выполненных
работ совершенно не соответствует списку работ необходимых при твоем пробеге
авто.
В этот самый момент ты понимаешь, что стал очередной
жертвой нечестного продавца и что твоя мечта обернулась для тебя кошмаром - ты
купил машину со скрученным пробегом!
Многие из автомобилистов сталкивались с такой или очень
похожей ситуацией. 
О проекте
Данный проект должен стать решением этой проблемы по всему
миру. Целью нашего проекта является создание онлайн ресурса с введением единой
мировой автомобильной базы данных. Информация полученная от производителей, дилерских
центров, центров регистрации и контроля автотранспорта а так же сервисных
центров будет заноситься в базу данных. Любой человек, из любой точки земного
шара, обладая VIN кодом, сможет проверить историю данного
автомобиля. Нашей команде уже удалось достигнуть соглашения о сотрудничестве
со многими авто производителями и центрами сервисного обслуживания. 
Благодаря данному проекту скручивание пробега автомобиля
станет бессмысленным и при покупке подержанного автомобиля мы будем уверены в
том, что покупаем.
Вы спросите “Что в
вашем проекте такого особенного? На просторах интернета много подобных
проектов!“ и в чем-то окажетесь правы. Главным отличием нашего проекта от
других является то, что он покроет 95% рынка подержанных автомобилей всего
мира. Не имеет значение откуда прибыл автомобиль – будь то Германия, Россия,
Соединенные Штаты Америки или любой другой страны. У вас всегда будет вся самая
подробная информация об автомобиле, который вы желаете приобрести.  
Особенности проекта:


Подробная информация о транспортном средстве


Доступность из любой точки планеты


Доступность каждому человеку


Подлинная информация о пробеге только от достоверных
источников


Информативная защита от мошенников


Разработка проекта разделена на 3 этапа:


1-ый этап – Единая мировая база данных пробега авто(завершение
этапа – 1-ое Апреля 2016 года)


2-ой этап – Информация о происшествиях с авто и его повреждениях(завершение
этапа – 1-ое Августа 2016 года)


3-ий этап – Полная информация о техническом обслуживании
автомобиля(завершение этапа – 1-ое Февраля 2017 года)


Нам необходимо
Для реализации этого проекта необходимо 68,000EUR. Основная часть средств пойдет на
создание частной защищенной сети серверов – 39,800EUR. Для покрытия необходимых
туристических расходов, расходов связанных с переводом на все основные мировые
языки, а так же на другие, связанные с проектом, расходы  требуется 23,000EUR. Оставшиеся 5,200EUR будут потрачены на обслуживание и
поддержание проекта до 2018 года. Начиная с 2018 года поддержание и
обслуживание проекта будет производиться за счет средств, вырученных от размещения рекламы на вебсайте проекта. Наша команда вложит в создание проекта 8,000EUR из собственных средств. 
Поддержите нас
Мы будем очень рады любой поддержке с Вашей стороны.
Поддержав наш проект Вы не только поможете нам в его реализации, но и себе, а
так же многим людям во всем мире. Поддержите нас, расскажите друзьям и знакомым
и вместе мы сможем победить мошенничество с автомобильным пробегом.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div><h3><b>Short Summary</b></h3>
<p>In Denver alone, we estimate that there are <b>1,200 homeless
teenagers</b> ranging from ages 12-24. Purple Door Coffee is a non-profit coffee shop in
Denver, Colorado that hires and job-trains homeless youth and young adults who
want to leave street life behind. We have been open for over two years and have
hired and supported 11 brave people who wanted to leave homelessness forever. 5
of our employees have graduated our program and have moved onto jobs in the community
and there are 3 on track to graduate soon! </p>
<p>We have been honored to employ the individuals that we have,
but the need for employment with job and life skills for homeless teens is
great. As it is now, due to the small size of our cafe, we have only able to
employ 3 program employees at a time. Yet, there are many individuals
submitting applications and asking for life change. With
experience under our belts, we are ready to expand our business model and add a
coffee roaster to our portfolio. This alone will enable us to grow our program
employee size by more than double! </p>
<p>Donating to this campaign truly helps offer life change to
people who have been handed lives that are full of challenge, struggle and
pain. This roaster will offer hope not only for the lives of our
employees, but also the lives of their children and grandchildren. Donating to
this campaign offers change for generations to come!</p><p><br/></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To get this roaster started we need <b>at least $100,000!</b> We have never
in our history tried to raise this much money in such a short amount of time.
We are nervous, but very excited and hopeful. </p>
<p>Starting a roaster requires an investment up front. On its
own, a coffee roaster costs around $40,000. In addition to that, we need other items such as commercial grinders, scales, shelving, packaging for the
coffee, shipping materials, warehouse space for the roaster, construction costs
for the warehouse space and much more. $100,000 will allow us to have the things we need to start a small roastery. </p><p><b>Our ideal goal is $135,000</b>. Raising this money will allow us to purchase extra roasting equipment such as a coffee destoner, a coffee mixer, cupping materials and more. We will also be able to purchase a mail meter for mailing coffee, furniture for the warehouse, and stock up on supplies. </p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">If you give to this project you will get to taste the first
batches of coffee ever roasted by the Purple Door Coffee team! You can also
receive awesome rewards such as thank you notes from our employees, handmade
artisan coffee mugs and a tour of the roastery (once we are opened).</span></p><p><br/></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With the opening of the roaster, we will immediately be able
to offer 2 jobs (and life skills!) to individuals who want to leave
homelessness behind.  Once we have
established business for the  roaster, we
will be able to add even more. Our hope is to have 5 program employees working
at the roastery- which more than doubles the amount of jobs we can offer
annually!  </p>
<p>In addition to adding employees, a roaster will enable us to move towards becoming more
self-sustainable. Currently, Purple Door is supported by our in-store sales and
private donations, 65% to 35% respectively. With the roaster as a second stream of income, our business will see a greater shift in our
support and get us one step closer to functioning entirely on our own. </p><p><br/></p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>With the people we have employed, leaving street life is not
a simple one-time decision to make. Instead, it is a constant choice. A choice
to leave behind everything they have ever known as safe. A choice to leave
behind their only support system. And it is a choice to trust us at Purple Door
Coffee. </p>
<p>Here, we work to teach our employees how to hold a job and
work well. We teach coping skills and life skills. But, what is most meaningful
is the environment in which this learning takes place. With grace and patience
and compassion, we offer a  healthy and
loving support system. We offer a year of undivided attention and support to
each employee as they constantly choose to transition out of street-life. This
proves to be the most surprising and impacting thing for our employees - that
they have an encouraging and gracious support to lean on amidst much change. </p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Though it is hard, this work is worth it because the homeless teens we employ are worth it. And so is the life
change prompted by this project. It is our desire that the support offered
at Purple Door Coffee can create change for our employees and break cycles of
unhealthiness. This work: our time, energy and effort, can forever impact an entire family
for good- offering change from generations of homelessness and addiction to
generations of hard work and contribution.</span></p><p><br/></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We know that there are many folks out there who love what we
do, but can not give financially. That does not make your support any less
valuable! Sharing our story with friends and through social media is a huge way

<p>Pi Gwo Byen is a school on La Gonâve serving students aged 8-12 who have not had the opportunity to attend Haitian public schools due to family circumstances. Over a three-year period of instruction, the school takes children who have never sat in a classroom and prepares them for Haiti’s 6th Grade Exam, a standardized test of reading, writing, and arithmetic whose passage is a de facto requirement for most full-time jobs in Haiti. The national pass rate is well under 50%, yet Pi Gwo Byenconsistently achieves over 95%. This year, every student passed!</p>
<p>In return for a $300 donation to our campaign, we’ll provide a RE-VOLT system to the family of a Pi <span>GwoByen student, which will allow the student to do schoolwork at home at night, and we’ll waive the monthly RE-VOLT subscriber fee for the remainder of their studies at Pi GwoByen.

<p>RE-VOLT's seeds were planted in the aftermath of the January 2010 earthquake, when our co-founder and CEO, Maarten Boute, was two months into his tenure as CEO of Digicel Haiti, the country's preeminent mobile network operator. Digicel's cell towers withstood the earthquake and provided a critical piece of communications infrastructure for rescue and relief coordination. Several months after the quake, Digicel Group (a multinational telecoms provider and Digicel Haiti's corporate parent) decided to double-down on investing in its Haitian business, and its board encouraged Maarten to rapidly grow Digicel Haiti's subscriber base.</p>
<p>Under Maarten's leadership, Digicel Haiti grew from fewer than 2 million subscribers in 2010 to over 4.5 million in 2014. Maarten and RE-VOLT co-founder/COO Darragh Dolan, then Digicel Haiti's Head of Commercial Development, learned innumerable lessons along the way. Perhaps the most important was that new-user adoption of mobile phones is highly dependent upon affordable, reliable access to electricity. Customers who didn't have access to the power grid (80% of all Haitians and over 90% of rural Haitians) had to rely on pay-per-charge street electricity services, which cost 10-15% of an average family's daily budget. Digicel Haiti set up free charging stations to help reduce the impact of energy poverty on its subscribers, but these services proved especially hard to distribute in rural areas. For Maarten and Darragh, the idea of building a business that provides reliable, affordable, and clean energy to all Haitians began as an interesting side project and rapidly became a personal mission.</p>
<p>RE-VOLT began operating in early 2015 on the island of La Gonâve, one of the most isolated and underserved communities in Haiti. Once a rainforest-covered paradise affectionately known as the ""Vodou Island"", La Gonâve suffered massive deforestation in the mid-to-late 20th century, and currently supports itself mostly through fishing, subsistence farming, and remittences from abroad. Fewer than 5% of La Gonâve's residents have access to a small state-run power grid in the town of Anse-a-Galets, which provides 4 hours of power a day (6 to 10pm). A few of the wealthier residents have diesel generators, and fewer still have installed makeshift or kit-built solar energy systems. The vast majority of La Gonâve's residents light their homes at night with candles or kerosene lanterns and pay street vendors to charge their cell phones -- but we're starting to change that.</p>
<p>In under eight months of operation, RE-VOLT has created a measurable positive impact on La Gonâve; we're currently serving over 3,500 people every day. We've learned a tremendous amount from our customers already, and continue to make  iterative improvements to our marketing, sales, and service operations on a daily basis.</p>
<p>We're launching this Indiegogo campaign to raise working capital so that we can invest in our local sales and service staff and distribution infrastructure, which will allow us to serve more customers. We're targeting $50,000 because that's an amount we can put to immediate and effective use, and we believe that reaching this goal would allow us to scale our customer base to 2,000 households / 10,000 people by January 2016.</p>

<p>RE-VOLT's presence on the island of La Gonâve has already benefited the community in the following ways:</p> <ul> <li>
<b>Connectivity</b> - RE-VOLT systems come with a USB outlet that allows customer households to charge their cell phones 24/7. Haiti's GDP per capita is under $3/day (it's closer to $1/day in rural communities like La Gonâve), but that hasn't stopped the expansion of mobile networks; the number of active cell phones in Haiti exceeds 90% of its adult population. Without even taking into account the benefit of having light in the home, RE-VOLT systems provide significant cost savings to families that would otherwise be spending around $15/month to street vendors just to keep their phones charged.</li> <li>
<b>Education</b> - At night, Haitian families are often forced to share one or two weak light sources (such as candles); for a typical family of five or more people, this means that some children get access to light and some don't. Children who can't do their homework at night are at severe risk of non-advancement in Haiti's government-standardized school curriculum. Sadly, Haiti's energy poverty also impedes the advancement of women; in conditions of light-scarcity, male children are often given priority of access to lighting, resulting in higher dropout rates for girls. The high-efficiency LED room lights that come with the RE-VOLT system provide ample light for the entire family to do housework, homework or any other evening activity.</li>
</ul>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442850126/dlloakmocswvcz3peqi6.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>
<ul> <li>
<b>Safety</b> - the combustion-based indoor light sources currently used by most Haitian families, such as candles or kerosene lanterns, don't just weigh heavily on household budgets as an ongoing expense; they're also unsafe, because they produce toxic smoke and present a fire hazard. RE-VOLT customers no longer have to continually purchase dirty, dangerous energy sources in order to light their homes at night.</li>
<li>
<b>Jobs</b> - RE-VOLT has created good-paying, steady jobs on La Gonâve, and we intend to create many more as we continue to grow. We reach our customers through a robust on-the-ground marketing, sales, and service team staffed by La Gonâve locals; their knowledge of the community, personal relationships, and ability to elicit candid feedback have been instrumental to our success thus far. Furthermore, we have found that customers have used their RE-VOLT systems to improve their own incomes; for example, mechanics can work into the evening hours on high-priority jobs, and farmers who live far away from the nearest pay-to-charge station can not only save money, but also keep their cell phones on, allowing them to stay in closer contact with market vendors.</li>

<p>RE-VOLT currently offers customers a modified <a href=""http://www.dlight.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">d.light</a> D20 system which has been augmented with a GSM antenna, SIM card, and associated firmware, allowing RE-VOLT to remotely manage units.

<br/>
<p> Startups are inherently risky enterprises, especially when their target markets are in developing countries. The Haitian business climate presents a moderate degree of political risk, and RE-VOLT's margins are vulnerable to exchange rate fluctuations between the Haitian Gourde and the U.S. Dollar. We believe these risks are mitigated by the following factors:</p> <ul> <li>Our leadership team has an extensive track record of success growing businesses in developing markets, including (and most recently) our target market of Haiti.</li> <li>RE-VOLT provides a service that is transformational for our customers in ways that few others are; gaining access to reliable in-home electricity is, without exaggeration, a turning point in our customers' lives. As such, we are cautiously optimistic with regard to RE-VOLT's value proposition and our long-term ability to attract and retain customers.</li>
<li>State-sponsored rural electrification in Haiti is very limited and meaningful expansion in the short/medium-term is seen as highly unlikely. We therefore believe that there is a significant ""competitive moat"" around our business. To the extent that RE-VOLT is subject to direct competition, we believe that viable competitors would come in the form of similar off-grid, single-home services, and we believe that we are well-situated to compete within this market if others decide to enter it.</li>

Safety - the combustion-based indoor light sources currently used by most Haitian families, such as candles or kerosene lanterns, don't just weigh heavily on household budgets as an ongoing expense; they're also unsafe, because they produce toxic smoke and present a fire hazard. RE-VOLT customers no longer have to continually purchase dirty, dangerous energy sources in order to light their homes at night.

Jobs - RE-VOLT has created good-paying, steady jobs on La Gonâve, and we intend to create many more as we continue to grow. We reach our customers through a robust on-the-ground marketing, sales, and service team staffed by La Gonâve locals; their knowledge of the community, personal relationships, and ability to elicit candid feedback have been instrumental to our success thus far. Furthermore, we have found that customers have used their RE-VOLT systems to improve their own incomes; for example, mechanics can work into the evening hours on high-priority jobs, and farmers who live far away from the nearest pay-to-charge station can not only save money, but also keep their cell phones on, allowing them to stay in closer contact with market vendors.





RE-VOLT currently offers customers a modified d.light D20 system which has been augmented with a GSM antenna, SIM card, and associated firmware, allowing RE-VOLT to remotely manage units. Customers pre-pay for power usage in 7- or 30-day increments via the Mon Cash mobile banking platform, which is already a well-established service within Haiti.
The units' hardware consists of the following:



Solar panel


Home unit with battery, on/off switch, GSM antenna, and light / USB connections


3 high-efficiency LED lights; two ceiling-mounted with wall switches, and one which is detachable for use as a lantern

USB charging cable with extensions for all commonly used mobile phones (Nokia, Android, etc)

   












 Startups are inherently risky enterprises, especially when their target markets are in developing countries. The Haitian business climate presents a moderate degree of political risk, and RE-VOLT's margins are vulnerable to exchange rate fluctuations between the Haitian Gourde and the U.S. Dollar. We believe these risks are mitigated by the following factors:  Our leadership team has an extensive track record of success growing businesses in developing markets, including (and most recently) our target market of Haiti. RE-VOLT provides a service that is transformational for our customers in ways that few others are; gaining access to reliable in-home electricity is, without exaggeration, a turning point in our customers' lives. As such, we are cautiously optimistic with regard to RE-VOLT's value proposition and our long-term ability to attract and retain customers.
State-sponsored rural electrification in Haiti is very limited and meaningful expansion in the short/medium-term is seen as highly unlikely. We therefore believe that there is a significant ""competitive moat"" around our business. To the extent that RE-VOLT is subject to direct competition, we believe that viable competitors would come in the form of similar off-grid, single-home services, and we believe that we are well-situated to compete within this market if others decide to enter it.

 We are witnessing the suffering of fleeing men, women and children from the conflict in Syria, and we can no longer ignore it. The tipping point for me, and many others around the world, was the haunting photo of the boy on the beach. We should never have let this happen to him, his family or others in similar situations.
A few of my neighbours and I are getting together to help sponsor a family to start a new life in Oakville, Ontario, Canada. We ask for your help. To sponsor a family of four, we learned that we need to raise approximately 30,000.  
Of course, if we reach 60,000, we will be able to sponsor two families to come to live in Oakville area, Ontario.

<p>My name is <b>Marshall Hanbury Jr</b> and while working as a

became aware of the large circle of thinkers, educators and leaders that shape
the vibrant business, innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem of the
Charlottesville area. I was not only impressed by the magnitude of change that
they were inspiring in our world, both locally and globally, but I also really,
really wanted to chat with them and find out what really made them tick. That
is why, in June of 2015, I decided to start Conversion Factor. In that brief
time I have had the honor to talk with such business luminaries as <b>R. Edward

We are committed to obtaining the best bones, and with minimal processing ship them frozen fresh to our customers. By supporting us you are aiding in our initial setup so that we can offer you the top rate service you will come to love and expect from us.

Unlike other subscription services, ours is specifically geared toward the true consumer of our product: your dog. We are not pandering to the dog owner, we are giving a good dog a good bone. Simple as that. 
   What We Need & What You Get:
We are estimating that $2,000 will get our business going. The break down on the use of funds raised is as follows:


Freezer for storage of bones before shipping. $250 (found used on craigslist)

Packing materials/Shipping Supplies for safely shipping frozen bones. $300 (approx.)

Vacuum Sealer for preserving freshness from the farm to your dog's drooling mouth. $200 (approx.)

Scale and printer for ensuring full transparency between GDGB and our customers. You will sign up for a weight range based on the size of your dog. $400 (webstaurant.com)

Tools for cutting and cleaning up bones $250 (approx.)

Website and business startup Expenses- Owning our URL, the hosting of the subscription service, and the paperwork processing of starting a business adds up fast! We would like to to use Quickbooks, which will be critical in effectively organizing and running the company. Help us offset the cost of creating a business out of thin air and determination! $600 (approx.)

 We are excited to offer you perks in appreciation of your contributions:


We will be extending shout outs to contributors, thanking them and featuring their beautiful pets on our social media platforms.
We will be using this as an opportunity for people to sample our product before committing to our subscription service.
Larger contributions will unlock secret perks like free shipping on subscription service and more!

 All funds used will go towards the materials listed above. If we don't meet our goal, they are listed in order of priority for launching our business.    The Impact  Your contributions will help move a fledgling business into existence. All your support is appreciated. We are excited to get off the ground and make doggies and their owners happy! 
Good Dog Good Bone is run by Emily Crocetti, who is inspired by her love and gratitude for dogs. She hopes to adopt a canine companion in the very near future! GDGB is an idea for a simple service that is convenient and wholesome. Supporting us will be helping offer a great product to people who may not be able to make a trip up to a beef farm to buy bones regularly for their dog.    Challenges We have already done the research, filed the paperwork, and contacted our state's department of Agriculture Pet Feed department. We have the go-ahead to start sending our good bones to our customers! The biggest challenge is raising funds to get moving. With your help, we can be on the way to making tails wag and people smile.   Other Ways You Can Help If you can't contribute but would like to help us out, we thank you too!  
Make some noise! Share our indiegogo page on your social media platforms and help us gain traction.

<p>Hey everyone, like other kids on my childhood I love electronic gadgets and struggle to buy a new gadget from my savings, hate my life whenever the gadget becomes faulty, then I learned to fix it and had a dream of Inventing a gadget which last for 100 years.</p>
<p>Few years before I was able to understood the reason for less durability of devices and its source.</p>
<p>Do you know the devices which are completely powered by battery are more durable than one which are connected to electrical power grid ?</p>
<p>Yes stable and clean voltage triples the lifespan of all electrically powered device, using this information I made a research on traditional high voltage protection technology, finally discovered the core reason for less durability and reason for acceleration of e-waste generated globally.  </p>
<p><strong>Then I have Invented a novel device called e-Waste Buster, first version of it was tested and certified at IIT Madras, e-Waste Buster was selected as one best Innovation at UNIDO GCIP (Global Cleantech Innovation Programme).</strong></p>

High voltage event and neutral fault event are most common electrical line fault event, but the technology found in today electronics and electrical devices are more sophisticated than ever before and very sensible to this temporary over voltage and neutral fault event, so they get wear off and easily damaged by this events.

A Metal Oxide Varistor (MOV) is the key component used in almost all electronic & electrical devices to protect from high voltage fault condition, but traditional MOV  based high voltage protection technology are only capable of protecting from spike and it actually degrade and damage your devices on Temporary Over Voltage events, so it don't have a right technology to protect from Temporary Over Voltage event and provide incomplete protection.

So in traditional high voltage protection they use MOV with very low clamping voltage to decrease the damage and shutdown the system completely, this make the system unstable  the protected device becomes dead or e-waste soon.
Important thing to consider is this Temporary Over Voltage event is more frequently occurring event than spike, it the one which makes your smartest devices degrade and dead in short life!
So apart from obsolete technology more than 50 % of e-waste are created by traditional high voltage protection technology,  we are the first to address this hidden issue about e-waste and incompleteness in traditional high voltage protection technology.

Lindsey fell in love with the culture of West Africa and began building relationships with women in the fishing villages. She learned that when women don’t have jobs, it causes lasting effects on families and the entirety of the local economy. Lindsey became aware that 48 percent of youth in Ghana do not have access to jobs.</p>
<p>Lindsey knew she could not just vacation to Africa and never come back; she needed to be a part of the solution. As a result, she paired up with the CEO of Field Services Unlimited, Sue Shalley to create digital training and meaningful jobs for underemployed youth around the world.</p>
<p>Serendipitously, Lindsey met Vera Asuamuzuah in their international development masters program at Regis University and discovered that Vera was born and raised in Ghana and shared many of the same passions. Now Vera is on the ground in West Africa, as Anansi’s first trainer teaching young adults AutoCAD skills.</p>

<p>Through the use of high technology skills like AutoCAD, Revit, Quickbooks and more, youth will simultaneously be brought through basic entrepreneurship training to empower their ability to apply these skills in their communities.

<p>I have accomplished a multitude of facets in life thus far: two degrees, teaching English in Costa Rica, owning property, chairing committees, serving on a board, volunteering, maintaining a successful career and more.  But to date, the greatest accomplishment of all has been surviving the loss of my father to ALS.  The void I have from within, I fill with pursuing my passion to make him proud.  In the years I was blessed to have him, he instilled some amazing things in me; one being to become an entrepreneur and another being that the greatest thing you leave behind is your legacy.  </p>
<p>Therefore, the VISION, is to take my passion for cooking and leave an unforgettable legacy through Twisted Eggroll.  My choice of charity through this vision will be the ALS Association (<a href=""http://www.alsa.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.alsa.org/</a>)<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">.  I would be more than grateful for any donations to stand in agreement with this vision and to bless as many people as possible with these incredibly delicious eggrolls!</span></p>

In this world where so many entrees were just starting to get a little boring

what I needed to add another option to my food choices and pleasures.  I
must say that the cheese steak eggroll is my favorite dinner eggroll with the
apple cheesecake eggroll being my favorite dessert eggroll, although everything
I had so far has been so delicious.  Now, with that said, there are still
so many options of eggrolls on the menu that I have not experienced yet, and I

<p>“I recently came across Twisted
Eggroll at a family birthday party. 
Everyone was talking about the egg rolls. As I manned the grill I kept
seeing the trays of egg rolls disappear. 
I had someone quickly make me a plate and I asked that they put the egg
rolls on my plate first.  After I was
done grilling I ate my plate and quickly devoured the egg rolls.  I had to see what all the hub bub was
about.  I was not disappointed. I had the
pepperoni/sausage pizza egg roll first. 
I was surprised at the flavor and the fact that it was real pepperoni,
Italian sausage, and mozzarella cheese inside. 
I quickly devoured it and moved on to the second one, the philly cheese
steak.  As soon as I bit into it I went
back to get another.  This egg roll was
so good that I stole one off of my cousin’s plate.  I had three philly cheese steak rolls before
I touched anything else on my plate.  As
the young kids say nowadays “it was fye”. 
I live in Detroit and the next time I come back to Chicago I will be
ordering some Twisted Eggroll.  I can’t

    Risks & Challenges 


Generator Theft: Although this has been a trend, the vehicle will be well insured and will be stored in a secured location when not in use.  

Licenses & Permits:  By working with a great contractor, they will have all the necessary codes that need to be met in Chicago.  Starting off with a truck up to standard makes it an easier process to obtain licenses and permits.  Although, it will be a difficult process, being proactive with the right build will minimize the delay in licenses and permits.  
Health & Safety:  I have already passed my ServSafe Sanitation test and have my certification to work in the State of Illinois and the city of Chicago.  

Commercial Kitchen:  It is required for all food trucks to store, prepare, and cook food in a commissary or commercial kitchen although the options are limited which makes it difficult.  I have visited a few kitchens and have settled on using Kitchen Chicago (http://www.kitchenchicago.com).

<li>EXPERIENCES:  I have more than 10 years' experience serving senior citizens.  I have been a Caregiver, Certified Home Health Aide, and as the Senior Socialization and Wellness Coordinator for the John H. Boner Community Center in Indianapolis, IN.</li>
<li>PROGRAMS &amp; ACTIVITIES:  Over this time, I planned implemented preventive and health promotion activities and programs designed to meet the needs of senior citizens, to enhance their functional abilities and self-esteem; also I facilitated the <em>The Seven Dimensions of Wellness programs <em>at 11 other senior community centers in Indianapolis.  </em></em>
</li>
</ul><p><br/></p><p><strong>Ricks and Challenges</strong><strike><br/></strike></p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>The quote from the film <em><em>My Date With Drew</em>, ""If you don't take risk, you'll have a wasted soul.""  It is worth taking the risk to begin my journey!</em></p><ul>
<li>PROVIDE A HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT:  We will exercise a sick policy for our clients and staff due to illiness.  Failure to have a proactive policy against contagious diseases and illness may cause caregivers to perceive that our policies fail to minimize risk, and we can lose customers.</li>
<li>OPEN COMMUNICATION AND TRUST:  Caregivers need to trust in the safety  of their loved ones under the care of MBS Connection Elder Day Services.  For this reason, we will keep a line of open communication with caregivers, and be open and honest with families about disruptions and concerning situations.  Our staff will be trained in a way that will establish a strong relationship with families. </li>
<li>ENVIRONMENT SAFETY:  We will always have insurance coverage, but above all, we'll be aware of the environment our elders will be in and take as much precaution with each individual safety.  This will prevent or limit an unsafe environment and  risk of a lawsuit.</li>
<li>PROPER LICENSING:  MBS Connection Elder Day Services will have proper certification or licensing in place before opening for services.  Failure to comply with FSSA and IAADS presents the risk of fines or having our business shut down.</li>
<li>LOSS OF INCOME:  It is important for services and the welfare of our program that we have a payment plan policy  included in our application package.  Customers will be responsible to pay for the services even when absent on required dates of service requested of the customers.  Customers often move away, loved ones health decline, or financial situations change they may mean losing business without notice.  There isn't much we can do about this risk, but plan fundraising events.</li>
<li>A plan is in place to tract our prospective customers/clients:  Our plan for December 19, 2015 is to host a ""Silver Citizens Comedy Social Matinee"" event for Caregivers and their elderly loved ones to enjoy a day of fun and laughter (for approximately 100 participants).</li>
<li>We will plan at this event to do a focus group survey, designed for caregivers and their elderly loved ones to share their perceptions of adult day services.  We will  provide pre-registration enrollment.</li>
<li>RAISING FUNDS:  Establish donor relationships may or may not be a challenge.  While employed at The John H. Boner Community Center, I cultivated donor relationships and raised more than $10,000 in funds and in-kind donations from businesses that supported our successful and profitable events and seminars for approximately 175 to 200 senior citizens (such as Mind Body Soul Conference in 2012 &amp; 2014, and Bone &amp; Joint Health Awareness Seminar in 2013). </li>
<li>INSUFFICENT EMPLOYEES:  We will conduct our business in compliance with all applicable FSSA and IAADS laws, rules and regulations for staff-to-adult ratio.</li>
<li>Our staff will be mandated to report adult abuse that may occur from staff, caregivers and/or guardians.  This means that any suspected incidences of abuse inside or outside our care must be reported and fully documented to the proper agencies.  </li>
</ul><p><br/></p><p><strong>Other Ways To Contribute And Help To Make A Difference</strong></p><p>We realize that some people have the heart to give, but may not have the means to contribute at this time, however, ""You can help;"" we need you to get the word out about our Indiegogo Campaign.</p><p>We thank you and greatly appreciate your donations of any amount.<br/></p><p>We have been completely self-funded with community support.  We greatly appreciate the support received from the following organizations from the beginning of our business ideas up to our Indiegogo Campaign:</p><ul>

EDUCATION & RESOURCES:  In addition, we are committed to educate and provide resources to address caregiving and health issues for caregivers and the community.
STAY CONNECTED:  We will strive to keep elderly loved ones at home and active in the community for a longer period of time and delay institutionalization. 
QUALIFICATION:  The highlights of my qualifications include a Master's Degree in Gerontology from Ball State University.
EXPERIENCES:  I have more than 10 years' experience serving senior citizens.  I have been a Caregiver, Certified Home Health Aide, and as the Senior Socialization and Wellness Coordinator for the John H. Boner Community Center in Indianapolis, IN.
PROGRAMS & ACTIVITIES:  Over this time, I planned implemented preventive and health promotion activities and programs designed to meet the needs of senior citizens, to enhance their functional abilities and self-esteem; also I facilitated the The Seven Dimensions of Wellness programs at 11 other senior community centers in Indianapolis.  

Ricks and Challenges


The quote from the film My Date With Drew, ""If you don't take risk, you'll have a wasted soul.""  It is worth taking the risk to begin my journey!
PROVIDE A HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT:  We will exercise a sick policy for our clients and staff due to illiness.  Failure to have a proactive policy against contagious diseases and illness may cause caregivers to perceive that our policies fail to minimize risk, and we can lose customers.
OPEN COMMUNICATION AND TRUST:  Caregivers need to trust in the safety  of their loved ones under the care of MBS Connection Elder Day Services.  For this reason, we will keep a line of open communication with caregivers, and be open and honest with families about disruptions and concerning situations.  Our staff will be trained in a way that will establish a strong relationship with families. 
ENVIRONMENT SAFETY:  We will always have insurance coverage, but above all, we'll be aware of the environment our elders will be in and take as much precaution with each individual safety.  This will prevent or limit an unsafe environment and  risk of a lawsuit.
PROPER LICENSING:  MBS Connection Elder Day Services will have proper certification or licensing in place before opening for services.  Failure to comply with FSSA and IAADS presents the risk of fines or having our business shut down.
LOSS OF INCOME:  It is important for services and the welfare of our program that we have a payment plan policy  included in our application package.  Customers will be responsible to pay for the services even when absent on required dates of service requested of the customers.  Customers often move away, loved ones health decline, or financial situations change they may mean losing business without notice.  There isn't much we can do about this risk, but plan fundraising events.
A plan is in place to tract our prospective customers/clients:  Our plan for December 19, 2015 is to host a ""Silver Citizens Comedy Social Matinee"" event for Caregivers and their elderly loved ones to enjoy a day of fun and laughter (for approximately 100 participants).
We will plan at this event to do a focus group survey, designed for caregivers and their elderly loved ones to share their perceptions of adult day services.  We will  provide pre-registration enrollment.
RAISING FUNDS:  Establish donor relationships may or may not be a challenge.  While employed at The John H. Boner Community Center, I cultivated donor relationships and raised more than $10,000 in funds and in-kind donations from businesses that supported our successful and profitable events and seminars for approximately 175 to 200 senior citizens (such as Mind Body Soul Conference in 2012 & 2014, and Bone & Joint Health Awareness Seminar in 2013). 
INSUFFICENT EMPLOYEES:  We will conduct our business in compliance with all applicable FSSA and IAADS laws, rules and regulations for staff-to-adult ratio.
Our staff will be mandated to report adult abuse that may occur from staff, caregivers and/or guardians.  This means that any suspected incidences of abuse inside or outside our care must be reported and fully documented to the proper agencies.

Our Goal: To construct a wardrobe using locally sourced fiber, labor and dyes.

Why is local fashion essential?
 Cuts down on pollution, big time. The fast-fashion industry is one of the worst polluters of our world, our waterways, and our air quality. There are better ways to produce clothing and textiles that can and should last a lifetime. Supports the local economy by building demand for fiber, production, artisans, dyers, weavers, and consumers of local, ethical fashion. 
It feels great to wear something that was organically grown close to home, to know the name of the animal whose fiber was used in the production of the garment, and to be able to wear again and again something that was well made out of quality material that won't need to be replaced after a couple washings.   

A bit about me: I'm Diana, a fiber hyper-enthusiast who is just as passionate about the animals who provide us with the material we need to clothe our bodies. And, fashion. I have a background in costume production and clothing design. I am obsessed with fashion, clothes, and animals. I believe that I can marry these passions to make a statement that, in turn, will benefit my local community.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>Short Summary</h3> <p></p>
<p>Growing up, I always had a love for animals. My passion for training dogs was unknown until I rescued our labrador-husky mix, Luna. Luna had a variety of behavioral problems, including destructive behavior, separation anxiety, lack of potty training, dominance, and mouthing. I found joy in correcting these behaviors and helping her (and our family) find peace and happiness.</p>
<p>I have always wanted to have a positive impact on the life of other animals and their families, so I left a stable corporate job in order to make my mission come to life. Over a period of time, I began sharpening my training skills.</p>
<p>I am now in a position to start my own business. I recently founded One Love Dog Training, which I hope will bring other dogs and their owners the satisfaction that I have found in the loving, educational relationship with my dog.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>I am asking for $5,000 to assist with start-up fees (mainly training equipment). Allow me to break down the costs for you:<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>Training collars and leashes: I should be able to provide each client with a quality training collar and leash (sized appropriately). The sizes will range from XS-XL (5 total sizes) and will cost anywhere from $60-90 per dog. Each client will be able to keep this equipment so that they can practice skills at home.</li>
<li>Bite suit: The average quality bite suit costs $999. These are necessary for personal-protection training, and we will need more than one.</li>
<li>Personal training: I would like to receive additional training throughout the process, to further improve my skills and techniques.</li>
<li>Company expenses: Uniform shirts, business cards, branding, etc.</li>
</ul>
<div>As a donator, I would be more than happy to train your dog for free. If you'd like, I will also send you a branded company t-shirt!</div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Your donations will allow me to get this business up and running as soon as possible. I am fully committed to this venture and am confident that it will be nothing short of successful. There is a tremendous demand for these services in every area, particularly where I live in downtown Tampa. I am so grateful for any donation; it means a lot to me that there are people willing to help me make this dream come alive.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary 
Growing up, I always had a love for animals. My passion for training dogs was unknown until I rescued our labrador-husky mix, Luna. Luna had a variety of behavioral problems, including destructive behavior, separation anxiety, lack of potty training, dominance, and mouthing. I found joy in correcting these behaviors and helping her (and our family) find peace and happiness.
I have always wanted to have a positive impact on the life of other animals and their families, so I left a stable corporate job in order to make my mission come to life. Over a period of time, I began sharpening my training skills.
I am now in a position to start my own business. I recently founded One Love Dog Training, which I hope will bring other dogs and their owners the satisfaction that I have found in the loving, educational relationship with my dog.   What We Need & What You Get I am asking for $5,000 to assist with start-up fees (mainly training equipment). Allow me to break down the costs for you:

Training collars and leashes: I should be able to provide each client with a quality training collar and leash (sized appropriately). The sizes will range from XS-XL (5 total sizes) and will cost anywhere from $60-90 per dog. Each client will be able to keep this equipment so that they can practice skills at home.
Bite suit: The average quality bite suit costs $999. These are necessary for personal-protection training, and we will need more than one.
Personal training: I would like to receive additional training throughout the process, to further improve my skills and techniques.
Company expenses: Uniform shirts, business cards, branding, etc.

As a donator, I would be more than happy to train your dog for free. If you'd like, I will also send you a branded company t-shirt!
    The Impact Your donations will allow me to get this business up and running as soon as possible. I am fully committed to this venture and am confident that it will be nothing short of successful. There is a tremendous demand for these services in every area, particularly where I live in downtown Tampa. I am so grateful for any donation; it means a lot to me that there are people willing to help me make this dream come alive.

<p>The goal is to establish a Filipino website capable of
reaching out those who need assistance and those who are willing to lend a
hand. It's a crowdfunding site (same as Indiegogo) where people needing help
and people wanting to help meet. </p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p>Pinoys (Filipinos) are born having that distinctive spirit
of communal unity (hence the reason the word Bayanihan was used). Our team may not have the
power to read other people's mind, but we are positive that most Filipinos want
this and most Filipinos need this.</p>
<ul>
<li>This campaign was not created for personal gain as we'll be jeopardizing our social integrity. Please keep in mind that whether we meet the target or not, Bayanihan Fund will go live.</li> <li>The community we planned to develop will not be used as an income generating machine. We are not putting up a 'business'. We intend to make a difference. </li> </ul> <p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;""><font color=""#E62E8A"">The Details</font></span><br/></p>
</div><div> <p>Funding this campaign is optional. What
we need from you is to have the mentality that there is a way out of your
problem and that you can be a solution to other people’s problem. As John Donne said <i>'No Man Is An Island'</i>.</p>
<p>This is more
of an awareness movement than a fundraising project. We want to impart the
message that anybody can touch someone else’s life if the tool is made available
to him. Whatever money we accumulate will give us the momentum in facing
the bigger challenge of accomplishing that tool, our objective.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Below are a few features we envision for Bayanihan Fund:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unique TLD (not the common .PH .COM or .COM.PH)
for it to stand out<br/>
</li>
<li>Neat, sleek, sophisticated, responsive design to
keep it attractive<br/>
</li>
<li>Strict security to protect the users and to
prevent abuse of the service<br/>
</li>
<li>Diverse local and international funding options which demonstrate our
flexibility <br/>
</li>
<li>Promos and contests to make it more interactive and
engaging to visitors<br/>
</li>
<li>Dedicated blog site for important updates</li>
<li>Forum discussion so you can exercise
your freedom of speech<br/>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3><font color=""#E62E8A"">The Impact</font></h3> <p></p>
<p>Think about this. At some point in your life, you've been in a situation almost similar to any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>need to buy a new pair of shoes</b></li>
<li><b>need to feed a beggar on the street</b></li>
<li><b>need to support a sick friend on his hospital bills</b></li>
<li><b>need to fund a genius invention</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Yet what you have in your pocket is just enough for you or your family to survive the day. You need money, so you turn to social media for help. People within your network were hit by their conscience and were pushed to act or do something about it. They eagerly shared your post ('cause that's all they can really do). You received thousands of likes, views, comments, etc. Days or weeks past, your wish is still a wish. Simply because the numbers you collected are not convertible to cash, that's the reality.</p>
<p>With Bayanihan Fund, things will change. You can create a campaign to raise fund coming from people you know and from kind-hearted strangers. You can check different projects to look for a cause you want to support. You can browse innovative ideas and talents from the Philippines. In addition, you can also meet individuals who share the same interests as yours.</p>

<p><b>Q: Are you competing with Indiegogo?</b></p>
<p><i>A: No. Indiegogo is one of the paramount in global crowdfunding. They are up there. Base upon our study, Filipino crowdfunding projects hosted on international websites get minimal exposure here in the Philippines thus only a few of them are hitting their target amount. And most of those who succeeded are Filipino campaigners living in other countries, they were backed by foreign entities. Our target market is mainly the local audience. We want to introduce crowdfunding in the Philippines and how our 'bayanihan' fits into the process.</i></p>
<p><b>Q: What makes you unique from other local crowdfunding websites?</b></p>
<p><i>A: Our coverage is way more comprehensive. We are not like thesparkproject.com (innovations), <i>philamthropy.com (talents/ideas), </i>artisteconnect.com (artists), proteesproject.com (shirts), or giftlauncher.com (gifts). Any project, campaign, or cause can be created in Bayanihan Fund. Maybe a tall order, but since we share the same goal, we want to work with the site owners above for the possibility of unifying us all.</i></p>
<p><b>Q: Some tried, some failed. Will you be next in line?</b></p>
<p><i>A: Definitely not. Defunct sites like ibayanihan.com, ideacamp.ph, socialproject.ph, and getstarted.ph are our inspiration. We are passionate about this and we want to stay for good. We don't want to be tagged as 'just another' crowdfunding website so we are mindful of these common mistakes for startups:</i></p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li><i>Creating website for self-profit</i></li>
<li><i>Lack of technical skills and domain knowledge</i></li>
<li><i>Poor planning and implementation</i></li>
<li><i>Poor management </i></li>
<li><i>Poor marketing strategy</i></li>
</ol>
<p><b>Q: How do you intend to elude these mistakes you mentioned?</b></p>
<p><i>A: As stated earlier, we're not here to beef up our wallets. Our purpose is to help the Filipino masses. Most of our team members may not have the necessary expertise to build and maintain a crowdfunding website but all of us are willing to take essential trainings and expand our research if needed. If we have enough budget, we are open to tap equipped freelancers to assist us with the tasks and perhaps venture on paid advertising as well.</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>Q: Why aren't you using Philippine Peso currency in your campaign?</b></p>
<p><i>A: Indiegogo is not accepting Philippine Peso. <i>Banks and payment processors have their own exchange rates. T</i>o avoid any confusion due to inflation/deflation, we'll stick with the current exchange rate at the day of the campaign launch. We will only be using below conversion for transactions associated with this campaign. </i></p>

<p><b>Q: What do you think is the key to the success of Bayanihan Fund?</b></p>

The goal is to establish a Filipino website capable of
reaching out those who need assistance and those who are willing to lend a
hand. It's a crowdfunding site (same as Indiegogo) where people needing help
and people wanting to help meet. 

Pinoys (Filipinos) are born having that distinctive spirit
of communal unity (hence the reason the word Bayanihan was used). Our team may not have the
power to read other people's mind, but we are positive that most Filipinos want
this and most Filipinos need this.

This campaign was not created for personal gain as we'll be jeopardizing our social integrity. Please keep in mind that whether we meet the target or not, Bayanihan Fund will go live. The community we planned to develop will not be used as an income generating machine. We are not putting up a 'business'. We intend to make a difference.   The Details
 Funding this campaign is optional. What
we need from you is to have the mentality that there is a way out of your
problem and that you can be a solution to other people’s problem. As John Donne said 'No Man Is An Island'.
This is more
of an awareness movement than a fundraising project. We want to impart the
message that anybody can touch someone else’s life if the tool is made available
to him. Whatever money we accumulate will give us the momentum in facing
the bigger challenge of accomplishing that tool, our objective.

Below are a few features we envision for Bayanihan Fund:

Unique TLD (not the common .PH .COM or .COM.PH)
for it to stand out

Neat, sleek, sophisticated, responsive design to
keep it attractive

Strict security to protect the users and to
prevent abuse of the service

Diverse local and international funding options which demonstrate our
flexibility 

Promos and contests to make it more interactive and
engaging to visitors

Dedicated blog site for important updates
Forum discussion so you can exercise
your freedom of speech




Just so you know, we are in the process of building
our team. If your eyes got you on this section thus far, it probably means that
you are showing some interest in what we're trying to achieve. In case you
want to become one of us, kindly check the perks section on the right for details on how you
can join. We'll be more than happy to have you on board.
    The Impact 
Think about this. At some point in your life, you've been in a situation almost similar to any of the following:

need to buy a new pair of shoes
need to feed a beggar on the street
need to support a sick friend on his hospital bills
need to fund a genius invention

Yet what you have in your pocket is just enough for you or your family to survive the day. You need money, so you turn to social media for help. People within your network were hit by their conscience and were pushed to act or do something about it. They eagerly shared your post ('cause that's all they can really do). You received thousands of likes, views, comments, etc. Days or weeks past, your wish is still a wish. Simply because the numbers you collected are not convertible to cash, that's the reality.
With Bayanihan Fund, things will change. You can create a campaign to raise fund coming from people you know and from kind-hearted strangers. You can check different projects to look for a cause you want to support. You can browse innovative ideas and talents from the Philippines. In addition, you can also meet individuals who share the same interests as yours.
Q&A
 Q: What do I get out of this?
A: Campaigning for a drive that would revolutionize the Philippines' social networking may not be motivating enough. We are running these contests to make it more rewarding for our followers.
#bFUNd Top Contributors. The top 3 with the most personal contributions plus your referrals' contributions wins. To make sure your referral counts, please visit How To Participate In A Referral Contest. 
#bFUNd Campaign Video. The video with the most number of views wins. Here are the mechanics:


Take a selfie video and explain why are you supporting Bayanihan Fund. It doesn't matter whether you use Tagalog (local dialect) or English as long as it is catchy and convincing. (Length should not be greater than five minutes.)

Send your material through email.

We will post your video on our YouTube channel.

We will send you your URL link.

Start promoting your video. (Likewise, we will help you get exposure to all our social media accounts.)


#bFUNd Blogging. If you have strong appetite about writing, tell your readers about this campaign. The writer with the most referrals' contributions will be named as the blogger king.


#bFUNd Logo. Email as many entries as you like, however only one winner will be chosen. The following are the requirements:



Includes the words Bayanihan Fund

Has patriotism or bayanihan theme
Accepted formats are PSD, EPS, JPG, GIF, PNG, TIF
Must be available in two sizes



#bFUNd One-page Site. Create a Bayanihan Fund landing page hosted in any free webhosting platforms. Your page should have links to our campaign and to all our social media accounts (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Google+, Instagram). One winner will be declared.


All entries must be sent to bayanihan.fund@gmail.com. Successful participants will receive a brand new smart phone, Bayanihan Fund T-shirt, and special invitation to join our development team (if you are residing outside of the Philippines, we'll work out a different prize for you). Winners will be announced days after the end of the campaign. 



Q: Are you competing with Indiegogo?
A: No. Indiegogo is one of the paramount in global crowdfunding. They are up there. Base upon our study, Filipino crowdfunding projects hosted on international websites get minimal exposure here in the Philippines thus only a few of them are hitting their target amount. And most of those who succeeded are Filipino campaigners living in other countries, they were backed by foreign entities. Our target market is mainly the local audience. We want to introduce crowdfunding in the Philippines and how our 'bayanihan' fits into the process.
Q: What makes you unique from other local crowdfunding websites?
A: Our coverage is way more comprehensive. We are not like thesparkproject.com (innovations), philamthropy.com (talents/ideas), artisteconnect.com (artists), proteesproject.com (shirts), or giftlauncher.com (gifts). Any project, campaign, or cause can be created in Bayanihan Fund. Maybe a tall order, but since we share the same goal, we want to work with the site owners above for the possibility of unifying us all.
Q: Some tried, some failed. Will you be next in line?
A: Definitely not. Defunct sites like ibayanihan.com, ideacamp.ph, socialproject.ph, and getstarted.ph are our inspiration. We are passionate about this and we want to stay for good. We don't want to be tagged as 'just another' crowdfunding website so we are mindful of these common mistakes for startups:


Creating website for self-profit
Lack of technical skills and domain knowledge
Poor planning and implementation
Poor management 
Poor marketing strategy

Q: How do you intend to elude these mistakes you mentioned?
A: As stated earlier, we're not here to beef up our wallets. Our purpose is to help the Filipino masses. Most of our team members may not have the necessary expertise to build and maintain a crowdfunding website but all of us are willing to take essential trainings and expand our research if needed. If we have enough budget, we are open to tap equipped freelancers to assist us with the tasks and perhaps venture on paid advertising as well.


Q: Why aren't you using Philippine Peso currency in your campaign?
A: Indiegogo is not accepting Philippine Peso. Banks and payment processors have their own exchange rates. To avoid any confusion due to inflation/deflation, we'll stick with the current exchange rate at the day of the campaign launch. We will only be using below conversion for transactions associated with this campaign. 



Q: What do you think is the key to the success of Bayanihan Fund?
A: The short answer is YOU. Whatever action you decided to take after reading this article will have a direct impact on us. You will define our failure. Our triumph depends on you. 
It all starts here in Indiegogo. Crowdfunding relies heavily on the network you build, the crowd you pulled together. The volume of support, resources, and awareness we gathered after the conclusion of the campaign will carry over to the formation of Bayanihan Fund.   Other Ways You Can Help
Though Philippines has a bloated population, the majority of its citizens does not have a credit card (or shall we say Pinoys are avoiding credit cards due to the temptation they bring). If you belong to the majority but you want to fund the campaign, your alternative is a prepaid debit card. This is being offered in almost all local banks. You can acquire one for as low as P350 from BPI. If you feel this is still a hefty price, you can own a budget debit card from Smart Money for only P100 (less than $3).
It's understandable that some people just can't
contribute, but that doesn’t mean they cannot help at all. You can use the magic of any of
your social media accounts in broadcasting this campaign #bFUNd. In this era where
social media reigns, it has been proven that a single click on that Like/Share
button could go as far as being a global trend. Who knows, you might be using Bayanihan Fund in the near
future (we can’t imagine how proud that feeling is from your end).
This is a project that will benefit our fellow kababayans
(Filipinos). We hope you will do your part in making it possible.
Make a noise, make it loud. Spread #bFUNd like wildfire.

<p></p>
<p>
</p><p><b></b></p><p></p><p>With your support ComChange will connect
communities in the developing world. 
ComChange will use a unique web platform as a catalyst to promote
dialogue, exchange of information, and sharing of what practices work and what
practices do not work.  ComChange will
promote innovative practices that emerge and mobilize resources to help develop
and replicate these practices.</p>
<p>With the US$2,500 we have already raised
through this crowd funding campaign we will complete the development of our
website.  But that is just the
beginning.  Some concrete ways your
generous contributions will be put to work include:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>$2,800 will support a Correspondent
for one year who will be responsible for reporting on stories that are changing
lives and empowering communities in South Africa, Ethiopia, Bolivia, Ghana and
other countries</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>$1,500 will support one person as
part of a team that will visit communities in nearby countries to learn and
share innovative practices for changing lives </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>$1,000 will fund the
investigation and preparation of a 3-part story on how lives are being
transformed and communities are gaining power over their affairs – the Maya
community in Belize; or communities in the arid zones of north-east Brazil; or
the education and empowerment of poor children and their parents in Kenya; or a
community, particularly youth, using bamboo and modern technology to rise out
of poverty and build a self-managed community economy in rural Jamaica.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>$4,000 will fund the investigation
and writing of a multi part series on how communities have been working with
local governments to set priorities and build consensus on budget for
development.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>$600 will support for one year a
stay-at-home mom or one youth, as part of a cluster or co-op, to build and
start operating a tropical shade house of hydroponically / naturally grown
vegetables. With rapidly increasing demand for healthy food, shade house
farmers decrease their food costs, improve their health, and make a living
income thus transforming their lives.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>$500 will allow us to promote
our work and the ComChange website to NGOs, community
groups/associations/co-ops, institutions, local governments and others in a
country</p>
<h3><u><b>Why
ComChange?                                                              </b></u></h3>
<p>In the developed world communication is an
expected part of daily life.  It is
mostly seamless, organized, and constant. 
In the developing world it is not. 
There have been issues with technology, priorities, capacity and a less
than inherent culture of sharing knowledge. 
However, that is changing.  There
is now a desire by communities to communicate, collaborate, and connect with
their peers.  As the founder of ComChange
says:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;""><i>“One of the images that has remained with me is the
eagerness of people in communities, associations</i><i>,</i><i> and local
governments in Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, Central America and elsewhere, to
learn more about how others solve similar problems as their own. One of their
frequent questions is how do others gain influence with institutions and
governments</i><i>?</i><i>”</i></span><i><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">  </span> -  <b>Franklyn Harvey, Founder, ComChange</b></i>
</blockquote><blockquote> <span style=""font-weight: normal;""><i><span>“</span></i><i>I aim to help empower
children of teenage mothers from the slums of Nairibi by offering a day-school,
jobs to their mothers and skills for entrepreneurship. ComChange could not come
at a better time. It would help make the world see what we are doing in these
slums, connect with us and support the change we seek.</i><i>”</i></span><i><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> </span>- </i><b>Elizabeth

<i>”</i><i>COEP</i><i> is looking forward to
working with ComChange on its new web platform. It will be an opportunity to

<h3><b><u>How does it Work?                                                             </u></b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>ComChange has begun to create a network of Country Correspondents
across the Global South - Africa, Central and South America, the Caribbean, and
Asia-Pacific. These Correspondents will work directly with, or themselves part
of, grassroots communities to hear and prepare their stories and collect
information for the web platform. They will also act as the contact point in
their countries for ComChange.</p>
<p>We will also develop Key Contacts and partnerships with various
organizations such as COEP in Brazil and the Caribbean Association of Small and
Medium Enterprise (CASME) in the Caribbean. We expect that many groups and
individuals from both southern and northern countries will contribute
information and stories.</p>
<p>At the central operations hub, we have selected a capable and
experienced team of editors, web platform developers, development practitioners
and management personnel to co-ordinate the virtual operations of ComChange.</p>

Communities Making Change Happen


With your support ComChange will connect
communities in the developing world. 
ComChange will use a unique web platform as a catalyst to promote
dialogue, exchange of information, and sharing of what practices work and what
practices do not work.  ComChange will
promote innovative practices that emerge and mobilize resources to help develop
and replicate these practices.
With the US$2,500 we have already raised
through this crowd funding campaign we will complete the development of our
website.  But that is just the
beginning.  Some concrete ways your
generous contributions will be put to work include:
· 
$2,800 will support a Correspondent
for one year who will be responsible for reporting on stories that are changing
lives and empowering communities in South Africa, Ethiopia, Bolivia, Ghana and
other countries
· 
$1,500 will support one person as
part of a team that will visit communities in nearby countries to learn and
share innovative practices for changing lives 
· 
$1,000 will fund the
investigation and preparation of a 3-part story on how lives are being
transformed and communities are gaining power over their affairs – the Maya
community in Belize; or communities in the arid zones of north-east Brazil; or
the education and empowerment of poor children and their parents in Kenya; or a
community, particularly youth, using bamboo and modern technology to rise out
of poverty and build a self-managed community economy in rural Jamaica.
· 
$4,000 will fund the investigation
and writing of a multi part series on how communities have been working with
local governments to set priorities and build consensus on budget for
development.
· 
$600 will support for one year a
stay-at-home mom or one youth, as part of a cluster or co-op, to build and
start operating a tropical shade house of hydroponically / naturally grown
vegetables. With rapidly increasing demand for healthy food, shade house
farmers decrease their food costs, improve their health, and make a living
income thus transforming their lives.
· 
$500 will allow us to promote
our work and the ComChange website to NGOs, community
groups/associations/co-ops, institutions, local governments and others in a
country
Why
ComChange?                                                              
In the developed world communication is an
expected part of daily life.  It is
mostly seamless, organized, and constant. 
In the developing world it is not. 
There have been issues with technology, priorities, capacity and a less
than inherent culture of sharing knowledge. 
However, that is changing.  There
is now a desire by communities to communicate, collaborate, and connect with
their peers.  As the founder of ComChange
says:



“One of the images that has remained with me is the
eagerness of people in communities, associations, and local
governments in Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, Central America and elsewhere, to
learn more about how others solve similar problems as their own. One of their
frequent questions is how do others gain influence with institutions and
governments?”   -  Franklyn Harvey, Founder, ComChange
 “I aim to help empower
children of teenage mothers from the slums of Nairibi by offering a day-school,
jobs to their mothers and skills for entrepreneurship. ComChange could not come
at a better time. It would help make the world see what we are doing in these
slums, connect with us and support the change we seek.” - Elizabeth
Ochieng, Founder, Kawangware Kids and Women Empowerment Centre, Nairobi, Kenya,
Africa
 
”COEP is looking forward to
working with ComChange on its new web platform. It will be an opportunity to
exchange our experiences developed over the last 20 years working with
organizations and people that are building communities and transforming lives
with a paradigm that is more fair and collaborative. We will be sharing
practices and knowledge leading to community empowerment.”
 - Andre Spitz, Executive Director, COEP, Brazil





What is ComChange?                                                        

ComChange has four components:
COMMUNITY HUB
The Community Hub is an online network that
provides grassroots communities with the tools they need to engage in dialogue,
build solid connections and exchange knowledge and innovative practices. 
The Hub will provide news, stories, developments
and other information from grassroots communities. It will include a
Marketplace to find assistance and order community-made products, a photo and
video library and a directory of community organizations. Radio and TV will also
be developed for the Hub.
E-PUBLICATIONS
ComChange will provide three original e-publications sent directly to
your inbox:
· 
A regular original
E-Magazine covering a range of special stories, innovations, networks and
community empowerment experiences from the Global South
· 
An original
E-Newsletter with popular analysis of grassroots actions and innovative
developments in a specific country or region of the world, or in a particular
area of community action (e.g. food security, response to climate change, education,
local governance, etc)
· 
E-Bulletins and
E-Reports uncovering the voices of grassroots communities on issues that are
gaining wide coverage in the established media but neglect the views of
communities 


DIRECT ASSISTANCE TO COMMUNITIES
As ComChange grows, it will provide resources – technical assistance as
well as fundraising opportunities and financial support – to local grassroots
communities in the Global South. The resources will assist to develop and
replicate innovative initiatives to transform lives and empower communities to
bring about change.
FACE-TO-FACE GATHERINGS

ComChange will sponsor and
host a series of face-to-face networking events and gatherings that will link
grassroots communities with each other in a region or sub-region of the world. 

Our Partners in Action

At the central operations hub, we have selected a capable and
experienced team of editors, web platform developers, development practitioners
and management personnel to co-ordinate the virtual operations of ComChange.


 
“CASME is an association of small business
associations in the Caribbean region. We are looking to ComChange, as a
like-minded partner, to help strengthen the micro, small and medium enterprise
(MSME) sector and communities in general. ComChange will provide game changing
opportunities for knowledge exchange, networking and transformative development.”  -  Edward Chin-Mook, President, CASME
