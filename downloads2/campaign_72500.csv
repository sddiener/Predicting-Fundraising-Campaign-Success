Who We Are

Purposeful Design is a not-for-profit wood shop specializing in handmade furniture made from rough cut, Indiana hardwoods. We are located on the near east side of Indianapolis in a renovated church building. 


We employ men in our city who’ve hit rock bottom and who have been without a home or unable to get or keep a steady job. We help rebuild lives while teaching the craft of woodworking through positive and encouraging mentoring. We are passionate about both building furniture and re-building lives.

However, we are not...
A job preparedness or training enterprise – we actually make jobs.We are not for everyone – the men must be trainable and show up – not on drugs or alcohol, although nearly all recently were struggling.

The Dual Mission Strategy

Through several local strategic partners we are able to outfit our wood shop with the finest Indiana hardwoods around. This allows our products to remain one-of-a-kind while also keeping costs low for our customers.

We design and build a variety of furniture, each handmade by our craftsmen. Much like the wood we use, each piece of furniture is custom made, and offers a unique story of restoration. Here's what Purposeful Design's employees have to say:
“I was in such a dark place. I was delivered from that and now I’m making things people can enjoy…it’s pretty awesome.”
“I love to get up and come to work every day.”
“My family loves what’s happening with me. Purposeful Design definitely has been a big part of that. Jesus saved my life and if it wasn’t for Him I would probably still be dead like I was before.”

<h3> Service will be held once a week on Friday nights for up to 20 diners. It will be a set menu, 4 course meal with set donation and gratuity not required. Our menu and donation request will be released via our social media site and donor email list Monday mornings. Invitations can be requested through the same platform. Public invitations will be sent Wednesday morning for Friday service at 7pm. </h3>
<h3> It is important for us to provide fresh, local, native produce and grains. Locally and humanely raised proteins will be a focus as well. The way we utilize dining out currently is invasive to our environment and cannot sustain itself with ethical practices.  Along with local and seasonal foods and preserves, we would like to provide a sense of ownership and pride in the way you dine out. Providing an education in how your food is produced and prepared in an intimate and casual family style setting.</h3>

<h3> Donors will help me achieve my lifelong desire to operate my own dining establishment. Instead of the "" Go Big or Go Home"" attitude most first time restauranteurs have, I am making small attainable benchmarks. This being the first. The eventual goal for NKSC, is Maine's first agricultural center and ecological retreat that is fully self sustaining with a restaurant. Think Blue Hill at Stone Barns, but smaller scale, and actually approachable to the average Maine residents wallet.</h3>

<h3> I have figured in the fees associated with using the Indiegogo platform with my goal of $3,000. for the final amount of $3,150. This will provide the ability to finish the dining area for 20, a large two sided room with an open fireplace on both sides. It will also make it possible for us to finish crafting our family style slab tables. Acquire service and flatware for 20. As well as staff and complete our first dinner, a soft launch and perk for our Family tier of donors. This will provide a more intimate dinner  to get to know your chef, farmer and other NKSC Family members. The other perks for the NKSC Family donors is the right of first refusal on all NKSC events, and the menu pre-release a day prior to public publishing. </h3>
<h3> The second tier, Friends of NKSC will get the pre-released menu and right of second refusal on all NKSC events. Other NKSC events will include food retreat weekends, smaller sized picnics atop Lovers Leap and NKSC educational and harvest events. Regardless of the eventual amount raised, it will all go to launching NKSC in November 2015. The more I raise the sooner it happens and the higher quality the immediate experience will be.

</div></div>","Hi there. My name is Kathryn and I'm a Chef, Food Sales Rep and Menu Consultant from Bangor, Maine. I have held every job you can imagine in the restaurant world starting at age 14. I am self taught and self motivated. My most notable positions have been as an Independent Caterer, Pastry Chef, Sous Chef and Pit Boss at a BBQ Restaurant.
 





 My campaign is to launch Bangor's  first chef run supper club. The New Kenduskeag Supper Club will be held once a week near downtown Bangor. The venue will be our 1890's farmhouse we are historically renovating overlooking the Kenduskeag Stream from Lovers Leap. An idyllic setting for fine dining. 




 Food for the NKSC will be provided from our urban gardens on site, our permaculture garden in Northern Maine or from local farmers. Our plan is to only outsource what cannot be grown in Maine (avocado, chocolate, citrus, ect.). We will also focus on native foods frequently.
 





 Service will be held once a week on Friday nights for up to 20 diners. It will be a set menu, 4 course meal with set donation and gratuity not required. Our menu and donation request will be released via our social media site and donor email list Monday mornings. Invitations can be requested through the same platform. Public invitations will be sent Wednesday morning for Friday service at 7pm. 
 It is important for us to provide fresh, local, native produce and grains. Locally and humanely raised proteins will be a focus as well. The way we utilize dining out currently is invasive to our environment and cannot sustain itself with ethical practices.  Along with local and seasonal foods and preserves, we would like to provide a sense of ownership and pride in the way you dine out. Providing an education in how your food is produced and prepared in an intimate and casual family style setting.
 







 Donors will help me achieve my lifelong desire to operate my own dining establishment. Instead of the "" Go Big or Go Home"" attitude most first time restauranteurs have, I am making small attainable benchmarks. This being the first. The eventual goal for NKSC, is Maine's first agricultural center and ecological retreat that is fully self sustaining with a restaurant. Think Blue Hill at Stone Barns, but smaller scale, and actually approachable to the average Maine residents wallet.
 



 I have figured in the fees associated with using the Indiegogo platform with my goal of $3,000. for the final amount of $3,150. This will provide the ability to finish the dining area for 20, a large two sided room with an open fireplace on both sides. It will also make it possible for us to finish crafting our family style slab tables. Acquire service and flatware for 20. As well as staff and complete our first dinner, a soft launch and perk for our Family tier of donors. This will provide a more intimate dinner  to get to know your chef, farmer and other NKSC Family members. The other perks for the NKSC Family donors is the right of first refusal on all NKSC events, and the menu pre-release a day prior to public publishing. 
 The second tier, Friends of NKSC will get the pre-released menu and right of second refusal on all NKSC events. Other NKSC events will include food retreat weekends, smaller sized picnics atop Lovers Leap and NKSC educational and harvest events. Regardless of the eventual amount raised, it will all go to launching NKSC in November 2015. The more I raise the sooner it happens and the higher quality the immediate experience will be. No matter how much, NKSC will launch.
 

 It is important to all to approach dining out in a more ethical, sustainable and more personal manner. This is my way of fulfilling a dream and helping the Maine farming community by dining better and truly respecting where our food comes from. As a native Maine chef and farmer with a native master gardner and farmer as a partner, our goals and missions are ones we are qualified for. We are very driven to complete this goal, no matter the personal demand. Thank you for your time, consideration and support. Every dollar helps. The recipe is here.

   Our Goals and Your Help
This summer the Strong Badger Coffeehouse was mobile. I wheeled a home-made cart around downtown Winnipeg selling iced coffees and teas, and chatting with people about my ideas. Though opening a storefront shop is a very different animal, I gained heaps of invaluable hands-on experience through my summertime venture.

When I was a little girl, I was introduced to Rock and Roll music at a very young age. Growing up, I wasn’t sure whether I wanted to follow my father's footsteps and pursue a career in the Music Industry or become a Beautician. I have since become a Hairstylist and Makeup Artist for a little over 5 years now. As soon as I graduated high school, I decided to enroll myself in Cosmetology School. I have worked for various different Salons in the past, and have learned a lot from each one. I still have a complete love for music, and I could never imagine my life without it which is why Dro and I have decided to incorporate the two Ideas together!</p>Although, I have worked for different salons and have learned a lot from each one, I have never felt appreciated in the workplace. Most of you don't know this, but I recently lost my job as a Salon Manager for a Corporation that I will not name, due to the fact that I took paid personal time off to spend time with my sick grandmother (which was approved by corporate). When returning to my job, she passed a week later and I had to go back out of state for the funeral. My district manager was not happy about this and had no sympathy for the loss of a family member who meant a lot to me. Because of this, they were trying to find ANY reason to let me go.  They ended up accusing me of stealing, without proof and suspended me from work and forcing me pay a fee of $500 for something I didn't do. I received a call 2 days later to find out that I had been ""let go"" and it was corporates decision. After I went to the work place to gather my belongings, I secretly found out that my position was terminated a week before any of this took place and that they just needed a reason to let me go. <br/><br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Most people who I’ve worked with have never believed in me or have always assumed I was going to fail due to my age or style of dress, which is primarily why I was let go from this company. Many of them have never even given me a chance to prove them wrong. In the past, it has made me feel worthless and incompetent in regards to my work and I’m sure each and every one of you currently working a day job can relate. Today, I am eager to prove them all wrong. So we proudly Introduce you to Seven Sins Salon! Where “Beauty is Only Sin Deep.” We are in the process of creating a Rock and Roll themed Salon, where people like us won’t be judged by our physical appearance and all beauty is excepted! We welcome everyone with open arms to join us in helping us create an atmosphere that most places don’t offer! Seven Sins is a full-service salon dedicated to consistently providing high customer satisfaction by rendering excellent service, high quality products, and furnishing a rock and roll atmosphere at an acceptable price and value relationship. We will also maintain a friendly, fair, creative and unique environment, which respects diversity, ideas, and hard work. Our Mission is to create an environment where our customers are able to be themselves, to supply services and products that will enhance our clients inner beauty as well as their mental enjoyment.</span><div>

<br/><b>Dro</b>:<br/><p>Hi, my name is Dro Simoes. Most of you may know me as “The Dro”, Bassist of the band Deadstar Assembly. I just turned 33 years old a few days ago and Mel and I have been together for almost 5 years now. We decided to open this salon together not only to go into business for ourselves, but also to have a place where friends and fans can come hang out and get their hair or makeup done without the uncomfortable feeling of being out of place in a standard corporate-run salon. I have had so many friends and members of both famous and infamous bands request that Mel help them with their hair or makeup, but they have always refused to enter the salon’s she’s worked for and would rather the job be done in a private setting like a home. Unfortunately, there are some laws against legally operating a cosmetology business out of homes due to sanitation and we figured it would be awesome to have a place where people like us can go, feel like they can fit in, and have fun while getting their beauty on!</p>
<b>Enter Seven Sins Salon!</b><br/>So what exactly is Seven Sins Salon? Seven Sins Salon is a full-service beauty salon that will be open to doing certain styles of makeup and hair that is rare to find in any other salon currently out there. Sure, there are definitely some salons where you will see stylists that are tattooed with brightly dyed hair, but the rules in those salons usually follow the same rules as other corporate settings where certain things are not allowed or accepted. Our plan is to break that mold and start a salon where you will get to hang out in an entertaining atmosphere with rock and electronic music, gaming stations, music gear and much more! We are going to master in Goth, Rock, and Punk styles but of course we are also going to service anyone else who loves the atmosphere of our salon with no prejudices  against how you look or dress.<br/><br/><p>So by now you probably get the idea. Sure it’s a rocker salon, but what is going to set us apart from the rest? This is where the Seven Sins comes in. Each section of the salon is going to be named after a sin and we’re also incorporating other play on words. For example, most salons have a coffee bar or some sort of bar where customers can have drinks or snacks as they wait for their turn in the chair. We’re going to do something similar, but it’s going to be a ""Coffin Bar”. Our coffin bar is going to serve coffee, teas, non-alcoholic, and alcoholic drinks. We will also occasionally have snacks such as VooDoo Donuts and more!</p>
<b>Here is the current concept for the Seven Sins Salon areas:</b><br/><p><b>Lust</b>: Beauty Area (Hair cutting stations)<b><br/>Greed</b>: Receptionist Area / Cash Register<b><br/>Gluttony</b>: Coffin Bar (Coffee, Drinks, and Occasional Snacks)<b><br/>Sloth</b>: Guest Waiting Area / Gaming Area<b><br/>Wrath</b>: Color Mixing Area<b><br/>Envy</b>: Chalkboard Wall (Band Wall)<b><br/>Pride</b>: Photo Shoot Wall</p>
<b>More about SLOTH</b>:<p>The guest waiting area is going to be comprised of a couch, a 42in Monitor and video game consoles. some of the consoles that we can currently make available are XBOX, XBOX360, Playstation, Playstation 2, Nintendo, Nintendo 64, Sega Genesis, Gameboy and more! This will be the area where guests can relax and chill while they are waiting for a service or a friend who may be getting a service done at the time.</p>
<b>More about PRIDE &amp; ENVY</b>:<p>We are also going to give the opportunities for touring bands to use the salon if they want to have a stylist and makeup artist work on them before heading to the show. The way this will work is that bands coming into town can call ahead and schedule a time-slot. They will have the option to have the salon close down for a couple of hours in order to have a private area to get ready in and they can also choose to keep the salon open for meet and greets. This way fans can come in and hang out with the band as they get ready. The PRIDE wall will be the area where we shoot photos of the bands and possible fans after they are ready and we will have them sign the photo or our chalkboard wall in the ENVY section. The only thing we ask is for the bands to help promote the salon by mentioning that they are there getting ready. If it’s a private salon day, they can make the post once they head out to the show. This means bands will have a cool place to hang out and get ready in, get their drink on, and have fans meet up for photos and autographs before the show.</p>

<br/><p align=""center""><b>MONEY!</b></p>We came up with the idea for seven sins salon a little while back and began putting together the business plan so we can figure out what we have, what we need, and how we can improve on the ideas we already had. We quickly realized that costs began to add up and we shot to the banks in order to start this journey. We opened up a business account, registered the business name, found a building for the salon and so on. We realized that we spent about $10,000 but still needed another loan to get the rest of the products and salon equipment in order to open the doors and begin allowing customers to check out the awesome place we’ve been working so hard for. Unfortunately, the banks took one look at us and probably decided we weren’t very serious and denied helping us with a loan. The funny thing is that Mel has great credit and one of the guys at the bank even said himself that he had no idea why we were denied because we had everything in place needed to secure the rest of the money we needed to open our doors. The loan we asked for was lower than most car loans and we proved that we already had the income to pay off the loan should anything happen.<br/><br/><p>So now you’re wondering if we already put $10,000 in, why do we need more? We want you guys to see that every last penny you donate is going towards the salon. There are so many shady people on Indiegogo and Kickstarter that you never know if they’re projects are legit. So we decided we were going to list all of the things we are going to purchase with the money along with our projected necessities. When it comes to the design and marketing, we still have a lot of work to do but this is a task we are taking upon ourselves to do. The logo on this page is just a temporary one, and so is the website theme, but as they get updated we will be sure to let you guys know so you can see them and let us know what you think!<br/></p>

We would like to introduce ourselves, for those of you who don’t know us:Mel:My name is Melissa O’Connell and I am 22 years old. When I was a little girl, I was introduced to Rock and Roll music at a very young age. Growing up, I wasn’t sure whether I wanted to follow my father's footsteps and pursue a career in the Music Industry or become a Beautician. I have since become a Hairstylist and Makeup Artist for a little over 5 years now. As soon as I graduated high school, I decided to enroll myself in Cosmetology School. I have worked for various different Salons in the past, and have learned a lot from each one. I still have a complete love for music, and I could never imagine my life without it which is why Dro and I have decided to incorporate the two Ideas together!Although, I have worked for different salons and have learned a lot from each one, I have never felt appreciated in the workplace. Most of you don't know this, but I recently lost my job as a Salon Manager for a Corporation that I will not name, due to the fact that I took paid personal time off to spend time with my sick grandmother (which was approved by corporate). When returning to my job, she passed a week later and I had to go back out of state for the funeral. My district manager was not happy about this and had no sympathy for the loss of a family member who meant a lot to me. Because of this, they were trying to find ANY reason to let me go.  They ended up accusing me of stealing, without proof and suspended me from work and forcing me pay a fee of $500 for something I didn't do. I received a call 2 days later to find out that I had been ""let go"" and it was corporates decision. After I went to the work place to gather my belongings, I secretly found out that my position was terminated a week before any of this took place and that they just needed a reason to let me go. Most people who I’ve worked with have never believed in me or have always assumed I was going to fail due to my age or style of dress, which is primarily why I was let go from this company. Many of them have never even given me a chance to prove them wrong. In the past, it has made me feel worthless and incompetent in regards to my work and I’m sure each and every one of you currently working a day job can relate. Today, I am eager to prove them all wrong. So we proudly Introduce you to Seven Sins Salon! Where “Beauty is Only Sin Deep.” We are in the process of creating a Rock and Roll themed Salon, where people like us won’t be judged by our physical appearance and all beauty is excepted! We welcome everyone with open arms to join us in helping us create an atmosphere that most places don’t offer! Seven Sins is a full-service salon dedicated to consistently providing high customer satisfaction by rendering excellent service, high quality products, and furnishing a rock and roll atmosphere at an acceptable price and value relationship. We will also maintain a friendly, fair, creative and unique environment, which respects diversity, ideas, and hard work. Our Mission is to create an environment where our customers are able to be themselves, to supply services and products that will enhance our clients inner beauty as well as their mental enjoyment.
We have already put in about $10,000 of our own hard earned money into this business, but unfortunately things can get expensive and prices for products and equipment stack up quick, which is where you guys come in. But first, here’s Dro’s story!


Dro:Hi, my name is Dro Simoes. Most of you may know me as “The Dro”, Bassist of the band Deadstar Assembly. I just turned 33 years old a few days ago and Mel and I have been together for almost 5 years now. We decided to open this salon together not only to go into business for ourselves, but also to have a place where friends and fans can come hang out and get their hair or makeup done without the uncomfortable feeling of being out of place in a standard corporate-run salon. I have had so many friends and members of both famous and infamous bands request that Mel help them with their hair or makeup, but they have always refused to enter the salon’s she’s worked for and would rather the job be done in a private setting like a home. Unfortunately, there are some laws against legally operating a cosmetology business out of homes due to sanitation and we figured it would be awesome to have a place where people like us can go, feel like they can fit in, and have fun while getting their beauty on!
Enter Seven Sins Salon!So what exactly is Seven Sins Salon? Seven Sins Salon is a full-service beauty salon that will be open to doing certain styles of makeup and hair that is rare to find in any other salon currently out there. Sure, there are definitely some salons where you will see stylists that are tattooed with brightly dyed hair, but the rules in those salons usually follow the same rules as other corporate settings where certain things are not allowed or accepted. Our plan is to break that mold and start a salon where you will get to hang out in an entertaining atmosphere with rock and electronic music, gaming stations, music gear and much more! We are going to master in Goth, Rock, and Punk styles but of course we are also going to service anyone else who loves the atmosphere of our salon with no prejudices  against how you look or dress.So by now you probably get the idea. Sure it’s a rocker salon, but what is going to set us apart from the rest? This is where the Seven Sins comes in. Each section of the salon is going to be named after a sin and we’re also incorporating other play on words. For example, most salons have a coffee bar or some sort of bar where customers can have drinks or snacks as they wait for their turn in the chair. We’re going to do something similar, but it’s going to be a ""Coffin Bar”. Our coffin bar is going to serve coffee, teas, non-alcoholic, and alcoholic drinks. We will also occasionally have snacks such as VooDoo Donuts and more!
Here is the current concept for the Seven Sins Salon areas:Lust: Beauty Area (Hair cutting stations)Greed: Receptionist Area / Cash RegisterGluttony: Coffin Bar (Coffee, Drinks, and Occasional Snacks)Sloth: Guest Waiting Area / Gaming AreaWrath: Color Mixing AreaEnvy: Chalkboard Wall (Band Wall)Pride: Photo Shoot Wall
More about SLOTH:The guest waiting area is going to be comprised of a couch, a 42in Monitor and video game consoles. some of the consoles that we can currently make available are XBOX, XBOX360, Playstation, Playstation 2, Nintendo, Nintendo 64, Sega Genesis, Gameboy and more! This will be the area where guests can relax and chill while they are waiting for a service or a friend who may be getting a service done at the time.
More about PRIDE & ENVY:We are also going to give the opportunities for touring bands to use the salon if they want to have a stylist and makeup artist work on them before heading to the show. The way this will work is that bands coming into town can call ahead and schedule a time-slot. They will have the option to have the salon close down for a couple of hours in order to have a private area to get ready in and they can also choose to keep the salon open for meet and greets.

<h3>Why &amp; What</h3>
<p>This campaign isn't in the spirit of <i>""please give us your money so we can achieve our dream.""</i>  We have worked hard for five years to establish a solid brand and grow the winery from 175 cases to 1,000 cases. <br/></p>
You may think 'bravo', but we are not resting on our grape leaves.  In the wine industry, that size isn't enough to 'escape gravity' as a standalone business. Micro wineries are growing every year, but not as rapidly as micro breweries, in part because of the much higher capital investments required for growth.<br/>We need your help taking our small business to the next level, and are willing to give you fair trade in ""Perks"" for your investment.<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438469210/lz1vymolfhlfo2xoo4b7.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 476.866px; height: 284px;""/><br/>We have embarked on this campaign to ""escape gravity"" and set us on a 5 year plan of growing Two Shepherds into a ~3,000 case a year winery. Still small, but a volume that allows the winery to self-fund, be more creative, sustainable, and a full time career for William. <br/><br/>In July, we signed a lease for a warehouse facility that was a video production studio, and undertook the conversion into a winery, adding drains, power, cooling etc, working around the clock. As of late August, the winery shifted into production, as Mother Nature waits for no-one. We are operational but lacking lab equipment, sorely need a larger press and other equipment. <br/><br/>
<p>The hard work and long hours, nor the day jobs, end with this campaign.

This is the critical step to achieving our goal of being able to focus solely on crafting unique wines, expanding our wine offers, and ""escape gravity.""<br/></p>

<h3>Who is Two Shepherds<br/>
</h3>
<p><a href=""http://twoshepherds.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Two Shepherds</a> is a micro winery making about 1,000 cases a year of 
hand crafted, small lot Rhone wines. <a href=""http://store.twoshepherds.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fifteen different lots</a>. 1000 cases bottled in 2013.</p>
<p>Principal/winemaker William Allen is known in 
the wine industry as a passionate advocate of small lot, natural, old world style
 wines. The wine industry is not one 
ideally suited for small producers making a living. Thus for 5
 years, William has subsidized the growth of Two Shepherds with his day job, spending nights 
and weekends making wine. A true labor of love.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Chief Shepherdess Karen's foray into wine started early
in life. At age 3, she decided to figure out how to walk backwards upstairs
while carrying an expensive bottle of wine. Luckily, more recent wine endeavors
have been more successful including working for 7 years at a wine importer in
NYC. Yearning to be closer to the vines, she moved to Sonoma 5 years ago to
work at a large wine company. One day she tasted the Two Shepherds Grenache
Blanc and fell heads over heels. Soon after she fell for William.</p> After intensive pondering, we have decided to make the challenging leap to grow the next 5 years to ~3,000 cases. This will make it a full time endeavor for William, allowing him to focus his energy,

<h3>What We Need and What Your Dollars Enable<br/>

<p>Converting this 3,600 square foot warehouse to a winery entails many 
things like installing floor drains, a crush pad wet area, basic cooling, as well as buying a myriad of equipment such as a forklift, press, crusher/destemmer, cleaning equipment, tanks, and more. We have bare bones, but not enough. <br/></p>

Sometimes when I do go shopping, I end up buying ingredients that I don't use and usually throw away. So after a brainstorming session with some friends we realized that there is a better way.I believe in eating healthy and have a passion for helping my community and the environment.  That’s why I created a business that reflects these ideals.We only provide organic food because it is our belief that your body will benefit from a healthy, nutritious diet. And so our main goal became to provide nutritious meals and the education of  people as to the many advantages of a well balanced diet that are easy to prepare along with easy to follow instructions on how to make them yourself. And by using The U Chef unprocessed and healthy meals will help you stay at the weight you are or reach your weight goal, that's just a plus when you eat healthy and exercise. When you eat right you feel better and your body will react better as well.I’m extremely passionate about helping environment. I have done internships in ecological non-profit organizations. I volunteer to clean at least 4 to 5 beaches a year. I’m very concerned on the amount of waste meal kit companies create. That's the reason why we only want to use biodegradable, compostable, eco-friendly and recycled containers, bags and boxes.  We will always strive to be as sustainable as possible and help our users to recycle and have a more sustainable  way of living. I want my company to help our community and I believe in sharing our success. That’s why The U Chef will donate one family meal  for  every 300 meals we prepare, package and deliver. We will donate to a family in need or an organization to be determined in the near future. Your contribution will help me  achieve this dream.  It will not only help me  but you will help many other people in need and reduce the pollution of the environment.

</div><div> <p>Hello My name is jarred and i am from Rivers Manitoba, i am 27 and i have lived here all my life. The reason i am campaigning is my goal is to give back to my community, and give back to the golf course. Growing up i became a member at Riverdale Golf and Country Club at 8 years old and i have been one ever since. I am now also on the Club Board. </p>
<p>Our Course over the past couple years has had a rough couple starts to the year, thanks to the weather and the flooding that occurred has financially hurt us. I am asking for help because i want this golf course to continue to run next year and many ore years after, for the children and people who live in our community, and for the people visiting our community. </p>
<p>I am asking for 20,000 in funding, and the reason why is i believe this amount can fiscally keep us strong for many years to come and also allow us to upgrade the course a little bit as well. Whether it be signs, new flags, new blocks for the teeboxes, fixing any water lines, etc. If we can't reach our goal of 20,000. Any money raised on here will still go toward the community golf course. </p>
<p>I believe our Project is extremely valuable as it is very important to our town as it is one of our main draws. Our Course is very affordable for families, and I want to be able to keep prices down so the next generation can enjoy our course as well. I have never done any sort of crowdfunding before. I hope you will not only help back our community golf course, but back our future. </p>

Pasta, the world's favorite food. Good match, huh? </span></h3> <p></p>
<h3>We moved to Thailand, the motherland of edible insects, to <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">produce an innovative super-food: bug-based pasta.<span><br/></span></span><br/> Our pasta is a combination of rice, tapioca, and cricket powder. It's healthy, sustainable, and delicious. Help us spread the word and market it to the world!</h3>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
</div><div> <p></p>
<h1>THE ANSWER IS RIGHT AT YOUR FEET</h1>
<div><br/></div>
<p><em>Welcome to Earth, the insect planet. Did you know that 80% of the world eats bugs? It's only westerners that have stopped and forgotten that they are the best sources of protein. </em></p>
<p><em><b>Thailand</b>, the land of smiles, beautiful beaches, and edible insects. Where fried scorpions, meal worms, and crickets are sold as street food.</em><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> Thailand is where edible insects are a solid, serious business: there are over 20,000 farmers breeding crickets, registered with the Ministry of Agriculture, and supervised by the University of Khon Kaen. The tropical location is also a key advantage: crickets need very warm weather to grow. That's why producing insect-based food makes more sense here than in the west. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span></span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b><i>OK, we've got the crickets now, but why eat them? <span><br/></span><span><br/></span></i></b></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Food quality</strong>. Crickets are made up of mostly protein, up to 70% of their weight in fact. That’s more than double the amount that a cow has. They also contain as much calcium as milk, are rich in Omega-3, and a have as much vitamin B12 as salmon.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sustainability</strong>. They need very little food and water (1,000 time less than a cow) and they grow fast. Crickets only require 2 kg of feed to make 1 kg of protein (while a cow needs 10 kg). There is a looooong list of reasons why insects are the green way to proteins, see <a href=""http://qz.com/84127/five-reasons-we-should-all-be-eating-insects/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">this article</a>, for example.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Food to feed the world</strong>. United Nations' FAO agency has been promoting edible insects for years, as they might help undeveloped countries now, and the entire world in 15 years, when the population is expected to be more than 9 billion. See the FAO document <a href=""http://www.fao.org/forestry/edibleinsects/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gluten free, antibiotics free</strong>. Our pasta is made in a gluten free factory and is certified gluten free. The pasta is also packed with added benefits, such as no cholesterol and zero antibiotics.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can find more details on our <a href=""http://www.bugsolutely.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a>, including a blog that we update weekly.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b><i>Great, we like crickets. But why pasta? <span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span></i></b>It would be hard to convince people to start a new nutritional behavior by eating whole crickets. Westerners eat oysters, cow tongue, frogs but not crickets - even if they are closely related to shrimps, which we love. It's a cultural obstacle, but pasta containing cricket flour is a great first step. No whole insects involved and no discerning insect shape. It is mixed with other flours, boiled, and eaten with sauce. </p>
<p>It's simply the world's favorite food (see link at the bottom). This is a fast, easy, road map towards <strong>edible insects</strong>. Oh, and our pasta is tasty too.  Here are some photos of our first production run.<br/></p>

<h1>The market landscape at the moment:<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>
</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Some <strong>insect-based food</strong> are already available in the US and some European countries (i.e. energy bars, cookies, burgers, crackers). Surprisingly, we did not find any pasta based on cricket flour, apart from a local project available only in a few shops in Belgium (and with mealworms instead of crickets).</p></li>
<li><p>Pasta is a product suitable for <strong>restaurants</strong>, too. Chefs are at the top of our target market. Signature dishes with insects or insect flavors are fashionable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Production cost </strong>in Thailand are much lower than in the west. Crickets are as cheap as $4/kg, given the number of farmers breeding them, while very high costs in the US (up to ten times higher) are slowing down this revolution.</p></li>
<li><p>Edible insects are gaining <strong>popularity</strong>, thanks to the work of the pioneers and to positive press coverage. According to a recent US <a href=""http://www.tiny-farms.com/blog"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">survey</a>, roughly one-third of respondents rate themselves likely to buy an insect-based product.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Developing expertise in this field is a savvy <strong>investment</strong>: the United Nations, the European Union and, a number of large companies are exploring the possibilities of farming edible insects, producing flour from them, and of course creating and producing foods.</p>

<h1>The funding will go towards:</h1>
<p><strong>If target is not reached <span><br/></span></strong>- funds will be used to cover the costs of making the first batch of pasta, and rewards will be sent to backers. Cricket flour constitutes the highest cost for operations, as cricket flour is about 9 time more expensive than standard rice flour.

Pasta, the world's favorite food. Good match, huh?  
We moved to Thailand, the motherland of edible insects, to produce an innovative super-food: bug-based pasta. Our pasta is a combination of rice, tapioca, and cricket powder. It's healthy, sustainable, and delicious. Help us spread the word and market it to the world!
   
 
THE ANSWER IS RIGHT AT YOUR FEET

Welcome to Earth, the insect planet. Did you know that 80% of the world eats bugs? It's only westerners that have stopped and forgotten that they are the best sources of protein. 
Thailand, the land of smiles, beautiful beaches, and edible insects. Where fried scorpions, meal worms, and crickets are sold as street food. Thailand is where edible insects are a solid, serious business: there are over 20,000 farmers breeding crickets, registered with the Ministry of Agriculture, and supervised by the University of Khon Kaen. The tropical location is also a key advantage: crickets need very warm weather to grow. That's why producing insect-based food makes more sense here than in the west. 

OK, we've got the crickets now, but why eat them? 

Food quality. Crickets are made up of mostly protein, up to 70% of their weight in fact. That’s more than double the amount that a cow has. They also contain as much calcium as milk, are rich in Omega-3, and a have as much vitamin B12 as salmon.
Sustainability. They need very little food and water (1,000 time less than a cow) and they grow fast. Crickets only require 2 kg of feed to make 1 kg of protein (while a cow needs 10 kg). There is a looooong list of reasons why insects are the green way to proteins, see this article, for example.
Food to feed the world. United Nations' FAO agency has been promoting edible insects for years, as they might help undeveloped countries now, and the entire world in 15 years, when the population is expected to be more than 9 billion. See the FAO document here. 
Gluten free, antibiotics free. Our pasta is made in a gluten free factory and is certified gluten free. The pasta is also packed with added benefits, such as no cholesterol and zero antibiotics.

You can find more details on our website, including a blog that we update weekly.

Great, we like crickets. But why pasta? It would be hard to convince people to start a new nutritional behavior by eating whole crickets. Westerners eat oysters, cow tongue, frogs but not crickets - even if they are closely related to shrimps, which we love. It's a cultural obstacle, but pasta containing cricket flour is a great first step. No whole insects involved and no discerning insect shape. It is mixed with other flours, boiled, and eaten with sauce. 
It's simply the world's favorite food (see link at the bottom). This is a fast, easy, road map towards edible insects. Oh, and our pasta is tasty too.  Here are some photos of our first production run.


   

  


The market landscape at the moment:


Some insect-based food are already available in the US and some European countries (i.e. energy bars, cookies, burgers, crackers). Surprisingly, we did not find any pasta based on cricket flour, apart from a local project available only in a few shops in Belgium (and with mealworms instead of crickets).
Pasta is a product suitable for restaurants, too. Chefs are at the top of our target market. Signature dishes with insects or insect flavors are fashionable.
Production cost in Thailand are much lower than in the west. Crickets are as cheap as $4/kg, given the number of farmers breeding them, while very high costs in the US (up to ten times higher) are slowing down this revolution.
Edible insects are gaining popularity, thanks to the work of the pioneers and to positive press coverage. According to a recent US survey, roughly one-third of respondents rate themselves likely to buy an insect-based product.

Developing expertise in this field is a savvy investment: the United Nations, the European Union and, a number of large companies are exploring the possibilities of farming edible insects, producing flour from them, and of course creating and producing foods.

A few words from our team:





The funding will go towards:
If target is not reached - funds will be used to cover the costs of making the first batch of pasta, and rewards will be sent to backers. Cricket flour constitutes the highest cost for operations, as cricket flour is about 9 time more expensive than standard rice flour. The manufacturers requires a 250 kgs minimum batch order for production. This is a total of about $2,400, and $350 for the packaging. The rest will be spent on shipping costs to fulfill backer rewards.
If 100% of funding is fulfilled - 50% will go to pasta manufacturing (this includes the cost of flour and packaging) which will cost $9,500 With full funding fulfillment, we can run a larger batch (and by doing that reducing the costs and optimizing the production). - 50% to marketing (consumer online marketing 35% trade/B2B marketing online 15%) TOTAL $9,500 Thanks to part of our team having graphical and web development skills, we have been able to save money in that regard so far. In the future, costs associated with corporate image, website updates, and content marketing in English language will have the funding needs fulfilled partly by this funding campaign. We also plan to have more languages for advertising supported, some Facebook post boosting (paid ads) and a little Google keyword advertising. Part of this is aimed at finding distributors, importers, and other potential partners in some selected countries.

<h3><b>About the new solar technology</b></h3>
<p>
</p>
<p><i>„<b>IT
IS A NEW SOLAR TECHNOLOGY THAT GLOBALLY SOLVES ENERGETICS AND
CLEANLINESS OF THE ATMOSPHERE ON THE WHOLE EARTH“ said Mr Jan
Sehnoutek, the author and the inventor of the new Solar Technology.</b></i></p>
1 / Patent Pub. No.: WO/2012/167759, International Application
No..: PCT/CZ2011/000063<b> solves significantly enhance performance
of solar energy</b>, many times. The new system is able to respond to
the movement of the sun, the curved surfaces , mobile and scrollable
/ storable - his performance should be even greater – has to be
proven by tests.
<p>2 / The new technology is based on very simple - <b>cheap and
available components</b> such as lenses of various shapes and
materials, and their supporting structures, whether in the form of
foil, mesh or plates or plates of different materials. Also,
production is based on the <b>simplest tools and aids</b>. <b>The
system can provide electricity and heat for entire cities or
neighborhoods, both old buildings and new construction.</b></p>
<p>3 / When the new system is used across the board, the situation
may occur that <b>the clean energy power thus obtained from the sun
will replace the thermal power and nuclear power plants</b>
(hydroelectric power as well, of course). 
</p>
<p>4 / The new system can be applied to already implemented solar
arrays, which are simply mounted on mobile and static already placed
solar panels with <b>minimal technical addition</b>.</p>
<p>5 / <b>The system deals not only with electricity but also with
hot water and heating</b>. In combination with photovoltaic solar
system leads to the situation that the object becomes a <b>truly
independent operating at full capacity and can supply energy and heat
as well to objects in their surroundings (also heated in the winter
roads and public lighting). </b>The system is suitable for increasing
its efficiency, add a suitable storage unit that the current surplus
of electricity and heat can preserve for the time when needed -
winter climate, large and long clouds, etc.</p>
<p>6 / When using the new system it will save, except the risk of
nuclear disasters, <b>vast economic resources.</b></p>
<p>7 / With undemanding application of the new system is not only
getting uncompromising economic savings in the billions of dollars a
year, but <b>also create jobs </b>in a huge amount especially for
ordinary citizens.</p>
<p>8 / <b>The system makes use for its efficiency solar energy,
which is always available, everywhere, for free and in needed
quantity. It is ecological and malleable. So there is a new
technology that will save humanity not only themselves but also the
planet from pollution and ecological self-destruction.</b></p>

<br/><h3>About the author<br/>
</h3> <p></p>
<p>The whole of my life I have been interested in varies technologies and designs (this year it is my 40th year of my practice). I work alone. <br/></p>
<p>I always design or project products that can help people in their needs or can fulfill their dreams.<br/></p>
<p>I love to start where all others have ended. <br/></p>
<p>And here are some more information about myself:</p>
<p>EDUCATION:<br/>1.    Education in carpentry (3 years)<br/>2.    Secondary Arts and Craft Schools - carpenter, construction of furniture (4 years)<br/>3.    Technical University of Zvolen – Faculty of Wood Sciences and Technology (3 years)<br/><br/>PROFESSION:    <br/>Inventer of solar power system. Designer, Constructer, Architect of interiors, inside lay-outs and selected types of constructions, Builder, Analyst and Developer of new systems, Author of more than 50 patents,  Utility and industry models – patents in Czech Republic and abroad in field of wooden/metal constructions and other technologies in construction field and design, System and Project Manager, Provider of licences on the world basis, <br/><br/>SPECIALIZATION:    <br/>solar power system provider, solution of construct items and design – aimed on interiors, setting-up strategy of sales for specific fields – elimination of commercial effects: financially demanding, fasion, etc.; setting-up an application of new technologies – in field of wooden goods and constructions; new constructions and technologies for long-term usage; productin of system complex – its application with effect on social field and elimination of risk.<br/><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Problem with the location, realised projects &amp; the drawer<br/>
</h3>My problem is that I live in conditions that do not allow me to fully finance my ideas, products which are recognized and valued all over the world. Most of them have been realised (for example: gradual construction of a house for young people, small nursery for small villages, small house for old people from small villages - so that they do not have to move from their villages, universal wooden bookshelf for young people - by this can be furnished the whole flat, etc. <br/><br/><p>The only thing I want is not to project and design and then put it all into a drawer...</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Payment of the development and sim.<br/>
</h3>I myself pay the development, simple prothotypes and registration and keeping the validity of the patents in my country. <br/>
<p></p>
<h3>The goal of the new Solar Technology<br/>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The goal of the solar patent is for minimal costs increase effect of solar radiation and to provide source of electricity, hot water and heating even for the most poor people anywhere on the world. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Ambitions of the new Solar Technology<br/>
</h3>My patent has ambitions to put aside even the newest and most advance solar technology into a shadow. <br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What we need now in steps<br/>
</h3>Now we need to finance a patent registration in the selected countries such as USA, Europe, Africa, Asia etc. (costs already approx. 80 thousand Pounds). This is the first step.<p></p>
<p>Another step is to finance production of the new solar panel, which solves photovoltaics, thermics and focal ration at once (production will have been realised by one of good quality university in Czech Republic; costs approx. 135 thousand Pounds).</p>
<p>At the same time a production of other prothotypes into agricultare (gardens´ and fields´warming foils, yearlong greenhouses, etc.), construction field (inteligent plastering, providing of energetically full independent small objects - one nursery has been already builded) can be started. Costs approx. 50 th. till 1 mil. Pounds. <br/></p>

„IT
IS A NEW SOLAR TECHNOLOGY THAT GLOBALLY SOLVES ENERGETICS AND
CLEANLINESS OF THE ATMOSPHERE ON THE WHOLE EARTH“ said Mr Jan
Sehnoutek, the author and the inventor of the new Solar Technology.
1 / Patent Pub. No.: WO/2012/167759, International Application
No..: PCT/CZ2011/000063 solves significantly enhance performance
of solar energy, many times. The new system is able to respond to
the movement of the sun, the curved surfaces , mobile and scrollable
/ storable - his performance should be even greater – has to be
proven by tests.
2 / The new technology is based on very simple - cheap and
available components such as lenses of various shapes and
materials, and their supporting structures, whether in the form of
foil, mesh or plates or plates of different materials. Also,
production is based on the simplest tools and aids. The
system can provide electricity and heat for entire cities or
neighborhoods, both old buildings and new construction.
3 / When the new system is used across the board, the situation
may occur that the clean energy power thus obtained from the sun
will replace the thermal power and nuclear power plants
(hydroelectric power as well, of course). 

4 / The new system can be applied to already implemented solar
arrays, which are simply mounted on mobile and static already placed
solar panels with minimal technical addition.
5 / The system deals not only with electricity but also with
hot water and heating. In combination with photovoltaic solar
system leads to the situation that the object becomes a truly
independent operating at full capacity and can supply energy and heat
as well to objects in their surroundings (also heated in the winter
roads and public lighting). The system is suitable for increasing
its efficiency, add a suitable storage unit that the current surplus
of electricity and heat can preserve for the time when needed -
winter climate, large and long clouds, etc.
6 / When using the new system it will save, except the risk of
nuclear disasters, vast economic resources.
7 / With undemanding application of the new system is not only
getting uncompromising economic savings in the billions of dollars a
year, but also create jobs in a huge amount especially for
ordinary citizens.
8 / The system makes use for its efficiency solar energy,
which is always available, everywhere, for free and in needed
quantity. It is ecological and malleable. So there is a new
technology that will save humanity not only themselves but also the
planet from pollution and ecological self-destruction.

About the author
 
The whole of my life I have been interested in varies technologies and designs (this year it is my 40th year of my practice). I work alone. 
I always design or project products that can help people in their needs or can fulfill their dreams.
I love to start where all others have ended. 
And here are some more information about myself:
EDUCATION:1.    Education in carpentry (3 years)2.    Secondary Arts and Craft Schools - carpenter, construction of furniture (4 years)3.    Technical University of Zvolen – Faculty of Wood Sciences and Technology (3 years)PROFESSION:    Inventer of solar power system. Designer, Constructer, Architect of interiors, inside lay-outs and selected types of constructions, Builder, Analyst and Developer of new systems, Author of more than 50 patents,  Utility and industry models – patents in Czech Republic and abroad in field of wooden/metal constructions and other technologies in construction field and design, System and Project Manager, Provider of licences on the world basis, SPECIALIZATION:    solar power system provider, solution of construct items and design – aimed on interiors, setting-up strategy of sales for specific fields – elimination of commercial effects: financially demanding, fasion, etc.; setting-up an application of new technologies – in field of wooden goods and constructions; new constructions and technologies for long-term usage; productin of system complex – its application with effect on social field and elimination of risk.

Problem with the location, realised projects & the drawer
My problem is that I live in conditions that do not allow me to fully finance my ideas, products which are recognized and valued all over the world. Most of them have been realised (for example: gradual construction of a house for young people, small nursery for small villages, small house for old people from small villages - so that they do not have to move from their villages, universal wooden bookshelf for young people - by this can be furnished the whole flat, etc. The only thing I want is not to project and design and then put it all into a drawer...

Payment of the development and sim.
I myself pay the development, simple prothotypes and registration and keeping the validity of the patents in my country. 

The goal of the new Solar Technology


The goal of the solar patent is for minimal costs increase effect of solar radiation and to provide source of electricity, hot water and heating even for the most poor people anywhere on the world. 

Ambitions of the new Solar Technology
My patent has ambitions to put aside even the newest and most advance solar technology into a shadow. 

What we need now in steps
Now we need to finance a patent registration in the selected countries such as USA, Europe, Africa, Asia etc. (costs already approx. 80 thousand Pounds). This is the first step.
Another step is to finance production of the new solar panel, which solves photovoltaics, thermics and focal ration at once (production will have been realised by one of good quality university in Czech Republic; costs approx. 135 thousand Pounds).
At the same time a production of other prothotypes into agricultare (gardens´ and fields´warming foils, yearlong greenhouses, etc.), construction field (inteligent plastering, providing of energetically full independent small objects - one nursery has been already builded) can be started. Costs approx. 50 th. till 1 mil. Pounds.

</div><h3>Ramshackle Brewing Company </h3><p>We are more than being about beer, we are about creating a community. </p><p>In
 2009, we came across some brewing equipment, and that was the  start of
 more than a hobby, it became a passion. Zack Bigelow started  brewing 
after a few weeks of research to make his first beer. The first  beer 
became a success and attracted attention of some friends. Zack  asked his friend, Joe Kesselring, to come out and brew on a <span><span>Sunday</span></span>
 and  learn about the brewing process. From that day forward, Zack and 
Joe have brewed in the back yard of Zack and Jessy's home on every Sunday that weather allowed. </p><p>It
 is hard to accept praise from others. When people began to say,""When  
are you making the Brown Ale again?"", ""Can I come get a six pack of that
 beer you made?"", and ""What will it take to get you to do this  
professionally?"", we decided it was time that we turn our passionate  
hobby into a passionate brewery to share with everyone.</p><p>Ramshackle
 Brewing Company will be in  Jonesville, 
MI.  Located directly on US 12, Jonesville is in Hillsdale  County; in 
the center of southern Michigan. The growing community, that  
recently became a city, is seeking a place to attract locals and 
tourists alike. With the nearest brewery being a 35 minute drive away, 
we decided  it was time to put our brewery here to give everyone a new 
reason to enjoy
 our awesome county. We reached out to the City of  Jonesville in 2014, 
asking if we could build there and they have  welcomed us with open 
arms. </p><p>Community
 is an important part of the brewery world, and what better  way to show
 our appreciation to our community than to open a brewery to  provide 
that great, hoppy, after-work beverage, or the malty sweetness you crave on a <span><span>Saturday</span></span>
 afternoon? We aren't just about the beer, though. We believe that it 
takes a community to build a successful business and a thriving city. By
 providing employment opportunities, a community meeting place, and feed
 for livestock Ramshackle Brewing Company will give
 back to the county that is helping us out.  We plan to promote what we 
call ""Pints for a Purpose"" which will help  out the non-profit 
organizations in
 Hillsdale county. Without the community,  Ramshackle wouldn't exists, 
and we would be one of the few counties  without a brewery... something 
no community wants to see. </p><p>Currently Ramshackle focuses on what are called ""Dead Ales"";
 specializing in the Beir De Garde and the  Kentucky Common. These beers
 have peeked interest in several potential  customers in Hillsdale 
county.  With your help we want to bring these rare and delicious beers back before they go extinct. </p><p>For more information about us follow our Facebook page: <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/ramshacklebrewing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.facebook.com/ramshacklebrewing</a> </p><h3>The Used Car Salesman Pitch, because we have to.  </h3>
<p>For Ramshackle to become the Jonesville's brewery, we need help... from you... our community. </p>
<p>We are asking for $250,000 which will unlock our SBA loan. We are 
currently approved by the bank to get our loan, but we
  must reach $250,000 to get the Small Business Association to 
finalize it. We know that sounds like a whole lot of money, but once our
 loan is finalized we will be able buy our 5-bbl brew system, purchase 
our  realestate, and cover all of our construction costs.  The  sooner 
we reach our $250,000 goal, the sooner we can become the brewery you 
want us to be. </p>
<p>Of
 course we wouldn't ask you for something without giving you  something 
in return... How in the hell would that be fair?? We will  assume you 
are reading the perks we already have listed... basically you can be as 
adventurous as you want to be... just need some nice words  said about 
you? Donate a dollar. Need some sweet swag to wear around  town? Get a 
t-shirt. Want to impress all of your friends? Get a painting to hang in 
your house. Want to have folklore passed down by generations on how 
sweet Uncle Mike is? Brew your own beer at Ramshackle to serve  at your 
next family reunion. Needless to say, we can go on and on about  how 
awesome you are for giving us a shot at opening your brewery. Yes,  
yours... didn't you read that paragraph about community? </p>
<p>If 
we do not reach our goal, which we know you are thinking... how  
wouldn't they get their goal, they kick ass.... we have to tell you that
 no matter what, you get your perks... and we might have to change our  
brewing system to something a little smaller... but you will get your  
brewery... mark our words. </p>
<h3>The Roll of the Dice</h3>
<p>We
 the co-founders of Ramshackle know that Rome wasn't built over  night. 
We have brewed our beers to perfection. We know what we are good  at, 
and that is making great beer. However, we 
know that just doesn't cut  it... we need to assemble a team behind us 
that will compliment great  business. We are currently clients of the 
Brewers Professional  Alliance, located in Grand Rapids Michigan. When 
we decided that a brewery  will be in our future, we knew it will take a
 lot of hard work. The BPA has  helped us learn the business side of the
 brewery industry. They are  helping us create a successful business and
 giving us the tools to grow. This means that we will spend a little 
more getting  the help we need to build a business, but we will make 
fewer mistakes and be a stronger business.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> We don't want to be  those guys asking 
for a hand out... that just isn't the Ramshackle way.  We know that help
 comes in many forms. If you don't have a way to  help us monetarily, 
there are several other ways you can help.  Shouting Ramshackle Brewing 
Company from the roof top, sharing our  Facebook page, and sharing
 our Indiegogo campaign. Got talent? We are  always looking for artists 
to assist with decorating, playing music, or  just making noise when 
it's time to build. 
<br/>Make
 sure you tell your  mom, dad, uncle, brother, next door neighbor, boss,
 pet goat, that guy  that keeps giving you the stink eye, and everyone 
else that you think  would like a good beer, good company, and a place 
of community about us! <div>

</div><p>Last year, four friends devised an adventure to bike from Key West to Tallahassee, Florida in the beginning of May. Within the span of a few months, we were hit by a string of tragedies that gave our adventure purpose. Our friend and motorcyclist Anthony Branca was killed by a distracted driver. Riders With Reason (RWR) videographer Rillan Dasalla was in two accidents with different distracted drivers (and is undergoing physical therapy). RWR member Michael Heron was cycling when he became the victim of a hit and run. We knew there was something to address. We founded Riders with Reason, a nonprofit advocacy group promoting safe and responsible driving by creating an awareness of the dangers of distracted driving.<br/></p>
<p>Establishing RWR was the start of something much larger than
a single tour across Florida, and that is why we need your help to reach our
fundraising goal. Establishing ourselves as a force and reaching as many people
as possible requires resources we do not yet have. This money will goes toward
promotion, merchandise, and travel expenses of RWR as an organization, so that
we may continue to serve the public. Our tour across Florida is funded out of
pocket, with the exception of approximately $250 that will go toward PB&amp;Js between
the four of us. To be clear, $5000 is NOT about the Florida cycle tour but about
making RWR a successful nonprofit. We have a vision for effective community
outreach, and our trip across Florida is only the start. </p>
<p>Taking bicycles a thousand miles across the state of Florida
raises eyebrows, and we’re using that to initiate a dialogue with the public
about road safety. We’re taking a familiar message- the importance of
minimizing deadly road behavior- and embracing it with a new and successful
platform. RWR prizes personal human connection, physical action, and real
results. We have more cycling tours in our future that will focus on reaching
legislation, schools, and communities across the nation. We are confident that
this is the way to reach people. We give people something to talk about, four
crazy guys on bikes bent on eliminating distracted driving. Our hope is to make
a real impact on deadly road behavior and save lives.</p>
<p>We all have a stake in this problem and we are all part of
the solution. With your donation we can make safe driving a new priority,
invigorate the public, strengthen laws and enforcement efforts, and make our
roads safer for everyone. </p>
<p>Join our mission by sharing this page.</p>

Riders With Reason (RWR) videographer Rillan Dasalla was in two accidents with different distracted drivers (and is undergoing physical therapy). RWR member Michael Heron was cycling when he became the victim of a hit and run. We knew there was something to address. We founded Riders with Reason, a nonprofit advocacy group promoting safe and responsible driving by creating an awareness of the dangers of distracted driving.
Establishing RWR was the start of something much larger than
a single tour across Florida, and that is why we need your help to reach our
fundraising goal. Establishing ourselves as a force and reaching as many people
as possible requires resources we do not yet have. This money will goes toward
promotion, merchandise, and travel expenses of RWR as an organization, so that
we may continue to serve the public. Our tour across Florida is funded out of
pocket, with the exception of approximately $250 that will go toward PB&Js between
the four of us. To be clear, $5000 is NOT about the Florida cycle tour but about
making RWR a successful nonprofit. We have a vision for effective community
outreach, and our trip across Florida is only the start. 
Taking bicycles a thousand miles across the state of Florida
raises eyebrows, and we’re using that to initiate a dialogue with the public
about road safety. We’re taking a familiar message- the importance of
minimizing deadly road behavior- and embracing it with a new and successful
platform. RWR prizes personal human connection, physical action, and real
results. We have more cycling tours in our future that will focus on reaching
legislation, schools, and communities across the nation. We are confident that
this is the way to reach people. We give people something to talk about, four
crazy guys on bikes bent on eliminating distracted driving. Our hope is to make
a real impact on deadly road behavior and save lives.
We all have a stake in this problem and we are all part of
the solution. With your donation we can make safe driving a new priority,
invigorate the public, strengthen laws and enforcement efforts, and make our
roads safer for everyone. 
Join our mission by sharing this page.

</h3>
<p>The 2012 Venesa Matram Symposium was a significant event in many ways for Sri Lankan community workers. With over 50 people attending from all areas of the island, the event provided a space for people to not only network and learn about each others work, but also created multiple opportunities for participants to break down misconceptions and stigma barriers that make collaboration and networking difficult in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>The second Symposium took place in Jaffna in 2014, hosted by Kaveri Kala Manram cultural organisation based in Chulipuram, near Jaffna. Again over 50 community workers and internationals participated in 6 days of sharing practice, culture, professional experiences and personal beliefs toward generating greater collaboration and understanding in the arts, cultural and community sectors in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>Ferment Collaborate first developed the Symposium concept in 2012 following 18 months of engagement with practitioners from around Sri Lanka throughout 2010 and 2011. A regular event that could encourage active participation, build networks and strengthen local capacity and self confidence emerged as a key to building a stronger cultural development network in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>The event, now in its third year, brings together community workers from a diverse range of specialisations, including health, education, agriculture, culture, creative arts, economic and community development and more. The Symposium is guided by a 5 year vision which aims to grow the event into an ongoing program and national network of creative community builders who acknowledge culture and place as being foundational to development.  </p>

</div>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>The program: A blend of Open Space, training and presentations</b></p>
<p>The Symposium uses a mix of curated programming (keynote and plenary discussions) and Open Space organising. Open Space is an organising tool that prioritises the skills and knowledge of participants as the basis for forming a conference or symposium program. By encouraging participants to engage with what skills, experiences and even questions about their work that they can share, and supporting them to host discussions or presentations by delivering facilitation training, the Symposium becomes a social change space not just in terms of its outcomes, but also through its delivery. Open Space empowers participants to understand the Symposium as a space for both learning and sharing.</p>
<p>The program is delivered to inspire community workers to recognise the value of their own knowledge and skills, while strengthening cross-sectoral networks and breaking down geographic, cultural and religious boundaries that have been reinforced through over 30 years of conflict and over 500 years of colonisation. We aim to create an event structure and space for Sri Lankan community workers to empower themselves and each other by supporting them to share their stories and skills, personal, professional and cultural, toward developing more effective, collaborative and inclusive networks and approaches to community development.</p>
<p>In keeping with this, the event’s program is based upon the use of Open Space Technology, a form of program organising that relies on the participants themselves to prepare and present workshops, discussions and presentations based on their own work or areas of their work they’d like to explore with other participants.</p>
<p>The program will include event production, documentation, workshop facilitation, non-violent communication and cultural development training (Days 1 and 2), the Open Space workshop program (Days 3, 4, 5 and 6), a cultural program (throughout) and a day to draw together outcomes, evaluate the event and strategise ongoing collaborations, projects and the next Symposium (Day 7). </p>

<br/><p><b>Building a platform for change</b></p>
<p>The Symposium is a significant opportunity to build stronger community development networks in Sri Lanka and for Australian community workers and the community development sector to contribute skills, experiences and resources to Sri Lankans. One of our major goals in facilitating the Symposium this year is to explore opportunities for networks, collaboration and shared projects beyond the Symposium, not just between Sri Lankan agencies, but also with Australian agencies and practitioners also.</p>
<p>The Symposium itself embodies the type of creative social change processes we support participants to deliver with their communities. We work with participants to create agreement to co-manage the event spaces so they are safe, inclusive, encouraging, collaborative and empowering.</p>

</div></div>","A program to support, connect and skill community workers in Sri Lanka

NOTE: Venesa is Sinhala for ‘change’. Matram is Tamil for ‘change’.


The Venesa Matram Symposium is a networking, skill-building, cultural exchange and collaboration-supporting event held annually in Sri Lanka for community workers who use arts, cultural and ecological practice as their primary community development tools.
In 2012 Ferment Collaborate delivered the first Venesa Matram Symposium in Hatton, Sri Lanka thanks to the fundraising efforts of people just like you! Now we embark on our third delivery of this important event, creating a space over 7 days for Sri Lankan community workers to network, train, learn and share skills, hosted by the Jayawaboda Kendraya, a cultural and social conscientisation organisation based in Negombo and managed by Ferment Collaborate, a cultural development agency based in Australia. 
We’re fundraising for 75 community workers to come together in Negombo, Sri Lanka between the 27th April and 4th May 2015. Help us create a learning, sharing and collaboration building space for community workers from all around the island, representing Sri Lanka’s cultural, geographic, religious, gender, age and creative diversity. 



   Our fundraising goals

While the Australian team who will be traveling to Sri Lanka for the event are busy fundraising their own travel costs separately, this crowdfunding campaign aims to directly cover 50% of the overall costs of holding the Symposium, and providing free access for up to 75 people to attend the event.

The other 50% is being fundraised through fundraising activities happening in Brisbane and Perth Australia.
Our initial target is to raise $3,000 in funds we will use for:

Venue hire $500
Accommodation contribution $1,000  
Catering contribution $500
Transport costs including fuel $300
Translators (trilingual) contribution $700
TOTAL - $3,000

Our secondary goal is $5,000, with the additional $2,000 raised to be used for:

Remaining expenses contributions including Equipment hire ($200), materials including paper and stationary ($400), printing of participant information and resources ($400)
A participant handbook including text and photos of those who attended, the Symposium itself and information shared through the workshop program, cultural activities and discussions. 
Expanding the Cultural Program to include hire of a public bus for all participants to experience important locations around Negombo, while networking with local arts, cultural and community organisations    




About the Symposium

Building from 2012

The 2012 Venesa Matram Symposium was a significant event in many ways for Sri Lankan community workers. With over 50 people attending from all areas of the island, the event provided a space for people to not only network and learn about each others work, but also created multiple opportunities for participants to break down misconceptions and stigma barriers that make collaboration and networking difficult in Sri Lanka.
The second Symposium took place in Jaffna in 2014, hosted by Kaveri Kala Manram cultural organisation based in Chulipuram, near Jaffna. Again over 50 community workers and internationals participated in 6 days of sharing practice, culture, professional experiences and personal beliefs toward generating greater collaboration and understanding in the arts, cultural and community sectors in Sri Lanka.
Ferment Collaborate first developed the Symposium concept in 2012 following 18 months of engagement with practitioners from around Sri Lanka throughout 2010 and 2011. A regular event that could encourage active participation, build networks and strengthen local capacity and self confidence emerged as a key to building a stronger cultural development network in Sri Lanka.
The event, now in its third year, brings together community workers from a diverse range of specialisations, including health, education, agriculture, culture, creative arts, economic and community development and more. The Symposium is guided by a 5 year vision which aims to grow the event into an ongoing program and national network of creative community builders who acknowledge culture and place as being foundational to development.  




The program: A blend of Open Space, training and presentations
The Symposium uses a mix of curated programming (keynote and plenary discussions) and Open Space organising. Open Space is an organising tool that prioritises the skills and knowledge of participants as the basis for forming a conference or symposium program. By encouraging participants to engage with what skills, experiences and even questions about their work that they can share, and supporting them to host discussions or presentations by delivering facilitation training, the Symposium becomes a social change space not just in terms of its outcomes, but also through its delivery. Open Space empowers participants to understand the Symposium as a space for both learning and sharing.
The program is delivered to inspire community workers to recognise the value of their own knowledge and skills, while strengthening cross-sectoral networks and breaking down geographic, cultural and religious boundaries that have been reinforced through over 30 years of conflict and over 500 years of colonisation. We aim to create an event structure and space for Sri Lankan community workers to empower themselves and each other by supporting them to share their stories and skills, personal, professional and cultural, toward developing more effective, collaborative and inclusive networks and approaches to community development.
In keeping with this, the event’s program is based upon the use of Open Space Technology, a form of program organising that relies on the participants themselves to prepare and present workshops, discussions and presentations based on their own work or areas of their work they’d like to explore with other participants.
The program will include event production, documentation, workshop facilitation, non-violent communication and cultural development training (Days 1 and 2), the Open Space workshop program (Days 3, 4, 5 and 6), a cultural program (throughout) and a day to draw together outcomes, evaluate the event and strategise ongoing collaborations, projects and the next Symposium (Day 7). 





Building a platform for change
The Symposium is a significant opportunity to build stronger community development networks in Sri Lanka and for Australian community workers and the community development sector to contribute skills, experiences and resources to Sri Lankans. One of our major goals in facilitating the Symposium this year is to explore opportunities for networks, collaboration and shared projects beyond the Symposium, not just between Sri Lankan agencies, but also with Australian agencies and practitioners also.
The Symposium itself embodies the type of creative social change processes we support participants to deliver with their communities. We work with participants to create agreement to co-manage the event spaces so they are safe, inclusive, encouraging, collaborative and empowering.

The Young Producers Group
At the 2014 event we partnered with the Centre for Peace Building and Reconciliation (CPBR) who supported members of their Voice of Image (VOI) program for disadvantaged young people to attend . They became our Young Producers Group (YPG) and received dedicated training in event production, multimedia documentation and facilitation support. The group captured all photographs for the 2014 Symposium and a fresh group of young people will again be trained by us to help document and produce this years event. 





Cultural exchange
The Symposium also creates space for intercultural exchange, awareness raising and cross cultural collaboration opportunities.
The 2014 event featured a day tour of significant cultural locations around Jaffna, meeting local arts and cultural development practitioners, as well as a special 
""koothu"" or street theatre performance, sharing of dance and music techniques and discussions between participants who often have not collaborated professionally with community workers from different cultural backgrounds.

Ethiopia and Eritrea and have come to the Nakivale with dreams that they will
be resettled or be able to return home in the future. While Nakivale is usually safer
than where the refugees are coming from, it is still a hostile place and
resources are very scarce. </p>

<b><br/>PROJECT: Refugee Empowerment through Skills Training and Income Generating Activities<br/>___________________________________________________</b>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>While here I will be fundraising for and
co-coordinating a program that is designed to empower refugee women within the camp. The women will be given opportunities to learn new skills that can be used to generate an income and therefore  sustain a healthy livelihood.</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Desperation and poverty are stark realities in Nakivale for women. On average a refugee's situation can last up to 17 years and people must constantly devise different strategies to survive. Because
majority of the families in the camp are headed by single mothers, it is
usually the younger women's responsibility to go out and find food for
their families each day. It has been well </span>documented<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> in UNHCR reports that women often have little option but to use their bodies as part
of the sex industry to earn an income. Sadly, situations of human trafficking
and sexual exploitation are a daily part of refugee women’s life.</span></span></p>
<p></p>
<p>This project will empower women by offering options and alternative ways to earn an income. Women will be trained with the vocational skills needed to  make different crafts in the form of beaded purses, bags
and leather sandals. Project participants  will then take these items to be sold collectively at
regional markets and tourist centres in Western Uganda.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>TASAAGA will build on existing relationships
within the camp and collaborate with young women
whom participated in TASAAGA's annual KICK HIV/AIDS soccer tournament in
2014/13<br/></p>
<p><span>In addition, to ensure that the projects works towards reducing hostilities and enhancing unity
between the different nationalities living in the camp, TASAAGA will select a mixture of ethnic groups to join the program. </span></p>Once the program is established TASAAGA will look at expanding the skills training to include jewelry, clothing etc<p></p>

with computers for training Ugandan's youth. Throughout all of our work, we
promote healthy living, individual empowerment, and HIV/AIDS education.

(Me and TASAAGAS director Bruhan) 
Where we are working?__________________________________________________

We will
be working in Nakivale Refugee settlement camp which is the eighth largest
refugee settlement in the world and home to nearly 70,000 refugees. Nakivale is
Uganda’s oldest and largest refugee settlement. 
Refugee
families have been forced to flee violent conflicts and political
oppression  in neighboring countries Rwanda, Burundi, Congo, Somalia,
Ethiopia and Eritrea and have come to the Nakivale with dreams that they will
be resettled or be able to return home in the future. While Nakivale is usually safer
than where the refugees are coming from, it is still a hostile place and
resources are very scarce.

What are we doing? 


PROJECT: Refugee Empowerment through Skills Training and Income Generating Activities___________________________________________________



While here I will be fundraising for and
co-coordinating a program that is designed to empower refugee women within the camp. The women will be given opportunities to learn new skills that can be used to generate an income and therefore  sustain a healthy livelihood.
Desperation and poverty are stark realities in Nakivale for women. On average a refugee's situation can last up to 17 years and people must constantly devise different strategies to survive. Because
majority of the families in the camp are headed by single mothers, it is
usually the younger women's responsibility to go out and find food for
their families each day. It has been well documented in UNHCR reports that women often have little option but to use their bodies as part
of the sex industry to earn an income. Sadly, situations of human trafficking
and sexual exploitation are a daily part of refugee women’s life.

This project will empower women by offering options and alternative ways to earn an income. Women will be trained with the vocational skills needed to  make different crafts in the form of beaded purses, bags
and leather sandals. Project participants  will then take these items to be sold collectively at
regional markets and tourist centres in Western Uganda.  

TASAAGA will build on existing relationships
within the camp and collaborate with young women
whom participated in TASAAGA's annual KICK HIV/AIDS soccer tournament in
2014/13
In addition, to ensure that the projects works towards reducing hostilities and enhancing unity
between the different nationalities living in the camp, TASAAGA will select a mixture of ethnic groups to join the program. Once the program is established TASAAGA will look at expanding the skills training to include jewelry, clothing etc
(Leather Sandals the women will be trained to make) 
(Beaded Purse women will also learn how to make)
What We Need?___________________________________________________


We want to ensure that this program is successful and in order to do that we need your help. We need to raise $2,000 AUD by May 17 2015. Your donations will help us purchase:   Raw training materials to make bags, purses and sandals (Leather, beads, fabric, glue, string, tools etc)
1 x Sewing machine to sew purse and bag linings 
1 x Leather cutting machine for sandals 
1x Trainer (to show women how to make beaded purses and bags)
1 x Trainer (to make leather sandals) 
1 x Business skills consultant to teach the women about negotiating prices and targeting places to sell their finished products




The Impact___________________________________________________

With your help, refugees at Nakivale will have increased access to vocational, technical and business skills training. This will allow the refugees of Nakivale the opportunity to build their professional skills and ultimately build better lives for their families. It is also much more sustainable means than direct aid.  

Your donation will go directly into expanding, building and developing the implementation of project, Refugee Empowerment through Skills training & Income generating activities.

  Thank you for your donation!



Other Ways You Can Help___________________________________________________

The main activities would be the ball pit and jump house, with a side activity of face painting before/after the photo session. Music would be allowed as long as there is no profanity or explicit language. Outside approved food is allowed. (i.e. veggie trays, sandwich trays, pizza)

    Risks & Challenges  People value your transparency. Be open and stand out by providing insight into the risks and obstacles you may face on the way to achieving your goal.  If goal is not met through Indiegogo I will continue to save and raise funds through my online business. Either way Kandi Kreationz Eventz will come alive. :)
Some consumers may not agree with rules and guidelines, these can be changed and updated by customer feedback. The goal is to meet 100% customer satisfaction.
The first 3 months are always critical in business. If/When business becomes tough a different approach will be made, whether it be advertising or anything business savvy to help.

<p>As regular working professionals in the industry, we know all the challenges a production can face.  We want to provide studio space for any sized budget while keeping the same quality of those other high end studios.  It’s hard enough to break into the entertainment industry, and even harder to stay afloat.  We want to be able to share the wealth of knowledge we have learned with our peers and colleagues.  We both know the importance of having a home base that we can go to regularly, where our creativity is nurtured and encouraged.  We aim to become a one-stop-shop where you can find crew, special talent, or even equipment to give your production that special something to get completed.</p>
<p>Successfully funding this campaign will make our dreams a reality of opening up a studio where we can hold photo shoots, film shoots and professional audio sessions simultaneously.</p>

The Impact


In this moment of Planetary change, it is crucial that each individual contribute their unique attributes to the world. In order for there to be balance in society we must all take responsibility to find balance in ourselves, to activate our bodies and explore the vibrations that creates our existence. This process can be facilitated by finding tools and inspiration through others. Our goal is to provide individuals with a variety of tools to do so. In this way each individual can find a place to cocreate their ideal reality, where you can find who you truly are at your fullest potential. In this way we all come together, to heal, integrate and contribute to the process of connecting with the home that we all share, Planet Earth. 
We as individuals can cocreate a sustainable abundance and peaceful world!
We invite you to be part of this endeavor. Help us meet our goal. We believe there's no better time to start a Natural Healing Collective where we can all meet for the purpose of healing. We need you, we need each other and The Planet need us!

Risks & Challenges
  It may be a challenge to grow a significant amount of users to maintain the space with the necessary needed flow.    Having appropriate multi-platforms (website, word of mouth, press, collaborations and exchanges with local business) that can educate the public of our research and work.     Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but you can help us by:  Spreading the word through Facebook, Indiegogo or your preferred social media tool to make some noise about our campaingn.  Provide the service that you specialize in to help make it all work!!

</div></div>","Why Lyle Lovett Is Supporting MD Anderson
""My dad, William Pearce Lovett, was treated by Dr. Christopher Logothetis at MD Anderson in the late ’90s, so I have a deep personal respect and admiration for what MD Anderson does.  It’s incredible to see how devoted people are to MD Anderson and how much they care about one another. That’s essentially what it boils down to–people showing they love one another by supporting MD Anderson.""–Lyle Lovett

</div><div> <p></p>
<p>Leap's Sandcastle Contest began in 1983 and quickly became hugely popular. While the first 15
competitions were held at Aquatic Park in San Francisco, over the years the
Sandcastle Contest became so large that it was moved to the more expansive
Ocean Beach. Each year, thousands of spectators enjoy this unique competition
featuring 30 one-of-a-kind creations built in 400sq/ft plots along the beach. Teams
and sponsors involved in Leap's 2014 Sandcastle Contest raised over $262,000!
These funds make it possible for Leap to serve approximately 7,000 students in
over 25 schools across the Bay Area with hands-on learning experiences in the
arts. </p>
<p>Leap hosts this spirited competition between teams of architects, designers, contractors, corporations, engineers and local elementary school students each October on Ocean Beach. Before the event, teams meet with students in the classroom to develop ideas, shape clay models, and assign tasks, all in preparation for the big day. During the competition the teams and students have just four hours to create their castles, using nothing but sand and water, transforming the beach into a land of magical creatures and fantastical structures. The teamwork involved provides an intense learning experience for both the students and the many sponsors who participate. Through this event, Leap provides a unique opportunity to create a collaborative artwork to those who otherwise would not have access. 
</p>
<p>The event is free to the public and easily accessible. The contest will take place on October 10 between 10:30 am and 4:30 pm. The public is welcomed to the beach throughout the day. At the completion of the event the sand sculptures are returned to their natural state when the tides return the sand to the landscape.

in its 32nd year, Leap’s Sandcastle Contest is the
largest sand sculpture contest in Northern California. Every year Leap
orchestrates this spectacular competition as its major fundraising event,
helping to ensure that the organization can continue to keep the arts alive in
Bay Area schools. As part of the event, Leap organizes one Community Sandcastle
to be built on the spot by spectators and attendees of the competition. This gives
a hands-on opportunity for spectators to participate in the building of a sand
sculpture, making them an integral part of a unique art event.





In order to keep the Community Sandcastle tradition alive, we need your
support!

<span><p>CarPartner is a new revolutionary service that is designed
to empower car customers with new innovative services that will aim to alleviate
anxiety.  Buying a new car is either the
first or second largest investment a family can make.  And the process has been largely unchanged
since its inception.  CarPartner was
created by its founders Carey Gammon and Jermaine Brown to address this glaring
need that has been largely ignored.  Our
service aims to attract customers who are tired of the status quo, when they
have a need to purchase a new car.  They
are making a huge monetary investment and not receiving the expected level of
service that would warrant a happy customer experience.  CarPartner will enter into this space and
provide dealerships with a comprehensive plan to achieve a higher level of
customer experience.   Consumers who visit the CarPartner site prior
to visiting the dealership will have the ability to choose the sales person
they want deal with prior to visiting the dealership.  Once they have selected the sales person of their
choice our consumers will have several innovative features available.  These enhancements were designed to empower
the consumer with choices and options that were previously unavailable to car
buyers.  </p>
<p><b>About the Founders:</b></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Carey and Jermaine have been friends for over 17 years - originally
meeting in 1997 in the US Army while stationed in Panama. Both began their careers in the US Army in the Telecommunications field, however, it was Jermaine that remained in the
field upon exiting the service. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Jermaine

<p>Carey started his career in sales in 2002 as sales person at
First Team Auto Mall after exiting the service. 
After
spending his first three years in sales, he soon earned the opportunity to move
into management as a Finance Manager.  He ended up spending the majority
of his sales career on the retail side as a Finance Manager and in 2009 he
was promoted to Finance Director. In October of 2011, Carey decided to
explore the corporate side of the Automotive Industry as a District Sales Manager
for Hyundai Motor America.  Carey states
that ""all of these experiences provided me with a robust understanding of how
customers can be serviced better in the automotive industry"".  <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Thus Beyond Sales, LLC was born.  </span></p>

<br/><h3>Why Car Partner?</h3>
<p>Our goal is to revolutionize the way customers purchase their new cars, as well as how the dealerships will now interact with their customers.  Consumers have been buying cars in this country dating back to the 1890’s; and it was in 1896 that the first companies to produce vehicles for the public were formed.  As more consumers started to materialize these automobile dealerships began to market their vehicles to help increase sales.  This would lead to growth within the automotive infrastructure which forced dealerships to hire salesmen to service the public.  Over the past decades there have been many changes within the automotive industry, the vehicles have become more technically advanced, the dealerships have been upgraded to look more sophisticated and unique, marketing techniques have become more intuitive, even how you connect to a customer via phone, text, and email have made the car buying process easier for dealerships.  All these processes have either been added or upgraded over the years.  However, one of the most important areas of the purchase has yet to be addressed, and that area is the actual consumer.  Our service aims to address that void.  Consumers are the automotive industry’s greatest asset because without them there is no automotive industry.  We live in a society where our consumers deserve more.  CarPartner is designed to empower the automotive consumer while also providing an upgraded customer service experience.</p>

<h3>Your Contribution……</h3>
<p>By contributing to our campaign you will be intimately involved with helping us get our company and service up and running.  We want each person that contributes to our campaign to know that every dollar you give will be used to bring this innovative service to the public.  Our goal is to raise $500,000 to help cover costs for the design of the website, assist with marketing, operational costs, legal fees, travel costs and insurance.  Studies have shown that automotive customers are generally not satisfied with the current level of service they are receiving from dealerships.  With your help we can change how automotive customers buy their next car by empowering the consumer.  We hope to give our consumers this advantage going forward.  We hope you will join us in reaching our fundraising goal.  A simple donation can be made right here online!</p>

<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</span><br/>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>A risk and challenge with this service is that it's going against the grain, focusing on the people making the process work rather than the bottom-line pricing of an automobile.  Our intention is to align with dealerships to deliver better customer service which will lead to a better customer experience.  </p></li>
<li><p>Our economy dictates the frequency in which automobiles are purchased, as well as who has the ability to purchases them.  This could potentially have a negative affect on CarPartner.</p></li>
<li><p>Pricing is key to any automobile sale, but It’s more than just pricing that creates customer retention.  It’s the way the Sales professional and their team(s) work to provide the customer with a high quality customer service experience.  The dealership will be investing in our product and therefore investing in you, their customers!  Their focus will be on increasing customer retention by offering a better customer experience.</p></li>
<li><p>There are existing web-based platforms and applications selling vehicles, that currently use the existing processes of having the customer agree to being contacted.  The customer expects to get a knowledgeable, experienced and committed sales associate in order to complete the sale.

</div></div>","What is CarPartner?
CarPartner is a new revolutionary service that is designed
to empower car customers with new innovative services that will aim to alleviate
anxiety.  Buying a new car is either the
first or second largest investment a family can make.  And the process has been largely unchanged
since its inception.  CarPartner was
created by its founders Carey Gammon and Jermaine Brown to address this glaring
need that has been largely ignored.  Our
service aims to attract customers who are tired of the status quo, when they
have a need to purchase a new car.  They
are making a huge monetary investment and not receiving the expected level of
service that would warrant a happy customer experience.  CarPartner will enter into this space and
provide dealerships with a comprehensive plan to achieve a higher level of
customer experience.   Consumers who visit the CarPartner site prior
to visiting the dealership will have the ability to choose the sales person
they want deal with prior to visiting the dealership.  Once they have selected the sales person of their
choice our consumers will have several innovative features available.  These enhancements were designed to empower
the consumer with choices and options that were previously unavailable to car
buyers.  
About the Founders:
Carey and Jermaine have been friends for over 17 years - originally
meeting in 1997 in the US Army while stationed in Panama. Both began their careers in the US Army in the Telecommunications field, however, it was Jermaine that remained in the
field upon exiting the service. Jermaine
now touts 18 years of experience in the satellite communications
industry, with an emphasis on project management and engineering.  The bulk of this experience
coming from Intelsat, the global leader in satellite communications.  “I started my journey at Panamsat, a startup turned industry leader, and I was instilled with the drive and
passion to accomplish the goals at hand with the resources available”. He continued, ""I was fortunate to further my skills with Intelsat and the team there provided me with the means to hone my skill sets on several high-profile projects, programs and services"". Jermaine has been able to
translate his project management applications and process creation skills into
bringing a new customer experience service that will change the face of
automotive sales.

Carey started his career in sales in 2002 as sales person at
First Team Auto Mall after exiting the service. 
After
spending his first three years in sales, he soon earned the opportunity to move
into management as a Finance Manager.  He ended up spending the majority
of his sales career on the retail side as a Finance Manager and in 2009 he
was promoted to Finance Director. In October of 2011, Carey decided to
explore the corporate side of the Automotive Industry as a District Sales Manager
for Hyundai Motor America.  Carey states
that ""all of these experiences provided me with a robust understanding of how
customers can be serviced better in the automotive industry"".  Thus Beyond Sales, LLC was born.  



Beyond Sales is the company that will introduce CarPartner to the automotive industry. We are a modern innovative company that focuses on bridging the gap between consumers and car dealerships.   
The Questions……

Have you ever meet a car salesman that gave you outstanding customer service, however, when you went back to the dealership to purchase another vehicle or to give a referral, you found that he/she no longer works there?
Have you ever went to a dealership and before you could exit your vehicle there were 3-4 sales people standing around your car, just waiting to pounce as soon as you opened your door? 
Are you a first-time buyer or have anxiety when purchasing a car, with the expectation to be ""sweet-talked"" or pushed towards a vehicle that was not to your liking or expectations?

Risks & Challenges


A risk and challenge with this service is that it's going against the grain, focusing on the people making the process work rather than the bottom-line pricing of an automobile.  Our intention is to align with dealerships to deliver better customer service which will lead to a better customer experience.  
Our economy dictates the frequency in which automobiles are purchased, as well as who has the ability to purchases them.  This could potentially have a negative affect on CarPartner.
Pricing is key to any automobile sale, but It’s more than just pricing that creates customer retention.  It’s the way the Sales professional and their team(s) work to provide the customer with a high quality customer service experience.  The dealership will be investing in our product and therefore investing in you, their customers!  Their focus will be on increasing customer retention by offering a better customer experience.
There are existing web-based platforms and applications selling vehicles, that currently use the existing processes of having the customer agree to being contacted.  The customer expects to get a knowledgeable, experienced and committed sales associate in order to complete the sale.

<p>My name is Nick and I'm a 4th year university student at the University of Alberta. I'm currently studying English and German, and I'll transfer to Education after finishing my current degree in 2016. One day I'll be a teacher somewhere in this awesome world, and I hope to encourage students to think creatively and to inspire them to be the best they can be.</p>
<p>I have started this campaign in the hopes of funding a year of studying abroad in Germany at the Freie Universität Berlin, in order to better learn the language and learn about history, art, culture and people. I can't fully express what this would mean for me, other than by saying that I would be forever grateful, so let me introduce you to the German philosopher Gotthold Ephraim Lessing:</p>
<p><strong>""The best way to learn about art is to go and see it""</strong></p>
<p>Lessing was speaking of his voyage to Greece in 1765, during which time a massive revival of interest in Ancient Greece and Rome was under way, otherwise known as the Renaissance Period. Lessing traveled to see the legendary Laocoon statue in oder to view it first-hand, and later wrote his book ""Laocoon: An Essay on the Limits of Painting and Poetry.""</p>
<p>By funding my year of studies, you will help me to achieve this and more: I will be able to learn not from a textbook or from a professor's notes, but rather direct from the people and culture itself!</p> </div> <div> <h3>Let me be honest with you.</h3> <p>I need $5000. I've already saved a lot more ($10 000), but I'm still short on what the University deems an acceptable level of funds. And that's why I'm here! The funds will be used for the following: </p> <ul> <li>Airfare</li>
<li>Accommodation</li>
<li>Tuition</li>
<li>Textbooks</li>
<li>Food</li>
</ul>
<p>The most expensive and important thing, of course, is the tuition. </p>
<p>So far so good on paperwork though!</p>
<p>And let me assure you that should I not reach my goal the money will still be used for its intended purpose, but I will engage in a student loan to cover the difference.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Let's go back to Lessing. Had philosophers not engaged in novel thinking during the Enlightenment, there would have been no Renaissance, no Davinci, no Dante, no free thought, rare democracy. We owe our entire way of life to these enlightened thinkers! </p>
<p>Now, I'm not going so say that your donation will fund the next Plato's education. Although I've maintained a 3.3 GPA over my undergraduate career at the University of Alberta, I do still study diligently for exams. Life isn't easy and neither is an education. So at least you know that I will still work hard abroad to ensure nothing is put to waste!</p>
<p><strong>There are teachers all over the world, both good and bad</strong>. I've had my share of both and I've been determined to be a good one. <strong>Help me be the best I can be. Help me make a difference.</strong></p>

<p>Our goal is to <b>open our doors funded by direct support from the community</b>.  We need a total of $85,000 to be able to operate with full staffing on a part-time basis between now and January, 2016.

We all know that we can deal with polarizing conflict in our society and lives in a better way, and our clinic is here to provide the tools to accomplish that. Conflict can result in discouraging or even violent divisions between neighbors and families; but at its core, conflict is the place where we can recognize and embrace our differences and build agreements that serve all parties. What makes that difference is the level of support parties receive in the process of conflict and resolving conflict.  We provide that support, in collaboration with many other social service and government agencies that also offer support.  </p>
<p>Our directors, staff, and advisors have the combination of knowhow and care for our community to make this a reality.  Erin Noel, who will serve as the first Facilitating Director of the center, is an 15-year attorney and mediator who has worked in the non-profit sector and for individual clients.  Her practice has included environmental, land use, property, landlord/tenant law and dispute resolution, as well as legislative drafting, community organizing, and mediation. Her volunteer experience ranges from serving on and mediating with the Conflict Resolution Center board of directors (CRC provides volunteer mediation in the Nevada County Superior Court), volunteering for the Hospitality House, volunteering for organizations ranging from the San Juan Ridge Taxpayers Association to the South Yuba River Citizen's League, and serving as a founding member and board member for organizations including the Sierra Nevada Alliance and Sierra Nevada Forest Protection Campaign.  She presently provides free legal service in a monthly legal clinic in North San Juan, with other volunteer attorneys.</p>
<p>Board members include Paul Johnson, President, a local attorney who has worked in various role serving the public, including his current role as attorney for DCSS, and previous work in criminal defense, dependency and juvenile law, serving small public agencies in water rights and environmental issues, and a past member of the Executive Committee of the Nevada County Bar Association;  Serge Aronow, former Director of Family Court Mediation Services; and  Monica Senter, trained as an attorney, who now provides project management and contract management services for Wells Fargo Bank. </p>
<p>Advisors include Judge Carl Bryan (ret.), and Judge Albert Dover (ret.), former Judges of the Nevada County Superior Court. Judge Dover is an accomplished mediator now in private practice; Joseph Bell, the attorney who ran Nevada County Legal aid starting in the early 1980s, and who has served on a number of State Bar committees; Kimberly Milligan, an inactive attorney who, when active, worked representing victims of domestic violence, and contributed to CA. Judicial Council policies in this area. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">She presently serves on the Board of Directors of American Rivers; Dr. Irving Baran, a psychiatrist who served as a psychiatrist for Yuba County Behavioral Health Services, and Caleb Dardick, Executive Director of the South Yuba River Citizens League.  </span></p>

</div> <div> <h3>Starting a new organization is risky business; we need your support to address this challenging gap in service. </h3> <p>Simply put, we are working toward creating a new organization and a new way of providing legal services.  We are taking this approach because we really do not have legal service that is affordable to low income people in Nevada County. Creating a new approach is inherently risky.  Part of our model is that community support is critical to a collaborative approach.  The support of our community, not only as funders but as partners, reduces risk and allows us the support needed to take the risks we need to take to really make change and to make a difference in the lives of people we serve.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Because we have support from a wide range of leaders both in our legal community, local government, and in mediation practice, we have the collective wisdom to create something that meets our high standards in each practice area. </span></p>

<p>Our staff and board have organizing, legal, and mediation experience needed to be successful at this stage of organizational development.  And, we are people who are deeply connected to this community.  </p>
<p>That said, our biggest strategy for addressing the inherent risks and strategies in this endeavor is to really listen to feedback, and to be open to whatever outcome seems needed.  We have a clear sense of the needs that we want to meet, but we want to know from you whether you share the sense that we are on the right path.  Your funding is a way of communicating your support in a way that has meaning in our society, that speaks volumes to other potential funders, and that will get us off the ground knowing that the community has our back. </p>

here in America.</p>
<p>This amazing process will all work once our  campaign is

 stretch goal items.  We will also be able to add additional partner schools and accelerate the 
introduction of the other products from us.

There are lots of reasons why you should help us reach our goals, but let’s start with these:
1. Clothing with a PURPOSE.
 Locally made. Globally inspired. As part of Yebies University, our 
collegiate-themed clothing helps provide educational experience projects
 including playgrounds, sports and art equipment, technologically 
advanced resources and more to 
the students attending our domestic and foreign partner schools.

2. 100% Made in America. Our products are designed and crafted in the U.S. by our team and associates. 
3. Authentic. By making our clothing here, we can create clothing that is created and inspired by those of our local community and our supporters. 
4. Inclusive.
 We want you to join our story! By owning YU Clothing, you become a 
model for philanthropy and social development. By 
wearing our collegiate-themed clothing, you demonstrate your commitment 
to and value for educational advancement. 
5. Fair Trade. When you buy
 anything from us, you are not just buying a product - you are buying 
into a better world. YU respects and follows the principles of the fair 
trade movement. Through YU, we at YEBies have
 pledged to help reach The 8 Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations.






YU Clothing:

 
Starting with the YU “Campus Basics” which
 includes t-shirts, crewnecks sweatshirts, hoodies, and accessories, YU 
offers our personal take on traditional collegiate  apparel that spreads the feeling of solidarity and 
uniqueness fostered by the university experience. Each piece of clothing
 is made with the goal of uplifting young scholars across the globe.
Consumer Involvement:
Other companies try to guess what their customers want – we let you 
decide. After our initial run, we’ll design subsequent collections based 
on what you want. Your input will be used on what ultimately gets 
produced.


Why Indiegogo?For those of you 
not familiar with Indiegogo, this campaign is not just about 
contributing money to a great product and cause; rather, you will be 
joining us on our journey of social entrepreneurship! Based in 
Washington D.C., our team is currently made up of local residents who 
truly enjoy creating a locally made and globally conscious product. 
Living as citizens of the global 
community, we are moved and empowered by helping people who want to 
study and work their way out of their current conditions. Our clothing 
collections impact the lives of students at our partner schools and communities, and
 provide employment for local residents. By supporting 
us, you're helping to spread the message that education, along with 
social entrepreneurship are keys to global, economic and societal 
development.

How We Work:











The Breakdown:
When we've raised $10K,  we will launch new projects at our partner schools and start planning for the project in Liberia. Our “YU Campus Basics” will go live on our website.
At $25K,
 we will be able to  add two additional schools and projects. The next to cities for projects will be Baltimore, Md and Atlanta, GA. We will also add other colorway options and kids sizes of our campus basics. 
At $50K, we will be 
able to hire more staff and begin the production of our next collection which you will help create.
 We will also be able to give every backer a YU tank top which will be 
released to the general public in the spring/summer of 2015.

<p>Candid Rouge Beauty Apothecary is an all natural cosmetic company that focuses on optimal color blending for all skin tones with dedicated research for the most suitable ingredients.  My products are made with ingredients that are nourishing for all skin types and are skin tone adjusting to enhance any complexion.  Some of my favorite ingredients include:</p>
<p>~Carrot Oil - provides skin protection and helps to repair prior damage.</p>
<p>~Jojoba Oil -  helps regulate oil production and reduces inflammation.</p>
<p>~Neem Extract - reduces bacteria and fungi that can build up and lead to blemishes.</p>
<p>My color blending technique utilizes color theory, skin shades, and knowledge of undertones.  With these factors in mind, we are able to create beautiful colors that brighten the skin and adjust for any complexion.</p>
<p>Candid Rouge Beauty Apothecary was created to bridge the gap between natural cosmetics and all complexions.  As an esthetician and makeup artist for the past seven years, I have noticed that affordable natural cosmetic lines that contain beneficial ingredients for the skin do not include all skin tones.  Lighter and darker complexions are often left out.  Tans, olives, and deeper complexions can result in an unnatural color due to the usage of a ruddy or pink undertone. </p>
<p>I have dreamed of having my own cosmetic line since I was thirteen. I have developed knowledge and experience dedicated to making that dream come true.  I have put careful research into everything from the ingredients to the name of the company so that my experience and my passion can shine through my products.</p>
<p>I am currently utilizing Etsy.com, and in the past 30 days have noticed an increase in awareness and sales.  I have recently been approached by a few salon and boutique owners interested in displaying my products at their locations.  I have a solid foundation.  Your donation will help me to get to the next level by boosting my online sales and placing phenomenal cosmetics into these salons and boutiques. </p> </div> <div> <h3></h3>

<p>I have invested around $1000 to get my company started and I am at a great point.  This is why I am only looking to raise a low amount. The $1000 I have invested went toward research and development, inventory, and general start up costs. </p>
<p>Currently inventory is at a minimum (which keeps the products fresh), but with the increase in sales and awareness coming swiftly, I need to produce more inventory to keep up with demand.  With the sales coming in, I know where the current demand is and can appropriate funds accordingly.  With my company growing rapidly, I also need to invest in some proprietaries to protect my investment. </p>
<p>My first priority is the proprietaries then I will start adding to my current inventory as currently I am able to keep up with demand.  </p>

<p> At the beginning of the year, Candid Rouge plans to start expanding to a full cosmetic line that will also include skin care, aromatherapy, and some jewelry pieces.  I will create a new product schedule based on the company needs and the requests of my existing customers.</p>

~$445 will be used to invest in inventory 
~$55 will be used for copyrighting
I have invested around $1000 to get my company started and I am at a great point.  This is why I am only looking to raise a low amount. The $1000 I have invested went toward research and development, inventory, and general start up costs. 
Currently inventory is at a minimum (which keeps the products fresh), but with the increase in sales and awareness coming swiftly, I need to produce more inventory to keep up with demand.  With the sales coming in, I know where the current demand is and can appropriate funds accordingly.  With my company growing rapidly, I also need to invest in some proprietaries to protect my investment. 
My first priority is the proprietaries then I will start adding to my current inventory as currently I am able to keep up with demand.  



!!!PERKS!!!
I will be offering perks for donations of $1, $5, $10, $25, $50, $100.
I am ever grateful all donations to my campaign .  I have perks including coupons, samplers, and full size kits.  Please view the perks sections to see full details. See below for perk options.  I know you will be pleased with what I have to offer!
Candid Rouge Beauty Apothecary has had a great start. I have seen a 65% increase in sales in the last 30 days and am on track to do more in the next month.  Candid Rouge is starting with a small collection of products to create the perfect face and two aromatherapy products.  These products include: stick foundation, which can also be used as a concealer, mineral powder foundation that is infused for added nourishment, color sticks for eyes, cheeks, and lips, blush color, lip balms for chapped lips, Himalayan salt scrubs for face and body, and herbal sachets to soothe and relax in the bath. 
 At the beginning of the year, Candid Rouge plans to start expanding to a full cosmetic line that will also include skin care, aromatherapy, and some jewelry pieces.  I will create a new product schedule based on the company needs and the requests of my existing customers.




    Other Ways You Can Help I understand that not everybody that views my campaign will be able to donate.  No worries!  There are other ways you contribute to help.

<p>Who We Are:</p>
<p>Wayne and Maggi, founders of Jones LLC, are parents of three
and grandparents of seven.  They saw the
need to secure their home.  They explored
various avenues of gun security and in doing so they realized cost was a major
factor stopping many from securing their guns. 
Most options were too expensive and were not reliable.</p>
<p>Wayne and Maggi became determined to remove this
barrier.  With over 40 year of experience
converting metal products to plastic, they developed a low-cost, reliable gun
case.  Cost and reliability are no longer
reasons to carelessly leave your home-defense weapon unsecure, exposing your
family to needless harm associated with the curiosity of the innocent.</p>

<p><u>FAQ:</u></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Q.  What makes Artemis DIFFERENT from cases
currently on the market?</p>
<p>A. 1. 
Artemis is made to protect the INNOCENT from the gun  -- Not the GUN
from an INTRUDER.  I feel this is the
reason they call their cases saves or vaults. 
Artemis is a child-resistant case.  If an adult takes a screwdriver to the existing metal cases now on the market, an adult can break into it.</p>
<p>2.  It is the only case on the market
with a fingerprint scanner that works for under $170.00.  The “Second Touch Scanner” technology is
unique, reliable and simple to program and operate and specifically developed,
by Jones LLC, for use in a gun case.  On
this site, until the limit has been reached, you can purchase an Artemis case
for $79.00.  Considerably less than half
of the price of the next semi-reliable, “gun safe” on the market.  The “Second Touch Scanner” alone costs the
manufacture more than half of this cost.</p>
<p>3.  Artemis is made of polycarbonate, an
engineering polymer that the plastics industry classifies as unbreakable.  This polymer makes Artemis very child-resistant
yet affordable.  The bumper on your car
is plastic.  In many instances, plastic
is superior to metal.</p>
<p>Q.  Is Artemis powered only by batteries or can it be plugged in?</p>
<p>A.  Only batteries.  However, it will make a sound similar to a smoke alarm when the batteries need to be replaced.  Once a year replacement is sufficient. </p>
<p>Q.  Which guns can fit in the case?</p>
<p>A.  Most weapons designed for concealed
carry and sub-compact pistols will fit comfortably inside the Artemis case as
well as a limited amount of additional storage capacity.</p>
<p>Most model 1911 handguns will fit well. </p>
<p></p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>Q.  Can the case be factory re-set to delete previously stored
fingerprints?</p>
<p> A.  Yes. The
case is equipped with a factory reset button on the inside that can only be
used once access is granted into the case.</p>
<p>Q.  Is it water and fire proof?</p>
<p> A.  No.
Artemis case is designed to provide a secure way to house your gun from curious
hands. It is designed to be a low-cost secure alternative to bulky, expensive
competitor versions.</p>
<p>Q.  Does it come in any other sizes, colors, etc.?</p>
<p> A.  Not yet.
Our intention is to provide different sizes in the future to fit all of your
personal needs for securing firearms such as a case for a purse or travel, rifles
and shotguns.  </p>
<p>Q.  Will the case be available for purchase at brick and mortar
stores?</p>
<p>A.  Not at first. To start the Artemis case is only available online
in order to keep the price low, which will allow it to be available to anyone.</p>
<p>Q.  Who is the case for?</p>
<p>A.  Artemis
is designed for anyone who wants to protect themselves while protecting the
innocent.</p>

<p>Blue Bridal Studio will not only be a bridal boutique offering amazingly modern, beautiful gowns and accessories for brides, in an intimate setting, who seek to display their own personal style on their wedding day. It will also fulfill the creative nature of the little girl inside me who never stop urging me to step forward and do what truly makes my heart happy.</p>
<p>Blue Bridal Studio will offer joy, excitement, beauty, creativity, challenges and require hard work, however, it will be a literal example of who I am and what I can do when focused and determined. I am committed to the success of this venture and I am more than grateful that you are willing to join me on this journey. Each and every contributor will be a brick needed to build a solid foundation on which to start this business venture. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Need</h3>
<p>Through the process of educating myself to what is required in starting and operating a bridal boutique, I was presented with the challenge of having to purchase all of the sample inventory upfront. This includes all of the gowns and accessories that will be offered for sale in my boutique. This process is unlike a regular speciality clothing boutique. </p>
<p>I have selected three outstanding wedding dress designers and two amazing bridal accessory designers that will represent my vision and be sold at Blue Bridal Studio. It has been a strategic, pain staking, well-thought out decision for the collaboration of sample gowns and accessories. To make the initial buy in, $25,000 will be needed. Your contribution will go <strong>DIRECTLY</strong> to the purchasing of the sample inventory. </p>
<h3>The Perks</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lace Lovers. Your contribution of $25 or more will garner a heartfelt thank you letter in writing as well as name recognition on Blue Bridal Studio official website under <b>Dream Makers</b>.</li>
<li>Sophisticated Sweetheart. Your contribution of $50 or more will garner a heartfelt thank you letter in writing, name recognition on the Blue Bridal Studio official website under <b>Dream Makers</b> as well as a one time use transferrable discount of $10 off $200 or more purchase.</li>
<li>Marvelous Mermaid. Your contribution of $75 or more will garner a heartfelt thank you letter in writing, name recognition on the Blue Bridal Studio official website under <strong>Dream Makers </strong>as well as a one time use transferrable discount of $20 off $400 or more purchase.</li>
<li>Bold &amp; Beautiful Ballgown. Your contribution of $100 or more will garner a heartfelt thank you letter in writing, name recognition on the Blue Bridal Studio official website under <strong>Dream Makers</strong> as well as a one time use transferrable discount of $40 off $800 or more purchase. *Additional perks will be added during the campaign.*</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Blue Bridal Studio will be operating in Alabaster, Alabama and according to my research there are no operating bridal boutiques in Shelby County. This is a promising attribute in the success of my boutique and the ability to offer elegant, sophisticated wedding gowns to soon-to-be brides in Shelby County and the surrounding areas.</p>
<p>By nature, I am a hardworking, dedicated and highly determined individual and anyone and everyone who knows me can attest to that. I say that to say this, your contribution of any amount will not be taken in vain and please know that the success of this venture is my highest priority. I wouldn't want to take this journey with the backing of your contribution without assuring all of you of my goal.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>There is an understanding that not everyone will be able to make a contribution, however, <strong>EVERYONE</strong> can make noise and share this campaign with any and everyone that you feel can and will be able to contribute.  Whatever your contribution to my cause will be, I am eternally grateful to each and everyone of you for your love and support. </p>

<h3>Hello, I'm Carrie</h3>
<p>I've been in the veterinary world for 18 years. I'm a certified veterinary technician (aka nurse for animals), and spent the last 13 years working with cats only. In that time I had a chance to see how valuable cats are to peoples lives and how they can be over looked by most of the market. Cats are different! I want to help bridge the misunderstandings and help people and cats! </p>
<p>That is how the idea of Hip Justice Catmunity Center came to be! What better way to help people understand and bond with cat than to have a location with cats looking for people and people looking for love and healing cats can bring!

</div><div>
<h3>I need your help</h3>
<p>In order to secure a rental location financial stability must be shown (aka money in the bank!). The cost of down payments, building out, furnishing and insurance will be plenty and I have secured some privet investors, but any start up takes a lot to make it successful.  To give you an idea of what is need here's a few numbers!</p>

<h3>Introduction - The Party</h3>
<p><strong>Convergenza Socialista (‘Socialist Convergence’ in English) is a new socialist political Party of Italy which is growing and needs your help to achieve precise political goals. We deeply think that socialism is the future of humanity. Convergenza Socialista was founded on April 4<sup>th</sup> 2015, with headquarter in Rome.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What We Can Do With Your Support</strong></h3>
<p>Thanks to your help we plan to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open a new headquarter in Rome. We aim at renting a new office space.</li>
<li>Expand our reach by opening several branches in Italy. Also in this case, we aim at renting new office spaces.</li>
<li>Open our official newspaper. At first online but with your support we might be able to print copies in a systematic way.</li>
<li>Start our school for socialist studies and have lectures in Rome and through the internet. We will use our YouTube channel. Further goal would be to have lectures in other cities throughout Italy. Your support will help us sustain all organization expenses.</li>
<li>Launch political events to promote the visibility and the growth of the Party. Organize political events in cities and towns, produce advertisement for regional and national newspapers and televisions.</li>
<li>Launch social campaign to help difficult situation like sustain local schools with equipment, materials for educational activities.</li>
<li>Cover travel expenses, in Europe and around the world. To begin with, your support will help us cover the expenses for the V Congress of the European Left Party, from the 16<sup>th</sup> to the 18<sup>th</sup> of December 2016 to which we have been invited.</li>
<li>Organize international meeting with the partecipation of socialist political parties and movements. Your support will help us achieve the goal to build connections, construct bridges for the internationalization of socialism.</li>
<li>Organize the ‘Festivity of Convergenza Socialista’, starting from 2017. It is a weekend long meeting during which we will involve people, talk about socialism with its policies, struggles and hopes.</li>
<li>Bring forward those left behind. You can be part of our political mission around the world.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Why we need your support</strong></h3>
<p>We do not get any money from the central or local Governments. The only way for us to finance our political activities, in Italy and internationally, is through the support of men and women from all over the world who believe in socialism and socialist policies. Men and women who believe in our action to tackle problems seriously and find the right answers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Our international connections</strong></p>
<p>In Europe we have applied for membership to the Party of the European Left, and internationally we follow with great attention all political processes in North America and Latin-America. In particular, the work done by 'Socialist Convergence’ (USA) started in Philadelphia last July and the work done within the Foro de Sao Paulo, and the ELAP -Ecuador (Encuentro Latinoamericano Progresista).  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>State of the art in the world </strong></p>
<p>We could say that, today, we are struggling against political financial dictatorships whose selfish implications are in constant acceleration.</p>
<p>It has been clear since the last subprime mortgage crisis how the world was under attack from a small but powerful financial élite which greatly influences politics and, using accommodating politics, shapes economic and social policies towards wilder, antisocial forms which have as their core more widespread privatization and accelerating sale of public properties.</p>
<p><strong>The struggle today is between the people and the élite. The 99% against the 1%.</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475686677/antmlglncniupw9cts3g.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The 99% made up of men and women, the peoples of the world, segregated in a national context with national policies and, therefore, localized. The 99 % of the population. The 1 %, instead, made up of the richest with enormous access of big capital whose globalization of banking and financial processes has produced a transnational convergence able to regulate itself, bypassing the various national rules and weak international rules. The remaining 1%.</p>
<p><strong>62 people own as much as the poorest half of the world's population.</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475687184/whs6v2gq6cfokcwhl4bp.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Socialism is strategic planning which must expand to be truly effective and to have a real grip in terms of balance of power, in a world irreversibly globalized by the neoliberal system. If the neoliberal doctrine has succeeded in becoming dominant in the whole world, democratic socialism must do the same to have the opportunity to be the political and economic alternative.</p>
<p>Meetings between organizations, political movements and political Parties are, therefore, very important at both national and international level since they lays the foundation for clear socialist platforms. It is, then, necessary to help and to contribute to the growth of organizations and international meetings such as the Party of the European Left, ELAP, Foro de Sao Paulo, ‘Socialist Convergence’ in USA and '<strong>Convergenza Socialista</strong>' in Italy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Our way forward</strong></p>
<p>We must, nevertheless, make an extra effort. We must converge on a common political platform with the purpose to revive socialism at a global scale.</p>
<p><strong>Carry your world under your arm.</strong></p>

<p>We have in mind a sort of coordination at a global level for the organization of an annual meeting, rotating in each of the continents, which will allow all of us to proceed quickly towards the internationalism of socialism, with the creation of working committees having the goal to sharpen our socialist policies. Policies alternative to the ones developed in the meetings of the globalized élite.</p>
<p>Today the balance of power between the neoliberal and the socialist camp is very unbalanced . And this is due to the fragmentation within national boundaries, in some cases continental boundaries, of the socialist, progressive and leftist organizations which must confront a neoliberal power which has developed a clear, homogeneous and globalized political and economic platform. We, instead, are untied , politically heterogeneous, and we think it’s time to start our own process of homogenization of socialism, on global scale, on few political points.</p>
<p>Our own proposal on the world. The ‘<strong>globalization of socialism</strong>’. Proposal which should move along <strong>four strategic directions</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>On the economic front</strong>, we have to reverse course regarding the massive privatizations which in the last decades have caused enormous damage around the world. Whatever is of public interest shall be public. We are referring to natural resources, basic services including the banking system.</p>
<p>Nationalization must be a political point back to the table of worldwide economic platform. Another aspect regards the monetary policy that shall be restored as a ‘public service’, managed by a public entity. Not certainly managed by private Central Banks.</p>
<p><strong>On the social front</strong>, full and fair redistribution of wealth.</p>
<p><strong>On the political front</strong>, improve the quality of democracies by expanding representativeness, involvement, participation of the people of all social classes. Not marginalize anyone, not leaving anyone behind.</p>
<p><strong>On the mass media/information front</strong>. The fourth issue has to do with the enormous and accelerating concentration of information in few hands which distorts the truth, often falsifies it, for special interests. It is a global issue that must be treated globally.</p>
<p>It is clear, therefore, the need for a broad internationalism of socialism which must serve the people of the world on a specific political and economic alternative platform to be able to fight politically the globalized neoliberal system. </p>

L’Echange, c’est un service gratuit et anonyme, implanté dans le centre-ville de Namur depuis
2009 et spécialisé en assuétude. L'objectif est d’offrir aux usagers de drogues, un accès à divers services d’aide dans le respect et le non-jugement. L'équipe est à leur écoute, peut les orienter selon leurs demandes et leurs besoins, les aider à se remettre en ordre socialement ou encore leur permettre l’accès aux soins de santé.                                                                                                                                                         

Notre but


Actuellement, il est difficile pour une ASBL comme la nôtre de trouver des financements. Le concept de « réduction des risques » est encore souvent
controversé car peu connu.
Afin d’offrir un accueil agréable et digne aux personnes fréquentant L’Echange, nous souhaiterions pouvoir proposer un peu plus de confort et offrir des services et de la nourriture de meilleures qualités, dans le respect de la dignité humaine.
Ainsi, vous participeriez, d’une part, à l’amélioration de la qualité de vie de ces personnes et d’autre part à la promotion d’un monde plus éthique et plus respectueux de l‘environnement.

En soutenant notre projet, vous nous donnez la possibilité de proposer : 



Un an de fruits biologiques et locaux (pour 1000€ atteints)
Lorsqu’on vit en rue et que l’on souffre d’addiction, il est compliqué d’avoir une alimentation équilibrée et cela a des effets négatifs sur le corps et sur le moral. De ce fait, nous souhaiterions proposer des fruits, lors de nos permanences, issue d’une agriculture locale et durable.


Un an de café issue du commerce équitable (pour 1500€ atteints)
Nous offrons déjà du café lors de nos permanences. Cependant,
proposer un café respectueux de l’environnement et des travailleurs serait un véritable plus. 


Un accès aux transports en commun (pour 2000€ atteints)
Les distances à parcourir sont souvent un frein pour la réalisation des différentes démarches et à la réinsertion des personnes vivant en rue ou dans des conditions précaires. C’est pourquoi nous aimerions proposer des cartes de bus afin qu’ils puissent se déplacer plus aisément.


Une pharmacie de première nécessité (pour 2500€ atteints)
L’accessibilité aux soins est pour nous une priorité. Pour ce faire, nous avons besoin de fonds pour remplir notre pharmacie.


Des fonds propres pour pallier à d’éventuelles difficultés
L’argent supplémentaire constituerait une réserve en cas de coup dur.

<p>Les Gueux,
ce sont deux passionnés de bières qui désirent créer des bières de spécialité
uniques sur le marché. Pourquoi Les Gueux? Parce que nous sommes des brasseurs
itinérants et que nous faisons appel à la solidarité de ceux qui aiment autant
la bière que nous.  Notre premier
objectif est de faire rayonner notre expertise en collaborant avec nos amis artisans du
milieu  brassicole.</p>
<p>La phase initiale de notre projet consiste à concocter des recettes collaboratives avec des
microbrasseries pour donner la chance aux
amateurs de bières de goûter à ce que nous faisons. Par la suite, à moyen
terme, nous allons établir un chai afin d'y faire fermenter et maturer nos bières.</p>

qu'une minime fraction des coûts nécessaires à l'établissement d'une brasserie

nous servira à élaborer nos recettes et produits de façon rigoureuse. Ces fonds nous serviront également à assurer un

une capsuleuse, une étiquetteuse, une cuve de conditionnement, etc. À plus long
terme, nous envisageons même effectuer la majeure partie du chauffage et de la
climatisation par géothermie! Mais comme le dit notre slogan: une barrique à la

<p>Les Gueux (The Hobos) is a couple of people who are

Quebec. Why Hobos? Because we are itinerant brewers and we call upon the
solidarity of those who are as passionate as we are. <br/>
<br/>
Our initial objective is to display our expertise through collaborative brews

to establish a cellar where we can ferment and barrel age our beers.</p>
<p>The Hobos are Andrée-Anne Partridge and Samuel
Landry. She is a bachelor in business management, will oversee all operations
and let’s face it: she’s the brains of it all. Now the brawns: He is a brewer
for more than 20 years, one part mad scientist and one part simple farmer; he

Qui ça? Quoi ça?

Les Gueux,
ce sont deux passionnés de bières qui désirent créer des bières de spécialité
uniques sur le marché. Pourquoi Les Gueux? Parce que nous sommes des brasseurs
itinérants et que nous faisons appel à la solidarité de ceux qui aiment autant
la bière que nous.  Notre premier
objectif est de faire rayonner notre expertise en collaborant avec nos amis artisans du
milieu  brassicole.
La phase initiale de notre projet consiste à concocter des recettes collaboratives avec des
microbrasseries pour donner la chance aux
amateurs de bières de goûter à ce que nous faisons. Par la suite, à moyen
terme, nous allons établir un chai afin d'y faire fermenter et maturer nos bières.
Les Gueux ce
sont aussi Andrée-Anne Partridge et Samuel Landry. Elle détentrice d’un
baccalauréat en administration, gestionnaire et cerveau des opérations. Lui, brasseur depuis près de 20 ans, créateur d’idées folles et visionnaire.

Comment on va faire ça? 



Tout d'abord
ça va où 20 000$? Ça peut sembler beaucoup d'argent mais ça ne représente
qu'une minime fraction des coûts nécessaires à l'établissement d'une brasserie
professionnelle. Nous souhaitons acquérir un système de brassage pilote qui
nous servira à élaborer nos recettes et produits de façon rigoureuse. Ces fonds nous serviront également à assurer un
minimum d'autonomie lors de notre première année d'existence. Dans le détail:




7 500$ - Système
de brassage pilote/petite échelle


5 500$ -
Fermenteurs, fûts et quincaillerie diverse


4 000$ -
Achat de barriques et matériel d'entrepôt et de manutention


3 000$ - Frais
administratifs, notariat, enregistrements, permis, etc.




Si jamais
nous n'atteignons pas notre objectif lors de cette campagne, l'emphase sera
mise sur les investissements cruciaux tels l'administration et les coûts de
départ ainsi que l'acquisition d'un système de brassage pilote. Le reste peut s'ajouter à nos immobilisations dans le
futur. 
Si (et nous
préférons grandement cette éventualité!) nous dépassons les objectifs de cette

l'établissement d'un chai digne de ce nom: un koelschip, un chariot-élévateur,
une capsuleuse, une étiquetteuse, une cuve de conditionnement, etc. À plus long
terme, nous envisageons même effectuer la majeure partie du chauffage et de la
climatisation par géothermie! Mais comme le dit notre slogan: une barrique à la

consecration extends over the course of two days, including food and lodging
(if necessary). Take part in the selection of barrels and the blending of a product
that took years to see the light of day and may very well keep for many years
once in the bottle. The direct and sensorial experience of a blending session
has no equivalent; it will improve and complement even the greatest sommelier’s
knowledge. You will also obtain a Mathusalem (6L) of our first vintage beer! 
What's in the barrel for the future?
As a small business, we wish to bring green and
enduring practices to this industry so as to ensure the well-being of future
generations. We wish to establish a know-how all local and bring an intimate
notion of terroir into the world of beer. Sharing our passion one barrel at a
time, that’s our goal, so that scale matters very little but quality and
character is always at the forefront. Without contributors, much of our dream
will hit the drain… Your contributions will help us establish sound and solid bases
to build a local brewery that can fulfill your palates.
Other ways to help us
You’re not in a position to contribute financially
to our project? You can still help! Share, like, talk, tell everyone how much
you wish to see our craftsmanship see the light of day. You only have to click

and that the average American is unfamiliar with the origin of their food. We also know fresh, organically grown foods are often too expensive for many people. This is a story of a community of farmers, ranchers, and chefs in Western Colorado actively building their local food economy for everyone to enjoy.The average age of farmers in the United States is 58 years, but there is a rapidly expanding interest and action among the millennial generation in local farming throughout the country. According to a report from the National Young Farmers' Coalition, communities can lead the change by: • Expanding Marketing Opportunities• Revising zoning to protect farmland from development• Supporting local farms through purchasing choicesOur community has one of the highest levels of income inequality in the nation, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. And yet it is truly unique in its support of farmers with everything from educational opportunities in gardening and market farming through FAT CITY FARMERS, to zero-interest loan programs like 2 FORKS CLUB, the only non-profit club under SLOW MONEY which invests in the careers of beginning farmers. This is an epic food movie for a new generation.OUR TEAMWe are Haley Thompson and Tomas Zuccareno, long-time locals of the Roaring Fork Valley inspired to document this powerful food movement and the people behind it. From Haley: This film is something I've long been inspired to do after getting to know the many farmers, ranchers, chefs and educators my father Michael Thompson, has worked with over the years. I am biased in this sense, but anyone who visits our community and has tasted the many foods of this Valley, knows this story is one to be shared.From Tomas: I am most inspired by how dedicated the young farmers are to bringing great tasting, healthy, sustainably produced food to their community. They are leading the charge in the local food movement, reconnecting us to our food. As a journalist, I can't help but want to tell that story.GIFT ECONOMYAll donations towards this film are TAX-DEDUCTIBLE through our fiscal non-profit sponsor, FAT CITY FARMERS. By supporting this film, you are also investing in the famers and ranchers of our community. Many of our gifts, as a thank you for your donation, will be sourced locally from the Roaring Fork Valley. Examples include signed copies of Jerome Ostentowski's Permaculture Handbook, The Forest Garden Greenhouse, as well as local seed packets and beautiful products from our friends at Dynamic Roots, to name a few.Our goal is to complete the film by Summer of 2017, but in order to do so we need to raise at least $35,000. While this will only cover a portion of our total film budget, it will help to cover some of the production costs including but not limited to: renting additional equipment, music licensing, motion graphics, Indiegogo platform fees, audio mixing, color correction, etc. The following diagram shows where the donated funds will be disbursed:YOUR IMPACTYou have the power to make a difference. Not only by helping to fund this project but also in your own community. By supporting local farms over corporate food suppliers, you are investing in your future and that of your community by keeping the dollars within your local economy, all while enjoying the best food possible. Bringing food back home ensures that everyone has access to affordable, organic, sustainably raised, delicious food.This Indiegogo campaign is only intended to get the ball rolling.  Would you like to join our team? We welcome any and all levels of interest from Production Assistants to Executive Producers.  Every penny of this campaign will be spent on production costs regardless of whether or not we reach our fundraising goals here. THE CHALLENGEThis film is an immense project, with many moving parts. We are a two-person filmmaking team and we need your help!Our greatest asset in completing this film is our ability to tell an inspiring story that will empower other communities to follow suit.  Collectively, we have over 35 years experience in marketing and film advertising, but it is the young farmers who make this story compelling. The challenge will be taking this story to higher platforms, to share and learn and grow with other communities around the globe.JOIN THE FOOD REVOLUTIONPlease donate what you can to our campaign. With every dollar raised we are investing in the land and the farmers who are rebuilding our community by taking us back to our agricultural roots. Another way to help is to join the food revolution and spread the word!• Share this campaign on all your social media pages.

<p>The Background</p>
<p>We are parents to two young boys that are full of energy. Our older son is three and enjoys practicing yoga -- at daycare, at home, and at local studios with offerings for kids. We looked for a mat for him and were disappointed with the options on the market. Too small, too big, badly designed, overly designed, or made of cheap PVC. We thought we could offer something better, and SweetLime was born.</p>
<p>The Vision</p>
<p>Our vision for the design of the mats, shown in the renderings here, is based around yoga poses. We think these are relatable and fun for kids, and it reinforces learning the poses at the same time. We are starting with two designs for our initial run, and hope to add a third sometime in the next year.</p>
<p>The Details</p>
<p>The mats will be 59 inches x 24 inches x 0.12 inches, the perfect size for kids. (The average height of a 10 year old boy is 55"" per the CDC). They will be made of TPE, which is higher quality than PVC, more environmentally friendly than PVC, and has excellent stickiness that kids need for grip.</p>
<p>The Request</p>
<p>We are asking for funding to produce our initial run of mats to launch on Amazon in late 2016/ early 2017.</p>
<p>The Team</p>
<p>We are an entrepreneurial husband and wife team with the experience to bring this product to market. Erin is a digital marketer and project manager, contributing business savvy, organizational acumen, and branding expertise. Alex is a supply chain manager, contributing his knowledge of purchasing, sourcing, and logistics.</p>
<p>Erin is a digital marketer and project manager who specializes in getting things done. She is an entrepreneur, organizer-in-chief, brand steward, design lover, and social media maven.</p>

<h3>Contribution</h3>
<p>Contributors get to see Fourpenny House come to life in the quaint village of La Mesa, California.  With an existing space and design and construction beginning, every dollar contributed brings us closer to opening the doors to this unique concept.  Join Fourpenny's growing party of supporters and fans!</p>
<p>With our $75,000 raised we will be able to compliment investor funds for construction of the kitchen and front of house.  As our campaign is not fixed to the target amount, any amount raised will be of great benefit.  The building we occupy is currently an empty shell so we need to add in all our utilities and level the concrete floor in the kitchen, along with several partitions in the dining and bar area.  Our building dates to 1926 and we are excited to restore the building to its original beauty.</p>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Starting a restaurant is never easy, and there are many risks in this industry.  One way we are addressing the narrow profits in the restaurant industry is by focusing on beer and spirits, which provide high profits with low labor costs, and by brewing in-house we can lower of cost-of-goods and raise profits even higher.   </p>
<p>Owner Peter Soutowood has lived in La Mesa for over a dozen years and watched the demographic shift younger and more cosmopolitan.  The city is undergoing a renaissance and with a recently-completed street improvement the Village has never looked better.  With our location right in the heart of the Village and as one of the few craft restaurants to serve La Mesa, the growth potential is phenomenal, something the owners and investors are counting on for the success of Fourpenny House.</p>
<p>By keeping construction costs trimmed down and being creative with materials and design, we hope to minimize debt load and drive the restaurant to profitability as quickly as possible.  Utilizing seasonal and local foods means both higher quality and lower costs in both transportation and exclusivity.  </p>

</div></div>","Summary What happens when a community wants a place where handmade replaces mass-produced, where the seasons dictate the menu, where conversation flows as easy as the beer? Architect/baker/brewer Peter Soutowood has paired up with a world-class chef Joshua Soth to bring you Fourpenny House--just what La Mesa wants.


Staff


Owner Peter Soutowood has been baking and brewing his entire life, starting with chocolate eclairs in his grandmother's kitchen when he was barely tall enough to see to the counter.  As a licensed architect he brings a love for thoughtful design, comfort, and acoustic control so company can be enjoyed as much as the food and drink.  Overseeing the house brews and baking means his craftsmanship will show in the election and creation of curated experiences for every customer.

Chef Joshua Soth is an industry veteran known for his distinct ability to create innovative riffs on traditional dishes, who came to San Diego with more than two decades of restaurant experience.  His progressive approach in the kitchen has allowed Soth to garner numerous awards including a feature in Celebrated Chefs Chicago and multiple awards for his role at one of Chicago's Top New Restaurants in 2007.  After successfully heading two restaurants, Soth transitioned into catering as the executive chef/chef consultant at Catered By Design, an award-winning company voted Chicago's #1 Wedding Caterer by The Knot magazine and Chicago's Best Caterer by Wedding Wire.  He strives to introduce a local and seasonal cuisine while challenging the palates of guests.

Contribution
Contributors get to see Fourpenny House come to life in the quaint village of La Mesa, California.  With an existing space and design and construction beginning, every dollar contributed brings us closer to opening the doors to this unique concept.  Join Fourpenny's growing party of supporters and fans!
With our $75,000 raised we will be able to compliment investor funds for construction of the kitchen and front of house.  As our campaign is not fixed to the target amount, any amount raised will be of great benefit.  The building we occupy is currently an empty shell so we need to add in all our utilities and level the concrete floor in the kitchen, along with several partitions in the dining and bar area.  Our building dates to 1926 and we are excited to restore the building to its original beauty.



    Risks & Challenges Starting a restaurant is never easy, and there are many risks in this industry.  One way we are addressing the narrow profits in the restaurant industry is by focusing on beer and spirits, which provide high profits with low labor costs, and by brewing in-house we can lower of cost-of-goods and raise profits even higher.   
Owner Peter Soutowood has lived in La Mesa for over a dozen years and watched the demographic shift younger and more cosmopolitan.  The city is undergoing a renaissance and with a recently-completed street improvement the Village has never looked better.  With our location right in the heart of the Village and as one of the few craft restaurants to serve La Mesa, the growth potential is phenomenal, something the owners and investors are counting on for the success of Fourpenny House.
By keeping construction costs trimmed down and being creative with materials and design, we hope to minimize debt load and drive the restaurant to profitability as quickly as possible.  Utilizing seasonal and local foods means both higher quality and lower costs in both transportation and exclusivity.  

    Other Ways You Can Help Our success relies on the quality and consistency of our product and service, but it depends on our customers and fans.  By keeping a buzz around our forthcoming opening, sharing our pictures and posts, and telling friends and family about this exciting new gastropub means we will be busy from the first evening we open.  Spread the word, spread the love!",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479308061/gpxz95kw3e12bwm5mita.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Por que importar do Brasil?</p>
<p>O Brasil é um país produtor nato, tanto de produtos de primeira necessidade quanto de produtos acabados. O Brasileiro tem o empreendedorismo e a criatividade nas veias. Produtos brasileiros podem ser bons, bonitos e baratos. Podem realmente te surpreender.</p>
<p>O Pequeno/Medio produtor tem a capacidade de criação, produção em pequena escala, customização em casos específicos. É Versátil, é empreendedor, é criativo, é flexível.</p>
<p>E ainda temos a famosa e não menos importante receptividade do Brasileiro: somos o povo mais receptivo do mundo!</p>
<p>Porém, embora sejamos a maior economia da américa Latina e a segunda na América, estamos atrás de países como Chile e Colombia no quesito Exportação. Motivo: não sabemos como vender nossos produtos, nao temos apoio suficiente aos pequenos e médios produtores, não somos reconhecidos mundialmente, não somos vistos o bastante.</p>
<p>Por estes motivos, optamos por iniciar uma plataforma de exportação (NÃO É UM E-COMMERCE), uma vitrine de produtos brasileiros, caseiros ou industrializados, mas de excelente qualidade, voltados especificamente para a Exportação, para que o mundo possa  experimentar um pouco do que temos a oferecer.</p>
<p>Nesta plataforma vamos disponibilizar conteúdo para que consumidores e vendedores comuniquem-se através de catálogos, links, fotos, enfim, tudo o que possa facilitar a aproximação, a visibilidade, o contato e a venda.</p>
<p>Estamos em tempos difíceis. A Saída para as dificuldades é a união de forças por meio de grupos que, apoiando-se com um mesmo objetivo, tornam factíveis possibilidades até então jamais exploradas. É o caso da exportação em grupo, a consolidação de soluções financeiras, econômicas e logísticas para redução de custos, a famosa e atual rede do bem.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479308184/fdlc4huwky3rna3kvgm5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Escolhemos 30 empresas para iniciarmos o projeto: 30 empresas com as quais formamos um profile inicial, de profissionais liberais e empresas de pequeno porte (micro empresas). Delas faremos o primeiro lançamento do site, a primeira 'subida' de fotos e imagens, catálogos e documentos técnicos. Com estas 30 empresas formaremos nosso primeiro trabalho em conjunto, a primeira consolidação de mercadorias para exportação.</p>
<p>Me chamo Cintia, sou sócia e co-fundadora da Zeit Trading, uma comercial exportadora que tem como objetivo tornar possível projetos de crescimento dos pequenos e médios produtores brasileiros por meio da exportação, permitindo-lhes alcançar todos os cantos do mundo, seja qual for a distancia.</p>
<p>Entenda nossa causa:</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Qualquer ajuda é valida. Quanto mais contribuições conseguirmos, maior será o numero de produtores, artesãos, fabricantes e profissionais liberais envolvidos. Maior será também a variedade de produtos que podemos oferecer na plataforma, aumentando a visibilidade dos vendedores para todo o mundo. Pequenas lojas, pequenas redes... vamos integrar pessoas, integrar redes, produzir trabalho para todos.</p>
<p>Produtos como doces e alimentos típicos brasileiros, artesanato, cosméticos naturais e de qualidade feitos com essências brasileiras e plantas da nossa flora, além de produtos para decoração, utilidades domésticas, maquinários para pequenos e medios empreendedores em todo o mundo, vestuários, bijuterias  e sapatos feitos a mão ou em pequena escala (o que garante em alguns casos a exclusividade do produto), brinquedos educativos e móveis inteligentes infanto-juvenis (móveis com mais de uma utilidade, que nao se perdem com o crescimento da criança), Bebidas alcoólicas artesanais (a nossa verdadeira e brasileiríssima cachaça), produtos 100% naturais (inclusive alguns veganos)... são nossas opções iniciais.</p>
<p>Visite nosso site: <a href=""http://www.zeittrading.com.br"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.zeittrading.com.br</a> e <a href=""http://www.zeitrep.com.br"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.zeitrep.com.br</a> e saiba mais.</p>
<p>Todo o investimento recebido será aplicado na composição da plataforma online de consulta aos produtos e em sua promoção nas redes sociais. Se o valor superar nossas expectativas, partiremos então para a segunda parte do projeto: uma plataforma de EXPORTAÇÃO ONLINE, para que qualquer consumidor/comprador, em qualquer parte do mundo, possa comprar qualquer quantidade e receber o produto na porta de sua casa, com conforto, rapidez e segurança. Todo o processo de exportação será online, inclusive o rastreamento.</p>
</div><div>

</div></div>","Short Summary

Por que importar do Brasil?
O Brasil é um país produtor nato, tanto de produtos de primeira necessidade quanto de produtos acabados. O Brasileiro tem o empreendedorismo e a criatividade nas veias. Produtos brasileiros podem ser bons, bonitos e baratos. Podem realmente te surpreender.
O Pequeno/Medio produtor tem a capacidade de criação, produção em pequena escala, customização em casos específicos. É Versátil, é empreendedor, é criativo, é flexível.
E ainda temos a famosa e não menos importante receptividade do Brasileiro: somos o povo mais receptivo do mundo!
Porém, embora sejamos a maior economia da américa Latina e a segunda na América, estamos atrás de países como Chile e Colombia no quesito Exportação. Motivo: não sabemos como vender nossos produtos, nao temos apoio suficiente aos pequenos e médios produtores, não somos reconhecidos mundialmente, não somos vistos o bastante.
Por estes motivos, optamos por iniciar uma plataforma de exportação (NÃO É UM E-COMMERCE), uma vitrine de produtos brasileiros, caseiros ou industrializados, mas de excelente qualidade, voltados especificamente para a Exportação, para que o mundo possa  experimentar um pouco do que temos a oferecer.
Nesta plataforma vamos disponibilizar conteúdo para que consumidores e vendedores comuniquem-se através de catálogos, links, fotos, enfim, tudo o que possa facilitar a aproximação, a visibilidade, o contato e a venda.
Estamos em tempos difíceis. A Saída para as dificuldades é a união de forças por meio de grupos que, apoiando-se com um mesmo objetivo, tornam factíveis possibilidades até então jamais exploradas. É o caso da exportação em grupo, a consolidação de soluções financeiras, econômicas e logísticas para redução de custos, a famosa e atual rede do bem.

Escolhemos 30 empresas para iniciarmos o projeto: 30 empresas com as quais formamos um profile inicial, de profissionais liberais e empresas de pequeno porte (micro empresas). Delas faremos o primeiro lançamento do site, a primeira 'subida' de fotos e imagens, catálogos e documentos técnicos. Com estas 30 empresas formaremos nosso primeiro trabalho em conjunto, a primeira consolidação de mercadorias para exportação.
Me chamo Cintia, sou sócia e co-fundadora da Zeit Trading, uma comercial exportadora que tem como objetivo tornar possível projetos de crescimento dos pequenos e médios produtores brasileiros por meio da exportação, permitindo-lhes alcançar todos os cantos do mundo, seja qual for a distancia.

What We Need & What You Get
Qualquer ajuda é valida. Quanto mais contribuições conseguirmos, maior será o numero de produtores, artesãos, fabricantes e profissionais liberais envolvidos. Maior será também a variedade de produtos que podemos oferecer na plataforma, aumentando a visibilidade dos vendedores para todo o mundo. Pequenas lojas, pequenas redes... vamos integrar pessoas, integrar redes, produzir trabalho para todos.
Produtos como doces e alimentos típicos brasileiros, artesanato, cosméticos naturais e de qualidade feitos com essências brasileiras e plantas da nossa flora, além de produtos para decoração, utilidades domésticas, maquinários para pequenos e medios empreendedores em todo o mundo, vestuários, bijuterias  e sapatos feitos a mão ou em pequena escala (o que garante em alguns casos a exclusividade do produto), brinquedos educativos e móveis inteligentes infanto-juvenis (móveis com mais de uma utilidade, que nao se perdem com o crescimento da criança), Bebidas alcoólicas artesanais (a nossa verdadeira e brasileiríssima cachaça), produtos 100% naturais (inclusive alguns veganos)... são nossas opções iniciais.
Visite nosso site: www.zeittrading.com.br e www.zeitrep.com.br e saiba mais.
Todo o investimento recebido será aplicado na composição da plataforma online de consulta aos produtos e em sua promoção nas redes sociais. Se o valor superar nossas expectativas, partiremos então para a segunda parte do projeto: uma plataforma de EXPORTAÇÃO ONLINE, para que qualquer consumidor/comprador, em qualquer parte do mundo, possa comprar qualquer quantidade e receber o produto na porta de sua casa, com conforto, rapidez e segurança. Todo o processo de exportação será online, inclusive o rastreamento.

The Impact
Fomentando a exportação também dos pequenos e médios produtores criamos um círculo de consumo que deverá, em um periodo curto de tempo, proporcionar um movimento financeiro positivo entre fabricantes de materia prima, produtores, profissionais e mão de obra ocasional e prestadores de serviços.
Este movimento positivo conectará pessoas, promoverá novas oportunidades e perspectivas a quem embora não tenha uma estrutura física, tem boa vontade, criatividade e coragem de sobra para inovar, reinventar-se, seguir adiante.

Acreditamos que um pequeno movimento positivo se propaga como ondas, como quando lançamos uma pedrinha na água: podemos enxergar onde a pedra caiu, mas não podemos ver até onde a onda provocada pelo atrito da pedra com a água chegou. Este movimento pode estender-se a lugares que jamais pensamos alcançar, pode encontrar pelo caminho pessoas realmente determinadas a ajudar, cooperar, fazer parte. Pode criar novos movimentos ao redor do mundo, em favor dos que precisam, além do simples interesse financeiro da compra e da venda.
Se cada um de nós colocar um pouco de nosso know-how e fé neste projeto, nao só ajudaremos pessoas mas daremos a elas uma nova perspectiva para recomeçar.

<p>Most advanced airbags are designed to:</p>
<p align=""left"">A) Not deploy at all for low-speed impacts.</p>
<p align=""justify"">B) Deploy the airbag with a moderate force for most collisions, reserving the maximum deployment force for the severest of collisions only.<br/><br/>SAAS' airbag unit features a tailored deployment force to match the severity of any crash. A pyrotechnic inflator divided into 4 chambers, each connected to the airbag through a valve, combine to 15 unique deployment stages. This even allows for a safe airbag deployment at low-speed impacts where current airbags don't deploy at all.<br/><br/>SAAS is designed to be an integrated part of any car safety design. By using radar it predicts the expected g-force at impact and keeps the most appropriate stage ready for deployment.<br/><br/>SAAS can reduce airbag-attributed injuries and fatalities. <br/></p><p align=""justify""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459287275/hzrkk9j9hfpvcrpleyjy.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

Airbags protect car occupants from injuries and even death during a crash.</p><p align=""justify"">When it comes to life-saving technology, new airbags are continuously being designed, tested and studied.

They pointed out it was the force of the airbag that injured them and not the crash itself. More research on forums confirmed that many people are being injured by the airbag deployment force and not by the forces of the car crash itself.<br/><br/>

<p align=""Center"">SAAS is inspired by people who got seriously injured during a car crash.<br/>People who didn't get injured by the effects of the crash itself, but by the force of an inflating airbag. That could have happened to any one of us.<br/>
<br/>Is this risk really an acceptable reality?<br/>
<br/>Because we realize that people are being harmed by something that was designed to protect us, we know something has to change.<br/>This is why we invented a safer airbag system - SAAS.<br/>

A personal message from the inventors of SAAS:Hi!

We are extremely proud to present you something unique and exceptional.Something that the world hasn't seen yet.We have been working tirelessly to introduce you to the future of airbags - the revolutionary Speed Adjusted Airbag System (SAAS).And we need YOU to help make it happen!



| Introducing SAAS |

World’s Best AIRBAG SYSTEM with 15 Stages 
is a crowdfunding campaign that aims to improve airbag safety worldwide.

Our goal with this campaign is:
To raise awareness of the potential of SAAS and its possibilities.
To raise funds to create a 3D animation of SAAS and how it functions.To raise funds to attend automotive industry seminars and present SAAS with the 3D animation.To lay the foundation for implementing SAAS into future car safety designs.
Before you start scrolling down, here is our contact information.We'd love to hear from you! Follow us on Twitter and Facebook:



 

A quick overview of what we will present you on our campaign page:1. Let's talk about SAAS
2. How SAAS works3. Airbags today
4. SAAS' key features
5. Our inspiration
6. Our vision with SAAS7. Our goal with SAAS
8. Why we need you
9. How you can help (Perks!)


Most advanced airbags are designed to:
A) Not deploy at all for low-speed impacts.
B) Deploy the airbag with a moderate force for most collisions, reserving the maximum deployment force for the severest of collisions only.SAAS' airbag unit features a tailored deployment force to match the severity of any crash. A pyrotechnic inflator divided into 4 chambers, each connected to the airbag through a valve, combine to 15 unique deployment stages. This even allows for a safe airbag deployment at low-speed impacts where current airbags don't deploy at all.SAAS is designed to be an integrated part of any car safety design. By using radar it predicts the expected g-force at impact and keeps the most appropriate stage ready for deployment.SAAS can reduce airbag-attributed injuries and fatalities. 
 Safety Features: (1) Collision Detection. (2) Pre-Crash Measures.SAAS' PCS can detect an inevitable collision and prepare for it by adjusting the airbag deployment force to the predicted impact speed, by keeping 1 of 15 deployment stages ready to deploy at impact.The video below demonstrates how SAAS’ PCS operates before impact: Because every car crash is different, SAAS optimizes airbag protection for each crash by deploying the airbag with the force that best matches the detected g-force at impact. If necessary, the airbag control unit will correct the predicted deployment force. The heavier the measured g-force, the higher the cushion effect of the airbag.
The video below demonstrates how SAAS operates in the event of a collision:SAAS includes and combines the following components:
Doppler radar
Central Control Module (CCM)
Airbag Control Unit (ECU)
4 crash sensors
Customized pyrotechnical airbag inflator
Speedometer


The key component of SAAS is the airbag inflator, which is divided into 4 individual propellant chambers with a solid chemical propellant charge.Chambers 1 to 4 have relative output forces of respectively 1, 2, 4 and 8, which can combine into 15 different inflation forces, using the binary system.

Airbags are universally recognized as an indispensable part of car safety designs. Airbags protect car occupants from injuries and even death during a crash.When it comes to life-saving technology, new airbags are continuously being designed, tested and studied. Ever since the original airbag prototype in 1963, various types of airbags have been designed to specifically protect drivers and passengers from certain kinds of trauma.However, despite the obvious benefits of airbags, present-day airbags still have potentially dangerous characteristics during inflation.SRS airbags are designed to provide additional protection, but still pose a risk for serious or fatal injuries. The ones most at risk for airbag-attributed injuries are elderly, women and children.Ask yourself this: ""Doesn't it seem questionable that only 3 airbag deployment stages would fit the wide speed range of modern vehicles?""We are convinced 3 stages is not sufficient at all.We became aware of this when two people shared their personal experience. They pointed out it was the force of the airbag that injured them and not the crash itself. More research on forums confirmed that many people are being injured by the airbag deployment force and not by the forces of the car crash itself.





SAAS is inspired by people who got seriously injured during a car crash.People who didn't get injured by the effects of the crash itself, but by the force of an inflating airbag. That could have happened to any one of us.
Is this risk really an acceptable reality?
Because we realize that people are being harmed by something that was designed to protect us, we know something has to change.This is why we invented a safer airbag system - SAAS.



In an era of constantly evolving technology, should we really settle for mechanics which, even though designed to protect, also have the potential to kill?We designed SAAS to maximize airbag safety and reduce airbag attributed injuries. It should raise the bar for airbag safety worldwide.


 Our 3 big steps to realize SAAS:

We will... 1. Finalize our funding on IndieGoGo and send off the perks.
 2. Create a visually clear and effective 3D animation of SAAS.
 3. Attend seminars to present SAAS to the automotive industry.


 Our ultimate goal with SAAS:We want to make SAAS a standard part of future car safety designs and improve airbag safety on a worldwide scale, ultimately saving more lives.   How we, the inventors, are going to accomplish our goal:
 To accomplish our goal we will use the funds we receive through IndieGogo to pursue the following 2 milestones:

Milestone 1 | SAAS 3D Animation | (Image below)


Milestone 2 | Presenting SAAS on Automotive Seminars | (Image below)
 Why do these 2 milestones need funding on IndieGogo?

Milestone 1 | SAAS 3D Animation — needs funding to create a clear convincing presentation of what SAAS can do and what it can mean for car safety worldwide.


Milestone 2 | Presenting SAAS on Automotive Seminars — needs funding to make trips & visits to auto seminars possible by covering accommodation and travel expenses.  Milestone 1 | SAAS 3D Animation — Why do we need a 3D animation of SAAS?
 A professional 3D animation of SAAS is important because we will use it when presenting SAAS on automotive seminars. We need a powerful visual presentation to show the automotive industry how the airbag system operates in real-life situations, including the behavior of its components when detecting a possible collision and during an actual crash.
 Milestone 2 | Attending Automotive Seminars — Why do we need to attend to automotive seminars? 
 Attending automotive seminars is important because we need to present SAAS to the automotive industry to take it to the next level. Companies, engineers and legislators within the automotive industry need to be convinced of the necessity of our 15-stage airbag system and get it implemented in the safety design of next generation cars.

<p>What are these
“Slivers”? The Slivers are the brains of the computer system and
come in a variety of flavors. Each Sliver serves a different purpose
and can be combined in a PiNAPoL System in multiple different
configurations. Below is a brief description of the Slivers and what
they can offer you!</p>
<p>1. XPU Slivers –
Contain 1 CPU/1 GPU or 1 CPU/3GPU and can be setup in multiple
configurations based on if you need more processing power or more
graphics power. These will use the Intel Atom CPU and the nVidia Tegra
K1 GPU.</p>
<p>2. Storage Slivers –
Contain 2 slots for m.2 SATA Solid State Storage Modules. Coming
standard with 500 GB per Sliver, they are upgradable to 2 TB of
storage per module.</p>
<p>3. Home/Office
Automation Slivers – Used to connect to smart devices in the home
allowing you to fully automate the process of turning on/off lights,
enabling of disabling devices in the home, and also allows you to set
it for vacation mode, which will (for example) turn on/off lights,
TV, Radio, etc, to simulate activity in the home to deter intruders!</p>
<p>4. Home/Office
Security Slivers – Contains a specially designed microphone which
can detect the sounds of glass breaking, CO or Fire alarms going off,
can notify you as well as the local e911 services in the even of fire
or break-ins. These Slivers can talk to up to 16 wireless security
cameras PER Sliver, giving you a great view of your home or office.
If Paired with the home automation and GPS sliver, it can also notify
police/fire personnel to your home, and even unlock smart locks on
your doors in the event you are not home and a fire happens. This also
notifies you on your BLADE or cell phone in the event of an
emergency.</p>
<p>5. GPS Track &amp;
Trace Sliver -  Can be used in the home or office to track cell
phones, company vehicles, or notify e911 services (if paired with the
security module) to allow emergency personnel to locate your home.
This is great for keeping track of the kids, pets, vehicles, and also
helps if you system is ever stolen, you can track it!</p>
<p>6. Professional
Audio Sliver – Used specifically to allow users to plug-in
additional audio equipment such as mix boards, as well as assist with
rendering of audio tracks, creating songs, rendering CD-Audio, or
creating blockbuster movie soundtracks!</p>
<p>7. Professional
Video Sliver -  Used to assist with everything from CAD, Graphics,
and Video rendering allowing even the part time artist to begin
working on animations or feature length films. There are ports
available to plug in external equipment such as camcorders or other
video devices which you may want to re-master media from (VHS to DVD
for example).</p>

about the B.L.A.D.E. - Our handheld control center allowing you full
remote access to your PiNAPoL from anywhere in the world using 4G LTE
and XLTE technologies, as well as having a higher level of alerts for
security, system health, and allowing you to connect to your security
system from afar and check in on your home or office!<br/><br/><p>That's not all this
can do, it is also a cellular phone with some amazing features. For
example, this device comes with a 720p DLP projector on the top of
the phone as well as a stylus with a laser pointer, 18 MP camera, and
starts with 128 GB of solid state storage, upgradable to 1.2 TB!
Thats an amazing amount of storage and power right in the palm of
your hand. This device will run on either our own Linux based OS, or
Android and is powered by the nVidia Tegra K1 Processor!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>HOW IT ALL WORKS: The very simple explanation of that is ... You can 
either start with just the Slice and a XPU Sliver and replace your 
current computer with newer technology, or you can jump right in and 
immerse yourself in the future RIGHT NOW!</p>
<p>By jumping to a larger setup, let's say ""The Big Boy!"" for example. 
You will receive 2 Slices, with the proper Sliver modules to make them 
run. You will also receive the PiNAPoL system, which then becomes your 
whole home/office server system with quite a lot of power. The PiNAPoL 
will be able to handle all of the networking functions you need such as;
 
</p>
<p>Multiple Internet Connections, including the ability to bond them 
together for more speed OR offering more bandwidth for multiple users. 
This setup will also allow data to be sent from the Slices, to be 
processed much faster on the PiNAPoL and then sent back to the Slices as
 a finished product. These transactions take place in a fraction of the 
time compared to even top end gaming systems we have today!</p>

FULLY PATENTED & TRADEMARKED

that's a ™ and a ®
What is the PiNAPoL?
A Network Attached Processing System that will allow multiple
microcomputers to work in tandem to process data, graphics, audio and
video more quickly than todays hardware. Allowing for up to 12
Microcomputer modules (“Slivers”) to be inserted at the same
time (allowing you to completely customize your system), and the ability to daisy-chain multiple PiNAPoL systems
together, allows for Potentially Infinite upgrade possibilities. The main PiNAPoL System runs using Linux to provide all of the functionality, however the Slice can run on any mainstream operating system such as Windows, Mac or Linux!

What is the “Slice”?
A Mini-Computer that sits on your desk/workspace that can replace the
current computer with the ability to use your current
peripherals (Mice/Keyboards/Monitors/Etc.). The Slice contains 1 slot
for a Sliver to be inserted and can be tailored to your exact needs!
These Mini- Computers are able to run on our own Linux OS, or any
mainstream version of Linux, Windows, or Mac allowing you to get
started into the technology without the worries of too much change!
The Slice comes standard with 8 GB of RAM, expandable to 32 GB. Simply Add a xPU Sliver and you have a fully functional high performance computer!
*This is all you need to get started into the new technology. Just 1 Slice with 1 xPU Sliver and you are up and running! Grab the Starter Kit Perk and get started with the future of computing today!
(xPU = CPU or GPU)



What are these
“Slivers”? The Slivers are the brains of the computer system and
come in a variety of flavors. Each Sliver serves a different purpose
and can be combined in a PiNAPoL System in multiple different
configurations. Below is a brief description of the Slivers and what
they can offer you!
1. XPU Slivers –
Contain 1 CPU/1 GPU or 1 CPU/3GPU and can be setup in multiple
configurations based on if you need more processing power or more
graphics power. These will use the Intel Atom CPU and the nVidia Tegra
K1 GPU.
2. Storage Slivers –
Contain 2 slots for m.2 SATA Solid State Storage Modules. Coming
standard with 500 GB per Sliver, they are upgradable to 2 TB of
storage per module.
3. Home/Office
Automation Slivers – Used to connect to smart devices in the home
allowing you to fully automate the process of turning on/off lights,
enabling of disabling devices in the home, and also allows you to set
it for vacation mode, which will (for example) turn on/off lights,
TV, Radio, etc, to simulate activity in the home to deter intruders!
4. Home/Office
Security Slivers – Contains a specially designed microphone which
can detect the sounds of glass breaking, CO or Fire alarms going off,
can notify you as well as the local e911 services in the even of fire
or break-ins. These Slivers can talk to up to 16 wireless security
cameras PER Sliver, giving you a great view of your home or office.
If Paired with the home automation and GPS sliver, it can also notify
police/fire personnel to your home, and even unlock smart locks on
your doors in the event you are not home and a fire happens. This also
notifies you on your BLADE or cell phone in the event of an
emergency.
5. GPS Track &
Trace Sliver -  Can be used in the home or office to track cell
phones, company vehicles, or notify e911 services (if paired with the
security module) to allow emergency personnel to locate your home.
This is great for keeping track of the kids, pets, vehicles, and also
helps if you system is ever stolen, you can track it!
6. Professional
Audio Sliver – Used specifically to allow users to plug-in
additional audio equipment such as mix boards, as well as assist with
rendering of audio tracks, creating songs, rendering CD-Audio, or
creating blockbuster movie soundtracks!
7. Professional
Video Sliver -  Used to assist with everything from CAD, Graphics,
and Video rendering allowing even the part time artist to begin
working on animations or feature length films. There are ports
available to plug in external equipment such as camcorders or other
video devices which you may want to re-master media from (VHS to DVD
for example).

Let's never forget
about the B.L.A.D.E. - Our handheld control center allowing you full
remote access to your PiNAPoL from anywhere in the world using 4G LTE
and XLTE technologies, as well as having a higher level of alerts for
security, system health, and allowing you to connect to your security
system from afar and check in on your home or office!That's not all this
can do, it is also a cellular phone with some amazing features. For
example, this device comes with a 720p DLP projector on the top of
the phone as well as a stylus with a laser pointer, 18 MP camera, and
starts with 128 GB of solid state storage, upgradable to 1.2 TB!
Thats an amazing amount of storage and power right in the palm of
your hand. This device will run on either our own Linux based OS, or
Android and is powered by the nVidia Tegra K1 Processor!

HOW IT ALL WORKS: The very simple explanation of that is ... You can 
either start with just the Slice and a XPU Sliver and replace your 
current computer with newer technology, or you can jump right in and 
immerse yourself in the future RIGHT NOW!
By jumping to a larger setup, let's say ""The Big Boy!"" for example. 
You will receive 2 Slices, with the proper Sliver modules to make them 
run. You will also receive the PiNAPoL system, which then becomes your 
whole home/office server system with quite a lot of power. The PiNAPoL 
will be able to handle all of the networking functions you need such as;
 

Multiple Internet Connections, including the ability to bond them 
together for more speed OR offering more bandwidth for multiple users. 
This setup will also allow data to be sent from the Slices, to be 
processed much faster on the PiNAPoL and then sent back to the Slices as
 a finished product. These transactions take place in a fraction of the 
time compared to even top end gaming systems we have today!
As you can see, there are many different options available and 
should you require any assistance with customizing your system or you 
need a bit more information than what we have provided, please don't 
hesitate to contact us!Your PiNAPoL, Your Way! Scroll Down for more info!!!

<p><b>I kept moving my left arm from place to place</b> in an effort to find a comfortable, impact-free spot when driving. No Luck! You know that feeling, right?

I kept moving my left arm from place to place in an effort to find a comfortable, impact-free spot when driving. No Luck! You know that feeling, right? You park your elbow on the sill, then the armrest that is way too low and often too hard, then the steering wheel. And what about that dead space between the door and seat? 

I've been driving for many years, and simply tolerated the discomfort all this time. So, with the help of family, friends, and a fellow Marine I designed and we created a solution we've been using for years. Now, it's time to present it to the world.




      



                             There's Only One Place to Get Cruise Cushions.


                                                SEE PERKS BELOW


                                  

 From the
U.S. Government's National Institute of Health. Drivers’ Elbow: A Cause
of Ulnar Neuropathy (read). 



EASY TO CLEAN.
We Use Only The Highest
Quality Non-Stretch Cotton Velvet Fabric: 



Silky-smooth. elegant but
rugged, non-stretch cotton velvet with specially woven backing. Double-stitched, with sculpted, formed FLEX-FOAM Insert. 


 NO VELVETEEN, PATTERNED or
CRINKLY MATERIAL.

They are ergonomic—fit the
curve and shape of your body. 
They end elbow
pressure-point pain and arm fatigue.

 They cushion your
forearm—even upper arm.

Full Size:
     Exquisitely plush and Soft, 
Choose your colors during post-campaign survey

Logo-side: After the
campaign you choose which color upon which the CC-Logo is placed for the Custom Duo Color Option 'B'. 




HOW FLEXIBLE IS IT?
Fold it, Twist
it, Bend it, Bundle It, Crush it, Scrunch it, Squash
it, Squeeze it.
      


                Note: Dimensions may vary fractionally and almost immeasurably.

                                     





Reduces driver's elbow and left arm impact when driving.
Reduces stress.
Provides comfort while increasing comfort.
Greatly Increases the 'driving pleasure factor'.
Fills the dead space between door and seat.

A Few Placement Suggestions:

Window sill placement. 
Armrestand dead space between seat and door

Added Benefit: Filling The 'Console Gap.' When placed on left and/or driver or passenger side, little if anything can fall between the gap between the seats and console.



PROBLEMS CAN SERVE AS INSPIRATION.
Necessity is often the mother of invention. It's true! Being an engineer and a Marine helps inspire the belief there are always solutions. 
                                            
MORE USES
 
                                From idea, to design, to patent, to reality, to you.

CRUISE CUSHIONS™ make
driving less stressful for car and truck drivers and for other modes of travel.

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><br/><span style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px;""><p style=""font-weight: normal;"">...and I learned to season food at the young age of 10 in the kitchen, standing by and helping my Mom as she cooked everything from Fried Chicken to Pepper Steaks and plenty of home-baked goodies. <br/><br/>Later, I watched my father as he opened his first restaurant selling burgers, sandwiches, pizza and more in the little store he owned next to my high school; and that's where the dream of starting my own restaurant began! </p>
<p>My life has led me down various entrepreneurial paths, but I have never felt the timing was quite right to start a restaurant.  For the past 10 years, I have been blessed to build one of the most extensive networks of friends and associates throughout the city of Austin, and it was this same network that pushed me to take the leap of faith and start the very first <b>ROLLING ROOSTER</b> Food Truck. </p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""><b>How It All Began</b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">The journey began originally after I purchased a $30 fryer from Walmart and I would go out on my patio regularly and fry chicken wings; experimenting  with many different variables such as the types of oils, brands of chicken, cooking temperatures and a whole host of seasonings and spices. I spent  many evenings on my patio taste testing fried chicken wings and perfecting my craft . At one point, I began inviting friends and family over to rest my palate and be my taste testers! I would  go on to get the thumbs of from many of most critical friends.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Thanks to my mother, who is also my biggest supporter, </span>I felt like we had finally concocted a wing recipe good enough to please the masses - and so began our official journey!</p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""><b>Unique. Authentic. Ethnic</b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">I have created a simple yet effective menu that specializes in 3 proteins: chicken, fish and shrimp, all served with a rich buttermilk waffle. The Rolling Rooster food truck was the first of its kind in the Austin/Pflugerville area. Our food, shaped by decades of passion and soul, was well received by those looking for fresh food that wasn't frozen, well-seasoned and full of flavor in every bite!  As a result, we have been extremely blessed with huge growth and we are now ready to expand and build a brick-and-mortar restaurant to serve our growing fan base.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""><b> The Need, <b>The Niche</b></b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">Our market research among our current customers revealed a diverse population in the Pflugerville area that craved a place to dine on a great tasting southern-infused menu that was cooked to perfection and made fresh upon ordering. At the restaurant, we will also serve breakfast for the early risers who can get their morning cup of coffee, in addition to eggs, bacon, grits and other savory dishes. </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Saturdays and Sundays will also feature our </span><b>ALL YOU CARE TO EAT WING-INFUSED BRUNCH</b>, a first-of-it's-kind offering in this marketplace. The <b>NEW ROLLING ROOSTER</b> facility is in Pflugerville, in the same shopping center as Pizza Hut, located right next door to Pflugerville High School. The lease is signed and renovations are almost complete. </p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""><b>Exceptional Quality, Cost Efficient</b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">We have boot-strapped the start-up funding of the restaurant  through today. Our team has worked extremely hard to design a restaurant that provides exceptional quality, and yet remains cost efficient. My mother taught me how to be a continuous shopper, and  although she is 1,100 miles away, her lessons remain as fresh as to me as when she originally passed them down. </p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">We are now in the final stages of outfitting the space with the proper kitchen equipment including a vent-hood with fire suppression system, refrigeration, stove, ovens, fryers, grills, signage and more. Additional future expenses include the build out of a patio deck, as well as purchasing supplies, chairs, tables and a robust point-of-sale system.</p></span></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><span style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px;""><p style=""font-weight: normal;""><b>Casual, Comforting, Quick</b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">Our concept for the Rolling Rooster in Pflugerville is a casual restaurant that offers counter-service with plenty of comfortable seating. The food can be enjoyed on premise or picked up to-go to be savored at home or work.

</h3></div>","I'm a mama's boy...
...and I learned to season food at the young age of 10 in the kitchen, standing by and helping my Mom as she cooked everything from Fried Chicken to Pepper Steaks and plenty of home-baked goodies. Later, I watched my father as he opened his first restaurant selling burgers, sandwiches, pizza and more in the little store he owned next to my high school; and that's where the dream of starting my own restaurant began! 
My life has led me down various entrepreneurial paths, but I have never felt the timing was quite right to start a restaurant.  For the past 10 years, I have been blessed to build one of the most extensive networks of friends and associates throughout the city of Austin, and it was this same network that pushed me to take the leap of faith and start the very first ROLLING ROOSTER Food Truck. 
How It All Began
The journey began originally after I purchased a $30 fryer from Walmart and I would go out on my patio regularly and fry chicken wings; experimenting  with many different variables such as the types of oils, brands of chicken, cooking temperatures and a whole host of seasonings and spices. I spent  many evenings on my patio taste testing fried chicken wings and perfecting my craft . At one point, I began inviting friends and family over to rest my palate and be my taste testers! I would  go on to get the thumbs of from many of most critical friends.
Thanks to my mother, who is also my biggest supporter, I felt like we had finally concocted a wing recipe good enough to please the masses - and so began our official journey!
Unique. Authentic. Ethnic
I have created a simple yet effective menu that specializes in 3 proteins: chicken, fish and shrimp, all served with a rich buttermilk waffle. The Rolling Rooster food truck was the first of its kind in the Austin/Pflugerville area. Our food, shaped by decades of passion and soul, was well received by those looking for fresh food that wasn't frozen, well-seasoned and full of flavor in every bite!  As a result, we have been extremely blessed with huge growth and we are now ready to expand and build a brick-and-mortar restaurant to serve our growing fan base.
 The Need, The Niche
Our market research among our current customers revealed a diverse population in the Pflugerville area that craved a place to dine on a great tasting southern-infused menu that was cooked to perfection and made fresh upon ordering. At the restaurant, we will also serve breakfast for the early risers who can get their morning cup of coffee, in addition to eggs, bacon, grits and other savory dishes. 
Saturdays and Sundays will also feature our ALL YOU CARE TO EAT WING-INFUSED BRUNCH, a first-of-it's-kind offering in this marketplace. The NEW ROLLING ROOSTER facility is in Pflugerville, in the same shopping center as Pizza Hut, located right next door to Pflugerville High School. The lease is signed and renovations are almost complete. 
Exceptional Quality, Cost Efficient
We have boot-strapped the start-up funding of the restaurant  through today. Our team has worked extremely hard to design a restaurant that provides exceptional quality, and yet remains cost efficient. My mother taught me how to be a continuous shopper, and  although she is 1,100 miles away, her lessons remain as fresh as to me as when she originally passed them down. 
We are now in the final stages of outfitting the space with the proper kitchen equipment including a vent-hood with fire suppression system, refrigeration, stove, ovens, fryers, grills, signage and more. Additional future expenses include the build out of a patio deck, as well as purchasing supplies, chairs, tables and a robust point-of-sale system.Casual, Comforting, Quick
Our concept for the Rolling Rooster in Pflugerville is a casual restaurant that offers counter-service with plenty of comfortable seating. The food can be enjoyed on premise or picked up to-go to be savored at home or work. Everything we serve will be freshly prepared, so it will not be fast food; but it will be great food prepared efficiently to accommodate you and your busy schedule. We will be open Mon - Fri from 8am - 7pm for breakfast, lunch and dinner and we will start out with 8am - 9pm hours on Saturday and Sunday. 
I am currently serving in the role as Head Chef and I am in the process of hiring passionate people to help me deliver my kaleidoscope of aromas, spices and tastes to all of you in the Pflugerville area - the  same way as we have done in our food truck on Howard Lane.  We anticipate that the renovation being completed in mid to late December, and plan to open the doors to lots grumbling greedy bellies shortly after - just in time to cater your personal or office party this holiday season!

<p>Now, he is running a renovated building called the Temple, equipped with art-making spaces and a home for several small businesses that promote either artists or creative fields.

<p>Lewis Neeff watches a dollar bill in a fish tank as he works on crystalizing the appearance of the bill in his studio at the Temple art space. (<i>Seth McConnell, YourHub</i>)</p>
<p>The Temple, 2400 Curtis St., lies on the outskirts of both the Curtis Park Historic District and the River North Art District. Gordon was determined to make it into a place that was affordable for small businesses, nonprofits and artists who have found themselves <a href=""http://www.denverpost.com/denver/ci_27311072/artists-facing-higher-rents-looming-redevelopment-rino-denver"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">priced out of the surrounding area and other parts of downtown</a>. He bought the property with a partner he has since bought out. </p>
<p>""Everyone in this entire process has understood that this building is important to the community and the social mission would be the primary focus,"" Gordon said. </p>
<div>The Temple is home to places like PlatteForum, Processus, URBN Media, the Denver Zine Library and Sent(a)Mental Studios. It will add the Temple Bakery in December, which will be a joint venture between two bakers that will sell an assortment of baked goods during the day and pizza at night. It will also be a business incubator for two other bakers who can move on to start their own business after six months, with new proteges coming in at that time.<p></p>
<p>Gordon gave the bakery eight months of free rent and is running a <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/temple-bakery-living-wall-and-landscaping#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">crowdfunding campaign</a> to raise money for the bakery, the zine library and an art project to adorn the south-facing wall at the Temple. </p>
<p>""It's the perfect place for us,"" said Eden Myles, co-owner of the Temple Bakery. </p>

<p>The zine library is home to more than 15,000 ""zines"" — self-published magazines — and runs workshops for those who make them. Their portion of the fundraising will go toward providing a permanent display area for the library. </p>
<p>The library shares space with Sent(a)Mental Studios, an organization that works closely with the GLBT community and provides creative alternatives to suicide. </p>
<p>The library's co-founder, Kelly ""Shortandqueer"" Costello, said the Temple was the ideal place to move after the library's previous location was sold in west Denver. It also provided a means to connect with like-minded folks. </p>
<p>""The Temple became an opportunity to connect with those in that world,"" Costello said. </p>
<p>The 20-plus artists who rent space pay about $1.25 per square foot monthly, averaging about $350 per month, making it an affordable place in an area where many artists have already left for cheaper places. Many of the studios are also of a size where the occupant can sublet some of his or her space.</p>
<p>Mario Zoots was the first artist to move in when the building was still being renovated. He said the building has a weird energy and jokingly said it might be haunted, but he plans to be there for years to come. </p>
<p>""It's like a home away from home,"" Zoots said. ""It's a community, and there's great and talented artists there.""</p>
<p>Built in the late 1880s, the Temple has been home to three synagogues during its history, but was later home to a music venue that saw the likes of punk band Black Flag play there. More recently it has boarded-up windows and a hole in the roof. </p>
<p>The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and could become part of the Curtis Park Historic District, something Curtis Park Neighbors president Joel Noble said has been a long-time goal. Noble said he was worried the building would be torn down before Gordon and his partner acquired it. </p>
<p>""Now there's no sense of threat. While we do want it landmarked, there's not the pressure to get it done next week,"" Noble said </p>
<p>Gordon, an artist, musician and social entrepreneur, bought the building cheap with the intent of keeping it cheap for the community. </p>
<p>""It's just a model where the numbers can work,"" Gordon said. ""I know developers would say you can't do it. This was just a social thing and we did it and it's cool.""</p>

<p><b>Our Project</b></p>
<p>Your donation will fund the completion of three main
projects inside the Temple, each directly benefiting the neighborhood and the
community at large: </p>
<p>1. 
Launching the Temple Bakery.</p>
<p>2. 
Adding a permanent display area for the Denver
Zine Library.</p>
<p>3. 
Constructing a living wall and edible
landscaping to beautify the building's facade and provide food for the bakery.</p>
<p>This project will connect the Denver community with all
that’s created within the Temple’s walls while keeping local residents’ wallets
and stomachs from being empty.</p>
<p>The Temple Bakery will also serve as a creative incubator
for other food service entrepreneurs, offering culinary residencies and kitchen
rental opportunities for local producers to safely create value added products.</p>
<p><b>Who We Are</b></p>
<p>The Temple at 2400 Curtis has a century of colorful
religious, proprietary, and creative history behind it. The Temple exists today
as a social venture established to preserve and revive an important landmark in
the Five Points district while providing affordable studios to over twenty
professional artists, local non-profits and small businesses. This includes the
Processus creative workshop facility, community non-profit space for
PlatteForum and the Denver Zine Library/Sent(a)Mental Studios, and creative
business suites for URBN Media and Narro Design Firm.</p>
<p><b>Our Mission</b></p>
<p>Five Points, which holds the River North, or RiNo, and
Curtis Park neighborhoods, is facing cultural dilution due to rapid
gentrification. Homes are being bought and torn down to build modern
condominiums alongside the future sites of businesses like Starbucks and Whole
Foods.  Our mission is ultimately to
maintain and productively develop Five Points’ status as a hub for creative
culture by preserving the district’s original, artistic spirit alongside this
growth.</p>

Our Project
Your donation will fund the completion of three main
projects inside the Temple, each directly benefiting the neighborhood and the
community at large: 
1. 
Launching the Temple Bakery.
2. 
Adding a permanent display area for the Denver
Zine Library.
3. 
Constructing a living wall and edible
landscaping to beautify the building's facade and provide food for the bakery.
This project will connect the Denver community with all
that’s created within the Temple’s walls while keeping local residents’ wallets
and stomachs from being empty.
The Temple Bakery will also serve as a creative incubator
for other food service entrepreneurs, offering culinary residencies and kitchen
rental opportunities for local producers to safely create value added products.
Who We Are
The Temple at 2400 Curtis has a century of colorful
religious, proprietary, and creative history behind it. The Temple exists today
as a social venture established to preserve and revive an important landmark in
the Five Points district while providing affordable studios to over twenty
professional artists, local non-profits and small businesses. This includes the
Processus creative workshop facility, community non-profit space for
PlatteForum and the Denver Zine Library/Sent(a)Mental Studios, and creative
business suites for URBN Media and Narro Design Firm.
Our Mission
Five Points, which holds the River North, or RiNo, and
Curtis Park neighborhoods, is facing cultural dilution due to rapid
gentrification. Homes are being bought and torn down to build modern
condominiums alongside the future sites of businesses like Starbucks and Whole
Foods.  Our mission is ultimately to
maintain and productively develop Five Points’ status as a hub for creative
culture by preserving the district’s original, artistic spirit alongside this
growth.


The Temple BakeryThe Bakery and its nightly pizza shop would ideally be a gathering place for Five Points, bringing people together in the classic way that only food can. This project is an experimental collaboration between culinary visionaries Eden Myles (Five Points Pizza/Black Sheep Bakers) and Shauna Lott (The Long I Pie). They are currently working to develop this initiative with the RMMFI - Rocky Mountain Micro Finance Institute and DRI Goods Inc. - Denver Retail Incubator. The Denver Zine LibraryThe Denver Zine Library houses over 10,000 different zines, providing resources for entertainment and education. The Library’s location, immediately adjacent to the restaurant, will serve as a middle ground between the culinary and visual creative activities in the building. In order to respect the work on view, we need to build a more official display.The Living Wall - Growing Local Food & Empowering Local ArtistsThe remainder of the money earned through this project will be set aside to further The Temple’s sense of individual identity by creating a ‘living wall’ and several mural projects. The living wall will be a two-story trellis where micro-greens and other edibles can be grown. Other open-source agricultural designs will be installed by the Denver Permaculture Guild. The food grown here will be used in the Temple Bakery’s kitchen. The mural initiative will fund around five current Temple artists to impart their own unique vision onto the building via paint and light sculpture, further connecting the creative activity inside with the world at large.

Other Initiatives
There are many other Temple projects underway that are not a part of this crowdfunding campaign. A gallery is being developed to feature rotating exhibitions curated by resident artists in addition to a permanent installation of an exhibition of photographs and memorabilia detailing the site’s illustrious past. 
There are long-term plans to turn the roof level into a space for more agricultural development and/or social activity, and there is another partial story of the building currently being developed for more creative space. There has even been discussion about programming for the consistent production of original creative written content. 
Thanks For Your Support!
With your generous help, we can close the loop on a small series of projects that will help hoist The Temple to a plateau of operation upon which it can sustain meaningful public engagement, embracing the creative spirit of local people who care about bettering their environment through their practice.

<h1>Short Summary </h1>
<p></p>
<p>I plan to start raising Eurasian emerald darkhorns. This species
is known for its mild temperament, relatively fast maturity, disease
resistance, and prolific breeding habits. This means I'll be able to get a
better yield.</p>
<p>I’ll purchase a buck dragon to start my venture. I’ll put him out
to stud and charge fees for the service. Using the income from these stud fees
I hope to purchase a doe dragon and use these as a breeding pair to begin
raising my clan.</p>
<p>Through contacts at the local pub, I have located a reputable dragon dealer. He has found a dragon that will suit my needs. I have started corresponding with said dragon to explain my plan. At first he was
a little indignant about the whole stud services business, but once he
understood his role, he has become positively enthusiastic about the idea.</p>
<p>Based on the price quoted by the dealer, and the dragon
importation fees and licensing, I'm hoping to raise $750 to purchase the
darkhorn to begin my stud program. </p>
<p>Alternatively, I have found an Appalachian black in the
possession of a California celebrity. He’s bad tempered, in frail health,
missing teeth from years of soda drinking, and likes to mimic anyone he’s
speaking with. This is an obnoxious beast, whose favorite game is to wave his
claw around your body while yelling, “I’m not touching you.” The cost to buy
and license this dragon is $150. I’d prefer to start with higher quality stock,
but I’ll do what I must to achieve my dreams.</p>
<p>I took this business plan to bankers, but they were skeptical of
my ability to turn a profit in this industry. They also closed my personal
accounts. That’s why I’m posting it here in hopes of reaching out to dragon
enthusiasts around the world.</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3></h3>
<h1>Business Plan</h1>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>I will sell the dragons as security guardians. Given their
legendary propensity for hoarding and protecting treasure, this seems like a
gimme, but amazingly very few institutions use this age-old, hacker-proof
security system. Gringotts uses them, but we disagree with their training
methods and refuse to sell to them. Very few people are willing to burgle a
place guarded by dragons—hobbits wearing magic rings being the exception. Banks
and the Federal Reserve could profit by using more dragons.</p>
<h2>Aviation</h2>
<p>Another profitable use for these creatures is as novelty
transportation. I plan to work with some saddle makers and the FAA to offer
some short flight routes and in-city transportation.</p>
<p>Imagine arriving at your wedding or prom on dragonback! Each ride
will include, of course, a photo with the mount, and a serving of roasted fowl,
caught and served midflight.</p>
<h2>Sustainable meat source and craft source</h2>
<p>Dragon breeds differ, and raising wyverns (which breed like
rabbits and lack the power of speech, in fact they’re not true dragons) for
dragon steaks is another viable option. The meat is quite tender, with a naturally
spicy flavor, similar to steak that has been marinated in hot sauce—a zippy
alternative to standard fare</p>
<p>If you are offered dragon meat, it’s usually wyvern meat from a factory
farm. These animals have limited abilities to move, being housed in small
stalls. Often sedated and mutilated, corporations remove fangs and claws and
clip wings to keep them manageable. They are heavily dosed with hormones and
antibiotics to increase meat yield and to fight scale rot and eye infections. Our
wyverns will be free range, and kept calm by letting them breathe a little fire
now and then. We let them fly, knowing they’ll return to a home they love. This
will provide a superior cut of meat from a happier beast.</p>
<p>I hate waste, so the bones, teeth, claws and hide of any animals
harvested will be sold for various crafts, clothing, and magical ingredients.</p>
<h2>Culling less desirable humans</h2>
<p>The darkhorn I intend to purchase came up with this service:
reducing an overabundance of humans by eating less desirable elements of society.
His target prey would be Congress, anyone running for president (he proposes to
allow the country to vote on who he eats by paying a small fee), and anyone who
proves to be so hopelessly inept as to be polluting the gene pool (again,
nominations would include a small fee). To be quite honest, he said he doesn't
particularly like eating humans. High levels of sugar consumption have made
people cloyingly sweet and cause him severe indigestion, but he’s willing to do
this to improve society. </p>
<h2>Alternative fuel source</h2>
<p>Dragons make fire. Preliminary tests show that running
geothermic-style pipes through your dragon’s den produces abundant heat. Dragon
fire also burns hotter, even in your wood stove. That means you can run the
stove at a lower level and use less wood in the winter. Because of the higher
heat, there is less smoke and air pollution from dragon fires. A win for you,
the dragon, and the environment.</p>
<h2>Dragon conservation and repopulation</h2>
<p>As many know, dragons have experienced significant population
declines in the past century due to urban encroachment on their lands, loss of
prey, and through the scourge of dragon slayers. </p>
<p>Dragons were once found throughout the U.S. Now their range and
varieties are limited. You can still find the Great Basin sandwyrm and the
Sonoran blue in less populated portions of western Utah, eastern Nevada, and
Arizona. The only great wyrm still found in the east is the Great Lake
yellowbeard, and that variety is really more of a sea serpent. Dragons play a
vital role in the ecosystem. A healthy population of the Northwestern green
keeps the Sasquatch population in Oregon, Washington, and Idaho at sustainable
levels.  </p>
<p>We have successfully reintroduced grizzly bears and wolves into
ecosystems and seen how they have proven to be an asset: wolves have brought
balance to Yellowstone’s elk population. Reintroducing this megafauna to the
Americas can have widespread benefits. As an example, the recent griffin
attacks in northwestern Pennsylvania could have been averted by the presence of
the dragons that once populated that area.</p>
<p>I’ll work with the Forest Service and states throughout the union
to reintroduce these natural creatures in their historic ranges.</p>
<p>The dragon I have been corresponding with says these attitudes
and practices are the result of an anti-dragon media that seeks every
opportunity to play up supposed dragon offenses against people. With education
we can do this.</p>
<h2>Costs</h2>
<p>Any additional funds raised will be used to expand my dragon clan
and for related supplies and expenses. Examples are below:</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Land. As you probably know, dragons are not herd
animals, so raising a good population requires significant acreage. </p>

</div></div>","The Concept We are a group of veterans who all ended up at the same duty assignment after knowing each other for years. Unfortunately, El Paso Texas, which has one of the largest concentrations of military members, has the worst night life we have all seen. Between the 4 of us, we have been to and partied in over 30 countries. Our concept is to bring all of our experiences together and build the most badass club in  the south west.





What We Need 
We are seeking help to raise $200,000 to help us jump start our project. What the money will be used for:
1) Buy a bigger and better audio system
2) Get a larger location that will allow us to feature premier DJ's, host large functions like Beer Pong Championships, and have live performers.
3) Introduce tables with automated beer tap systems
4) Build a badass VIP section
If we raise more than $200,000
If we destroy this goal, we will of course add more Perks.  We would ultimately like to raise enough to have the club ready for new years and be able to throw a huge party with a premier hiphop artist and EDM/Hiphop DJ.  Our concept does allow us for any genre of music, which is awesome..but lets party for the new years!!!




The Impact
Basically, we want to build the best nightclub around! The nightlife in El Paso Texas sucks, and all the bars and nightclubs around here are just thrown together. We want to build a place that is better and badder than the rest.
Risks & Challenges
We are already teamed up with the best Pizzeria in town and have the connections with all of the major distributors for crafts beers, liquor and equipment. With the being said, the challenge is starting this new venture. In order to start this concept, we have all put our cash together but realized after talking to our people that we were shy by a few bucks to complete our entire concept. Before jumping into this, we would like your help to raise the funds to give us a running start!!!


Here are a few concept ideas we have seen around the world that we would like to incorporate into the club.
1) A Full Size Stage and Dance Floor that also incorporates 6 full service bars for our patrons.
 2) A Craft Beer/ Whiskey lounge that sits back away from the big party but not to far to miss the fun!!!



 3) A full Pool Room loaded with Pool Tables, TV's and a full service bar for those who aren't all about that dancing life.


 4) A badass VIP section with bottle service and dedicated personal servers. The VIP section will be modeled from some of the best VIP's in London.



5. Tables with automated taps, one of the popular trends in Europe




6) Projectors for all of the Fights, Sporting Events and Beer Challenge night! Regional Beer Pong tournaments

7) We will also be adding a Chicago Style Pizza Kitchen inside of it.

<div><br/></div> <p>Initial reaction to ""Fabrika"" has been awesome. There are already teams interested in participating. We have recieved a lot of praise and support for our effort, with many prominent Serbian activists offering pro-bono assistance. However, albeit welcome, we know that praise alone is not enough to make things happen. </p>
<p>The main challenge we face is raising enough funds to accelerate the chosen teams in our first year of operations. There is a risk that by October, when our programme is due to start, we will not have secured a grant that would finance it.  </p>
<p>But even in that scenario, we will not lay down our arms. We will continue to push towards securing an investment, with our director, Tanja, tirelessly knocking on every door, and our chairman, Serge, covering monthly expenses from his own personal savings. We will fully utilize our network of advisors towards that one goal, until the money is in and we are ready to revive our city. We will never, ever give up on Sombor and its people.</p>

The city of Sombor, Serbia is dying out. Once wide-known for its artistic and inclusive culture, recent wars and political turmoil have left it impoverished, eventless and unattractive. Its youth finds no moral nor financial support to explore its talents and express its abundant ideas, creativity and ethusiasm. With no-one to lead, or show the way, the young don't even know where to start. The prevailing culture has become that of pessimism and discouragement.

Determined to shake things up, Tanja Adzic (LinkedIn), and Serge Bajic (LinkedIn), a linguist and an MBA graduate, have took it upon themselves to make Sombor worth living in. They started ""Fabrika"" (Factory),  a social non profit accelerator that will provide working space, mentorship, financial support and easier access to funds to young teams with great ideas. Their vision is to change the town's culture to that of activism, creativity and innovation.



Fabrika will provide office space, mentorship, and assistance in obtaining financial grants to local teams with ideas of potentially great social value.


They need supporters who will help start ""Fabrika""-s manufacturing process, and save this gorgeous town and its youth from being left behind and forgotten.

discussion can thrive without discouragement and pessimism.When we asked our research respondents if they would execute an idea from the field of their interest if  they had “Fabrika”-s support, all of them (36 total) said “yes”.




What We Need & What You Get
Our immediate need is refurbishment and equipment of the working space for local teams - a place where ideas will thrive without discouragement. We will invest in promotional activities, in order to encourage teams with awesome ideas to apply. We will also need to pay for fixed costs such as rent and utilities. Once we have traction and something to show, we will be able to fundraise from established funds and institutions. 
Your donation will help us stand on our feet, and get us far enough to pursue more sustainable means of funding. You can find our entire budget on this link. 
Our supporters will be rewarded with a wide range of perks, from public introduction during openning event, through local handcrafts, down to the prized local fish stew recipe. 





  Risks & Challenges
 Initial reaction to ""Fabrika"" has been awesome. There are already teams interested in participating. We have recieved a lot of praise and support for our effort, with many prominent Serbian activists offering pro-bono assistance. However, albeit welcome, we know that praise alone is not enough to make things happen. 
The main challenge we face is raising enough funds to accelerate the chosen teams in our first year of operations. There is a risk that by October, when our programme is due to start, we will not have secured a grant that would finance it.  
But even in that scenario, we will not lay down our arms. We will continue to push towards securing an investment, with our director, Tanja, tirelessly knocking on every door, and our chairman, Serge, covering monthly expenses from his own personal savings. We will fully utilize our network of advisors towards that one goal, until the money is in and we are ready to revive our city. We will never, ever give up on Sombor and its people.

Other Ways You Can Help

 If you are not able to help financially, don't worry - there are other ways you can contribute. Share our campaign on your Facebook walls, and IM the persons in your network who are likely to be interested in our cause, and familiar with institutions providing grants to organizations such as ours.

Athens killer bar scene allows all of its citizens to go out, have a few drinks, and spend some quality time with some quality friends. But Athens doesn't just party at the clubs on Saturday night. Athens knows how to have a good time staying in as well. Whether it be a backyard barbecue, a pregame get-together, or a rocking house party, Athenians know how to have a good time at home. But with the party comes the chore of going out to the liquor store or super market and shopping for your beer, wine, liquor, and other beverage supplies. But with our service, the first of its kind in Athens, we will combine the price savings and comfort of a stay-at-home experience with the convenience of downtown bars. </p><p>Beer Run is an Athens-based business dedicated to quick and convenient beverage delivery to the citizens of Athens. With Beer Run's website, you will be able to order from a comprehensive list of your favorite beers, wines, and spirits and have them delivered directly to your door. And the best part, the prices you pay through Beer Run will be exactly the same as if you went to the store and bought them yourself! </p><p>There are many common situations that could be solved by the use of our service. Say you are hanging out with some friends, you've all had a couple of drinks, and you realize you are almost out of beer. Don't risk driving to the store, just have our drivers bring it to you! Its much more convenient and much safer. Maybe you started cooking for a dinner date and realized that you forgot to pick up that special bottle of wine on the way home from work. No worries, just order one of our wide varieties of wine and have it at your door in minutes. Are you busy planning a big birthday, anniversary, graduation or game-day party? Leave the liquor run to us and focus on having a great time. There is no end to the uses for our convenient and price-efficient service. </p><p>The pricing system for the use of our service will be very simple. The price of each item you order will be the exact same price that you would pay if you went to the store yourself. If you check out as a guest, on top of your order total, you will pay a small, flat delivery fee, in addition to an even smaller mileage fee, and have it delivered directly to your door. No matter the order size, you will pay the same small fee. Whether you get a single bottle of wine, or several cases of beer, the fee is always the same. All you need to have is your ID on hand and ready to be presented to your delivery driver, and its as easy as that. If you chose to be a part of one of our Membership Plans, its even easier than that! We will keep your information on file, and in addition to an even quicker checkout process, you will receive your delivery free of the delivery fee and the mileage fee! You won't pay a single cent more than if you had driven to the store yourself and checked out with the cashier in person. For the exact same price, you can get your order delivered directly to your house or place of business. </p><p>So if you are interested in becoming a member of this service, we are sure you are asking where your initial investment is going. The initial IndieGoGo investment will go towards the development of our website.

So in order to meet these goals, we are hiring an experienced professional to build our website. </p><p>Once the IndieGoGo campaign is completed (assuming it is successful), we believe we will be ready to begin operations in roughly 6 weeks. Our goal is to kick off our service on New Years Eve and to make 2016 our launch year.

The Personal membership, as you would guess, is a membership for one individual. This membership allows one person to order and that person has to accept the delivery with identification ready. The Household membership allows up to 4 people to share a membership. These 4 people could all upload their information to the one account, and any of those 4 people can order and accept deliveries made with this account. The benefits of this account is a per-person discount: starting at $7.50 per-person as opposed to $10. Finally, there is an Organizational Membership that is very similar to the Household Membership, but can have up to 16 people on the account. This is perfect for a business, social club, fraternity, etc. The savings for this membership are huge with per-person prices as low as $3.75 for a one month membership. </p><p>This service is in its infancy around the nation and we believe that it will be very applicable to the Athens market.

Growing up ""hood"" in the Analog to Digital Era
Our Theory of Change
As social justice organizers and technologists that grew up and live in Washington Heights, we want to bring NYC's Silicon Alley to ""da' hood"".  
The established link between education and health outcomes is the motivating force behind opening a tech center and natural/organic food cafe.  Washington Heights in the 1980's and 1990's was the crime capital of New York City.  Now, our neighborhood is experiencing a cultural and economic rebirth attracting all types of people and businesses wanting to call Washington Heights home.
Despite the technological revolution of the past fifteen years, and all the recent economic growth not much has changed in our community as it relates to access to technology education that create paths to meaningful employment or the ability to purchase affordable natural/organic food. 


Meanwhile, the fast-paced growth of technological innovations has drastically changed the way many people work.  Very few companies have limited resources to properly train their employees to keep up with the changes.  And workers don't have the time and/or money to commit to traditional courses.  Online classes are often not comprehensive enough.  

As a result, many jobs become obsolete and employers are hiring younger, tech-savvy people who work for less.  And the glass ceiling is thickest for women and minority communities - even if we do get the degrees, we still do not get hired. 

The other critical challenge is that despite the fact that the local restaurants may offer relatively healthy meals they are limited in scope.  The over-prevalence of fast food chains, bodegas, and delis are major factors in making cheap junk food available to people with limited budgets.

We are ready to take on those challenges and empower ourselves while we empower our community.  

Risks & Challenges

If we don't get the minimum of $25,000 which secures a lease, we will put whatever available funds into a savings account, and continue to solicit funds to open the cafe.
We are determined to realize our vision of having a Bits and Bites Tech Cafe in every underserved community of New York City!

 I am a disabled combat Veteran, I was deployed in Iraq for Operation Iraqi Freedom.

My sports line is called Team Hydrate.
I am now being threatened with a law suit by a large corporation, Steel Technology, LLC who have already put one company out of business for a trademark they got that should never have been passed.
The trademark they managed to get passed (after several attempts and several denials) is for an unpainted strip of metal at the top of the bottle under the lid, which their Hydro Flask bottles also have.
The president of the company made a sworn statement in January, 2015 saying as far as he was aware no other company had been using this design. We were selling our bottles before this along with Thermos who have been selling such a bottle since 2012 and several other companies as shown in the video above and the additional images on this campaign.
The untrue statement he gave was the reason the trademark was passed.
We believe in a free market, where large corporations don't get to bully smaller family-run businesses out of the marketplace and would love help from you to stand alongside us as we appeal for this unfair trademark to be reversed.
Your donations will be helping a Veteran continue to work hard to provide for his family. Thank you.   What We Need & What You Get We will be using the funds to appeal this shouldn't-have-been-passed trademark which will cost $2000.

<p>We're so used to hearing everything negative about menstruation - what a pain in the uterus! - but we're here to tell you <i>it doesn't have to be so bad</i>. </p>
<p>We're tired of being told to hide our period or made to feel ashamed of it. We say, let's own it! Not only that, let's celebrate it, honor it, and learn more about it. Because menstruation doesn't need to be just something we dread having to endure every month. </p>

That's why it's so important to keep the momentum going.</p>
<p>Our intention is to continue that conversation, to foster a safe and welcoming platform for socially conscious, period-positive, body-positive dialogue and to create even more opportunities for honoring, celebrating, and learning more about the very natural process that is not only necessary to create life but actually affects us all in so many more ways than we could've imagined.</p>

Happy cycling! </p><p>#cycledork #empoweredperiod #undothetaboo</p></div>","Why Are We Here?

Well, it all started when a man and an ovulating woman really liked each other...kidding! Sort of. We really wouldn't be here without periods and the menstrual cycle, right? So why are we, as a society, so afraid to talk about them?
We're so used to hearing everything negative about menstruation - what a pain in the uterus! - but we're here to tell you it doesn't have to be so bad. 
We're tired of being told to hide our period or made to feel ashamed of it. We say, let's own it! Not only that, let's celebrate it, honor it, and learn more about it. Because menstruation doesn't need to be just something we dread having to endure every month. 
There's so much more to it than that, and it is empowering.Guys, we're talking to you, too!
What Is Cycledork?
We are everything cycle-related (and yes, sometimes we can't help being a bit dorky about it!)
Some have referred to 2015 as the year of the period, and though we've come a long way in terms of awareness and stigma-busting, there is SO much more to do. That's why it's so important to keep the momentum going.
Our intention is to continue that conversation, to foster a safe and welcoming platform for socially conscious, period-positive, body-positive dialogue and to create even more opportunities for honoring, celebrating, and learning more about the very natural process that is not only necessary to create life but actually affects us all in so many more ways than we could've imagined.

For instance:




Did you know more than one fifth of the girls in Sierra Leone miss school because of menstrual stigmas?



Do you really know what's in your feminine products?



Have you heard of the tampon tax?



Are you aware of all  available contraception options?



Did you know PMS is common but not ""normal""?




What is the menstrual cycle, anyway?



Not so sure about all that? No worries, that's why we're here! 
You can also expect to see some great interviews, helpful health and wellness tips, the latest on reusables, cycle apps, and technology (yes, there's period tech news!) and of course, some lighthearted menstrual mirth. We do love us some plucky period humor.
Why Help?
We need your help to show the world menstruation matters. That periods can be empowering.

Women will spend an approximate whopping 3000 days of their lives menstruating - that's over 8 years! - and yet it's still something we aren't welcomed to talk about freely. Worse, there's still so much misinformation out there. 
""Repairing women's relationship to the body through undoing the menstrual taboo and sharing body literacy ought to be foundational to the feminist movement. It reconnects us to ourselves and to the world around us, to each other. It is a vital source of revolutionary power.""  - Holly Grigg-Spall
62 million girls worldwide are not in school. A large part of this has to do with menstrual stigmas.

<p><b>Bike Clinique </b>is a
project to develop a mobile bike shop in<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> an
extra long, super high, and eco-friendliest </span>Volkswagen<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> Crafter available.  We will build a full service state of art bike workshop in the load
compartment. We will use the best tool and equipment in the industry to provide
the most comprehensive bike service. This
project is both eco and ethical. There are a range of awesome and unique perks
to choose from, all proceeds will go to developing our concept shop. The cycling industry is changing and the traditional bike
shop model must evolve. Bike Clinique LTD is the evolution of the tbs. The bike shop
that comes to you at your convenience with parts; accessories and expertise. One on one personal
level of service, when you need it and where you need it. Just book online via
our website or call us. We will be able to perform any
workshop job from this mobile facility and you get your bike straight away. We
come to you, fix or service your bike and you just do what you love, ride!</span></p>
<p><b><i>A
little history </i></b></p>
<p>I’m Freddie, I am a
professional bicycle technician, cycling training instructor and cyclist. I
came from an engineering background where I studied electrical engineering. I
realized my impact would be less profound as a conventional employee so I pursued my
passion of a cycle professional and entrepreneur. I have worked in the cycling
industry for over 6 years and achieved my Cytech 2 certification for about 6 years. Over these years I have developed skills and maintained relationships
with many customers and industry professionals. My aspiration is to progress my
skills and ability to the next level, as an entrepreneur and business pioneer.
In July, I became a dad to the most awesome son and I am more determined than
ever to make Bike Clinique a success. I know that no matter what obstacles I may face, I will make it in this industry.</p>
<p><b><i>Where
will the funds go and our progress so far?</i></b></p>
<p>Our goal for this
campaign is to raise £15K. Approximately £8000 will go towards the lease purchase
of a VW Crafter. </p>
<p>We have some funding
currently and would like to add the remaining contributions made by you to
building our workshop with fixtures and fittings. These include the sunroofs, van
racking and aluminum lining We will also develop a mobile electrical system. The
remaining cash will go towards stocking our workshop with the best quality
parts and accessories. We have secured most of tools and equipment needed for
the workshop.</p><h3><b>Note: Before the launch of this campaign, we have managed to place the order on a bright orange, super high and extra long VW Crafter equipped with euro 6 engine and blue motion technology. It's a 12 week custom build and will be delivered towards the end of May. We need your support more than ever.</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p><b><i>Our
Impact</i></b></p>
<p>We have two principle
aims at Bike Clinique:</p>
<p>Firstly, we bring the
convenience of safe cycling to everyone, no matter how much your bike cost; no longer
waiting weeks with your bike in a repair shop. We bring to our customers’
competitive prices on parts and a full service workshop to their door. We fix
your bike so you do what matters, just ride and stay healthy!</p>
<p>Secondly, we believe in making Britain great again. We believe in
creating entrepreneurs in the bike industry. My experience working in bike
shops created the awareness that professional bike technicians should earn a
decent living with their skills. So, our mission is to empower certified bike technicians
to own their own mobile bicycle pro-shop. Stem from a successful year with your
contribution, we will be designing a franchise-like model which will be a guide
for professional bike technicians to progress into entrepreneurship. We believe
this country was built on such philosophy.</p>
<p>I love working on
bikes, there's always something new to learn or problem solve.</p>
<p><b>The
Perks and to conclude</b></p>

compartment. We will use the best tool and equipment in the industry to provide
the most comprehensive bike service. This
project is both eco and ethical. There are a range of awesome and unique perks
to choose from, all proceeds will go to developing our concept shop. The cycling industry is changing and the traditional bike
shop model must evolve. Bike Clinique LTD is the evolution of the tbs. The bike shop
that comes to you at your convenience with parts; accessories and expertise. One on one personal
level of service, when you need it and where you need it. Just book online via
our website or call us. We will be able to perform any
workshop job from this mobile facility and you get your bike straight away. We
come to you, fix or service your bike and you just do what you love, ride!
A
little history 
I’m Freddie, I am a
professional bicycle technician, cycling training instructor and cyclist. I
came from an engineering background where I studied electrical engineering. I
realized my impact would be less profound as a conventional employee so I pursued my
passion of a cycle professional and entrepreneur. I have worked in the cycling
industry for over 6 years and achieved my Cytech 2 certification for about 6 years. Over these years I have developed skills and maintained relationships
with many customers and industry professionals. My aspiration is to progress my
skills and ability to the next level, as an entrepreneur and business pioneer.
In July, I became a dad to the most awesome son and I am more determined than
ever to make Bike Clinique a success. I know that no matter what obstacles I may face, I will make it in this industry.
Where
will the funds go and our progress so far?
Our goal for this
campaign is to raise £15K. Approximately £8000 will go towards the lease purchase
of a VW Crafter. 
We have some funding
currently and would like to add the remaining contributions made by you to
building our workshop with fixtures and fittings. These include the sunroofs, van
racking and aluminum lining We will also develop a mobile electrical system. The
remaining cash will go towards stocking our workshop with the best quality
parts and accessories. We have secured most of tools and equipment needed for
the workshop.Note: Before the launch of this campaign, we have managed to place the order on a bright orange, super high and extra long VW Crafter equipped with euro 6 engine and blue motion technology. It's a 12 week custom build and will be delivered towards the end of May. We need your support more than ever.

Our
Impact
We have two principle
aims at Bike Clinique:
Firstly, we bring the
convenience of safe cycling to everyone, no matter how much your bike cost; no longer
waiting weeks with your bike in a repair shop. We bring to our customers’
competitive prices on parts and a full service workshop to their door. We fix
your bike so you do what matters, just ride and stay healthy!
Secondly, we believe in making Britain great again. We believe in
creating entrepreneurs in the bike industry. My experience working in bike
shops created the awareness that professional bike technicians should earn a
decent living with their skills. So, our mission is to empower certified bike technicians
to own their own mobile bicycle pro-shop. Stem from a successful year with your
contribution, we will be designing a franchise-like model which will be a guide
for professional bike technicians to progress into entrepreneurship. We believe
this country was built on such philosophy.
I love working on
bikes, there's always something new to learn or problem solve.

Fe Climbing Center has heard the call that has been sounding in the Northern
New Mexico climbing community for years. Climbers of all ability levels have
been hoping for a bigger and better facility, which would allow for a larger
square footage, greater diversity of lines, an expanded training area,
increased programmatic options, and a generally awesome climbing environment.
Due to the challenges of finding the right location and building, as well as
the huge financial commitment this presents, this has been a work in progress
and personal mission for Andre over the last few years. As many of you already
know, we have secured a location for a climbing facility with over 6,000 square
feet of space. We have collaborated with gym design company ""Vertical
Solutions"" for the creation of a dynamic and challenging gym environment.
In addition, we are working with a contractor to bring together all of the
elements which will make this project a reality.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455665696/efu9d8akabv369nvfc29.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><b>We have now reached a very challenging point in the process where
unexpectedly higher expenses are adding a hiccup to progress.</b> <br/><p>Initial quotes
for making our vision a reality were significantly lower than the amounts that
will be required to bring certain elements of the gym space as we originally
envisioned to fruition. Most notably, the extension of the roof poses a
formidable financial obstacle. 
Currently, the building's ceilings are 25 feet tall. Our goal is to
raise the roof an additional 15 feet. This piece of the project alone will
require an additional $135,000 more than what was originally quoted by
contractors. Because of this significantly increased expense, we are seeking
additional funding through several avenues to help us address this financial
challenge. <br/></p><b>Our goal in this fundraising campaign is to raise money to put
toward the following elements:</b><br/><ul>
<li>15 foot vertical extension of the building's roof (in one of the
three bays of the building)</li>
<li>

Great, seamless flooring design for bouldering areas
</li>
<li>Additional holds by companies like Rock Candy Holds, Kingdom
Climbing Holds, Kilter Grips, and Element Climbing to fill in the additional
climbing surface that will be available.<br/>
</li>
</ul><p>All of these improvements amount to $190,000. Through this
Indigogo campaign, we are striving to raise $110,000 in the hopes of carrying out our desired vision.</p>
<p><i>We know that regardless of whether we are able to raise this
entire sum, the new gym will be an incredible climbing space.</i> <i>However, it is
obvious that without some additional funding stream, some of the above design
elements will simply not be possible and we will need to take a different
approach to designing the space. </i></p>
<p><b>We very much appreciate the kind words, patience and support of
the climbing community throughout this process.</b> </p><p>We are confident that this
space will continue to offer a place to nurture our vibrant and caring
community of friends and climbing buddies. If you are able to contribute
financially to this endeavor, it will be gratefully applied to the elements
described above. Please share our campaign with friends, family, climbing supporters,

</p><p>My name is Martin Leigh, the usual car nut who has
worked in the motor trade since 1989, after leaving school and I jumped on the
spanners as a trainee like many young lads. Spent my time at college getting my
(as it was back then) City &amp; Guilds and ever since then I had the desire to
build my own car. But the funny thing is that none of the available kit cars
took my fancy, they never seem to look like production cars. I think we all
wish to own a true sports car and truly know for most of us that we will never
afford a car with the speed and looks of the likes of Ferrari, Lamborghini or
now Pagani. Even now in the
time since leaving school many years ago new companies have moved supercars
into a new league of hypercar like Koenigsegg and Bugatti. So I decide if I
was ever going to design a car to build it needs to look and perform like a
supercar for the price of a top end kit car and could be produced with an
option list that would mean no two cars produced were the same. A car as
individual as the owner, built to the customers budget if they have one. It
would also help the local businesses of production, increase employment and
also be the only car produced in Wales. </p>
<p>The design of the chassis itself will be in three pieces
with the passenger cell being of a universal design, meaning smaller or larger
2 seater sports cars could be
designed around it. Power could also come from other means like all electric or
hydrogen cells, the possiblities could be endless.
This is also the reason unlike many supercar companies I didn’t use my surname
(one it isn’t as interesting), I wanted to inspire great thinking and one of Britian’s great thinkers was
Sir Isaac Newton. Grav80 takes it’s name from this man’s greatest works and
part of the cars shape is created for maximum down force, let gravity do the
rest.  We have created enough CAD information to produce the body,
chassis, interior and at least 4 versions which could take us 5 years down the
line with plans for another 5 versions beyond that. We have rough sketches too
for a hypercar, 4 cylinder roadster
and family hatchback, saloon (sedan) and estate. </p>
<p>But Grav80 is where the adventure begins, we would be
using Ford Motor company as our parts bin using trusted engines, gearboxes and
brakes from the top end performance models in their stable. We have a list of
companies ready to supply us with all the bespoke items needed to make Grav80
happen and make them as individual as the customer wishes. Please enjoy the
images we have created for you and the information we feel makes sense of our
goal.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444572787/s9wdiqholco3rkwkm9cg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444572814/cy1hx1asy6hg1c1tleal.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Original design sketches by Ernesto Freitas of Lusomotors in Portugal <br/><a href=""www.lusomotors.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.lusomotors.com</a><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444574275/jj45j8ncbmldyw4jmzws.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444477438/ffudmuhaam5m49frjsol.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>

Our Story
 
     The RiverSands and the Walla Walla Whiskey Company (our two brands) story is truly about quality in our Craft.  We are not novices at doing this, we have devoted more years then we will admit to, perfecting our recipes to be the finest sipping spirits. One Lady and two Men who believe its all about the process, the love and commitment in making the best Spirits that will have the privilege of sliding past your lips.       RiverSands Distillery began in 2011 with the goal, as with any new business, to be successful with our craft.  The devoted crew produced our first bottle of Vodka and Gin in 2013.  Its now been three years since we started producing and we have expanded our products to include whiskey and liqueurs.  In 2015 we won Bronze for our Honey and Rosemary Liqueur in the national SIP competition.        We do have distribution in the State of Washington, but it's not enough.  We need to have walk-in business also and this is where you can help.  It is now time to expand our product offerings and build our tasting room in Downtown Walla Walla, located right in the middle of wine country.  We humbly need your help to make this a dream come true.  All the folks involved with the day to day operations have proven we can successfully manage this company however, we just don't posses the  additional capitol to take it to the next level that will secure our brand success.  With your help, this can become a reality.

<p>Hey there folks! We are Intergalactic Brewing Company and we are starting this campaign to gain funding for new equipment in our tasting room, but we want to do this while crafting beer side by side with those that are contributing to our campaign. If we meet this goal, we are going to use the funds to add things that will allow us to improve our customers’ experience and our craft, by broadening the types of beer we can serve and the way we serve them in our tasting room. Not to mention this is a great opportunity for people who contribute to leave their mark on the San Diego beer community and get to know us better! Intergalactic Brewing Company started as a passion project of self professed nerd and award winning homebrewer Alex Van Horne on April 17th 2013. What began as a single unit dual purpose tasting room/brewery with one employee has evolved into a seven person operation spanning several units through out the original business park. As we have grown, we have strived to contribute to the world’s craft beer scene here in San Diego while still having fun. Now we are at a point where we want to continue doing that by adding a Cask program, a Crowler machine and even a Randall, if possible. All of these items are going to be used in the tasting room to create a better experience for all who visit! What we need to take the tasting room to the next level is $10,000, with all the money we raise going towards your perks and our new equipment. Any money that is extra will be put towards additional brewery equipment expansion and tasting room improvements. If we don't reach our full goal we will use our funds that were raised to purchase what we can (if it's just enough for the cask program, we will just get the cask program until we can purchase the Crowler machine as well and vise versa). Your contribution will help one of San Diego's smallest breweries provide some of the unique experiences that until now only the bigger breweries could provide! Even if you can't donate a lot just sharing our campaign can be a huge help in us getting to where we need to be! Thank you for your contributions each one no matter what size means a-lot to all of us. </p>

<li>$5,000 allows us to install four big kitchen sinks, prep tables, additional refrigeration and seating.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>When we say this is <i>your</i> Homefield, we mean that you could and should take pride in what we make with local farm goods. From the beginning, Homefield has connected with our sense of community. Meeting farmers, walking the fields, smelling the freshest of malts, offering the chance for folks to buy into the harvest long before the beer is even made. We own it.<i> But you own it too.</i> This beer is ours. Let's do this together. Joining the jug club puts money in the farmers pockets so they can assure that our malt and hop supplies will keep filling our kettle. </p>

<p></p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our biggest risk is opening without a full pouring license, which we will do if we fall short of our funding goal. This will amount to a slower start, but we will pour revenue into the the remodeling required to get our taproom. Since we make great beer with the freshest ingredients, patience will be well rewarded. </p>
<p>Other Ways You Can Help</p>
<p>If you can contribute, you will feel great that you're helping build a community asset. If you can't, but you still want to help, please share our campaign with your friends. And thank you.</p>

Local malt

Local hops

Beer from here
\
So fresh you want to slap it. 

This is YOUR Homefield

Local veggies and artisanal cheese

Fresh breads, fermented pickles, kraut, and more

Music that's fresh and local just like you

Join us in making this real

A few of the of the luscious Homefield batches made at our partner breweries and enjoyed by many:

And yes we hope to continue collaborating with our many great friends in the brewing community, but we need a base of operations in order to keep this beer in on tap. Help us build a place to call home for truly local beer.
 

What We Need & What You Get

In short we need money. We could open as a tasting room selling bottles to go, but our space is so cozy and rustic we want folks to be able to relax and enjoy. 

But to pour pints, as well as world class northeast grown wines and ciders, and serve soups, and cheese plates and other farm to table grub, we need to install a lot more plumbing. In fact, plumbing will be our most expensive budget item. 


$5,000 allows us to install four big kitchen sinks, prep tables, additional refrigeration and seating. With all that, plus our state of the art 1 barrel brew kettle, four 2 barrel fermenters, a brite tank and other brand new equipment, we will have a truly unique place - authentic farm to table and sustainable in every way.

If we fall short of our entire goal, we will still honor all of our perks. The rest of the funding will be used toward our ultimate goal. It will just take us a little longer to get there.

</h3>Hi everyone! My name is Desirae Ross.  Owner of Occasion Favorz, the heart and sole of my creativity.  I enjoy the pleasure of helping other create the perfect theme of their event.  From baby showers and birthdays to graduations and weddings.  Being creative has always been in my genes and I am always excited at the ability to be able to create something using my hands.  Right now I work out of a small space of my basement.  So just imagine a 12'x9' space with tons of supplies from favors, balloons, a helium tank, gift baskets, accessories and a mini workstation for my creations.  I do what I can with what I've got but Occasion Favorz needs a real home.<br/><br/>The ideal store front for Occasion Favorz is a nice location in my Queens neighborhood on a block with everyday foot traffic from potential customers needing supplies, decorations and services to plan their special occasion.  There are a few locations that I have found for rent now whose monthly rent is between $1,500 and $2,400 a month.  Taking in account about $1,000 for insurance costs and a 2-month security deposit between $3,500 and $4,800 and $15,000 for renovations, inventory and cash flow for the first 6 months.  We're looking at between $20,000 and $25,000. <br/><br/>Right now, I have about $4,000 saved up but I still have a long ways to go. Yeah, I've got my work cut out for me but I just know that acquiring a store front will give Occasion Favorz the exposure it needs for customers to see up close our creative ability and the services we offer.  And...ultimately what I also want to establish within Occasion Favorz is a solid event planning service, balloon and gift basket deliveries and the
 opportunity maybe once or twice a year, to have a contest where we 
offer someone the chance to have us sponsor their event at no
 cost.  Having that ability to make the connection with potential customers on a regular basis just makes what I do more rewarding and fun.  You get to hear and be a part of the excitement of their events before and after.  I would definitely have a greater ability to sell seasonal items where the variety is right in front of you as you pass by. Having this store brings all of my inventory to one place, provides the space to work and allows customers to browse. It definitely would be enough space for balloon displays, event planning ideas and eventually giving our customers a how to session so that they too can use their creative instinct.  An absolutely solid space to operate and create...the right way!<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Will Get</h3> <p>So what do I need.  I know it's a lot to take in but I'm looking to raise between $20,00 and $25,000 to get the ball rolling.  This can potentially cover most costs for up to 6 months.  What would this include: monthly rental space, business insurance costs, inventory, cash flow and minor renovations that are necessary right now for the business to operate properly.  Any additional funds will be retained for additional cash flow, marketing and promotions.<br/></p>
<p>Without a doubt any funds that come in will help towards my business.  Even if we fall shy of our goal we will continue to push forward and grow. So, business will continue, any funds that come in will definitely help with inventory (space may be limited but where there's a will there's a way), marketing, promotions and the ability to create more.</p>
<p>And you?  Of course none of this would be possible without your help.  That's why we have perks, perks and more perks for you to benefit from.  Now of course, if you are local in Queens, Brooklyn, and the Bronx, New York, you would be able to experience the perks that would involve balloon decorating for occasions and balloon deliveries but there are many other perks that can be received world wide, like our custom gift baskets, discounts on custom party favors, ribbons and supplies, Occasion Favorz promotional items like stickers, coasters, coffee mugs, cups, key chains and more.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>Your Impact..My Growth!<br/>
</h3> <p>Yes. Every little bit counts, every little bit helps.  Your contributions will help Occasion Favorz grow tremendously. Whether it goes towards a new location, more supplies, better marketing or more promotions. Everyone wants the opportunity to either have something unique for their event and have that one place that they can get it all done at. That's what Occasion Favorz was created to do. Having the ability to be a part of someone's special occasion or event and even if for one day make a difference in their lives, is something that is far more rewarding.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> Obviously a new venture like a store front comes with risks and challenges.  Some things that come to mind is pricing coupled with variety of inventory. Visual presentation, local area preference, convenience and customer satisfaction. These risks are something that will happen everyday when opening any business, to answer the question why should I purchase from you and not them? Then there is also the risk of not achieving the funds necessary.  While there's always the possibility of not achieving, you still continue to move forward.  You can always utilize what you receive somewhere to help your business grow. Although not necessarily a challenge but a necessity, being able to provide excellent customer service both in store and online.  One of the key aspects of any business is listening to what the customer wants, bringing out their vision and being responsive. Right now, its primarily myself handling all the aspects of the business but I know that I do have the help of family to help with the physical aspects of setup and making the store front operational.</p>
<p>My background in office administrative definitely gives me an edge on being able to structure and operate my business.  Through many years of working with different industries and being the leader in administrative support, computer information systems and marketing, I have no doubt that my experiences, knowledge and drive will allow me to provide the ultimate setting for my store front that will help my business succeed, prosper and grow beyond limitations. I continue to learn and grow through mini online courses in business and finance, in addition to friends who currently have and are also running their own business. Overcoming these hurdles and challenges will take countless hours of planning, strategizing, guts and drive.  These things that will not happen over night and will continue to happen over the course of time which is why having a business plan will help to not only keep structure but focus.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Money is tight and I understand.  In today's world almost every penny has been allocated somewhere.  So, what do you do when you can't donate...Like Us! That's right.  Like us, friend us on Facebook, Visit Our Blogspot, Tweet About Us, Share our Pinterest Photos and Ideas...Help us spread the word about Occasion Favorz and use the Indiegogo Share Tools.  Occasion Favorz is on the rise and we need your help!  All support is welcomed support! <br/></p>
