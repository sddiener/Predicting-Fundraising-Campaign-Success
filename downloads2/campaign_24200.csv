</h3></div>","About ""Desire & the Sea""


Edgar Oliver is a legendary actor, playwright and poet who has been active in New York's downtown theatre community since the 1980's.  Over the past thirty years, he has produced a body of work that the New Yorker's  Hilton Als calls ""emotionally grand."" 
As a playwright and stage actor, he has written and performed in plays that were regularly staged at La MaMa and other downtown venues.  He has also been a sought-after actor in a myriad of other plays, most notably with the Axis Theatre Company under the direction of Randy Sharp.  
Among his most important achievements are three acclaimed one-man shows: East 10th Street: Self Portrait with Empty House (directed by Randy Sharp); Helen & Edgar  (directed by Catherine Burns); and most recently, In the  Park (also directed by Randy Sharp).   The In his review of East 10th Street, the New York Times' Ben Brantley called Edgar ""a living work of theatre all by himself.""   He later described Helen & Edgar  as ""utterly absorbing,""   And Hilton Als called In the Park ""...enthralling...a love story about moments and sensations.""  
Edgar is also one of the most beloved storytellers at The Moth.   

In 2011, Edgar began a performance collaboration with The Octave Doktors.  On April 28, 2014, Edgar and the Doktors performed a concert of poems and readings at Sideshows by the Seashore on Coney Island.  It was the latest in a long line of collaborations between Edgar and the Doktors.  The evening's program brought together the music of the Doktors with a selection of Edgar's poems and monologues from plays spanning the past twenty-five years, including Summer   and Motel Blue 19, all focused on the themes of longing and the sea.   


It was an exceptional evening of poetry and prose featuring haunted swimming pools, a talking undertow, a ship of words,  a macabre road trip, and moments of urgent longing.  The evening's program represented a high point in the artistic collaboration between Edgar and the Doktors.

The Doktors have successfully recorded and produced two albums of their music, and have recorded and uploaded many of the pieces they've created with Edgar.  They are now preparing an album of the spoken word and musical content from Desire & the Sea, along with a number of other collaborative pieces.     
Edgar and the Doktors need to raise $1,300.00 for the costs related to creating the album.

<p>We were selected to be a part of Orlando's 2013 Fringe Festival but need a little help getting there. We're producing Lesyle Headland's wickedly hilarious play <em>Bachelorette</em>.

<li>Festival Application Fees</li>
<li>Props </li>
<li>Costumes</li>
<li>Lighting and Sound</li>
<li>Rights to do the production</li>

<p>If we reach our goal we get to keep all our money and Indiegogo only gets 4% comission. If we don't reach our goal they get to keep 9% of the funds. Plus with your help we will be able to create a fully produced production. Not only will the show be great but you'll be supporting young artists and our dreams! </p>

<p>Hi my name is Eden, &amp; I'm a dancer. To be specific, I dance ballet.</p>
<p>I live in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It's a great city with a lot of support for the arts. Great music, great theatre, great museums &amp; galleries. But what Minneapolis doesn't have is a reputable ballet company with a summer intensive training program for young dancers like me. That’s why my acceptance to the Boston Ballet School's Summer Intensive program is a great opportunity to get advanced training from professional dancers, choreographers, and connect with other young dancers like me.</p>
<p>My expectations weren’t set on being accepted when I auditioned because there are lots of great dancers trying to get spots in summer intensives. It’s tough to get accepted and invited to attend. It surprised me when The Boston Ballet School emailed me to invite me to their summer intensive program, and I was being moved into a higher age bracket alongside accomplished dancers.</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need - And What You Can Expect</h3> <p></p>
<p>Opportunities don’t come without a cost. The summer intensive program is 5 weeks in Boston this summer, and it’s not cheap. I'm here on IndieGogo to raise $6500 for tuition, lodging, and airfare. I won't be able to attend this intensive program without your help.</p>
<p>If you're interested in getting involved with my effort to attend the 2015 Boston Summer Intensive, I want to thank you in advance. If you back my campaign you'll receive emailed updates every week. Depending on which perk you select you'll have access to video, images, and even prints from ballet-themed concept art I'm developing with Miles Heille; my brother and professional lens-wielder.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Make A Difference</h3> <p>Ballet summer intensives are an essential part of a dancer’s development. The opportunity to work with world renowned choreographers, trainers, and other dancers with similar passion and focus will prepare me for a professional career in ballet. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Your support makes you an awesome human who values the artistic and physical  discipline of ballet, and a supporter of the arts in general!</p>
<p>Your help extends beyond this campaign. If this is successful I want to share my experience with other dancers to help them take advantage of their opportunities that may be out of financial reach. My story, which hopefully is the story of a network of friends like you working together to get this done, can encourage others and demonstrate a practical method to accomplish the goal.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>What Can Go Wrong &amp; How To Manage It</h3>
<div></div>
<p>Opportunities are wonderful, but they always have an element of risk. I face a risk in falling short of meeting my goal. I have family members with successful crowdfunding experience who are helping me put together and monitor my campaign. They've offered to jump in and offer more exposure and ideas if needed. I've selected flexible funding here on Indiegogo that allows me to put pledges toward my goal whether or not the full target is reached.</p>
<p>Ballet is an athletic activity, and can expose dancers to injury. In November and December of last year I worked very hard to recover from nerve damage in my shoulder, just in time to dance the lead in The Nutcracker. If you've experienced physical therapy you know there's no guarantee to the process, but you won't improve if you don't give it your best effort. Thankfully I've had a full recovery. Injury is always a risk, but my instructors and I work hard to keep me conditioned and in proper technique to prevent injury from happening again.</p>

ALL-IN PRODUCTIONS
sets down its roots in the east to create new theatre made differently.

We are going to produce for the
stage Phil
Johnson’s locally set story ‘The Little Blue Boat and the Secret of the
Broads!’ in May 2015 for a small scale regional tour. This tales sees Able Sea
Bear charter his way through the Norfolk Broads making friends and having an
adventure on the way. These performances will be accompanied with free drama
workshops for children from all back grounds to engage in and learn more about
acting, signing, describing and working with disabilities. A teacher of the
deaf ‘this is great, Oliver [a Deaf child] is really excelling; everyone is
speaking his language for the first time ever’.
This is the second project from All-In
Productions; the first a research and development of this story was made
possible by a grant from Norfolk County Council and was supported using public
funding by the National Lottery through Arts Council England. The first project
explored the techniques needed to attempt to stage a performance for audiences
who are Deaf, visually or hearing impaired, this culminated in a successful
scratch production which we are now mounting into a fully realised stage
performance.
   What We Need  We need your support to fund for a communication support worker in the rehearsal room to work with the actors on a sign integrated performance. This £1750 will cover these costs and enable the company to improve the level of accessibility of the performance which is set to perform around the East.

<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 10px; font-weight: normal;"">We're the Dead Arts Society (DAS), a UC Davis student organization focusing on producing original works of student written theatre. At the moment, we're working to fund our Spring Quarter Theatre Festival consisting of two original full-length plays and two one-act plays, one of which is a musical! With about thirty performers and countless other students involved as writers, directors, and stage managers, we're hoping that YOU can help bring these original student-written pieces to life!</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>We Need Your Help!</h3>
<p>In the past, we've performed our shows in a relatively small theatre that seats approximately 60 people. If the audience fills up (which it often does), though, we're forced to turn people away. This quarter, however, we didn't want to deny anyone the opportunity to see these four incredible shows, so we decided to rent a larger theater! Larger spaces, however, are more expensive and since we never charge for tickets, we need your charitable donations to make these plays a reality! Any contribution (seriously -- even $1) helps us get one step closer to making these plays accessible to everyone as well as encouraging the incredible creativity and artistic talent of all UCD students!</p>
<h3>More About The Plays...</h3>
<p><em>Dinner</em>, written by John Malin, is a farcical comedy about a nice family dinner that goes horribly wrong. Harold has invited his whole family to a nice restaurant for dinner, at the end of which he plans on (finally) proposing to his girlfriend, Penelope. However, as Harold's family arrives, things start become complicated very fast. Soon it seems clear that no one is quite who they say they are and everyone has something to hide. <em>Dinner</em> features lies, secrets, infidelity, twelve ridiculous characters, and a whole lot of cutlery.</p>
<p><em>Natalie</em> (Micaela Cirimeli)</p>
<p><em><em>The Blood</em></em> <em>Law</em>, written by Rachel Pevsner, is a one-act play about three young adults who set out to change the world—and the trouble they run into during their attempt.  Humorously told with the assistance of ""radio"" and ""television"" announcers, <em>The Blood Law</em> creates a world of the near future where free speech is at a minimum and anything can happen to those who speak out.</p>
<p><em>All Dried Up!</em> (Jenny Adler)</p>
<p>PERFORMANCES</p>
<p>May 31, June 1, 2, 6, 7, and 8 at 8PM in Wyatt Theatre on the UC Davis campus.</p>

<p>Rooster Theatre Company was formed in Kingston
Upon Thames in 2013, by a group of Drama graduates and we have a common belief,
that our productions should be more than 90 minutes of entertainment, but this
ethos has proved shockingly ineffective at turning us into millionaires.</p>
<p><b><u>What we have done</u></b></p>
<p>Since our conception in 2013, we
are working towards building a reputation for performances which take risks and
challenge our audiences. We always try to be
socially conscious without being preachy – reveling in the darker side of human
nature.  Previous productions
include performing in Kingston’s International Youth Arts Festival for three
consecutive years, with Martin McDonaugh’s ‘The Lieutenant of Inishmore’, a
collection of monologues entitled ‘DIY’ and most recently with a pointedly
grotesque reworking of Brecht’s ‘The Exception and the Rule’. From plots and
themes involving terrorism and class-struggle, our work gives us the title of a
political theatre company.</p>
<p>Most recently, we produced an unorthodox
adaptation of the writings of Harold Pinter, <i>See No Evil, Hear No Evil, Speak No Evil</i>. This piece took three of
Pinter’s short plays, ‘Landscape’, ‘One For the Road’ and ‘Silence’, ostensibly
unrelated and written years apart over Pinter’s long career in theatre, and
thrust them together to form a narrative of powerful images and themes. First
performed at Brighton Fringe in May 2014, the performance was lauded for its <b>“slick nature” and “delightful intelligence”</b>
of the direction and how the cast <b>“rose
incredibly to the task of bringing these complex short plays to life”</b>. Chiefly,
though, the piece was commended for “<b>the
initial question they ask themselves and in turn their audience</b>” and its
understanding that <b>“Risk is the nature
of theatre” (New Current)</b>. The piece was also performed at Edinburgh Fringe
in August 2014 and Thessaloniki, Greece the following November. Performed in
one of the leading theatres of North Greece, this bold adaptation of
Pinter was one of the first English language theatre pieces to be staged in
Thessaloniki. Once again we received possitive reactions, with particular praise
given to our efforts to <b>“challenge
their audience’s brains”</b> and for offering <b>“something different to Greek theatre as a whole” (ParalaxiMag)</b>.</p>
<p><b><u>What we are working on now</u></b></p>
<p><b>Our
current piece</b>, <i>The Daily Tribunal, </i>is a devised piece which seeks to bring to life
the otherworldly beast that is the morning newspaper. Directed by Sofia Nakou
and Laura Duffy, it follows the journey of two homeless men (actors Sam Nunes
de Souza and Alex John) who find themselves faced with the unlikely task of
writing a daily article for their local newspaper. The piece mixes a single
narrative with stylised representations of news stories in an attempt to
dissect the dual elements of virtue and vice which flow both into, and out of,
the stories we digest every day. How does good intent give into corruption? Can
journalistic integrity stand tall in a culture of flashy tabloid gossip? And,
most importantly, do we as a society really demand anything better? These are
some of the questions this piece tackles with a dark humour and an unflinching
embrace of human nature.</p>
<p><b><u>And why we need you!</u></b></p>
<p>Our performances to this point have been well-received
and we have lots of projects planned for the next few months, taking us from
London to Edinburgh and Greece, but right now is that special time when we’ll
get by with a little help from our friends (and sorry, but that’s you). Just a
small (or huge) donation will help fund our travel and accommodation, when we perform outside of our humble village of London. Vital
expenses such as marketing, renting venues and keeping ourselves sheltered and
fed in foreign lands have built to a point that social awareness and glowing
reviews can’t quite cover. In short, we need a bit of money. Like all emerging
theatre companies we need support, and likely owing to recent cuts to the arts,
we’ve decided to turn to you!</p><br/></div>","Who we are

Thessaloniki. Once again we received possitive reactions, with particular praise
given to our efforts to “challenge
their audience’s brains” and for offering “something different to Greek theatre as a whole” (ParalaxiMag).
What we are working on now
Our
current piece, The Daily Tribunal, is a devised piece which seeks to bring to life
the otherworldly beast that is the morning newspaper. Directed by Sofia Nakou
and Laura Duffy, it follows the journey of two homeless men (actors Sam Nunes
de Souza and Alex John) who find themselves faced with the unlikely task of
writing a daily article for their local newspaper. The piece mixes a single
narrative with stylised representations of news stories in an attempt to
dissect the dual elements of virtue and vice which flow both into, and out of,
the stories we digest every day. How does good intent give into corruption? Can
journalistic integrity stand tall in a culture of flashy tabloid gossip? And,
most importantly, do we as a society really demand anything better? These are
some of the questions this piece tackles with a dark humour and an unflinching
embrace of human nature.
And why we need you!
Our performances to this point have been well-received
and we have lots of projects planned for the next few months, taking us from
London to Edinburgh and Greece, but right now is that special time when we’ll
get by with a little help from our friends (and sorry, but that’s you). Just a
small (or huge) donation will help fund our travel and accommodation, when we perform outside of our humble village of London. Vital
expenses such as marketing, renting venues and keeping ourselves sheltered and
fed in foreign lands have built to a point that social awareness and glowing
reviews can’t quite cover. In short, we need a bit of money. Like all emerging
theatre companies we need support, and likely owing to recent cuts to the arts,
we’ve decided to turn to you!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

graduate of Lewis Cass Technical High School in Detroit, MI. I am the
sole-creator, co-writer, co-director,  and actor in my original production
of “Junior”. Coming out of high school I was presented with two choices. One
follow the crowd and go to college, or two, go out into the world and follow my
dreams.  I picked the less popular one.  With the support of friends
and family my dreams of having my first production is coming to
existence.  “Junior” is a play that uses the combination of original
monologues and scenes to portray the relationship or lack thereof between sons
and their fathers. <br/><p></p><p>
</p><p>$50,000 seems like it’s a lot of money, well because it is. In
order to put on this production we are presented with a prodigious quantity of
problems. One is finding a space that we can perform in on a regular basis.
Either the theatre cost too much for us or they don't have enough dates that we
need to put on our run. We usually have been running on a shoe string budget but
we have been prevailing. All of our costumes we bring from home, a lot of times
borrowing clothes from other cast mates. We have a minimal set because we don't
have the funds or the means to make our own. If we can reach our goal of
$50,000, we will be able to put on a two month run of our show. From there we
can take it on the road so more people can be touched by this powerful message,
and see the importance of the ""father-son relationship"". After that
possibilities are endless. We intend to take this show to New York but one step
at a time.</p>
<p>The reason I believe that this show is unlike any other and can
have such a huge impact on our society is because it is and it has already (on
a much smaller scale). My writing partner and I took it upon ourselves to do
our best to break boundaries and make this show different than anything that we
know of. Every time we put on this production we have make it more extravagant
and art orientated. We are trying to bring all forms of art into this show so
it will become an experience that our audience will leave filling
full. These stories are all true stories or based off true stories. I
wanted to write and finish this project because I feel that as young black men
we don’t speak up for ourselves, we tend to bottle emotions inside (because
“real” men don’t cry). I want to give these young men a voice, and erase or
justify all stereotypes that us as young black men have stamped on our
foreheads. The cast itself is filled with all young black men ranging from
16-25 years of age. All these stories in one way or another can relate to
someone else in their lives.</p>
<p>We are not just asking for money, we are asking for support and
fans. We need people that will spread the word and ensure that this show will
grow and prosper. No dollar amount is too small, no amount of support is too
little. We as a cast would like to thank you in advance for even considering to
help us.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/366886/files/20140212163219-Jr._Smile.jpg?1392251539"" src="""" style=""""/></p><a href=""http://pushnevahda.com/jr/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Donnevan Tolbert(19), Malcolm Harris (18), Antonio Jeffries (16), Devin Laster (25), Brandon Haugabook (18), Brandon Foxworth (17) </a><br/><p></p><br/><p></p></div>","My name is Malcolm Harris, I am 18 years old and am a recent

know of. Every time we put on this production we have make it more extravagant
and art orientated. We are trying to bring all forms of art into this show so
it will become an experience that our audience will leave filling
full. These stories are all true stories or based off true stories. I
wanted to write and finish this project because I feel that as young black men
we don’t speak up for ourselves, we tend to bottle emotions inside (because
“real” men don’t cry). I want to give these young men a voice, and erase or
justify all stereotypes that us as young black men have stamped on our
foreheads. The cast itself is filled with all young black men ranging from
16-25 years of age. All these stories in one way or another can relate to
someone else in their lives.
We are not just asking for money, we are asking for support and
fans. We need people that will spread the word and ensure that this show will
grow and prosper. No dollar amount is too small, no amount of support is too
little. We as a cast would like to thank you in advance for even considering to
help us.Donnevan Tolbert(19), Malcolm Harris (18), Antonio Jeffries (16), Devin Laster (25), Brandon Haugabook (18), Brandon Foxworth (17)",1.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p><strong><em>YEAR of the HIPPO</em></strong> began one year ago with development throughout the summer and fall of 2012. It is a play about our generation’s version of the American Dream and takes place in the year following college graduation in a world clouded with daunting doubt—and college debt. We are the most talked about generation in the media today and this play comes from those experiencing these issues first hand. Something must change with the educational system or our generation will be defined by <strong>money</strong> and <strong>luck</strong>.

<p><strong>Scripts takes place from the 8th-14th September</strong><br/><strong>Co-Produced by Birr Theatre and Arts Center and Jasango Theatre</strong></p>
<p>    Scripts is a festival dedicated to new Irish plays—the writing of them, the development and nurturing of them. Playwright's have submitted original 15 Minute plays on the theme ""Home"".  Those selected will benefit from a professional development process where they will be mentored by professional playwright <strong>Eugene O' Brien</strong> in an exciting workshopping process. Also included in the festival is a fully produced radio play, pop up plays around the town of Birr, writing workshops for adults and teens, and a final performance of the chosen plays. (Winning playwright announced following performances!) Check out <a href=""http://www.scriptsireland.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.scriptsireland.com</a> for more details!</p>
<p><strong>Writing Workshops will be led by Christian O'Reilly and Phillip McMahon</strong>, extremely successful and talented professional playwrights in Ireland who we are thrilled to have working with us!</p>

Also included in the festival is a fully produced radio play, pop up plays around the town of Birr, writing workshops for adults and teens, and a final performance of the chosen plays. (Winning playwright announced following performances!) Check out www.scriptsireland.com for more details!
Writing Workshops will be led by Christian O'Reilly and Phillip McMahon, extremely successful and talented professional playwrights in Ireland who we are thrilled to have working with us!

It was 2007 when I was first introduced to these amazing children, when they were starting out as students at a new performing arts school, in the countryside within the Angkor Wat World Heritage park. 
I marveled at their elegance, poise and control even then.
But after 6 years of rigorous training under the guidance of the Conservatoire’s Royal patron and their dedicated teachers, these extraordinary young dancers and musicians have been transformed into swans.
On 2 accounts, I am so proud!! As a Cambodian adopted in the UK and a Trustee of Nginn Karet Foundation for Cambodia (NKFC) - the nonprofit responsible for the Conservatoire.
What an incredible transformation into the Sacred Dancers of Angkor dance and music troupe, after so much hard work!
The Sacred Dancers of Angkor Tour (http://www.nkfc.org/ustour) is important to me for so many reasons. Here are three:


1. Their mission is highly spiritual: to connect Cambodian-Americans to the Motherland during the Buddhist Holy Month of Remembrance and to dance, as is the ancient tradition by sacred dancers, for peace and harmonious world.
The children will be staying with the same local Cambodian communities that have invited them to perform in the Buddhist Pagodas.
2. It will raise awareness of Cambodia’s distinctive centuries-old cultural heritage, which was almost wiped out by the Khmer Rouge.
3. It is a unique opportunity for the students to learn from the cultural exchange workshops organised with prestigious Ballet institutions, as well as with established Khmer dance troupes to bond and share their common experiences and dreams.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>What Makes Us Feel Good begins with a cow attempting to put the audience at ease. In reality, however, this is an actor looking for self validation. We cannot be certain how the audiences at The Tank will respond, but Johnny the Cow will most certainly ignore them. Especially once he has asked them a question. You see, he wants to get to the good stuff. A trauma involving his mother. A lifetime of self doubt. Forgiveness. Anyway, there’s another actor on stage now. They are preparing to present an educational children’s theatre show based on the life of murderer William Bradford Bishop. They are certain that it will be both marketing and compelling. The resulting performance is an amalgam of children’s broadcast programming, live educational theatre, and William Bradford Bishop’s violent acts in Bethesda, Maryland in 1976.</p>
<p>In What Makes Us Feel Good, we meet William Bradford Bishop as he is burning the corpses of his victims and teaching us to spell “grave”.  Along with his loyal pals, Mrs. Teapot and Johnny the Cow, William Bradford Bishop flees from the authorities and searches for meaning in existence. Through it all, William is plagued by flashbacks of his marriage, self loathing thoughts, and visits from a poetic and profound life sized squirrel.</p>
<p>This play is our longest standing collaboration and much of that is owed to the content which it presents. It’s a young play about young people oppressed by their own self hatred and intelligence (or potential lack thereof). In a way, these themes are a microcosm of our growth as artists. Conceived in our earliest and most vulnerable college haze, we’ve worked on it while juggling internships, assistantships, and other personal projects. For better or for worse, and much like some of the characters in this play, we’ve learned to embrace this self doubt and use it as a tool to create the kind of live performance we wish we could see more of.</p>

<p>Special Events (company) is a collaborative co-op that looks to constantly reconfigure its own definition of collaboration. Though the lead artist may change, we are all able to take joint ownership over the work that we present. We are interested in pushing experimentation in the form to greater lengths, which often manifests itself as big shifts in aesthetic or tone between pieces. A major driving force is the impossible quest to find authenticity in theater. Using self prescribed tools like cliche, genre, sound, pop culture, and dance to disrupt a play’s complacency to narrative and form is our way of making theater that is as complex, weird, and self referential as everyday reality.</p>

<p>Brett Evan Solomon (playwright) is a writer and performer based out of New York City. His work as a playwright has been produced or developed through Nylon Fusion Theater Company, The Southampton International Theater Workshop, The Secret Theatre, Dixon Place, Muchmore's, Play Date at Pete's, The Tank, The Brick, Interrobang New Works Festival, Piggies Amusement Complex, The Exponential Festival, and The Drama League.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The majority of the funds we are hoping to raise will be going towards actor/designer stipends and rehearsal space. The entire team has been on board since our first small reading at Dixon Place and we want to make sure we can compensate them. The rest will be spent on costume/prop construction, a singular set piece, volunteer accident insurance, and contingency. Any additional funds we may raise will go to additional marketing material. </p>
<p>We are so excited to share these perks with you, which include spelling lessons with William, a digital tea date with Mrs. Teapot, and our deepest gratitude. </p>

Special Events (company) is a collaborative co-op that looks to constantly reconfigure its own definition of collaboration. Though the lead artist may change, we are all able to take joint ownership over the work that we present. We are interested in pushing experimentation in the form to greater lengths, which often manifests itself as big shifts in aesthetic or tone between pieces. A major driving force is the impossible quest to find authenticity in theater. Using self prescribed tools like cliche, genre, sound, pop culture, and dance to disrupt a play’s complacency to narrative and form is our way of making theater that is as complex, weird, and self referential as everyday reality.
 
Brett Evan Solomon (playwright) is a writer and performer based out of New York City. His work as a playwright has been produced or developed through Nylon Fusion Theater Company, The Southampton International Theater Workshop, The Secret Theatre, Dixon Place, Muchmore's, Play Date at Pete's, The Tank, The Brick, Interrobang New Works Festival, Piggies Amusement Complex, The Exponential Festival, and The Drama League. He has held assistant positions with Young Jean Lee, Rachel Dickstein/Ripe Time, Target Margin Theater, New York City Players, A Collection of Shiny Objects, and Genee Coreno. B.A, Double Major in Theater and Performance/Playwriting and Screenwriting, Conservatory of Theatre Arts at SUNY Purchase College.
 
Gabriel Vasquez (director) is a director, performer, and native New Yorker. He has presented work at Muchmore’s, Dixon Place, The Tank, Vital Joint, and The Brick among others. He was a 2017 resident artist at the Drama League with Brett Evan Solomon's queer reveng tale Such a Tragedy. He began serious work on a new piece titled Minor Kerouac as part of Barton Booth’s Make Room residency on Governors Island this summer. He was last seen performing in SOMEONEPLEASELISTENANDUNDERSTAND (they’re wiretapping our brains) as part of the Exponential Festival. As an assistant director or intern, he has worked with Rachel Dickstein/Ripe Time, The TEAM, The Wooster Group, Sanaz Ghajar, and Sponsored By Nobody. BA, Theater and Performance, SUNY Purchase College. cargocollective.com/gabrielvasquez.
 

What We Need & What You Get
The majority of the funds we are hoping to raise will be going towards actor/designer stipends and rehearsal space. The entire team has been on board since our first small reading at Dixon Place and we want to make sure we can compensate them. The rest will be spent on costume/prop construction, a singular set piece, volunteer accident insurance, and contingency. Any additional funds we may raise will go to additional marketing material. 
We are so excited to share these perks with you, which include spelling lessons with William, a digital tea date with Mrs. Teapot, and our deepest gratitude.

<h3>A sample taste, about us: <br/> </h3>
<ul><li>Our names are  Ifigenia Karamitrou and Korina Gougouli. We are two recent graduates from the National Theater of Greece who are in the process of putting up an art installation inspired by Sarah Ruhl's 'Melancholy Play'.<p>Our ideal wish is to introduce this work to a Greek audience given that it deals with all kinds of issues that are currently at the forefront of this time period. Moreover, the play treats issues of melancholy, depression and sadness in a very fragile and sensitive manner without being dogmatic. So far, we have been successful in completing an adaptation of Ms. Ruhls’ play based on the plays main character 'Tilly'. We've been successful in getting in touch with Sarah Ruhl as well as booking a performance space that has granted us a three month performance time period. Our only set back, as you may have already guessed, is a budget issue. Given that we are two freshly graduated actresses from the National Theater, who decided, (instead of going off to auditions), to have our first step into the theater field be something we wish to create on our own. That said, we are tight on money and are in need of your support. With all the nerve, we decided to get this campaign together to ask for some help. We would be grateful for any money that could be donated. (Cents are welcome as well).</p>

This installation is schedueled to remain in place from the 21st of December to the 26th of February. <br/><br/>The group of people, who are contributing to this project and whom we hope to reimburse are:<br/><br/>Ioli Andreadi, a practicing, talented, young  Director who works in Greece and abroad.

<p>PERFORMANCES: November 1,2,3  9,10  16,17 at 8:00PM and 3:00PM</p>
<p>Actors Fund Art Center<br/>160 Schermerhorn Street, Brooklyn NY 11201</p>

<p>From Producer/Director Claire Beckman:</p>
<h3>
<i>A Muslim in the Midst</i> is a play about fear, prejudice, ideological differences, and our strivings for a common fellowship based on humanity. Despite occurring at the turn of this century, Rao's play resonates during our nation's current immigration crisis and the #metoo movement, as it navigates women's rights, the plight of immigrants and the threat of terrorism, on the human scale of a short road trip. </h3>
<p> </p>
<p>For 15 years Brave New World Repertory Theatre has explored issues of race and social justice in America with acclaimed productions of classics like <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i>, <i>The Crucible, </i><i>A View From The Bridge</i> and <i>The Plantation, </i>based on <i>The Cherry Orchard,</i> set in Virginia in 1870.</p>
<p>As artists we have found that historical distance helps us gain awareness and perspective on issues that remain relevant, and with <i><strong>A Muslim in the Midst </strong> </i>we look to geographical distance to ease our understanding of the complex and painful subject of Islamophobia post 9/11.</p>
<p>I am honored that playwright Anand Rao has entrusted me with his play. The great acting teacher and my mentor Suzanne Shepherd says <strong>""All great works are very near to us, and very far."" </strong>I hope to take the audience on a journey from near to far that will invite a deeper understanding of ourselves, our fears, and how the world changed on that school day 17 years ago. It may be too soon to tell a story about 9/11. This is a story about 9/14/01 in India.</p>
<p>My profound hope for this production is that it will attract Muslim and non-Muslim audience members alike, and that brave individuals will feel safe and welcome enough to stay and engage in talkbacks and audience discussions. If The United States is ""the great experiment"" then Brooklyn is a petri-dish. If the secular, non-partisan Art of Theatre cannot bring Muslims and Non-Muslims together for peaceful discourse in Brooklyn, then is it possible anywhere in the world?</p>
<p><strong>In order for this to succeed we need your support. Annual funding from the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs, if granted, will not be accessible until after our production opens.</strong></p>

<h3></h3>
<p>Five years ago I staged the Canadian premiere of the musical <i>Bare</i>. It was a great success and audiences were moved by it. What many people don't know is that the show, though successfully staged, suffered a huge financial loss and because the show was self-produced, it was my responsibility to shoulder that loss. The cast and crew went unpaid, the balance of the theatre rental went to a line of credit and bridges were burned with personal backers.</p>
<p>It has taken five years, and a lot of retail jobs to finally get back on my feet and to take another stab at staging something awesome. I am a little older and a little more realistic in my endeavours. I've learned from my mistakes and know to ask for help. I would love for my team of awesome and talented people to walk away from this production with nothing but great memories and maybe a little bit of cash for their trouble. Without the funds we hope to raise, we will not be able to offset the overhead production costs enough to make this show happen. </p>

<p>The WatersEdge Theatre Collective is an independent, not-for-profit theatre collective

Canadians or premiering works created internationally in Canada, while giving young
artists an opportunity to perform in a professional, collaborative environment. Originally

Five years ago I staged the Canadian premiere of the musical Bare. It was a great success and audiences were moved by it. What many people don't know is that the show, though successfully staged, suffered a huge financial loss and because the show was self-produced, it was my responsibility to shoulder that loss. The cast and crew went unpaid, the balance of the theatre rental went to a line of credit and bridges were burned with personal backers.
It has taken five years, and a lot of retail jobs to finally get back on my feet and to take another stab at staging something awesome. I am a little older and a little more realistic in my endeavours. I've learned from my mistakes and know to ask for help. I would love for my team of awesome and talented people to walk away from this production with nothing but great memories and maybe a little bit of cash for their trouble. Without the funds we hope to raise, we will not be able to offset the overhead production costs enough to make this show happen. 
WHO (we are) 





The WatersEdge Theatre Collective is an independent, not-for-profit theatre collective
that is committed to producing new works in music, dance and theatre created by
Canadians or premiering works created internationally in Canada, while giving young
artists an opportunity to perform in a professional, collaborative environment. Originally
founded in the Niagara Region, the company moved to Toronto with the Canadian
premiere of the rock musical bare in 2009. 






Gingers in Love is a contemporary, pseudo-sequel to Shakespeare’s A Midsummer
Night’s Dream set in modern day Toronto. Narrated by an ancient Robin Goodfellow, it
tells the story of Aries and Whitty, two star-crossed redheads whose magical love is
the catalyst to a Shakespearean comedy of errors. It features a mix of original folk music
by up-and-coming singer/songwriter Erik Kopacsi (Hair – National Tour, Jesus Christ
Superstar – LOT, Toronto) and classic folk songs from the North American songbook,
woven together with a bitingly witty book by playwright and director Bri Waters (bare,
The Who’s Tommy, Jesus Christ Superstar – WatersEdge, The Rocky Horror Show –
LOT, Toronto). 





   WHAT (we need) $5000!! 
Funds raised will go towards covering:

the design, materials and construction of our set and costumes
the rental of a rehearsal hall
artist fees(!!)
advertising & publicity 
rentals (lighting & sound)

$5000 might not seem like a lot (or enough to cover all of these costs) but it will help our group offset the overhead investment we have already made to make this production a success and bring it to you!

<h3>Why is this important?</h3>
<p>If there's anything I've learned from watching hours and hours of television for academic and professional reasons, it's that this business of show sorely lacks a diversity of voice.

<h3><strong>About Clean - The Musical</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Clean </strong>was first performed as a play with music in 2019 at the Brighton Fringe Festival. It was a huge success, selling out all performances during its run. <strong>Clean </strong>won the New Writing South's <strong>Best</strong> <strong>New</strong> <strong>Play</strong> award. The reviews from both industry and the public were heartwarming and encouraged us to continue with the bigger plan, to bring <strong>Clean - The Musical </strong> to life!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1569694775/qs6wvjkzduzqdrvkvqnb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Clean - The Musical</strong>  explores the lives of seven women living in the historic Roundhill (or Laundry Hill) area of Brighton through different eras, from 1880 to today.  Through each of the characters' stories and the way in which these are interwoven, it highlights common themes and shows how much has - and hasn’t - changed.  The strength and support of sisterhood underpins these women's lives  - from laundry work to women’s hospital to modern female friendships. </p>
<p>Whilst gritty and emotionally powerful, <strong>Clean - The Musical </strong>is a celebration of sisterhood - and as the reviews and audience reactions testify - ultimately uplifting and inspiring.</p>
<p>Perhaps now more than ever in a world where hard won rights are under threat, these stories need to be told.</p>
<p><u><strong>Casting</strong>:</u></p>
<p><strong>Millicent</strong> (50s)  - (1880) Millicent works in the Tivoli laundry. Her children have all left home apart from her youngest who is about to go into service.</p>
<p><strong>Helen</strong> (30s) - (1905) Dr Helen Boyle, founder of the first hospital in England for women with mental illness, with her partner Mabel Jones. Boyle cared for many women who would previously have been sent to the poor house and is celebrated as a lesbian and feminist icon.</p>
<p><strong>Meg</strong> (20s) - (1928) Meg campaigns to encourage local women to vote after universal suffrage.</p>
<p><strong>Dot</strong> (40s) - (1950) Dot’s husband owns a laundry that was involved in the 1950 smallpox epidemic.</p>
<p><strong>Ruby</strong> (20s) - (1977) Ruby is running away from abuse and addiction. She joins a commune in a squat on the Upper Lewes Road.</p>
<p><strong>Juliet</strong> (50s) - (2005) Juliet, a writer, is struggling with the menopause.  Sleepless nights trigger some difficult memories.</p>
<p><strong>Tasha</strong> (30s) - (2018) Single and pregnant, Tasha returns to her now empty family home after living abroad for many years. She sees the area - and her life - through fresh eyes.</p>

<h3>Our Dream</h3>
<p>The one act version of <strong>Clean </strong>included two original songs, written by Simon, and it has been our plan for a while to turn this one act play into a full length musical.</p>
<p>Staging a production of any kind is an expensive business.  The musical version of Clean will require seven actors, along with a number of musicians and other creatives.  We are keen to take our project to the next level, staging a fully professional production next year and using this as a calling card to attract industry support.  </p>
<p>Our dream is to take the stories of these ordinary and renowned Brighton women to the West End.  We’d love you to be part of their journey.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We need to cover the costs of staging a production in May 2020, as part of Brighton Fringe, including the rehearsal time.  Most of this cost is to enable us to pay the singers/actors, musicians and other creatives in line with professional guidelines.  The script and songs are already written, but we do also need to time to develop the orchestration and workshop the new production.</p>
<p>There are also some costs associated with filming the production and creating a promotional brochure.</p>
<p>An outline of the costs is as follows:</p>
<p>Rehearsals (paying cast and crew; renting rehearsal space) - £7000</p>
<p>Promotional materials (filming the show; creating promo pack) - £1000</p>
<p>Fringe costs (registration fee, lighting hire, marketing) - £1000</p>
<p>Staging the show (venue rental, paying cast) - £4000 less estimated tickets sales of £3000 = £1000</p>
<p>TOTAL cost - £10000</p>
<p>If for whatever reason we do not meet our goal, we will still stage the production, but we will have to work with cast on an expenses plus profit share basis, and reduce the budget for marketing and promotional materials.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>There are some great perks on offer, from tickets to an exclusive preview show and 'Clean' t-shirts, to workshops and song-writing sessions, to being an Executive Producer or 'Archangel'.  You can help us with contributions as little as £5.   </p>
<p>Even if you aren't able to support us financially, you can help us spread the work by sharing the campaign using the share tools.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div><h3>Risks</h3></div><div>
<p>We have a strong track record of staging productions with over a dozen successful fringe productions to our name.  The main risk is of not being able to find the right cast with strong acting, singing and playing abilities.  With our reputation, and the ability to pay professional rates, we believe we can attract a great cast.  </p>

Vancouver

<b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: initial;"">The Show</b><br/>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p><i>SHINE: A Burlesque Musical  </i>is an original show with songs by Cass King &amp; John
Woods of <a href=""http://www.wetspotsmusic.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Wet Spots</a>, and script by Cass King and Sam Dulmage. It combines the bawdy comedy of burlesque with a full book musical. It's a smart, sexy night out for grown-ups. <i>SHINE </i>is the
HBO of live musical theatre.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3><b>The Story</b></h3><p>At the crumbling but historic Aristocrat theatre, Shine Mionne and her chosen family of sexpots and misfits struggle to save the theatre from imminent gentrification in the guise of smooth-talking money man Richard Suit. Along the way Frankie, the newbie actor from out of town, and Grace, the dimpled Gender Studies student  are drawn into the vortex of life at The Aristocrat by a diva named Lulu. As Suit and Shine fight for control of the show, Lulu finds her leading-lady status jeopardized by Suit's meddling and a series of whirlwind affairs threatens to throw the impending opening into chaos.</p><p><i>SHINE</i> is a tassel-twirling original musical about an infamous burlesque theatre and the family of talented misfits who try to save it from demolition… or worse, respectability.</p><br/>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>The Goal </b></h3>
<p></p>
<p><b>@ $15,000 </b>- This is the minimum we need to put on our show.  It will cover the basics: venue fees, rehearsal space, minimal advertising and
other pre-show expenses.</p>
<p><b>@ $25,000</b> -
We also cover cast and crew pay, leaving more in the budget to improve the
quality of production, while also giving us more resources to promote and
advertise the show.  </p>
<p><b>@ $30,000 </b>- We
cover MOST of the show's fixed costs, allowing us to do all of the above, plus increasing the pay for our performers and crew. </p>
<p>An
independent show this big can't happen without your support.</p><p><b>Bottom Line: </b>The more you donate... the better we can make this experience for our cast, our
crew, AND our audience.</p><p><br/></p>
<h3><b>Project History </b></h3>
<p></p>
<p><i>SHINE </i>was first conceived by Cass King and John Woods while
on tour with their internationally acclaimed cabaret act <a href=""http://www.wetspotsmusic.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Wet Spots.</a> After
years of performing in burlesque venues around the world, Cass and John wanted
to capture the ragged, glittered glory they found in those tight-knit,
oft-endangered spaces. They joined forces with award-winning actor / playwright / screenwriter Sam Dulmage and began crafting a show.</p>
<p><i>SHINE</i> first hit the stage at the Vancouver Burlesque
Festival in 2009, where it played for two standing-room-only shows and was
the runaway festival hit. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">It then quickly moved across town to The Waterfront Theatre - a commercial 225 seater
in the Granville Island theatre district - where it sold out a two-week run.</span></p>
<p>In July 2010,
<i>SHINE</i> was mounted for a successful
two week run in Seattle, Washington at Theatre Off Jackson. It opened in New
York City in August 2010 at the Ellen Stewart Theater at La Mama, for five
performances in the New York Fringe Festival. </p>
<p>Since 2010,
the creative team has dedicated itself to massive redevelopment of the show –
refining the script, replacing merely catchy songs with utterly irrepressible hits, and preparing for a new production with a full live band. You can hear some of the new material at <a href=""http://www.shinemusical.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the official SHINE website.</a></p><p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>Critical Response:</b></h3>
<p><b>Time Out New York </b></p>
<p>“Hands-down
more goosebumps per minute than any other 
show... It’s ‘RENT’ for our generation... The music is Broadway
calibre... If it doesn’t go on to a longer run, there is no God.”</p><p><b>Stage and Cinema</b></p><p>""<i>SHINE </i>is simultaneously smart and sexy.  The show expertly balances between sincerity and campy send-up, striking notes of nostalgia for vanishing venues while humorously highlighting the missteps that we make when trying to preserve the things we love.""<br/></p>
<p><b>Theatre Is Easy NYC</b></p>
<p>“The show is brilliant: brilliant performances, amazingly
classy dancing, badass vocal performances and all around stellar and crisp
acting. Bottom Line: You do NOT want to miss SHINE: A Burlesque Musical"" ('Can't Miss' recommendation)</p>
<p><b>The Vancouver Courier</b></p>
<p>""Omigawd what
rude fun… It has all the makings of a cult classic.""</p>
<p><b>The Georgia Straight Vancouver</b></p>
<p>""A huge amount
of fun. Everybody on-stage is having a fantastic time and that joy flows,
barrier-free, into the audience. An anthem worthy of Broadway.""</p>

Vancouver



The Show


SHINE: A Burlesque Musical  is an original show with songs by Cass King & John
Woods of The Wet Spots, and script by Cass King and Sam Dulmage. It combines the bawdy comedy of burlesque with a full book musical. It's a smart, sexy night out for grown-ups. SHINE is the
HBO of live musical theatre.The StoryAt the crumbling but historic Aristocrat theatre, Shine Mionne and her chosen family of sexpots and misfits struggle to save the theatre from imminent gentrification in the guise of smooth-talking money man Richard Suit. Along the way Frankie, the newbie actor from out of town, and Grace, the dimpled Gender Studies student  are drawn into the vortex of life at The Aristocrat by a diva named Lulu. As Suit and Shine fight for control of the show, Lulu finds her leading-lady status jeopardized by Suit's meddling and a series of whirlwind affairs threatens to throw the impending opening into chaos.SHINE is a tassel-twirling original musical about an infamous burlesque theatre and the family of talented misfits who try to save it from demolition… or worse, respectability.




The Goal 

@ $15,000 - This is the minimum we need to put on our show.  It will cover the basics: venue fees, rehearsal space, minimal advertising and
other pre-show expenses.
@ $25,000 -
We also cover cast and crew pay, leaving more in the budget to improve the
quality of production, while also giving us more resources to promote and
advertise the show.  
@ $30,000 - We
cover MOST of the show's fixed costs, allowing us to do all of the above, plus increasing the pay for our performers and crew. 
An
independent show this big can't happen without your support.Bottom Line: The more you donate... the better we can make this experience for our cast, our
crew, AND our audience.
Project History 

SHINE was first conceived by Cass King and John Woods while
on tour with their internationally acclaimed cabaret act The Wet Spots. After
years of performing in burlesque venues around the world, Cass and John wanted
to capture the ragged, glittered glory they found in those tight-knit,
oft-endangered spaces. They joined forces with award-winning actor / playwright / screenwriter Sam Dulmage and began crafting a show.
SHINE first hit the stage at the Vancouver Burlesque
Festival in 2009, where it played for two standing-room-only shows and was
the runaway festival hit. It then quickly moved across town to The Waterfront Theatre - a commercial 225 seater
in the Granville Island theatre district - where it sold out a two-week run.
In July 2010,
SHINE was mounted for a successful
two week run in Seattle, Washington at Theatre Off Jackson. It opened in New
York City in August 2010 at the Ellen Stewart Theater at La Mama, for five
performances in the New York Fringe Festival. 
Since 2010,
the creative team has dedicated itself to massive redevelopment of the show –
refining the script, replacing merely catchy songs with utterly irrepressible hits, and preparing for a new production with a full live band. You can hear some of the new material at the official SHINE website.

Critical Response:
Time Out New York 
“Hands-down
more goosebumps per minute than any other 
show... It’s ‘RENT’ for our generation... The music is Broadway
calibre... If it doesn’t go on to a longer run, there is no God.”Stage and Cinema""SHINE is simultaneously smart and sexy.  The show expertly balances between sincerity and campy send-up, striking notes of nostalgia for vanishing venues while humorously highlighting the missteps that we make when trying to preserve the things we love.""
Theatre Is Easy NYC
“The show is brilliant: brilliant performances, amazingly
classy dancing, badass vocal performances and all around stellar and crisp
acting. Bottom Line: You do NOT want to miss SHINE: A Burlesque Musical"" ('Can't Miss' recommendation)
The Vancouver Courier
""Omigawd what
rude fun… It has all the makings of a cult classic.""
The Georgia Straight Vancouver
""A huge amount
of fun. Everybody on-stage is having a fantastic time and that joy flows,
barrier-free, into the audience. An anthem worthy of Broadway.""

<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>We are not a year-round
producer of theatrical events. We are renting the charming <b>Grove Theatre Center</b>
in Burbank (which in addition to offering great seating, provides tons of free
parking both on street and venue lot). The concept calls for minimal settings and modest
costume budgets; we'll be spending the bulk of the budget on theater rental, salaries for the cast, and publicity, so that we can present the music and musical play to its strongest
effect. Since we do not have a subscriber base or permanent mailing list, we
will be marketing this event heavily so that Southern California theatre-going
audiences are aware of it.</p>
<p>If we do not reach our total goal, we will endeavor to produce the show with less funds devoted to
marketing and have to rely on word of mouth. The budget is set to cover the pre-production and running costs for six
weeks.</p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>When INSIDE OUT initially opened in Los
Angeles, it was supposed to run for five weeks. It was a huge hit and ended up
running for five months. It deals with five women in group therapy (and their
therapist). Audiences — women AND men — really respond to it. While this was
written in the late 80s, it was initially presented as a contemporary piece.
Now, twenty years later, it is a period piece. We are embracing its origins
(and relative newness then) and keeping it set in the 80s, which will also
point up its ultimate timelessness.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1116515/files/20141225122234-IO_Zurich_Nightmare2.jpg?1419538954"" src="""" style=""""/></p>INSIDE OUT was recently produced in Zurich,
Switzerland (in English). We were unsure as to how the Swiss people would react
to this piece. Most everyone in Switzerland speaks some English, but their
primary languages are French and German. Plus group therapy is not widely
available there and no one discusses their private or shared psycho-therapy.
Well, the show went over like gang-busters, selling out immediately and
warranting a return engagement six months later. The European audiences ate it
up.

Theatre it was given a valentine rave review in the <i>New</i> <i>York</i> <i>Times</i> by Stephen Holden and has since
been produced all over the country.

relevant today; that people helping people is one of the most valuable things
human beings can do for one another. This is evidenced in the play and,
hopefully, will be evidenced in the production of this play. The frosting on top
of all of this is that a portion of the proceeds from the production will go to
the 1983-founded Dr. Susan Love Research Foundation. This “army of women” is
dedicated to not only finding a cure for Breast Cancer, but as Dr. Love states,
“the key to ending breast cancer is to learn how to stop it before it starts.” </div><div>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>Any kind of theatrical
endeavor is risky. We can start out with the best intentions, best cast, best
direction, and so much depends on audience reaction. To date, there has always been
a wonderful reaction to this show. Many things can dramatically affect the
build of a show like this; weather, financial climate, other theater events at
the same time, and word-of-mouth. We have a relatively short run. Typically
audiences wait to hear what everyone else thinks, then they book tickets. We
will have to rely on great word of mouth and a compelling need to book tickets
immediately. Everyone will have to understand that this is a special event and
limited run.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p></p>
</div>
<p>We realize that many people are hard-pressed
to give money to causes like this and budgets are still strained. There are
other ways to participate and help us make this special event a success:</p>
<p>—<span> 
</span><b>Spread the word</b>. Take postcards and bookmarks
to groups of people who might be interested.</p>
<p>—<span> 
</span><b>Initiate a group.</b> Bring a group of ten and
we’ll give you two free tickets.</p>
<p>—<span> 
</span><b>Host with us.</b> Come to the theater an hour
before show and play “usher” or “usherette” and help us ensure everyone has a
great time at the theater.</p>

</span>Even if you cannot donate at this time, you
can share the information about this Indiegogo campaign. Just forwarding this
information could be helpful if it reaches the right person.</p>

THE PLAN:We
plan to mount a stellar anniversary production of the musical INSIDE OUT (A
musical about giving and getting support in an all-girl “group”) to commemorate
the 20th anniversary and re-release/re-mastering of the Original Off
Broadway Cast Recording. A portion of the proceeds will go to the Dr. Susan Love Research Foundation (for a Future Without Breast Cancer). This show will
be a celebration of women supporting women with an all female cast and all
female band. http://www.dslrf.org/breastcancer/
Our contributors will help us build this fine production with funds
going toward: sets, lights, costumes, theater rental, marketing and cast salaries. The creative staff is donating their participation. This musicals deals
with giving and getting support and finding family in shared interests. 
THE CAST:
It is our intention to assemble a cast of six brilliantly talented and well-known musical theater actresses. So far we have:


Cynthia FerrerA regular on television's General Hospital and Port Charles; appeared in musical versions of: Happy Days, Sleepless in Seattle, 9 to 5, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, Footloose and the Pre-Broadway tour of Turn to the Right.

   What We Need & What You Get 
We are not a year-round
producer of theatrical events. We are renting the charming Grove Theatre Center
in Burbank (which in addition to offering great seating, provides tons of free
parking both on street and venue lot). The concept calls for minimal settings and modest
costume budgets; we'll be spending the bulk of the budget on theater rental, salaries for the cast, and publicity, so that we can present the music and musical play to its strongest
effect. Since we do not have a subscriber base or permanent mailing list, we
will be marketing this event heavily so that Southern California theatre-going
audiences are aware of it.
If we do not reach our total goal, we will endeavor to produce the show with less funds devoted to
marketing and have to rely on word of mouth. The budget is set to cover the pre-production and running costs for six
weeks.   The Impact 
When INSIDE OUT initially opened in Los
Angeles, it was supposed to run for five weeks. It was a huge hit and ended up
running for five months. It deals with five women in group therapy (and their
therapist). Audiences — women AND men — really respond to it. While this was
written in the late 80s, it was initially presented as a contemporary piece.
Now, twenty years later, it is a period piece. We are embracing its origins
(and relative newness then) and keeping it set in the 80s, which will also
point up its ultimate timelessness.

INSIDE OUT was recently produced in Zurich,
Switzerland (in English). We were unsure as to how the Swiss people would react
to this piece. Most everyone in Switzerland speaks some English, but their
primary languages are French and German. Plus group therapy is not widely
available there and no one discusses their private or shared psycho-therapy.
Well, the show went over like gang-busters, selling out immediately and
warranting a return engagement six months later. The European audiences ate it
up.


When INSIDE OUT opened at the Cherry Lane
Theatre it was given a valentine rave review in the New York Times by Stephen Holden and has since
been produced all over the country.


The message inside INSIDE OUT is still
relevant today; that people helping people is one of the most valuable things
human beings can do for one another. This is evidenced in the play and,
hopefully, will be evidenced in the production of this play. The frosting on top
of all of this is that a portion of the proceeds from the production will go to
the 1983-founded Dr. Susan Love Research Foundation. This “army of women” is
dedicated to not only finding a cure for Breast Cancer, but as Dr. Love states,
“the key to ending breast cancer is to learn how to stop it before it starts.”

Risks & Challenges  
Any kind of theatrical
endeavor is risky. We can start out with the best intentions, best cast, best
direction, and so much depends on audience reaction. To date, there has always been
a wonderful reaction to this show. Many things can dramatically affect the
build of a show like this; weather, financial climate, other theater events at
the same time, and word-of-mouth. We have a relatively short run. Typically
audiences wait to hear what everyone else thinks, then they book tickets. We
will have to rely on great word of mouth and a compelling need to book tickets
immediately. Everyone will have to understand that this is a special event and
limited run.   Other Ways You Can Help 

We realize that many people are hard-pressed
to give money to causes like this and budgets are still strained. There are
other ways to participate and help us make this special event a success:
— 
Spread the word. Take postcards and bookmarks
to groups of people who might be interested.
— 
Initiate a group. Bring a group of ten and
we’ll give you two free tickets.
— 
Host with us. Come to the theater an hour
before show and play “usher” or “usherette” and help us ensure everyone has a
great time at the theater.

can share the information about this Indiegogo campaign. Just forwarding this

<p>The Wonderful
Wizard of Oz -- A New Musical </p>
<p>  This
production has been in the works for twelve long years. The writer has been
directing and working on readings of this project since grade school. The
project had five readings in an Off-Broadway Theatre Festival in NYC before
putting up a workshop of that script in 2007 in Seattle, Washington.  </p>
<p>The Workshop helped us see that
we needed to tell the real story of the Book, not of the MGM film. This is how
we have created an action-heavy retelling of an American Classic, with the
freedom to tell a more in-depth story. We have added some lines here and there,
as well as songs from the 1903 Broadway musical, which made Oz a household
name.</p>
<p>Our retelling is more of an
origin story; a true American Tale. The audience will learn about the stories
that helped shape Oz into what it is.</p>
<p>Dorothy’s house falls into Oz,
crushing one of the evil witches who held an evil, terrible reign over the land.
Dorothy has been orphaned and left to live out the rest of her days with her mother’s
twin sister, Emily Blue. She has to learn to put her emotional feelings about
the loss of her City life on hold while she and her little dog travel along a
very dangerous and, at times, murderous Yellow Brick Road.</p>
<p>She learns about how the Wizard was
not the first King of Oz, and how his taking the throne put evil forces into
play. She may be the only hope for a bright and cheery Oz.  The story is the same as you might have read
as a kid, or in school, but with much more to the story than meets the eye or

The Wonderful
Wizard of Oz -- A New Musical 
  This
production has been in the works for twelve long years. The writer has been
directing and working on readings of this project since grade school. The
project had five readings in an Off-Broadway Theatre Festival in NYC before
putting up a workshop of that script in 2007 in Seattle, Washington.  
The Workshop helped us see that
we needed to tell the real story of the Book, not of the MGM film. This is how
we have created an action-heavy retelling of an American Classic, with the
freedom to tell a more in-depth story. We have added some lines here and there,
as well as songs from the 1903 Broadway musical, which made Oz a household
name.
Our retelling is more of an
origin story; a true American Tale. The audience will learn about the stories
that helped shape Oz into what it is.
Dorothy’s house falls into Oz,
crushing one of the evil witches who held an evil, terrible reign over the land.
Dorothy has been orphaned and left to live out the rest of her days with her mother’s
twin sister, Emily Blue. She has to learn to put her emotional feelings about
the loss of her City life on hold while she and her little dog travel along a
very dangerous and, at times, murderous Yellow Brick Road.
She learns about how the Wizard was
not the first King of Oz, and how his taking the throne put evil forces into
play. She may be the only hope for a bright and cheery Oz.  The story is the same as you might have read

Our outstanding instructors, all who have danced professionally on the mainland, share their expertise and passion for their art form with more than 250 students.

They range in age from three to seventy and come from all over the island to learn in a friendly 'ohana (family) atmosphere.

Since 2009 under the direction of Danelle Watson, Alexander Academy has self-produced a full-length show, providing its students a complete dance experience from the ballet barre to the stage.
What We NeedAs a donation-based company, we never turn away a dancer who wishes to participate but lacks the funds to do so. The only requirement for performing in our full-length productions is showing up at the audition and making a commitment to the performance season.
Unfortunately, our belief system does not change the fact that dance is an expensive art form, and this is especially true when putting on a full-length dance show for over 150 dancers!

This Indiegogo campaign is a new addition to the many fundraisers we hold each year to cover our production costs, and we are hoping to raise an additional $3000 to cover the remaining expenses of 2014’s Swan Lake. If we raise more than our goal, the leftover money will fund:

The site will go up in March, and you will be able to follow the creative process as first drafts of music cues begin to appear for different scenes.  And yes, there will be a comments page, and I welcome your input.  Check out the other perks that come with different donation levels.As always, the Festival remains free to the public, but of course we depend greatly on our many fans to contribute at whatever level they're able.  If you can't contribute at this time, share this site freely with anyone who you think might be interested, and by all means come out this summer and enjoy the show!  Be sure and visit the Heart of America Shakespeare Festival website for more details on performance dates: http://www.kcshakes.org",1.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>Funny you should ask...</h3> <ul><li>We are <b>Slightly Altered States</b>, a not-for-profit
theater company made up of actors, writers, and improvisers. We are devoted to
darkly funny, slightly-absurd material that deals truthfully with the
extraordinary in everyday circumstances.  Nobody’s making any kind of
money here, <b>this is all a labor of love, so we believe firmly it should be a
wonderful, respectful, and fulfilling experience for all those involved: our wonderful team and audience alike.</b>
</li></ul>
<br/><ul><li>Our dream of producing <b>Mr Landing Takes A Fall</b> seemed impossible three years ago, let alone seven when the first version of the play was written!  Now it is actually going up at <b>the Flea</b>! Our theater company is three
years old, with critically-acclaimed, sold out, and published productions
behind us, and we are finally ready to present our dream show. We have the play, we have the space, but we can't
do it without <b>YOU! </b>
</li></ul>
<br/><ul><li>
<b>YOU</b> would be a vital part of making this project a

Funny you should ask... We are Slightly Altered States, a not-for-profit
theater company made up of actors, writers, and improvisers. We are devoted to
darkly funny, slightly-absurd material that deals truthfully with the
extraordinary in everyday circumstances.  Nobody’s making any kind of
money here, this is all a labor of love, so we believe firmly it should be a
wonderful, respectful, and fulfilling experience for all those involved: our wonderful team and audience alike.

Our dream of producing Mr Landing Takes A Fall seemed impossible three years ago, let alone seven when the first version of the play was written!  Now it is actually going up at the Flea! Our theater company is three
years old, with critically-acclaimed, sold out, and published productions
behind us, and we are finally ready to present our dream show. We have the play, we have the space, but we can't
do it without YOU! 


YOU would be a vital part of making this project a
reality in this moment of imminent need. We are in the midst of previews and rehearsals and we open in less than a week, and it would mean the world to us if you could help us meet our goal in
time, and be a part of our wonderful, joyous, work-to-the-bone team!

<h2>Sex With Robots?</h2>
<p>Hi! Mariah and Danny here, co-curators of the Sex With Robots Festival, presented by Caps Lock Theatre. What is the Sex With Robots Festival, you might ask? It's a series of short plays about sex with robots! We've got a formidable group of playwrights assembled to write these here plays, and they are: <strong>Mac Rogers, Natalie Zutter, Richard Lovejoy &amp; Eric Meyer, Micheline Auger, J. Julian Christopher, Leah Nanako Winkler, and us...Danny Bowes and Mariah MacCarthy</strong>--plus a song by <strong>Nat Cassidy</strong>. I know, right? You're totally salivating right now. And not just because you're thinking about sex with robots.</p>
<p>It's happening November 5-10, 2013 at the Secret Theatre in Long Island City. And it's going to cost some dollars!</p>
<h2>Here's what we need money for...</h2>
<p>$2,000 for performance space rental</p>
<p>$800 for rehearsal space, props, and costumes ($100 per play)</p>
<p>$200 for postcard printing</p>
<p>$2,000 to pay the artists: So often, in festivals like these, artists work for free, even though it ends up being a crapload of work. We say BOO to that--especially since these plays are gonna be all kindsa steamy, and our performers very well might be baring more than just their souls. We're anticipating having AT LEAST 20 artists involved. <strong>Anything we make above and beyond our goal will go to the artists.</strong></p>
<h2>What you get in exchange for your money:</h2>
<p>We will perform part or all of <strong>ANY SONG YOU REQUEST</strong> and put it on the Internet!</p>
<p>Let me clarify what I mean by ""perform"": We might <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QpcweBZIAY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sing it</a>. We might <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONTnZ1fpfpM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">perform it as a dramatic monologue</a>. We might <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO-oWoiazG0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">dance to it</a>. We might <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Uvugsd3ws"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">make teddy bears dance to it</a>. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO. <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/singing-for-our-supper-a-fundraiser-for-mariah-maccarthy-s-the-foreplay-play/x/67794?c=activity"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">We did one of these last year</a> for <em>The Foreplay Play, </em>if you're curious as to what kinds of performances we might be doing.</p>
<p>Any donation of any amount gets a ""thank you!"" on Facebook and twitter. Every little bit counts! Seriously, a dollar helps. One dollar.</p>
<p>$5 gets you a haiku.</p>
<p>$10 means Mariah performs your haiku on video.</p>
<p>$15 gets you up to 30 seconds of the song of your choosing.</p>
<p>$25 gets you up to a minute.</p>
<p>$55 gets you the whole song.</p>
<p>$75 gets you the whole song PLUS A COMP TICKET TO THE FESTIVAL!</p>
<p>$100 gets you an ORIGINAL RAP by Mariah, plus TWO comps!</p>

<p>An independently produced Equity Approved Showcase of Paula Vogel's <em>How I Learned To Drive</em> is being presented at Theatre 54 @ Shetler Studios in New York City on October 11th through 13th. This show is being made possible by the determination and creativity of theatre artists from different experiences and disciplines coming together to bring this show to life.</p>
<p>This is not a comissioned revival, and this is not something where everyone involved has hundreds of thousands of dollars to spend. This is something that is being built from the ground up, beginning with almost nothing. People are doing this show because they love theatre and have a passion for storytelling in this format. Getting involved here means you are truly involved in making something special.</p>
<h2><strong>Who Is Involved?</strong></h2>
<p>The director and producer of this production is Jordan Friedman, who previously put up <em>Proof</em> at The Bridge Theatre, and has worked with a variety of New York City theatre companies. For this production he is producing and directing this independently without the financial assistance of another company. In addition, actors, designers and other hard-working production staff will come together, and all of them will benefit greatly from your assistance.</p>
<p>
</p>Cast:<br/>Lil' Bit: *Crawford M. Collins<br/>Uncle Peck: David M. Farrington<br/>Female Greek Chorus: Mary McNulty<br/>Male Greek Chorus: Stephen Powell<br/>Female Greek Chorus: *Hannah Dubner<br/><br/>*Appearing courtesy of Actors Equity Association. <br/><br/>Staff:<br/>Director: Jordan Friedman<br/>Scenic Designer: Young Juang<br/>Lighting Designer: Mitch Ost<br/>Costume Designer: Johanna Pan<br/>Sound Designer: Jake Williams<br/><br/><h2><strong>Why This Show?</strong></h2>
<p><em>How I Learned To Drive</em> is a play with a dynamic and compelling story that takes many unconventional directions and risks with its structure, and such structure presents a complex but worthwhile challenge to stage for an audience. Plays such as this that can balance both hilarious comedy and heartbreaking tragedy give theatregoers an experience that will be remembered. In addition, this is a timeless piece that was enjoyed by audience members 20 years ago, and will be enjoyed 20 years in the future.</p>
<h2>How Can You Help?</h2>
<p>Donating directly to this campaign will be greatly appreciated and will ensure that every person involved in the show can do their jobs to the best of their ability. With the exception of IndieGogo's fees, all of the funds rasied through this campaign will go directly towards the various production costs of putting on independent theatre in New York City, as well as ensuring that every person who works on the production can get the compensation they deserve.</p>
<h2><strong>What Is The Money Being Used For?<br/></strong></h2>
<p>The funds will help to offset the production costs of <em>How I Learned To Drive</em>. This includes:<br/>*Renting the performance venue and rehearsal spaces.</p>
<p>*Providing the designers the budget they need to create the world of the play.</p>
<p>*Compensating everybody involved in the production as much as possible to ensure that all of their hard work gets rewarded.</p>
<p>*Various fees, including securing the rights, union paperwork and marketing the show.</p>
<h2><strong>Last Thoughts:<br/></strong></h2>
<p>This production already does matter to many people, and the intent is for it to matter to many more. Anything you can provide to help this production grow and reach out is valued beyond what words can say.</p>

<p>We have succeeded to the point where we are planning a full season of productions for our 2013-2014 season comprised of three full length stage productions: ""A Christmas Carol"", ""Rehearsal for Murder"", ""Joseph and The Amazing Technicolor Dream Coat"" and a kids theater camp featuring  ""The Jungle Book"" or a similar show. Our challenge is raising the funds needed to pay the royalties and obtain the production rights for these shows well in advance of the production dates themselves. Contributors to this project will help us build the foundation for quality live theater in our area for years to come and support theater education among area youth.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Please help us get to Scotland for the Fringe Fest !  Help build the next Rock of Ages! </p>
<p>This story came to me in a dream, it was as if Janis Joplin wanted this version to be written.  Her STORY TOLD THROUGH her <em>SPIRIT</em> that comes back to earth in 2013.  Sophie B. Hawkins is Joplin's SPIRIT and brings us through different stories and musings about past and present- we let you into an artist's troubled soul, the intelligent woman who staved off bullying, was called  'the Ugliest Man' and became something against all odds throught her spirit.</p>
<p>It is important that 'art' gets made no matter how much the big machine tries to squash and homogonize it.  We have a voice and have survived the threats by a bigger more corporate 'feel good' version of Janis and like David facing Goliath.  We opened in LA to get good reviews and standing ovations in a little 99 seat theater and extended 3 months.  Every actor in this show is here because their heart, passion and belief in Room 105, something that is tryng to tell the truth and unite us all.  Through the understanding of another's pain we get to see/feel/know our own and triumph.  The big guns are still trying to stop the 'grass roots' version by blocking the licensing of songs etc... and if we can get to the Fringe Fest we can have a life in Europe and the World.  It's like when Janis got out of her small town to San Francisco- we are coming to Europe - Janis flousrished leaving Port Arthur and touch peoples lives.  We want to touch you.  We want that chance to grow and are going to the people like Janis did.  We are a show FOR the people, produced by the people.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>All monies raised by you will be used to get airline tickets $14,610.70, housing, food and pay and feed actors and dancers which exceeds $30,000.00 for 30 days!  It is expensive!  Plus we have to license songs, pay insurance as well as legal fees, build the sets and pay musicians to play 27 dates at the Fringe Fest in Scotland, which is like Sundance film festival where all of Europe comes to book shows. If we get good reviews we can go onto the West End and the rest of Europe!!</p>
<p>We are offering different perks for donations in acting, dancing and singing lessons.  If you are able to give a large donation, we will bring you to Scotland to see the show and hang with us post-show one evening!  Be backstage and see rehearsal, and have a lunch with our star Sophie B Hawkins.  We want every contributor whether you donate 1.00 or 100,000 to have their names on a link on our website since this play will be produced <em><strong>by the people!</strong></em></p>
<p>We need to reach our goal- sending 14 people to Scotland for 30 days and that is 100,000.  We have 20,000 so far!   That will cover everyone at a bare minimum.  Scotland is expensive and we have 14 people to house and feed. We don't want to leave any actor behind.  WE ARE FAMILY!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If we make this goal then we will be a musical that is produced BY THE PEOPLE!  It will show what a group of believers can do. Just think a play produced by The People!</p>
<p>The impact on art will be huge and show art does survive and can beat the corporate machine!  Look how Rock of Ages did! ...Even Joplin's friends who knew her came and said we are the best play about her.  We have stories in this play from Janis's lovers and friends that no one has known before...</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute with money we would appreciate your time contribution!  If you live in Scotland you could drive us from airport to where we stay or better yet find a cheap place. Or put us on facebook, raise us money, get the word out, be a street team.....please help us.</p>

It is important that 'art' gets made no matter how much the big machine tries to squash and homogonize it.  We have a voice and have survived the threats by a bigger more corporate 'feel good' version of Janis and like David facing Goliath.  We opened in LA to get good reviews and standing ovations in a little 99 seat theater and extended 3 months.  Every actor in this show is here because their heart, passion and belief in Room 105, something that is tryng to tell the truth and unite us all.  Through the understanding of another's pain we get to see/feel/know our own and triumph.  The big guns are still trying to stop the 'grass roots' version by blocking the licensing of songs etc... and if we can get to the Fringe Fest we can have a life in Europe and the World.  It's like when Janis got out of her small town to San Francisco- we are coming to Europe - Janis flousrished leaving Port Arthur and touch peoples lives.  We want to touch you.  We want that chance to grow and are going to the people like Janis did.  We are a show FOR the people, produced by the people.


What We Need & What You Get
All monies raised by you will be used to get airline tickets $14,610.70, housing, food and pay and feed actors and dancers which exceeds $30,000.00 for 30 days!  It is expensive!  Plus we have to license songs, pay insurance as well as legal fees, build the sets and pay musicians to play 27 dates at the Fringe Fest in Scotland, which is like Sundance film festival where all of Europe comes to book shows. If we get good reviews we can go onto the West End and the rest of Europe!!
We are offering different perks for donations in acting, dancing and singing lessons.  If you are able to give a large donation, we will bring you to Scotland to see the show and hang with us post-show one evening!  Be backstage and see rehearsal, and have a lunch with our star Sophie B Hawkins.  We want every contributor whether you donate 1.00 or 100,000 to have their names on a link on our website since this play will be produced by the people!
We need to reach our goal- sending 14 people to Scotland for 30 days and that is 100,000.  We have 20,000 so far!   That will cover everyone at a bare minimum.  Scotland is expensive and we have 14 people to house and feed. We don't want to leave any actor behind.  WE ARE FAMILY!


The Impact
If we make this goal then we will be a musical that is produced BY THE PEOPLE!  It will show what a group of believers can do. Just think a play produced by The People!
The impact on art will be huge and show art does survive and can beat the corporate machine!  Look how Rock of Ages did! ...Even Joplin's friends who knew her came and said we are the best play about her.  We have stories in this play from Janis's lovers and friends that no one has known before...


Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't contribute with money we would appreciate your time contribution!  If you live in Scotland you could drive us from airport to where we stay or better yet find a cheap place. Or put us on facebook, raise us money, get the word out, be a street team.....please help us.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Hello,
my name is Ross Wade, and on April 27th and 28th of 2012, my musical for young
audiences, SCHEME OF THE SUPER BULLIES, will be presented as part of The New
York Childrenâ€™s Theater Festival at the Marjorie S. Deane Little Theater.
 
I
originally wrote the play for a childrenâ€™s theater class I taught. I began the
class by sitting the students in a circle and asking them, ""If you could
play any kind of character in the world, what would you be?"" Over the next
three months we did theater games, improv scenes, they even wrote and performed
one-act plays starring their characters. 
 
When
rehearsals began, I brought in new pages each week and made revisions based on
their feedback. The class culminated in a workshop production of SCHEME OF THE SUPER BULLIES, a full-length, original musical comedy inspired by their ideas.
 
The
story takes place at Scarlett Pimpernel
Elementary School. If Metropolis
or Gotham City were grade schools,
this is what theyâ€™d be like. So, instead of regular bullies, they have super
bullies and superheroes. Their
names and powers are all based on playground games, like Princess Dodgeball, Countess von Cooties, Eye Spy, Freeze Tag, The Jinx,
and Rock Paper Scissors.

In August, SCHEME OF THE SUPER BULLIES won the 2011 Jackie White Memorial Play Writing Contest, placing first.

The Impact
This is a musical about the importance of working together. I came up with the theme when I noticed some students were struggling to share the stage during improv scenes. I wanted to make the musical's message relevant to both the performers and their audience. And really, working together is what theater's all about. Without a cast and crew, without an audience, there is no theater. Together we create and share an experience we could never accomplish alone. 

It's
 my hope that, by seeing this musical, children will learn just how much
 we can do when we work as a team. Bullying serves only to hurt and 
divide, and the only way to stop it is to stand united against it. In

<p>After nearly 100 years of showing 35mm motion picture film in movie theaters, the film industry is now undergoing a mammoth change to a new format.  Studios and distributors are now making the switch to DCP, or Digital Cinema Package, a file format that is screened at theaters via a high end digital projector and server.  Movie theaters need to invest up to $100,000 per screen to convert to this new systerm.  Up to 60% of U.S. movie theaters have reportedly already made the conversion, with the bulk of those being larger corporate multiplex theaters.  The remaining 40% includes many of the smaller historic neighborhood cinemas across the country that can't afford the high cost of the switch, a good number of which have already been forced to close their doors forever. </p>
<p>The Riverside Drive In Theater is part of this 40% and faces the biggest challenge of its 8 year history. The theater must go digital or go dark. </p>
<p>Since the Drive In opened we have had a growing attendance of ""faithful"" followers.  We have done many events for our local scouts and church groups.  We host a Special Event now twice a year, April Ghouls Monster-Rama and Super Drive In Monster-Rama.  These events bring many folks from all over the world!!</p>
<p>The Riverside Drive In Theater needs to raise $70,000 to make the film-to-digital conversion in 2013. We now launch this Indiegogo campaign to raise the $70,000 as all other options have been exhausted.  The main reason for this is that we are a profit business and there are no programs available to help us that we have qualified for.  If every one of our Facebook fans gave just $25 we'd hit our goal and help keep the Riverside Drive In Theater open.  Please donate to our campaign today - and share and repost with your family and friends too.  Thank you!</p>

We're People's Theatre Project, a grassroots arts organization of artists, activists, educators, and community members of all ages in the Washington Heights neighborhood of northern Manhattan.  For the last 5 years, we have been working together to create and perform original plays about the things in our lives we care about - like immigration, bullying, education access, and children's health.

Hola! We're People's Theatre Project, a grassroots arts organization of artists, activists, educators, and community members of all ages in the Washington Heights neighborhood of northern Manhattan.  For the last 5 years, we have been working together to create and perform original plays about the things in our lives we care about - like immigration, bullying, education access, and children's health. Our vision is to make our NYC neighborhood a model for community building through the arts. Our next step toward realizing this dream is to bring together the community artists from each of our school and community-based groups for one mind blowing evening of original theatre created by kids, teens and adults in our community's very own world-class 3,300 seat venue: The United Palace of Cultural Arts! We're calling it THE PEOPLE STORM THE  PALACE!What We Need & What You Get

<p>Pensacola Shakespeare Theatre, or ""PenShakes"" as we call it sometimes, is a small group of community members looking to bring exceptional theatre to Northwest Florida. We've been together for three years, and we're hoping to continue our work for many years to come.</p>
<p>Here's the thing: Our small theatre needs you. While we usually ask large groups and companies to consider making larger donations; today, we ask you to consider making a humble gift. <strong>We want to help teach and train the next generation of aspiring young artists and we need your help to make it happen. </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Indiegogo Indeed</strong></p>
<p>The apprentices are an integral part of our family, and they often do not get enough credit for their hard work.</p>
<p>Our program gives them the chance to learn from and perform with working actors. They also help teach our summer camps. It’s all valuable professional experience. Their commitment also involves a lot of grunt work, like constructing sets, assisting with advertising, and helping make all other preparations. For all this, they are paid a very small stipend to help cover their expenses. Because our apprentices come from all over the southeast, we provide basic housing. </p>
<p>We're hoping to set our apprentices up for the next level of professional accomplishment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>While this is our first Indiegogo campaign, we’re hoping to make an impact for these young aspiring artists and technicians.</p>
<p>Your donation through this IndieGoGo campaign will make a real difference for these aspiring artists and technicians. Even though the experience they receive is invaluable, many of them couldn’t afford to take part in our program without the cash stipend we provide. Our apprentices today will become the next generation of successful performers, set designers, or theatre professors, and you will help them reach their full potential through your gift today.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes, we believe in something so much, but circumstances prevent us from opening our pockets. We understand, but we also know that you are still a valuable part of helping us build our apprenticeship project. Please tell your friends, family members, colleagues or anyone interested in the arts about our project. Visit our website and our Facebook page to get to know us, and share our sites with the people you know. Getting the word out can be just as helpful as giving. If you are in our area, we also encourage you to come see our performance, make an in-kind donation from your business, or give your time as a volunteer.

<h3>My Story</h3>In May 2010, I graduated from New York University's Tisch School of the Arts with a BFA in Dance.  Since graduation I have been working as a dancer based in New York City.  I have had the honor to work with Brian Brooks Moving Company and Doug Varone and Dancers.  Last Summer I was selected to join DanceNYC's Junior Committee.  The Junior Committee is comprised of 19 of New York City's young leaders in the dance sector, working as artists, educators and administrators.  Our aim is to strengthen and unite the dance community, serve as a catalyst for innovation and invention in the work of young professionals, and re-energize this peer group in a challenging field.<br/><p><br/></p>
<p>I feel the need to bring more attention to the arts, more specifically to dance.  I have applied for a writing workshop at Dance Theater Workshop, Writing on Dance with Eva Yaa 
Asantewaa.  Eva has been writing on dance since 1976, she has been published in Dance 
Magazine, The Village Voice, SoHo Weekly News, and Gay City News.  This workshop meets once a week from March 30-June 1 and is focused on exercises that consider 
questions such as: How do I relate and respond to dance?  Why write 
about dance? What is my role? and Who am I as perceiver and witness of 
art?  <br/></p>
</div><div>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I will use this class to explore the relationship between performance and written response; specifically how can they compliment, challenge, and strengthen each other?  After the completion of this workshop, I will share my responses to dance in an effort to build advocacy for the field and strengthen the artistic discourse.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I have been discouraged recently by the tone in 
which critics at the New York Times have been writing on dance, I feel 
it does not serve the field to ruthlessly attack the artists in these 
'opinion' articles.  On the other hand, after attending a discussion 
with Jennifer Homan in early March, I felt inspired by the insight and attention 
Jennifer has brought to dance through her book 'Apollos Angels'.  We need more critical discussion 
of dance that doesn't discourage artists, from challenging the field, and
 the public, from attending and supporting artistic endeavours.<br/></p>

<p>is a new street-theater musical comedy by the award-winning guerrilla-theater company the Imagination Liberation Front. <em>Mr. Satan</em> will perform this summer, outdoors in the parks of New York City – including for the Occupy Wall Street troops in Zuccotti Park – and in the streets outside of the Republican and Democratic national conventions.</p>
<p>IN <em>MR. SATAN</em>, Satan is laid off from Hell because humanity has become too adept at doing evil. To get his job back, Satan makes a deal with neoliberal economist Larry Summers to break up Occupy Wall Street. But the love between two young OWS activists might shake the Devil’s allegiance. What would Satan do? Our answer: He’d sing!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>WHO ARE WE?</h2>
<p>CO-AUTHORS HIERONYMOUS BANG and Sam Precario are members of the Imagination Liberation Front. BANG wrote and directed the guerrilla comedy smash <em>“I’m Gonna Kill the President!” A Federal Offense</em>, which played at theaters, parks, parking lots, basements, and alleys around the country for five years during Bush II. </p>
<p>THE IMAGINATION LIBERATION FRONT is a guerrilla theater company in the public service. We created <em>Mr. Satan</em> to raise consciousness, to challenge OWS to articulate an alternative vision with mass appeal, and to turn the re-occupation of Zuccotti Park into five-star theater.We oppose violence and boredom. We wield theater as a powerful tool for social change. We mass-produce that tool through cathartic indoctrination. We also conduct guerrilla theater workshops for disadvantaged youth and other interested parties wherever we go.</p>
<p>BY SENDING our seven guerrilla artists on this tour, you are taking the power of creativity to the front lines of the economic justice movement. You are helping us to seize this historical moment, to use theater to tell the truth, and to demonstrate the power of imagination to solve real-world problems. Media coverage of this play – and there will be media coverage – will display the intelligence, humor, compassion, discipline and ferocity of this movement. Activists and regular citizens around the country will hear of this work and find inspiration.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>BRASS TACKS, PLEASE</h2>
<p>WE ARE RAISING $5,000 with this Indiegogo campaign to support our tour to the conventions, which take place in late August and early September. Our overall fundraising goal for this project is $12,000, which we are supplementing by holding big- and small-ticket benefit readings.</p>
<p>OUR MAIN EXPENSE IS THE TOUR. Airfare (NYC &gt; Tampa Bay &gt; Charlotte &gt; NYC) for seven will cost $650 per person, totaling $4,550. Our next main cost is feeding our company. Each of us will receive a $20 per diem for meals. The tour will last for 13 days, from the day we leave for Tampa to the day we return from Charlotte. That adds up to $1,820. This campaign will cover airfare and some of our meal budget; the rest of our budget includes stipends for our amazing actors, director, music director and stage manager; costumes, props and other production essentials; and smaller tour expenses like bus fare.</p>
<p>HENCE, a contribution of $20 feeds one actor for a day. A contribution of $140 feeds the whole troupe for a day. A donation of $650 pays for one actor’s plane ticket, while a contribution of $910 covers one actor’s entire trip. If we fall short of our goal, we will tighten our belts accordingly. If we only make it to one convention instead of both, our voices will still be heard. If we fall extremely short of our goal, what we raise will support the New York production and a possible Los Angeles production. Finally, you may notice that accommodations are not in this budget—we are cutting costs by couch surfing with friends and strangers. Feel free to get in touch if you know of a friendly couch!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>REWARDS!</h2>
<p>SURE, IMAGINATION LIBERATION FRONT, this project is a great tactic in the struggle for economic equality, freedom of speech and social justice, but what’s in it for <em>me? </em>We also offer neat rewards for contributions! Postcards from the actors while on tour; the original cast soundtrack; songs written in your honor by the composer, plays written based on your life by the playwright; and more! Your memento will testify that you supported direct, creative action at the orgies of oligarchy in New York, Tampa Bay and Charlotte—without leaving the comfort of your computer bunker!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>IMPACT</h2>
<p>THIS IS A CRUCIAL TIME to act against corporate rule. Greedmongers call the shots. Our leaders are compromised or downright bad. People are struggling. Our voices are squeezed out of mainstream media. The good news is, upon quick review of human history, profound social change always starts from the grassroots level—possibly from the same parks and streets where <em>Mr. Satan</em> will perform. The movement is already happening. Your support brings us that much closer to success.</p>
<p>WE MODEL CHANGE that is creative and fun, and there’s nothing more fun than laughing, crying, singing and dancing—while occupying public space. Although this play will be performed outdoors, during demonstrations and other events, it will be executed with artistic precision and panache. A well-crafted, quality work of theater sends the message that our movement is not one of slovenly slackers but of focused, committed visionaries.</p>

<p>THE ILF’S first show, <em>“I’m Gonna Kill the President!” A Federal Offense</em>, achieved national notoriety and ran for five years all around the U.S. It performed in ten states, in well known venues like PS122 in New York and Highways in L.A., as well as in parks, parking lots, basements, warehouses, alleys, community centers and living rooms. <em>President! </em>wormed its way into mainstream media like Fox News, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, the <em>New York Times</em>, the <em>New York Post</em>, and countless more. The show received an L.A. Weekly Award for Special Achievement in 2006 and went to the Spoleto Festival in South Carolina in 2007.</p>
<p>MUCH OF THE RUN OF <em>PRESIDENT!</em> was conducted guerrilla-style, out of a van, adapting to a variety of environments. That experience will come in handy on our tour. We have designed <em>Mr. Satan</em> to be light and easy—minimal props and costumes, no set pieces or technical gear. As producers of guerrilla theater work as well as “regular” theater, we know how to come in on budget. We have extensive connections throughout Occupy, as well as in activist, media, social and theatrical networks, and have support in every city we will visit.</p>

<h3>THANK YOU for your support! All hail <em>Mr. Satan!</em>
</h3></div>","MR. SATAN GOES TO WALL STREET
is a new street-theater musical comedy by the award-winning guerrilla-theater company the Imagination Liberation Front. Mr. Satan will perform this summer, outdoors in the parks of New York City – including for the Occupy Wall Street troops in Zuccotti Park – and in the streets outside of the Republican and Democratic national conventions.
IN MR. SATAN, Satan is laid off from Hell because humanity has become too adept at doing evil. To get his job back, Satan makes a deal with neoliberal economist Larry Summers to break up Occupy Wall Street. But the love between two young OWS activists might shake the Devil’s allegiance. What would Satan do? Our answer: He’d sing!
 
WHO ARE WE?
CO-AUTHORS HIERONYMOUS BANG and Sam Precario are members of the Imagination Liberation Front. BANG wrote and directed the guerrilla comedy smash “I’m Gonna Kill the President!” A Federal Offense, which played at theaters, parks, parking lots, basements, and alleys around the country for five years during Bush II. 
THE IMAGINATION LIBERATION FRONT is a guerrilla theater company in the public service. We created Mr. Satan to raise consciousness, to challenge OWS to articulate an alternative vision with mass appeal, and to turn the re-occupation of Zuccotti Park into five-star theater.We oppose violence and boredom. We wield theater as a powerful tool for social change. We mass-produce that tool through cathartic indoctrination. We also conduct guerrilla theater workshops for disadvantaged youth and other interested parties wherever we go.
BY SENDING our seven guerrilla artists on this tour, you are taking the power of creativity to the front lines of the economic justice movement. You are helping us to seize this historical moment, to use theater to tell the truth, and to demonstrate the power of imagination to solve real-world problems. Media coverage of this play – and there will be media coverage – will display the intelligence, humor, compassion, discipline and ferocity of this movement. Activists and regular citizens around the country will hear of this work and find inspiration.
 
BRASS TACKS, PLEASE
WE ARE RAISING $5,000 with this Indiegogo campaign to support our tour to the conventions, which take place in late August and early September. Our overall fundraising goal for this project is $12,000, which we are supplementing by holding big- and small-ticket benefit readings.
OUR MAIN EXPENSE IS THE TOUR. Airfare (NYC > Tampa Bay > Charlotte > NYC) for seven will cost $650 per person, totaling $4,550. Our next main cost is feeding our company. Each of us will receive a $20 per diem for meals. The tour will last for 13 days, from the day we leave for Tampa to the day we return from Charlotte. That adds up to $1,820. This campaign will cover airfare and some of our meal budget; the rest of our budget includes stipends for our amazing actors, director, music director and stage manager; costumes, props and other production essentials; and smaller tour expenses like bus fare.
HENCE, a contribution of $20 feeds one actor for a day. A contribution of $140 feeds the whole troupe for a day. A donation of $650 pays for one actor’s plane ticket, while a contribution of $910 covers one actor’s entire trip. If we fall short of our goal, we will tighten our belts accordingly. If we only make it to one convention instead of both, our voices will still be heard. If we fall extremely short of our goal, what we raise will support the New York production and a possible Los Angeles production. Finally, you may notice that accommodations are not in this budget—we are cutting costs by couch surfing with friends and strangers. Feel free to get in touch if you know of a friendly couch!
 
REWARDS!
SURE, IMAGINATION LIBERATION FRONT, this project is a great tactic in the struggle for economic equality, freedom of speech and social justice, but what’s in it for me? We also offer neat rewards for contributions! Postcards from the actors while on tour; the original cast soundtrack; songs written in your honor by the composer, plays written based on your life by the playwright; and more! Your memento will testify that you supported direct, creative action at the orgies of oligarchy in New York, Tampa Bay and Charlotte—without leaving the comfort of your computer bunker!
 
IMPACT
THIS IS A CRUCIAL TIME to act against corporate rule. Greedmongers call the shots. Our leaders are compromised or downright bad. People are struggling. Our voices are squeezed out of mainstream media. The good news is, upon quick review of human history, profound social change always starts from the grassroots level—possibly from the same parks and streets where Mr. Satan will perform. The movement is already happening. Your support brings us that much closer to success.
WE MODEL CHANGE that is creative and fun, and there’s nothing more fun than laughing, crying, singing and dancing—while occupying public space. Although this play will be performed outdoors, during demonstrations and other events, it will be executed with artistic precision and panache. A well-crafted, quality work of theater sends the message that our movement is not one of slovenly slackers but of focused, committed visionaries.

Elixir Productions Theatre Company was founded

and because all serious theatre companies have names, we decided to call ourselves “Elixir Productions” after the kind of theatre we wanted to make: magical, restorative, weird and beautiful.

In the 10-plus years since our college days, Elixir has thrived as an independent theatre company dedicated to producing original work by our Resident
Playwright (Alex DeFazio, M.F.A. Columbia University, finalist for the
Princess Grace Playwriting Award), under the direction of our Resident Director
(Jody P. Person, M.F.A. Rutgers University/Mason Gross School of the Arts), and
featuring an extremely talented and dedicated company of actors.

Made from equal parts tradition and experimentation, our company continues
to dig for magic. At the same time, we have also grown to take on the larger mission
of creating uniquely queer performances that explore subversive forms
of desire.

The World-Premiere Play
Part gay noir and part meditation on memory and loss, our upcoming production, 2 Burn, centers on the relationship between Paul, a professor of English and theory, and Manny, an ambitious but struggling college student. Fresh from a bad breakup and stymied by writer’s block, Paul turns to Manny for validation and companionship, becoming his lover as well as his tutor. Manny devours Paul’s teachings, intent on mastering the power of words. But Manny has a secret, and its discovery ultimately leads both men to battle for control over language, sex, and each other.

Elixir Productions is a frugal
little company; we keep costs low so that we can focus first on making great

<h3>Who the Hell Do You Think You Are?<br/>
</h3>
<p>Hello friends and lovers.  Thanks for visiting my solo show touring campaign.  If you are here, you most likely know me or my work, but just to catch us all up to speed:  <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>My name is <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Desiree Burch</span>.  For the past ten years, I have been a performance artist, educator and vibrant part of the Downtown theater community of New York.  I am a graduate of Yale University, and since 2001, have created personal, funny, compelling and daring work for theaters, comedy clubs, museums, schools and out of doors around NYC, the USA and more recently, the UK.  <br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Isaac Byrne</span> is my director, collaborator and friend.  He is the former Artistic Director of the NYIT and GLAAD Award-winning theater company, Working Man's Clothes, as well as a teacher of acting technique at the New York Film Academy. We began working together 4 years ago, in the early stages of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">52 Man Pickup</span>, helping to transform it from raw and raunchy stories pulled out of a hat into a deeply transformational experience for both artist and audience, with all of its dirty diamonds still gleaming.</p>

</div></div>","Who the Hell Do You Think You Are?

Hello friends and lovers.  Thanks for visiting my solo show touring campaign.  If you are here, you most likely know me or my work, but just to catch us all up to speed:  

My name is Desiree Burch.  For the past ten years, I have been a performance artist, educator and vibrant part of the Downtown theater community of New York.  I am a graduate of Yale University, and since 2001, have created personal, funny, compelling and daring work for theaters, comedy clubs, museums, schools and out of doors around NYC, the USA and more recently, the UK.  
Isaac Byrne is my director, collaborator and friend.  He is the former Artistic Director of the NYIT and GLAAD Award-winning theater company, Working Man's Clothes, as well as a teacher of acting technique at the New York Film Academy. We began working together 4 years ago, in the early stages of 52 Man Pickup, helping to transform it from raw and raunchy stories pulled out of a hat into a deeply transformational experience for both artist and audience, with all of its dirty diamonds still gleaming.
52 Man Pickup is a show we have made together.  It is a sex-positive theater and comedy piece that comes from authentic and personal experiences, bridging sexuality, race, identity, religion, feminism

What the Hell Are You Doing?Since collaborating on theatrical performances at The Tank and Ars Nova, we have played venerable venues like The Ohio Theatre, Joe's Pub and 59E59, and have taken the work to Hollywood, New Orleans, England and Scotland.  We have also created a new work, Tar Baby--the premiere of which many of you witnessed in the soloNOVA Festival this May.  This August we will be taking the show to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, the original fringe, and the largest open arts festival in the world.  This will be a return to the Fringe for 52 Man Pickup, having been part of the Free Festival in 2009.  This time around though, we are going not just for the experience, but to take advantage of the opportunities there.  Like NYC, Edinburgh is an over-saturated market, but also a place where quality work can rise to the top in grand fashion--gaining opportunities for booking and representation.  It's essentially an arts conference, and this year we are going with the Festival's hottest new theatrical hub:  The Hill Street Theatre.  We are also securing PR assistance in fighting the uphill battle of getting behinds in seats, so that the magic can all happen.We have a tried and tested product, and the presentation and production required to really make the most out if the experience. I wouldn't be going back if I didn't think that it was worth all the money and effort put into it to really be seen.  Who the Hell Cares?

Well, here's the benefit to me--
This production does have the ability to change my life as a solo performer.  It can set the stage for my work in the international arena, and provide more opportunities for 52 Man Pickup, and Tar Baby, as well as future shows that I create.  It also opens me up to the world of agents and producers for television as well as theater. It assures that my voice gets out there in the way that not only I, but many of you, think it should.

And here's the benefit to everyone else--
The main reason I continue to do this show, after almost 5 years of performing it, is that, each time I do, someone, male or female, comes up to me after the show to tell me their very personal story.  They talk about how this show speaks to their experience, and how they'd felt like the were alone until they heard me tell my story.  I can see how powerful that validation and recognition is to them--it's as important as theirs is to me.  And this is, in fact, what theater is for.  This show has the opportunity to reach people in different corners of the universe, to educate as well as entertain, and to instill a stronger sense of empathy, self confidence and self worth in all who experience it.  I really believe that.  I have seen it happen.  And I really do like to think that people who have experienced this worth with me are better (to themselves and others) for it.

And aside from the personal impact the show may have, it definitely has an impact in making theater more relevant, accessible and important to people than it sometimes feels.  Whether you've seen a lot or a little of it, this show always makes for memorable theater, as it is a memorable experience.

What the Hell Do You Want, and What the Hell Do I Get Out of This?

We are setting our fundraising goals high but attainable.  We are seeking to raise 10,000 by July 22, 2011.

That sounds crazy, you say?  Well, if everyone who in this intimate circle of friends and supporters were to give $10 or $20, we would have more than enough.  I know, crazy right?  

The beautiful thing is that, in the course of the past 10, or really, 14 years that I have lived on the East Coast and been a dedicated performer, I have met thousands of like minded artists, activists, dreamers, thinkers, and moreover, just good people.  Like yourself.  And I know that many of you believe in what I have to say to the world and getting it out there.  All I am asking of you is to put a little bit of money - a cocktail or two's worth of money - where your mouth is.  And some of you can afford to, and would like to do a lot more, and I would love to give you that opportunity ;-)

<h3><span> </span></h3>
</div>
<div>Hello I am <span class=""il"">Mysterion</span>, longtime Canadian variety entertainer and burlesque producer. I am the founder of the Canadian burlesque hall of Fame as well as the producer of the longest running community burlesque stage. My mind reading show has been a local draw for almost a decade and what I make, I put back into the scene by raising the bar and making the events bigger and better. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>My goal for the past decade was to create an environment that allows performers to have a stage to work on, learn and benefit from the network  have built and thus get bigger themselves faster. After building and creating so many local performers and working with so many newcomers, I've been asked to be a guest and judge in the first annual Japanese burlesque talent show. Strip Search Tokyo.   </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Burlesque is an art form and rarely does a show make a huge profit, alot of the performers do it for the thrill of the act. Seeing this is a first time event, I have to get myself over there. This will give me an opportunity to experience burlesque from another culture, LIVE and bring that back to Canada. It will also provide a young scene in Japan a veteran teacher and experienced judge who can bring them knowledge and insight to their community. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The shows Ive done in Toronto have been for the benefit of the young performers to get seen and get on bigger shows. Having me in Japan only brings credibility to the Toronto shows, while allowing our Japanese counterparts the opportunity to have a Canadian perspective at their event. </div>
</div>
<div>
<div class=""im"">
<h3>What We Need<span style=""font-size: 10px;""> </span>
</h3>
</div>
<div>I will need $3000 Canadian dollars to make this trip happen. This will cover my airfare, lodging, food and ground transportation. I work on a tight budget and plan to donate my time to the show on a drastically reduced rate, practically free. All flood money will go directly back into Strip search Tokyo to cover the costs of their needs if applicable.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The funds always will go towards the goal, I will additionally be producing a LIVE fundraier for proceeds as well as this indigogo. </div>
<div> </div>
</div>
<div>
<div class=""im"">
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div>
<div>My track record in the industry is one of the most successful while working on a grassroots budget. I have grown to producing the largest burlesque shows in the country, all from my pocket and all very successful. I have organized fundraisers for the Toronto Burlesque Festival, Co produce the TBF as well as founded the Great Canadian Burlesque Academy: A dance school for young and veterans alike to build and learn. From my own hard work I have networked to performers around the globe and brought them to Canada for the purpose to build our scene and allows others to learn from them and be inspired. My starting of the Canadian Hall of Fame was to recognize the contributions of the performers who have come before us while nourishing the present and building a future. </div>

<li>
<strong>WHERE</strong>: Theatre of NOTE – 1517 N. Cahuenga Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90028</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Thank you for considering being a co-producer for our show!</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3>
<span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">About the Show </span><strong style=""font-size: 1.17em;""><strong><br/></strong></strong>
</h3>
<p>""The story is about Annabelle and Lucy who are two personalities, of perhaps many personalities, that are inhabiting one body. In the beginning of the play, they're really not able to connect at all. However, by the end, how each of them deal with the abuse is what inevitably allows them to come together in the end.""</p>
<p><span> T</span>here is something very haunting about both Sylvia and Marilyn who, each in their own way, hid behind a public mask, and only through their writings were they able to release some of their darkest demons. </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Did these demons inevitably lead to their suicides?</em></li>
<li><em>Does death of choice lead to a different place than death of natural cause?</em></li>
<li><em>What, then, is this “middle distance” when, perhaps, your heart and soul separate from your body? And then how do they get back to it.</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>The Process</h3>
<p>The one thing that's remained constant in all of the drafts is that there was this sexual abuse. A lot of that comes from Marilyn Monroe's writings. Her Aunt Ida being the one who abused her when she was a child.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Victims of this sexual abuse who are stuck in these situations, most of the time are either in denial of the abuse, or they don't know how to get out of it, or they're too afraid to try.</em></li>
<li><em>Predators come in all different shapes and sizes, and it could be the person you least expect it to be.</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>Thoughts on Marilyn Monroe and Sylvia Plath:</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Marilyn, when you look at her writing, she was really very unhappy and very disturbed.</em></li>
<li><em>With Sylvia Plath, I've always been drawn to ""What does it mean to be mentally unstable?""</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>Writing My Own Piece</h3>
<p>What I love about writing my own piece is that literally anything is possible. I have the freedom to create whatever I want to create.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>We really wanted to do this play, inspired by these writings, for the Hollywood Fringe Festival this year! And we can't wait to share it with all of you!</em></li>
</ul>

Thank you for considering being a co-producer for our show!
 

About the Show 

""The story is about Annabelle and Lucy who are two personalities, of perhaps many personalities, that are inhabiting one body. In the beginning of the play, they're really not able to connect at all. However, by the end, how each of them deal with the abuse is what inevitably allows them to come together in the end.""
 There is something very haunting about both Sylvia and Marilyn who, each in their own way, hid behind a public mask, and only through their writings were they able to release some of their darkest demons. 

Did these demons inevitably lead to their suicides?
Does death of choice lead to a different place than death of natural cause?
What, then, is this “middle distance” when, perhaps, your heart and soul separate from your body? And then how do they get back to it.

The Process
The one thing that's remained constant in all of the drafts is that there was this sexual abuse. A lot of that comes from Marilyn Monroe's writings. Her Aunt Ida being the one who abused her when she was a child.

Victims of this sexual abuse who are stuck in these situations, most of the time are either in denial of the abuse, or they don't know how to get out of it, or they're too afraid to try.
Predators come in all different shapes and sizes, and it could be the person you least expect it to be.

Thoughts on Marilyn Monroe and Sylvia Plath:

Marilyn, when you look at her writing, she was really very unhappy and very disturbed.
With Sylvia Plath, I've always been drawn to ""What does it mean to be mentally unstable?""

Writing My Own Piece
What I love about writing my own piece is that literally anything is possible. I have the freedom to create whatever I want to create.

We really wanted to do this play, inspired by these writings, for the Hollywood Fringe Festival this year! And we can't wait to share it with all of you!

<h3>What is Dahmer?</h3>
<div id=""description"">
<p>This piece is a physical exploration of the 1990’s infamous life of Jeffrey Dahmer. Homosexual, cannibal, serial killer, and alcoholic are just a few of the adjectives immediately attached with Jeffrey’s memory. As an ensemble we have extensively researched his life based off of biography’s and interviews available to us. Using this research, we have individually drawn parallels in our own lives and used that to create this very human journey through 7 poignant moments in Dahmers life. With original pre-recorded composition, and a purpose of approaching this mans life at an un-biased point of view, we have developed a strong, risky piece of physical theater that allows the audience to draw parallels to their own lives and possibly understand what point of view Jeffery lived his own life from, without disregarding his obvious wrong-doings and keeping the respect for his victims in mind. We are simply taking a media monster and returning him to his human form.</p>
</div>

<h3>Where will the money be going?</h3>
<p>Most of the funds we raise will be used toward travel expenses! I have been accepted for the Hollywood Fringe festival and intend on participating in other festivals overseas. However, other expenses include...</p>

As our community of artists grows, we will reach more of you with our work.</li>
<li>We believe in you. We believe that theater brings something unique to each audience member and each participant. Very few things allow us such a communal and at the same moment deeply personal experience. With the help of crowdfunding, good old fashion fundraising, and our tenacity we believe we can fund NITC and share our dreams with you.</li>

Risks & Challenges
Raising funds for art and artists these days seems to be getting harder and harder. That's why we are crowdfunding and coming directly to you! What is society without culture and the arts? What is the voice of the people without the inspiration and questioning that happens when we come face to face with art and artists? We are searching for people who are as committed as we are to fund NITC. We would love to have you as part of our NITC village. And we want to know your story, your relationship to theater. Share it in the comment section or send us an email. But tell us! We can't do this without you. Here's what we are striving to continue to do:

At NITC we are tenacious. We believe passionately in what we are doing. We are cultivating audiences that want to experience our diverse voice. We are finding actors, musicians, writers and artists across the genres who want to be a part of NITC. As our community of artists grows, we will reach more of you with our work.
We believe in you. We believe that theater brings something unique to each audience member and each participant. Very few things allow us such a communal and at the same moment deeply personal experience. With the help of crowdfunding, good old fashion fundraising, and our tenacity we believe we can fund NITC and share our dreams with you.

At NITC we can always use help in other ways. There are so many things you can do to get on board with us:

<p>At the center of <i>No Candy</i> is a multi-generational community of Bosnian Muslim women who survived the Srebrenica genocide and, years later, open a gift shop for tourists who visit the Srebrenica memorial. While No Candy is very much about how trauma inhabits the body and shapes a community, it is also about the persistence of humor, art, and absurdity in an unimaginable time.</p>
<p><b>What made me want to write No Candy is </b>that I’ve been thinking about the communities comprised solely of women, and why they are formed, how they function, and what is the presence of men, if any, if it isn’t physical. And in August 2014, when the Yazidi community came under persecution by ISIS and the women forced into sexual slavery, I began to think about the female community again, but in the context of ethnic and gendered persecution. I was reminded of the Bosnian Muslims during the Bosnian War, specifically during the Srebrenica genocide. And it was through this landscape of Bosnia that gave me access to explore this particular kind of trauma and how a community of women sustains and rebuilds itself years later after the war. While trauma functions as a baseline within the play, what I am more interested in exploring in the lives of these women is how a community rebuilds itself through humor and absurdity. In my conversations with Bosnian artist Sejla Kameric, who was a teenager during the Bosnian war, she very much insists on the duality of lightness living alongside atrocity and trauma. That during the war, there were sunny days, babies being born, theater being produced, and somewhere, some teenager was listening to Nirvana in their headphones and ignoring their parents. There’s a kind of absurdity in that duality, of living during war, and I believe in it. I believe it is at the center of these women in the play and at the core of their recovery.</p>
<div>
<p>We are so excited about this collaboration! <b>What is unique about the collaboration behind <i>NO CANDY</i> is </b>the creative exchange between Chicago and New York. Before I left for Columbia University’s MFA program, I was working regularly with a community of actors, designers, and directors. However, since being in New York, I’ve met some really stellar group of designers and producers. And so, I’d like to take the opportunity of my thesis to nurture my relationships in both cities and create a partnership between the two groups of collaborators! It is the hope that with this kind of collaboration, the play will have the opportunity to be seen and produced in both.</p>

<h3>Démarche artistique</h3>
<p>La force d'Aurée Danse-Création réside en sa capacité de jeter un regard contemporain sur les rythmes traditionnels haïtiens afin de faire ressortir l’universalité de leurs messages.  Au fil de nos multiples expériences professionnelles dans le monde de la danse, nous avons pu constater que malgré les différentes formes de danse,  le fond et le but ultime de cet art sont la recherche d'émerveillement et la soif de redécouvrir la beauté.  Forte de ce constat, Aurée Danse-Création est allée à la rencontre de danseuses interprètes qui sont d’origines haïtienne, québécoise, brésilienne et mexicaine, pour créer Sezam.  À travers leurs forces techniques et leur grand potentiel d’interprétation, le public pourra vivre des émotions qui émanent d’un concept universel. Ce travail se fera en référence aux pas traditionnels haïtiens et à notre style de création qui marie rigueur technique et texture émotionnelle.</p>

They wanted to create theatre inspired by every day experiences, that questioned the society we live in and the social norms and traditions that box us in. They hope to inspire discussion, education and action through their performances.

Three years later and CLT has crossed the pond and several boundaries to create work that does all of the above. 


After an incredible first run at Camden People's Theatre's Calm Down, Dear feminist theatre festival in London, CLT's newest play 'CREAM PIE' is about to embark on a run at Brighton Fringe Festival.

The show moves between Morton’s office, the sitting room where the Princess recorded her darkest secrets onto cassettes, and the dingy West London cafe where one of her best friends surreptitiously handed them over. The subterfuge and deception are brought to a scorching climax that changed celebrity, privacy, and the Windsor family forever. The question remains: who was the victim, and who the victor?<p></p> <div>The production will premiere at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in August 2016. The writer, James Clements, is a theatre artist who lives between New York and Glasgow, and this production will marry the strong creative and artistic heritage of both locations to create a diverse team and an original piece that is socially relevant, powerful, and unapologetic. This play will give voice to a woman that was spoken for her whole life, and aim to explore the trauma's that marred her bright, but brief, existence.</div><div>The show will play at theSpace UK at Niddry Street August 22nd through the 27th.</div>

We believe it is a story that must be told, and that the Princess's true story deserves to be heard. The money we raise will go toward - </p> <ul> <li>Renting the venue (the Space @ Niddry Street) for the show's run</li>
<li>Transporting cast, crew and materials from New York to Scotland</li>
<li>Props, costumes, publicity materials and set needs in Edinburgh</li>
<li>Accommodation for theatre artists during the run of the show</li>
<li>Registration costs for the Fringe Festival</li>
</ul>
<div>As an expression of our gratitude for helping us tell this vital story, we will offer a range of perks including signed posters, signed scripts and free tickets to performances. We have been developing this piece for a long time, and truly believe it is a socio-historical necessity that it is told. We can't imagine a better venue to premiere it than this wonderful theatre festival, and any funding we do raise, even if not the full amount, will allow us to move closer to this becoming a reality.</div>

James Clements.........................................................Writer/Producer/ActorJorge Morales.............................................................Producer/ActorSam Hood Adrain.......................................................Producer/ActorAna-Cristina Schuler..................................................ActressAdam Welsh................................................................Sound/Video DesignMairi MacInnes............................................................Costume/Set DesignThis tense thriller presents the true story of one of the greatest media scandals in British history – the publication of Andrew Morton's book about Diana, Princess of Wales, which ended her marriage and shook the monarchy to its core. The show moves between Morton’s office, the sitting room where the Princess recorded her darkest secrets onto cassettes, and the dingy West London cafe where one of her best friends surreptitiously handed them over. The subterfuge and deception are brought to a scorching climax that changed celebrity, privacy, and the Windsor family forever. The question remains: who was the victim, and who the victor? The production will premiere at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in August 2016. The writer, James Clements, is a theatre artist who lives between New York and Glasgow, and this production will marry the strong creative and artistic heritage of both locations to create a diverse team and an original piece that is socially relevant, powerful, and unapologetic. This play will give voice to a woman that was spoken for her whole life, and aim to explore the trauma's that marred her bright, but brief, existence.The show will play at theSpace UK at Niddry Street August 22nd through the 27th.
 Your funding is so appreciated and so necessary to the creation of this piece. We believe it is a story that must be told, and that the Princess's true story deserves to be heard. The money we raise will go toward -   Renting the venue (the Space @ Niddry Street) for the show's run
Transporting cast, crew and materials from New York to Scotland
Props, costumes, publicity materials and set needs in Edinburgh
Accommodation for theatre artists during the run of the show
Registration costs for the Fringe Festival

As an expression of our gratitude for helping us tell this vital story, we will offer a range of perks including signed posters, signed scripts and free tickets to performances. We have been developing this piece for a long time, and truly believe it is a socio-historical necessity that it is told. We can't imagine a better venue to premiere it than this wonderful theatre festival, and any funding we do raise, even if not the full amount, will allow us to move closer to this becoming a reality.


 We hope this play will -   Allow us to tell the story of a woman who we all invaded and utilised to understand ourselves and our society from her perspective.
Allow us to consider the role of the media in our cultural institutions and governing bodies, and the impact it has on our perceptions, then and now. Begin dialogues around agency and ownership of personal histories and stories - who writes them, who consumes them, and who they impact.

Take responsibility for humanizing an iconic person, and giving language to a individual so often identified simply by images.
    
 While we hope to sell enough tickets to cover some of our costs, the Edinburgh Fringe is a highly competitive and busy environment. As emerging artists, trying to establish our voices, we truly need the funding for this project to proceed, and to get this important story heard. Without funding, this project will struggle to be realised, but with even some funds raised, our talented and committed team will put together a performance that does the story, and its protagonist, justice.
Some challenges include - 


Transporting our team and our sets from New York to Scotland.
Finding ways to accommodate international artists during the Festival.

Using technology to allow the piece to develop across continents successfully.

Combining two different networks of artists from different continents, and encouraging cross-cultural dialogue.


 If you find yourselves unable to contribute financially at this time, we would still deeply appreciate your help in any way that you can.  Please share our campaign with everyone that you think might be interested or supportive of our work. Please come and see our show - we desperately want it to be seen, and that contribution is, in itself, so powerful.

So much so, that for the past 9 years I've put together countless film screenings at The Palace Theater here in Syracuse, NY. From westerns, cult classics, or horror marathons, we’ve kept the 35mm torch burning.</p><p>As digital becomes the dominant format in cinemas, the depth and beauty of 35mm film is on the verge of extinction. But digital can’t compare to a restored film print or the nostalgic grit of a grindhouse print. From being touched by artists or directors, to being screened in some of the most amazing film houses in the world, each print holds its own history. Some films have not yet made the transfer from film to digital, and might never be, leaving future film fans unable to experience it on the silver screen. 

</p><p>Recently, the analog processor for our 35mm projector broke. I'm raising funds to get a new processor, pay for a certified Dolby Audio Technician to adjust/equalize the audio after the repairs and to help cover shipping expenses. With your contribution, you'll be able to help save 35mm film screenings in Syracuse with improved sound quality and updated film audio technology. </p><p>Without these repairs, the Palace Theater will do away with the film projector entirely and go strictly to a digital format. 35mm will survive as long as fans like you and I keep it alive. LONG LIVE 35mm!</p><p> </p> <p></p> <p> </p><h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get:</h3> <p>This is what I need:</p><ul>
<li>Updated sound processor</li>
<li>Dolby Certified Audio Technician to EQ system</li>
<li>Repairs to the Subwoofer </li>
<li>Tech to re-wire the audio rack</li>
</ul><p>$1400 will cover all that needs to get done to improve the system.  The most expensive being the Dolby Sound Tech. Any funds raised over the goal will go towards expenses for the 2015 Salt City Horror Fest.</p><p>This is what you get:</p><ul>
<li>A better viewing and listening experience</li>

<br/><p></p><ul></ul><p></p> <p> </p><h3><br/></h3></div>","Who am I ? Hello Film Fans.  I'm Jeff Meyer and watching movies on celluloid is a true love of mine. So much so, that for the past 9 years I've put together countless film screenings at The Palace Theater here in Syracuse, NY. From westerns, cult classics, or horror marathons, we’ve kept the 35mm torch burning.As digital becomes the dominant format in cinemas, the depth and beauty of 35mm film is on the verge of extinction. But digital can’t compare to a restored film print or the nostalgic grit of a grindhouse print. From being touched by artists or directors, to being screened in some of the most amazing film houses in the world, each print holds its own history. Some films have not yet made the transfer from film to digital, and might never be, leaving future film fans unable to experience it on the silver screen. 

Recently, the analog processor for our 35mm projector broke. I'm raising funds to get a new processor, pay for a certified Dolby Audio Technician to adjust/equalize the audio after the repairs and to help cover shipping expenses. With your contribution, you'll be able to help save 35mm film screenings in Syracuse with improved sound quality and updated film audio technology. Without these repairs, the Palace Theater will do away with the film projector entirely and go strictly to a digital format. 35mm will survive as long as fans like you and I keep it alive. LONG LIVE 35mm!    What I Need & What You Get: This is what I need:
Updated sound processor
Dolby Certified Audio Technician to EQ system
Repairs to the Subwoofer 
Tech to re-wire the audio rack
$1400 will cover all that needs to get done to improve the system.  The most expensive being the Dolby Sound Tech. Any funds raised over the goal will go towards expenses for the 2015 Salt City Horror Fest.This is what you get:
A better viewing and listening experience
Opportunity to see over a dozen 35mm films
Satisfaction knowing you were part of a goal to save film screenings
Each perk involves different levels of film viewing events.  Recently we were blessed with a Brew & View 35mm Film sponsor.  The goal is to program four Brew & View 35mm Film screenings late 2014 and early 2015.  Depending on the perk you choose, you'll receive passes to the Brew & Views and the 2015 Salt City Horror Fest.  As contributions pour in, I will immediately put them towards the goals.

   The Impact
This production has a myriad of benefits. In a world where realism in theater has become a norm and the same ten shows are produced every year, we strive to bring our community a different kind of story. Eurydice is important because dealing with choices and growing up are all parts of the human experience. Everybody can relate to love, loss, grief, happiness, and being vulnerable because we are all human. It's important to have a way to express, acknowledge, and experience that with others in a safe environment. 
Every actor and person working on this production is not only talented, but willing to work on this show without pay due to their sheer passion and love for the community and each other. Everyone believes so strongly in the story, we simply must tell it in some way. 
Our production of Eurydice is a ""thank you"" to our community. It is our way to give back to those who have supported us and provided us with so much of our experiences. We are all young artists, looking to use our talents to form experiences with our communities by sharing stories. Eurydice is one of those many stories, and we hope to give you an experience you will never forget.

</blockquote><p>Taking PLace is a choreographic residency and experiment in creative process that brings together dance makers K.J. Holmes (NYC), Peter Kyle (NYC), Bebe Miller (Columbus), CoCo Loupe (Baton Rouge), and Claire Porter (NYC) in Ohio for the creation of new work with local dancers and a world-premiere concert event. The process - including workshops, rehearsals, interviews - are open to the public, and to guerilla-documentation. AND NOW, we are honored to join the trio of international dance festivals that Meta-academy invites you to engage online with this summer-Taking Place (July 1-13 in Columbus, OH, USA), Impulstanz/(July 21 -August 18 in Vienna, Austria), and Bates Dance Festival(July 21-August 11 in Lewiston, ME, USA). </p><p style=""text-align: right;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/683279/files/20140629193427-takingPlacePostcardHolmes.jpg?1404095667"" src="""" style=""""/></p><i>photographer unknown</i><p></p><p>Our guest artists live together, create dance and curate the concert event; collaborating with each other by working with dozens of local dancers and remotely with Meta-Academy participants from around the world. An adjudication process will provide commission for at least one Columbus choreographer to join the artists for the process and the production. Local musicians, photographers, video artists, and international media specialists are also collaborators of this creative process experiment.<br/></p><p></p><h3>This big EXPERIMENT costs a little money.</h3><p></p><p>NEW OPPORTUNITY!! Meta-Academy participants will engage with our guest artists via live-broadcast interviews; embodied google hangouts; and participation in threaded conversations on concept and process. We’ll share photos, videos, sound and text recordings as impetus for interaction and creation, and they can all be edited online to create participants' own documentary instances of what's Taking PLace .

I'm a dance maker, performer, teaching artist, and arts administrator. Since moving to Columbus in 2011 I've helped to open Feverhead, a funky lil dance and arts space; received a Choreographic Fellowship, Project funding, Professional Development and Technical Supply grants from the Greater Columbus Arts Council; I serve as company administrator for Bebe Miller Company; and facilitate and collaborate in events throughout the city.  <br/></p><p>I got the idea for Taking PLace after serving as an intern last summer at <a href=""http://www.bearnstow.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bearnstow</a>, where I studied with Peter Kyle, Claire Porter and K.J. Holmes, among several other creative facilitators. My arts administration work for Bebe Miller Company and Feverhead collaborations with CoCo Loupe have made these 5 artists important mentors to my creative process, dance-making, and question-asking. I saw an opportunity for collaboration - for them and for Columbus dancers - and along with some incredible committee members, have created the time and space for it. I need your help in raising the last bit of cash to pay the guest and local artists involved.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/683284/files/20140629193534-takingPlacePostcardMiller.jpg?1404095734"" src="""" style=""""/></p><i>photo: Julieta Cervantes</i><p></p>Taking PLace is funded-in-part by the <a href=""www.gcac.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Greater Columbus Arts Council </a>under the fiscal agency of the<a href=""www.shortnorthstage.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Short North Stage</a>. Co-sponsors <a href=""http://shortnorthstage.org/garden-theater"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Garden Theatre</a> and the <a href=""http://dance.osu.edu"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Department of Dance at The Ohio State University</a> have donated space and time for rehearsals and performances, and our media sponsor <a href=""http://wcbe.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">WCBE</a>  has provided us with free airtime.

The first was Locality 2012 a Columbus bicentennial celebration funded in part by the Ohio Arts Council and the Greater Columbus Arts Council.

<p></p></div>","Taking PLace is a choreographic residency and experiment in creative process that brings together dance makers K.J. Holmes (NYC), Peter Kyle (NYC), Bebe Miller (Columbus), CoCo Loupe (Baton Rouge), and Claire Porter (NYC) in Ohio for the creation of new work with local dancers and a world-premiere concert event. The process - including workshops, rehearsals, interviews - are open to the public, and to guerilla-documentation. AND NOW, we are honored to join the trio of international dance festivals that Meta-academy invites you to engage online with this summer-Taking Place (July 1-13 in Columbus, OH, USA), Impulstanz/(July 21 -August 18 in Vienna, Austria), and Bates Dance Festival(July 21-August 11 in Lewiston, ME, USA). photographer unknownOur guest artists live together, create dance and curate the concert event; collaborating with each other by working with dozens of local dancers and remotely with Meta-Academy participants from around the world. An adjudication process will provide commission for at least one Columbus choreographer to join the artists for the process and the production. Local musicians, photographers, video artists, and international media specialists are also collaborators of this creative process experiment.This big EXPERIMENT costs a little money.NEW OPPORTUNITY!! Meta-Academy participants will engage with our guest artists via live-broadcast interviews; embodied google hangouts; and participation in threaded conversations on concept and process. We’ll share photos, videos, sound and text recordings as impetus for interaction and creation, and they can all be edited online to create participants' own documentary instances of what's Taking PLace . This is a wonderful new opportunity for us and we are intrigued to see what will happen!Read more about our collaborators from meta-academy .I'm Nicole Garlando, coordinator of the experiment Taking PLace. I'm a dance maker, performer, teaching artist, and arts administrator. Since moving to Columbus in 2011 I've helped to open Feverhead, a funky lil dance and arts space; received a Choreographic Fellowship, Project funding, Professional Development and Technical Supply grants from the Greater Columbus Arts Council; I serve as company administrator for Bebe Miller Company; and facilitate and collaborate in events throughout the city.  I got the idea for Taking PLace after serving as an intern last summer at Bearnstow, where I studied with Peter Kyle, Claire Porter and K.J. Holmes, among several other creative facilitators. My arts administration work for Bebe Miller Company and Feverhead collaborations with CoCo Loupe have made these 5 artists important mentors to my creative process, dance-making, and question-asking. I saw an opportunity for collaboration - for them and for Columbus dancers - and along with some incredible committee members, have created the time and space for it. I need your help in raising the last bit of cash to pay the guest and local artists involved.photo: Julieta CervantesTaking PLace is funded-in-part by the Greater Columbus Arts Council under the fiscal agency of theShort North Stage. Co-sponsors The Garden Theatre and the Department of Dance at The Ohio State University have donated space and time for rehearsals and performances, and our media sponsor WCBE  has provided us with free airtime. And now-Dance-tech.net is facilitating our presence in the 2014 Meta-Academy. We are immensely grateful for our local funding, private donations, and generous in-kind resources! What We Need & What You GetWe want everyone working so hard to be paid!! Our collaborators are: 5 guest choreographers, 20 local dancers, 2 local photographers, 2 local video artists, 3 local musicians, and 2 international media artists. Our guests' artistic caliber is high - including a Guggenheim Fellow and a Bessie Award Winner - and the local talent is stellar. The dedication of committee members and cast members is unprecedented. How we'll spend the money:After fees paid to Indiegogo and to our fiscal agent, which total 11.75% of funds raised, all dollars go to paying the artist stipends.The ImpactYou can help this BIG little project as we enter the global spotlight, and help connect communities around the world with choreographic knowledge, creative process, methodologies, ideas and more... who knows what may happen?!  Taking PLace is the second Columbus dance festival I've coordinated. The first was Locality 2012 a Columbus bicentennial celebration funded in part by the Ohio Arts Council and the Greater Columbus Arts Council. It was a highly successful weekend festival and site-specific tour of dance in our city's spaces. It featured a stage concert and a gallery of creative process, workshops, and a 4-hour bus tour for which we commissioned 12 local choreographers to create new work.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Sadler's Wells liked our work so much that we will be premiering it in London at Sadler's Wells, with our very own Wildcard on 8th June 2017.</p>
<p>We want to reach a mixed audience including those not usually interested in dance through this issue based work. My intention is to  attract a mixed audience, including men as there are inferences relating to masculinity (not to just preach to the converted).</p>
<p>With the theme of gender in society and specifically perceptions of women’s role is universal, and following Michelle Obama's wonderful speech in October, and the surprising US election results, I feel this work has arrived at a poignant time. </p>
<p>To date, people have said:</p>
<p>'Strong &amp; Empowering' Richmix</p>
<p>'Brilliant show and Q&amp;A session' Mandinga</p>
<p>'Timeless and current issues that women continue to face everyday' The Tabernacle </p>
<p>'Absolutely stunning and provocative piece I saw last night , thank you for the inspiration and celebration of your exploration!!!' Yorkshire Dance</p>

Jodie has been working within the Creative Arts for the past 5 years in Costume and Visual Aesthetics within Dance Theatre. Her experience as a researcher in marketing, television and radio, along with her passion for art and dance have given Jodie a well-rounded background in creative arts. She has worked with the Company since 2012. She has made costumes for Ivan Blackstock, Young Vic and Breakin Convention to name a few.
 

The Impact
Sadler's Wells liked our work so much that we will be premiering it in London at Sadler's Wells, with our very own Wildcard on 8th June 2017.
We want to reach a mixed audience including those not usually interested in dance through this issue based work. My intention is to  attract a mixed audience, including men as there are inferences relating to masculinity (not to just preach to the converted).
With the theme of gender in society and specifically perceptions of women’s role is universal, and following Michelle Obama's wonderful speech in October, and the surprising US election results, I feel this work has arrived at a poignant time. 
To date, people have said:
'Strong & Empowering' Richmix
'Brilliant show and Q&A session' Mandinga
'Timeless and current issues that women continue to face everyday' The Tabernacle 
'Absolutely stunning and provocative piece I saw last night , thank you for the inspiration and celebration of your exploration!!!' Yorkshire Dance
'Completely engaged- enthralling, emotional, inspiring and grounding work' Mercy Nabirye

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><i>CARMILLA</i> is a stage adaptation of the Gothic novella by Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu, one of the earliest works of vampire fiction, predating Bram Stoker's Dracula by 26 years. Set in a Victorian world, <i>CARMILLA</i> explores themes of queer sexuality, gender, sexual agency, and toxic masculinity through burlesque, horror, camp, drama, romance, and sensuality.<br/><br/>Pointed Cap Playhouse is thrilled to present the world premiere of <i>CARMILLA</i> at the St. Ambroise Montreal Fringe Festival with 6 shows May 31st-June 8th, and at The Toronto Fringe Festival with 10 shows July 4th-15. <br/><br/>Pointed Cap Playhouse is a collaborative theatre &amp; burlesque company led by Sly Feiticeira and St. Stella, focused on innovative, immersive, interactive productions exploring roles of gender, stereotypes, and interpretation of classic tropes using theatre, comedy, music &amp; striptease. As two full-time artists, we strive to create uniquely beautiful experiences for our audience while respecting the time, talent and craft that each of our artists brings to the production. This is where we need your help!<br/><br/><i>CARMILLA</i> is a ""profit-share"" production, meaning all proceeds are split between our team. Most of these proceeds come from ticket sales.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am Kara M. Tyler. I've been a theatre maker in one form or another for some 20+ years. My artist life was rolling along in LA &amp; NYC, until 3 years ago when I was struck with an acute case of complete artistic boredom. I needed to create with a new perspective, hear new voices, younger voices, as of yet unheard voices. So I packed up my life in the States and came to Graduate school in England. </p>
<p>During my 2 years back in school I have become painfully aware of the non-balance of our storytelling, that our plight for inclusivity is still lacking in certain demographics, and in particular  we are often ill equipped and short- sighted in our work with actors with ""disabilities"". We cannot claim that art represents life if we do not represent ALL of life.  When I read <i>'Woman of Flowers'</i> by Kaite O'Reilly, I fell in love with the poetry and nuance, with the cultural references, the female voice of the writing, and the thrill that our heroine, who is deaf, uses a combination of Sign language (BSL), lip reading and speaking English that will bring the  D/deaf and hearing communities together as one audience.  </p>
<p>My MFA (Master Fine Arts) program provides me the theatre, tech team, and basic props and costumes.  Outside of my University I  have managed to pull together an amazing team of 4 wonderful actors, a gifted Assistant Director, a Music Director who's creating original music with his musicians, and a movement choreographer.</p>
<p><i>What I don't have is a budget to provide props &amp;  possible BSL interpretive support the school cannot offer and to alleviate travel and basic expenses for the actors &amp; creatives.  </i>They are a gifted lot of people putting HOURS into a project out of passion and a desire to honor art, inclusivity and the human experience.  As all ticket sales will go back to the University there will be nothing covering my out of pocket expenses (accrued on top of the fees of being a student!). </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need £1200 to cover:</p>
<p><strong>Actors stipend:</strong> travel, lunch, transporting instruments, etc. This is just to cover their expenses--but the more you donate the more goes to also covering some of their time (*They are volunteering their CAREER hours--not everyone would do that for their profession!).</p>
<p><strong>Props: </strong>There will be some things not covered by the school budget ie; Bodhran (Irish drum) </p>
<p><strong>Marketing:</strong>  It would be nice to have physical postcards/flyers outside of the social networking and media marketing.</p>
<p><strong>AND</strong> if we are able to achieve our goal or higher we would also like to make a donation to <strong>Deaf Unity </strong>who's mission is to unite the deaf community locally, regionally and globally. As we are a cast of English, Welsh, Scottish, Australian and American artists it seems befitting to pick a charity that empowers deaf communities around the world. </p>
<p>What do you get?! </p>
<p>You will be listed in our programs donors page for your generosity and receive a personalized thank you video from the rehearsal room! And the satisfaction in knowing that you were a contributor not just to the arts but in being one step closer to 'normalizing' a more inclusive future for the theatre.</p>
<p>I would like to make note that my University, like many, does not have captioning, nor a budget for a show interpreter.  To make this work for both the Deaf and Hearing audience I am typing the whole show into powerpoint and projecting as we go. The other challenge is that sign language, as a visual language (which is different for each country- <strong>B</strong>ritish <strong>S</strong>ign <strong>L</strong>anguage here) takes hours of creative interpreting and aside from an interpreter to the hearing community, a BSL creative consultant would normally be called in. However Creative Consultants are not part of a Government funded budget and an expense that myself and most small companies are unable to afford.  This presents more working time and pressure for the Deaf actors and their directors. Because of the challenges involved many companies/Universities are prevented from undertaking  projects like '<i>Woman of Flowers'.</i>  I would love to one day see captioning and interpreters as part of our mainstream working life.  But this will only happen if the need is exposed.</p>

<h3>What is Human Resources?</h3>
<p>Human Resources is a brand new musical with book and lyrics by Mallory Schlossberg, music by Mallory Schlossberg and Alexandra Smith, and arrangements/scoring by Alexandra Smith. This December, we'll be premiering it for the first time ever on Zoom! </p>
<p><strong>The plot (without spoilers!)</strong></p>
<p>Emily Silverberg is a writer who is down on her luck after losing her job at a pseudo-health startup. Her job was supposed to cover IVF and infertility treatments, and now she can't afford them. (She's got a lot of debt from her MFA program.) Her supportive husband, Max, encourages her to apply to work at a bigger and better company—the health food empire Greener Pastures—but before Emily can even apply, she gets a mysterious message from the company's recruiter, who asks her if she wants to be part of something bigger than herself. Once Emily starts working at Greener Pastures, she begins to suspect something’s not quite right. The company's mission is to ""to feed the earth,"" and...let's just say they do that very literally. </p>
<p>Human Resources takes a twist from work-place satire to full-on B-horror comedy. It's a campy, over-the-top musical with original songs that asks us what we'd be willing to give up for purpose and a place, while simultaneously tearing down the systems that prevent us from truly succeeding.</p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>Why we're doing this fundraiser</strong></p>
<p>Producing independent theater takes a lot. Yes, even though we are able to save money from not having rehearsal spaces/a theater, there are lots of other costs involved. We've got musicians, technicians, actors, and beyond making this show come to life. There's marketing and promotional costs. We've got to send critical materials to performers, production equipment, props, and more. And whatever we can give to the artists we will. <b>Additionally, show tickets will be pay-what-you-can and will be divided up among the artists involved. So even if you don't donate now, we encourage you to pay for a ticket when we air the show in December - it will help support artists!</b></p>

If we don't reach our goal, we'll still be able to use what we have to fund aspects of the show. 
We can't give up on making new theater, and we can't give up on artists.
Other Ways You Can Help
Can't contribute? Feel free to get the word out by sharing this! Or, as stated above, seeing the show later and (if you can) buying tickets.
Thank you!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div><strong>Hi everyone! My name is Annie Grove, and I am one step - or flight - away from fulfilling a dream. In high school, I participated in many fundraising efforts for both community and world-wide projects. After graduating, I delayed admission to college so I could volunteer full-time in a South Philadelphia middle school. I work 50 hours a week, take dance classes, and study with an acting teacher. At the same time, I'm applying to universities and conservatories for 2013-2014. I live on a small stipend that averages about $3 an hour.</strong></div>
<div><strong> </strong></div>
<div>
<strong> My dream is to become a professional actress and bring theatre into everyone's life, especially those who might never experience it. </strong><strong>In everything I've done, I've been brave enough to start and strong enough to finish. </strong><strong>For the last two years of high school, I earned a scholarship to a performing arts high school. I have worked part-time since I was 15. Now I need help for one more step in my education.</strong>

<h2><strong>             What I Need and How You Can Help :)</strong></h2>
<div><strong>Recently, I auditioned for the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. The school embodies a rigorous and academic craft unlike any other. I was given a final callback, which means that I must travel to London. This is the most incredible opportunity I've ever been given. The Guildhall panel sees over 2,300 hopeful applicants each season, and they invite only a handful back to London. However, I don't have airfare to London. Without the funds to travel, I cannot audition and earn a place in the school.</strong></div>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Plane tickets are about $1,000-$1,700 dollars during the season. Once I get to London, I have a place to stay. I still need to budget a small amount for food and emergency money.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<div><strong>Even if I don't reach my entire goal, all of the donated funds will go towards my plane ticket. I'm trying many different avenues to raise this money, and I realize that the amount will come together in small amounts. For that reason, all amounts are equally appreciated. A family friend once said, ""Never disregard a penny. Without it, 99 cents can't become a dollar.""</strong></div>
<h2><strong> </strong></h2>
<h2><strong>                   What This Means To Me</strong></h2>
<div><strong>When Guildhall invited me to come to London, I had to sit down because I almost fainted. Working with students this year has transformed and inspired me. Better than ever, I understand how theatre can unite a divided planet, and every child deserves the chance to experience great performances. I feel that it is finally my time to chase a dream.</strong></div>
<div><strong>First, I have to attend my callback for Guildhall! While I'm in London, I will attend various classes, workshops and interviews. This is an incredibly competitive program that requires not only maturity, but strength and everlasting passion as well. </strong></div>
<div><strong>I am very humble in asking for help.  To me, $1,300 seems like a huge amount, but I'm confident in my ability to succeed. Any penny spared is greatly appreciated.</strong></div>

</div></div>","Our Story

My name is Cleveland Dominy. I live in the Hill Country near
Austin, Texas. I have been in law enforcement since 1987. I have always had a
passion for writing and storytelling. At the present time I have completed six
books and numerous one-act plays. I feel it is time for me to pursue my true
passion in life as being a writer and storyteller. 
 
Bravura Theatre Company is going to produce three of my
plays in â€œAn Evening of One-Acts by Cleveland Dominyâ€ in the spring of 2012.
The plays in this production are Because
I Love You, Old Dime Box, and One Suicide is Enough. 

Excerpts from the
plays can be seen at http://www.native-heart.com
under writings. 
 
Bravura Theatre Company was founded in 2006 by Jake Coe â€“ a
young, enthusiastic actor who is passionate about live theatre.
 
Possum Box Productions (http://www.possumbox.tv/
) will film
our plays. Possum Box is a brand new production company founded and created by
a group of very talented young adults in Austin, TX. 

Costumes and advisory will be by Virginia Davis of Midnight Breeze Designs:  http://www.midnightbreezedesigns.com. 
 
I am fortunate to have a network of very talented actors and artists who believe in me. We will be able to schedule a practice and performance venue
when we begin receiving funds. We have scouted out several theatre venues in
Austin where the majority of our team members live, work, and play. Our team
will construct the sets, find props, manage the light and sound, create the
costumes, cast, direct, and film,
 



The Impact

My goal is that our production of my plays will give other
writers, performers, and artists hope that there is a way that they, too, can
get their works out there. It will offer an opportunity for local performers to
practice their craft and help the young start up theatre and production
companies to gain recognition. 
 
This is a link in a circle of very talented people who are
seeking an avenue to display their creation and talents, including myself.
Without it dreams vanish.
 
An Evening of One-Acts by Cleveland Dominy will be an entertaining
night out for anyone attending and show all that there is hope in these tough
times.
 
If this venture doesnâ€™t happen then the young Americans who are
trying to get recognition for their talents will not get this opportunity and
there will be one less casting call in Austin which might have led to some promising
performer being discovered.
 
What We Need & What You Get



Our main expense is the fees for the practice and performance
venue. We need $3000 for renting the venue, constructing the sets, costumes, printing the playbills and programs, and advertising.
 
We are all just working people without the means to fulfill
these dreams. Without the support of our contributors we will be unable to
accomplish our goal.
 
You help to bring new talent and original works that have never
been seen out into the world. You will be there at the ground level of the launch of many
talents.

</div></div>","The Story

        In this dark tragicomic play, the emperor Caligula has just suffered the loss of his beloved wife Drusilla and, shocked by the horror and meaninglessness of life, takes it out on Rome. He murders elected officials at random, impersonates Venus, goddess of love, and demands nothing less than the moon.

Background
 
The idea to put on Caligula arose when some of the team members were having an intellectual discussion about the ills of our time. Assistant Director Marianne brought up Caligula by Nobel Prize winner Albert Camus. Director Ittai Orr's search for a great, utterly shocking play to put on spring of his senior year had ended, and the team already in place could not be more excited and passionate about the production, not to mention enthralled with the play's wit and style. The only problem was that the existing English translation was stodgy, British, and old. That's why Marianne and Ittai set out to create a new, energetic adaptation, which now sees the stage for the first time.
The stellar cast is led by New York City native Samson Kohanski, who comes to the role of Caligula after studying at Michael Howard Studios and performing with the American Repertory Theatre, the Strawberry One Act Festival and the Commonwealth Shakespeare Company in Boston. 
Performance dates are Friday, March 30th at 8pm and Saturday March 31st at 3pm and 8pm at the Roy Arias Little Theater at Times Square. Tickets can be purchased here: http://caligula.ticketleap.com/caligula/
 



Why Now?
 
 A sense of loss and helplessness has been thick in the air. And one of the darker consequences of loss is rage, a feeling this play certainly captures. Still, there is hope, however brief and quiet, and it’s the excitement of that possibility that makes Caligula a worthwhile production. It’s the perfect time to put this on, when like Caligula, many seriously subscribe to the notion that “freedom must always come at someone else’s expense."" There is, as Camus would suggest, another way. Caligula speaks to a universal and deeply personal feeling of loss that everyone goes through at least once in their lives. It sheds light on the profound questions still left open by the bloody twentieth century. A truly ensemble effort, it draws from the strengths and passions of the entire team.
