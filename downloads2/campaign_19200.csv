</p><p></p><p><span><b>Short Summary</b></span></p><p>        REVELATION will premiere at the Solo Creation Festival at Son of Semele Theater this July. It is a movement based piece connecting three generations of women in my family walking the knife’s edge of insanity and inspiration. As an actor, original work gives me the fuel to continue my artistic career by asking questions that matter. How can we glorify and shun insanity at the same time? Are we so far from our own natural concept of balance that we must be told what that means? Can mental health  can be explored in a subconscious, creative, and personal way? How can a family mythology be mined for truth? My goal is to develop this into a full length piece that can be performed in numerous locations and by contributing to this campaign you will be part of the genesis of a larger project. Strongly establishing REVELATION in its premiere will help my applications for grants and fellowships, expanding this piece and reaching a larger audience. With the proper budget, I will be able to achieve the aesthetic and overall feel of the piece and set a high standard for the entire life of this project. Right now the piece’s only budget is out of my pocket so any contribution will help!</p><br/><p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p><br/><p>        This project has a lot of small elements that add up to $1,500 but the largest part will go to the set, which involves a few key pieces. Se Oh, a talented young designer working in LA is working with me to make this the best set possible. Innovative lighting will add to the traditional lights of theater using actual pieces on stage. The sound designed by Fionnegan Murphy will add to the environment of the play. The talented video designer Keith Skretch will oversee the projections envisioned by the director, Gabe Figueroa, and myself. With the proper budget we can find the best costumes to heighten the story. E.B. Brooks has generously offered to serve as a liaison for wardrobe which well help further define the characters. If I exceed my goal, I could even pay these amazing artists who are working with me! (we do this for the love of theater but it is always good to get a little more compensation!). Some marketing materials are provided by Son of Semele but with added funding I can reach even more people to fill the audience for the run and future performances. To ensure that future, this campaign also covers the cost of applications fees for fellowships and grants to develop a full length piece next year.

In New York, I directed a performance piece at Galapagos Art Space and adapted a reading of Philip K. Dick’s UBIK performed at The Bushwick Starr for the SITE festival. I have extensive training in creating original work as an ensemble and that enriches my work as a solo artist. This will be my first public performance of a self-generated work in Los Angeles and I expect it to meet and exceed my previous standards.

<p><em>It’s David vs. Goliath – but not a slingshot in sight! When shepherd boy David is prophesized to become the next king… heck, he’d rather be a rock star, anyway. Not that tough guy Goliath’ll let some freakin’ sheep-lover take the crown, setting the stage for the biblical rivals to clash in an epic Guitar Hero battle! Following a successful run in the UK, this family-friendly rock musical takes on the issue of bullying as it spins its tale of a little guy who must overcome obstacles, face fears and finally: Stand Tall!</em></p>
<p>In 2009 the Stand Tall writing team had an idea to write a musical for everyone with a topic that everyone on the planet can relate too…bullying. Almost everyone you know has experienced bullying in some way either as a victim or as a bully. Stand Tall the musical was inspired by all of these people and was written for people of all ages with a hope it would inspire everyone to stand up and break the cycle.</p>
<p>In 2010 Stand Tall was performed under the name David V Goliath by a group of exceptionally talented young drama students in Oxfordshire UK. These young talented performers were inspirational in their delivery of the subject matter and received justified critical acclaim for their performance. The show also won the Princess Diana Award for Anti-Bullying due to its efforts in tackling an issue in such an engaging way.</p>
<p>In 2011 Stand Tall received its first professional production in London UK. A hugely successful 5 week run was again critically well received and the writing team had very little time to sit back and take stock at how their show idea in 2009 was being performed in London in less than two years.</p>
<p>Now in 2012, Stand Tall has been invited to the New York Musical Theatre Festival, this incredible story continues…</p>

<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Stand Tall is at a crucial time in its development.  It has been offered a world renowned festival theater stage on which to fully mount this work for the first time in the US.

We are raising money to make this showcase the best it can be. Our showcase is instrumental in the pathway towards a flourishing future. In the past, this showcase lead to actors getting cast and signing with agents, thus joining the highly competitive and passionate ranks of working and successful actors. 


During this campaign, we need to raise $2,500. This money will go
towards the rental of a theatre space within the Abingdon Theatre Complex, conveniently located in the heart of Midtown Manhattan. The showcase will take place over three days, with two performances on each of these days. Other costs include
the snacks, water and much needed wine for the invitees at every performance.
(These people are extremely busy and deserve a little respite!) 
The good
news?! You are welcome to come and see the showcase! You would have
been directly involved in the creation of a successful showcase. After all the
preparation we will have done, it will be one heck of a show! 
Because of your help, we will create an event that will change our lives. Thank you, we are immeasurably appreciative of your support. Please tell your friends and family about our cause!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>PDragonfire!</h3>
<p>Jennifer Himes is a puppeteer based in Orlando, Florida. This is her first public theatre production.</p>
<p>“Dragonfire stems directly from my desire to express myself and my faith in a unique way. I knew had something important to say, but I didn’t know what it was or how to say it. The idea of that desire burning inside gave me the idea for the character Kenna (which is an old Celtic name meaning born of flames), from her came the dragons, from them came the story.” Dragonfire asks, “how do stories help the suffering?” And answers by showing a little girl finding her very own dragonfire inside, using it to call on the Third Dragon herself and send a demon dog running. </p>
<p>The project has received a small grant from the Experimental Puppetry Theatre Program for all other expenses, so it is a guaranteed to be on stage. When you support Dragonfire, however big or small, you will be helping Jennifer and her team bring the story to life by giving toward practical needs like food, housing and travel while in Atlanta for the performances.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>You might be asking, “If you’ve already received a grant, why do you need more money?” The grant will cover the cost of materials, but there are other needs. Here is where your donation will be put to use.</p>

<li>The Dragonfire team is mostly based in Orlando, Florida. Our first priority is money for travel, food and housing while on the road. </li>
<li>Payment for the Orlando-based performers giving their time to develop, rehearse and perform the show.</li>

<h3>Hello Friends, and people I wish were my friends.</h3>
<p>I'm Laura Levites and I am comedian.  I have been invited to perform at the Gilded Ballon for the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, which is the largest arts festival in the world. (by the way, and if you don't believe me google it.)  It's an honor to be performing at the Gilded Balloon, because it's responsible for launching the careers of many great comics and performers.  I'd like to be one of those people.</p>
<p>I'm producing my own show, ""Selfhelpless"" and boy it's expensive.  So this is me asking for your help.  I need some money, well lots of it.  So if you have any that you can spare, I will gladly take it off your hands and make good use of it.</p>
<p>I need plane fare, train tickets, lodging, promotion materials, flyers posters etc...</p>
<p>I know it sounds like a lot of money, but keep in mind that it's in the UK, Scotland and well the U.S. dollar is worthless there, so take the dollar amount and cut that in half.  Yep, cut in it half which means a burger that costs 10 pounds is actually 20 dollars.  I think they are getting back at us for declaring Independance from them.</p>
<p>Why should you help me?  Because my shrink says that I'm worthy of being helped, but I'm not sure I believe him yet.  Asking for help is a very difficult thing to do.  My show is called ""Selfhelpless"" and it's about my journey of self help and questioning whether or not it can be achieved.  Everyone needs help once in a while.  So I'm asking for it, please help me. </p>
<p>This is what the Press say about me.  I'm just glad it's Press and not my mother, because she would say something much different.</p>
<h3>
<strong><em>“Laura Levites is a truly distinct new voice on the UK comedy scene.  Definitely one to keep tabs on.”</em></strong>-The Scotsman</h3>
<h3>
<strong>“A very funny girl” </strong>-The Skinny</h3>
<h3>
<em><strong>“I have a feeling that this lady could be a major player in the near future.”</strong></em> -One4Review</h3>
<h3>
<em><strong>“Levites is both loveable and crazy and her delivery and character is just as entertaining as her storytelling.”</strong>  </em>-Broadway Baby</h3>
<h3>
<em><strong>“It’s Levites disarming honesty and vivacious personality that inexorably captivates you, making you care for her and her story.”  </strong></em>-The Examiner</h3>
<h3>
<em><strong>“You’ll laugh loudly as you enjoy the scatty narrative of this womans hilarious journey of self discovery.” </strong></em>-StageWon</h3>
<p>I made it bigger because I need to remind myself that people say nice things about me.</p>

</div></div>","Hello Friends, and people I wish were my friends.
I'm Laura Levites and I am comedian.  I have been invited to perform at the Gilded Ballon for the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, which is the largest arts festival in the world. (by the way, and if you don't believe me google it.)  It's an honor to be performing at the Gilded Balloon, because it's responsible for launching the careers of many great comics and performers.  I'd like to be one of those people.
I'm producing my own show, ""Selfhelpless"" and boy it's expensive.  So this is me asking for your help.  I need some money, well lots of it.  So if you have any that you can spare, I will gladly take it off your hands and make good use of it.
I need plane fare, train tickets, lodging, promotion materials, flyers posters etc...
I know it sounds like a lot of money, but keep in mind that it's in the UK, Scotland and well the U.S. dollar is worthless there, so take the dollar amount and cut that in half.  Yep, cut in it half which means a burger that costs 10 pounds is actually 20 dollars.  I think they are getting back at us for declaring Independance from them.
Why should you help me?  Because my shrink says that I'm worthy of being helped, but I'm not sure I believe him yet.  Asking for help is a very difficult thing to do.  My show is called ""Selfhelpless"" and it's about my journey of self help and questioning whether or not it can be achieved.  Everyone needs help once in a while.  So I'm asking for it, please help me. 
This is what the Press say about me.  I'm just glad it's Press and not my mother, because she would say something much different.

“Laura Levites is a truly distinct new voice on the UK comedy scene.  Definitely one to keep tabs on.”-The Scotsman

“A very funny girl” -The Skinny

“I have a feeling that this lady could be a major player in the near future.” -One4Review

“Levites is both loveable and crazy and her delivery and character is just as entertaining as her storytelling.”  -Broadway Baby

“It’s Levites disarming honesty and vivacious personality that inexorably captivates you, making you care for her and her story.”  -The Examiner

“You’ll laugh loudly as you enjoy the scatty narrative of this womans hilarious journey of self discovery.” -StageWon
I made it bigger because I need to remind myself that people say nice things about me.

The Significance
Our contributors for the first leg of the show are still on board- they provided, we delivered!


Putting a smart female character on stage is GREAT for women AND men to see. Especially one who is working in what is, traditionally, a guy's field..
Our fundraising cabarets last year were sold out, and with every performance of Greasemonkey, the audience got bigger and bigger. People are still asking for more shows, six months later. The enthusiasm just keeps growing!

<p><i style=""font-weight: bold;"">5 SIRENS: BEWARE OF ROCKS </i>is a collection of short plays united by universal themes. World premiering at the 2015 Hollywood Fringe Festival, this collaboration was created especially for the Fringe by USC Master of Professional Writing grads and playwrights Sarah Dzida, Autumn McAlpin, Kiera Nowacki, Caron Tate, and Laurel Wetzork, and will be directed by Laura Steinroeder. Through the eclectic lenses of alien encounters, terminal nerd-dom, sibling rivalry, sub/dom relationships, and devastating family illness, <i>5 SIRENS</i> delves into our deep-rooted human desires for connection and communication but recognizes the fact that sometimes, no matter how hard we try, no matter what we're willing to do, those desires may not be met.</p>
<p><b>WE NEED YOU!!!</b> to support us as we bring our stories to life onstage. Your contribution will help cover the costs of our rehearsal and production space and costs, marketing expenses, and help us feed and pay our amazing professional actors and crew. <b>THANK YOU </b>for donating, liking, and sharing our campaign as we aim to captivate you with our song!</p>

<b>SARAH DZIDA</b> started out in the theatre biz as a critic for KXLU's Center Stage with Mark Gordon, but the siren song of writing hooked her out of it. Since then, she's written a lot.

Her creative nonfiction has appeared in <i>MARY: A Journal of Writing and Sushi and Sake Magazine</i>. She's working on her second novel, and when not writing, she's probably reading.</div><div>

</div></div>","Our Story


5 SIRENS: BEWARE OF ROCKS is a collection of short plays united by universal themes. World premiering at the 2015 Hollywood Fringe Festival, this collaboration was created especially for the Fringe by USC Master of Professional Writing grads and playwrights Sarah Dzida, Autumn McAlpin, Kiera Nowacki, Caron Tate, and Laurel Wetzork, and will be directed by Laura Steinroeder. Through the eclectic lenses of alien encounters, terminal nerd-dom, sibling rivalry, sub/dom relationships, and devastating family illness, 5 SIRENS delves into our deep-rooted human desires for connection and communication but recognizes the fact that sometimes, no matter how hard we try, no matter what we're willing to do, those desires may not be met.
WE NEED YOU!!! to support us as we bring our stories to life onstage. Your contribution will help cover the costs of our rehearsal and production space and costs, marketing expenses, and help us feed and pay our amazing professional actors and crew. THANK YOU for donating, liking, and sharing our campaign as we aim to captivate you with our song!

Support female playwrights and support our Sirens' song at the 2015 Hollywood Fringe Festival -- L.A.'s largest celebration of the Performing Arts. 
THE STORIES:
DON'T PANIC by Sarah DzidaWhen put-together Paige announces she might die, it’s up to her sister to calm her down.
TEN YEARS LEFT by Autumn McAlpinA woman struggles to find her voice as she interacts with her doctor, family, and agent after being diagnosed with a debilitating disease.

OUT OF HERE by Laurel WetzorkA bi-sexed Alien and a guy from Missouri have different ideas about inter-species communication, with dire results.
WHATEVER WORKS by Caron TateA man with dangerously out of control anger issues knows he needs help, but is he getting it soon enough for the woman he’s involved with?
SPOCK AT BAT by Kiera NowackiA man and a woman meet at a company softball championship, but find they have very little in common as they each try to translate jock and nerd speak into terms the other will understand.

THE SIRENS:

SARAH DZIDA started out in the theatre biz as a critic for KXLU's Center Stage with Mark Gordon, but the siren song of writing hooked her out of it. Since then, she's written a lot. Her fiction has appeared on The Huffington Post. Her poetry can be found online and one time in an exhibit at the Architecture + Design Museum in 2012. Her creative nonfiction has appeared in MARY: A Journal of Writing and Sushi and Sake Magazine. She's working on her second novel, and when not writing, she's probably reading.


AUTUMN McALPIN is an award-winning playwright, filmmaker, and author. A soon-to-be graduate of USC’s Master of Professional Writing program, Autumn’s play, IN FRONT OF THE CHILDREN, won first place at this year’s Writing for Stage and Screen competition at USC. She also co-wrote and produced the upcoming feature film WAFFLE STREET, starring James Lafferty, Danny Glover, and Julie Gonzalo, which she adapted for screen from James Adams’ 2010 memoir of the same name. A mother of four, Autumn also runs the non-profit Aspire Higher, which matches families to volunteerism causes.

East coast or west, LAUREL WETZORK's been involved in the stage and screen. She's studied it—a BA from USC's film school in cinema production, and a Master of Professional Writing (USC), with a concentration in stage and screen. She's worked in it—as an award-winning writer, feature-film director, member of the Dramatists Guild, as a volunteer onstage editor for LAFPI (Los Angeles Female Playwrights Initiative). She also supports writers and playwrights as a member and volunteer of the International Centre for Women Playwrights. She puts sirens in most of her work (the police and female kind).



CARON TATE produced and appeared in her first full-length play BUMPS back in her days as a performer of stage and television in the Washington DC/Baltimore area. More recently, she is a graduate of the USC Master of Professional Writing program. While at USC, her play POWER POINTS won first place for the Writing for Stage and Screen Annual Competition. Her poetry received an Honorable Mention in the Edward W. Moses poetry competition. Caron's published work includes fiction, poetry, and memoir. She is also a Gamma to two perfect grandbabeeze.


KIERA NOWACKI studied theater at Rhodes College in Memphis, TN, where she wrote and directed an adaptation of Ernest Hemingway's short story, Hills Like White Elephants. She also studied masked theater in Arezzo, Italy at the Academica dell'Arte, an experience which informs her comedic sensibility. She is a recent graduate of USC's Master of Professional Writing program, where her short play, A HUNDRED MAYS, received second runner up in the Writing for Stage and Screen Annual Competition in 2013.

<p>This summer we will take off on our greatest adventure yet: we have secured a spot at one of the top venues at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival - the legendary Gilded Balloon (celebrating its 30<sup>th</sup> Anniversary this year) - where we will be taking our hit show Morro and Jasp do Puberty.

<p>Although we are known around the world for producing professional-level ballet dancers, many people in our own backyard are unaware of the Kirov Academy of Ballet. By Getting to the Lisner Auditorium, George Washington University's 1,500 seat world-class venue, we will increase awareness of the school in the Washington, DC community so that we can secure coveted funding from individual donors, build an endowment and reaffirm our spot as one of the top classical ballet academies in the world, for generations to come.</p>
<p><strong>Getting to the Lisner</strong> is make or break for our school. After having produced a major performance off campus only one other time, we are now attempting to do something that has never been done in the 23-year history of the school—mount a second consecutive major production off campus at a main stage venue, instead of holding it on campus as we usually do. We are planning to present our <strong>2013 Spring Performance Series at the Lisner Auditorium</strong> - <strong><em>featuring La Sylphide Act II and George Balanchine's Allegro Brillante, May 23-25, 2013.</em></strong>  If we are successful, we know that the heightened local awareness will help solidify the school's reputation and attract the types of funders who can help us grow. Because, honestly, we are a leading ballet academy with student dancers who can perform on par with those at professional companies.</p>
<p>But this move to the Lisner and the enhanced visibility that it will bring us requires an investment—a bigger investment than we've ever made before for a single production. Bottom line: we need $75,000 to make these performances a reality. </p>
<p>Production costs can add up quickly. For example, we need $30,000 to secure the venue, $5,000 to pay the guest choreographer, $20,000 for scenery and costumes, and $20,000 for media buys and printing to promote the show. </p>
<p>Your support will help us pull it off.</p>
<p>In return you'll experience some awesome perks including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Roundtrip airfare for 2 to St. Petersburg, Russia to visit the famed Mariinsky Theatre</li>
<li>a 3 Night Stay in Washington, DC at the luxurious Dupont Circle Hotel</li>
<li>VIP tickets to our performances</li>
<li>Exclusive KAB gear, and much more… </li>
</ul><p>If we are successfully able to produce this spring performance series, we KNOW that we will significantly enhance the school's credibility and visibility, and signal that we have truly arrived on the scene.</p>
<p>Your contribution is a vote of support that we need to move to bigger venues, woo larger audiences, and create the groundswell of support required to help our academy continue to thrive. </p>
<p>We would value your contribution - no matter how small! And in addition to donating money to the campaign, you can help us in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share our campaign with your friends on Facebook and Twitter</li>
<li>Send an email to friends who you think would support our cause</li>
<li>Tell people about our amazing school and students</li>
</ul><p>Thank you for your support!</p>

Getting to the Lisner is make or break for our school. After having produced a major performance off campus only one other time, we are now attempting to do something that has never been done in the 23-year history of the school—mount a second consecutive major production off campus at a main stage venue, instead of holding it on campus as we usually do. We are planning to present our 2013 Spring Performance Series at the Lisner Auditorium - featuring La Sylphide Act II and George Balanchine's Allegro Brillante, May 23-25, 2013.  If we are successful, we know that the heightened local awareness will help solidify the school's reputation and attract the types of funders who can help us grow. Because, honestly, we are a leading ballet academy with student dancers who can perform on par with those at professional companies.
But this move to the Lisner and the enhanced visibility that it will bring us requires an investment—a bigger investment than we've ever made before for a single production. Bottom line: we need $75,000 to make these performances a reality. 
Production costs can add up quickly. For example, we need $30,000 to secure the venue, $5,000 to pay the guest choreographer, $20,000 for scenery and costumes, and $20,000 for media buys and printing to promote the show. 
Your support will help us pull it off.
In return you'll experience some awesome perks including:

Roundtrip airfare for 2 to St. Petersburg, Russia to visit the famed Mariinsky Theatre
a 3 Night Stay in Washington, DC at the luxurious Dupont Circle Hotel
VIP tickets to our performances
Exclusive KAB gear, and much more… 
If we are successfully able to produce this spring performance series, we KNOW that we will significantly enhance the school's credibility and visibility, and signal that we have truly arrived on the scene.
Your contribution is a vote of support that we need to move to bigger venues, woo larger audiences, and create the groundswell of support required to help our academy continue to thrive.

<p>What if we could walk with Brad Majors and Janet Weiss all the way from
Betty and Ralph's wedding to and throughout Frank’s mansion? </p>
<p>Brisbane Management Group (BMG) is raising funds to produce an immersive,
interactive production of <i>The Rocky
Horror Show</i> in the style of a Haunted House tour, to run throughout the
month of October, just in time for Halloween. BMG’s goal is to produce <b>art that improves community</b>. By setting
the production in various undeveloped and secret spaces in Munhall, we hope to bring
Pittsburgh patrons to a new location to participate in theater to bring the
Munhall community together in pride as they host a one-of-a-kind theatrical
experience, and to encourage patrons to enjoy some of the wonderful things the
Munhall area has to offer, including the impressive architecture and community
programs housed in the Carnegie Library of Munhall, the beautiful park
adjacent, and of course excellent restaurants like Rock Bottom lining The
Waterfront, and much more!</p>
<p>To fully realize the bridge between art and community, the spaces we discovered will be entirely dressed by both local
and visiting artists as art installations, so that as the audience walks
through the space, their senses are engaged not only by the actors, but also by
the music and environment surrounding them. Art installations will be key in
setting the backdrop for the spaces we use.</p>
<p><b>The Pitch</b></p>
<p>We need your help to make this vision a reality. As they say in the show,
“Don’t dream it, be it!” We already have the rights fully paid for by a
generous donor (that’s $2000 already raised!). We have a talented team
assembled. We have the backdrop for our production and our spaces secured. Now
we need to turn several raw, undeveloped spaces into gripping, fully-functional
pieces of our haunted-house-esque puzzle. We have many challenges to overcome,
including rigging sound and lights throughout a traveling show, hiring
top-notch performersand filling out a
production team with excellent crew to ensure that each and every patron has a
safe, memorable, and truly unique experience.</p>

A town that's haunted by an incident at the nearby Scouts centre. Regular swimming lessons come to a halt when a swimming instructor is accused of inappropriately touching a child during a lesson – and the dangers of Facebook creep to the surface.

<h3>The Company</h3>
<p>Arrowwood Theatre Co. is a new theatre company based in Windsor, Ontario. Composed of several University of Windsor students, Arrowwood Theatre Co. aims to create theatre that is challenging, yet accessible to all audiences. With training in many movement techniques, including contact improvisation and Viewpoints technique, the members of Arrowwood are interested in the stories that our bodies can tell and the meaning that is held in the way we touch one another. The company hopes to create theatre that inspires people to look deeper into the everyday and find meaning in every interaction.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This campaign was created in the hopes of generating enough fundraising to make our dream of filling the Al Green Theatre come true! The fundraising from this campaign will go toward creating and devising, lighting and sound engineering, but mainly, towards publicity. The Toronto Fringe scene can be hard to crack for a group of students from Windsor, but we feel that with your help, we can do anything!</p>
<p>We are hoping to raise a minimum of $1,000. As mentioned above, a majority of this money will go towards publicity, but will also support the company by giving us more flexibility in the creating process with lighting and sound design as well as costume design. Our goals for publicity revolve around a low-waste, low-paper consumption model that will allow us to spread the word about our show without spreading waste!</p>
<p>We will be offering some perks for those who are generous enough to contribute financially to this project! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Sponsors are not simply donating money, they are backing ideas and supporting theatre that investigates important questions. They are backing dreams. </p>
<p>This is an ambitious project that we believe will challenge the Canadian theatre scene. As of today, contact improvisation and movement theatre makes up a very small amount of the theatre being produced in Canada. We hope to change this by creating a show that demonstrates how accessible this type of theatre can be to all kinds of audiences. By helping us grow this production, you will be helping us share the beauty of the human body. We want to showcase just how wonderful it is to tell stories through movement and touch and how important it is to move our bodies and reconnect to the animal in all of us.</p>
<p>This show found incredible success in front of Windsor audiences and we hope, with your help, it can reach this same success in Toronto!</p>

<p><strong>GET CLEAN, GET GOD, GET OUT!</strong></p>
<p>Too drunk to live, but too stubborn to die, Ngaire and Naureen are putting their combined 140+ years of experience on men, drinking, race relations, men, religion, drinking, politics, men and drinking on stage, from May 16th at Auckland’s Basement Theatre.</p>
<p>The lovely ladies have been chosen to share their advice at this year's New Zealand International Comedy Festival - but need your help in getting there! It doesn't look like there'll be enough in the Te Awamutu Ladies’ Society kitty to fund the show AND Ngaire's drinking problem, so donate* to support these beauties and New Zealand comedy at its finest!</p>
<p>Talkback radio’s favourite acid-tongued advice-mongers are making the leap from the airwaves to the stage for the most noble of reasons; charity, helping those in society who really can’t, or can’t be bothered, to help themselves. The ladies of Waikeria Prison are the lucky recipients of this advice; advice that’s sometimes hard to hear, but it’s always the truth that hurts most. Ngaire and Naureen pull no punches - unless that huckmole Maisy Smith’s involved. She deserves everything she gets, and that includes a face-full of Ngaire’s fist. Drawing on real life experiences, writer and actor Samuel Christopher and Mark Covich bring the stories of elderly women in rural New Zealand to life in a satirical, dark, hilarious comedy skewering Kiwi culture, celebrity, sex and death..</p>
<p>There are some real goodies up for grabs for our supporters. Who knows? If you donate-for-a-date, you may end up the future honey of one of these darlings. <em></em></p>
<p><em> “The Ngaire &amp; Naureen Helpline Hour is without a doubt the funniest play I have been to in a long time. Samuel Christopher has tapped into a sense of nostalgic kiwiana to create characters that are both endearing and edgy. He walks the line without crossing it, and the results are hilarious.

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">THE PLAY</span></h3>
<p>Spring Awakening is a story about what growth. Over the course of one full year, the play follows a group of young adults as they learn the most personal of lessons: what it means to love and be loved. </p>
<p>A hero for the marginalized,  Wedekind's play darkly and beautifully explores the lives of those who grow up afraid of who they are. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>WHY WE'RE ASKING FOR SUPPORT </strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>The money raised in this campaign will go towards providing production costs for a two-week workshop, and staged reading performance of our adaptation of ""Spring Awakening"", to be read for an invited audience on November 20th.</p>
<p>The purpose of the reading is twofold.</p>
<p>Firstly, our hope is both to showcase the final version of the new script, and garner interest in the future production of the piece. It will also highlight conceptual and staging elements for the play, bought to life by a dynamic design team.</p>
<p>Secondly, we will be using the evening as a way to bring awareness to the need for support for youth in crisis by donating proceeds from the evening to Skylark Children and Family Services--a new agency in Toronto dedicated to bringing accessible support to families and youth in times of need. </p>
<p>Most of the funding for this workshop and its artists has been made possible through generous sponsors. This last push for funding is to ensure the play can be seen as boldly as the artistic team assembled imagines it can be performed in. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>YOUR CONTRIBUTION</h3>
<p>The $3,000.00 being asked for will not be used to pay for artists. Instead, it will be used to fill the rehearsal hall with the materials necessary to bring this vivid new interpretation to life. The items created and developed for this workshop will be used again in final production. </p>
<p>The detailed breakdown of the funding is listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Budget Breakdown:</strong></p>
<p>Set: $800.00-$1000.00</p>

</div></div>","THE PLAY
Spring Awakening is a story about what growth. Over the course of one full year, the play follows a group of young adults as they learn the most personal of lessons: what it means to love and be loved. 
A hero for the marginalized,  Wedekind's play darkly and beautifully explores the lives of those who grow up afraid of who they are. 
 
WHY WE'RE ASKING FOR SUPPORT 

The money raised in this campaign will go towards providing production costs for a two-week workshop, and staged reading performance of our adaptation of ""Spring Awakening"", to be read for an invited audience on November 20th.
The purpose of the reading is twofold.
Firstly, our hope is both to showcase the final version of the new script, and garner interest in the future production of the piece. It will also highlight conceptual and staging elements for the play, bought to life by a dynamic design team.
Secondly, we will be using the evening as a way to bring awareness to the need for support for youth in crisis by donating proceeds from the evening to Skylark Children and Family Services--a new agency in Toronto dedicated to bringing accessible support to families and youth in times of need. 
Most of the funding for this workshop and its artists has been made possible through generous sponsors. This last push for funding is to ensure the play can be seen as boldly as the artistic team assembled imagines it can be performed in. 
 
YOUR CONTRIBUTION
The $3,000.00 being asked for will not be used to pay for artists. Instead, it will be used to fill the rehearsal hall with the materials necessary to bring this vivid new interpretation to life. The items created and developed for this workshop will be used again in final production. 
The detailed breakdown of the funding is listed below.
Budget Breakdown:
Set: $800.00-$1000.00
Costumes: $800.00-$1,000.00
Sound Design/Instrument Rental/Recording: $800.00-$1,000.00

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h3>Our Current Situation</h3><div>Like most dance organizations, we rent space from various dance studios in order to hold our classes.  The problem is, there are limited affordable options for this type of hourly studio rental in Richmond and competition for time slots can be pretty steep. There simply isn't enough consistently available studio time available to meet our needs. What we have right now is a hodgepodge of different locations (and often the inconvenient class times that no one else wants).  </div><div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Add into the mix Kyle &amp; Dave's ongoing search for a new permanent home for their weekly dance, The Jazz Den, and you have a perfect stew of frustration.</span><br/>
</div><div><br/></div><p><span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;background-color: initial;"">What We Need Is Our Own Space.</span><br/></p><div>
<p>We've found a fantastic location for our very own studio, but it will take some upfront investment to fit it out for dancers. We are fortunate to already own a pretty kickin' PA system, but there is a lot more we need to really make this a studio.  Here are just a few of our startup expenses:</p> <ul> <li>
<b>Mirrors.</b> Mirrors are hella expensive, did you know? Installing 30 ft of wall-mounted mirrors will cost us almost $2500.</li>
<li>
<b>Floors.</b> Any swing dancer knows you need a smooth wood floor to really kick it.  We are looking into building our own dance floor, similar to what you might dance on at an event. $3300</li>
<li>
<b>Lights.</b> No one wants to dance under harsh fluorescent bulbs. We'll need to install welcoming, energy-efficient ambient lighting for use during dance socials.  Let Ryan loose in the lamp room at IKEA: $300.</li>
<li>
<b>Fans.</b> Central air is already installed, but we'll need a bit more oomph to help keep you cool. We are looking at some spiffy industrial fans.  $300 (Bonus: you can stand in front of them and pretend to be in an 80's music video. We won't judge you. Wait, no, Kyle will <i>totally </i>judge you.)</li>
<li>
<b>Furniture.</b> We'll need somewhere for you to sit, storage cubbies for your big ol' dance bags, and a front desk for check-in. More fun at IKEA! $500. </li>
<li>
<b>Curtains and fabric.</b> No one wants to be stared at while dancing! We'll need some curtains for the front windows. We'd also like to do some draping on the ceiling to help with acoustics and ambiance. $300</li>
<li>
<b>Miscellaneous.</b> There are lots of other less fun things that cost money: permits, applications, paying a deposit on the space, advertising, taking time off of work, and covering rent &amp; operating expenses while we get the studio ready to go. There will also probably be some surprise expenses along the way, so we've made this a big catch-all category. $3000.</li>
</ul>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
<div>As we near our goal of $10,000, we still have over 3 weeks left in our campaign. We've identified some stretch goals, in the event that we exceed our overall campaign goal.</div>
<div><ul>
<li>
<b>Visiting Instructors </b>- Something we love to do is bring in out of town instructors for small workshops to give perspective and variety to our students.  Because they need to be affordable for students, but involve more costs than a local workshop, such ventures are generally a loss, which is subsidized by our regular class income.  With more income tied up in the studio, we will need to work extra hard to make these small special event workshops a reality. A budget of $500 - $1000 would enable us to subsidize 2 to 3 of these in 2017.</li>
<li>
<b>I *Heart* Balboa</b> - Our big yearly Balboa workshop weekend attracts dancers from all over the country and builds local interest in learning Balboa.  This event gets roughly one third of it's budget from our class income throughout the year.  Since much of this income will now be dedicated to running the studio, there will be  less left over to invest in I *Heart* Balboa. This means we will need to make some alterations to the size and/or format for 2017 unless we can supplement that money.  (For example, to keep the format from 2016, we would need roughly $4500 in additional funds beyond what the event itself brings in). A more modest goal is to adjust our format to two instructor pairs, for which we would only need roughly $2000 of supplemental funds.</li>
</ul></div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>About the Space</h3>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1468969695/lakeside_space_tjtwqd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>(It's bigger on the inside!)</div>
<div>We've located a 750 square foot space in our price range near the Lakeside Farmer's Market. (For reference, that's 150 more square feet than Illumination Studio, which we currently use for several classes, the Sunday Shuffle and all of our Balboa dances).   The other businesses in this building will be closed in the evenings while we are conducting classes, meaning noise should not be an issue. There's tons of parking and there's even a brewery two doors down the street! It's going to be a fantastic location and the visibility may even snag us some new students.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>What You Get (Show Me the Perks!)</h3>
<div>I mean, a swing dance studio existing in Richmond is a pretty cool perk, buuuut we obviously want to give you some other thank-you gifts for helping fund our start-up costs! Here are just some of the things up for grabs:</div>
<ul>
<li>RVA Swing baseball t-shirts </li>
<li>Fuel Dave and Erica's DJ rivalry by choosing a selfie with Terrapin or Reginald Red Panda. May the best mascot win.</li>
<li>Your very own Terrapin Portcullis video</li>
<li>Custom Erica ""Laser Fairy"" Vess PhotoShop Shenanigans</li>
<li>Private lessons with Dave Barry &amp; Kyle Kelley</li>
<li>Famous home-made pizza or ravioli from Ryan Lemar</li>
<li>DJ services from Erica &amp; Dave</li>
<li>Life-time free admission to weekly social dances at the studio</li>
</ul>
<div><b>What happens if we surpass our goal?</b></div>
<div>I'm pretty sure Ryan will eat one of his hats and perhaps a pig will fly. BUT, if something that amazing did happen, we would use the money to get better flooring &amp; mirrors, advertise the studio, upgrade the decor from basic to bangin', and create a budgetary cushion for leaner times. We can also use campaign overages to create a budget for hiring visiting guest instructors!</div>
<div><b>What happens if we don't reach our goal?</b></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">If we don't reach our funding goal, Kyle will cry and Dave will make lawyer-face. But Ryan &amp; Erica will be the most bummed out because that means they will be using their personal savings to fund the shortfall. Obviously, they can only fund a portion of these start-up costs, which is why your support is so important.</span></div>
<div><b>What happens if something falls through?</b></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Again, tears and lawyer face, rude words, and emotional over-eating.  The landlord seems like a really cool dude and is eager to work with us.  Dave has used his magic lawyer pixie dust on all legal documents, and we have already signed the lease for this space, gotten our zoning approved and all that jazz. However, in the event that something unforeseen falls through with this space, we will save the money and  keep looking.  Whatever happens, this money will be used to benefit the Richmond swing dance community and will 100% not send Kyle to Aruba. (For realz, we hid her passport.)</span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><p><b>Wait, what about The Dance Space? Will this affect current dances?</b></p>
<p>We love The Dance Space! It's like our second home.  We don't plan to hold activities that will conflict with the long-running Saturday swing dances there.  Our big goals are more weeknight classes and consistent weeknight social dancing. We want to add to the scene, not subtract from it!<br/></p>
<br/></span></div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>When we are done, local swing dancers will have a dedicated studio that is made just for them! Other benefits of this venture include:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">RVA Swing can offer a full range of class curriculum at a consistent location and at convenient, consolidated times.  Best of all, the RVA Swing team will no longer need to overlap each other's classes. (Score!)</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">We will be able to bring back the Jazz Den and offer mid-week social dancing without the constant uncertainty of venue availability.</span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Our instructors and DJs will always be paid for their work, instead of working on a volunteer basis.<br/></span></li>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> Opening a new business is not without risks and challenges. We understand that this will not be easy. (If it was easy, it would already exist.)

<li>Are you an event organizer who would be willing to donate an event pass that we can use as a perk? Contact us! We will advertise your event like crazy.</li>
<li>Are you a local with a skill or service you could donate as a perk? Contact us!</li> <li>If you're local and handy, we may need assistance with floor installation, painting or other tasks. Come talk to us at a dance.</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm Emma Goldman-Sherman, a playwright, a woman, a survivor, and a parent. I wrote Whorticulture, a confrontational tragicomedy about how girls grow up in our culture today. When I first presented Whorticulture, a woman stood up afterwards and publicly and proudly described herself as a survivor. She said, ""I've never told anyone before today, but this play makes me feel empowered."" People tell me that the play is an eye-opener and an inspiration. Both men and women love this play. Whenever I run into someone who has seen it in development, they want to know when will it get produced. I am trying to get the play into the world because we need this play in the world. It brings people together. It heals. It helps us move forward. </p>
<p>Dixon Place is an amazing space for experimenting with performance. Dixon Place is giving us Friday night, October 20th, on their mainstage to present Whorticulture to its biggest audience yet so we can give everyone a sense of how powerful this play can be. Cynthia Granville is directing! Janet Mervin is creating costumes!  We have 3 amazing actors: Twinke Burke, Teresa Hui and Sarah Kiefer. We want to pay everyone involved. </p>
<p>With many small donations, or large donations, we can rent rehearsal space so we can work on this play; we can make costumes designed by a brilliant female designer; we can provide salaries for the actors (all women) and all the women working on this project, and the man who made this video, and the director; and we can hand-out water at all of the rehearsals, and we can print scripts, and we can probably even make some really cool visuals for the back wall of the stage at Dixon Place. </p>
<p>Theatre is a powerful form of multi-dimensional art that works in time and space to create experience and community in audiences. Women's voices have been underprivileged for so long, we are used to our own silence. I cannot maintain this silence any longer. Please join me in empowering us all with a donation, and if you can't donate financially, share our work on social media. Give us a shout out and let people know that you support women theatre artists who are working to change the world. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We are raising $3K. It goes toward salaries, rehearsal space, costumes, and visuals. </li>
<li>Depending on the level at which you give, you will receive our personal thanks, our social media shout-out thanks, a Worticulture Pen so you can put your own voice into the world, Whorti-Tickets, Whorti-Kisses (your own personal, dramaturgical session with Emma), your own Flower Shower outside the theatre, Producer or Executive Producer credit, our Gratitude, and Whorti-Cult-Status which comes with the knowledge that you took a step to empower women making art to empower women!  </li>
<li>If we don't reach out entire goal, the funds will still go to empower women - this project is slated for Friday night, October 20th, and we will use whatever we raise to make our performance-in-progress a special, once-in-a-lifetime, inspiring, Whorticultural event! </li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>My background and myself:</strong></p>
<p>I truly believe that most people arriving on this page already know most of what makes who I am, but I am more than happy to try to paint a picture here. My name is André Vauthey, I was born and grew up in Switzerland where I graduated from med School and so became a doctor. After some time, I decided to quit/pause to be sure I was in touch with myself first before either continuing or moving on to an other path. Following my instinct I went down the path and tried to become an actor. What I found was much more powerful and truthful: I found myself and with it the artist. I am more than happy to talk more about that face to face :)</p>
<p>Anyway, so here I am today, giving my heart and soul into life and doing projects I love. One of them being this one: The Nina Variations. This is going to be the sixth play I would be performing in. In the same world but on a different optic, I direct theater as well (I have directed so far three plays in NYC and am currently working on my fourth).</p>
<p>I think that gives you some ideas of whom I might be. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why is this important to me:</strong></p>
<p>I guess, if you felt my being in the paragraph prior to this, you would already know why this is important to me :) Life and truth is all that matters to me and the theater is a place where those two collide and are sacred. I will give my heart, soul and bones to it, but, if you can help me, in one way or the other for me not to have to do that completely, I would truly appreciate as I would love this project not to be my last one :)</p>

<p>What we need?</p>
<p>Money, of course, but not only and not particularly. Some love, for sure, there is plenty to give and to receive. More pragmatically?

One other great thing would be if anyone knows anyone who could come and write something about us; that would be amazing!</p>
<p>What you get?</p>
<p> No money :) but again, love of course. And anything you feel you want. We will have official perks (sign fotos, free tickets, etc) but if you feel like you would like to donate but don’t like the perks, feel free to shoot me a text and see what we can find. Or if you feel like donating and don’t need anything, that’s beautiful too.</p>

<p>We seek to raise a flexible goal of $2500, to help us cover the last production expenses, such as allowing extra rehearsing time and stipend to cast and crew and finishing the set.</p>
<p>Every dollar helps in the founding of this project, and is greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>If you donate $15 or more, you will receive a poster signed from the actors, if you donate $1500 or more you’ll receive a producer credit.</p>

<h3>World Premier of <i>The Terrible Legend of Victoria Woodhull</i>
</h3>
<p>Why are we participating in the 18th Hollywood Fringe Festival, and why this story:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ashley has been a professional actress for over a decade, but she has never had the opportunity to perform in a one-woman show.  </li>
<li>Theo has been writing and producing theater off and on for almost a decade, but he has never taken on the challenge of writing a show for a single performer. </li>
<li>Karen directed repertory theater during her days in Nashville before moving to LA to pursue film. Her films have been shown in festivals across the country, but she's been longing for the raw power of theater which drew her to this project. </li>
<li>With our combined enthusiasm for the subject matter, and our artistic aesthetic which believes theater should both be simple and have larger social ramifications, we are incredibly excited to bring this show into the world. One could argue that Victoria Woodhull is of greater importance than Susan B. Anthony with regards to the modern fights for equality that women are still facing, and we believe by pushing her name into the cultural limelight we can inspire more people to learn about her and become activists for this cause.  </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>While many venues offer discounted rates to facilitate Fringe Shows, we still need to pay for basic things like renting the space, getting insurance for the performances, rehearsal space, money for our tech stage manager, and finally a costume and some basic props. </li>
<li>We firmly believe we can make this show simple and powerful without too many bells and whistles, so we are not looking for excess money - just enough to cover the necessities.</li>
<li>We are offering discounted seats for donations, and if you happen to have the monies and are feeling especially generous we also have some fun perks including signed scripts, recited poetry, and even the actress and writer cooking you a full 3-course dinner. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We hope this play will both cast a light on Victoria Woodhull's amazing life and her brazen and incredibly activism during a time when women were meant to be bound to their husbands and confined to their homes. In the light of the recent #MeToo movement it's obvious that equality for women still has a LONG way to go, and by giving a public audience a more comprehensive look at this past champion of women, we hope it will give insight and hope as our society continues to push forward. </p>
<p>Both Ashley and Theo have run their own off-Broadway theater production companies and have had successful runs of a number of shows. They are committed to making theater as affordable and enjoyable as possible, and given their track records they know how to put together a savvy and reasonable budget. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We are not embarking upon this production with the hopes of great financial gain. What we aspire to is to fill the seats of the Hob Goblin Theater for what may be the last set of performances ever done there before the city of LA re-purposes it. </p>
<p>The more people we reach, the more people who donate, will translate to a bigger audience to listen to this funny, dramatic, and comprehensive (slightly fictional) look at Victoria's incredible life. We are committed fully to this story and want to share it with as many people as we can. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you can't contribute, please consider joining us for one of our five performances: </p>
<p>6/3, 6/10, 6/13, 6/16, 6/19</p>
<p>And, we not so humbly ask that you share this with as many people as you can. People who might donate, who might see the show, who might be willing to contribute goods or services we can use to help raise our necessary funds. </p>
<p>It takes a village to put on a theater show, even if it's just a single performer, and we greatly value our community of fellow artists and patrons who still believe in the value of live story telling. </p>

<p>Squeaky Bicycle is back with another innovative, thought-provoking, and gutsy production: the world premiere of resident playwright Dylan Lamb's dark comedy <i>Ten Ways On A Gun</i>!</p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Squeaky Bicycle has been working with Lamb for over a year to develop this new piece that tackles topics at the forefront of social discussion with care and humor. Through our Reading Lab and subsequent workshopping of the piece, it’s only gotten better and braver.</span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><span>So, What is This Play, Anyway?</span></h3>
<p>Tommy bought a gun. It didn’t end well. </p>
<p>Jessica devised a play about it. It didn’t end very well, either. </p>
<p><i>Ten Ways on a Gun</i> is Tommy’s story, Jessica’s story, and how each changes the other. It’s an exploration of many things - Love, control, capitalism, existential crises, loneliness, art, mental illness, the pressures of life as a young adult in New York. Most of all, though, it’s an exploration of how American gun culture has profoundly affected each of these concepts. Dylan Lamb has written a heartfelt, insightful, and in many ways universal story, told through the humorous lens that makes his work truly special. The result is a comedy about a drama about a tragedy that will leave you laughing, feeling, and thinking. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Every
day, the conversation about gun control becomes more urgent. As our nation
grapples with the realities of our existing gun culture, as the statistics become
more and more alarming, we feel compelled to take part in the conversation the
best way we know how. This production is how we give a human face to
those statistics, and to encourage our society to approach the issue in a
different way. </p>
<p><b>With <i>Ten Ways on a Gun, </i>we
add our voices to the millions across the country asking for change, and we
hope you’ll help make our voices heard with a tax-deductible donation.</b></p>

<p><i> “<i>Ten Ways on a Gun</i> deftly deals with our cultural baggage regarding guns, gun ownership and the tools we use to feel in control of our lives.” </i></p>
<p><i>– <a href=""http://charged.fm/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">charged.fm</a></i></p>
<p><i>“The ensemble of the piece had ease with the author’s words. Lamb himself plays Tommy Freely, and his last scene will send chills down your spine. The rest of the cast was dynamic…The set design by Kathryn Lieber gave the show its heart, and director Kathryn McConell did a great job exposing its soul. But at the end, this is Dylan Lamb’s show, and it will be a name I remember.” </i></p>

<p>The 2013 production of <i>Alligator Summer</i> proved that Squeaky Bicycle and Dylan Lamb are a theatrical dream team. But don’t take our word for it, check out what the critics had to say: </p>
<blockquote>“Dylan Lamb can write. From the first lines, you're struck by the very unique way his characters talk, and how distinctive each of them are. In this talent, I don't think comparisons to the Coen Brothers and Christopher Durang are out of place. ... I will certainly be on the lookout for more from Lamb and Squeaky Bicycle Productions.” </blockquote>
<blockquote>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">-Matt Roberson, nytheatre.com<br/></span><span style=""color: rgb(119, 119, 119); background-color: initial;""><br/>“It’s a rare amalgam of first rate work from all artists involved. … Dylan Lamb is a playwright of extraordinary talent, and will undoubtedly be widely recognized in time. He never dwells on a moment, never skims over it; each dramatic element is given the weight it needs to balance the whole. … We’d like to see more from Lamb as soon as possible.” </span>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<span style=""color: rgb(119, 119, 119); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">-Steve Capra<br/></span>
</blockquote>

Squeaky Bicycle is back with another innovative, thought-provoking, and gutsy production: the world premiere of resident playwright Dylan Lamb's dark comedy Ten Ways On A Gun!

Squeaky Bicycle has been working with Lamb for over a year to develop this new piece that tackles topics at the forefront of social discussion with care and humor. Through our Reading Lab and subsequent workshopping of the piece, it’s only gotten better and braver.


So, What is This Play, Anyway?
Tommy bought a gun. It didn’t end well. 
Jessica devised a play about it. It didn’t end very well, either. 
Ten Ways on a Gun is Tommy’s story, Jessica’s story, and how each changes the other. It’s an exploration of many things - Love, control, capitalism, existential crises, loneliness, art, mental illness, the pressures of life as a young adult in New York. Most of all, though, it’s an exploration of how American gun culture has profoundly affected each of these concepts. Dylan Lamb has written a heartfelt, insightful, and in many ways universal story, told through the humorous lens that makes his work truly special. The result is a comedy about a drama about a tragedy that will leave you laughing, feeling, and thinking. 

Every
day, the conversation about gun control becomes more urgent. As our nation
grapples with the realities of our existing gun culture, as the statistics become
more and more alarming, we feel compelled to take part in the conversation the
best way we know how. This production is how we give a human face to
those statistics, and to encourage our society to approach the issue in a
different way. 
With Ten Ways on a Gun, we
add our voices to the millions across the country asking for change, and we
hope you’ll help make our voices heard with a tax-deductible donation.

Early Praise for Ten Ways on a Gun

 “Ten Ways on a Gun deftly deals with our cultural baggage regarding guns, gun ownership and the tools we use to feel in control of our lives.” 
– charged.fm
“The ensemble of the piece had ease with the author’s words. Lamb himself plays Tommy Freely, and his last scene will send chills down your spine. The rest of the cast was dynamic…The set design by Kathryn Lieber gave the show its heart, and director Kathryn McConell did a great job exposing its soul. But at the end, this is Dylan Lamb’s show, and it will be a name I remember.” 
– Nelson Diaz-Marcano, Manhattan with a Twist
“The show works as a commentary on both the versatility and power of theatrical storytelling: here that power and versatility is turned on American obsession with guns.” 
– Artem Yatsunov, theasy.com
“A show with a great mixture of humor,
baudiness, and none of the “Afterschool Special” preachiness so common with
plays that deal with controversial subject matter.” 
– Monica Trombley,
Woman Around Town

“The ensemble gels well together – uniformly sharp,
comically dark, and at times outrageous, especially during blitzkrieg
choreography.” 
– Sarah Matusek, New York Theatre Review

“Dylan Lamb has a knack for comedic writing. It's where he's
at his finest.” 
– Theater in the Now

“Squeaky Bicycle’s collective creativity demonstrates
something undeniably bold and ambitious.” 
– Sarah Matusek, New York Theatre Review

“Ten Ways on a Gun tackles
the timely subject of this country’s relationship with guns and violence,
placing us in the heart of the constant debate.” 
– Inna Tsyrlin, StageBuddy
“A testament to society’s ability to momentarily cede its
fixation on the inconsequential and turn a studious eye on a sensitive, and
highly divisive, subject matter.” 
– Willie Keaton, My Entertainment World






Squeaky Bike & Dylan Lamb: 
Reunited and it Feels So Good
The 2013 production of Alligator Summer proved that Squeaky Bicycle and Dylan Lamb are a theatrical dream team. But don’t take our word for it, check out what the critics had to say: 
“Dylan Lamb can write. From the first lines, you're struck by the very unique way his characters talk, and how distinctive each of them are. In this talent, I don't think comparisons to the Coen Brothers and Christopher Durang are out of place. ... I will certainly be on the lookout for more from Lamb and Squeaky Bicycle Productions.” 

-Matt Roberson, nytheatre.com“It’s a rare amalgam of first rate work from all artists involved. … Dylan Lamb is a playwright of extraordinary talent, and will undoubtedly be widely recognized in time. He never dwells on a moment, never skims over it; each dramatic element is given the weight it needs to balance the whole. … We’d like to see more from Lamb as soon as possible.” 


-Steve Capra


“Lamb’s words are in turn delicious and hilarious; he crafts an astute play with numerous moments of poignancy and hilarity. I was completely impressed by the caliber of the performances, the production, and the script.” 
- Joseph Samuel Wright, Theatre Is Easy
I was completely blown away by both the show and the performers. One of the best shows I have seen in years."" 
- New York Times reader review

""If you really like some content to chew on, this play raises issues ripe for serious, long discussions afterward."" 
- TheaterMania reader review

   You Know We’re Good For It 
We think the message of this play needs to be heard and we’re doing as so much to make that happen. True to form, Squeaky Bicycle Productions is doing some new and exciting things; new things like a big hip downtown location (Theater for the New City) with our biggest audience capacity to date, our largest cast, and a massive new marketing effort to cast a wider net than ever before. Plus, with the performances of 10 incredible actors and the work of passionate designers and creative personnel, Ten Ways on a Gun is already the biggest production in Squeaky Bicycle history! 
The quality is easy to see long before you get to the theater: Playwright Dylan Lamb is a recipient of the Chair’s Award of Excellence in Dramatic Writing at NYU and a current member of Fresh Ground Pepper’s PlayGround PlayGroup. He and/or his work have previously been seen at the Edinburgh Fringe, Minnesota Fringe, 45 Bleecker Street, SoHo Rep Walkerspace, The Cherry Pit, EST/Youngblood, The Tank, The Gene Frankel Theater, and Horse Trade Theater. With Ten Ways on a Gun, he's delivering an outstanding play years in the making. It's been workshopped in Fresh Ground Pepper’s PlayGround and Squeaky Bicycle’s own annual Reading Lab Series - the latter of which has been the starting place for five years of successful productions.
Now in its 5th season, Squeaky Bicycle has achieved a reputation for bringing you rich, intelligent plays in high-quality productions. Find us at www.squeakybicycleproductions.com.

excited!</b> Encuentro will take place at the famous Los Angeles Theater Center
from October 12<sup>th</sup> to November 10<sup>th</sup>, during which we will perform
the play 15 times. This production marks two major <i>firsts</i> for Caborca: our first time traveling with our work, and the
first time either part of <i>Zoetrope</i>
will receive more than 2 showings. <b>It is a huge moment for the company!</b></p>
<p>But…</p>
<p>Traveling with a show is not cheap. Encuentro is flying us,
housing us, feeding us, and paying a fee that covers some of our production
costs, but the rest of our costs – primarily our artist salaries – are up to us.
All members of the company (10 people) are taking a month off from work to
travel to LA, and our designers are all coming for a week. While we are there, not only will we be performing <i>Zoetrope: Part 1</i>, but we will also be working on our days off with other festival participants to devise new performances to be presented at the end, engaging fully in Encuentro as guest artists. In order to make all of
this possible, we need to raise $15,000. </p>
<p>And that’s where you come in. For those who saw the
workshops of either part of <i>Zoetrope</i>
at Pregones, we think you’d agree it is big step forward for Caborca, bringing
together many of the elements we’ve been working with and refining for years.
For those who didn’t but know our work, <i>Zoetrope</i>
is a play of which we’re enormously proud and we hope to show it to you soon so you’ll see why. Traveling to LA for Encuentro will expose this play to
a whole new audience as well as give it the momentum it needs to come back home

<h2>Who We Are</h2>
<p>Caborca is a New York based experimental theatre company
working in two languages and multiple boroughs. We include (in occasionally overlapping combinations) a
playwright/director, designer, a handful of actors, and two stage managers. Over
15 years, we have amassed members from the University of Puerto Rico, Columbia
University, and beyond, though we were officially founded as a company in 2009.
Our previous works include <b><i>Barceloneta,
de noche</i></b> and <b><i>FLORIDITA, my Love</i></b>,
both performed at IATI and LATEA Theatres, <b><i>El
correo de la noche</i></b>, our international collaboration with Colombian director
Eloisa Jaramillo, performed at IRT Theatre, and 2012’s immersive warehouse
production of <b><i>Open up, Hadrian</i></b>,
written by our Artistic Director, Javier Antonio González, and directed by
Meiyin Wang at Magic Futurebox, which <i>Time Out</i> gave four stars and called
“opulent” and “delightful.” Since <i>Hadrian</i>,
we have been hard at work on various projects, including a reading series of
our play <b>THE FUTURE OF BOOKS</b>, an original <b>writers' workshop</b>, and most
importantly, two fully produced showings as part of the Artist Space at
Pregones residency of <b><i>Zoetrope: Parts 1 </i>and<i> 2</i></b>, our next original play written and
directed by González. The two years since <i>Hadrian
</i>have also brought us five wonderful new members (except for Laura who’s ok).
Caborca’s aesthetic influences and collaborators run the gamut between Latin
American, Asian, European, and New York experimental traditions.</p>
<p>Caborca is: <b>Michael Barringer, Brooke Bell, Laura Butler
Rivera, Yaremis Félix, Javier Antonio González, Erin Koster, Jian Jung, Tania
Molina, Pedro Leopoldo Sánchez-Tormes, Veraalba Santa, David Skeist, </b>and<b> Marcos
Toledo.</b></p>
<h2>What You Get</h2>
<ul>
<li>A multitude of creative and less creative perks including
company art projects (an original zoetrope, anyone?), swag, and a very exclusive invitation.
You might also get some postcards and pictures and all the pretty things.</li>
<li>An enormous amount of gratitude.</li>
<li>
<b>But perhaps more than all of that, you will have the
knowledge that you are helping a group of artists who have been working
extremely hard for years realize one of their dreams. </b>You will also be helping Caborca take a major part in the most significant artistic interchange among members
of the US Latino Theatre community in decades. </li>
</ul><h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Spread the word</b> like lice in a kindergarten:</li>
<li>
<b>Post and repost</b> (and compost if you’re into that kind of
thing)</li>
<li><b>Tweet</b></li>
<li>
<b>Shout about us</b> from the hills (or at least the heights:
Washington, Crown, Brooklyn, whatever)</li>
<li>
<b>Know anyone in LA?</b> We don’t. Make a match and we’ll send you
pictures from our honeymoon.</li>
<li>
<b>Rack your brain</b> and your contact list for anyone who might
want to support independent, experimental theatre at a Latino festival
(remember Aunt Rita who married that Mexican circus performer in the 70’s)?</li>
<li>
<b>Wear a Caborca T-Shirt.</b> That you can buy. With your money.
Email us to find out how (caborca.theatre@gmail.com).</li>
</ul><h2>About the Play</h2>
<p><i>Zoetrope</i> tells the story of an underdog military postal
officer with a dream. Until he dies. Then it tells the story of his ex-wife,
her sister, his lover, her friend, his son, the playwright René Marqués, and el
Grito de Lares. <br/></p><p>That's the tantalizing blurb for the uninitiated. Here's a little more of a description: Inés and Francisca (don't call her Panchi) teach English in Lares, their small town in the mountains of Puerto Rico. Together with their best friend Celeste, they talk about the island's existential quagmire. A lot. Inés wears dresses. Francisca wears pants. Some of them fall in love. In
New York, time is running out on Inés's husband, Severino, who is dying in the arms of
another woman. In Lares, time seems to stand still even as the women plan for a revolution. 
<br/></p><p><b>This production of <i>Zoetrope:
Part 1</i> will include at least several supertitled bilingual performances with the scenes
that take place in Lares in Spanish and those in New York, in English.</b></p>
<p><i>Zoetrope: Parts 1 </i>and<i> 2</i> were developed at Pregones Theater as part of Artist Space
at Pregones.</p>
<h4>That’s our pitch. We love you all. Please help us if you
can. Truly any amount helps. Like, seriously any. Seriously.</h4>

Pregones residency of Zoetrope: Parts 1 and 2, our next original play written and
directed by González. The two years since Hadrian
have also brought us five wonderful new members (except for Laura who’s ok).
Caborca’s aesthetic influences and collaborators run the gamut between Latin
American, Asian, European, and New York experimental traditions.
Caborca is: Michael Barringer, Brooke Bell, Laura Butler
Rivera, Yaremis Félix, Javier Antonio González, Erin Koster, Jian Jung, Tania
Molina, Pedro Leopoldo Sánchez-Tormes, Veraalba Santa, David Skeist, and Marcos
Toledo.
What You Get

A multitude of creative and less creative perks including
company art projects (an original zoetrope, anyone?), swag, and a very exclusive invitation.
You might also get some postcards and pictures and all the pretty things.
An enormous amount of gratitude.

But perhaps more than all of that, you will have the
knowledge that you are helping a group of artists who have been working
extremely hard for years realize one of their dreams. You will also be helping Caborca take a major part in the most significant artistic interchange among members
of the US Latino Theatre community in decades. 
Other Ways You Can Help


Spread the word like lice in a kindergarten:

Post and repost (and compost if you’re into that kind of
thing)
Tweet

Shout about us from the hills (or at least the heights:
Washington, Crown, Brooklyn, whatever)

Know anyone in LA? We don’t. Make a match and we’ll send you
pictures from our honeymoon.

Rack your brain and your contact list for anyone who might
want to support independent, experimental theatre at a Latino festival
(remember Aunt Rita who married that Mexican circus performer in the 70’s)?

Wear a Caborca T-Shirt. That you can buy. With your money.
Email us to find out how (caborca.theatre@gmail.com).
About the Play
Zoetrope tells the story of an underdog military postal
officer with a dream. Until he dies. Then it tells the story of his ex-wife,
her sister, his lover, her friend, his son, the playwright René Marqués, and el
Grito de Lares. That's the tantalizing blurb for the uninitiated. Here's a little more of a description: Inés and Francisca (don't call her Panchi) teach English in Lares, their small town in the mountains of Puerto Rico. Together with their best friend Celeste, they talk about the island's existential quagmire. A lot. Inés wears dresses. Francisca wears pants. Some of them fall in love. In
New York, time is running out on Inés's husband, Severino, who is dying in the arms of
another woman. In Lares, time seems to stand still even as the women plan for a revolution. 
This production of Zoetrope:
Part 1 will include at least several supertitled bilingual performances with the scenes
that take place in Lares in Spanish and those in New York, in English.
Zoetrope: Parts 1 and 2 were developed at Pregones Theater as part of Artist Space
at Pregones.
That’s our pitch. We love you all. Please help us if you
can. Truly any amount helps. Like, seriously any. Seriously.
Besos y abrazos,

<p><b>February - Boston Marriage, by David Mamet,
directed by Angeli Primlani</b></p>
<p>Our company has a passion for language-based plays that the
western classical canon just cannot contain. So this year, I am directing
Boston Marriage, a relatively underperformed David Mamet play about a 19th
century Lesbian couple and how they struggle with economic security,
infidelity, the threat of prison, and their incredibly flawed natures. </p>
<p>Anna and Claire have been lovers for years, when Anna
becomes the mistress of a wealthy man in order to support them both. But of
course it is nowhere near that simple. What does fidelity mean when one's romantic
partnership can barely be imagined as real? Does money distort women's sexual
and personal integrity? Is chintz a sign of love or a form of psychological
torture? Must we always hurt the ones we love? And what about ... the maid? </p>
<p>This is our first foray as a company into performing a play
by a living playwright, but it won't be the last. We're excited about applying
our classical skill-set to a contemporary play. </p>

<h3>THE PLAY</h3>
<p>Sperm donation can happen with a magazine and a cup, but for people attempting to donate their eggs, things are not so easy. Through awkward moments, hormonal daydreams, dance parties, and the not-fun-kind-of-shots, over easy follows four egg donors from recruitment to extraction.</p>
<p>OVER EASY has been developed with the support of SheNYC Arts, NoMads Art Collective, Theatre Aspen, Theatre of the Beyond, and Montclair State University. The play would not exist without the creative support of the many artists who have supported its development. This will be the first fully-staged production of the play! </p>
<h3>THE FESTIVAL</h3>
<p>July 27-August 8, 2021</p>
<p>The SheNYC Summer Theatre Festival is dedicated to showcasing the new, original works of women writers, composers, &amp; directors. </p>
<p>SheNYC is a group of theater professionals showcasing the talents of writers, composers, producers, directors, and other theater artists who are part of a marginalized gender group, including cis women, trans, and non-binary people. Our mission is to prove that there is no reason for male artists to have the overwhelming majority of produced work in New York City. We provide artists with the resources they need on their path to leadership roles in the industry. </p>

THE PLAY
Sperm donation can happen with a magazine and a cup, but for people attempting to donate their eggs, things are not so easy. Through awkward moments, hormonal daydreams, dance parties, and the not-fun-kind-of-shots, over easy follows four egg donors from recruitment to extraction.
OVER EASY has been developed with the support of SheNYC Arts, NoMads Art Collective, Theatre Aspen, Theatre of the Beyond, and Montclair State University. The play would not exist without the creative support of the many artists who have supported its development. This will be the first fully-staged production of the play! 
THE FESTIVAL
July 27-August 8, 2021
The SheNYC Summer Theatre Festival is dedicated to showcasing the new, original works of women writers, composers, & directors.

We provide artists with the resources they need on their path to leadership roles in the industry.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><i>Wearing Black</i> is a deeply personal piece.</p>
<p>I wrote it not because I crave fame, fortune, or career advancement, but because I need to share the story. I'm trying to make the world a little better through art and that's why <i>Wearing Black</i> was born.</p>

<p><strong>What is an ""Industry Reading"" anyway?</strong><br/>We present the show in full to invited industry professionals to establish the team that will ultimately bring the show to the public at large.

<p>FUNDRAISING SUCKS - Everyone hates to be asked for money. I hate to ask.</p>
<p>But too bad, I need it.</p>
<p>In order to smash this reading out of the park, I need a lot of things that cost money:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creative team - director/MD/GM etc.</li>
<li>Broadway actors</li>
<li>Broadway musicians</li>
<li>Rehearsal/performance space</li>
<li>Marketing</li>
<li>Hard goods - scripts, props, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>...the list goes on an on. This pitch is already quite lengthy and if you've made it this far then you get 10 points.</p>
<p>This industry does not do enough to foster new voices, nor is it designed to mitigate the costs to passionate storytellers. I have to ask for financial help or it can't happen. Is it selfish? I go back and forth. Yes, I'm doing this because it's my passion to tell stories. But over the course of my career my work has provided literally HUNDREDS of jobs for artists. My work has inspired and helped people, made them laugh, made them cry, made them see or face a part of themselves that they wouldn't have been able to otherwise. And that's why I do it - to help people. As cliche as that sounds.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your donation is a part of the vibrant culture of New York City. You become an integral part of the creative process when you financially support the arts. With <i>Wearing Black </i>in particular, you help bring a healing entertainment venture about death, addiction and self-destruction to people who might desperately need to hear it.</p>
<p>How many of us have a specific piece of art that has truly influenced our lives for the better? A song, a movie, a book - anything? I'm not saying that <i>Wearing Black</i> is that for everybody, but hopefully it is for somebody. That's why it exists. That's my job. Help me do it.</p>

The work that has been produced since 1947 until today carries deep anarchist and pacifist messages, involves audience participation and creates an interactive spectacle to create a collective theatrical experience rather than the traditional separation between the performers and the audience. </p>Because of the company's extensive history and major contribution to the world of experimental performance, TLT is committed to showing the citizens of Black Rock that The Living and its ideals are not a thing of the past, but instead are alive and well and are relevant now more than ever to the world in which we exist. We are looking to make human connections, perform regularly, expand our networks, discuss the state of the arts today and introduce Judith and TLT to different generations of activists, organizers, artists, innovators and beings who are also actively working towards the Revolution. <p></p><p><b>CAMP:</b></p><p><b>Our camp design is complete! </b>The placement of our camp/theatre at Burning Man has also been finalized! We will be at 6 o’clock right by the Center Camp, as seen below.

<p></p></div>","TITLE:Burning the LivingSHORT DESCRIPTION:The Living Theatre, the oldest experimental theatre company in the US, will forge into the desert to directly address the topic of maintaining artistic space in a society that presents constant obstacles for anyone who cannot afford outrageous rent increases and are driven out of neighborhoods by the ever-growing epidemic of gentrification.  The Living will build a multi-orientational fully outfitted theatre that will host an 8 day revolutionary theatre festival centering around interactive performance, collective discussions, workshops, live music, screenings, installations, etc. Resident performers aside from The Living include Bad Unkl Sista, Perf Productions, WalkUpArts, Raindear and others. The entire project will be the subject of a feature documentary, chronicling the the journey of The Living Theatre ensemble from New York City into the temporary community of Black Rock City, Nevada. Our company deeply values the melding of both our past and our present in the creative process and we are so fortunate with this endeavor, to bring veteran members and younger, newer company members to the Playa, and collaborate with many TLT family members who regularly attend the festival.  We are all very excited to discuss, collaborate and celebrate the genesis and exchange of Art with all in the Burner community.Your donation will not only contribute to this historical and epic production, but also to help announce the regeneration of a dynamic new era for our company.  SHORT SUMMARY:We are The Living Theatre. Since 1947, The Living has been committed to using theatre as a powerful way to transform and transcend the boundaries of performance and draw attention to important social and political issues affecting communities both domestically and internationally.  From its conception, The Living Theatre was dedicated to transforming the organization of power within society from a competitive, hierarchical structure to cooperative and communal expression. The work that has been produced since 1947 until today carries deep anarchist and pacifist messages, involves audience participation and creates an interactive spectacle to create a collective theatrical experience rather than the traditional separation between the performers and the audience. Because of the company's extensive history and major contribution to the world of experimental performance, TLT is committed to showing the citizens of Black Rock that The Living and its ideals are not a thing of the past, but instead are alive and well and are relevant now more than ever to the world in which we exist. We are looking to make human connections, perform regularly, expand our networks, discuss the state of the arts today and introduce Judith and TLT to different generations of activists, organizers, artists, innovators and beings who are also actively working towards the Revolution. CAMP:Our camp design is complete! The placement of our camp/theatre at Burning Man has also been finalized! We will be at 6 o’clock right by the Center Camp, as seen below. This placement is fantastic, and will allow us to reach out to a broad range of people and allow us to help facilitate the free exchange of performance on a broader level. BUDGET:After many budget meetings we concluded that our goal for this campaign is $36,000.  Theatre Structure:                                                             $ 3,500.00Camp Structure:                                                                $ 2,000.00 Tech/Power:                                                                       $ 2,300.00Bio-Diesel Gas (Price Per Gallon):                                 $ 4.89Equipment (Lighting & Sound)                                      $ 6,000.00Truck Rental (incl. early festival arrival)                      $ 1425.00Truck Mileage:                                                                   $ 720.00    Transportation for elderly TLT members:                   $4,000.00Transportation for Core Crew Members (12):             $ 4,800.00Tickets for 11 Core Members:                                         $ 2,090.00RV Rental for Production/Elderly:                                 $ 3,237.00Supplies:                                                                              $ 230.00Food:                                                                                     $ 2,000.00Water:                                                                                   $ 800.00First Aid:                                                                               $ 150.00Camping Supplies:                                                             $ 300.00Emergency Petty Cash:                                                     $ 2,000.00TOTAL:                                                                                  $ 35,556.89TOTAL INDIEGOGO GOAL:                                              $ 39,999.00Any money over the goal will go directly into future productions of No Place to Hide in NYC and into the company.  No one will be paid for this project.We are viewing this campaign and project as an investment in our future as a company.

<p>Thanks for stopping by our campaign page. With your help, we hope to make the June production of <em>Ye Elizabeths</em> a truly special experience, which will hopefully bring smiles to the faces and songs to the hearts of our audience members.  </p>
<p>Here's a little background on the project and our process:</p>
<p>After improvising together for years with ComedySportz New York and Slapstick Picnic, supporting one another in individual acting pursuits, and even co-starring in a National Radio Commercial, it felt right to start collaborating on some of our writing ideas.  Over the past year through research, improvised inspired writing, late-night musical collaborations and lots of laughter, we developed a story which explores themes of friendship and the ever-changing American Dream and how one might approach the achieving of that dream, even if it means choosing to make enemies along the way.</p>
<p><em>Ye Elizabeths</em> is a multi-media comedy show, profiling the foibles of two flawed and sheltered historical re-enactors, living and working on a low-rent version of Plimoth Plantation.  When their living history museum goes the way of the buffalo, the girls are forced back into the 21st Century.  With their friendship tested and their dreams on the line they must find a way to marry their Pilgrim lives to these modern times. And, what better way to do that than Reality TV.</p>
<p>Through the writing of <em>Ye Elizabeths</em> and now in its rehearsal and performance, we've gotten to work with wonderful artists who are also great friends.  Here's the team:</p>

<p>We've also called upon some of our favorite people, who have been generous enough to lend us their voices/images and time, through their participation is some of the video/audio elements of the play: Jeremy Banks, Ryan Young, Sabrina Farhi, Tim Ruggeri, Lindsey Sproul, Jeff Sproul, and Zachary Gilman.  We cannot thank them enough and are so excited to show audiences their work!<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>All we need now is a little help from you to defer a portion of the costs of rehearsal space, set pieces &amp; publicity materials, insurance and compensation for our team.  And, we're pretty sure your generosity will be tax deductible (pretty sure).    At the very least, it will give you tons of cool points, and please keep clicking through for our awesome thank you gifts!</strong></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey Family and Friends, My name is Danielle Smart and I am currently a senior Professional Theatre Student at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University. In this last semester I was granted the opportunity to study theatre abroad in West Africa at the University of Ghana. My studies in Ghana will focus on the art forms of the motherland as well as advance my knowledge of distinct cultural differences that enable storytelling specific to pan Africanism.</p>
<p>This campaign is being set forth to cover my flight to Accra, Ghana. The cheapest ticket I've been able to find is $1650. Thankfully, I was awarded a grant for $1500 but it wont cover my whole flight after purchasing a visa, traveler's health insurance, and vaccines. The $10 you contribute will be a great assistance in my arrival at the University in time!  </p>
<p>Theatre has been a passion of mine for as long as I can remember, as a theatre student we are often taught acting methods of Europeans and some Asians but rarely any African art forms. I am looking forward to studying and experiencing theatre and dance from a West African point of view and to bridge the artistic gap between African and American cultures. </p>
<p>With your help I know i can raise these funds in time so that I will be able to study abroad. I understand that not everyone can contribute financially, but if you can, please forward this link to anyone that you know who might be interested in my campaign. THANK YOU so much!! Please help me to broaden my horizons and raise awareness of different cultures!</p>

This season, The New American Theatre received over 1400 plays from American playwrights
searching for a venue to tell their stories. This challenged us to GO BIG! The selection was awe-inspiring and we're very excited to announce this ambitious
summer festival of new works. We're calling it The New American Theatre Project. This summer, we'll present:
12 new one-act plays performed by
members of our professional company
Staged readings of 2 brand new full-length plays (63 Trillion by John Bunzel, and Hookman by Lauren Yee).

2 nights of scenes from some of the best plays around to showcase
the talents of our ensemble members.
Fall 2014
Then, in the Fall, in honor of his 450th birthday, we'll present Shakespeare's Othello, as well as two American classics, starring our company of seasoned and emerging actors.About The New American TheatreThe New American Theatre is an award-winning non-profit theatre company 
based in Los Angeles. An artist-lead company of professional stage, film and TV actors, we've produced over 55 full-length productions and over 90 original one act plays in our short history.  We've enjoyed critical acclaim, awards and 
nominations from the Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle, The New York Times, Variety, The Hollywood Reporter, Back 
Stage West, LA Weekly, LA Stage Alliance Ovations, and more. CBS Los 
Angeles named The New American Theatre as one of the top five  99-seat 
theatre companies in Los Angeles.  Our professional actor training program helps actors stay focused and working on their art and career.  Click here to go to our websiteHere's a short video that shows some of our work throughout the years:Why We Need Your Help
Even with all of our success, ticket sales only make up a portion of our funding. As a non-profit company, we need support from kind folks like you to help us keep our doors open and fund our projects.  We are asking for $7000 but this really only covers a portion of our budget for the project and certainly for our season. Your contribution will help lesson the overall production costs and help us pay for theatre rental, rehearsal space, stage manager, actors fees, publicity, programs, fees, and more.Other Ways You Can HelpPlease come see our shows and support theatre!

The play provides an entirely new perspective and understanding of Picasso, his art, and inspirations to those who might be unaware of the intricate, delicate, and often times complicated inner workings of his personal life.

<p>*Classics in Color: An INclusive Theatre Company is a sponsored project of Fractured Atlas, a non-profit arts service organization. Contributions for the charitable purposes of Classics in Color must be made payable to Fractured Atlas only and are tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law.*</p>
<p>My name is Nafeesa Monroe and I'm the founder and artistic director of Classics in Color: An INclusive Theatre Company. Our mission is about inclusivity, not just on stage but off, in ethnicity, in gender, and in physical able-ness. We want the world to see themselves in our productions of classic and classical works. Through our work we hope to demystify the classics and create accessible theatre to which we all can relate. We want all people to be able to see a version of themselves on stage, to feel included. We are bringing Shakespeare and the classics back to the people.</p>
<p>We’re raising 20,000 for our next production: Shakepseare’s <i>Much Ado About Nothing</i>. When choosing our next production, we wanted to choose a show that truly represented much of what Classics in Color has to offer as a theatre company. <i>Much Ado</i>, a comedy with drama, led by a strong, quick witted female character; set against the reality of men returning home from war;  ultimately about love and forgiveness, allows us to make our Classics in Color inclusion mark on the classics.</p>
<p>After November 9<sup>th</sup> of this year, we spent a lot of time deliberating whether or not to go forward with our next production, wondering if now was the time to raise money and ask people to support art. We know there are numerous organizations that will also need our money, our energy, and our time. We had several conversations with several company members. The largest take away from these conversations was this: <i>Our country is clearly in a place of much disconnect. Although many worthy organizations that support the rights of everyone, who fight for justice, who help organize like minded people, must be supported, these organizations are not in the business of changing people’s hearts and minds, and this, my friends, is what we need most. <strong>The arts have a unique ability to reach and change hearts and minds. It is with this in mind, we choose to move forward with our scheduled 2017 heart centered production of Much Ado About Nothing.</strong></i></p>
<p>Our Much Ado will be cast and designed inclusively; it will demonstrate a community of people of different backgrounds, ethnicities, and different ableness working together to bring a beautiful piece of accessible theatre to life. Directed by yours truly, CiC’s Much Ado will be set in the present, in the real world of friends returning from war, of true love being both easy to find and hard to admit, and of misunderstandings and reconciliation.</p>
<p>This first round of fundraising will be used for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our down payment to secure an accessible theatre rental for our three week run in the fall of 2017</li>
<li>Secure our insurance for the space and the actors</li>
<li>Pay for space rental for both auditions and rehearsal.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’d like to see a breakdown of our budgeting needs, please reach out, we would be more than happy to share it with you as we believe wholly in maintaining financial transparency.</p>
<p>Every donation is tax-deductible. If you choose a gift for your donation, the tax deductible amount is everything above the cost of the gift.</p>
<p>We are incredibly grateful for your collaboration in the work of Classics in Color: An INclusive Theatre Company. Without you, none of what we do is possible.</p>
<p>Let us change hearts and minds with our art. Let us work together, make art together, reach each other, listen to each other, and hear each other. No one said it was going to be easy.

It is paramount to get both the business and creative aspect of production 100% right in order to succeed in the industry.   What we need The costs of running and setting up a theatre company are many to say the least. Due to unfortunate circumstances The Collective has had two major backer back out due to severe personal reasons so crowd funding has become crucial.

1. Sets and Costumes - $7000
2. Lighting and Technical Support - $2000
4. Theatre Hire and associated expenses - $6000
Contributors will be rewarded with great perks, including tickets to the show, opening night and cast meet and greet.

<p>Allow us to introduce ourselves: we’re Three, A Performance Group. But more specifically, we’re Gabi, Jenny, Matthew, Yolanda, and Michelle, and it’s lovely to meet you! We put together this little group for one purpose: theatre. After graduating from the theatre program at the University of New Mexico, we came together to support each other in our artistic endeavors. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Now we’re producing not one, but two shows about the Trojan War: <i>Cassandra </i>an original work by Jenny, Yolanda, and Matthew and <i>An Iliad</i> by Lisa Peterson and Denis O'Hare. But we can’t do it alone. Between rights, props, costumes, and all the fun little tidbits that go into a show, we are needing funding to make our dreams a reality! And any bit helps!</p><p></p><h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2><p>Our ultimate goal is to reach $2500 as a combined budget for both shows. This will ensure coverage of all the essentials for which we have accounted, such as advertising, costumes, and props, but also to cover unseen issues and costs.</p><p>As a huge thank you for all your love and support, we want to make sure you get some fun perks in return!

</p><p>
</p><p><i>An Iliad</i> switches the focus of the Trojan War from epic grandeur to the human soul. An ancient  poet, tasked to retell this story for eternity, not only tells the story of that famous war countless years ago, she becomes it. She becomes every soul, every god, and every heartbreak. Long has she lost her identity to this world as she desperately needs her audience to recognize mankind’s love of violence, and the humanity it destroys. For her, the Trojan War is not simply a fairy tale, but a true, haunting horror.</p><h2>Cassandra<br/>

<p><i>Cassandra</i>
is our original work. To create our narrative we have combined classic Greek
text, modern original text, opera, pop, and movement to get to the heart of the
story of the Trojan prophet and princess. We (Jenny, Yolanda, and Matthew) have
worked as editors, co-writers, actors, and director to share an untold story of
an almost hero. Cassandra fails to convince her family and nation of the
impending destruction of Troy, she becomes a casualty of the influence of those
around her. Her story is a tragic portrait of romance, betrayal, madness, and
war. </p><h2>Show Dates and Locations</h2><div>

<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">From The Director</span><br/>
</h3> <p>Hi there, I'm Ashley Gunsteens, the director of EverScape. Thank you for visiting our page! If you've watched our video, you've gotten just a peek into how awesome this project is. When Allan's script first landed on my (metaphorical) director's desk, I was truly skeptical. Would a play about an online, role-playing video game speak to all audiences?</p>
<p>But what I read was a play that is somehow both funny and poignant, fantastical and grounded. It deals with the realities of addiction and escapism, very real issues within my generation today, but is filled with so many action-packed fight scenes and hilarious(ly real) characters that speak to you whether you are an avid WoW player or have never even touched an Xbox. One of the first comments after the New York reading of the show was from an actor who said, ""he didn't think he'd ever laughed so hard at just a reading of a play."" The show is fun. It is exciting and funny and troubling and redeeming. How often do you find new work that is all of those things?</p>
<p>I submitted this play to the NY Fringe Festival because I believe in the script, and I am passionate about creating a jaw-dropping theatrical experience, from the stylized dance and fight choreography, to the lighting, sound, weaponry and amazing cast that was needed to complement this story. I've assembled a team of young NYC creatives who are being paid peanuts (if at all) to work on this project. We are doing this because we believe in the show, and in each other, and we hope you will join us in supporting our production by donating whatever you can.</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Our journey to Auschwitz is a pilgrimage that reverberates with story, foremost that of
bringing the hero and writer Etty Hillesum's words to life where her life was taken, and ending in Belgium, where we have been invited to perform at the International Etty Hillesum Congress, </span><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">celebrating the 100th anniversary of her
birth this January. </span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">By its nature, this story is bigger,
certainly bigger than us, others having returned her words at Auschwitz as well as others surely to
follow, our own performances of Etty, <i>The Thinking Heart</i>, hopefully inspiring still
others to find new ways to tell her story, whether in film, dance, music or words. And what words!—because
to read and get to know Etty is to have a humanistic encounter of life-changing proportions. She is an
avatar of all that it means to be and remain human under the most corrosive and oppressive
circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">And there are several stories here, stories within stories: first of all, of course, Etty’s and the life of her
voice over and through time and space, crossing national borders, crossing and re-crossing continents
and oceans, the Atlantic and Pacific, crossing the borders of language (her journal and letters are read
from her native Netherlands to Japan); and it is the story of her voice through and over the Nazi
juggernaut; it is the story too of the mystery of time and space, how it happens she lived and wrote
her Holocaust journey, ending with her death in the camps at age 29, and we get to experience it in
the bosom of safe communities, rather than vice versa, that is, our perishing in the concentration
camp and Etty living to tell about it. We might ask, how is this possible. We swim in the miracle of
language like the air that sustains us. Returning her voice to Auschwitz is also the story of the mystery
of language itself, how a voice might travel through a line of prose or poetry, a life be lived again in
sound and light, in words or in film, crossing that other border between life as we know it and death,
that seeming impermeable border between the world and spirit.
</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">So we make a pilgrimage to breathe Etty Hillesum’s words where her life was taken—at Auschwitz.
Oswiecim in Polish. Auschwitz is German. It leaves an aftertaste I don’t want in my mouth. Better the
Poles take back the name. Oswiecim, yes, even though some Poles were complicit. Complicit. That
word, too, leaves an unwanted aftertaste. It is hard to get the taste of these words out of the mouth,
because we know them, they are part of us.
</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Then there is this woman, Etty Hillesum—words flow from her. They flow out, first like a little brook,
then a stream. She can’t stop them. We don’t know where they come from. They become a river, a
river of words, a river of freshness, and they flow into her notebooks and letters, even from inside
that other word, Auschwitz. Etty’s words burst the dam of Auschwitz, and now they flow out of us,
and we shudder as they wash us, at the warmth and light they leave in our mouth, in our heart.
</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">So this is a story—brook, stream, river into story. We will go there, our small ensemble, to speak her
words, and with our musician swell them in the strains of the cello. It will be winter in Auschwitz, and
we will bring Etty’s voice there to wash the snow.                             </span></p>

<p><b>Pilgrimage to the Heart</b> (<a href="""" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.pilgrimagetotheheart.org</a>) combines theater, dialogue, a book and visual art to tell the story of a woman who moves through romantic love to a deeper, more
inclusive one, refusing to allow her love of life to be diminished by the oppression to
which she is subjected during the Holocaust, 1942-43. </p>
<p style="""">
</p>
<p><b>The
Pilgrimage to the Heart Project</b> is an expansion of an original, proven ensemble
performance work (and more recently a book) that has toured throughout Maine
to over 40 diverse venues, including high schools, libraries, colleges, public
theaters, churches, temples, museums, the Maine Holocaust and Human Right
Center and the Maine State Prison.</p>
<p>The
performance work and book are called <i>The Thinking Heart: the Life and Loves of
Etty Hillesum</i>,
and the ensemble is comprised of two actors and a cellist who perform an hour
of poetry and music. The inspiration for the work originated from the
extraordinary journals and letters of Etty Hillesum, a young Jewish woman who
kept a journal during the Nazi occupation of Holland and was killed at
Auschwitz. Etty Hillesum’s journal and correspondence, published in <i>An
Interrupted Life and Letters from Westerbork, </i>was adapted into a
sequence of 48 poems and arranged for performance by Martin Steingesser in collaboration with
another actor, Judy Tierney, and a cellist, Robin Jellis. The ensemble is
committed to bringing Etty’s words and exemplary life to audiences for an
enriching and thought provoking experience, best summed up by Edward van
Voolen, Chairman of the Etty Hillesum Foundation, “Etty confronts us all with
what it means to be and remain human under the most extreme circumstances. That
is a form of resistance no oppressor can withstand. Not then, and not now.”</p>
<p>The
performance work creates a communal experience of this woman’s vision, wisdom
and humanity and an opportunity for post performance exploration and dialogue
with  audiences about what her example and courage mean to each of us in our
lives now. Keeping alive the story of a single, courageous woman, not famous or
in a position of power, provides a model for all of us, and an opportunity to
be moved to small actions in our daily life, which have the power of rippling out into the
greater life around us. Hence, our project title: <i>pilgrimage</i>, which means “the
course of life on Earth” for each person, and <i>heart</i>, symbol for courage,
love, compassion.</p>
<p>Birth and Death form a continuum, the way or path we call Life. We are all
travelers. Pilgrimage is for all who long and search for a way to the heart.</p>

Short Summary










Pilgrimage to the Heart (http://www.pilgrimagetotheheart.org) combines theater, dialogue, a book and visual art to tell the story of a woman who moves through romantic love to a deeper, more

which she is subjected during the Holocaust, 1942-43. 


The

<p>Hi, we hope you find our story as exciting as we do!</p>
<p>BROADWAY HERE WE COME!!!!</p>
<p>Hi, my name is Olivia McLeod, and I am an 11 year old grade 5 student at Sherwood Elementry School in Charlottetown Prince Edward Island. My name is Grace Rowan-Quansah, and I am a 10 year old grade 6 studen at Prince Street Elementry School also in Charlottetown Prince Edward Island.</p>
<p>Our passion is dance, and we have had training in many forms which include: tap, ballet, a small amount of highland so that we were able to do a performance, jazz (2 years), and hip hop (4 years)</p>
<p>Grace also enjoys singing, playing guitar, acting, gymnastics and has won awards for her art work.</p>
<p>Olivia also enjoys running, cross country, art class, acting, and has recently won awards and the provincial level science fair.</p>
<p>This past winter we were both dancers with the Storm Chasers which was a dance team that performed for the Summerside Storm NBL (National Pro basketball team of Canada). We both invested more than 150 volunteer hours between rehersals, and performances, we loved every minute of it, and developed some life long friendships and were looking forward to the same thing in NYC.</p>
<p>We were 2 lucky children on PEI who had the opportunity to listen to Mr. Peter Sklar speak about how to persue your aspiration of a career in the performing arts, and after an interview we were both offered a position in his prestigous Beginnings workshop camp that is being held on Braodway in New York City this August!!! This really is a once in a lifetime opportunity for us.</p>
<p>Mr. Peter Sklar is a noted talent scout, educator, and producer who has discovered or coached thousands of young performers including Sarah Jessica Parker, Reese Winterspoon, Mischa Barton, Zachary Ty Bryan, Ricki Lake, and numerous other young stars of Broadway, TV &amp; Film.</p>
<p>The highlights to this training for us include some of our mentors, coaches, and instructors. They include but are not limited to Laura Osnes who stared in Broadway's Grease, Tony Award-winning star Sutton Foster, Tracy Edwards who was in Broadway's Hairspray. and currently featured in Broadway's Legally Blonde, and Ben Cameron who was featured in Broadway's Wicken and Footloose.</p>
<p>As if that's not exciting enough or week will end with a performance on the Off-Broadway Orpheum theatre. So really you are helping us get our ""break in the bizz""</p>
<p>The best part of all of this, is the fact that we have been planning to move to NYC so that we could pursue our dreams in the theatre arts, after we complete high school, imagine when you were a child had you been given the chance to follow your dreams...Well this is our once in a lifetime chance!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The breakdown of our costs are as follows</p>
<p> </p>
<p>$1890.00 x 2 people this includes our tuition, 6 nights/7days of accommodations, and all our meals.</p>
<p>$400 x2 for airfair to NYC and home again for both Olivia and Grace</p>
<p>Every nickle that is donated will be going directly towards our trip to New York. To thank you for your donations please first and foremost know you have our upmost appreciation. We will also send you a autographed photo of us on Broadway...why autographed you ask?? Well we WILL be famous one day, so that signature will be worth something! Also seeing you are being sweet enough to donate to us, we will be providing you with PEI's best homade fudge or some fantastic cupcakes, and also some memorabilia from a popular NYC landmark.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>The production will feature <strong>Dee Dee Friedman*, David J. Goldberg*, Vinnie Penna*, and Erika Lee</strong>. John Michael Crotty is Production Stage Manager (*These actors are appearing courtesy of Actors Equity Association).<br/><br/><em><strong>Deuteranomaly</strong> is a comedic look at the challenges in loving someone who quite literally will never see the world the way you do.

Mind The Gap Theatre will present Jessica Fleitman’s comedy Deuteranomaly: A One-Act in Two Parts as part of the 4th Annual Planet Connections Theatre Festivity in New York City.  The production will be directed by Mind The Gap’s Artistic Director, Paula D’Alessandris.
The production will feature Dee Dee Friedman*, David J. Goldberg*, Vinnie Penna*, and Erika Lee. John Michael Crotty is Production Stage Manager (*These actors are appearing courtesy of Actors Equity Association).Deuteranomaly is a comedic look at the challenges in loving someone who quite literally will never see the world the way you do. When a couple discovers that their son suffers from red-green colorblindness, this seemingly innocuous diagnosis reveals dangerous rifts in their relationship. Years later, the boy is now a man struggling to relate to his talented painter girlfriend whose work he can never truly see. Worlds will collide in this colorful comedy of Jews and hues.

<p><em>Pitfalls and Promises</em> testifies to the boundless potential of the human spirit with a message of hope and perseverance. The story follows the life of a woman who overcomes a harsh childhood, a teachers ""stupid"" label, dyslexia, cancer and other life traumas to achieve prominence in her career and make a difference in the life of hundreds of men and woman. </p>
<p><strong>Who Are The Creators of Pitfalls and Promises?</strong></p>
<p>We are Natalie and Al Winters, a retired couple in our seventies, aurthor's, directors and producers of this musical play,  proving that creativity knows no age limit.</p>
<p>I'm Natalie and I wrote the music and lyrics for all thirteen songs in the show even though I don't read music. The music just flows into me and I then have a musician do the sheet music and arrangements.This may seem a long step from my 35-year career in mental health but it's simply another way of being creative.</p>
<p>My husband, Al, retired from a long corporate career in public relations. He was a speech writer and employee communications specialist. He is now pursuing his passion for theater and playwrighting.</p>
<p>We took the risk of staging the show for two performances in a small theater in the town we now live in, Cary, NC. Both performances were sold out and many people in the audience were deeply moved and urged us to mount the production again in larger venues. The problem is that we have lost a few thousand dollars producing the show. As a retired couple on fixed income, our rescources are limited. But we fervently believe that <em>Pitfalls and Promises</em> delivers a message that people want and need to hear. Our desire is to leave an audience believing that just like the main character in the show, Emma, they too can perservere and triumph over adversity.</p>
<p><strong>The importance of your contribution!</strong></p>
<p>At a time when many are struggling  to cope with life's challenges, it's crucial<strong> </strong>to deliver a message of inspiraton.<strong> </strong>You can help deliver that message through your contribution. You can help us help others know that it's important<strong> t</strong>o dream and that dreams can be realized<strong>.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Can Do!</h3>
<p>We lost a considerable amount of money producing the premier of the show even though it sold out both nights. The expenses were beyond what we had expected.</p>
<p>Now we have a larger venue for the production and expect to incur the following costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Venue rental----------------------------------------------$1,500</li>
<li>Playbill design and printing------------------------------$1,200</li>
<li>Music director/pianist------------------------------------ $2,000</li>

<p> As people walk out the door we hope they'll think ""If that woman made it after all of her problems, maybe I can do it too!"" </p>

<h3>Let's Stack Some Paper</h3>
<p>We are asking for <strong>$750</strong> that will go directly toward our latest project BACKSTAGE AT HORROR DRAG at <a href=""http://incubatorarts.org/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">The Incubator Arts Project</a> February 21st - 24th, with a special encore performance at JACK Arts Center February 28th-March 1st.  As of right now, every bit of funding toward our work has come out of our own pockets.</p>
<p>This funding would provide :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Props!</strong> Lots of glitter, blood, gore and pistachios are going to be needed every single night in order to deliver the most fabulous horror your eyes won't be able to unsee.</li>
<li>
<strong>Costumes! </strong>We need short shorts for our Ball Boys and wedding gowns brides were buried in. </li>
<li>
<strong>Rehearsal space! </strong>Real estate in this city doesn't come cheap babies, and although we rehearse in back alleys whenever possible, it's gotten cold outside.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>The Show</strong></h3>
<p class=""p1"">Inspired by the real-life Filipino drag sensation Ryan Robles, ""Backstage at Horror Drag"" imagines a flourishing niche of performance and the community of people who give their lives to it, despite the nearly total lack of recognition or reward. Through a series of live drag sets intercut with scenes of backstage intrigue, “Backstage at Horror Drag” is made of glamour, stage blood, glitter explosions, and above all; lip-syncing.</p>
<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>Founded in 2010, we are ANIMALS: NIKKI CALONGE, MIKE MIKOS, MICHAEL DE ANGELIS. Utilizing various modes of visual art and performance, ANIMALS move through dance, puppetry, script and video in order to create moments that question the flexibility of the world around us and the nature of humans through irreverence, instinct, ability and play.</p>

<h3>Sasquatch: The Musical premieres in New York with a professional reading on Thursday, August 1 at 8:00 PM in the National Comedy Theatre!</h3>
<p>Your donation directly contributes to this production!</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.sasquatchthemusical.com/images/stm_postcard_v2-u1594.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What This Is</h3>
<p>The Story:</p>
<p>Scientist Kenneth Henderson is called upon to help the struggling town of Spoons, Washington solve the mystery of a haunting prophecy that has led to the disappearance of several children. The locals believe it to be the work of the mysterious creature in the woods, the Sasquatch. Kenneth works reluctantly alongside cryptozoologist Jane Goodall to solve the case while prejudice and hysteria in the down threaten to destroy their progress. As they grow ever closer to the truth, and to each other, they discover a shocking surprise, and only the Sasquatch himself – with the help of an unlikely young hero – will be able to save the day for them and the missing children.  A comedic musical journey defying genre and time, <em>Sasquatch: the Musical</em> explores that most beloved of North American folk myths, Bigfoot, and celebrates the power of belief in everyone.</p>
<p>The Authors:</p>
<p>Book, music, and lyrics by Matthew Lucas and Patrick McElroy, and orchestration by Matt Shervey.</p>
<p>The Legend:</p>
<p>Now that Sasquatch: The Musical has had its hugely successful world premier on stage at Grove City High School, it's time to take the next big-footed step in the Squatch journey, with script and music revisions and a professional staged reading.  That's where you come in... </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Developing a new musical isn't cheap, what with gas prices the way they are.  So we need some help.  In addition to fostering our eternal gratitude and a secure place in North American Sasquatch lore, your contributions will help us do the following:</p>
<p>-Book a rehearsal and performance space in New York City<br/>-Pay performers, a director, and an accompanist<br/>-Pay for accommodations and nourishment for performers during rehearsals and performances<br/>-Cover travel costs for out-of-town performers and members of the creative team<br/>-Continue to publicize the project to potential producers, publishers, and collaborators</p>
<p>Check out the list of perks to see what your gift will get you, including signed posters, personalized video messages from the Sasquatch, and soap provided by our friends at <a href=""http://www.sasquatchsoap.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sasquatch Soap Co.</a>! </p>
<p><em>(Merchandise to be delivered by September 01, 2013.)</em></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We feel that the world needs to know the story of Sasquatch, and we intend to tell it...tell it well and true.</p>
<p>A professional reading is an important step in making this musical the best it can be.  We hope to find a publisher and potential investors in future productions, so that Sasquatch can find the audience he deserves.</p>

What This Is
The Story:
Scientist Kenneth Henderson is called upon to help the struggling town of Spoons, Washington solve the mystery of a haunting prophecy that has led to the disappearance of several children. The locals believe it to be the work of the mysterious creature in the woods, the Sasquatch. Kenneth works reluctantly alongside cryptozoologist Jane Goodall to solve the case while prejudice and hysteria in the down threaten to destroy their progress. As they grow ever closer to the truth, and to each other, they discover a shocking surprise, and only the Sasquatch himself – with the help of an unlikely young hero – will be able to save the day for them and the missing children.  A comedic musical journey defying genre and time, Sasquatch: the Musical explores that most beloved of North American folk myths, Bigfoot, and celebrates the power of belief in everyone.
The Authors:
Book, music, and lyrics by Matthew Lucas and Patrick McElroy, and orchestration by Matt Shervey.
The Legend:
Now that Sasquatch: The Musical has had its hugely successful world premier on stage at Grove City High School, it's time to take the next big-footed step in the Squatch journey, with script and music revisions and a professional staged reading.  That's where you come in... 
 


What We Need & What You Get
Developing a new musical isn't cheap, what with gas prices the way they are.  So we need some help.  In addition to fostering our eternal gratitude and a secure place in North American Sasquatch lore, your contributions will help us do the following:
-Book a rehearsal and performance space in New York City-Pay performers, a director, and an accompanist-Pay for accommodations and nourishment for performers during rehearsals and performances-Cover travel costs for out-of-town performers and members of the creative team-Continue to publicize the project to potential producers, publishers, and collaborators
Check out the list of perks to see what your gift will get you, including signed posters, personalized video messages from the Sasquatch, and soap provided by our friends at Sasquatch Soap Co.! 
(Merchandise to be delivered by September 01, 2013.)


The Impact
We feel that the world needs to know the story of Sasquatch, and we intend to tell it...tell it well and true.
A professional reading is an important step in making this musical the best it can be.  We hope to find a publisher and potential investors in future productions, so that Sasquatch can find the audience he deserves.

<p>Have you noticed I’ve been doing a lot of Shakespeare recently? In the last couple years, I have done Romeo &amp; Juliet, A Midsummer Night’s Dream (three times!), As You Like It, The Taming of the Shrew and I am currently rehearsing All’s Well That Ends Well. I love Shakespeare intensely and it has changed my life in so many ways.  I feel crazy lucky.</p>
<p>Here’s the kicker- all my knowledge of how to approach acting in Shakespeare plays comes from the following: instinct, watching other people do it, or making it up. And it terrifies me. I love these plays so much and want to do them justice. Once I’ve been cast in a show, it’s so exciting and scary because I never know what my process is going to be like. Shakespeare &amp; Company offers a month long program where I can get the tools, inspiration and support I need to approach the Bard fearlessly! It is in Lenox, MA! The program is in January 2014, but I need to pay by October.</p>
<p>Here is a link to the program if you'd like to read more about it:</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.shakespeare.org/training/comprehensive-training/the-month-long-intensive/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.shakespeare.org/training/comprehensi...</a></p>
<p>The program costs a total of $3,700. It includes housing! </p>
<p>My amazing parents have offered to pay $700 of that, and help me buy a plane ticket. The reason that the campaign is for $3,200 is because indiegogo and paypal both have some fees, so I will be funded about $200 less than the ultimate campaign goal.</p>
<p>If for some insanely wonderful reason, I exceed my funding goal, I will use the rest of the money to feed myself and put it towards my airfare! That would be really incredible.</p>
<p>I would be forever grateful if you could help me come up with the money for this incredible program!</p>

<p><em><strong>A little bit more about me and my passion:</strong></em></p>
<p>If you know me, you probably know that all my education has been pretty non traditional! I homeschooled my whole life, didn’t go to college, and chose to move to the bay area in 2008 to become a working theatre actor.</p>
<p>Guess what?! It worked. I have been working for the last five years on INCREDIBLE projects with AMAZING companies.  To mention a few: Marin Shakes, Cal Shakes, Livermore Shakes, New Conservatory Theatre, SF Shakes, Berkeley Rep and Shotgun Players. And last but not least, Impact Theatre- where I am a proud resident actor and company member.</p>
<p>I’m running around and getting cast in shows and working my butt off. BUT. I know that I am at a point where there are companies and roles that I cannot achieve without additional training and growth. I want to build and sustain my career as an actor in the Bay Area. I love living here and want to be able to stay here and continue to find work.</p>

<p>By helping me get this training, which is so important to my growth, you are helping me achieve my crazy goal of sustaining myself through being an actor. This will not go unnoticed. My heart is already so very full of love for the people and companies who I get to work with- you people amaze me with your generosity and warmth already. I will be so grateful, so thrilled, so full of love and admiration for you.</p>
<p>I also love to bake you snickerdoodles and make you handmade cards.</p>
<p><em><strong>What if you love this idea but have no money:</strong></em></p>
<p>I really get it! I live paycheck to paycheck which is why I'm asking for this money in the first place :-)</p>
<p>I totally understand if you don’t have money to donate to this project! No need to fret. I would just be so happy if you could share this with people you know who might be interested in helping out!</p>

<h3>When Eyes Speak </h3>
<p>Last year, we had the idea along with SAFEhouse Arts to bring an Indian Choreography Festival to San Francisco. This year, along with American Conservatory Theatre's Art Share program and the Zellerbach Foundation, we are thrilled to bring you the second festival, now four days long with incredible artists from New York, India, and Malaysia.  </p>
<p>Artists presented this year include, Preeti Vasudevan, Rasika Kumar and Ensemble, Vaibhav Arekar, Arun Mathai, Ananya Ashok and Inner Space Dance - Temple of Fine Arts Malaysia.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Curators </h3>
<p>Preethi Ramaprasad, Shruti Abhishek, and Sri Thina Subramaniam are three Indian classical dancers with very different backgrounds.  All three of these dancers perform passionately all over the world and came together with one unified vision:  to make the Indian arts accessible by way of music, dance, and storytelling. When Eyes Speak Festival is their contribution towards achieving this goal.  </p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Preethi grew up in the United States but trained in Bharatanatyam from Sudharani Raghupathy in Chennai.  She is currently pursuing her Ph.D. in Critical Dance Studies.  Shruti Abhishek grew up and studied Bharatanatyam and Theatre in Mumbai under the guidance of her guru Vaibhav Arekar.  Today, she runs her own school in the Bay Area.  Sri Thina is from Malaysia where she trained intensely in Bharatanatyam and Odissi at the Temple of Fine Arts.  She has lived in and collaborated with artists in London (where she worked with Mavin Khoo), Vancouver, San Francisco, and now New York. </span></p>
<p>This year at When Eyes Speak, the collective will be presenting an ensemble work together, ""The Affair.""  This piece tells the story of an empowered woman, Radha, as she navigates her relationship with Krishna.  </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Your contributions will go towards the remuneration for the artists in this festival.  Although we are fortunate to receive some grants, in order for the productions to be at their best quality, we need your help to be able to pay all these artists.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This festival is significant to us because it places Indian diasporic movement and choreography in a different environment; for it to be valued and understood.  We hope to foster conversations about social justice, understanding, and camaraderie through our performances and panel discussions.  Last year, When Eyes Speak helped garner curiosity in the Indian arts from the San Francisco community, and we aim to nurture this interest going forward. Our aim is to have Indian dance seen in the same light as other contemporary dance forms.</p>
</div><div><p> </p></div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<ul>
<li>Spread the word about the festival and this campaign via social media or personal messages!</li>
<li>Attend our performances, we would love to meet you!  </li>

When Eyes Speak Festival is their contribution towards achieving this goal.  
Preethi grew up in the United States but trained in Bharatanatyam from Sudharani Raghupathy in Chennai.  She is currently pursuing her Ph.D. in Critical Dance Studies.  Shruti Abhishek grew up and studied Bharatanatyam and Theatre in Mumbai under the guidance of her guru Vaibhav Arekar.  Today, she runs her own school in the Bay Area.  Sri Thina is from Malaysia where she trained intensely in Bharatanatyam and Odissi at the Temple of Fine Arts.  She has lived in and collaborated with artists in London (where she worked with Mavin Khoo), Vancouver, San Francisco, and now New York. 
This year at When Eyes Speak, the collective will be presenting an ensemble work together, ""The Affair.""  This piece tells the story of an empowered woman, Radha, as she navigates her relationship with Krishna.  
 

What We Need
Your contributions will go towards the remuneration for the artists in this festival.  Although we are fortunate to receive some grants, in order for the productions to be at their best quality, we need your help to be able to pay all these artists.
 

The Impact
This festival is significant to us because it places Indian diasporic movement and choreography in a different environment; for it to be valued and understood.  We hope to foster conversations about social justice, understanding, and camaraderie through our performances and panel discussions.  Last year, When Eyes Speak helped garner curiosity in the Indian arts from the San Francisco community, and we aim to nurture this interest going forward. Our aim is to have Indian dance seen in the same light as other contemporary dance forms.

<h2>VIVO BALLET &amp; #VIVO2K19</h2>
<p>After an extremely successful first Fall Season, Vivo Ballet is moving into 2019 with exciting new projects and opportunities to share our love for dance and storytelling with you and the community at large.</p>
<p>VIVO Ballet, founded by acclaimed choreographer Enzo Celli, is a virtuosic group of artists who are working passionately to bring Celli's work and visions to new audiences everywhere.</p>
<h2>What we need and what you get!</h2>
<p>In the coming year, VIVO Ballet plans to produce new repertoire for the Spring Season in March 2019.  Off the heels of our last season, we are seeking a new theater opportunity with greater theatrical capabilities, rehearsal space, costumes, and increased compensation for both the dancers and the administrative staff.</p>
<p>We set our goal at $10,000 to guarantee the development our company needs in  order to reach national and international audiences starting with you… New York!  </p>
<p>To match the generosity of your contributions, we are pleased to offer a number of unique gifts in exchange for your love and support. For example, those donating at least $100.00+ receive a guest pass to one of Enzo Celli's classes (which can be gifted to a dancer you know ), a free t-shirt, and one free ticket to our Spring Season 2019.</p>
<p>Should we fall short of our goal this time, any money gained will be directed to the cost of the theater, with ticket sales and private donations making up payment for the dancers.</p>
<p>As to now, VIVO Ballet has been a labor of love for both Celli and his amazing team. All of the tools to create great art are in place, all that is missing is your support to make this dream a reality.</p>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
</div><div>
<p>VIVO Ballet's presence in New York City is very important. Our work combines European sensibility with the technical prowess and artistry of American trained dancers. This rare combination allows us to bridge cultural gaps, and expose New York to something that it has never seen before.  </p>
<p>In 2019, VIVO Ballet will be implementing an outreach program to support education in the arts for New York Public Schools. With the resources to allot to our show, we will be able to help provide children with the benefits that an education in the arts cultivates. Additionally, this will provide our dancers with additional work, serving to recognize their expertise, train them as educators, and develop them as caretakers for their community.</p>
<p>Going forward, we also plan to create new opportunities for dancers in New York City to train with artists from Europe.</p>
<h2><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h2>
</div><div>
<p>The largest challenge we face in our success is the extreme concentration of dance in New York City. There is so much work to support and sometimes people aren't sure where their contributions will be useful.</p>
<p>What separates us from others is that the stories we make are not just for the dance world or for ourselves. The stories we tell are for everyone. Your contribution to our campaign can help us have a lasting impression on audiences for years to come. That starts with your help.</p>

If you live in the Los Angeles area, come check out the show! We open June 7th at the Hollywood Fringe Festival and run all the way to the 29th. In addition, share this page with all of your friends and family to help spread the word.

<h3>January Is For Making Dances</h3>
<p>NACHMO is an annual choreography challenge open to everyone. Inspired by National Novel Writing Month, Sharyn and Anna started it in the fall of 2009 as a way to push ourselves to do creative work and hold ourselves to a deadline. At the time, we were two busy dancers without a lot of time or money to devote to choreographing. But we thought if we gave ourselves a deadline and worked alongside a group of fellow dance artists, we could each create a dance in a month. We recruited four friends to join us, and launched National Choreography Month.</p>
<p>Each year, more participants join, attracted by the challenge, the community it builds, and the opportunity to show new dance work as part of a mixed bill. In the past 8 years, there have been NACHMO shows in Brooklyn, Boston, DC, San Francisco, and Columbus. Last season, we had over 230 people participate and this season we hope to have over 300.</p>
<p>Making a new dance can be quite expensive and time consuming - paying for studio space to rehearse in, finding and compensating dancers, renting a performance venue, marketing the show, employing a photographer or videographer to document the performance - it can be a daunting process to jump into. That's why we take care of the production side of things so participants can focus on the dance making.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need To Make NACHMO Happen...</h3>
<p>The NACHMO challenge can be done on a shoestring. Every year some awesome solos are crafted in bedrooms at no expense to anyone. But bringing people together and producing the shows that celebrate the new dances takes some cash. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Participants register for the challenge through the website. It's updated by our volunteer staff, but we do have to pay GoDaddy ($60) and Squarespace ($180).</li>
<li>The theater we rent for our Brooklyn shows costs $1600 for two nights. It's a great deal because they provide front of house staff, an awesome lighting designer, and tech rehearsal the afternoon before each show. But we have to buy event insurance ($125).</li>
<li>We rely heavily on social media and word of mouth to let people know about NACHMO, but some well-placed postcards are critical to attracting participants and audience ($35).</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We'll let our 2016 participants speak for us here:</p>
<p>""It connects me to others who have the creative gene but don't act on it nearly enough. It is a yearly reminder to expand myself, and do something with my ideas.""</p>
<p>""I think as artists we tend to be dreamers. This opportunity forced us to move forward with our thoughts and sometimes we need that push to just get out of our heads and go for it.""</p>
<p>""NACHMO provided me with the push (hello one month deadline!) I needed to move past my doubts, excuses, and insecurities and just create work! It then went further and gave me a platform to share this work. The reason this was especially important to me is because I find that it can be very challenging to find opportunities such as this for choreographers that are not established. NACHMO also connected me to a community of dancers, choreographers, and artists that have inspired me and provided invaluable advice on continuing to navigate what it means to be a dancer and the myriad ways dance can be pursued.""</p>

<p>Hi, there. I'm <strong>Peter Foldy</strong>. I hope you’ve had a chance to look at our video presentation, but in case you’ve skipped it, here some info on myself and the project. I’m a writer / director with a number of feature films under my belt. Prior to my life in film I had the good fortune to enjoy some success in the music business.</p>
<p>Life in the arts is always a roller coaster ride but it’s what I love to do. I’m now making a foray into the world of theater with a cheeky little comedy that I am directing called <strong>Penetration</strong>. It is scheduled for seven performances during the <strong>Hollywood Fringe Festival</strong> and I’m here on Indiegogo because I need your help. The venue has been booked, the wheels are in motion but the production is currently $3,250 underfunded and we now have 15 days in which to raise this money.</p>
<p>It’s not a huge amount but essential to making the project happen. The funds we raise will go toward rehearsal space rentals, poster design, printing of cards, programs and posters, essential crew such as Stage Managers - as well as the all important promotion and publicity. Myself, the producer and the actors are not taking any of the cash that we hope to raise. It's all going into making this show happen.</p>
<p>So why does this matter, and why should you give us a helping hand?</p>
<p><i><strong>Because Art Matters.</strong></i></p>
<p>It helps us see the world from different perspectives. It allows us to reflect on our own lives and it brings people together. By contributing to this production you would become a part of something unique -  your support immensely appreciated.</p>

<h3>About The Play</h3>
<p>It’s the night before the 2016 Presidential election. Though Cody Weber has taken a purity pledge with his conservative fiancé, Linda, to not have sex until they are married, he can’t help but secretly visit an internet chat room where he meets an attractive young model named Amanda. Overcome by guilt he doesn’t go through with the video encounter but is shocked when the girl shows up in his apartment. With Cody’s fiancé returning in the morning and Amanda unable (or unwilling) to leave, Cody has a life changing decision to make.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Producer:</h3>
<p><strong>Cas Hodges</strong>, an experienced UK theater producer with over 20 productions under her belt, including a number of Edinburgh Fringe productions.</p>
<h3>Our Cast:</h3>
<p><strong>Trent Brown, Julia Henning, Alex Sturman</strong> and <strong>Swayde McCoy</strong> are extremely talented actors, all working hard on this play in order to showcase their talent and this production at the 2017 Hollywood Fringe Festival.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Spencer Frankeberger, and I received a BM in Music Therapy and an MFA in Film Production from Florida State University where I created a zany, drag queen-filled short musical film that I felt had more of a story to it than being just a ""fun, campy show,"" and I decide to write and compose my own live stage show version of it to express topics of masculinity, acceptance, and keeping hope alive.</p>
<p>This project is a labor of love filled with an array of quirkiness, fun, and some of the catchiest songs you can imagine!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As putting up a theatrical production can be expensive, Hollywood Fringe adds additional rates, such as registration fees and specific marketing requirements.  That being said, here's what your gracious donations go toward:</p>
<p>~$400/performance x5 = $2000</p>
<p>stipend/cast and crew = $3500</p>
<p>scripts and props = $100</p>
<p>marketing assistance (flyering, printing postcards, additional marketing, impressions) = $500</p>
<p>rehearsal space = $500</p>
<p>registration fee = $250</p>
<p>insurance = $200</p>
<p>IndieGoGo taxes = $500</p>
<p>Additional Expenses = $550</p>
<p>Total: $8, 100</p>
<p>While this is a lot to ask, any and ALL donations do help me reach the goal that I hope to achieve with this fundraising campaign.</p>
<p>We have some really unique and individual perks including YOUR VERY OWN, PERSONALIZED JINGLE on GUITAR, PIANO, A CAPPELLA, or with PERCUSSION as well as some other perks such as soundtrack downloads, a download of the performance, comp tickets to the show, etc.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I want to share this project to provide another production that pushes the boundaries of musical theatre and promotes more than just a fluffy musical--proving that musicals can have depth and engaging subject matter while also being fun, quirky, catchy, and campy as well.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>One of the biggest risks with producing theatre is the budget.  Having recently been the supervising producer for a theatrical production, I understand how much work is put into a production (I've stage managed, assistant directing, been props master, etc. for other productions) and how much others are willing to sacrifice to make your vision become a reality.  I understand that long hours will pay off, but that it's a long road to get there, and I'm willing to do whatever it takes, even saving up to put on this production myself, even if it takes more time--but it's ready now.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>While these donations won't necessarily break the bank, I completely understand if your financial situation is not beneficial for your ability to donate right now, and all I ask is that, even if you cannot donate even just a dollar or two, that you like our FB page and follow us on Twitter and Instagram and then share this project with everyone you know.</p>

It's a reaction to the past 18 months, but mostly it's about what has come up for us in the now. Informally, in several meetings over the course of the summer, we started with exploring the idea of what is ordinary and what is extraordinary. How something can be one or the other, or both. We gathered outside in parks and backyards when we could, played theater games, had conversations, created scenes and characters, and let ourselves explore. </p><p>What we've workshopped from that time is a series of observations that have branched out from our initial ordinary/extraordinary theme. Some became silly sketches, others more introspective monologues and some are a little bit of both. It's not a play in the way we often think of a play, with a beginning, middle and end, perfectly polished and perfected. <strong>But, it is <i>play</i>. </strong></p><p><strong>Our commitment to each other.</strong></p><p>You'll see that in some moments actors may have a script in their hand or read from their phone. Some nights one actor will step in for another to play a part in order to accommodate schedules and other life obligations. Part of our process was to also be supportive of where each artist was at throughout our time together and not let other priorities or obligations preclude anyone from participating. </p><p><strong>How can you help?</strong></p><p><i>Together We Gather </i>is free for all audiences!

It's a reaction to the past 18 months, but mostly it's about what has come up for us in the now. Informally, in several meetings over the course of the summer, we started with exploring the idea of what is ordinary and what is extraordinary. How something can be one or the other, or both. We gathered outside in parks and backyards when we could, played theater games, had conversations, created scenes and characters, and let ourselves explore. What we've workshopped from that time is a series of observations that have branched out from our initial ordinary/extraordinary theme. Some became silly sketches, others more introspective monologues and some are a little bit of both. It's not a play in the way we often think of a play, with a beginning, middle and end, perfectly polished and perfected. But, it is play. Our commitment to each other.You'll see that in some moments actors may have a script in their hand or read from their phone. Some nights one actor will step in for another to play a part in order to accommodate schedules and other life obligations. Part of our process was to also be supportive of where each artist was at throughout our time together and not let other priorities or obligations preclude anyone from participating. How can you help?Together We Gather is free for all audiences!

The Basics
 
In
 March 2012, Theater for the New City, an Obie-winning performance venue
 in downtown Manhattan, will present the world premiere of Heather 
Hill's play Heathens, directed by Stefanie Sertich. 

Set on an isolated farm in eastern Kentucky, Heathens is

he finds a lot more than he bargains for in the home she shares with 
her sister and her Mamaw. The play explores mourning, faith, and the 
dangers of isolation as the characters do battle with themselves and 
each other.
 
Our team has been collaborating on this play for over a year and a half 
in workshops and readings.  We have put together a fabulous group. The cast 
includes Lisa Roberts Gillan, Linda Larkin, Trevor Long, and Andy 
Powers. Edward Ross is the set designer, and Dan Jobbins is the lighting
 designer. 
 
What We're Asking for and What You Receive 
 
Theater
 for the New City is providing the performance and rehearsal space, but 
we must still raise the funds for all of the production 
elements -- creating a set evocative of the sisters' Kentucky home, the 
guys' costumes (as Andy so eloquently says in the video), a Christmas 
tree.... Yes, we said a Christmas tree. Come see the play and you'll see 
why! And we also need to pay for the set build, sound equipment, a stage
 manager... the list is very specific, but rather lengthy. 
 
In
 thanks for your support, besides our unending gratitude, we have all of
 the fabulous perks listed to the side, ranging from trendy Heathens 
baseball caps to your own private harp concert!

years. They are an award winning physical theatre company based in Cape Town in South Africa. Magnet
Theatre believes that we all have a responsibility to develop a more just, free

for one reason or another gain access to tertiary institutions like the university
or the theatre profession. The 2 year training acts as a bridge into the
universities and into the professional performance industry as a whole.</p>
<p>Lat year
as part of their training , with support from ASSITEJ and Roberto Frabetti from
La Barracca, the trainees made a theatre project for 3 -5 years old to take to
the most forgotten child care centres
and crèches of the Cape Town townships.<span>  TREE/

Theatre 
has been committed to transformation in the theatre industry  in South Africa for the past 25
years. They are an award winning physical theatre company based in Cape Town in South Africa. Magnet
Theatre believes that we all have a responsibility to develop a more just, free
and peaceful South African society. Transformation can never be only about
developing skill. Fundamentally it involves developing  creativity, the
ability to imagine alternative realities and dream different futures.
Magnet
Theatre runs a full time training program for young township performers who cannot
for one reason or another gain access to tertiary institutions like the university
or the theatre profession. The 2 year training acts as a bridge into the
universities and into the professional performance industry as a whole.
Lat year
as part of their training , with support from ASSITEJ and Roberto Frabetti from
La Barracca, the trainees made a theatre project for 3 -5 years old to take to
the most forgotten child care centres
and crèches of the Cape Town townships.  TREE/
BOOM/ UMTHI is a delicate tender performance about the relationship between a
man and a tree and the seasons. It is performed in three different languages depending
on the audience and uses song, image and the physical body to tell the story .



Theatre
for the very young is a new territory of
performance that is opening up in South Africa thanks to the efforts of ASSITEJ
South Africa. Magnet Theatre understands it to be extremely important as a way to nourish
intelligence and to develop sensibility and competencies in the very young. 



TREE/
BOOM/ UMTHI has now been invited to perform at the
FESTIVAL FOR EARLY YEARS IN Bologna Italy in March 2014. For all 5 performers it will
be the very first time that they have the opportunity to travel outside of South
Africa.
By helping these young people you will:

Support their
first ever trip outside of South Africa
Allow
them to showcase their work on an international platform 
Allow them
to gain in confidence and visibility not only to themselves but to an international
audience
Allow
them to observe and learn  from other baby theatre
projects
Help
them learn grow and access the inspiration so that they can follow their
dreams to come back to South Africa and grow theatre for the very young in their
own communities

My answer was immediately yes, not only because of Sigi's talent and experience as an actress, or 
the fact that she has almost booked this role several times in the past 
decade, but because of her incredibly close connection to Anne. Since 
then, we have been collaborating to create not just a show, but an eclectic 
experience, complementing the play with talkbacks and process groups 
aimed at involving the community in this production and opening a conversation about the Holocaust. With the commitment of our cast and crew, director <a href=""http://www.sabrinalloyd.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sabrina Lloyd</a>,The Cupcake Theater, and 
you, we look forward to bringing it all to life!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Sigi Gradwohl and Anne Frank</h3><p>At
 our first cast read-through, one of our cast members said to Sigi, 
""Wow, you really look like Anne!"" Sigi shares many similarities with
 Anne; she's talkative, the youngest in the family, impatient, creative,
 feisty, the girl everyone knows, and has a shared disinterest in math. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/277348/files/20131224113712-anne-frank.jpg?1387913832"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/277349/files/20131224113744-30190_622518850102_1769621_n.jpg?1387913864"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em; width: 256.747px; height: 280px;""/></p>                                       <i>Anne Frank and Sigi Gradwohl</i><p></p><p>But
 it is her family's connection to Anne Frank that really drove her 
desire to play this role. Sigi's grandfather, Peter Neuhaus, was in 
Anne's class, pictured below, in what was likely the last photo taken 
with Anne in it.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/277353/files/20131224114000-af_class.jpg?1387914000"" src="""" style=""""/></p><i>Anne's class at Montessori Primary School in Amsterdam. She can be seen

Over
 the past few years, Sigi's older sister Nirit Gradwohl Pisano, a 
psychologist who specializes in the intergenerational transmission of trauma, 
started delving into the trauma inherited by the third generation of the Holocaust. Nirit's work 
inspired Sigi to begin contemplating the effects on her own life as a 
third generation survivor. Were it not for the luck of her grandfather's
 father having a Swiss passport, and her grandmother (pictured below) 
escaping Germany on one of the last Kindertransports to England, her 
family's fate could have been the same as that of the Franks. Sigi began to comprehend why she so strongly relates to the material.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/277350/files/20131224113846-152_5224.jpg?1387913926"" src="""" style=""""/></p><i>Sigi's grandmother, Esther Gradwohl-Wajsblat (second from the left), escaped Germany <i>at the age of seven</i> with her older sister, Fani (second from the right), on one of the last Kindertransports to London. Her mother (left), eldest sister Toni (middle), and father (right) perished in the Holocaust.<br/></i><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Why help this particular production?</h3><p>Because of Sigi's close connection to Anne Frank, and, coincidentally, the close connection to the Holocaust of many of our additional cast members, we do not simply want this to be a good show. We will be incorporating various elements to bring the experience to life, and open up a dialogue about the Holocaust and its lingering effects today. To do all this, we need support to cover both basic expenses and our enhanced concept for this production. These expenses include:</p><ul>
<li>Materials to transform the stage into the annex where Anne and her family and the Van Daans hid for two years, including lighting and period-appropriate wardrobe<br/>
</li>
<li>Performance rights through Dramatists Play Services and use of the Cupcake Theater<br/>
</li>
<li>Scheduled talkbacks by invited guests, including Holocaust survivors <br/>
</li>
<li>Process group with the cast led by psychologist, Holocaust-researcher, and author Dr. Nirit Gradwohl Pisano (Sigi's sister)<br/>
</li>
<li>Material needed for live web stream sessions to reach a wider audience<br/>
</li>
</ul><p>The rights have been purchased and our performance dates are set, so even if we are unable to reach our fundraising goal, this production will move forward. We hope that you see the value in providing the community with this dialogue, and choose to support our efforts! Either way we hope to see you at the show!<br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Perks</h3><p></p><ul>
<li>Tickets! (Producer will contact Supporters for reservations)</li>
<li>Recognition!</li>
<li>Signed books!</li>
</ul><p></p><p>As you can see to the right, all support levels come with tickets to a performance (which may be divided among more than one performance). Our goal is for you to be a part of the experience with us. For our out of town supporters, we are exploring live web streaming of each talkback and process group, and for those local to Los Angeles, we look forward to having you participate in the discussions.

Sigi approached me a few months ago with the desire to put up this production. My answer was immediately yes, not only because of Sigi's talent and experience as an actress, or 
the fact that she has almost booked this role several times in the past 
decade, but because of her incredibly close connection to Anne. Since 
then, we have been collaborating to create not just a show, but an eclectic 
experience, complementing the play with talkbacks and process groups 
aimed at involving the community in this production and opening a conversation about the Holocaust. With the commitment of our cast and crew, director Sabrina Lloyd,The Cupcake Theater, and 
you, we look forward to bringing it all to life!Sigi Gradwohl and Anne FrankAt
 our first cast read-through, one of our cast members said to Sigi, 
""Wow, you really look like Anne!"" Sigi shares many similarities with
 Anne; she's talkative, the youngest in the family, impatient, creative,
 feisty, the girl everyone knows, and has a shared disinterest in math.                                        Anne Frank and Sigi GradwohlBut
 it is her family's connection to Anne Frank that really drove her 
desire to play this role. Sigi's grandfather, Peter Neuhaus, was in 
Anne's class, pictured below, in what was likely the last photo taken 
with Anne in it.Anne's class at Montessori Primary School in Amsterdam. She can be seen 
standing in the back right wearing white, next to her teacher. Sigi's 
grandfather, Peter, is seated in the middle of the classroom, grinning. Click here for an article about Peter and Anne.For much of her life, Sigi's connection to Anne was simply a stated fact. Over
 the past few years, Sigi's older sister Nirit Gradwohl Pisano, a 
psychologist who specializes in the intergenerational transmission of trauma, 
started delving into the trauma inherited by the third generation of the Holocaust. Nirit's work 
inspired Sigi to begin contemplating the effects on her own life as a 
third generation survivor. Were it not for the luck of her grandfather's
 father having a Swiss passport, and her grandmother (pictured below) 
escaping Germany on one of the last Kindertransports to England, her 
family's fate could have been the same as that of the Franks. Sigi began to comprehend why she so strongly relates to the material.Sigi's grandmother, Esther Gradwohl-Wajsblat (second from the left), escaped Germany at the age of seven with her older sister, Fani (second from the right), on one of the last Kindertransports to London. Her mother (left), eldest sister Toni (middle), and father (right) perished in the Holocaust.Why help this particular production?Because of Sigi's close connection to Anne Frank, and, coincidentally, the close connection to the Holocaust of many of our additional cast members, we do not simply want this to be a good show. We will be incorporating various elements to bring the experience to life, and open up a dialogue about the Holocaust and its lingering effects today. To do all this, we need support to cover both basic expenses and our enhanced concept for this production. These expenses include:
Materials to transform the stage into the annex where Anne and her family and the Van Daans hid for two years, including lighting and period-appropriate wardrobe

Performance rights through Dramatists Play Services and use of the Cupcake Theater

Scheduled talkbacks by invited guests, including Holocaust survivors 

Process group with the cast led by psychologist, Holocaust-researcher, and author Dr. Nirit Gradwohl Pisano (Sigi's sister)

Material needed for live web stream sessions to reach a wider audience

The rights have been purchased and our performance dates are set, so even if we are unable to reach our fundraising goal, this production will move forward. We hope that you see the value in providing the community with this dialogue, and choose to support our efforts! Either way we hope to see you at the show!Perks
Tickets! (Producer will contact Supporters for reservations)
Recognition!
Signed books!
As you can see to the right, all support levels come with tickets to a performance (which may be divided among more than one performance). Our goal is for you to be a part of the experience with us. For our out of town supporters, we are exploring live web streaming of each talkback and process group, and for those local to Los Angeles, we look forward to having you participate in the discussions. We will show our appreciation of each person's support with recognition in our lobby and program, as this show certainly will not reach its full potential without you!  (If you are an out-of-towner, so don't need tickets, but would like to support, you may choose the $1 support option, and then enter any amount you'd like to give!)This is a production to support the creative community of Los Angeles, while at the same time highlighting and processing Holocaust-specific experiences and recognizing the lingering effects of the trauma.
