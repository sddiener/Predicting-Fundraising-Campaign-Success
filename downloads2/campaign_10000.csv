Who doesn’t love bacon? Even people who aren’t supposed to love bacon often secretly love bacon, or at least admire it from afar. The best way to eat bacon is, of course, the simplest: the bacon sandwich. We’ve decided to combine two of our passions in life, making art and making bacon sandwiches into the awesomeness that will be…</p><p><br/><strong>The Bacon Sandwich Visual Cookbook.</strong></p><p><br/><i>Not just any cookbook</i>, these 125 recipes are presented in diagrammatic format. Essentially, each recipe looks like a bunch of stripes. Each colour signifies an ingredient, and the width of the stripe tells you how much of the ingredient you should be using. Figure it all out using the colour chart at the back of the book. Work for your bacon sandwich.</p><p><br/>Recipes in the cookbook range from ridiculously simple, your hangover-busting basic bacon sarnie, to sublimely intricate. To qualify as a bacon sandwich, each recipe must include bacon and a type of bread. Everything else is optional.</p><p><br/><b>The Bacon Sandwich Visual Cookbook is a cookbook and an art book.</b> Right now, it’s in our minds, but very soon it will be a digital delight and a real live, stunning quality, printed book. iPad or coffee table, your choice. Art and bacon, a delicious combination, seriously what could be better? I’ll tell you one thing that could be better? This Visual Cookbook could include one of your recipes, credited to you, for your ultimate bacon sandwich!</p><p><br/><b>Yes, 120 of the 125 recipes featured in the book can be submitted by backers of this campaign. All over the world, people have their own version of the ultimate bacon sandwich, it’s time they were compiled in one place, and also turned into an artwork while we are at it.</b></p><p><br/>Sweet! We have an art project, and we have a plan. And we also have an ulterior motive for raising money right now. Today we are in New Zealand, but in one month we want to move home. Support our campaign and help us move back to the US to set up an art studio where we can live the dream of being working artists; making, teaching and thriving, while changing the world one piece of custom art, and one Visual Cookbook, at a time.<br/></p><p><br/></p><hr/><br/><strong>Hello there!</strong><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/264822/files/20131216192731-fb600jpg?1387250851"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p>Hi, we are Helen and Lars. Helen is British, Lars is Danish, two of our kids are American and one is a Kiwi-born Brit. We are both installation artists and have been making work together under the name <a href=""http://www.tectonic-industries.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.tectonic-industries.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">tectonic industries</a> since 1999. We met at Edinburgh College of Art when we were both doing our MFA’s in Sculpture, and after one too many nights in the pub we decided to collaborate in art <em>and</em> life.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p><br/>Fast forward almost 15 years and we are still making artwork and exhibiting around the world. We now have a houseful of three little girls and a slightly increased tolerance for utter chaos and non-stop noise. Our lives have followed a path dictated by employment. From Scotland to America to New Zealand. But now? We have a new plan.</p><p><br/></p><p>*****</p><p><br/>So, this is the thing. <strong>We borrowed a dream</strong>. We found a dream, it seemed like it could work, and we went after it.</p><p><br/>A great job in New Zealand, that sounded like something we could do.  But pretty soon we realised that dreams are not interchangeable. Unfortunately, this was not our dream. But we didn’t know that for sure until we uprooted our four year old and six year old and took them and our selves and our almost-ready-to-be-born daughter all the way from America to New Zealand to start a new life in Auckland.</p><p><br/>Within six weeks we had a place to live, a car (ok, yeah a minivan, whatever, details) a cat, a new school, a new job and a new baby. We were going to make this work. It was going to work. All the upheaval, it would be worth it, because we would make it work. We tried so hard, but when something is not your dream, you can’t force it to take root. <strong>Our lives were in New Zealand, but our hearts stayed in America.</strong></p><p><br/>Within six months we were acutely aware of what we had left behind to follow this dream. After a year, we knew that it was make or break time. We could stay here and keep plugging on, one foot in front of the other. Or we could make a change, a giant, radical change, one that requires leaving the safety net that we are tangled in, and jumping absolutely into the unknown.</p><p><br/><strong>We decided to leap.</strong></p><p><br/>We are moving back to the USA in January 2014 to settle down forever and set up an art studio where we can live the dream! <em>Our </em>dream, the dream of making artwork and consciously designing a happy, creative, fulfilling life for us and our three beautiful daughters.</p><p><br/>We have been making artwork together for almost fifteen years, producing pieces for galleries and museums, but we have never set out to intentionally create artwork for people to have in their homes. Somewhere along the line we came up with this brilliant idea to make unique artworks with pride and thought and attention to detail, which people commission, love and want to have in their homes. Amazing! </p><p></p><p></p><p><br/></p><p>***</p><p><br/></p><p><b>Lately, we have started making paintings which focus on the overlap between food and art.</b> We have been translating recipes into visual diagrams, which we then paint with archival quality acrylics on canvas. </p><p>We assign ingredients a shade from a colour chart, then turn each recipe into a striped image. Each colour represents an ingredient from the recipe, and the width of each stripe represents the amount of the ingredient used in the meal, in proportion to all the other ingredients. We then paint each image. Each shade is mixed by hand from the primary colours with white and black.

We can see the stripes on menus, in interiors, and even across the outside of buildings. Imagine if you wrote a cookery book and each recipe had it’s own stripe diagram? </p><p><b>We’re so excited about making a visual cookbook, we’re creating our own dedicated entirely to the wonders of the bacon sandwich, and we need your help.</b><br/></p><p><br/></p><hr/><br/><br/><strong>HOW WILL THE BACON SANDWICH VISUAL COOKBOOK WORK?</strong><p><br/>The vast majority of the recipes to be featured in the Bacon Sandwich Visual Cookbook are going to be crowdsourced. This means that 120 of the 125 recipes will come from members of the public, be they top chefs or bacon fanatics. The first five we are reserving for our own favourite bacon sarnies, plus one from my Mum and a couple from friends with exceptional bacon sarnie good taste.</p><p><br/>Once we have all 125 recipes, we will set about making a colour scheme to be used exclusively for this project. We will compile a list of all the submitted ingredients and put them in alphabetical order. From there we will choose a colour chart with a similar amount of shades as there are ingredients, from the world of graphic design. Each ingredient will be allocated to a colour. We will then create the colour chart key for the back of the book, with each colour labelled with the corresponding ingredient.</p><p><br/>Next up, we will create stripe layouts for all 125 recipes. Each recipe will be represented by a stripe picture. Each ingredient is a colour, and the width shows how much of the ingredient is needed, relative to all the other ingredients. From there, we design the book layout, with a digital version and a paper version. Every recipe will have a title and a stripe image, with credit given to the author of the recipe. At the back of the book is the colour chart key, allowing readers to work for their bacon sarnie.</p><p><br/>The digital version of the book will be optimized for viewing on the iPad but can be viewed as a PDF on all digital devices. The print version of the book will be printed on high quality paper in gorgeous full colour. It’s a recipe book and an art book rolled into one. We are super excited about the project, we hope you are too!</p><p><br/></p><p></p><hr/><br/><br/><strong>* SO HOW CAN YOU SUBMIT A RECIPE FOR THE BACON SANDWICH VISUAL COOKBOOK?</strong><p><br/>Certain pledge levels allow you to submit a recipe for inclusion in The Bacon Sandwich Visual Cookbook. There are a limited number of spots available at the Early Bird pledge level of $150, then at every level from $250 up to $5000.</p><p><br/>Once you have made a pledge at a level which allows you to submit a recipe, we will email you with the next step. We will ask you to send us the recipe exactly as you would like it to appear, with ingredients plus amounts. The sooner you make a pledge and submit your recipe the better – there are no duplicates allowed!</p><p><br/>The criteria for a successful recipe is twofold, firstly it must include some kind of bacon and some kind of bread. Bread can be interpreted widely – pretzel, croissant, rye bread, sourdough, sandwich bread etc. The second criteria is that there can be no duplicate recipes. There can, and will, be variations on a theme, but there can be no exact duplicates. If we receive two identical recipes, the first one submitted stays and the second one will need to be tweaked. You could add tomato slices, or take away the chutney and add mustard, whatever makes sense to you. If you can’t change the recipe at all, you will be given the opportunity to submit an entirely new bacon sandwich recipe.</p><p><br/>Once we receive your recipe and approve it, we will email you to let you know and post the recipe here at the bottom of this page so no one else can choose the same recipe. We will credit your submission to you, or if you like you can remain anonymous. For reasons of fairness, we can only accept one recipe per person.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><hr/><hr/><hr/><br/><br/><strong>IN A NUTSHELL:</strong><p><br/></p><ul>

Seriously, we might be two of the world’s pickiest people. This is a terrible affliction when it comes to choosing a new coffee table, but completely brilliant when it comes to making artwork. We both started art college way back in 1993, and we continue to make and exhibit art to this day. Since starting to make work together in 1999, our motto has always been, if we don’t both agree, then it doesn’t get made. So you can rest assured that we are extremely picky about all the things that matter in a project like this – layout, print quality, colour saturation, backer satisfaction, dotting the i’s and crossing the t’s… These are all things which matter to us, enormously.</p><p><br/><b>POSTCARDS</b> will be printed on heavyweight card stock with stunning vivid colour and a gloss finish. We will choose our ten favourite designs and have them printed for the set of ten stripe postcards. These are not your average postcards, they are simply gorgeous. Everyone who backs this project at the $10 and above level will be sent a random card from the set in the mail, with a thank you message just for you.</p><p><br/><b>PRINTS</b> will be limited edition, archival quality giclee prints on beautiful thick watercolour paper. Each print will be signed and packaged wonderfully for safe transit. These prints will only ever be available for our Indiegogo backers. We will produce a set of five limited edition prints which will be revealed after all of the recipe stripe images have been created. Everyone who pledges to this campaign at a level offering prints will be contacted with the option to choose which print(s) they would prefer.</p><p><br/><b>PRINTS OF YOUR RECIPE</b> will be extremely limited edition, archival quality giclee prints on beautiful thick watercolour paper. Each print will be signed and packaged wonderfully for safe transit.</p><p><br/><b>THE PRINTED BOOK</b> will be a cross between an art book and a cook book. Expect high quality print on luxury paper, in full glorious technicolour. The books will be created by a print-on-demand company, and we’re currently researching which option gives us the most breath-takingly awesome end result.</p><p><br/><b>RECIPE PAINTINGS</b> are absolutely brilliant acrylic paintings done on canvas by us in our studio, wherever that may be. Everyone has a meal that is special to them, whether it is fish and chips or your family recipe for Christmas cake. Not everyone has their recipe translated into coloured stripes and painted by two experienced artists. No one else in the world will have a painting like you, it will make you smile and it will be the beginning of many a happy conversation. For the smallest painting (at the $500 pledge level) you will get a painting done of your bacon sandwich recipe layout. For the small, medium and large paintings ($1000, $1500 and $3000 pledge levels), you can choose to have a painting done of your submitted bacon sandwich recipe or any other recipe. For the extra-large painting ($5000 pledge level) you can choose to have your bacon sandwich recipe or a different recipe or one of the available stripe paintings from the Rachael Ray Project website. Outside of this campaign, the stripe recipe paintings retail for up to 30% more than the pledge levels here, so now is a great time to order yours!</p><p><br/></p><p><br/><b>WHEN YOU WILL GET YOUR REWARDS: </b></p><p>As soon as this fundraiser concludes, we need to get back to the US and find a space to call our own. Once we have a city to call home, we will start formatting the recipes in stripe diagrams. From there, we will prepare the digital and printed version of The Bacon Sandwich Visual Cookbook for production. As soon as we have our studio set up we will start producing The Recipe Paintings. It is our very best estimate that the digital version of the book will be emailed and all physical rewards will be in the actual mail to you by the end of March 2014. We will of course keep you updated on estimated times of arrival along the way. Recipe paintings will take a little longer but we will communicate with you regarding the time-scale of your work, and anticipate that all paintings will be done by the end of April 2014 at the latest.</p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>SHIPPING:</b></p><p>When rewards are ready to ship, we will be in the US and so will offer free shipping within the USA. If you are pledging from a country outside the US, it would be wonderful if you could add the following to your pledge to help offset the costs of shipping:</p><p></p><ul>

<p></p></div>","IT’S BACON TIME!Bacon. Bacon. Bacon! Who doesn’t love bacon? Even people who aren’t supposed to love bacon often secretly love bacon, or at least admire it from afar. The best way to eat bacon is, of course, the simplest: the bacon sandwich. We’ve decided to combine two of our passions in life, making art and making bacon sandwiches into the awesomeness that will be…The Bacon Sandwich Visual Cookbook.Not just any cookbook, these 125 recipes are presented in diagrammatic format. Essentially, each recipe looks like a bunch of stripes. Each colour signifies an ingredient, and the width of the stripe tells you how much of the ingredient you should be using. Figure it all out using the colour chart at the back of the book. Work for your bacon sandwich.Recipes in the cookbook range from ridiculously simple, your hangover-busting basic bacon sarnie, to sublimely intricate. To qualify as a bacon sandwich, each recipe must include bacon and a type of bread. Everything else is optional.The Bacon Sandwich Visual Cookbook is a cookbook and an art book. Right now, it’s in our minds, but very soon it will be a digital delight and a real live, stunning quality, printed book. iPad or coffee table, your choice. Art and bacon, a delicious combination, seriously what could be better? I’ll tell you one thing that could be better? This Visual Cookbook could include one of your recipes, credited to you, for your ultimate bacon sandwich!Yes, 120 of the 125 recipes featured in the book can be submitted by backers of this campaign. All over the world, people have their own version of the ultimate bacon sandwich, it’s time they were compiled in one place, and also turned into an artwork while we are at it.Sweet! We have an art project, and we have a plan. And we also have an ulterior motive for raising money right now. Today we are in New Zealand, but in one month we want to move home. Support our campaign and help us move back to the US to set up an art studio where we can live the dream of being working artists; making, teaching and thriving, while changing the world one piece of custom art, and one Visual Cookbook, at a time.Hello there!Hi, we are Helen and Lars. Helen is British, Lars is Danish, two of our kids are American and one is a Kiwi-born Brit. We are both installation artists and have been making work together under the name tectonic industries since 1999. We met at Edinburgh College of Art when we were both doing our MFA’s in Sculpture, and after one too many nights in the pub we decided to collaborate in art and life.Fast forward almost 15 years and we are still making artwork and exhibiting around the world. We now have a houseful of three little girls and a slightly increased tolerance for utter chaos and non-stop noise. Our lives have followed a path dictated by employment. From Scotland to America to New Zealand. But now? We have a new plan.*****So, this is the thing. We borrowed a dream. We found a dream, it seemed like it could work, and we went after it.A great job in New Zealand, that sounded like something we could do.  But pretty soon we realised that dreams are not interchangeable. Unfortunately, this was not our dream. But we didn’t know that for sure until we uprooted our four year old and six year old and took them and our selves and our almost-ready-to-be-born daughter all the way from America to New Zealand to start a new life in Auckland.Within six weeks we had a place to live, a car (ok, yeah a minivan, whatever, details) a cat, a new school, a new job and a new baby. We were going to make this work. It was going to work. All the upheaval, it would be worth it, because we would make it work. We tried so hard, but when something is not your dream, you can’t force it to take root. Our lives were in New Zealand, but our hearts stayed in America.Within six months we were acutely aware of what we had left behind to follow this dream. After a year, we knew that it was make or break time. We could stay here and keep plugging on, one foot in front of the other. Or we could make a change, a giant, radical change, one that requires leaving the safety net that we are tangled in, and jumping absolutely into the unknown.We decided to leap.We are moving back to the USA in January 2014 to settle down forever and set up an art studio where we can live the dream! Our dream, the dream of making artwork and consciously designing a happy, creative, fulfilling life for us and our three beautiful daughters.We have been making artwork together for almost fifteen years, producing pieces for galleries and museums, but we have never set out to intentionally create artwork for people to have in their homes. Somewhere along the line we came up with this brilliant idea to make unique artworks with pride and thought and attention to detail, which people commission, love and want to have in their homes. Amazing! ***Lately, we have started making paintings which focus on the overlap between food and art. We have been translating recipes into visual diagrams, which we then paint with archival quality acrylics on canvas. We assign ingredients a shade from a colour chart, then turn each recipe into a striped image. Each colour represents an ingredient from the recipe, and the width of each stripe represents the amount of the ingredient used in the meal, in proportion to all the other ingredients. We then paint each image. Each shade is mixed by hand from the primary colours with white and black. The process of painting this way is reminiscent of cooking, a dash of red, a little more yellow, a touch of blue…Initially, we made recipe painting layouts from every single recipe in Rachael Ray's book, 365 No Repeats: A Year of Deliciously Different Dinners, at the The Rachael Ray Project. We had previously cooked our way through the book, while blogging about it, over the course of a year, so it seemed a fitting way to bring the art project full circle. However, we wanted to create a system where anyone could commission a painting of their favourite or most poignant meal so we created The Recipe Painting Project. Everyone has a meal that means something to them, perhaps an old family recipe or the meal you ate night after night when you were a student, or the meal you had on a first date or just your ultimate comfort food.  We have created a massive database of almost two thousand ingredients, and assigned each one a shade from a Pantone colour chart. We have room to add in any ingredients that were overlooked or are super rare, so we can make a recipe painting of any meal. From beans on toast to a nine-course extravaganza, anything is possible! Each and every painting is unique and each one tells a story.At the heart of this idea is the notion that each painting becomes a collaboration between the food lover and the artists. We work together to bring your meal to life in a completely different medium, so that you can constantly be reminded of the taste, smell, ritual and process of cooking, eating and enjoying the meal. Plus, you have a gorgeous piece of custom artwork to brighten your room and your life. It’s yours, from your recipe, and it’s unlike anything else in the world.Our dream is to create recipe paintings to make people think and smile in houses and restaurants across the world. We can see the stripes on menus, in interiors, and even across the outside of buildings. Imagine if you wrote a cookery book and each recipe had it’s own stripe diagram? We’re so excited about making a visual cookbook, we’re creating our own dedicated entirely to the wonders of the bacon sandwich, and we need your help.HOW WILL THE BACON SANDWICH VISUAL COOKBOOK WORK?The vast majority of the recipes to be featured in the Bacon Sandwich Visual Cookbook are going to be crowdsourced. This means that 120 of the 125 recipes will come from members of the public, be they top chefs or bacon fanatics. The first five we are reserving for our own favourite bacon sarnies, plus one from my Mum and a couple from friends with exceptional bacon sarnie good taste.Once we have all 125 recipes, we will set about making a colour scheme to be used exclusively for this project. We will compile a list of all the submitted ingredients and put them in alphabetical order. From there we will choose a colour chart with a similar amount of shades as there are ingredients, from the world of graphic design. Each ingredient will be allocated to a colour. We will then create the colour chart key for the back of the book, with each colour labelled with the corresponding ingredient.Next up, we will create stripe layouts for all 125 recipes. Each recipe will be represented by a stripe picture. Each ingredient is a colour, and the width shows how much of the ingredient is needed, relative to all the other ingredients. From there, we design the book layout, with a digital version and a paper version. Every recipe will have a title and a stripe image, with credit given to the author of the recipe. At the back of the book is the colour chart key, allowing readers to work for their bacon sarnie.The digital version of the book will be optimized for viewing on the iPad but can be viewed as a PDF on all digital devices. The print version of the book will be printed on high quality paper in gorgeous full colour. It’s a recipe book and an art book rolled into one. We are super excited about the project, we hope you are too!* SO HOW CAN YOU SUBMIT A RECIPE FOR THE BACON SANDWICH VISUAL COOKBOOK?Certain pledge levels allow you to submit a recipe for inclusion in The Bacon Sandwich Visual Cookbook. There are a limited number of spots available at the Early Bird pledge level of $150, then at every level from $250 up to $5000.Once you have made a pledge at a level which allows you to submit a recipe, we will email you with the next step. We will ask you to send us the recipe exactly as you would like it to appear, with ingredients plus amounts. The sooner you make a pledge and submit your recipe the better – there are no duplicates allowed!The criteria for a successful recipe is twofold, firstly it must include some kind of bacon and some kind of bread. Bread can be interpreted widely – pretzel, croissant, rye bread, sourdough, sandwich bread etc. The second criteria is that there can be no duplicate recipes. There can, and will, be variations on a theme, but there can be no exact duplicates. If we receive two identical recipes, the first one submitted stays and the second one will need to be tweaked. You could add tomato slices, or take away the chutney and add mustard, whatever makes sense to you. If you can’t change the recipe at all, you will be given the opportunity to submit an entirely new bacon sandwich recipe.Once we receive your recipe and approve it, we will email you to let you know and post the recipe here at the bottom of this page so no one else can choose the same recipe. We will credit your submission to you, or if you like you can remain anonymous. For reasons of fairness, we can only accept one recipe per person.IN A NUTSHELL:
We are making The Bacon Sandwich Visual Cookbook, in both digital and fancy-pants printed versions. You will be able to get your hands on this art-cookbook hybrid, and even contribute a recipe to the publication. Sweet! 

We will be mailing thank-you postcards to your door and sending out postcard sets and limited edition, archival-quality prints, all created and available exclusively for this Indiegogo campaign. 


For some super lucky peeps we will be painting recipe paintings and for a select few we will be painting really giant recipe paintings. 


Your job, if you feel inspired to contribute, is to pick a pledge level and await the awesome. 


Our job is to keep in touch with our fabulous backers, move half way round the world again, set up a studio, finish the cookbook, make your rewards, and be profoundly grateful and delighted with every single donation, no matter the size. 

WE'RE UP FOR IT.  ARE YOU?!WHAT WE NEED & WHAT YOU GET:OK folks, this is where we break it down.WHAT WE NEED:Initially we are looking to raise our airfares back to the USA. There are five of us, and flights from New Zealand are not exactly cheap.For airfares we need to raise $8500 US Dollars.As soon as we have found somewhere to live, we need to set up a studio. This will probably be a room in our house, with a plan to rent a space outside our home at some point down the line. We are pretty much starting from scratch again so we will need to purchase basic furniture, a printer, art supplies including canvases and paint, and a Mac to replace the “work computer”. As soon as we have a space we will set to work on this project, to develop the digital book and also print the book on paper. To turbocharge the studio setup + production work on The Bacon Sandwich Visual Cookbook, we are looking to raise $5,500. So, our total goal is $14,000 US DollarsTHE FUNDING:We are setting this campaign up as flexible funding which means that even if we don’t quite meet our goal, we will still receive everyone’s generous donation. We have chosen to do this because we are going back to the US come hell or high water and every single penny will help. Seriously, it all counts and we are tremendously grateful for every single donation no matter the size.WHAT YOU GET: Aside from the sweet glow of satisfaction that you’re changing lives, you will get some pretty sweet original artwork to call your own. We are offering great perks at every level. For each level you get your name on the Thank You Wall of Gratitude and all pledges over $5 get access to private Indiegogo-supporters-only posts at our new blog, Designing a Happy*Life.FOR PLEDGE DETAILS + PERKS PLEASE SEE THE COLUMN ON THE RIGHT[*All submitted recipes must consist of bacon + bread, and must not be duplicates of already submitted recipes.]***   GIFTING A PLEDGE?   ***Shopping for that person who is almost impossible to buy for? Running out of time? Why not support The Bacon Sandwich Visual Cookbook project IN THEIR NAME as the most amazing gift?? They will get their name on the Thank You Wall of Gratitute (if you like) plus they'll get some amazing perks. Where else can you get your recipe in a cookbook as a present? Nowhere else, that's where!!Choose your pledge level and make a donation at the correct amount. After you have completed the payment process, you will be able to change the visibility status of your pledge and credit it to another name (more details here).When your pledge comes through, we will send your lucky recipient a beautiful emailed gift card telling them that you have pledged in their name, and what they will be receiving for their gift in the New Year (delayed gratification is the best, something to look forward to once all the festivities are over!)GOOD FOR THEM + GOOD FOR YOU!!For every pledge over $25 gifted to a friend, you will get a giftee too! * If you gift-pledge over $25 your friend will get the perks and the glory, and you'll get a digital copy of The Bacon Sandwich Visual Cookbook when it is released.* If you gift-pledge over $100 your friend will get the perks and the glory, and you'll get a limited edition archival print + a digital copy of The Bacon Sandwich Visual Cookbook when it is released.* If you gift-pledge over $3000 your friend will get the perks and the glory, and you'll get a 15cm x 20cm custom recipe painting + a limited edition archival print + a digital copy of The Bacon Sandwich Visual Cookbook when it is released.ALL ABOUT THE REWARDS: We are all about quality. Seriously, we might be two of the world’s pickiest people. This is a terrible affliction when it comes to choosing a new coffee table, but completely brilliant when it comes to making artwork. We both started art college way back in 1993, and we continue to make and exhibit art to this day. Since starting to make work together in 1999, our motto has always been, if we don’t both agree, then it doesn’t get made. So you can rest assured that we are extremely picky about all the things that matter in a project like this – layout, print quality, colour saturation, backer satisfaction, dotting the i’s and crossing the t’s… These are all things which matter to us, enormously.POSTCARDS will be printed on heavyweight card stock with stunning vivid colour and a gloss finish. We will choose our ten favourite designs and have them printed for the set of ten stripe postcards. These are not your average postcards, they are simply gorgeous. Everyone who backs this project at the $10 and above level will be sent a random card from the set in the mail, with a thank you message just for you.PRINTS will be limited edition, archival quality giclee prints on beautiful thick watercolour paper. Each print will be signed and packaged wonderfully for safe transit. These prints will only ever be available for our Indiegogo backers. We will produce a set of five limited edition prints which will be revealed after all of the recipe stripe images have been created. Everyone who pledges to this campaign at a level offering prints will be contacted with the option to choose which print(s) they would prefer.PRINTS OF YOUR RECIPE will be extremely limited edition, archival quality giclee prints on beautiful thick watercolour paper. Each print will be signed and packaged wonderfully for safe transit.THE PRINTED BOOK will be a cross between an art book and a cook book. Expect high quality print on luxury paper, in full glorious technicolour. The books will be created by a print-on-demand company, and we’re currently researching which option gives us the most breath-takingly awesome end result.RECIPE PAINTINGS are absolutely brilliant acrylic paintings done on canvas by us in our studio, wherever that may be. Everyone has a meal that is special to them, whether it is fish and chips or your family recipe for Christmas cake. Not everyone has their recipe translated into coloured stripes and painted by two experienced artists. No one else in the world will have a painting like you, it will make you smile and it will be the beginning of many a happy conversation. For the smallest painting (at the $500 pledge level) you will get a painting done of your bacon sandwich recipe layout. For the small, medium and large paintings ($1000, $1500 and $3000 pledge levels), you can choose to have a painting done of your submitted bacon sandwich recipe or any other recipe. For the extra-large painting ($5000 pledge level) you can choose to have your bacon sandwich recipe or a different recipe or one of the available stripe paintings from the Rachael Ray Project website. Outside of this campaign, the stripe recipe paintings retail for up to 30% more than the pledge levels here, so now is a great time to order yours!WHEN YOU WILL GET YOUR REWARDS: As soon as this fundraiser concludes, we need to get back to the US and find a space to call our own. Once we have a city to call home, we will start formatting the recipes in stripe diagrams. From there, we will prepare the digital and printed version of The Bacon Sandwich Visual Cookbook for production. As soon as we have our studio set up we will start producing The Recipe Paintings. It is our very best estimate that the digital version of the book will be emailed and all physical rewards will be in the actual mail to you by the end of March 2014. We will of course keep you updated on estimated times of arrival along the way. Recipe paintings will take a little longer but we will communicate with you regarding the time-scale of your work, and anticipate that all paintings will be done by the end of April 2014 at the latest.SHIPPING:When rewards are ready to ship, we will be in the US and so will offer free shipping within the USA. If you are pledging from a country outside the US, it would be wonderful if you could add the following to your pledge to help offset the costs of shipping:
$10 - Please add $1

WHY CONTRIBUTING TO THIS CAMPAIGN IS IMPORTANT:By contributing to this campaign, you will get us back to the US so that we can set up our lives as working artists. We have so much to give the world, so much artwork to make, and so many lives that we can change by making people pause, think and smile. We believe in the power of changing the world with beautiful, thoughtful artwork which can change your day for the better.We actually can’t make this work without your help, which is why we are asking for your contribution today.

If you’ve ever had a dream and the beginnings of a plan, please consider helping us to navigate this new path. We need a financial boost to get this underway, our airfares are a really essential part of getting back;  without them, we’re literally stranded. In return, you will get some amazing perks, our never-ending gratitude, and the satisfaction of knowing that you really are helping to change the world, starting right here with one immensely grateful family.OTHER WAYS TO HELP:We know that not everyone can contribute financially, but we would still really truly appreciate your assistance. Please help spread the word about this campaign, so other people can get in on the bacon cookbook action and possibly commission a recipe painting of their very own.

</p><p>Safiyatou, owner of Super Fly Hair Boutique, is renowned nationally
and internationally for producing, coordinating, and being featured in the hair
and fashion industry for many years.  Her
phenomenal work has garnered her being recognized by Essence Magazine as one of
the 50 top Hair Colorists in the nation. 
From the Golden Scissors events, to Harlem Fashion Week, to the islands
of the Carribbean, Safiyatou’s award winning work has wowed audiences and put
her in demand with numerous high profile clients.  In the past, she has used her talents to
raise money for breast cancer research. Her current 2014 project is called
“BaltimoreGirls” Hair Exhibition.  It is
an art collection showcasing photography and life sculpture from an eclectic
group of Maryland women of varied backgrounds and social strata.  It will highlight the work of Safiyatou and
some of Baltimore’s elite designers,performing artists and photographers. Safiyatou's own personal challenges including renal failure, which many may not know of, created a passion in her for increasing an awareness of the challenges women around the globe face and maintain so well no one would ever imagine!  A portion of the proceeds will benefit the
National Kidney Foundation (NKF).  The
National Kidney Foundation is the leading organization in the United States
dedicated to the awareness, prevention and treatment of kidney disease for
hundreds of thousands of healthcare professionals, millions of patients and
their families, and the millions of Americans at risk.  </p>
<p>“BaltimoreGirls” is an anthology of the lives of
approximately 7 women and their life experiences attempting to overcome many
of the obstacles that women living in Baltimore face.  Each woman has a story dealing with
loneliness, isolation, fear, self-esteem, family, suicidal thoughts, seeking
love, identity, abandonment, choices, coming out, pregnancy, and pursuit of
happiness – embodied by every woman’s tale. 
They are the stories of real people finding their own beauty and
identity and creating their own sense of self-empowerment and social
development.  “BaltimoreGirls” is
designed to educate and inspire those seeking to overcome obstacles in their
own lives.  This thought provoking array
of works will have you amazed and wanting more. 
</p>
<p>The “Baltimore Girls” Exhibition is intended to become a
travelling art collection and will tour venues locally and throughout the

<p>Promoting diversity and harmony through the arts by bringing together a multidisciplinary selection of socially excluded artists, the <strong>OUROBOROS</strong> exhibition is a week exploring the relationship between creation/destruction and art/austerity.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the excluded, these artists with experiences of homelessness, being differently abled, addiction, sex work are working to generate dialogue about the current world crisis through visual art and performance.</p>
<p>Collectively,we believe art can help us to know and to tackle these overwhelming issues.</p>
<p>The exhibition aims for as diverse an audience as the artists, accessible for the Deaf, visually impaired, and socially excluded, creating a model of social cohesion through the arts.</p>
<p>The artworks and performances are geared towards a commentary on social as well as personal issues. We hope to highlight the connection between the two states, and together empower ourselves to create the personal and world vision we desire.</p>

<p>We collaborate with socially excluded artists to develop their experience and resume to allow them greater access to society and fulfilling their desires in the future.</p>
<p>We strive to create a harmonious, multicultural society where healthy and empassioned debate and dialogue can take place between diverse groups of people,</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>We believe art is a powerful tool for this.</strong></p>

WTF is the OUROBOROS?
 
(oura) ""tail"" (boros) ""eating"". The snake eating its own tail - destroying its own world, trapped in its own greediness whilst simultaneously giving birth to itself.
 
“The living being had no need of eyes because there was nothing outside of him to be seen; nor of ears because there was nothing to be heard; and there was no surrounding atmosphere to be breathed; nor would there have been any use of organs by the help of which he might receive his food or get rid of what he had already digested, since there was nothing which went from him or came into him: for there was nothing beside him. Of design he created thus; his own waste providing his own food, and all that he did or suffered taking place in and by himself.
 
For the Creator conceived that a being which was self-sufficient would be far more excellent than one which lacked anything …”
 
- Plato
 

 
That isn't much clearer ...
 
Promoting diversity and harmony through the arts by bringing together a multidisciplinary selection of socially excluded artists, the OUROBOROS exhibition is a week exploring the relationship between creation/destruction and art/austerity.
From the perspective of the excluded, these artists with experiences of homelessness, being differently abled, addiction, sex work are working to generate dialogue about the current world crisis through visual art and performance.
Collectively,we believe art can help us to know and to tackle these overwhelming issues.
The exhibition aims for as diverse an audience as the artists, accessible for the Deaf, visually impaired, and socially excluded, creating a model of social cohesion through the arts.
The artworks and performances are geared towards a commentary on social as well as personal issues. We hope to highlight the connection between the two states, and together empower ourselves to create the personal and world vision we desire.
 

 
But who the hell are you people?
 
OUROBOROS is entirely run by a volunteer collective that aspires to create multicultural harmony and empower dialogue for social and personal transformation through the arts.
We use performances, exhibitions and workshops to support people who are denied their right to full, happy and active participation in society.
We collaborate with socially excluded artists to develop their experience and resume to allow them greater access to society and fulfilling their desires in the future.
We strive to create a harmonious, multicultural society where healthy and empassioned debate and dialogue can take place between diverse groups of people,
We believe art is a powerful tool for this.
It is fundamental to create bridges between the parallel worlds of the mainstream and the underground for discussion to take place upon, and the intention of OUROBOROS to do just that.
 


 
And you need £5000 to do this?
Through the generous support of our partner organisations and a grant from the Arts Council, we have covered our core costs, and the OUROBOROS is alive.
We want the events to be free for everyone and accessible for all.
At the moment, our budget requires that we have to ask for £10 for each person for our performance events NOISE CORRUPTION & THE CIRCUS RIOT.
We believe that art is for everyone, and that everyone can be an artist.
For every extra pound we raise here, we can give more tickets away to people normally excluded from galleries and performance events, creating a diverse and inclusive mixture of participants.
 
The Targets
£1000
We will be able to give 50 per night away tickets to persons from socially excluded groups
£2500
When we confirm this amount, we will be able to reduce the entry cost from £10 to £5 for both events!
£4000
With your love and support, meeting this target would allow us to distribute 100 tickets a night for free, and reduce the cost of entry to only £3
£5000
If we reach our crowdfunding target, then entry for both events will be free for all, with a minimum of 50% of the spaces distributed to socially-excluded groups
 
We wish OUROBOROS to be free to everyone, regardless of their economic background, and to cost no expense for the artists involved, as accessibility and inclusion are our primary objectives.
Your support can help make this possible.
 

 
Join us and help us to create a model of the world where socially-engaged artists from diverse and oppressed backgrounds are supported and included in a dialogue about our future.
Contribute now, and you can choose from our range of perks, including reserving spaces to the performance events and limited edition customised pieces created by our artists.
It's no joke that without support our artists literally will be struggling to feed, clothe and shelter themselves.
We need your support to honour the work and struggle of the artists' during their time in one of the most expensive cities in Europe.
Whether we raise that amount or not - we will not stop. We will channel all our energies and finances into continuing to critique, destroy and rebirth the world through our artworks and actions. OUROBOROS is the beginning and the end, and whatever we have we will direct into sustained and meaningful social and personal transformation through the arts.

With these funds, I will be able to purchase backdrops for portraits, posing stools and benches, curtains to cover and diffuse the window light, basic photo equipment for renters, as well as other furnishings for the dressing and waiting areas. Your donation will go towards making this studio a productive photostudio. Here are some of the items needed…Commercial set of black-out curtains - colored backdrops + holders - 2 large storage racks-sink - posing stools, benches & desks - photography light stands - mirrors - small couch - rugs - storage cabinets -  coffee table - make-up table, etc.Why support photography? Photography is an important tool for visual communication, personal expression and awareness. Photographs create authentic reflections of our humanity and remind us of the miracle of life. Studio portraiture is especially unique because it creates a comfortable environment to share important life moments and personal truths. Risks & ChallengesLiving one's dreams takes courage. It feels risky to bet on my abilities and potential, yet it is through believing in myself that I have evolved into the professional woman I am. I know that the work is not just in the action steps, but also in my ability to receive and feel worthy of living my dream. I feel challenged by the many tasks I have to complete, but welcome this process as an opportunity to learn, grow, and be an empowered woman, artist, and community member. I believe that showing-up, learning new skills, and confronting what scares me is the way to live a wholehearted, happy life.For your support I wanted all the rewards to not only gift you for your generosity, but also give some of you an opportunity to experience a photo shoot in the new studio space. These gifts are my way of sharing my passion for photography and thanking you for helping me realize my dream. Check out these wonderful perks below.Donation Perks$15  - Thank you note$25 - Photo card & Thank you (5x7)$50 - Photo print (5x5) & Thank you $75 - Photography print (8x10) & Thank-you card$100 – Photography print (11X14)$200 – 4 square prints + photo print (11x14)$200 – Photography session ~$250 valueIncludes up to two hours in the studio w/ 10 digital photo files for download.

My work will be shown as part of 'Personal Structures'  for a six-month period from 9 May through to 23 November 2019 with an anticipated audience of  more than half a million.</p>
<p><strong>I need to raise a minimum 15,000 Euro to cover my share of the participation fee. </strong></p>
<p>Entry to the exhibition will be free to visitors, and I hope many supporters will be able to visit. As a more immediate thank you I have created a selection of rewards. These range from postcards to original paintings made especially for this occasion.</p>

<h3>What is Emerging Artists Zine?</h3>
<p>Emerging Artists Zine (EAZ) is a zine dedicated to giving first-timers in the zine community the chance to shine. Each volume is a different theme. The theme for this volume is Witching Hour: witches, wizards, and all things magical.</p>
<ul>
<li>Witching Hour is run by a team of 5 zine mods with varying levels of experience from newbies to veterans. All of us are passionate about zines and are so excited to release this beautiful book to the world.</li>
<li>Each one of us believes that every talented artist deserves the chance to be in a zine if they want to be. </li>
<li>By supporting EAZ, you're supporting each and every emerging artist involved!</li>
<li>To view the list of contributors for Witching Hour, please see here: <a href=""https://emerging-artists-zine.tumblr.com/post/175519412516/gather-round-our-cauldron-all-and-see-what-were"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Contributor List</a> <br/>(please note, 3 of the people on that list have since dropped out).</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Zine Specifications and Funds</h3>
<p>Each digital and physical copy of the zine comes with 40+ original pieces of beautiful witch-and-wizard themed artwork from 35+ extremely talented new artists breaking into the zine community.</p>
<p>Zine specifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>8.5""x11"" (US Letter sized)</li>
<li>Perfect bound</li>
<li>Soft cover</li>
<li>Around 60 pages total, give or take a few pages</li>
</ul>
<p>Our goal is to receive enough funding to cover physical production costs of the zine, and to be able to provide each amazing and hard-working contributor with their compensation of a physical zine free of charge.</p>
<p>Each penny received from the zine will go towards these things: </p>
<ul>
<li>Physical zine printing and production costs</li>
<li>Shipping costs and supplies</li>
<li>Platform fees</li>
<li>Applicable taxes</li>
<li>Our chosen charity: Pencils of Promise</li>
</ul>
<p>If the project is not fully funded, we unfortunately will not be able to produce physical copies of the zine. In the case that the project is not funded, backers of the physical zine will receive:</p>
<ul>
<li>A partial refund for the cost difference between physical vs. digital zine  ($10+shipping refund for the Merlin Bundle, $15+shipping refund for the Morgana Bundle)</li>
<li>A digital PDF copy of the zine</li>
</ul>
<p>If the physical zine is not funded, ALL profits from the zine will go towards our charity, Pencils of Promise.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our chosen charity: Pencils of Promise</h3>
<p>As stated above, all the profits (after production costs) will go towards Pencils of Promise. Pencils of Promise is a charity organization that builds schools and funds education in Ghana, Guatemala, and Laos. So for backing this project, not only will you receive a gorgeous zine, but you will also be able to say that you contributed to a good cause.</p>
<p>For more information about Pencils of Promise, please visit their website: <a href=""https://pencilsofpromise.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://pencilsofpromise.org/</a></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Next Step (after the campaign is finished)</h3>
<p>If the zine campaign is fully funded, we will move forward with these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will order first physical proofs of the zine from our printer. Once that is approved, we will proceed with printing and shipping.</li>
<li>All of the physical zines will be shipped to one of the mods, where they will be packaged and shipped.</li>
<li>We are aiming to have all packages shipped sometime in December or hopefully, maybe even earlier than that!</li>
<li>PDF orders will be sent via email around when people would be receiving their physical zines.</li>
<li>We will calculate how much is leftover after production costs and give the rest of the proceeds made to charity.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the zine campaign is NOT fully funded, we will move forward with these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will issue partial refunds to those who backed the physical zine perks (Morgana or Merlin bundles).</li>
<li>PDF zine will be sent out as soon as all refunds have been processed. </li>
<li>We will give all proceeds from the campaign to charity, with none going to production (since the physical zine will not be made).</li>
</ul>
<p>After the first round of everything has been distributed, we are considering doing a 2nd round of PDF sales. However, we have no plans currently to do another round of physical sales for the zine so get the physical zine while you can!</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are unable to support the zine by buying a bundle but you still want to contribute, there are other ways you can support us!</p>
<ul>
<li>Share our campaign with anyone and everyone you know that you think would be interested. Word of mouth does wonders!</li>
<li>Support independent artists by sharing their work - reblogging, retweeting, and showing your friends their work is the best way to support non-monetarily. Let your favorite artists know how much you love their work by commenting once in a while (even if they don't respond, they appreciate every positive comment received)!</li>
<li>Consider donating even a small amount to Pencils of Promise - every dollar counts!</li>

<p><strong>What We Are Doing</strong></p>
<p>Magnificent Revolution has been invited by Orbis Institute in Slovakia to travel over and upgrade their pedal power system.  We thought we should use this opportunity to take pedal power to other countries and hold off grid bike powered events and workshops along the way.</p>
<p>In 2012 we will work with artists Holland, Austria, Germany before delivering the enormous 20-bike generator to our pedal power friends in Slovakia.  This follows on from our adventures in 2011, when we worked in Hong Kong building a 4-bike generator kit and toured pedal powered cinema around the city.  We left 4 generators with 4 enthusiastic groups there to do their own off grid events.</p>

   This tiny and unique publishing house will specialize in small-run 
art books, comics and zines. In the DIY vein of things, I've been 
creating thousands of copies of work, on an extremely ""scrappy"" budget 
for a long time now. I'm beginning this campaign to gather funds to buy 
necessary supplies (a better paper-cutter, folding machine, heavy duty 
stapler, binding equipment) and WHOA! possibly even a newer and better 
operating duplicator. Besides the printing, everything I do- from 
collating, stapling, folding and hole punching- is done by hand. This is
 a very laborious and time consuming labor of love that can be hard on 
the body, but I’m hoping to remedy that a bit with some helpful 
supplies. </span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-right: 3pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;""><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"">   For over a decade, I've made zines and have regularly had my work printed and shown in galleries. </span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"">PEGACORN PRESS</span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"">
 has been a long time in the making and is informed directly from the 
DIY punk, queer, feminist, art world that I live and engage in. In 2009,
 I bought my first Risograph duplicator, which is a machine that looks 
very much like a copier, but technologically speaking, is one step up 
from a mimeograph. A high speed machine, a Risograph can print between 
60-120 prints per minute. Essentially, the process is similar to 
screen-printing, except done automatically and all within a relatively 
small machine.  </span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-right: 3pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;""><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"">
   Different colored inks can be used in dedicated color drums, but due 
to the fact that my machine is older, quality issues usually start to 
come up after two colors are printed. At this point, it’s easier to use 
my machine for strictly one color jobs, though the option to use black, 
red, burgandy, purple or blue ink is there. Ideally, I wouldn't have 
problems, but considering that this beast of a machine is from the early
 1980's (and has made over 2.5 million copies), it's hard to complain 
since it’s made it this far and is still working. While I’ll keep 
working this Risograph til it breaks down for good (said with fingers 
crossed since that’s all I have to work with right now...), a better 
working machine would definitely be helpful and would be the “big” 
purchase of this fundraising. Even if the goal isn’t met, donations will
 definitely help obtain any, or even all, of the smaller items needed to
 put everything together without breaking my back any more than it 
already is! </span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-right: 3pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;""><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"">   </span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-right: 3pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;""><span style=""font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"">COMING UP THIS FALL...</span></p><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;""></span><br/><p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-right: 3pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;""><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"">

 likely to have their work published. Women and queers are noticeably 
absent from this world and I’d like to change that as much as I can 
through not only art, but the art of dissemination. From
 my own experiences, I know that many projects are started, but never 
make it to the printer due to finances, time and other circumstances.

I'm Caroline Paquita,
 a visual artist, musician, bee-keeper, and in general, a maker and 
“sharer” of things. I live and work out of Port Quincy, in Brooklyn, NY.
 After many years of self-publishing, I'm officially beginning a small 
queer, feminist, total-art-freaker publishing house called PEGACORN PRESS. Through your help, I’m hoping to raise funds for new and better equipment to make this easier and all the more possible. 
   This tiny and unique publishing house will specialize in small-run 
art books, comics and zines. In the DIY vein of things, I've been 
creating thousands of copies of work, on an extremely ""scrappy"" budget 
for a long time now. I'm beginning this campaign to gather funds to buy 
necessary supplies (a better paper-cutter, folding machine, heavy duty 
stapler, binding equipment) and WHOA! possibly even a newer and better 
operating duplicator. Besides the printing, everything I do- from 
collating, stapling, folding and hole punching- is done by hand. This is
 a very laborious and time consuming labor of love that can be hard on 
the body, but I’m hoping to remedy that a bit with some helpful 
supplies.    For over a decade, I've made zines and have regularly had my work printed and shown in galleries. PEGACORN PRESS
 has been a long time in the making and is informed directly from the 
DIY punk, queer, feminist, art world that I live and engage in. In 2009,
 I bought my first Risograph duplicator, which is a machine that looks 
very much like a copier, but technologically speaking, is one step up 
from a mimeograph. A high speed machine, a Risograph can print between 
60-120 prints per minute. Essentially, the process is similar to 
screen-printing, except done automatically and all within a relatively 
small machine.  
   Different colored inks can be used in dedicated color drums, but due 
to the fact that my machine is older, quality issues usually start to 
come up after two colors are printed. At this point, it’s easier to use 
my machine for strictly one color jobs, though the option to use black, 
red, burgandy, purple or blue ink is there. Ideally, I wouldn't have 
problems, but considering that this beast of a machine is from the early
 1980's (and has made over 2.5 million copies), it's hard to complain 
since it’s made it this far and is still working. While I’ll keep 
working this Risograph til it breaks down for good (said with fingers 
crossed since that’s all I have to work with right now...), a better 
working machine would definitely be helpful and would be the “big” 
purchase of this fundraising. Even if the goal isn’t met, donations will
 definitely help obtain any, or even all, of the smaller items needed to
 put everything together without breaking my back any more than it 
already is!    COMING UP THIS FALL...
   Recently, I was awarded an artist's residency in Halifax, Nova Scotia
 at the Roberts Street Social Centre. Based on my proposal for a “Punk 
Health” zine and for the necessary time to work on the second issue of 
WOMANIMALISTIC (a comic-zine), I’ll be heading up there in October to 
live in a “rustic” shack behind the bustling RSSC, which also houses the
 Anchor Archive Zine Library. The third and upcoming 2012 Paquita calendar, 
as well as the comic compilation (assuming that all the contributors get
 their stuff in by the deadline!) will be printed in time to take to 
Halifax. A big zine conference and a music festival will be happening 
when I’m there, so all around it’s a great opportunity for not only my 
own artistic practice, but to share PEGACORN PRESS with a larger 
audience. Prior to leaving for all this excitement in Nova Scotia, a New
 York release party is being planned to celebrate all the new projects 
coming out. Last year a friend and I had a dual-release party (for the 
2011 Calendar, WOMANIMALISTIC and his zine, Slice Harvester) at The City
 Reliquary, which was a well received and successful event. THE IMPACT...   With PEGACORN PRESS, the
 hope is that any funds raised from projects printed, will help fuel the
 next one in line (and/or purchase other helpful equipment), in order to
 help expand the press and it’s capabilities. The plan isn’t to have a 
huge operation or distribution going (I plan on keeping my “real-world” 
jobs), but to infrequently publish- two to four times a year- works that
 are interesting, inspiring and need to see the light of day.
   I live in a world surrounded by other artists who make incredibly 
beautiful, intelligent and amazingly funny work that the world deserves 
to see more of. I've found that more often than not, people who lead 
""unconventional lifestyles"" and who have more radical politics, are less
 likely to have their work published. Women and queers are noticeably 
absent from this world and I’d like to change that as much as I can 
through not only art, but the art of dissemination. From
 my own experiences, I know that many projects are started, but never 
make it to the printer due to finances, time and other circumstances. 
I'd like to help create an environment where artists are able to have 
the luxury to make work that will get printed and done so in a creative 
way.   Currently, I keep an Etsy store and also sell to small bookstores around the country. Publications out on PEGACORN PRESS
 will also be sold online, in stores, have release parties, and possibly
 small tours to promote their existence. As someone who has been 
involved with a collectively run non-profit, and has booked, toured, and
 sold my own work around the world, I feel confident that what gets 
printed, will actually get out on the streets. I want people to be 
inspired and to learn from other folks, not only through the written 
word, but through art! To be able to share the resources, as well as 
learn some new processes along the way is the root of this campaign.

<h3><font>Our Story</font></h3>
<p>Almost a year ago, my career brought me to Newark, New Jersey. It was then I was introduced to the idea of a Newark School. The Newark School is a population of artists whose work is primarily informed by its environment - with a great deal if these artists being self-taught.  As an arts administrator, artist, and cultural researcher I have become enamored by the rich history among the Black artist community in Newark.  What I find most intriguing about this community of artists is its close proximity to New York City, yet its ability to maintain its own identity and unique way of sustaining itself.  I have had many informal conversations about the history of Black artists in Newark which has guided me to dig deeper and archive these legacies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Because of the warmth, I've received from this  community; I'm embarking on an oral history project, The Newark Black Artists (NBA) Oral History Project, that pays homage to such rich legacies.  This oral history project will chronicle each personality each journey, and each  contribution of the Black visual artists in Newark.</p>

<h3><strong>Hello!  My name is Coral and I am an artist/designer with a small business called Squared Array.  I make fun, unique and versatile modern designs for the home and office.  I have been doing well in sales recently and am looking to further expand my business and artistic skillsets.  I heard about the Camp which is a 4 day and 3 night workshop in Big Bear, CA that is a gathering of like-minded creators and small business owners in the arts. </strong></h3>
<p>This is of great importance to me as growing a small business in the handmade art industry is challenging.  I am hoping to find local small business support resources within the art community, build relationships that lead to potential artistic collaborations, and learn some new creative skillsets at the Camp conference.  This is also part of my business 3-5 year plan.  I had expected to pay for this myself but I have had to invest in my business recently in order to produce a large amount of orders that came in from a few websites that my pieces were on - this is a good thing of course.  However, it will take a few months before I make that money back and by then the conference I am hoping to attend will be over. </p>
</div>
<p>The funding I am requesting will go to Camp registration which is $1,200.  This covers the following:</p>
<p>- new ideas</p>
<p>- hands-on workshops and classes</p>
<p>- key note speakers from the industry</p>
<p>- food/room and board</p>
<p>- networking with like minded peers</p>
<p>- leadership skills</p>
<p>more information on the Camp website</p>

<p> </p></div>","Hello!  My name is Coral and I am an artist/designer with a small business called Squared Array.  I make fun, unique and versatile modern designs for the home and office.  I have been doing well in sales recently and am looking to further expand my business and artistic skillsets.  I heard about the Camp which is a 4 day and 3 night workshop in Big Bear, CA that is a gathering of like-minded creators and small business owners in the arts. 
This is of great importance to me as growing a small business in the handmade art industry is challenging.  I am hoping to find local small business support resources within the art community, build relationships that lead to potential artistic collaborations, and learn some new creative skillsets at the Camp conference.  This is also part of my business 3-5 year plan.  I had expected to pay for this myself but I have had to invest in my business recently in order to produce a large amount of orders that came in from a few websites that my pieces were on - this is a good thing of course.  However, it will take a few months before I make that money back and by then the conference I am hoping to attend will be over. 

The funding I am requesting will go to Camp registration which is $1,200.  This covers the following:
- new ideas
- hands-on workshops and classes
- key note speakers from the industry
- food/room and board
- networking with like minded peers
- leadership skills
more information on the Camp website

If I don't reach my goal of the registration amount I will assess if I can come up with the rest I am short on and cover that portion. If I am not able to come up with the rest I will put the amount into my business to purchase a few woodworking tools I need for my modern wood art pieces. 
Any help is greatly appreciated even if it is just forwarding onto others who may want to contribute towards small business development in handmade arts.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

It has become an important event in the cultural calendar for the whole country and has even been mentioned in the latest Lonely Planet guide for Uganda!<br/><br/>Now why, if LaBa! is such a success, would we think of asking you guys for money? Shouldn’t we have enough? No. Due to economic instabilities in the world and especially in Europe, it is very hard to get sponsors for this year’s event. Some of our long-time supporters don’t see a way to be on board this time.<br/><br/>It’s a shame because this year we are trying out a new concept. The theme “Open Studio” challenges artists to actually produce something in public and to interact with the audience rather than exhibiting or selling their finished products. LaBa! is open for all art genres. The festival doesn’t take place behind closed doors or in an elitist setting but on an ordinary street in Kampala. It therefore encourages people to take part in it who wouldn’t usually attend an art festival. With LaBa!, art comes to the people.<br/><br/>In order for it to take place without a loss of quality, we ask you for your help. Your contribution is not a donation for us as a cultural society but for the Ugandan artists and their ideas to make the festival come to life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Please also have a look at our youtube channel:</p>

<p>Wir möchten eure Aufmerksamkeit auf unser Kunstfestival LaBa! richten (25. Mai 2013 in Kampala, Uganda) und euch um Hilfe bitten! Wir, das Goethe-Zentrum Kampala/ Ugandan German Cultural Society (GZK/ UGCS) sind eine gemeinnützige ugandische Nichtregierungsorganisation mit Sitz in Kampala, Uganda. Mit einer Gruppe engagierter Künstler tragen wir das Festival in diesem Jahr zum siebten Mal in Folge aus, das sich national als wichtiges Event im kulturellen Kalender etabliert hat und sogar im aktuellen Lonely-Planet-Reiseführer erwähnt wird.</p>
<p> Warum, aber, wenn LaBa! ein solcher Erfolg ist, bitten wir euch um finanzielle Unterstützung? Sollten wir nicht genug Geld haben? Leider nein. Weil überall auf der Welt das Geld knapp ist, war es in diesem Jahr besonders schwierig, genügend Sponsoren anzuwerben. Einige unserer langjährigen Partner sahen keine Möglichkeit, in diesem Jahr wieder dabei zu sein.</p>
<p> Für dieses Jahr haben wir unser Konzept überarbeitet: Das Motto „Open Studio“ fordert die Künstler dazu heraus, ihre Kunst vor Ort zu kreieren und die Zuschauer daran teilhaben zu lassen – anstatt bloß fertige Produkte auszustellen. LaBa! ist offen für alle Kunstsparten. Das Festival findet nicht hinter verschlossenen Türen oder in einem elitären Umfeld statt, sondern auf offener Straße in Kampala. Auf diese Weise lockt es Menschen an, die ansonsten kaum mit Kunst in Berührung kommen würden. Mit LaBa! kommt die Kunst also zu den Menschen.</p>
<p>Damit das Festival ohne qualitative Kompromisse stattfinden kann, bitten wir euch um Hilfe. Damit unterstützt ihr nicht uns als Kulturorganisation, sondern helft letztendlich unseren ugandischen Künstlern dabei, ihre Ideen zu verwirklichen.</p>

Shouldn’t we have enough? No. Due to economic instabilities in the world and especially in Europe, it is very hard to get sponsors for this year’s event. Some of our long-time supporters don’t see a way to be on board this time.It’s a shame because this year we are trying out a new concept. The theme “Open Studio” challenges artists to actually produce something in public and to interact with the audience rather than exhibiting or selling their finished products. LaBa! is open for all art genres. The festival doesn’t take place behind closed doors or in an elitist setting but on an ordinary street in Kampala. It therefore encourages people to take part in it who wouldn’t usually attend an art festival. With LaBa!, art comes to the people.In order for it to take place without a loss of quality, we ask you for your help. Your contribution is not a donation for us as a cultural society but for the Ugandan artists and their ideas to make the festival come to life.

Wir möchten eure Aufmerksamkeit auf unser Kunstfestival LaBa! richten (25. Mai 2013 in Kampala, Uganda) und euch um Hilfe bitten! Wir, das Goethe-Zentrum Kampala/ Ugandan German Cultural Society (GZK/ UGCS) sind eine gemeinnützige ugandische Nichtregierungsorganisation mit Sitz in Kampala, Uganda. Mit einer Gruppe engagierter Künstler tragen wir das Festival in diesem Jahr zum siebten Mal in Folge aus, das sich national als wichtiges Event im kulturellen Kalender etabliert hat und sogar im aktuellen Lonely-Planet-Reiseführer erwähnt wird.
 Warum, aber, wenn LaBa! ein solcher Erfolg ist, bitten wir euch um finanzielle Unterstützung? Sollten wir nicht genug Geld haben? Leider nein. Weil überall auf der Welt das Geld knapp ist, war es in diesem Jahr besonders schwierig, genügend Sponsoren anzuwerben. Einige unserer langjährigen Partner sahen keine Möglichkeit, in diesem Jahr wieder dabei zu sein.
 Für dieses Jahr haben wir unser Konzept überarbeitet: Das Motto „Open Studio“ fordert die Künstler dazu heraus, ihre Kunst vor Ort zu kreieren und die Zuschauer daran teilhaben zu lassen – anstatt bloß fertige Produkte auszustellen. LaBa! ist offen für alle Kunstsparten. Das Festival findet nicht hinter verschlossenen Türen oder in einem elitären Umfeld statt, sondern auf offener Straße in Kampala. Auf diese Weise lockt es Menschen an, die ansonsten kaum mit Kunst in Berührung kommen würden. Mit LaBa! kommt die Kunst also zu den Menschen.
Damit das Festival ohne qualitative Kompromisse stattfinden kann, bitten wir euch um Hilfe. Damit unterstützt ihr nicht uns als Kulturorganisation, sondern helft letztendlich unseren ugandischen Künstlern dabei, ihre Ideen zu verwirklichen.

<div>Due to my choices, my wife and I are separating after a 13 year relationship and 7 year marriage. I have no other option than to relocate to the only other family I have in this world, in South Florida, simply because in being employed in such an industry it makes it hard to do things like work and function like normal people can. Body modification can make someone unemployable, and such is the case for any normal job. </div>
<div>So I have decided to take this opportunity to not mope around, not do foolish things that will hurt my family that I can never take back, but to move on in a positive light and embrace this new life, and Id love to take you along with me the entire way.

<p>The plan is to purchase a go-pro hero 4 silver and a mount, which comes to a grand total of $469.98 shipped free to me, and for me to have this and be able to document all this change for my children would be huge, but I also want to create a channel that will show my travels. I plan to travel the country/world  and do body suspension, piercing, and body mods all along the way, as well as attend any  experience I can take in, and would love to have anyone interested to tag along.  If you donate to this, and if you so please I will be more than willing to travel to you while in your area, and work on you as well at a greatly reduced rate.  If all the funds aren't met, I will prove that the money donated will go towards the camera and only the camera. I have no desire for any sort of monetary gain, and will refund as well upon request if funds aren't met.</p>
<p>The impact of me being able to get this camera without having to completely sell any my possessions would be so great, as I am doing so now to make ends meet while I remain with my family (out of the kindness of my wife for us to have a normal holiday season). The choices I have made were selfish and have completely torn apart my marriage, and in having to go, this may be one of the only things I can positively bring out of this in the near future. </p>

As current students in the Special Events Planning Program at George Brown College, we were tasked with planning a charitable event. Art In The 6ix supports youth artists in the Greater Toronto Area with 100% of all donations going towards AFCY (Arts for Children and Youth) and the George Brown College Foundation.
 


WE NEED YOUR HELP
We are currently working with a limited budget as the school does not provide us with any monetary support. All money donated goes directly to putting on this event as we are hoping to raise $2,000 for our charities.
 Toronto is a very diverse city with local artists who deserve to be showcased and appreciated. This event will shine a light on their talent and bring awareness to two great local charities in Toronto.




WHAT IS ART IN THE 6IX?
This event will primarily consist of visual and performance art. There will also be featured live performances from Carter Behnke and DJ FeelGoodSmalls. During the show there will be a silent auction that will consist of all the displayed artwork as well as sponsored gift baskets at our raffle table. At this 19+ event, we have included passed hors d'oeuvres in the ticket price, and will have a cash bar on site. 100% of all profits from Art In The 6ix will go evenly to the George Brown Scholarship Fund, as well as AFCY.


WHEN IS ART IN THE 6IX?
The event will take place on Thursday, February 12th, 2015 from 7:00 - 10:00PM.

<p></p>
<p>School of Service began in 1971 and has grown steadily since, evolving into the thriving Access Arts program of
today.  Our mission is to provide
creative learning experiences for everyone. 
We offer instruction in a variety of art media, with an emphasis on
serving those who are underserved.  </p>
<p>Each summer, we pair up local
celebrities with local artists. Each celebrity gets to pick the medium s/he
wants to learn, and we match them with an artist who is skilled in that area.
The artists teach the celebrities how to make something (paintings, drawings,
sculpture, etc.) and each pair has a filmmaker document their work.</p>
<p>The culminating event is called
CelebrARTy. This annual fundraiser helps Access Arts achieve its mission
throughout the year by raising valuable operational funds.  You’re invited to join us for a spectacular
evening including a heavy appetizers and drinks reception where the
celebrities’ masterpieces will be auctioned off and patrons will get an
exclusive first look at the documentaries created during the process.  This year’s
CelebrARTy will be hosted at Dogmaster Distillery on October 29. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>Our
fundraising goal is $10,000. This campaign will help us cover the cost of all those up-front expenses that come with hosting our event:  Artist and Filmmaker Stipends, Venue rental, Art supplies, Art Framing &amp; Display materials, Food and Beverages, etc.  Any amount we receive in addition to our campaign goal will help to sustain Access Arts’ work throughout the year. Our work helps thousands of participants who span across age groups, racial lines, social classes, and various stages of ability. </p>
<p>To help make this campaign extra
special, all of the perks offered are handmade items by the community of
artists who love and support the work we do.  The perk you receive will be totally unique, unlike anyone else's.  </p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>CelebrARTy
was born from a conversation about our mission. 
We wanted to host an event that would embody our mission’s four components:  Creative, Learning,
Experience, and Everyone.  We believe
that all four of these components are equally important, but it seems that it
is the Everyone part that is the hardest to uphold.  So many people say, “Oh, I’m not an
artist!  I don’t have a creative bone in
my body!” Yet our world needs creative problem solvers to tackle complex issues
that affect us all.  We believe that this
barrier of “I’m not creative” can be overcome. 
We intentionally choose celebrities that are well-known and respected in
their professional areas of expertise--areas NOT typically viewed as creative
or artistic.  They are our examples, showing
that if So-and-So (i.e. professional athlete, politician, newspaper editor,
etc.) can make art, anyone can: even you!  We take away their intimidation by pairing up celebs with an artist
mentor to guide them. This personalized instruction demonstrates the value of
quality art instruction amidst today’s plethora of D.I.Y. Pinterest tags and
You Tube videos.  We see the impact of
such instruction in our classrooms every day, as individual students develop
skills and interact with people of differing backgrounds, exploring new ideas
and possibilities.  Creative Learning is
essential for building healthy communities. 
CelebrARTy is our way of putting this issue in the spotlight,
demonstrating its potential, and having fun in the process.  You as a contributor can be a part of
changing the way our society views art education.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>Organizing a group of celebrities, artists, filmmakers, and
event logistics staff is quite an undertaking. 
Since each person has a career, family, and other obligations to juggle,
it is difficult to coordinate schedules and ensure the artwork and videos are
completed before the event.  We have a
dedicated planning committee comprised of board members, Access Arts staff, and
other volunteers who have years of experience with event planning.  The individuals on this committee work
closely with each artist-celeb-filmmaker team, assisting them with the unique
needs of their projects (procuring supplies, scheduling studio space, etc.) to
streamline the process and keep the projects moving forward.</p>
<p>Given that these celebrities are quite busy and in high
demand, the biggest challenge we face is their limited time.  We begin our conversations with potential
participants by describing the time commitment expected of them and our
deadlines for completing their work.  By
outlining these things from the beginning, a celebrity can realistically
estimate whether s/he can complete the project.  </p>
<p>Of course, no matter how much you plan, sometimes things
just come up.  Last year, in the middle
of his painting lessons, one of our celebrities, Kim English, was called to
Chicago to begin training with the Chicago Bulls. Such hurdles always arise
with large-scale projects, but all of our celebrities are committed to
finishing their projects and supporting our mission. Together with our planning
committee, any problem that comes up can be solved.  In Kim’s situation, we arranged for his
remaining lessons to be done via Skype and his artwork was shipped back for the
auction.  Kim valued his own experience
with his artist mentor so much that he even scheduled a flight back to Columbia
to attend the auction in person.   </p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p></p>

School of Service began in 1971 and has grown steadily since, evolving into the thriving Access Arts program of
today.  Our mission is to provide
creative learning experiences for everyone. 
We offer instruction in a variety of art media, with an emphasis on
serving those who are underserved.  
Each summer, we pair up local
celebrities with local artists. Each celebrity gets to pick the medium s/he
wants to learn, and we match them with an artist who is skilled in that area.
The artists teach the celebrities how to make something (paintings, drawings,
sculpture, etc.) and each pair has a filmmaker document their work.
The culminating event is called
CelebrARTy. This annual fundraiser helps Access Arts achieve its mission
throughout the year by raising valuable operational funds.  You’re invited to join us for a spectacular
evening including a heavy appetizers and drinks reception where the
celebrities’ masterpieces will be auctioned off and patrons will get an
exclusive first look at the documentaries created during the process.  This year’s
CelebrARTy will be hosted at Dogmaster Distillery on October 29. 

   What We Need & What You Get 
Our
fundraising goal is $10,000. This campaign will help us cover the cost of all those up-front expenses that come with hosting our event:  Artist and Filmmaker Stipends, Venue rental, Art supplies, Art Framing & Display materials, Food and Beverages, etc.  Any amount we receive in addition to our campaign goal will help to sustain Access Arts’ work throughout the year. Our work helps thousands of participants who span across age groups, racial lines, social classes, and various stages of ability. 
To help make this campaign extra
special, all of the perks offered are handmade items by the community of
artists who love and support the work we do.  The perk you receive will be totally unique, unlike anyone else's.     The Impact 
CelebrARTy
was born from a conversation about our mission. 
We wanted to host an event that would embody our mission’s four components:  Creative, Learning,
Experience, and Everyone.  We believe
that all four of these components are equally important, but it seems that it
is the Everyone part that is the hardest to uphold.  So many people say, “Oh, I’m not an
artist!  I don’t have a creative bone in
my body!” Yet our world needs creative problem solvers to tackle complex issues
that affect us all.  We believe that this

<p><b>Liquid Heat</b> is a Public Art and Community Project for East Harlem, New York City.   </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The Art Project</strong></p>
<p>Photographer Jessica Angel is collaborating with the renowned New York City based dance company - <b>Ballet Hispanico</b> - to create a series of vibrant photographic images of Latin dance. The images are printed on architectural scale canvases to create a series of installations in streets across el Barrio.  The images will both reflect and nurture the vibrant Hispanic culture of El Barrio by connecting with the existing mural art trail. The work will animate the streetscape and architecture bringing the energy of dance to the fore and bring the dance from the streets, via the theatre, back to the streets.</p>
<p>The <b>‘show’</b> will be an invitation to discover the <b>‘art trail’</b> through Manhattan. The works will be installed in a temporary exhibition throughout the spring and summer of 2015.</p>
<p>Liquid Heat will develop a website presence to bring the images to a wider public.  With recordings of poetry by the Puerto Rican poet Luis Pales Matos  – there will be an animated photographic montage and short film on the website to reach the broader Latin American and Caribbean communities and convey the essence of the wider project. </p>
<p><strong>The Community Project</strong></p>
<p>In parallel to the Art Project is  the outreach programme that will foster community engagement.  This will feature an artist's residency at Ballet Hispanico leading to a photographic competition for the young students of Ballet Hispanico. The students come from marginalised Hispanic communities across New York City. They will be invited to capture the spirit of Latino dance in their classes and in their families and home neighbourhoods and look at their dances and culture through a different lens.  We will invite our key partners (Ballet Hispanico &amp; key local Community partners) to select and curate a series of images which form a key component of the art trail.  The images will be displayed on the bus furniture, buses and information boards on the bus routes running between 96 Street and 120 Street, and across town.  These images will visually link with the large-scale works.</p>
<p>This element of the project will form part of a sustainable legacy achieved through this exciting international and pan-Hispanic project.</p>
<p><strong>Why this project?</strong></p>
<p>This is a highly visual, high impact public art project, which is all about:</p>

The Shoe Boxes, and they have been dropping into the Shoe Box Collective´s post boxes over the last week!! The first Phase is now underway! ART is being made!!About me and ""The Art in Shoe
Box Project"". 
My name is Mara Barth, I am passionate about
art and culture, especially collaborative projects. I enjoy bringing people from different disciplines together to explore creative approaches and
perspectives. The shoe box project will be a representation of this type of dialogue. The limited space of the shoe box challenges the artist and a highly concentrated
and intimate form of creativity and art will be captured.  My MA project. ""Art in Shoe Boxes"" is the reflective project for my MA in Culture and Creative Enterprise at Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh. Applying the skills I have learnt throughout the course I will work as the project manager of the ""Art in Shoe Box Project"", bringing together creative perspectives and approaches throughout Europe. This project gives us the opportunity to explore collaboration in the arts and develop new and innovative ideas and experiences.

 artists. The goal is to provide artists with an optimal space with resources for research, creativity and the opportunity to produce individual creative proposals while engaging in a cultural and creative exchange.</span></span>
</div>
<div>
<br/><p><b>El Residencial</b> provides a communal home, workshop space, a yard of approximately 700 meters with fruit trees and garden and the opportunity to share with local and international artists while coexisting with the community of San Antón (Carolina, PR). This neighborhood is surrounded by: water springs, edible tropical fruit trees, garden and a diverse community. During the residency we hope that each artist will focus on their own practice while flowing with what the space and community has to offer. We believe that we are our best teachers, so we strongly encourage the exchange of tools, techniques and methodologies for creating artistic work with participating artists and community members of San Anton. The artists will also have the opportunity to share their work and also participate in cultural events that will be happening in Puerto Rico during the time of the residency. </p>During last year’s residency, El Residencial 2013, we had the opportunity to share and create with the following artists: Sunny Drake (Australia-Canada), Nisha Ahuja (Canada), Roxanna Vahed (Rep. Dom.-Canada), Awilda Rodríguez Lora, Lydela Leonor y Michelle Nonó (Puerto Rico). From that process the following projects where conceived: Manual del Bestiario Doméstico de Las Nietas de Nonó and  La Mujer Maravilla de Awilda Rodriguez Lora. </div>
<div>
<br/><p><b>Patio Taller</b> is a creative space for artist and community members to meet and share located in the neighborhood of San Anton, Carolina. Nonó’s granddaughters opened the space so it can become a meeting place for members of the community of San Anton. It is a place where the artist and the community can create and exchange while embracing sustainability and solidarity.</p>The vision of <b>Patio Taller</b> is to promote a social/cultural exchange between community members and artist by having conversations, workshops, residencies and a creative practice that allows for an exchange of skills, stories and art. The space is open for artist that are already active in the community of San Anton and  artists in the island and abroad. <a href=""http://www.patiotaller.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.patiotaller.org</a><br/><p></p>

<p>Each artist will be covering their traveling expenses, food and transportation, <b>patio taller</b> will support with lodging, spaces/events for creating and exchanging work.</p>
<p>Our funding goal of $2,000 which will support the artists and patio taller with the cost of hosting the residency. Our estimated budget is a total of $3,015. This budget does not include production and services fees that are being donated by the artists and patio taller.</p>

Zuleira Soto- Román (Puerto Rico)

El Residencial (The Residency) is a 10 day residency for local and international self-directed
 artists. The goal is to provide artists with an optimal space with resources for research, creativity and the opportunity to produce individual creative proposals while engaging in a cultural and creative exchange.


El Residencial provides a communal home, workshop space, a yard of approximately 700 meters with fruit trees and garden and the opportunity to share with local and international artists while coexisting with the community of San Antón (Carolina, PR). This neighborhood is surrounded by: water springs, edible tropical fruit trees, garden and a diverse community. During the residency we hope that each artist will focus on their own practice while flowing with what the space and community has to offer. We believe that we are our best teachers, so we strongly encourage the exchange of tools, techniques and methodologies for creating artistic work with participating artists and community members of San Anton. The artists will also have the opportunity to share their work and also participate in cultural events that will be happening in Puerto Rico during the time of the residency. During last year’s residency, El Residencial 2013, we had the opportunity to share and create with the following artists: Sunny Drake (Australia-Canada), Nisha Ahuja (Canada), Roxanna Vahed (Rep. Dom.-Canada), Awilda Rodríguez Lora, Lydela Leonor y Michelle Nonó (Puerto Rico). From that process the following projects where conceived: Manual del Bestiario Doméstico de Las Nietas de Nonó and  La Mujer Maravilla de Awilda Rodriguez Lora. 

Patio Taller is a creative space for artist and community members to meet and share located in the neighborhood of San Anton, Carolina. Nonó’s granddaughters opened the space so it can become a meeting place for members of the community of San Anton. It is a place where the artist and the community can create and exchange while embracing sustainability and solidarity.The vision of Patio Taller is to promote a social/cultural exchange between community members and artist by having conversations, workshops, residencies and a creative practice that allows for an exchange of skills, stories and art. The space is open for artist that are already active in the community of San Anton and  artists in the island and abroad. www.patiotaller.org
What We Need & What You Get
This is an independent project that is funded by each individual artist with the support of some local business.

Though not an opera in the ordinary sense, the work follows main character Eric Shadowmann (fictional), rise from obscurity to international art star. His journey creates the context for a multi-faceted exploration of the shadow and it's potential for transformation.  </span></p><p></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p><p>MORE:</p>
<p>1. Shadowmann | An Art Opera is an artistic exploration of the shadows which haunt. The work will pull no punches in it's examination of the dark side of our nature.  At the same time it cultivates an ongoing belief in beauty. It is about the ability to transform and the constant course of light which pulls us there.</p>
<p>2. It is an allegorical journey through the life of our main character Eric Shadowman.  The exhibit will be presented as a retrospective of Shadowmann's work through a series of 5 rooms, reflecting upon his journey and the subject at hand. The piece also presents an abstracted, audio/visual construct, incorporating multiple art forms into an unusually rendered, sometimes performative environment.</p>
<p>3. There will be live performers integrated into the installation. They will include two singers, one shadow dancer and an acrobat.  One of the main components of <i>Shadowmann</i> is that the music contributes to the experience of the visual art.  The other performers lend a purposeful context, as well as lines of abstraction.  Viewers will experience the exhibit in daily performances, with everything at hand, including the viewers, forming that experience. The exhibit has also been designed to exist outside of performances, standing as a modular installation with it's own particular logic and ouvre.</p>
<p>4. Speaking to the particular synergy of artistic disciplines which encompasses this work, <i>Shadowmann</i> will also represent an abstraction of the energy createad <i>between</i> those disciplines.  It will reveal, through a series of artistic devices, the palpable connections which exist in invisible spaces. </p>
<p>5. The installation will be concerned with original invention at every turn, sometimes combining the languages of multiple disciplines in rapid progression to convey a point; or set the stage for extended moments of contemplative viewing.  Eric Shadowmann's work evolves from his dark and seminal Flourescent Series I (1979),  to his late life explorations via his ""Unified Field Theory of Art and Music.""  Along the way work will include imaginative, multimedia sculpture like, ""The Fun House.""  A 60‘ stainless steel construction, which will exist at angles, just large enough in its interior to allow one person to pass through. The interior will reflect a very different experience, mirrored in sculptural constructions, echoing a ‘house of horrors' typical of Mexican traveling carnivals of the late 70's and early 80's. </p><p></p>
<p>SHADOWMANN/AN ART OPERA will be created by myself and a few extraordinary collaborators.  Past collaborators have included artists as varied as Kiki Smith, Terry Allen, George Romero, Bill Frisell and Ed Harris. The exhibition will reflect not only Eric Shadowmann's personal journey, but the significant impact he had on the art world during the course of his career. </p>
<p>Shadowmann | An Art Opera is intended to premiere in either Autumn 2015, or Spring 2016.</p>

<p><i>SHADOWMANN's</i> music is in part a re-imagining of excerpts from my 1977 score for George Romero’s “Martin,” including improvisations and cracked off bits of the recorded score.  That music will be combined with a new set of original songs, two of which I am including here in the form of basic, unmastered tracks.</p>

<p></p></div>","SHADOWMANN/AN ART OPERAShadowmann | An Art Opera employs an unusual synergy of visual arts, music, dance, theatre and film in creating a new form. Though not an opera in the ordinary sense, the work follows main character Eric Shadowmann (fictional), rise from obscurity to international art star. His journey creates the context for a multi-faceted exploration of the shadow and it's potential for transformation.  MORE:
1. Shadowmann | An Art Opera is an artistic exploration of the shadows which haunt. The work will pull no punches in it's examination of the dark side of our nature.  At the same time it cultivates an ongoing belief in beauty. It is about the ability to transform and the constant course of light which pulls us there.
2. It is an allegorical journey through the life of our main character Eric Shadowman.  The exhibit will be presented as a retrospective of Shadowmann's work through a series of 5 rooms, reflecting upon his journey and the subject at hand. The piece also presents an abstracted, audio/visual construct, incorporating multiple art forms into an unusually rendered, sometimes performative environment.
3. There will be live performers integrated into the installation. They will include two singers, one shadow dancer and an acrobat.  One of the main components of Shadowmann is that the music contributes to the experience of the visual art.  The other performers lend a purposeful context, as well as lines of abstraction.  Viewers will experience the exhibit in daily performances, with everything at hand, including the viewers, forming that experience. The exhibit has also been designed to exist outside of performances, standing as a modular installation with it's own particular logic and ouvre.
4. Speaking to the particular synergy of artistic disciplines which encompasses this work, Shadowmann will also represent an abstraction of the energy createad between those disciplines.  It will reveal, through a series of artistic devices, the palpable connections which exist in invisible spaces. 
5. The installation will be concerned with original invention at every turn, sometimes combining the languages of multiple disciplines in rapid progression to convey a point; or set the stage for extended moments of contemplative viewing.  Eric Shadowmann's work evolves from his dark and seminal Flourescent Series I (1979),  to his late life explorations via his ""Unified Field Theory of Art and Music.""  Along the way work will include imaginative, multimedia sculpture like, ""The Fun House.""  A 60‘ stainless steel construction, which will exist at angles, just large enough in its interior to allow one person to pass through. The interior will reflect a very different experience, mirrored in sculptural constructions, echoing a ‘house of horrors' typical of Mexican traveling carnivals of the late 70's and early 80's. 
SHADOWMANN/AN ART OPERA will be created by myself and a few extraordinary collaborators.  Past collaborators have included artists as varied as Kiki Smith, Terry Allen, George Romero, Bill Frisell and Ed Harris. The exhibition will reflect not only Eric Shadowmann's personal journey, but the significant impact he had on the art world during the course of his career. 
Shadowmann | An Art Opera is intended to premiere in either Autumn 2015, or Spring 2016.
There are WONDERFUL PERKS offered for your support!
I intend to create a work which will offer a new experience for the 21st century. It want to give this work to delight and inspire, from my soul to yours. Thank you,
Donald Rubinstein
What we have accomplished thus far 
1.  A new art form.
2. Created over 130 works of visual art, some of which will be seen in my upcoming one-person exhibition in Santa Fe, NM. 
3. Written and recorded basic tracks for 7 new songs.
4.  I am composing a new operatic, musical composition, which will include creative re-imaginings from my score to the feature film, “Martin.” (One of the top one hundred coolest film scores of all time” Mojo). 
5.  A room by room synopsis is in process.
6.  Conceived plans for three unique, large-scale, multimedia sculptures, with drawings in process. 
7.  A  computer rendering of the entire installation.
7. In talks with some very exciting collaborators and finalizing commitments.
We are less than one year away from making Shadowmann | An Art Opera, a sparkling reality.  Please support us.  This work will reflect not only my own dreams, but I intend yours as well.  
Thank you very much,
Donald RubinsteinSee additional images drawn from SHADOWMANN,http://donaldrubinsteinart.comMUSIC
SHADOWMANN's music is in part a re-imagining of excerpts from my 1977 score for George Romero’s “Martin,” including improvisations and cracked off bits of the recorded score.  That music will be combined with a new set of original songs, two of which I am including here in the form of basic, unmastered tracks.
Please find links to the songs, as well as the original main theme from “Martin” below.

I have been working full-time on SHADOWMANN for over a year, though it’s concepts have been at the root of my artistic exploration  for over thirty.  I am  creating what I believe will be a compelling experience for both art, theater and opera patrons alike.  If you are unfamiliar with my work please refer to the website’s bio/press link and Wikipedia page, below.

Santa Fe, New Mexico
July 4, 2014HOW YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS WILL BE USED1. To complete a series of art works for my upcoming, one-person exhibit at Cloud 5 Project in Santa Fe, NM.  This work represents an integral step in the complex visual components of SHADOWMANN.
2. The completion of plans for three newly conceived, multimedia sculptures.
3. A written synopsis and computer modeling of the entire, four room, installation. 4. We are finalizing commitments from a few key collaborators. An investment prospectus will be completed and offered to waiting investors by January, 2015. SHADOWMANN’s third and final funding phase will be completed in partnership with a museum or art space, investors and a fiscal partnership with a yet to be designated non-profit.  The response thus far has been VERY encouraging.  I have worked on my own for over a year, as well as via the generous support of The Robert Rauschenberg Foundation, where as a resident fellow in February/March 2014, The Art Opera revealed itself.  Will it happen without your support?  Yes, it will.  I will make it happen in some manner of form, no matter what. However, with your support it will be shared with a joy and largess that will create a vision for our time, and one to be reckoned with. Thank you for your vision, faith, and support.

</div></div>","With the HEADTOOTH Pro, we’ve eliminated the inconveniences such as unstable connections, poor sound quality, and restricted range that come with other wireless helmet communication devices.Use the HEADTOOTH Pro during your next adventure and enjoy uninterrupted connections, crystal clear surround sound audio thanks to the 2 HiFi HD Speakers & Vibration Woofer speaker, and a long distance connectivity range of up to 3.1mi(5km).       The MUC (Multilateral Frequency Used Communication System) is a system built on the well known communication technology behind walkie-talkies. Compared to the Node(B/T) Network which is typically used in other helmet communication devices, the MUC system allows for uninterrupted long range communication from 1.2mi(2km) up to 3.1mi(5km).Best of all, we’ve made sure that an unlimited number of users can be active in the group call without having to go through a complicated pairing process.        The MUC is an area-based system of communication with a strong connection levels regardless of the number of users.On the other hand, with Node (B/T) Network, the larger the distance between each user, the more unstable the connection.    Because the MUC system uses UHF (Ultra High Frequency), long distance communication of up to 3.1mi(5km) is possible with a minimum of two users.   The MUC system is less susceptible to distortion or interference from environmental obstacles so that strong connections can be upheld even in dense urban areas.      The HEADTOOTH Pro isn’t limited to just motorcycle enthusiasts. Whether you’re cycling, snowboarding, skiing, ATV riding, the HEADTOOTH Pro will take care of all of your communication needs.        The HEADTOOTH Pro has been designed to be both dustproof AND waterproof so that you can consistently have high levels of communication in rain, snow, mud, or sunshine.And with the high-quality surround audio and group communication function that is offered in the HEADTOOTH Pro, you can enjoy any outdoor activity solo or with multiple people.       Maximize the benefits that come with the UHF wavelength that allows for maximum communication range. Stay in touch with your fellow riders and other athletes for up to 3.1mi(5km).   MUC systems are highly resistant to distortion or interference from external radio waves. We conducted a Field Stress Test at a busy downtown intersection and discovered that while B/T intercom devices were only able to maintain a stable connection up to 0.3mi(500m), our HEADTOOTH Pro was able to up that to 1.2mi(2km).       The FREE LICENSE frequency that is available in each established country allowed us to create a commssystem that lets people to hop in or out of group calls without having to go through a pairing process. As long as the channels between each user are the same, group communication is possible for an unlimited number of users within the given range. If someone from your group happens to roam outside of the range, they can simply pop in back into the group automatically when they do enter the given range.  Regardless of the numbers of users in a group call, the stability of the connection will not be compromised thanks to the MUC system that is built into each HEADTOOTH Pro.       The HEADTOOTH Pro comes with a built-in vibration woofer speaker that utilizes bone conduction technology for richer bass sounds. The 2 slim HD speakers allow you to enjoy fantastic surround sound audio with detailed acoustics for an unrivaled audio experience.   A wide selection of equalizer settings allow you to enjoy your audio in an optimized sound environment based on your music tastes.    Each HEADTOOTH Pro also has a built-in noise cancellation chip that blocks out ambient sounds so that it picks up only your voice. Your fellow riders will thank you for the clear comms. Different helmet types require different types of mics which is why two mics are included with a single HEADTOOTH Pro. Select and attach the appropriate mic that fits your helmet.      Attach the remote control to your bike handle, ski pole, wrist, bag strap, or any other accessory with the included Velcro band. Now you can customize the placement of the remote to control the HEADTOOTH Pro the way you want to. The remote controller showcases a simple and intuitive design that makes device control an absolute breeze.    Pair the HEADTOOTH Pro with your phone and speak into the mic to get started with any voice recognition assistant like Siri, Google Assistant, Bixby and other Voice assistant service! This gives you even a greater level of safety while still being able to control your phone.      While the HEADTOOTH Pro features the MUC system, it also supports the widely used B/T intercom system. This means that you can still hold group calls with people who use other helmet communication devices as long as the same settings are selected.(*Some devices may not support B/T intercom connection with third-party products)    Since the MUC system was designed based on the walkie-talkie’s PTT technology, communication with other walkie-talkie like devices is also possible. Communicate easily with HEADTOOTH Pro in designated areas where radio is required.   The HEADTOOTH Pro which also operates similarly to push-to-talk (PTT) functions makes it compatible with commercially available PPT apps as well! Enjoy communicating with people from all around the world with this function.       If you remove the main HEADTOOTH Pro unit, it can be used as a portable Vibration speaker so that you can enjoy your music anytime, anywhere.   We’ve also developed an app that will allow users to conveniently operate the HEADTOOTH Pro and control all of the device functions such as the MUC comms system, B/T Intercom comms,  sound equalizer settings, vibration woofer on/off functions, and switching between radio frequencies.   The 1000mAh battery allows HEADTOOTH Pro users to play music continuously for up to 10 hours when fully charged. It also comes with a C-Type port and cable so that you can charge it anytime, anywhere.      The HEADTOOTH Pro can be easily attached or detached from not only bike helmets, but also various types of helmets for other activities such as skiing, snowboarding, cycling, and more. Try using the group call function while enjoying any outdoor activity of your choice!   1. Assemble the parts

Yeil Electronics is a company that specializes in the development of more than 100 original technologies that utilize vibration features. 
We have been creating various wearable devices that have been equipped with bone conduction elements and have also created the vibration motors that have been installed in Samsung Electronics smartphones.  Based on our company's 15 years of experience in vibration technology, we created the 'HEADTOOTH Pro' to create a rich, harmonizing balance of effects between the Vibration Woofer and the 2 HD Slim Speakers.

Final Manufacturing Phase Underway!

 
 
Below are the early prototypes and how far we've come since April 2020:



 

 
Does anyone even remember what triple-tapping on your right earbud does?
How about a tap-and-hold followed by a slide
Or a double-tap-and-slide-and-hold
 

 
And who hasn't run into all the pairing, re-pairing issues, just to switch Bluetooth connection from listening to music on your iPhone, to taking a Zoom call on your Windows laptop.
 
   The smart charging case is the User Interface. An innovation in True Wireless user experience.Image above shows our prototype at the start of the campaign   From listening to music on your iPhone, to taking a zoom call on your Windows Laptop, to switching over to watch a movie on your Android TV or tablet - control is at your fingertips via the smart case.Switch connections quickly to any of an unlimited number of devices previously paired with, across any operating system, via the smart case UI. Today's typical modern end-user interacts with up to five different devices over the course of a day. These are the one earbuds to connect across all the devices you interact with, over your entire day. Image above shows our prototype at the start of the campaign    All functionality can be controlled from the intuitive smart case user interface. Play, pause, change volume, toggle noise cancellation, control transparency mode levels, set up pairing with new devices, switch connections, etc.    Battery life of each individual earbud and the case itself, as well as the name of the current device connected to, always within sight at all times. No more fumbling to try to figure out which device your earbuds connect to the moment you take them out of the case.No more surprises running low on batt during a call. Or struggling to check how much battery life is left, using the same device you're currently taking a video call from.    It already supports the new Bluetooth standard.LE Audio supports broadcast Bluetooth from a single source to multiple earphones - allowing you to share your music from a single device, with your family and friends.This is perfect for watching TV at home with your partner while the kids are asleep. But this introduces an even more complex variation of sources you can switch your earphones to.  In the LE Audio world, using your own individual earphones and being able to quickly switch over from one source to another, is essential. But this is where current earbuds UX is an unbelievable hassle.With Morph, you're ready for this new world.  The most advanced Bluetooth 5.2 earbuds ever.

Ultra Long battery - 24h battery life with single charge, 50h with charging case.

Bluetooth 5.2, LE Audio Ready - Hardware already supports the next Bluetooth standard. Firmware upgradeability ensures maximum support as and when new LE Audio devices are released over the next years. 

Qualcomm Adaptive ANC - Latest in ultra-low power Active Noise Cancellation tech from Qualcomm that you can leave running through the day with minimal impact on battery life. Adaptive ANC adjust in real time to changes in how the earbuds fit in your ears. It does not rely on requiring a tight seal in your ear, but rather monitors the amount of noise that gets through, and adjusts the audio and ANC accordingly in real time. This provides best in class performance especially in environments where the earbuds may move such as during fitness workouts.

Qualcomm TrueWireless Mirroring - For automatic and seamless primary/secondary role handover between earbuds, for a super stable drop-free signal. Use one earbud, or the other, or both. Switch between them anytime, with no interruption to your audio.

Transparency Mode -  Super-low latency ""leak-through"" for environmental awareness. Allows you to hear the surroundings without needing to remove the earbuds.

Always-On Voice Assistant - So you can use these services anytime your hands are busy, such as when driving or cycling, without needing to tap on a button.

aptX Adaptive - Latest in Bluetooth codec for earbuds. Dynamic low latency mode, Adaptive bit rate, HD quality audio. 

aptX Voice - For extreme clarity in voice calls. Enables 32kHz Super Wideband voice calls over Bluetooth.

8th Gen cVc audio processing  -  Suite of algorithms for Echo Cancelling and Noise Suppression with 2-mic input. 

Knowles Balanced Armature driver - A single full range high quality BA driver, pro-tuned for amazing clarity in the mids, and a punchy but not overbearing bass.

IPX5 - Sweatproof for use in all your heavy workouts.

Earbuds Tap Detection - Configurable single / double tap detection on the earbuds themselves.

Wireless Charging - for easy and convenient charging of the smartcase.

Spatial Audio - HRTF based spatial audio processing for amazingly immersive audio.

Welcome to 2021.Zoom calls. Global suppliers. We live in the era of fast and easy communication. And yet when it comes to translation, most of us are lagging well behind the times. We’re still fumbling with outdated phone apps and overpriced interpreters that leave you wondering, is this really 2021? Introducing the WT2 Edge — the world’s first truly bi-directional simultaneous translation earbuds, translating in real-time as you speak and delivering it to your listener’s ear in as little as 0.5 seconds. With up to 95% accuracy in 40 languages and 93 accents, they’re the ultimate tool for breaking the language barrier — whether you’re closing deals on a video call or sparking a friendship at the hotel bar. No more awkward pauses or interpreters, just fast and accurate translations, so you can immerse yourself in the art of conversation. From pillow talk to boardroom banter. Welcome to 2021.   Until now, translating earbuds were a lot like old walkie-talkies. Only one person could speak at a time, while everyone else waited their turn to chime in. The translations worked. But the conversation was anything but natural. Those days are over. With the WT2 Edge, it’s always your turn to speak. The Edge are the first earbuds to offer true bi-directional simultaneous translation, meaning you can speak and hear other people’s translations at the same time – the way conversations were meant to be. No more awkward pauses to wait for your long-winded partner to finish. So your conversations flow naturally, from pillow-talk to boardroom banter. The WT2 Edge earbuds know your voice is unique. That’s why it uses dual beamforming microphones and directional voice recognition to focus on the sound of your voice, separating it from other voices nearby.  So you’ll never mince words with whoever’s sitting next to you. And to make translations even more accurate, the Edge earbuds use smart noise-reduction to filter out distracting background noises. Making sure your message isn’t muddied by motorcycle traffic and tapping pens. So when you do take the floor to speak your mind, your message comes across loud and clear. Every top translation engine has its perks. That’s why we used... all of them. Powered by the world’s 6 leading translation engines (DeepL, Google, Microsoft, iFlytek, AmiVoive, Hoya) and Timekettle its own, the Edge earbuds deliver faster and more accurate translations to your meetings and conversations. They take the advantage of all 6 engines and combines them to deliver a well-rounded translation experience that’s truly world-class. Delivering up to 95 percent accuracy in some languages. So when you’re plugging in at your next industry conference or talking sports with the limo driver, you’ll know your words are getting a world-class treatment. Opportunity rarely knocks twice. That’s why the WT2 Edge uses 15 servers worldwide to deliver you the fastest translations possible, no matter where you are. How fast, you ask? The Edge can deliver simultaneous, bi-directional translations in as little as 0.5 to 3 seconds. Bringing you professional-level translations to help your board meetings and client sit-downs go smoothly. Making connections just got a whole lot easier. Simul Mode helps you connect one on one for effortless face-to-face communication. Just share one of your WT2 Edge earbuds with your partner, and both of your words will be translated in real-time for natural, bi-directional communication without an interpreter. The way conversations were meant to be.The mic is always yours. With Touch Mode, you don’t need to talk over each other in a multi-person meeting. Simply tap your earbud when you have something to say and you’re in control of the conversation. Other mics are muted when it’s your turn to speak, and your message will be translated and delivered to everyone listening. When you’re finished speaking and ready to listen, just tap the earbud again to let someone else have their say. It’s the perfect moderator to your cross-cultural conferences.We know you can’t always ask strangers to put an Edge earbud in while you talk to them – like that taxi driver or bartender who speaks zero English. That’s why we made Speaker Mode. While you’re wearing an earbud, simply say what you need to say. The Edge will then translate and deliver your message through your phone’s speaker, so anyone in earshot can hear it. Or if you prefer to keep the volume down, the Edge app also displays your translation in both languages on the phone screen. It even powers Text-to-Speech to read your typed messages out loud. Now you can go about your day without getting lost in translation. Just because you didn’t study Mandarin in high school doesn’t mean you can’t handle the next business trip to Beijing. The WT2 Edge earbuds support 40 languages and 93 dialects. So no matter where you go, you can put your best foot forward knowing there’s no situation or conversation you can’t handle. From the moment you step off the plane, to the moment you stride into your dinner reservation. The best adventures often happen off the beaten path. That can also mean far from a good internet connection. That’s why we equipped the Edge with seven languages and counting available for offline access. So whether you’re sipping tea with your suppliers in South China or exploring a winery with your partners in Tuscany, the WT2 Edge is there to help get your order right. Travel bans. Quarantines. 2020 brought plenty of unexpected barriers to business. But language doesn’t have to be one of them. The Edge’s Group Chat supports up to thirty people speaking thirty different languages at once, making it ideal for Zoom calls and remote meetings, even when your business spans the globe.  Group Chat even supports both voice-to-text and text-to-text recording through Edge’s app. So you can leave the meeting minutes to us. They’ll be automatically saved to the cloud in your desired language, ready for you to download, copy, and share to your heart’s content. You’ll be the talk of the town with the WT2 Edge’s sleek design. And whether that town is Taiwan or Timbuktu, you’ll understand every word they say in real-time. The Edge earbuds are 46% lighter than our last-gen translating earbuds and 33% smaller. Plus they weigh in at a sleek 5.4 grams each, so you won’t even notice them in your ear while you’re in and out of meetings all day or out exploring the city. We’ve tailored the Edge earbuds to fit your ear comfortably while sealing in audio for superior noise reduction. The WT2 Edge is designed to sit snug in your ears for hours on end. So jump on that moped and enjoy the ride knowing your earbuds will stay right where they belong. Whether you’re closing a business deal or ending a dinner date, the last thing you want to hear is a low battery warning. That’s why the WT2 Edge gives you three hours of nonstop translating time on a single charge. And a full 12 hours with the portable charging case. Meaning you’ll often have enough battery to power a full week of work or a short trip abroad on a single charge. So whether you’re closing a deal in Calcutta or making friends in Frankfurt, you’ll never be cut off mid-sentence. Three years ago, we brought you the first generation of translating earbuds — the WT2. For the first time in history, you could skip the interpreter and have a face-to-face conversation with someone in a completely different language, all with just a simple pair of earbuds. Then came the WT2 Plus — the best-selling translation earbuds on Amazon.com to this day with over 300,000 happy customers. But much like the business world, we never stop looking forward. Now, we’re bringing you the WT2 Edge, the world’s first bi-directional, simultaneous translation earbuds, delivering real-time two-way translations for natural conversation in up to 40 different languages. We’re in the business of breaking down language barriers. We hope you are, too. Finally, a translation tool that can keep up with the pace of business. It’s 2021 — time to demand more from your translations. No more pens to hold, no more awkward typing on your phone. Just a hands-free experience that delivers real-time natural translations within seconds. The Timekettle WT2 Edge are the first earbuds to offer truly bi-directional simultaneous translation, allowing for natural two-way communication without awkward pauses. Our smart noise-reduction technology means you hear more of what matters, while directional voice recognition helps the Edge earbuds to home in on the sound of your voice for clearer translations. Not to mention they support more languages and accents than any other translating earbuds on the market. And with accuracy reaching as high as 95% with translation speeds as fast as 0.5 seconds from our 15 worldwide servers. What will you get in the package if you purchase?

VR ears gives you the full feeling of off-ear surround sound, even as you move your head and body, no matter where the shot is coming from.  • Sounds that move every which way, with you and the video.• Don’t just listen to the world, feel as though you live within it.   Traditional Audio Delivery vs. VR Ears Audio DeliveryWhat is Sound stage?  The width, depth and height of the projected stereo image. What is Audio Imaging?  The positional cues and accuracy of said position of audio sources.Off-ear speaker design, pulls localization of the sound stage out of the head of the listener and transports you directly into the sound field. Experience a visceral feeling as if you were a listener placed in the center of the virtual world.Importance of the Outer Ear for Positional Audio Before sound enters your ears, it bounces around all the flesh on the outer ear(pinna). This biological structure is in fact a large part of what helps you to perceive sound direction and contributes to the reason our ears are shaped in this strange way.VR Ears is the first cross-platform wearable audio device that takes advantage of the outer ear to its full potential. Sounds for your Ears: No Pressure, No Distractions A New Wave of Sound Requires Next Generation SpeakersMost headphones on the market are only passive. To be able to reach the optimum SPL (Sound Pressure Level) at the ear, we made VR Ears active, adding in a lithium polymer battery (lasts up to 8 hours), high efficiency Digital Amplifier and Digital Signal Processor (DSP).  Digital Amplifier: Drives the premium near-field speakers, while minimizing power consumptionDigital Signal Processor (DSP): Monitors the input signal, while continuously optimizing the output to be distortion free for the amplifierThis provides the power to the custom designed near-field drivers to deliver a deep, detailed, and dynamic sound that completely immerses you into the game.Cross-Platform Compatible, Future-ProofedVR ears has developed an audio experience that is nearly on par with sound in the real world, while display optics may need time to catch up. VR Ears is ready for that future.Easy to attach to all the above VR headsets with our modular mechanical attachment clips. Support for further headsets will be released over time with future updates.VR Ears is fully compatible with Quest 2 and the Elite Straps. Note: headsets without a firm head strap, such as the original VIVE without a deluxe audio strap and PiMax without a firm head strap require the VR Ears Universal HeadStrap to use.  
What People are Saying About VR Ears    Become Fully Immersed in Your Virtual WorldThe combination of incredible comfort, complete utilization of the outer ear for positional audio, and a fully immersive sound field and sound stage means you will hear the unimaginable new worlds in VR in incredible new ways. Tech Specs and Controls Acoustic Performance: Near-field 40mm speaker drivers

The last of Earth’s green spaces have been destroyed to make way for sprawling concrete megacities. Corporations have taken all power from the people to fuel their monstrous profits. The people of Earth have all but lost hope, with many moving to live underground. As hope disappears, their once vibrant emotions have also begun to fade. But hope can come from unexpected places. Far away, on the planet GravaStar, courage is alive. Mars and Venus, both GravaStar Bluetooth speakers, have fought many battles, with the sole mission being to protect the universe and keep that music alive at all costs. But this mission requires a special hero. Born to revive Earth’s people, a warrior known as Tifa will travel across the galaxy with the Sirius Pro Bluetooth Earbuds, on a mission to return sound and emotion to the people of earth. Bringing back the music that will inspire new life and rejuvenate humanity with the sense of adventure that was taken from them.Prepare your ears for the next frontier of sound. Cyberpunk design meets meteoric sound in the GravaStar Sirius Pro Earbuds – a sci-fi inspired earbud designed to take your gaming and audio experiences to new horizons. Check out the unboxing review videos from the YouTubers! Stay tuned for more videos coming.





 


The GravaStar Sirius Pro’s charging case features a rugged extra-terrestrial design unlike any other Bluetooth earbuds on the market, with a bottle open design built right into the case. Because you never know when you’ll need to crack a cold one. So the next time someone asks you to borrow an earbud, don’t just share your music. Share a memory.   The launch tower style charging case is made from a zinc alloy material that makes it resistant to scratches and durable enough to take anywhere. Featuring a mechanical button and laser engraved touch panel that gives it a weathered deep space feel.Powerful 7.2mm Dynamic Drivers inside the Sirius Pro deliver bass you can feel in your bones. Meanwhile, four balanced armature driver units designed by the audio experts at Knowles perform like an orchestra, with each driver masterfully playing its part to produce a well-rounded audio experience that delivers on all levels – low, high, and everything in between.Gaming Mode - Pinpoint the direction of your enemy’s footsteps with 5.1 virtual surround sound. Get deeper into your gaming.Movie Mode - Turn anywhere you watch movies into a cinematic experience. With HD surround sound that comes from all directions for even deeper immersion.Music Mode - Front-row seats to concert quality sound. For clear and natural vocals, deep bass delivery, and concert hall acoustics. Just like the artist intended.Environmental noise cancellation cuts out unwanted background noise while strengthening sounds from human voices. So you get crystal clear calls every time.Experience audio that moves as fast as you do - even while gaming in 4K. Bluetooth 5.2 on the Sirius Pro’s has a 65 millisecond response time, so you can forget about lagging audio slowing you down. That means lightspeed gameplay and smoother communication with your team when you need it most.Pair your Android and iOS devices with the Sirius Pro’s fast with Bluetooth 5.2. Fully compatible with your favorite gaming consoles like XBox, PS5, and Nintendo Switch after purchasing an adapter.With in-ear detection, the Sirius Pro’s will power on the instant they’re placed in your ears. And they’ll pause your music the second you take them out.Built for long rides, long trips, or long nights at your computer, the Sirius Pro’s have enough rocket fuel to power your audio for 16 hours. That’s 4 hours of continuous playtime in the buds, and 3 extra charges in the case. So go a level further, play another symphony. You’ve got time to kill.Find your fit with 3 sizes (S, M, L) of soft silicone tips that form effortlessly to your ear while blocking out unwanted noise. The tips are designed to conform to your ear shape for an unshakable fit. And at only 6g per earbud, they’re so light you’ll forget they’re even there.Rated with an IPX5 waterproof rating, the Sirius Pro’s are even built to resist sweat and water, so you can go worry free into the unknown.Change songs, adjust volume, and take calls from mission control (aka your co-workers) - all without ever touching your phone. The Sirius’s smart control means you can handle everything with a single tap. That’s one tap to answer a call from work, and another tap to dive right back into that drum solo.   The premium version (GravaStar Sirius Pro) features additional functions including bottle opener design, in-ear detection and balanced armatures for superior immersive sound quality. While the standard version (GravaStar Sirius) features the rest of the function. And the war-damaged color is only available for the GravaStar Sirius Pro.Each cyberpunk inspired charging case is equipped with six RGB LED lights so you can personalize your case to match your style.  GravaStar Sirius Pro War-damaged Earbuds, 2021 New Launch.

Meanwhile, clever acoustics and DSP sound algorithms give you big sound in a small space across all genres, from crisper highs to deeper lows. With 2.5 inch full-range speakers, you can feel your music no matter the genre. Each zinc alloy shell comes with an extra-terrestrial design that’s both elegant and rugged, making your living room feel like a scene from a sci-fi movie. The new added 6 RGB lights and LED touch volume controls bring the Mars rumbling to life, while 15-hours of battery keep the music alive day and night.The technology of TWS allows you to pair two Mars Pro speakers via Bluetooth.

<p>The incredibly intuitive <strong>Chaos Audio app</strong> (available for both <strong>iOS</strong> and <strong>Android</strong>) allows you to control every aspect of Stratus via <strong>Bluetooth</strong> right from the palm of your hand. You can download new effects from the store, create and save different presets by chaining together up to five effects, and access a wide variety of new features as they become available. The app is also used to update the software running on Stratus, so as bugs and feature requests present themselves, we can take care of them through updates on a regular basis.</p>

<p>It's never been easier to build out unique presets and unleash your creativity. With the ability to <strong>chain up to five effects</strong> together in any order, Stratus serves as an excellent pedal for practice or recording. Or throw Stratus on your existing pedalboard as a ""swiss-army knife"" to add any effect(s) you may need for your gig on the fly. You can leave those looper and tuner pedals at home! Once you've set up your effects chain, Stratus will save it even through a full reboot--no app necessary.</p>

</div></div></div></div></div></div>","Introducing: Stratus. The intelligent, all-in-one multi-tool for electric guitarists. Combining the capabilities of an online multi-effects platform, looper, and guitar tuner, Stratus is the perfect effects solution for beginner and advanced guitarists alike. Simply download the app, customize your effects, and you’re ready to rock!  Stratus is the flexible tool for your gear arsenal. You can have it substitute any pedal you might be missing on your board, or create entire digital pedalboards by chaining up to five effects together in any order you can imagine. It also functions as a looper and tuner!   Stratus has all the classic effects you know and love right out of the box, plus an array of brand new custom effects. Stratus' online effects library will be continually updated so you never run out of new effects to play with. Whether you want to sound like your favorite artist or craft a sound of your own, Stratus has you covered. ...and many more to come! 

 


 


 

 

 



 


 
Stratus was made by musicians, for musicians. Now you can seamlessly craft your sound no matter how or what you play. You won't find a more user friendly multi-effects platform.
 


 


The incredibly intuitive Chaos Audio app (available for both iOS and Android) allows you to control every aspect of Stratus via Bluetooth right from the palm of your hand. You can download new effects from the store, create and save different presets by chaining together up to five effects, and access a wide variety of new features as they become available. The app is also used to update the software running on Stratus, so as bugs and feature requests present themselves, we can take care of them through updates on a regular basis.
 


 
It's never been easier to build out unique presets and unleash your creativity. With the ability to chain up to five effects together in any order, Stratus serves as an excellent pedal for practice or recording. Or throw Stratus on your existing pedalboard as a ""swiss-army knife"" to add any effect(s) you may need for your gig on the fly. You can leave those looper and tuner pedals at home! Once you've set up your effects chain, Stratus will save it even through a full reboot--no app necessary.
 

 

With an online effects platform, Stratus will continue to get access to new and exciting effects. We'll be updating the platform on regular basis, and we plan to partner with different musicians and pedal manufacturers to create custom artist-series effects and verified pedal emulations. It's like the App Store... in a stompbox.

 


 
Stratus comes with a built-in looper that affords up to five minutes of recording time and an unlimited number of overdubs. Just click the knob to start recording! Stratus' looper functions like other single-button loopers, and the LEDs up top will guide you as you go from recording, to playback, to overdub modes.
 

 


 
Our high-accuracy tuner works with or without the app and has a plethora of different tunings. Hold down the stomp switch and use the built-in LEDs and auto-string detection to quickly get your instrument in tune. Or use the app to get an accurate measurement, down to the cents value!
 

We need your help to take our patent-pending design to mass production. Last November we secured venture capital investment through TechFarms Capital. That has allowed us to continue to iterate on and improve our design, but the initial batch of Stratus pedals will cost quite a bit to produce. The larger the initial production volume we can order, the higher the chance we'll be able to continue to scale at the same rapid pace, adding new features to Stratus through firmware updates and continuing to roll out new effects through the online platform!
 

 


 


 

Chaos Audio is a small group of engineers with a passion for music. The idea for Stratus was born out of necessity. As broke college students we couldn't afford to buy expensive guitar pedals. So we made our own. Now we need your help to bring this technology to everyone else!
We have taken Stratus from concept to reality in a year with minimal funding and we have many more exciting ideas for the future. We hope you can see the same potential in Stratus and the Chaos Audio brand.

We make the most of advanced scientific theory as well as using practical assessment to depict how BoomBocs ACADEMY performs in real life. It’s not just about facts, figures, and graphs; we use our ears to tell us what’s actually happening and that’s why it sounds as good as it does.</p><p>Too often these days, speakers are manipulated into producing a sound they cannot naturally create using digital signal processing (DSP). Whilst this isn't essentially wrong, we believe a speaker should make use of the natural environment by pushing air through the enclosure efficiently, creating its own sound. BoomBocs ACADEMY does exactly this; our specially designed enclosure and porting system is <strong>tuned to specific frequencies that sound pleasant to the human ear</strong>. We then fine tune using DSP rather than creating the sound with it. One thing you’ll notice about heavily DSP-dependent speakers is that they may sound good at low volume, but as it gets louder, the sculpted sound does not maintain it’s low-high ratio in a linear fashion. Instead, the low end thins out and it starts to sound weak.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1628498931/rttx50vynamad0k1mjok.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><strong>What is it you want from the low frequencies?</strong></p><p>You want it to pack a punch! You want to feel the kick drum in your chest! You don’t want the bass to rumble; you want it to fill the room and sooth your belly.</p><p><strong>What is it you want from the high frequencies?</strong></p><p>You want clarity! You want to decipher every lyric and hear the air in the vocalist’s breath.</p><p><strong>Well, what about the mids?</strong></p><p>What about them? You’re not supposed to notice those but they’ll be there providing the overall sound with all the body it requires.</p><p>BoomBocs ACADEMY maintains its <strong>pristine, balanced, signature sound</strong> no matter what volume it’s playing.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1625655730/oqt65zihnvjpze2ogqct.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3> </h3><h3>The BoomBocs Signature Sound</h3><p>It goes without saying that our founder (and chief acoustic engineer) putting his stamp of approval on BoomBocs products should be enough to vouch for the sound. Jonny’s extensive client list has some very impressive names on it, indeed. Just think, if you’re putting on a stadium show for 90,000 people, and one person is in charge of the sound for those 90,000 people, he’s going to be pretty decent at his job. Jonny’s audio wisdom has played a fundamental role in the development of the BoomBocs signature sound, <strong>always prioritising audio superiority over anything else.</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1628499134/p8mx0pn3il5hjo0utnap.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>We have a one-of-a-kind enclosure shape to help with air-flow efficiency and sound dispersion. Having speakers so close to each other can make it difficult to achieve true stereo imagery so we built a ‘ridge’ to angle our speakers outwards. In conjunction with the front face’s upward trajectory, BoomBocs ACADEMY disperses sound over a wider area, blessing the ears of everyone in the vicinity.</p><p>Our speaker drivers work in a two-way configuration, where the woofers (low frequency) and tweeters (high frequency) are separated. The woofers (funny word, isn’t it?) are comprised of coated paper, giving us an optimised rigidity for producing <strong>a sound that delivers clarity and great punch.</strong> The motor that drives the speaker is set further back than normal, which means the speaker can move further backwards and forwards, producing longer wavelength and extended frequency response, especially in the lower regions. The more a speaker physically moves, the more air it pushes and therefore the deeper and louder it can go.</p><p>To maintain clarity throughout the entire frequency spectrum, we use fabric tweeters with a silk surround. Their motors are based on neodymium magnets, meaning they’re <strong>extremely lightweight and highly responsive, allowing for lightning-fast movement.</strong> The featherweight fabric further enables us to move the tweeter diaphragms back and forth extremely quickly. The faster they can move, the higher the frequencies can be produced; some so high only dogs can hear them.</p><p>Another little secret we’ll share with you relates to our “BoomBocs reflex port” which is effectively a hole in the back of the enclosure for air to escape. Its main purpose is to extend the low frequencies, ensuring a <strong>tight, punchy, deep bass</strong> is achieved. Our unconventional port design features a specifically-designed tunnel, calculated precisely to give us the required tuning for our sound.<br/><br/>On-board is an adjustable EQ for the user to tweak their preferred sound according to personal taste.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1628499218/s6uzkbirysmgegcimq7v.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3> </h3><h3>Giving to Charity: Rays of Sunshine</h3><p>We feel passionately about giving back to the world and helping those in need.

Our speaker designs adhere to the same core values that have defined our brand’s musical and audio spirit, drawing on the world-renowned British musical heritage we all know and love.New for 2021 comes the BoomBocs ACADEMY; derived from the retro styling of the original portable speaker, our modern-day classic has spent years in the making.The main aim of this Indiegogo campaign is to raise the awareness of our brand and to give early adopters the opportunity to be part of our epic creation. We have it ready to go with our manufacturing partner, we just need to place that initial order to get the ball rolling. How Can You Help & What Do You Get?Our aim is to become a household name for consumer electronics and speaker technology so to do this we would like to raise £60,000, allowing us to hit ‘go’ on production. We want BoomBocs ACADEMY to be affordable for everyone without compromising on audio quality, functionality, or aesthetics.We're offering you the chance to get your hands on your very own BoomBocs ACADEMY smart wireless speaker before anyone else. You can even get a limited-edition version that won’t be available at any other time apart from now.Other rewards range from merchandise; to once-in-a-lifetime adventures; to unique combos.By helping BoomBocs, you’re helping put a brand that cares about music into the big world of consumer electronics. We are going to finally show people what audio quality is all about!If for any reason our target is not reached, funds raised from the campaign will still go towards building a production batch so you WILL receive any Perk you have purchased. What is the 2021 BoomBocs ACADEMY?Everybody loves a bit of nostalgia, and BoomBocs ACADEMY aims to bring back the original 'look' of the 80s boombox but fully loaded with modern technology. Now you’ll be able to connect wirelessly via WiFi, Bluetooth, DAB radio or FM radio.  Our internet radio service gives you access to over 50,000 worldwide stations, as well as podcasts, episodes and 'listen again' services.Our app for Android and iOS devices makes life extremely easy when streaming direct from Spotify HiFi, Deezer, and Amazon Music. Wait, Spotify HiFi?Yep! BoomBocs is one of the world's first wireless speakers to give full access to Spotify's new CD-quality audio streaming service. If you haven't heard about Spotify HiFi yet, it's essentially music streaming in lossless format, matching that of CD-quality. For the audiophiles, Spotify Premium's previous bit rate maxed out at 320kbps. With Spotify HiFi, you're getting lossless audio up to 1411kbps. For those less nerdy, lossless audio files essentially carry more data, giving you more detail in the audio so it's good news!Our unique 2-way speaker design, coupled with intelligent frequency management, high-performance digital amplifier and specifically designed bass reflex port ensure BoomBocs ACADEMY’s superior sound quality puts it above competitors. This, along with its unique aesthetics make it an extremely desirable wireless sound system.For those that like to keep it ‘old school’ we’ve even got a 3.5mm auxiliary input and stereo RCAs for cable connection. And for those that like to keep it REALLY old school, we’ve built in a stereo phono connection and pre-amp for your record player so you can play your precious vinyls at the best possible quality.The karaoke enthusiasts out there are invited to the party by utilising the XLR mic input with dedicated gain control on the back. PressBoomBocs speakers have been toured and used by highly acclaimed recording artists throughout recent years. Their durability and sturdy construction have made them the choice of musicians such as Steven Tyler, Tom Petty, Rita Ora, Kylie Minogue and Lady Gaga.In 2018 BoomBocs v2.0 was nominated for ‘Best Wireless Speaker’ by T3 Magazine. We’ve also been feature in publications worldwide, receiving rave reviews from established media. Trusted Reviews even rated the BoomBocs v2.0 4.5 out of 5 stars. Let's Get TechnicalHow do you describe a sound? Well, the answer is with great difficulty! Trying to explain how impressive something sounds without hearing it is no easy task but given our expertise in this field, you can rest assured we know what we’re doing when it comes to the remarkable BoomBocs signature sound.In order to ensure BoomBocs ACADEMY is at the forefront of smart acoustics, we have incorporated some very unique design features. We make the most of advanced scientific theory as well as using practical assessment to depict how BoomBocs ACADEMY performs in real life. It’s not just about facts, figures, and graphs; we use our ears to tell us what’s actually happening and that’s why it sounds as good as it does.Too often these days, speakers are manipulated into producing a sound they cannot naturally create using digital signal processing (DSP). Whilst this isn't essentially wrong, we believe a speaker should make use of the natural environment by pushing air through the enclosure efficiently, creating its own sound. BoomBocs ACADEMY does exactly this; our specially designed enclosure and porting system is tuned to specific frequencies that sound pleasant to the human ear. We then fine tune using DSP rather than creating the sound with it. One thing you’ll notice about heavily DSP-dependent speakers is that they may sound good at low volume, but as it gets louder, the sculpted sound does not maintain it’s low-high ratio in a linear fashion. Instead, the low end thins out and it starts to sound weak. What is it you want from the low frequencies?You want it to pack a punch! You want to feel the kick drum in your chest! You don’t want the bass to rumble; you want it to fill the room and sooth your belly.What is it you want from the high frequencies?You want clarity! You want to decipher every lyric and hear the air in the vocalist’s breath.Well, what about the mids?What about them? You’re not supposed to notice those but they’ll be there providing the overall sound with all the body it requires.BoomBocs ACADEMY maintains its pristine, balanced, signature sound no matter what volume it’s playing. The BoomBocs Signature SoundIt goes without saying that our founder (and chief acoustic engineer) putting his stamp of approval on BoomBocs products should be enough to vouch for the sound. Jonny’s extensive client list has some very impressive names on it, indeed. Just think, if you’re putting on a stadium show for 90,000 people, and one person is in charge of the sound for those 90,000 people, he’s going to be pretty decent at his job. Jonny’s audio wisdom has played a fundamental role in the development of the BoomBocs signature sound, always prioritising audio superiority over anything else.We have a one-of-a-kind enclosure shape to help with air-flow efficiency and sound dispersion. Having speakers so close to each other can make it difficult to achieve true stereo imagery so we built a ‘ridge’ to angle our speakers outwards. In conjunction with the front face’s upward trajectory, BoomBocs ACADEMY disperses sound over a wider area, blessing the ears of everyone in the vicinity.Our speaker drivers work in a two-way configuration, where the woofers (low frequency) and tweeters (high frequency) are separated. The woofers (funny word, isn’t it?) are comprised of coated paper, giving us an optimised rigidity for producing a sound that delivers clarity and great punch. The motor that drives the speaker is set further back than normal, which means the speaker can move further backwards and forwards, producing longer wavelength and extended frequency response, especially in the lower regions. The more a speaker physically moves, the more air it pushes and therefore the deeper and louder it can go.To maintain clarity throughout the entire frequency spectrum, we use fabric tweeters with a silk surround. Their motors are based on neodymium magnets, meaning they’re extremely lightweight and highly responsive, allowing for lightning-fast movement. The featherweight fabric further enables us to move the tweeter diaphragms back and forth extremely quickly. The faster they can move, the higher the frequencies can be produced; some so high only dogs can hear them.Another little secret we’ll share with you relates to our “BoomBocs reflex port” which is effectively a hole in the back of the enclosure for air to escape. Its main purpose is to extend the low frequencies, ensuring a tight, punchy, deep bass is achieved. Our unconventional port design features a specifically-designed tunnel, calculated precisely to give us the required tuning for our sound.On-board is an adjustable EQ for the user to tweak their preferred sound according to personal taste. Giving to Charity: Rays of SunshineWe feel passionately about giving back to the world and helping those in need. We've teamed up with a fantastic children's charity, Rays of Sunshine, and have agreed to pledge £5 from the sale of EVERY BoomBocs ACADEMY during this Indiegogo Campaign. The money we raise will go towards brightening the lives of seriously ill children across the UK, aged three to 18 by granting wishes and providing ongoing support in hospitals.To find out more about Rays of Sunshine and the work they do, visit their website @ raysofsunshine.org.uk Our HeritageWe’re immensely proud to be British, establishing ourselves in the vibrant borough of Brixton, South London many moons ago. The rich musical heritage of Britain (as a whole) has played an integral part in influencing BoomBocs, both the brand and the products. However, it’s not only the likes of The Beatles, Pink Floyd and David Bowie that have provided us with inspiration; it’s also those genius’ that have lurked in the background, making audio engineering breakthroughs to take music forward with technology.  So, to Rupert Neve, Joe Meek and all those super boffins at EMI Abbey Road in the 1960s and 70s that invented machines to make sounds or improve sounds, we salute you. You are our heroes! The VisionOur goal for this year is to build our first production batch of BoomBocs ACADEMY smart speakers and get them out by Christmas 2021.We also have long-term goals for developing both smaller and larger BoomBocs systems to expand our family. We’ll take on more staff, with a focus on creating jobs for younger people in all aspects of business and creative practise. Why We'll SucceedThere is no stopping us! The world needs a wireless smart speaker like BoomBocs ACADEMY so we're 100% committed to getting you yours!

</div></div>","Meet MUZEN CyberShell, an astonishing cyberage sound innovation that aims to bring you a unique listening audio experience in everyday daily life. It offers excellent sound quality, extra deep bass, stereo surround sound, and full RGB lights that make it easy to immerse yourself in virtual reality.
Equipped with dual speakers and a 10W x 48mm full-range sound capacity, CyberShell can perfectly cover high and mid-bass, detect dynamic changes between sound levels and restore realistic sound effects. Its loud and high-quality sound wave flows seamlessly through every corner of the room, creating an immersive sound experience.


Inspired by the performance design of the spaceship spoiler, CyberShell has deeply optimized the bass performance: The passive radiator greatly enhances the bass effect of the music, achieving visual and tactile dual sensory stimulation.


With 3 audio modes: normal mode*, rock mode**, and rap mode***, it can create different playback sound effects to meet individual needs and give you more enjoyment of the music. 

*Three-band balanced vocal effect allows harmonic treble and amplified basses.
**Focuses on rock music and offers you the ultimate listening experience.
***Highlights the vocal hierarchy and rhythm of rap music.
The personalized full RGB lights create a dynamic light effect that changes with the sound and gives you a cool cyber atmosphere.

It has 3 lighting modes: permanent, gradient and breathing.


Inspired by spaceships in the galaxy that combine both mechanical aesthetics and technological elements, CyberShell's body is made of a zinc alloy metal structure that adds a virtual and futuristic touch to the design.


Thanks to the classic control structure of the gears and buttons, CyberShell gives you irresistible control satisfaction by producing a crisp click sound when you toggle it.

The outer shell of the CyberShell uses a zinc alloy that requires special processes such as spraying and electroplating, making it heavier and more stable than conventional metals and has a metallic surface. The shield gives CyberShell greater stability when playing crazy bass, making your room shake with the sound wave, but the speaker does not.


Keep the hits coming all night long! Enjoy up to 13 hours of playtime with crystal-clear audio that lasts as long as you do.

*The 13-hour battery life is based on 50% volume without lighting.
**Other conditional factors may affect the battery life.
With Bluetooth 5.0, Type-C and AUX, CyberShell can stream music smoothly from your phone, tablet, laptop or any other devices. 

In TWS mode,  CyberShell A and B can form the left and right channels as independent stereo speakers.

*Two MUZEN devices of the same model are required to activate the TWS mode.
You can also use a pair of CyberShells as individual left and right channels without latency for your personal setup by connecting an adapter.

With a low latency of up to 60ms and the elimination of voice echoes, the CyberShell offers gamers an exciting gaming experience.

*Sound quality and Bluetooth transmission distance will be affected in this mode.
Just bring the epic music wherever you go! Compared to those traditional bulky speakers, CyberShell weighs only 1.05kg and is wireless,  which could be easily carried around when you are chilling at home, taking a shower, attending a party, working out or during road trips.
You don't need to rely on a device to operate your CyberShell. Do everything you need just with the buttons on your speaker.

Keep jamming without worrying about of water getting into your speaker. The water-resistant CyberShell is designed to play in less perfect conditions, so your music never has to stop.


Inspired by spaceships, CyberShell brings people a brand-new visual system speaker that the market has never seen before. Uniquely designed, the high-quality hard metal, mechanical exoskeleton shell, knobs in various shapes, and an astonishing halo reveal the ultimate product style of cyberpunk.With its unpredictable lighting and effects emerging in the atmosphere, CyberShell is perfect as a desktop speaker, offering you the shock of two speakers and two intelligent interconnections. It is built for your convenience and does not need to be controlled by an app. All playback functions can be controlled with simple and physical knobs or buttons. The goal is to provide people with a one-of-a-kind listening experience and visual impact that does not exist with previous speakers.

The product is currently in the second phase of production to continuously refine CyberShell's audio-visual effects and provide users with a better overall product experience.

As a token of gratitude to our early backers for being confident in the quality of MUZEN CyberShell, all perks during this campaign will come with a one-year warranty.

If you have any concerns or problems using CyberShell, please send us an email to info@muzenaudio.com and our team will be happy to assist you.

Jammy EVO is also available in a left-handed version!

 

 

With Jammy EVO, you will get 15 regular-sized frets, the latency as low as 8—10 ms, and clean MIDI output at an affordable price.  

 
Please note that the little box on the EVO's back will only be present at the early prototype stage. Apart from accurate polyphonic tracking and filtering out the unintended notes so you don’t have to edit your score manually, Jammy EVO provides you with handy Playability Extensions: Jammy EVO’s multi-channel MIDI output will allow you to assign different instruments to each string. How about playing drums on the lower E, dropping a bass line on A and D, then adding piano to the mix on G, B, and higher E without even having to switch among the instruments? You love the guitar for the expressive means it provides, doubting that any MIDI controller can replicate them? Although Jammy EVO has a slightly different ‘feel’ than an analog instrument, with it, you’ll still be able to use the techniques like bending, hammer-ons, pull-offs, palm muting, left-hand muting and slides in your MIDI recordings.Moreover, its mappable controls and built-in accelerometer will allow you to change parameters of filters and FX on the fly, giving your expressiveness yet another dimension!
 



 

With Jammy EVO, it’s just plug and play — all you got to do is connect it to your computer, tablet, or phone via USB-C or wirelessly using Bluetooth.  

 
 


 

Jammy EVO is a class-compliant MIDI controller so it’ll work with any DAW (Ableton Live, GarageBand, Logic Pro, etc), virtual instrument, or notation software that accepts MIDI input!




 

The Jammy EVO VST plugin will make your experience seamless, allowing you to adjust your Jammy EVO from inside the DAW you’re using by changing tunings, sensitivity settings, and more.


 


 
 


Please note that the little box on the EVO's back will only be present at the early prototype stage — all the electronics will be neatly placed inside the EVO's body in the next iteration! 




 


Jammy In-Tuition is a music production course that consists of video lessons, interactive practices, and hands-on examples, with which you will learn how to:
understand the inner workings of music — beats, sound intervals, chord progressions
see and use the dynamics between harmony and melody
find sources for your ideas and bring those ideas to life with confidence and efficiency
record tracks with Jammy EVO in a DAW, master and distribute your creations



 The reward price doesn't include a shipping price and any customs duties, taxes, fees, or any other country-specific charges, or brokerage fees.

You can control your device through tap, gesture, and voice controls—all on Sentien Audio.  Put it on in the morning and forget about wearing it. Just like your wristwatch. No ear fatigue. Stay aware of your surroundings. Communicate and listen naturally.  Don't take our word for it — see people's reactions to trying the headset for the first time.   Bone conduction technology sends audio directly to your inner ear, and serotonin straight to your brain. You don't just hear your music like you're at a concert—you feel it in your bones. ...that you're listening to Miley Cyrus' 'The Climb' on repeat at the office. You're the only one who can hear it, whether you’re waiting for the subway or carpooling home.      Even if you're working from home, Sentien Audio's noise-cancelling microphones make your Zoom meeting feel like you're face to face. Minus your barking dog. You’ll feel the difference the first time you slide Sentien Audio into place. Adjust the size of the titanium band to perfectly fit your head size and shape. The ergonomic design will make it seem like the headset vanished.  The white mark is only a reference to show the adjustment in action. Not just different sizes. Different shapes as well.  Over 10 hours of continuous playback of your favorite heavy metal playlist. Or make one charge last for days with normal use.     You can customize the commands you want to use in the Sentien Connect app. Upgrade Sentien Audio with new functions as we continue adding features.Each side of the headset supports 6 intuitive gestures. Configure each gesture to perform the action you want in the Sentien Connect app. Create even more custom actions with 3rd party applications. Play / Pause action via Tap. Choose the gesture, and assign it an action.  Now your voice assistant goes with you everywhere for instant access as natural as a conversation. Activate your favorite AI assistant with a gesture of your choice.   Trigger your favorite AI assistant with a gesture of your choice.  Universal USB-C Charging. Let's talk more human now. We use Sentien Audio prototypes daily.  I am editing this page and listening to music and the reaction videos via Sentien Audio prototype.We were at the pre-production stage.

We rented an office together to have a space to brainstorm, organize hackathons, and theorize about information theory and ethics.Along the way I met Darek, who was working as a designer of unmanned aircraft and studying industrial design at a university. He was extremely resourceful and we could talk for ages about old Mercedes cars he was fixing and selling.Off and on, we worked on ergonomics, testing, prototyping the basic shapes for the headset, and went over multitudes of iterations to come up with the most ergonomic shape.From 2019 on, we had a good idea about the shape, electronic parts needed, the main use cases, and the software stack needed to create and share the experience with you.We’ve spent thousands of hours perfecting Sentien Audio’s design, ergonomics, and software.

It is true what people say, music moves the soul. I first listened to cassette on cheap Japanese mass produced system in the 1970s. When I heard a true hifi system for the first time, I was floored. I built my first amplifier when I was 14 and it has been my hobby for the last 35 years. Back in those days, it was impossible to DIY anything closely resembling the performance of a commercial Hifi system. All that changed about 10 years ago – it can be described in one word – the Internet. The internet means it is now possible to buy high quality speaker drivers, exchange notes through forums and accurately model the performance your loudspeakers before building it. As I was trained both as a physicist and electronic engineer, I am comfortable tweaking the entire signal chain from the signal source to the speakers. I also realized how much there is to gain if you were to design the system as a whole allowing the different part of the signal chain (DSP, amplifier, speaker drivers and cabinets) to collaborate resulting in higher performance, more compact size and lower cost. If you want to understand what does that mean, could you imagine your handphone sounding this loud and clear 20 years ago? It basically threw out what I perceive Hifi should look like, big ugly clunky speakers with expensive components etc. Enigma is the result of this paradigm shift.</p><h3><strong>The Team</strong></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1614928461/mwiojjfdipsm1f47g63y.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Oon Chin Hin (Left, Founder) received his PhD in Nanotechnology from the National University of Singapore back in 2003 and has worked in R&amp;D in everything from semiconductor manufacturing to LEDs to solar cells.

TV inputs will automatically switch to the right input, so you don't have to worry about an extra switching and wiring that you have to do with a Audio Video Receiver (AVR). With our generous low end bass output, you won't really miss the subwoofer. Since the speaker and amplifier are designed to match each other via DSP, you don't even have to worry you might accidentally ""blow"" your speakers when somebody fires the cannon.... ManufacturingThe speakers are assembled in Singapore with the parts from all over the world, the wooden spheres from Thailand, the speaker drivers from Indonesia and Germany and the electronics from China. By utilising this approach, we are not burdened by tooling cost for mould (they are very expensive) as well as the cost to run production for a minimum of 10000 units or more. That is why we could go for such a low minimum funding cost. However the spheres takes 3 months to cut, dry and finish. We have pre-ordered 100pcs of spheres and just waiting for them to be shipped over, so if all goes well we can start shipping our first batch a few weeks after our campaign closes in April.Why do we want your support?More than just helping us fund our first full production run, what we really want is your feedback. Tell us what you like or don’t like about our product and how we can improve. Tell us what you think about everything from the way the speaker sounds, to the shape and the finish of the speakers. There is still opportunity for change before we go into full production.My journey in audioI loved music from an early age listening to my dad’s old car stereo. It is true what people say, music moves the soul. I first listened to cassette on cheap Japanese mass produced system in the 1970s. When I heard a true hifi system for the first time, I was floored. I built my first amplifier when I was 14 and it has been my hobby for the last 35 years. Back in those days, it was impossible to DIY anything closely resembling the performance of a commercial Hifi system. All that changed about 10 years ago – it can be described in one word – the Internet. The internet means it is now possible to buy high quality speaker drivers, exchange notes through forums and accurately model the performance your loudspeakers before building it. As I was trained both as a physicist and electronic engineer, I am comfortable tweaking the entire signal chain from the signal source to the speakers. I also realized how much there is to gain if you were to design the system as a whole allowing the different part of the signal chain (DSP, amplifier, speaker drivers and cabinets) to collaborate resulting in higher performance, more compact size and lower cost. If you want to understand what does that mean, could you imagine your handphone sounding this loud and clear 20 years ago? It basically threw out what I perceive Hifi should look like, big ugly clunky speakers with expensive components etc. Enigma is the result of this paradigm shift.The TeamOon Chin Hin (Left, Founder) received his PhD in Nanotechnology from the National University of Singapore back in 2003 and has worked in R&D in everything from semiconductor manufacturing to LEDs to solar cells. He is a scientist by day but comes sundown he becomes a DIY audiophile maverick constructer. Stanley Tay (Right, Co-Founder) was an accountant before he realized it is not a fun profession if you are a techie. He now runs his own company in lighting and constantly looking out for the next cool thing to check out. We both feel nothing beats the real world experience, whether listening to music that will bring you to euphoria or being in a beautiful place in a beautiful time surrounded by mesmerizing fairy lights. Hence our venture in Enigma…",23.0,0,"1 Campaign

</ul></div>","[日本語訳リンク @ peblwear.com] The ProblemGood music have always empowered my life.And the music apps helped expand the music experience.However the problem exists, in many of an active occasion.And a suitable option to solve the problem, doesn't exist. The Problem #1 | HassleWhat was the volume up command??We know the Apple Music, Spotify, Amazon music track curation are not always perfect. And we don’t always grab the phone. Siri doesn't exactly do what we want. Earbuds remotes has its own language. The Problem #2 | UnsafeTouch buttons are too small to tap while moving. Look ahead !!   What if we can listen to the best track in right volume, in the right moment?↓The Solution Swipe. Slide. Hold.Three simple gestures, carefully placed on palm size curved surface, directly responds to your fingertips.Works directly, or through your pocket of favorite jeans, workout pants, cyclewear or backpack.  
PEBLWEAR | TechnologyDesign is based on prototyping and everyday field test, every knowledge being in nature and the human interface design, are applied into this product.Combining the industry standard wireless technology, and durable and reliable design, PEBLWEAR is designed to enjoy its experience as long as we want. 

Patent pending Tangible Touch technology 
Pebble sized curved touch surface brings the one and only tangible control at your fingertips. You can feel the gestures by your hand, and through your pocket, so you don’t need to look at [ Patent Pending ]. The size, thickness, curves, material texture, are all precisely engineered for easy control in active occasion. And it is already in the cycle of design optimization in my everyday life.  


Simple gestures by captive touch sensorSwipe. Slide. Hold. Directly reads your fingertips, and sends out the sound controls just after the gesture recognition. PEBLWEAR have placed the same technology as touchscreen on smartphones under the pebble sized curved touch surface. It is designed to work through textiles which is not too thick (Intelligent algorithm automatically calibrates when touch surface has stable contact to the textile ) . Jeans, workout pants, thin gloves and backpacks are tested.

 


Wireless, low energy, and long lasting design 
Connects with industry standard wireless technology ""Bluetooth-HID"". Ultra low energy design realizes the several month battery life, and the battery is swappable. Durable and minimal structure realized by 3D formed plastic. Water, shock and dust resistant. 


PEBLWEAR App to tailor your experience 
The optional PEBLWEAR app, makes the experience much easy and tailored to your needs. Future updates and additional features planned to be provided through the app.

  
PEBLWEAR | ExperienceBased on everyday life with music and activity in nature.

Make beats, play keys, launch clips - °Grid fits any style and skill level. It’s instantly compatible with all of your existing devices - just pair & play.
 
°Grid employs LED-backlit, velocity-sensitive silicone pads and a unique multi-directional modulation Joystick. Think of it as a pocket, MPC-style Drumpad, Keyboard and haptic controller in one. The lightweight, responsive design will help capture your creative ideas wherever you are. °Grid will keep running all day long on a single charge, so you can go from sketch to masterpiece without skipping a beat. A free, companion editor app (iOS / Android) lets you store any configuration as a preset and recall on-the-fly. Whether you’re looking for the lightest, hassle-free way to sketch out an idea on the go, want to add depth and expression to your performance, control your hardware hands-on, learn an exciting new instrument in no time, or jam with your friends and share the awesomeness with your feed.— realizing your creative potential has never been more fun or instantly rewarding!   °Grid will change the way you capture your creative ideas and bring your vision to life — it's the ultimate, take-anywhere, play-anything companion.    
°Grid pairs with any iOS / Android / macOS & Windows PC device via Bluetooth® LE or USB Type-C in a matter of seconds. It maps MIDI (MPE) parameters to its minimalist interface to control and play any compatible App or external Hardware.
 

 
°Grid is compatible with hundreds of iOS and Android apps as well as DAW's (Digital Audio Workstations) out of the box.

Whatever you want to do, there’s an App for that — and the coolest thing about it: °Grid probably already made friends with yours. But that's not all —it is also fully customizable and adapts to any use-case, whether you're a pro or just starting out. 
 

 
°Grid lets you switch between freely customizable configurations (presets) on-the-fly, mid-performance.
 

 

 
°Grid transcends your digital experience through the versatility, responsiveness, and fun of playing a real instrument but with the amazing capabilities and comfort of a pocket-sized mobile device.
 

 
To put it simply: °Grid offers the most immediate, expressive and versatile way to bring your creative ideas to life. If you can dream it - °Grid can play it.  
 A truly expressive instrument becomes an extension of your personality.    Shake it, bend it, dance with it — °Grid will translate every movement, touch, and gesture with precision and fluidity.  A built-in iNEMO™ Ultra-low-power, inertial module with an AI Machine Learning Core combines the power of a 3D accelerometer and a 3D gyroscope to map any gesture to any parameter — to put it simply: °Grid becomes a natural extension of your body.     One of °Grid most prominent features is a unique multi-directional Made-in-Japan modulation Joystick. 
 
 
Now you can use your digits, thumbs or paws — there can never be enough YOU in the flow.
 

 

You can assign any of the User-Interface elements to any  MIDI (MPE) parameter of your choice, using the free companion editor (iOS/Android)


Multidirectional Modulation Joystick (continuous data stream).
2x2 Transport pad-Grid (Velocity-sensitive, LED-backlit, color-customizable).
4x4 Performance pad-Grid (Velocity-sensitive, LED-backlit).
Accelerometer (continuous data stream).
Gyroscope (continuous data stream).
Gestural Machine Learning (AI) Core.

 

 
Mapping parameters is as easy as drag & drop and will let you control far more than just Music Apps. You can build and animate 3D visuals, control hardware, launch clips, like something out of Minority Report. 

 Any configuration can be saved as a preset, with 16 banks allowing for 16 presets each - that's a total of 256 individual presets that can be switched on-the-fly, standalone, mid-performance. 

 

  
Think globally, act locally — is not just a motto.  From PCB through Enclosure to biodegradable packaging, °Grid is proudly designed and made in Austria, Europe.   
Being an instrument by nature, we ensure the long-lasting °Grid usage through lightweight but extraordinarily durable materials — sourced and produced locally and with a clean conscience.

<strong>WHAT IS</strong> the<br/><strong>LivingRoom Upright Piano</strong>?</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The LivingRoom Upright Piano - Complete Edition is a <strong>software model</strong> of a vintage character upright piano from the south of Sweden. The core of this software was made by recording the original piece thousands of times, in multiple ways and with multiple microphone recording positions to make a <strong>versatile</strong>, <strong>accurate and detailed virtual model</strong> of the real piano.<strong> </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619303463/mozifjca8arher9yigsn.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><br/> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>What makes it special?</strong></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">A few years ago I, Anders Eklöv, had a vision for making a software model of a piano that sounds like an upright piano does when used for a few years after tuning. When some of the strings in each key become slightly out of tune. A classic home piano sound, or if you will, a ""living room upright piano"" sound. So, prior to recording the sounds for this product, I had the piano tuned to that specific point and the result is a recorded piano with a very high sense of realism. Not nearly as out of whack to resemble a honky-tonk piano, nor as perfect as a pristine grand piano, which come in great supply on the market already. Just slightly out of tune.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The sound of the piano is a classic upright piano sound. It <strong>is</strong> vintage, but does not <strong>sound</strong> vintage. It sounds like what it is - a good quality, large body upright piano with lots of character and intimate tone, for situations requiring realism and a genuine sounding instrument.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;margin-bottom:-10px;"">FEATURES</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;margin-bottom:22px;""><strong>OF LIVINGROOM UPRIGHT PIANO</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;line-height: 1.9em;""><strong>To accurately model the original piece in the digital realm over 4200 recordings were made in groups ranging from sustained notes to acoustical behavioral sounds and noises and played back through the advanced piano playback engine in the virtual piano.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;margin-bottom:-15px;""><strong>Sustained note recordings - pedal on &amp; off</strong></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;font-size: 1.13em;color: #555;"">Nuance and dynamic range through multiple sensitivity layers.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">All keys of the piano were sampled/recorded 26 times in different groups. The main group is the sustained notes, the ones you hear while pressing down a key. Two sets of sustains were recorded in their full length, one with the pedal unpressed and another with the pedal pressed. The length and sound character is quite different between these and they play an important role in realistically reproducing any piano.<br/> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>3 Close Stereo Microphone positions</strong></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622090271/zbefpnsr7cm2l5wy4hfd.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The complete set of recordings were made in 3 separate simultaneous stereo microphone positions. The first from the front near the strings (the ""player position""), the second one below the keyboard and the third on the rear of the piano body, where sound is let out through two openings. These positions are all close microphone positions that reflect that part of the piano body's most intimate sound. They differ quite a bit in tonality making the piano very versatile and adjustable and can easily blend into any sound or mix. Using the mixer of the virtual instrument you can adjust all components recorded independently for all three positions.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Dynamic Range control</strong></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622093249/lpaikdd4cmprq3z5vnox.png"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/>An essential piece of a software piano, as opposed to the physical original, is the ability of adjusting the maximum difference between the strongest recording and the softest for each key. Through the <strong>Dynamic Range knob</strong> you can adjust this either explosive or seamless volume differences in between the recorded sensitivities, so your result matches your song or performance expectations. After all, the dynamic difference in volume is often compressed away, through a compressor or limiter, which many times make most piano tracks sound worse. This feature gets you quicker to your desired sound, circumventing excessive compression.</p>

</div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Acoustical modelling and detail</strong></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><br/><strong>Releasing the key - String dampening and Key release sounds</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Depicting acoustical behavior as the key is released.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">When you <strong>release the key</strong> of a played note (<i>without having pressed the sustain pedal</i>) two things happen in a real piano. The key's mechanical parts give off a release noise and the damper will silence the played note, both of which were captured quite extensively for this product.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The <strong>dampening of the strings</strong> is an important thing in trying to mimic the sound of an acoustic piano. Depending on how long you hold the note and how hard you strike the key, the sound of your stings being dampened will change very much. A quick note has more of a harsh, explosive sound while a normal, longer note creates a less sharp and smoother dampening sound.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Both <strong>staccato</strong> (shorter) and <strong>normal</strong> longer held notes's <strong>dampening sounds</strong> were captured in multiple time intervals as well as velocity (strength), for a full sonic range. Through the piano playback engine the String Dampening sounds are selected polyphonically and follow both the strength of your playing and the time elapsed since you pressed the key. Tone, timing, AHDSR Envelopes and equalization is then applied for the closest match of the original piano's sound character.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The mechanical Key Release sounds follow the same principles but can also be adjusted to add or subtract from the Dynamic Range setting, which at high settings can make the sounds drop out entirely at soft key strokes.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Via the <strong>Release Length slider</strong> you can shorten the length of string dampening and mechanical noises, for more explosive or quicker playing styles. Both release sounds can be adjusted in the user interface of the virtual piano, for all three microphone positions.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>String &amp; Body Resonances</strong></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Modelling the original piano's internal acoustics.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The internal acoustics of the piano box/body was recorded using Impulse Response reverb technology, also called Convolution Reverb, which captures a resonance of an acoustical environment. Two separate resonances were captured, the piano box/body's internal reverb as a whole and a separate one recorded very near the strings, capturing the piano strings resonating. These are additions you can use in your own desired portion and can give a very nice addition of more overtones for wider sounds and more resonant sounding machinery, much like the original piano.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">When connected to the sustain pedal actions, you will hear the same effect of the piano sound ""swelling"" as when you press the pedal on an actual piano. String Resonance gives you an added sense of the presence of the strings while the Body  Resonance adds more of the acoustics of the box.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">
<br/><strong>Put a lid on it!</strong>
</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">While the piano comes with an intimate sound character, the ""Lids/Panels"" (open/semi-open/closed) feature lets you encapsulate the sound for a less bright and sometimes more accurate experience, creating the natural sound of an upright piano with the panels attached, not removed/open as your would record it in most situations. Combined with the Body Resonance feature you can make a very resonant sounding piano and then close the lid on the sound, for that classic ""boxy"" upright sound, while placing your instrument as a whole in the desired environment in your mix.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Analog-style User Interface<br/>with Performance and Mixer View</strong></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1618961198/vuptuf02eumavxfuvudz.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The performance view will give you all the control over the in-the-box adjustments you will need to adjust the intimacy or grandeur of your sound. Using custom volume adjustment for all sound and effect sources you can adjust the note fade-out / decay time, the string dampening and mechanical key release sounds and how they follow what you play. String and piano body resonances are adjusted for all 3 microphone positions on the main performance view and can either follow the actions of your sustain pedalling, or stay on all the time as an effect.<br/> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">ADVANCED PIANO AUDIO<br/>PLAYBACK ENGINE</h3>
<p>Running it all is our custom coded audio playback engine for accurate reproduction of the piano recordings, currently in pre-beta development. A portion of the piano playback engine features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>adjustable note decay time</li>
<li>custom realistic polyphonic voice blending and fade-out of repeated notes, for accuracy</li>
<li>Accurate String Dampening &amp; Key Release sounds with time and velocity matrix</li>
<li>Authentic Pedal Behaviour - volume and accent follows your playing style</li>
<li>Impulse Response modelled Body &amp; String Resonances with sustain pedal interaction</li>

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
</div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>WHO IS IT FOR?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Pianists, keyboardists, musicians &amp; people learning to play the piano</li>
<li>Music producers, song writers and composers of all kinds</li>
<li>Film composers who need high quality alternative piano sounds</li>
<li>Producers working on records with lots of piano based songs, where diversity is desirable</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>HOW DO I USE IT?</strong></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">SAMPLER FORMATS &amp; PLATFORMS</p>
<p>As a finished software piano it will run in a sampler software on either Windows or macOS. Linux as well if you have the right tools. The sampler formats that are supported are the Native Instruments <strong>Kontakt sampler</strong>, <strong>SFZ</strong> &amp; <strong>EXS24</strong>. The latter is the format used in Logic Pro X, GarageBand and MainStage and will include smart control patches. SFZ is an open source format that can be used in built-in samplers of many different DAWs, but no matter what music program you have you can always use Sforzando, a free sample player for macOS and Windows. While the entire set of sustained note recordings are available for all formats, the acoustical modelling is only fully realizable in Kontakt as a format, as it requires custom scripting to work properly.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>What stuff do I need to be able to play the piano?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>a computer, laptop or desktop, running Windows or macOS.</li>
<li>either a <strong>music program</strong> (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">DAW</a>) or a <strong>sampler software</strong> of the supported type.</li>
<li>preferably a <strong>digital piano</strong>, <strong>stage piano</strong> , a <strong>synthesizer</strong> or a <strong>midi keyboard</strong> with either midi output or midi-over-usb to the computer to be able to play the instrument 'live'.</li>

<h3>Backing our project: what´s a 'perk' and what am I getting?</h3>
<p>A ""perk"" is an item or a set of items or rewards you will receive when you invest a certain predefined amount. Here on Indiegogo they are the same as a ""Pledge"" on Kickstarter projects. At the top-right you will see the alternatives available <i>(on mobile: at the top, or as ""select a perk"" below</i>).</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When a Perk sells out, the perk goes away and another may take it´s place, but the earlier you invest the less you will pay, as price goes up every time a tier sells out. Apart from these ""perks"" a backer can also choose to enter their own desired backing amount of their choice. Any backer who backs the project in between two perks pricing will be awarded all perks that are valued less than or the same as the amount entered. This will be handled manually and be delivered to the Indiegogo registered email upon completion of the project, at product delivery/ fulfillment.</p>
<p><i>For more questions, read through the FAQ section or message us via support@keypleezer.com. </i></p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">DELIVERY DATES &amp; FULFILLMENT</h3>
<p>To see what your perks include you can read the description of the perk itself. For the delivery dates we set the following time tables.</p>
<ul>
<li>Complete Edition Digital Downloads - Late June 2021 - early July 2021.</li>

<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> Challenges &amp; Pitfalls</h3>
<p>Kontakt Sampler as a format is our main focus at this point, since it has the most amount of complexity. SFZ and EXS24 are far easier formats to support and maintain and the output of these will be made to match the Kontakt instrument once that has been finished. Our prior experience with music instruments, such as the <a href=""https://keypleezer.com/livingroom-upright-piano/free-edition/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">free edition</a> of this upright piano product makes it easier for us to sketch up a timetable and plot out the difficulties and solutions of this more advanced instrument.</p>
<p>Digital downloads will take place through our online eCommerce platform. This solution is a part of our tech-stack already and we have the necessary web-technologies in place to handle demand of instrument downloads, which can be a both expensive and lengthy item to set up, especially for downloadable packages of 20GB size or more.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">OUR USE OF YOUR INVESTMENT</h3>
<p>We´re on a path of no return to make the best possible software product we can. Free of bugs and hick-ups. Your investment makes it a lot easier for us to make that happen in less time and with greater accuracy. Here´s a breakdown of our intended use of funds.<br/> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>30%</strong> of funds: Graphic Design / 3D design rendering &amp; compositing.</li>
<li>
<strong>50%</strong> of funds: Code creation &amp; enhancements of KSP Piano Playback Engine.</li>
<li>
<strong>15%</strong> of funds (or remaining funds): SFZ specific programming or consulting and format conversion tools needed to continuously make updates in all formats to be supported. Also digital delivery solutions and eventual web coding solutions, most of which have been pre-programmed and set-up in advance. </li>
<li>For the Complete Edition Physical USB package, funds received from this tier will be reserved in part for a physical package creation and material costs, as well as USB memory storage devices for physical file delivery.</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>We want to make it clear that these are estimates and that we will use the funds to the components that have the highest priority for the reliability of the software instrument. If one component of the different tasks get done at an earlier date, we will shift funds towards the next or a parallel task.</p>

To accurately model the original piece in the digital realm over 4200 recordings were made in groups ranging from sustained notes to acoustical behavioral sounds and noises and played back through the advanced piano playback engine in the virtual piano.
 
Sustained note recordings - pedal on & off
Nuance and dynamic range through multiple sensitivity layers.
All keys of the piano were sampled/recorded 26 times in different groups. The main group is the sustained notes, the ones you hear while pressing down a key. Two sets of sustains were recorded in their full length, one with the pedal unpressed and another with the pedal pressed. The length and sound character is quite different between these and they play an important role in realistically reproducing any piano. 
3 Close Stereo Microphone positions

The complete set of recordings were made in 3 separate simultaneous stereo microphone positions. The first from the front near the strings (the ""player position""), the second one below the keyboard and the third on the rear of the piano body, where sound is let out through two openings. These positions are all close microphone positions that reflect that part of the piano body's most intimate sound. They differ quite a bit in tonality making the piano very versatile and adjustable and can easily blend into any sound or mix. Using the mixer of the virtual instrument you can adjust all components recorded independently for all three positions.
 
Dynamic Range control
An essential piece of a software piano, as opposed to the physical original, is the ability of adjusting the maximum difference between the strongest recording and the softest for each key. Through the Dynamic Range knob you can adjust this either explosive or seamless volume differences in between the recorded sensitivities, so your result matches your song or performance expectations. After all, the dynamic difference in volume is often compressed away, through a compressor or limiter, which many times make most piano tracks sound worse. This feature gets you quicker to your desired sound, circumventing excessive compression.
(features section continues after audio demos) 

SOUND EXAMPLES MADE WITH THE PRE-BETA PIANO SOFTWARE
 
Demo 1 - Slow piano piece



Slow piano piece, as if composed for Film or TV, alternatively as stand-alone piano music. No effects or dynamic processing applied. This demo includes two examples, one without any acoustical layers, another one with all included. For this sound example the acoustical layers were slightly exaggerated so you can hear the difference.

Composed by Anders Eklöv. Made in Logic Pro with Kontakt 5.6 and LivingRoom Upright Piano Complete Edition, pre-beta.

Acoustical modelling and detail
Releasing the key - String dampening and Key release sounds
Depicting acoustical behavior as the key is released.
When you release the key of a played note (without having pressed the sustain pedal) two things happen in a real piano. The key's mechanical parts give off a release noise and the damper will silence the played note, both of which were captured quite extensively for this product.
The dampening of the strings is an important thing in trying to mimic the sound of an acoustic piano. Depending on how long you hold the note and how hard you strike the key, the sound of your stings being dampened will change very much. A quick note has more of a harsh, explosive sound while a normal, longer note creates a less sharp and smoother dampening sound.
Both staccato (shorter) and normal longer held notes's dampening sounds were captured in multiple time intervals as well as velocity (strength), for a full sonic range. Through the piano playback engine the String Dampening sounds are selected polyphonically and follow both the strength of your playing and the time elapsed since you pressed the key. Tone, timing, AHDSR Envelopes and equalization is then applied for the closest match of the original piano's sound character.
The mechanical Key Release sounds follow the same principles but can also be adjusted to add or subtract from the Dynamic Range setting, which at high settings can make the sounds drop out entirely at soft key strokes.
Via the Release Length slider you can shorten the length of string dampening and mechanical noises, for more explosive or quicker playing styles. Both release sounds can be adjusted in the user interface of the virtual piano, for all three microphone positions.
 
String & Body Resonances
Modelling the original piano's internal acoustics.
The internal acoustics of the piano box/body was recorded using Impulse Response reverb technology, also called Convolution Reverb, which captures a resonance of an acoustical environment. Two separate resonances were captured, the piano box/body's internal reverb as a whole and a separate one recorded very near the strings, capturing the piano strings resonating. These are additions you can use in your own desired portion and can give a very nice addition of more overtones for wider sounds and more resonant sounding machinery, much like the original piano.
When connected to the sustain pedal actions, you will hear the same effect of the piano sound ""swelling"" as when you press the pedal on an actual piano. String Resonance gives you an added sense of the presence of the strings while the Body  Resonance adds more of the acoustics of the box.

Put a lid on it!

While the piano comes with an intimate sound character, the ""Lids/Panels"" (open/semi-open/closed) feature lets you encapsulate the sound for a less bright and sometimes more accurate experience, creating the natural sound of an upright piano with the panels attached, not removed/open as your would record it in most situations. Combined with the Body Resonance feature you can make a very resonant sounding piano and then close the lid on the sound, for that classic ""boxy"" upright sound, while placing your instrument as a whole in the desired environment in your mix.
 
Analog-style User Interfacewith Performance and Mixer View

The performance view will give you all the control over the in-the-box adjustments you will need to adjust the intimacy or grandeur of your sound. Using custom volume adjustment for all sound and effect sources you can adjust the note fade-out / decay time, the string dampening and mechanical key release sounds and how they follow what you play. String and piano body resonances are adjusted for all 3 microphone positions on the main performance view and can either follow the actions of your sustain pedalling, or stay on all the time as an effect. 
ADVANCED PIANO AUDIOPLAYBACK ENGINE
Running it all is our custom coded audio playback engine for accurate reproduction of the piano recordings, currently in pre-beta development. A portion of the piano playback engine features include:

adjustable note decay time
custom realistic polyphonic voice blending and fade-out of repeated notes, for accuracy
Accurate String Dampening & Key Release sounds with time and velocity matrix
Authentic Pedal Behaviour - volume and accent follows your playing style
Impulse Response modelled Body & String Resonances with sustain pedal interaction


__________
 

WHO IS IT FOR?

Pianists, keyboardists, musicians & people learning to play the piano
Music producers, song writers and composers of all kinds
Film composers who need high quality alternative piano sounds
Producers working on records with lots of piano based songs, where diversity is desirable

 
HOW DO I USE IT?
SAMPLER FORMATS & PLATFORMS
As a finished software piano it will run in a sampler software on either Windows or macOS. Linux as well if you have the right tools. The sampler formats that are supported are the Native Instruments Kontakt sampler, SFZ & EXS24. The latter is the format used in Logic Pro X, GarageBand and MainStage and will include smart control patches. SFZ is an open source format that can be used in built-in samplers of many different DAWs, but no matter what music program you have you can always use Sforzando, a free sample player for macOS and Windows. While the entire set of sustained note recordings are available for all formats, the acoustical modelling is only fully realizable in Kontakt as a format, as it requires custom scripting to work properly.
What stuff do I need to be able to play the piano?

a computer, laptop or desktop, running Windows or macOS.
either a music program (DAW) or a sampler software of the supported type.
preferably a digital piano, stage piano , a synthesizer or a midi keyboard with either midi output or midi-over-usb to the computer to be able to play the instrument 'live'.

Backing our project: what´s a 'perk' and what am I getting?
A ""perk"" is an item or a set of items or rewards you will receive when you invest a certain predefined amount. Here on Indiegogo they are the same as a ""Pledge"" on Kickstarter projects. At the top-right you will see the alternatives available (on mobile: at the top, or as ""select a perk"" below).
Note: When a Perk sells out, the perk goes away and another may take it´s place, but the earlier you invest the less you will pay, as price goes up every time a tier sells out. Apart from these ""perks"" a backer can also choose to enter their own desired backing amount of their choice. Any backer who backs the project in between two perks pricing will be awarded all perks that are valued less than or the same as the amount entered. This will be handled manually and be delivered to the Indiegogo registered email upon completion of the project, at product delivery/ fulfillment.
For more questions, read through the FAQ section or message us via support@keypleezer.com.

DEVELOPMENT TIMELINE 

 
 Challenges & Pitfalls
Kontakt Sampler as a format is our main focus at this point, since it has the most amount of complexity. SFZ and EXS24 are far easier formats to support and maintain and the output of these will be made to match the Kontakt instrument once that has been finished. Our prior experience with music instruments, such as the free edition of this upright piano product makes it easier for us to sketch up a timetable and plot out the difficulties and solutions of this more advanced instrument.
Digital downloads will take place through our online eCommerce platform. This solution is a part of our tech-stack already and we have the necessary web-technologies in place to handle demand of instrument downloads, which can be a both expensive and lengthy item to set up, especially for downloadable packages of 20GB size or more.
 
OUR USE OF YOUR INVESTMENT
We´re on a path of no return to make the best possible software product we can. Free of bugs and hick-ups. Your investment makes it a lot easier for us to make that happen in less time and with greater accuracy. Here´s a breakdown of our intended use of funds. 


30% of funds: Graphic Design / 3D design rendering & compositing.

50% of funds: Code creation & enhancements of KSP Piano Playback Engine.

15% of funds (or remaining funds): SFZ specific programming or consulting and format conversion tools needed to continuously make updates in all formats to be supported. Also digital delivery solutions and eventual web coding solutions, most of which have been pre-programmed and set-up in advance. 
For the Complete Edition Physical USB package, funds received from this tier will be reserved in part for a physical package creation and material costs, as well as USB memory storage devices for physical file delivery.

We want to make it clear that these are estimates and that we will use the funds to the components that have the highest priority for the reliability of the software instrument. If one component of the different tasks get done at an earlier date, we will shift funds towards the next or a parallel task.

</h2><p> </p><p>Deutsch, siehe unten, Español, véase más abajo.</p><h2>English</h2><h3>Short Summary</h3><p>For every student-musician, the exercising period without the help of a teacher is by far the largest one. Depending on the learning level, practice takes between 70-95% of the total playing time. This overwhelming period is spent on his/her own.</p><p>However, all pupils invest a lot of growth potential in the exercise period, the progress stays small and stagnant. As a consequence, there is a lack of pleasure and exercise demolitions are not seldom.</p><p>As a solution, a software system is needed, which can transfer the quality of the lesson under the teacher’s control into the practicing period on alone.</p><p>The music software ACCENTO combines frequency, rhythm and timbre recognition techniques accompanied by a didactically built collection of music pieces. The students of all performance levels would be able to use the software, especially at home during the practice hours.</p><p>A musician plays the notes marked on the screen and receives feedback about the correctly or incorrectly played notes after it. In the second step, the program runs the appropriate exercises suggested and selected according to the student's errors to correct and practice them. All exercises are performed at appropriate speeds and small increases in tempo, so that at the end of the correction unit (2nd step) the play is guaranteed to be mastered.</p><p>The instrument educational material is designed by top musicians and consist of well-known and self-composed songs, exercises and etudes. The music pieces are integrated into the didactic learning concept and are coordinated with each other. The different levels of difficulty are combined with the different music styles so that one can choose from many different music sheets of different styles. Thus, the learning path is individually adapted to the needs of a student.</p><p>The quality and the intensity of personal instrumental lessons with a teacher are to be transferred to the exercise period. In this way, the musician has to be optimally looked after, especially during the practicing period - which takes more than 80% of the total playing time.</p><p>It is also very important to hold the body correctly while playing an instrument. Our program will also give feedback to the users according to their body position.</p><p>Two target groups will achieve significant benefits with the use of ACCENTO:</p><p>STUDENTS:</p><ul>
<li>Students will increase learning speed.</li>
<li>Students will have fun with their instruments through permanent learning. The drop-out rate of the students will go down.</li>
<li>Through the interaction with the program and different tempos, a learner will have a constant metric guidance, which will develop an inner metric.</li>
<li>The musicians will learn and practice only the correct and necessary skills and won’t consolidate the wrong habits.</li>
</ul><p>Students / parents will save time and money in the long term!</p><p>TEACHERS:</p><ul>
<li>Teachers will teach more successfully.</li>
<li> A student will develop an exercise discipline, which is designed by the trained instrument specialists.</li>
<li>He/she will be better prepared for the lesson, will not make unnecessary exercising and mistakes, which will simplify weekly exercises, since it will be possible to work on the music problems instead on the constant correction of the learnt habits.</li>
<li>Teachers' reputation will be enhanced by the successes of their students.</li>
</ul><p>We are going to start with the following instruments: piano, guitar, flute and violin</p><p>The software is open, each user will be able to use his/her own music material.</p><p>Website: <a href=""http://www.bacco.co.at/es"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.bacco.co.at/en</a></p><h3>What you give us &amp; what you get</h3><p>The development of the software is going to be largely financed through the support of the Austrian Research Promotion Agency. We will still need additional capital, since the funding does not cover 100% of the costs. With your help, we will be able to fully cover the development costs as well as to ensure the market transition of the product.</p><p>The total cost for the first year is € 250000. The additional funds of the campaign will be invested in additional hardware, personnel costs, rent, as well as other incidental costs.</p><p>You will receive the product in different combinations (see Perks) for a reduced price.</p><p>The software will run on iOS, OSX, Android, Windows and Linux (Ubuntu and Fedora, other Distros on request) and it will run on PCs, tablets or mobile phones, in English, German, Spanish, Chinese and Korean (other languages on request).</p><p>For more than 100 prospective customers we will offer ACCENTO in other language ​​as well as other Linux distribution.</p><p>Android is supported since version 5.0.</p><h3>Perks:</h3><ul>

</ul><h2>Deutsch</h2><h3>Kurzbeschreibung</h3><p>Für jeden Musiker stellt die Übungszeit ohne Lehrer den weitaus größten Musizierzeitraum dar. Je nach Niveau nimmt die Übungszeit zwischen 70-95% der gesamten Spielzeit ein. Diese weitaus überwiegende Zeit verbringt der Musiker ohne seinen Lehrer, er/sie ist auf sich allein gestellt.</p><p>Allerdings verschenken Schüler in der Übungszeit sehr viel Entwicklungspotenzial, wodurch der Fortschritt kleiner ist, oder stagniert. Die Folge ist mangelnde Lust und nicht selten der Abbruch.</p><p>Als Lösung ist ein System notwendig, welches die Qualität des Unterrichts in die Übungszeit überträgt.</p><p>Die Musiksoftware ACCENTO kombiniert Frequenz,  Rhythmus und Klangfarbe-Erkennungs-Technik begleitet mit einem umfassend didaktisch aufgebauten System von Musikstücken. Musikschüler aller Leistungsstufen sollen die Software vor allem zu Hause in den Übungsstunden verwenden.<br/>Der Musiker spielt die am Bildschirm/Display markierten Noten (Spielaufgabe) und erhält nach dem Spiel eine Rückmeldung über richtig und falsch gespielte Noten. Im zweiten Schritt durchläuft das Programm mit dem Schüler passende Übungen – vorgeschlagen vom Programm und je nach Fehlerstellen des Schülers vom Programm ausgewählt - um die gespielten Fehler zu korrigieren. Sämtliche Übungen erfolgen in passenden Spielgeschwindigkeiten und kleinen Temposteigerungen, sodass am Ende der Korrektureinheit (2. Schritt) die Spielaufgabe garantiert bewältigt wird.</p><p> Das Notenmaterial wird von Spitzenmusikern konzipiert und besteht aus bekannten und selbst komponierten Liedern, Übungen, Etüden. Die Musikstücke sind in ein didaktisches Lernkonzept eingebunden und aufeinander abgestimmt. Verschiedene Schwierigkeitsgrade werden mit verschiedenen Musikstilen kombiniert, sodass auf jedem Niveau viele Musikstücke unterschiedlichster Art gewählt werden können. Somit wird der Lernweg individuell den Bedürfnissen des Schülers angepasst.</p><p>Die Qualität und Intensität des persönlichen Instrumentalunterrichts mit dem Lehrer soll auf die Übungszeit übertragen werden. Damit soll der Musiker vor allem in der Übungszeit - welche den weitaus größten Teil der gesamten Spielzeit ausmacht - optimal betreut werden.</p><p>Auch die Körperhaltung beim Spielen eines Instrumentes ist sehr wichtig, unser Programm wird auch ein Feedback  diesbezüglich den Benutzern geben</p><p>Zwei Zielgruppen erzielen mit der Verwendung von ACCENTO einen erheblichen Nutzen:</p><p>SCHÜLER:</p><ul>
<li>Der Schüler steigert die Lerngeschwindigkeit.</li>
<li>Die Schüler haben durch dauerhafte Lernerfolge Spaß mit ihrem Instrument. Die Abbruchsquote der Schüler sinkt.</li>
<li>Die Schüler/Eltern sparen langfristig Zeit und Geld!</li>
<li>Durch die Interaktion mit dem Programm und den verschiedenen Tempos hat der Lernende eine konstante metrische Führung, wodurch dieser eine innere Metrik entwickeln kann.</li>
<li>Man lernt /übt nur die richtigen Fertigkeiten und man festigt nicht falsche Angewohnheiten.  </li>
</ul><p>LEHRER:</p><ul>
<li>Die Lehrer unterrichten erfolgreicher.</li>
<li>Die Reputation der Lehrer wird durch die Erfolge seiner Schüler gesteigert.</li>
<li>Der Schüler wird eine Übungsdisziplin entwickeln, welche speziell ausgebildeten Fachkräfte gestalten</li>
<li>Der Schüler kommt besser vorbereitet zur Stunde, macht weniger unnötige Fehler, was die wöchentliche Arbeit vereinfachen wird, da es möglich sein wird an den musikalischen Problemen zu arbeiten anstatt falsch gelernte Abläufe andauernd korrigieren zu müssen.</li>

</ul><h2>Español</h2><h3>Descripción</h3><p>La práctica de un instrumento sin la compañía de un docente representa para cada músico el periodo más prolongado de la práctica musical. De acuerdo al nivel del instrumentista, la práctica individual representa entre el 70 y el 95% del tiempo total de ejecución. Durante todo ese tiempo cada músico ejercita su instrumento sin la presencia de su maestro, el/ella depende solo de si mismo.</p><p>No obstante la mayor parte de los estudiantes de música desperdicia una gran cantidad de potencial durante la práctica diaria, la evolución es mínima o en su defecto se produce un estancamiento. El resultado es insuficiente motivación y con mucha frecuencia el abandono de la práctica musical.</p><p>Como solución es necesario crear un sistema que traslade la calidad de las clases a la práctica diaria.</p><p>El Software ACCENTO combina el reconocimiento de la frecuencia, el ritmo y el timbre siendo acompañado por un sistema pedagógico de obras progresivas. Los estudiantes de todas las edades y niveles usarán el Software sobre todo en sus hogares durante la práctica de sus respectivos instrumentos. Los músicos tocarán las piezas mostradas en la pantalla de sus dispositivos, y una vez finalizada la ejecución tendrán la oportunidad de visualizar los errores realizados. A continuación el programa le sugerirá al usuario ejercicios técnicos para corregir los errores cometidos. Los ejercicios serán ejecutados con una aceleración gradual del Tempo, para garantizar de esta manera la culminación exitosa de la pieza correspondiente.</p><p>Las piezas de los métodos serán concebidas por renombrados pedagogos comprendiendo las obras más importantes de la literatura de cada instrumento, así como arreglos propios. Diferentes estilos y niveles de dificultad serán combinados de manera que en cada nivel sea posible escoger diferentes piezas, posibilitando de esta manera la elección de un recorrido individual que se adapte a las exigencias o problemas de cada alumno.</p><p>De esta forma la calidad e intensidad de las clases instrumentales serán trasladadas a la práctica diaria. Así será posible aprovecharla al máximo y acelerar considerablemente el aprendizaje musical.</p><p>La postura es también muy importante al tocar un instrumento. Nuestro programa también ofrecerá un  control sobre posibles errores de postura durante la ejecución.</p><p>Dos grupos de usuarios percibirán con el uso de ACCENTO enormes beneficios:</p><p>ESTUDIANTES</p><ul>
<li>El estudiante podrá aprender con más rapidez     </li>
<li>A través de su mejoría le será posible disfrutar la actividad musical.</li>

 Deutsch, siehe unten, Español, véase más abajo.EnglishShort SummaryFor every student-musician, the exercising period without the help of a teacher is by far the largest one. Depending on the learning level, practice takes between 70-95% of the total playing time. This overwhelming period is spent on his/her own.However, all pupils invest a lot of growth potential in the exercise period, the progress stays small and stagnant. As a consequence, there is a lack of pleasure and exercise demolitions are not seldom.As a solution, a software system is needed, which can transfer the quality of the lesson under the teacher’s control into the practicing period on alone.The music software ACCENTO combines frequency, rhythm and timbre recognition techniques accompanied by a didactically built collection of music pieces. The students of all performance levels would be able to use the software, especially at home during the practice hours.A musician plays the notes marked on the screen and receives feedback about the correctly or incorrectly played notes after it. In the second step, the program runs the appropriate exercises suggested and selected according to the student's errors to correct and practice them. All exercises are performed at appropriate speeds and small increases in tempo, so that at the end of the correction unit (2nd step) the play is guaranteed to be mastered.The instrument educational material is designed by top musicians and consist of well-known and self-composed songs, exercises and etudes. The music pieces are integrated into the didactic learning concept and are coordinated with each other. The different levels of difficulty are combined with the different music styles so that one can choose from many different music sheets of different styles. Thus, the learning path is individually adapted to the needs of a student.The quality and the intensity of personal instrumental lessons with a teacher are to be transferred to the exercise period. In this way, the musician has to be optimally looked after, especially during the practicing period - which takes more than 80% of the total playing time.It is also very important to hold the body correctly while playing an instrument. Our program will also give feedback to the users according to their body position.Two target groups will achieve significant benefits with the use of ACCENTO:STUDENTS:
Students will increase learning speed.
Students will have fun with their instruments through permanent learning. The drop-out rate of the students will go down.
Through the interaction with the program and different tempos, a learner will have a constant metric guidance, which will develop an inner metric.
The musicians will learn and practice only the correct and necessary skills and won’t consolidate the wrong habits.
Students / parents will save time and money in the long term!TEACHERS:
Teachers will teach more successfully.
 A student will develop an exercise discipline, which is designed by the trained instrument specialists.
He/she will be better prepared for the lesson, will not make unnecessary exercising and mistakes, which will simplify weekly exercises, since it will be possible to work on the music problems instead on the constant correction of the learnt habits.
Teachers' reputation will be enhanced by the successes of their students.
We are going to start with the following instruments: piano, guitar, flute and violinThe software is open, each user will be able to use his/her own music material.Website: www.bacco.co.at/enWhat you give us & what you getThe development of the software is going to be largely financed through the support of the Austrian Research Promotion Agency.

DeutschKurzbeschreibungFür jeden Musiker stellt die Übungszeit ohne Lehrer den weitaus größten Musizierzeitraum dar. Je nach Niveau nimmt die Übungszeit zwischen 70-95% der gesamten Spielzeit ein. Diese weitaus überwiegende Zeit verbringt der Musiker ohne seinen Lehrer, er/sie ist auf sich allein gestellt.Allerdings verschenken Schüler in der Übungszeit sehr viel Entwicklungspotenzial, wodurch der Fortschritt kleiner ist, oder stagniert. Die Folge ist mangelnde Lust und nicht selten der Abbruch.Als Lösung ist ein System notwendig, welches die Qualität des Unterrichts in die Übungszeit überträgt.Die Musiksoftware ACCENTO kombiniert Frequenz,  Rhythmus und Klangfarbe-Erkennungs-Technik begleitet mit einem umfassend didaktisch aufgebauten System von Musikstücken. Musikschüler aller Leistungsstufen sollen die Software vor allem zu Hause in den Übungsstunden verwenden.Der Musiker spielt die am Bildschirm/Display markierten Noten (Spielaufgabe) und erhält nach dem Spiel eine Rückmeldung über richtig und falsch gespielte Noten. Im zweiten Schritt durchläuft das Programm mit dem Schüler passende Übungen – vorgeschlagen vom Programm und je nach Fehlerstellen des Schülers vom Programm ausgewählt - um die gespielten Fehler zu korrigieren. Sämtliche Übungen erfolgen in passenden Spielgeschwindigkeiten und kleinen Temposteigerungen, sodass am Ende der Korrektureinheit (2. Schritt) die Spielaufgabe garantiert bewältigt wird. Das Notenmaterial wird von Spitzenmusikern konzipiert und besteht aus bekannten und selbst komponierten Liedern, Übungen, Etüden. Die Musikstücke sind in ein didaktisches Lernkonzept eingebunden und aufeinander abgestimmt. Verschiedene Schwierigkeitsgrade werden mit verschiedenen Musikstilen kombiniert, sodass auf jedem Niveau viele Musikstücke unterschiedlichster Art gewählt werden können. Somit wird der Lernweg individuell den Bedürfnissen des Schülers angepasst.Die Qualität und Intensität des persönlichen Instrumentalunterrichts mit dem Lehrer soll auf die Übungszeit übertragen werden. Damit soll der Musiker vor allem in der Übungszeit - welche den weitaus größten Teil der gesamten Spielzeit ausmacht - optimal betreut werden.Auch die Körperhaltung beim Spielen eines Instrumentes ist sehr wichtig, unser Programm wird auch ein Feedback  diesbezüglich den Benutzern gebenZwei Zielgruppen erzielen mit der Verwendung von ACCENTO einen erheblichen Nutzen:SCHÜLER:
Der Schüler steigert die Lerngeschwindigkeit.
Die Schüler haben durch dauerhafte Lernerfolge Spaß mit ihrem Instrument. Die Abbruchsquote der Schüler sinkt.
Die Schüler/Eltern sparen langfristig Zeit und Geld!
Durch die Interaktion mit dem Programm und den verschiedenen Tempos hat der Lernende eine konstante metrische Führung, wodurch dieser eine innere Metrik entwickeln kann.
Man lernt /übt nur die richtigen Fertigkeiten und man festigt nicht falsche Angewohnheiten.  
LEHRER:
Die Lehrer unterrichten erfolgreicher.
Die Reputation der Lehrer wird durch die Erfolge seiner Schüler gesteigert.
Der Schüler wird eine Übungsdisziplin entwickeln, welche speziell ausgebildeten Fachkräfte gestalten
Der Schüler kommt besser vorbereitet zur Stunde, macht weniger unnötige Fehler, was die wöchentliche Arbeit vereinfachen wird, da es möglich sein wird an den musikalischen Problemen zu arbeiten anstatt falsch gelernte Abläufe andauernd korrigieren zu müssen.
Wir beginnen mit folgenden Instrumenten: Klavier, Gitarre, Querflöte und ViolineDie Software ist offen, jeder Benutzer wird in der Lage sein sein eigenes Notenmaterial zu verwenden.Was du uns gibst & was du bekommstDie Entwicklung der Software wird sich großteils über eine Förderung der Österreichischen Forschungsförderungsgesellschaft finanzieren.Da die Förderung nicht 100% der Kosten abdeckt, benötigen wir weiterhin zusätzliches Kapital. Mit eurer Hilfe werden wir die Entwicklungskosten vollständig abdecken können, sowie auch den Marktübergang des Produktes absichern.Die Gesamtkosten für das erste Jahr betragen €250000. Die zusätzliche Mittel der Kampagne werden in zusätzliche Hardware, Personalkosten, Miete, sowie weitere Nebenkosten investiert.Ihr bekommt als Belohnung das Produkt in verschiedenen Kombinationen (siehe Perks)  gegen einen ermäßigten Preis.Die Software wird für iOS, OSX, Android, Windows und Linux - (Ubuntu und Fedora, andere Distros nach Anfrage) -und es wird auf Computer, Tablets oder Handys laufen, vorerst auf Englisch, Deutsch, Spanisch, Chinesisch und Koreanisch (andere Sprachen nach Anfrage).Bei mindestens 100 Interessenten können wir  in anderen Sprachen sowie andere Linux Distributionen anbieten.Android wird ab Version 5.0 unterstützt.Perks:

EspañolDescripciónLa práctica de un instrumento sin la compañía de un docente representa para cada músico el periodo más prolongado de la práctica musical. De acuerdo al nivel del instrumentista, la práctica individual representa entre el 70 y el 95% del tiempo total de ejecución. Durante todo ese tiempo cada músico ejercita su instrumento sin la presencia de su maestro, el/ella depende solo de si mismo.No obstante la mayor parte de los estudiantes de música desperdicia una gran cantidad de potencial durante la práctica diaria, la evolución es mínima o en su defecto se produce un estancamiento. El resultado es insuficiente motivación y con mucha frecuencia el abandono de la práctica musical.Como solución es necesario crear un sistema que traslade la calidad de las clases a la práctica diaria.El Software ACCENTO combina el reconocimiento de la frecuencia, el ritmo y el timbre siendo acompañado por un sistema pedagógico de obras progresivas. Los estudiantes de todas las edades y niveles usarán el Software sobre todo en sus hogares durante la práctica de sus respectivos instrumentos. Los músicos tocarán las piezas mostradas en la pantalla de sus dispositivos, y una vez finalizada la ejecución tendrán la oportunidad de visualizar los errores realizados. A continuación el programa le sugerirá al usuario ejercicios técnicos para corregir los errores cometidos. Los ejercicios serán ejecutados con una aceleración gradual del Tempo, para garantizar de esta manera la culminación exitosa de la pieza correspondiente.Las piezas de los métodos serán concebidas por renombrados pedagogos comprendiendo las obras más importantes de la literatura de cada instrumento, así como arreglos propios. Diferentes estilos y niveles de dificultad serán combinados de manera que en cada nivel sea posible escoger diferentes piezas, posibilitando de esta manera la elección de un recorrido individual que se adapte a las exigencias o problemas de cada alumno.De esta forma la calidad e intensidad de las clases instrumentales serán trasladadas a la práctica diaria. Así será posible aprovecharla al máximo y acelerar considerablemente el aprendizaje musical.La postura es también muy importante al tocar un instrumento. Nuestro programa también ofrecerá un  control sobre posibles errores de postura durante la ejecución.Dos grupos de usuarios percibirán con el uso de ACCENTO enormes beneficios:ESTUDIANTES
El estudiante podrá aprender con más rapidez     
A través de su mejoría le será posible disfrutar la actividad musical.
Los estudiantes / padres ahorrarán tiempo y dinero.
Desarrolla el pulso interno, ya que al interactuar con el programa y los diferentes metros el estudiante tendrá una guía métrica constante.
Habrá una supervisión constante del estudio diario, con lo cual será posible ahorrar el tiempo que se pierde cuando se aprende algo mal. Solo se aprenden lecciones positivas, de esta manera el aprendizaje no se construye en base a la corrección de malos hábitos.

<p style=""text-align: right;"">Hello everyone ...</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">My name is Marsio Salcuni, and I am a lover of <strong>Music, Physics and Magnetism, and one day, I got the idea of ​​combining these three things in my own way!</strong> And I must admit that it didn't go badly ... That idea gave me the opportunity to build my first <strong>X-PICK</strong>, and start having fun experimenting and playing. As you can see from the videos, however, I started to understand that it was much more important than just having fun ... I discovered that it <strong>is a set of everything a guitarist or bassist should have always with him</strong> ... All enclosed in a little Gem!</p>
<p>Like a ... <strong>MultiFunction Army Knife</strong> ... made especially for Musicians, <strong>which combines a multitude of objects, which usually a guitarist buys and uses separately</strong> ... In addition to the fact that it gives us the possibility <strong>to do many things that could not be done in any other way, if not with the X-Pick </strong>... Like <strong>Playing with Magnetic Fields</strong>!</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><strong>I can not wait to see the thousand other facets that All of You are able to discover, </strong>moreover because each of you has different instruments, amplifiers, settings ... and being Magnetic Fields, they will always be different, with different results, different sounds, etc ...</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><strong>Each of you will contribute to the growth of the X-Pick's capabilities, and yours! </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><strong>Because you will have 1000 more ways to MAKE MUSIC! </strong></p>
<div>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607957886/tovocyvj431mkquzmij5.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">The X-PICK has a size of <strong>24 mm x 25 mm, </strong>a thickness of<strong> 4 mm</strong> and has a <strong>well-defined tip, but with a very wide angle (90° in Axial Position)</strong>, such as to facilitate simple picking or normal fast picking.</p>
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The <strong>DESIGN</strong>, combined with the type of <strong>MAGNETIZATION</strong>, never creates problems of too much attraction towards the strings ... The maximum magnetic degree, is poured only on the faces of the magnet as Physics teaches us, and strong enough, but calculated, on the back of the X-Pick to use magnetic field modulation techniques! ... It is obvious, for example, that the bass strings suffer more attraction, given their thickness, but this in no way prevents the fast and precise picking, as you have seen from the videos because you can take advantage also of a <strong>Magnetic Trick</strong>, to improve Normal Picking and Fast Picking: <strong>""Exactly at the tip</strong>, at the union between the <strong>North</strong> and <strong>South</strong> magnetic fields, <strong>there is no attraction with the iron strings</strong>, but an imperceptible, but decisive repulsive force is felt, which facilitates the Picking, as if the string were thrown"".</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">The reason is that the iron atoms of the string, being close to both polarities almost simultaneously (i.e. picking) do not have time to reorient themselves for the attraction, and combined with the fact that the power of magnetism always focuses on the faces of a magnet, I opted for axial magnetization that collides the opposite magnetic fields, right in the tip, and I created this kind of magnetism game to facilitate and speed up the movement of the pick ...</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>The rear corners are cut</strong> in order to facilitate the use of some particular techniques, <strong>and ensure the right degree of magnetism in the interaction between magnetic fields with the Pickups.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It has very smooth lateral surfaces to slide on the strings like a slide</strong> would and the back is the one that has the most magnetic degree, because it is the widest, suitable for all the innovative techniques that require magnetic field modulations of the pick-ups of the instruments</p>

<p>In addition to the one shown above, and that you could see from the videos, you must keep in mind that <strong>the combinations of use of the X-Pick are infinite</strong> ... I am talking about the all different instruments we have, and therefore with different magnetic fields, completely new results , or used together with different pedals, amplifiers of various brands and powers, and I could go on forever as you well know… <strong>SO IT'S A NEW WORLD TO BE COMPLETELY DISCOVERED BY EACH OF YOU !!!</strong></p>

</div></div>","Hello everyone ...
My name is Marsio Salcuni, and I am a lover of Music, Physics and Magnetism, and one day, I got the idea of ​​combining these three things in my own way! And I must admit that it didn't go badly ... That idea gave me the opportunity to build my first X-PICK, and start having fun experimenting and playing. As you can see from the videos, however, I started to understand that it was much more important than just having fun ... I discovered that it is a set of everything a guitarist or bassist should have always with him ... All enclosed in a little Gem!
Like a ... MultiFunction Army Knife ... made especially for Musicians, which combines a multitude of objects, which usually a guitarist buys and uses separately ... In addition to the fact that it gives us the possibility to do many things that could not be done in any other way, if not with the X-Pick ... Like Playing with Magnetic Fields!
I can not wait to see the thousand other facets that All of You are able to discover, moreover because each of you has different instruments, amplifiers, settings ... and being Magnetic Fields, they will always be different, with different results, different sounds, etc ...
Each of you will contribute to the growth of the X-Pick's capabilities, and yours! 
Because you will have 1000 more ways to MAKE MUSIC! 


The X-PICK has a size of 24 mm x 25 mm, a thickness of 4 mm and has a well-defined tip, but with a very wide angle (90° in Axial Position), such as to facilitate simple picking or normal fast picking.

The DESIGN, combined with the type of MAGNETIZATION, never creates problems of too much attraction towards the strings ... The maximum magnetic degree, is poured only on the faces of the magnet as Physics teaches us, and strong enough, but calculated, on the back of the X-Pick to use magnetic field modulation techniques! ... It is obvious, for example, that the bass strings suffer more attraction, given their thickness, but this in no way prevents the fast and precise picking, as you have seen from the videos because you can take advantage also of a Magnetic Trick, to improve Normal Picking and Fast Picking: ""Exactly at the tip, at the union between the North and South magnetic fields, there is no attraction with the iron strings, but an imperceptible, but decisive repulsive force is felt, which facilitates the Picking, as if the string were thrown"".
The reason is that the iron atoms of the string, being close to both polarities almost simultaneously (i.e. picking) do not have time to reorient themselves for the attraction, and combined with the fact that the power of magnetism always focuses on the faces of a magnet, I opted for axial magnetization that collides the opposite magnetic fields, right in the tip, and I created this kind of magnetism game to facilitate and speed up the movement of the pick ...
The rear corners are cut in order to facilitate the use of some particular techniques, and ensure the right degree of magnetism in the interaction between magnetic fields with the Pickups.
It has very smooth lateral surfaces to slide on the strings like a slide would and the back is the one that has the most magnetic degree, because it is the widest, suitable for all the innovative techniques that require magnetic field modulations of the pick-ups of the instruments


 


The direction of magnetization of the pick is AXIAL, in such a way as to adapt to any type of polarity of the pick ups on the market.
The X-Pick is made with material named NEODYMIUM, from the category of Rare Earth Permanent Magnets; is chemically composed with NdFeB (Neodymium-Iron-Boron) and has the highest degree of magnetism that exists: N52. 
It have a Coating named (Ni-Cu-Ni- Epoxy) that is, a Nickel-Copper-Nickel composition and a final layer of Epoxy Resin to give more grip in contact with the fingers, as well as for protection from wear …
 
MAGNETIC FIELDS (with iron powder):


  


""X- PICK""
ALL IN NEODYMIUM N52
THE ONLY MAGNETIC PICK OF ALL TIMES
+
ROUND PLASTIC CASE
TO PROTECT THE X-PICK AND
ALWAYS CARRY IT WITH YOU !!
 



""X- PICK""
ALL IN NEODYMIUM N52
THE ONLY MAGNETIC PICK OF ALL TIMES
+
WOODEN DISPLAY BOX
​TO SHOW IT IN ALL ITS SPLENDOR: 
- AT YOUR HOME, 
- WHERE YOU PLAY WITH YOUR BAND, 
- IN THE SHOWCASE OF YOUR SHOP, 
- OR FOR A PHANTASMAGORIC
 GIFT TO GIVE TO A MUSICIAN !!
 
 
 
IT IS COMPOSED BY:
 
- A WOODEN DIPLAY BOX
- VELVET BEARING
- NON-SLIP MAGNET
WHICH ALLOWS THE X-PICK TO REMAIN
ERECTED FOR EXPOSURE, IN FRONT OF
THE LOGO THAT IS ALSO PRESENT INSIDE ... 
+
    
AND IN ADDITION WITH THE CHOICE ""EXPO"" 
YOU WILL ALSO HAVE THE ""TACTICAL"" CASE
TO PROTECT THE X-PICK AND TAKE IT WITH YOU
 


 


Describing what happens, when it bring the X-Pick closer and away from the pick up of the instrument, there is a field modulation of the electromagnetic coils, with consequent change of shape, direction and intensity of the magnetic field between the X-Pick and the pick ups, to produce a different sound than usual ...
Using the X-Pick, you can change, IN REAL TIME: THE POSITION, THE SHAPE, THE POWER, THE INTENSITY of the GUITAR/BASS PICKUPS, which will have their fixed magnetic field, modulated by a magnetic brother who moves on them!
AS IF YOU CREATED A DIFFERENT PICKUP FOR EVERY PICK POSITION, ADAPTABLE TO EVERY KIND OF NEED:
 
 
PLECTRUM
New approach in the use of the Pick, with the use of the Magnetic Trick explained above, to improve control and speed up the Pick

​

 
BODY & CRISTALLINITY OF SOUND
Crystallinity and Body of Sound thanks to this innovative material, the Neodymium, which makes it seem to ALWAYS PLAY WITH NEW STRINGS!

 
SLIDE
A Wonderfull Slide, again thanks to Neodymium, which guarantees a Great Sustain! But also under another aspect: Finally you will use the Slide with the right hand in an agile way, leaving the left free to put chords, managing to act even only on the single note !!

 
PICK – TAPPING or ""TAPPICK""
The Pick that will allow you to give a brilliant and perfect note just to contact, without having to press the string on the fret like a Viking, like with normal picks! In fact, it makes the notes shine even where there is no guitar fretboard, so much that you will use it for magnificent and wild tapping, where no one has gone before!

 
BRUSHES EFFECT
Sound produced only by the magnetic fields, bringing the pick closer to the Pick Up, and making them pass the strings, one by one or all together to create the rolls

 
MAGNETIC FIELDS DELAY
Delay of any kind of sound you want; Just one touch on the note or chords, like the classic pedalboards, and then you have Total Control over the Delay ... You'll be able to slow down or speed up the delay, accentuate it, change the sound in real time ... 

 
ELECTRIC VIOLIN & OCTAVER
(POWER & ETERNAL SUSTAIN)
ELECTRIC VIOLIN: Only sliding on the string gently, with the back or side of the X-Pick; HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU HOPED THAT YOUR BENDING WILL LAST IN ETERNAL GARY MOORE STYLE ???? ... NOW YOU CAN DO IT TOO !!! ALSO RECOMMENDED FOR LESS EXPENSIVE AND PERFORMING GUITARS !!
OCTAVER: Just slipping on the string with the back of the pick, adds more than an octave to the traditional guitar fretboard with a bright and powerful sound!

 
HYPER PICKING
THE TECHNIQUE BORN WITH THE X-PICK, that will allow you to play without touching the strings, and to interact only through magnetic fields! In this case the change in polarity of the magnetic field acts (Attraction/Repulsion), because the movement of the pick is right - left with respect to the string ...

 
MAGNETIC FIELDS TREMOLO
OTHER X-PICK TECHNIQUE, which differs from Hyper Picking, because the movement of the Pick with respect to the strings is up and down, that is, close to and away from the string quickly. In this case there is Compression of Magnetic Fields (Only Repulsion) TECHNIQUE THAT FINALLY WILL MAKES TREMOLO POSSIBLE EVEN ON LEVER-LESS GUITARS!

 
REVERSE / ROTARY
Technique that thanks to the magnetic fields, will gives us the possibility of having these effects even without a pedal board ... How many times have you brought the effects pedals to an evening of the band, to use them in a single song?

 
EPIC ATTACK: ""THE GOD OF ROCK"" 
Versatile and Innovative Pick Attack thanks to Neodymium, and speaking personally, it is one of the most exciting things this little treasure will makes with your support!

 
ULTRA MAGNETIC CONVENIENCE
You will be able to magnetically attach your X-Pick wherever you want thanks to the high magnetic degree: to an iron necklace, a bracelet, a belt, a ring, near any small iron part or small part of the same guitar as I did in the video, and speed up your changes from accompaniment to solo! 

 
MANY EFFECTS
In addition to the one shown above, and that you could see from the videos, you must keep in mind that the combinations of use of the X-Pick are infinite ... I am talking about the all different instruments we have, and therefore with different magnetic fields, completely new results , or used together with different pedals, amplifiers of various brands and powers, and I could go on forever as you well know… SO IT'S A NEW WORLD TO BE COMPLETELY DISCOVERED BY EACH OF YOU !!!

 
HANG OBJECTS
Hang a sheet on the refrigerator, Hang a screwdriver or hammer, Hang up the cell phone, ...

 
LEARN SCIENCE
With a Magnet so strong, it will be easier to learn the rules of magnetism at school, at home, anywhere ...

 
MAGNETIZE OBJECTS
Such as Screwdrivers, screws, Knives, paper clips, etc ...



On Technical Level
When you'll playing with the X-Pick, you will not hear those annoying hums due to too high gain or too open tones or exaggerated volumes ... This happens because the X-Pick, being made of ferrous material and magnetic, in contact with the strings, IMPROVE THE GROUNDING SYSTEM OF THE INSTRUMENT, closing better the mass that makes the usual turn in your body only from the left hand; a round of Grounding that is usually stopped by the normal picks of non-conducting material ...

On Philosophical Level
And for this I have to go a little personal ... Well, I'm one of those who sweated with work and the few savings his Gibson Les Paul Studio, and this desire to have it, created a bond ... let's say I'm one of those who believe that every instrument has a SOUL, a CONSCIENCE, and an OPINION to express… And when I play, I speak to her! SHE TALK TO ME! ...
So why not give maximum voice to this essence?

LET YOUR GUITAR OR BASS EXPRESS, IN NEW WAYS, WITH SOUNDS THAT HAVE NEVER HEARD OR PRODUCED, WITH NEW TECHNIQUES ... NEW VIBRATIONS !! ...

<p>We at Folktek have been around for years, creating unique synthesizers and audio works.</p>
<p>Please follow us on instagram <strong>@folktek</strong> for updates and see our other work there and on folktek.com</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The widely loved and highly regarded effects of Alters 1(X) and 2(Y) were originally in eurorack format but we've decided to extend the processing to both guitar pedal players and studio musicians. </p>
<p>There are two different pedals, each with the same design but with 7 effects unique to each.</p>
<p>There are two versions of the pedal which are physically identical except the name ""Alter X"" and ""Alter Y"". Internally each has an entirely different set of 7 DSP effects meticulously designed over the course of a year by Arius Blaze (Folktek) with digital programming by Nico Raftis (Macro Machines).</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1611799839/pdzcogtjpudfzuuc3x1a.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>For the guitar player, Alter has relay-based buffered bypass with true stereo 1/4"" ins and outs. Also utilize the CV (control voltage) over the effects controls with a CV source and/or a CV expression pedal such as the Moog EP-3 expression pedal.</p>
<p>For the synth player who wants a desktop effects unit, use the 1/8"" or 1/4"" ins and outs and utilize the CV over all main effects controls.</p>

<br/><br/><strong>Goals and offerings</strong>
</h3>
<p>Our goal is simple: to put things out in the world that physically reflect the beauty of the internal design. By preordering you're helping us to do that because production can be rather costly. We're keeping our campaign simple: order either pedal X, Y or both. Each pedal will include a power supply and orders of both pedals will also receive a power splitter.</p>
<p>For dealers, you're welcome to preorder the Alters for your shop rather than wait for an entirely new run. The dealer price is reflective of our wholesale pricing when ordering 10 or more pedals.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>How you can help</strong></h3>
<p>Please get the word out. The more successful we are with this campaign the more easily we can reach our goal by fully devoting ourselves to the project.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Shipping and Payment</strong></h3>
<p>We've already perfected the Alter circuit as we've been putting them out for years as eurorack modules and embedded in instruments called Resonant Gardens and Nano Gardens. We've gone through multiple prototypes and finalized our design of the guitar elements. We've teamed up with a manufacturer we're confident in and believe we'll have no problem reaching our ship date. That said, a ship date is only an estimation - we actually expect to be able to ship them far in advance of our ship date. We put our estimate on this quite a ways back and our goal is to fulfill our orders before the date provided, leaving ourselves, our parts suppliers and our circuit manufacturer  leeway. We've had other crowdfunding campaigns and have learned plenty from our mistakes and embraced our successes.</p>
</div></div>","Alter X and Y
guitar pedals and desktop processors
We at Folktek have been around for years, creating unique synthesizers and audio works.
Please follow us on instagram @folktek for updates and see our other work there and on folktek.com
 
The widely loved and highly regarded effects of Alters 1(X) and 2(Y) were originally in eurorack format but we've decided to extend the processing to both guitar pedal players and studio musicians. 
There are two different pedals, each with the same design but with 7 effects unique to each.
There are two versions of the pedal which are physically identical except the name ""Alter X"" and ""Alter Y"". Internally each has an entirely different set of 7 DSP effects meticulously designed over the course of a year by Arius Blaze (Folktek) with digital programming by Nico Raftis (Macro Machines).

 
For the guitar player, Alter has relay-based buffered bypass with true stereo 1/4"" ins and outs. Also utilize the CV (control voltage) over the effects controls with a CV source and/or a CV expression pedal such as the Moog EP-3 expression pedal.
For the synth player who wants a desktop effects unit, use the 1/8"" or 1/4"" ins and outs and utilize the CV over all main effects controls.
 
 

CONTROL common with both Alter X and Y
 
Buffered relay-based bypass over 1/4"" inputs.
-
Controls for mix, X, Y and filter as well as clock bitrate.

All effects have a variation of a filter which may change effect to effect.


Touch-based effect change by touching the gold hexagon. Effects indicated by lighted control panel.
X and Y control various rates, feedback and time over the different effects.
Clock control adjusts the rate which controls the DSP which can drastically change the effect. In doing so it does slightly lower the quality of the output signal but the results are fantastic. This clock is not for synchronization.
Mix, X, Y and filter all have CV control inputs.
Trails on the guitar side. 
Each control level or cv input is visualized on the control panel.
Powered with included 12v negative tip supply.
Dimensions: 6"" x 5"" x 1 3/8""

 
X Pedal Effects:

long delay
tight, notated granular delay
huge plate reverb
shimmering reverb
distortion and multi-filter
pitch delay
stutter glitch

 
Y Pedal Effects

analog delay
reverb with infinite capture and lp + hp filters 
choral reverb
palindrome reverse delay - backward/forward repeat
time stretch
pitch shift (notated semi-tones
time stretch glitch

 
Explorations
We've teamed up with some of our favorite artists, allowing them free reign to use the pedals as they like and they've made us an array of fantastic videos  for you to get a sampling of effects, sounds and possibilities. Please visit each to see their other work.

They work by identifying the pitch of nearby ambient sound, such as the whir of a jet engine or the collective hum of a coffee shop full of people; they're most effective in places where the overall sound and volume remain constant.   Ear tips are important, but why does everyone keep ignoring them? With your previous earphone, it’s very possible that you’re not getting the right fit with ear tips, and that can have consequences like poorer sound quality, worse isolation, and discomfort.We’ve simply spend several month in order to test a hundreds set of earbuds in our test fixture to see how each style, material and size affects the sound, fit and isolation. Custom fit ear tips provide a good seal, which is the single most important thing you can do to make your music & ANC sound much better.We have noticed, there are a few variables when it comes to picking out the right ear tips. But like any good recipe, once we understand all of the ingredients and what pairings work, thats make our final product is that much more enjoyable. All it takes is how to define we plan on using Zuno earbuds and figuring out what style and material seem the most fitting. - 6 pairs of silicone ear tips with 2 different shapes- 3 pairs of memory foam ear tips for special ear shapes and uses   Making or answering calls in a noisy environment can be a nightmare, and you can tell that your caller is struggling to make sense of what you’re saying because there’s usually lots of “Excuse me”, or “What? I cannot hear you!” or “Sorry, can you please repeat that?” So much so that you have to leave that environment briefly (if you can), answer your call and then come back in.  The 11mm Titanium dynamic speaker, equipped with 100% recycled aluminium alloy, is carefully tuned by our professional sound engineers and delivers HQ sound and music. We carefully adjusted the low, medium and high frequency to display rich, detailed, clear and premium sound.Zuno's chipset, combined with Bluetooth 5.0, ensures audio and video sync perfectly. You can enjoy a stable and strong connection while watching your videos.With AAC and SNC codecs technology, Zuno performs better with lower lag than ever before. That's how it empowers playing and gaming experience.Zuno was designed for ALL DAY use, with high-capacity battery allow for 1 full charge from the earbuds of continuous audio playback and an additional 3 times charges from the case. With Zuno, you can extend your battery life by 8 hours. In fact, you can use your earbuds non-stop for 15 straight hours on ANC mode only. Need a quick charge? Just 10 minutes in the case gives you 120 minutes call.When you use Zuno, battery life is a non-issue, you can talk for as much as you want, work out for as long as you want, and listen to music for the entire day.  Worried whether your earbuds will stop working if they get wet? Stop worrying; thanks to IPX5 technology, you can make calls outdoors in the rain. Water wetting your Zuno earbuds is not a problem at all. Whether you spill a glass of water on them, or they fall in a puddle, your Zuno earphones will still work flawlessly.   We have collaborated with our French designers to make Zuno earbuds stand out from our competitors. Zuno earbuds combine simple & minimalist design with French elegance.  Jonathan & Jonathan, the two French founders of Doppler Sound, established an HQ office in Hong Kong, Kowloon, and brought together a team of audio enthusiasts.

Introducing - PowerDeWise CharisMic! This innovatively designed lapel microphone combines an easy-to-use magnetic clip with customizable badges for an individual style. Clear sound is the foundation to which we add extra comfort as you have never experienced before. The result: an easy-to-use mic that truly stands out. It’s time to start creating content with a twist. Our unique badge design will highlight your appearance on any social media platform - YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, etc. 

 
A VERY interesting TEST... :) Thanks to the original magnetic swap system, you can set the mic up in just a few seconds and in more ways than one. Choose from 4 options:​ Place the mic under your clothes and clip a badge on top.
  Position the clip in a suitable position and attach/detach the mic freely.
  Use the magnetic holder under your T-shirt to position the mic on your clothes.  Place the mic on your body and clip it with the patch to make the mic completely invisible.
   It has never been easier to start shooting a video with a lapel microphone set up in seconds. The magnet swap system completely removes the headache with lapel mics. Now your mic is ready to go in just a few simple moves. Thinking ahead, badges can create a subliminal association between the speaker and a specific emotion, action, or theme. By wearing a “like” or “bell’ badge you subtly motivate the viewer to push those buttons. Magnetic badges are not only about the style they’re actually an influencing tool.  We have custom-designed the electronics and have only used Grade A components to offer the highest level of performance, reliability, durability, and ease of use.   You'll find the right badge to go with any content type, be it streaming, teaching, podcasting, or interviewing.  Can the CharisMic be attached like a common lapel mic?  Of course. It still comes with a familiar clip, also magnet-based, secured to your clothes. This way, you can have the clip on you and connect the mic freely without setting up the clip over and over again.  Stylish mic? Invisible mic? Innovative magnetic clip? All that in one box!    By studying the needs of our customers and thinking ahead, we have combined innovation with style and have kept the quality of our microphones consistently high.  Despite the bright and eye-catching badges, CharisMic can also be the opposite. Sometimes you need a mic to be invisible. That is why we have provided body patches for you to get the viewer’s attention fully focused on your charisma.  The mic is compatible with all video equipment. It’s easy enough for new users and variable enough for professional content creators.  You only need to choose an adapter for your device.  Every CharisMic comes with a TRRS plug and a TRRS to TRS adapter in the box. So you can use it with smartphones by connecting directly with a 3.5 mm input and DSLRs, camcorders, or any recorder through a 4-3 PIN adapter, which we have put in the box for you.Furthermore, for true compatibility, we’ve created various device-specific options. Choose the Lightning adapter or the Type-C adapter in Add-ons.  A wide range of badges allows you to choose any style you want.

<p>Bone conduction technology has been around for decades.  It works on the premises of vibration. With bone conduction speakers, the sound doesn’t travel by air as in conventional headphones, but rather by vibration through solid mediums. When bone conduction speakers are placed around the head, the vibration resonates with the bones of your head producing an acoustic effect unique to you.</p>

Ludwig Van Beethoven eventually became almost completely deaf.  For him to hear, he would attach a metal rod to his piano while clenching it with his teeth.  He became aware of sound because the vibrations transferred from the piano to his jawbone.  His ability to hear the music was no longer entirely dependent upon his ears.</p>

<p>At my core, I have always been a creator. However, as I went through school, university and work, I lost touch with that nature and found myself pursuing a life, which was regarded as relatively ‘risk-less’. I often found myself too busy to do the things that I was curious about, prioritising my time towards education, work and relationships.</p>
<p>By chance, I was lucky enough to stumble upon an article detailing how to build a mini speaker. It was not until I was deeply immersed in building that speaker, that I experienced flow. That one project redirected the course of my life, now I find myself completely immersed in a community of creators and innovators, building things from Electronic Bikes to 3D printers. </p>
<p>In sharing my story with others it became apparent that very few people had experienced this opportunity.  With that in mind, I wanted to start a Social Enterprise to empower people to unleash their Inner Creator. Our goal is to raise enough funds to build a marketplace, where people can actively collaborate, learn new skills and earn money in the process.</p>

<p>AMPLFY has
teamed up with Substation 33, a Social Enterprise, which recycles Electronic
Waste, and provides programs to support people with disabilities and people
seeking long-term employment. In doing so, we have created a positive social
and environmental impact, reduced the cost of our kit, and made the kit easier
to bring to life for our builders. </p>
<p>For every kit
sale, not only will you learn how to build a speaker, but you will also help
teach someone the basic skills and theories of electronics. As our kits use
recycled computer batteries, dismantling and building battery packs is often
too dangerous for people with little to no experience. However, with close
supervision and support, Substation 33 is able to properly train people to
safely and professionally dismantle, assemble and build battery packs. Such
tasks require a basic understanding of electronics, and the skills necessary to use a
Soldering Iron. These people are also learning other essential skills such as
teamwork and critical thinking, vital to securing positions in the workforce. </p>

The Problem with the Bluetooth Speaker Industry: 

Speakers are no longer built to last. It is common practice to replace an entire unit once a better version is released or technology improves. This adds to our electronic waste problem. 
The majority of portable Bluetooth speakers are manufactured in foreign countries with poor working conditions, where workers receive less than the living wage they actually require.
Mass manufacturing has reduced the price of speakers, however customers still pay high premiums due to marketing efforts and increased perception of value. In most instances, these margins are not dispersed evenly among all employees of the company. 
R & D Investment goes directly towards innovations in speaker technology, however ignores issues which need our immediate attention, such as environmental and social issues. 
Due to the highly competitive nature of the market, traditional businesses have no incentive to share their learning and knowledge with customers and competitors. 



A Revolutionary Platform:
Not everyone wants to build their own speaker, that’s why we want to give people the ‘choice’ to purchase unique speakers, which are built locally, are better for the environment and have a positive social impact.





How AMPLFY Does it Better:

A speaker designed to last – which can be upgraded / fixed at any time.
Anyone is able to build a speaker and earn money from selling it.
A completely transparent marketplace, where money is paid directly to the person who built the speaker.
Speaker innovations are derived from the crowd and money that is spent on each kit helps address environmental and social concerns.
AMPLFY is incentivised to share knowledge with the community, in order to improve the overall quality of speakers within the marketplace.

<p>Each OTO controller houses an IMU and touch electrodes that communicate with a host computer via a lightweight Bluetooth 4.0 stack. The host computer or mobile device translates the raw physical data into the musicalized output that users hear and see. MIDI notes, CC data, frequency bands and filter-sweeps, even visualizations… with OTO the possibilities are endless: play synths, DJ, perform live electronic music, and even control your favorite Digital Audio Workstations such as Ableton and Traktor. Each set of OTO controllers will ship with a suite of both standalone and DAW controller software, meaning both novice and experienced artists, musicians, DJs alike can use OTO exactly how they want.</p>

 You can use OTO on its own as a synthesizer interface and DJ tool with our custom software on Desktop and Mobile, or as a MIDI controller for your favorite Audio Software that you're already using.


Each OTO controller houses an IMU and touch electrodes that communicate with a host computer via a lightweight Bluetooth 4.0 stack. The host computer or mobile device translates the raw physical data into the musicalized output that users hear and see. MIDI notes, CC data, frequency bands and filter-sweeps, even visualizations… with OTO the possibilities are endless: play synths, DJ, perform live electronic music, and even control your favorite Digital Audio Workstations such as Ableton and Traktor. Each set of OTO controllers will ship with a suite of both standalone and DAW controller software, meaning both novice and experienced artists, musicians, DJs alike can use OTO exactly how they want.
     FAQ:How does it work?OTO is a combination touch and gestural multimedia controller. A plastic polyhedric enclosure houses a combination gyroscope/accelerometer, capacative touch-sensors, and a micro-controller, which connect via Bluetooth to a host computer or phone, where our custom software musicalizes the sensor data according to the context.Does OTO require special software?OTO runs with our custom software that includes tabs for Synthesizer, MIDI, DJ, and VJ functionality on Desktop, and Synth/DJ functionality on Mobile. You can use OTO with nothing but the included software, or use it to control other Audio software via MIDI/OSC.What operating system do I need?The OTO Desktop software is available on Windows and OSX. Note that Windows users should have Windows 10 with Bluetooth 4.0 supported hardware. OSX users with a pre-2013 Mac will need to purchase a BLE-USB dongle (widely available for ~$10) to add BLE support for their Mac. We are also working on a mobile app for iOS 9.0 and above (still pre-release, but to be bundled with IndieGoGo shipping).How does it charge?You can charge OTO wirelessly using any QI-compliant wireless charger. You can also charge it directly via micro-USB using the internal charging port.",10.0,1,"1 Campaign

<b>Plasma</b><br/>
</div>
<div>
<p>Plasma is one of the four fundamental states of matter, the others being solid, liquid and gas. A plasma has properties unlike those of the other states. </p>
<p>A plasma can be created by heating a gas or subjecting it to a strong electromagnetic field applied with a laser or microwave generator. This decreases or increases the number of electrons, creating positive or negative charged particles called ions, and is accompanied by the dissociation of molecular bonds, if present.</p>
<p>The presence of a significant number of charge carries makes plasma electrically conductive so that it responds strongly to electromagnetic fields. Like gas, plasma does not have a definite shape or a definite volume unless enclosed in a container. Unlike gas, under the influence of a magnetic field, it may form structures such as filaments, beams and double layers.</p>

<div><b>Ferrofluid</b></div>
<div>
<b></b><p><b></b></p>
<p>A ferrofluid is a liquid that becomes strongly magnetized in the presence of a magnetic field. Ferrofluid was invented in 1963 by NASA's Steve Papell as a liquid rocket fuel that could be drawn toward a pump inlet in a weightless environment by applying a magnetic field.</p>
<p>A ferrofluid is a stable colloidal suspension of sub-domain magnetic particles in a liquid carrier. The particles, which have an average size of about 100Å (10 nm), are coated with a stabilizing dispersing agent (surfactant) which prevents particle agglomeration even when a strong magnetic field gradient is applied to the ferrofluid.<br/></p>
<p>When a magnetic field is applied to a ferrofluid, the magnetic moments of the particles orient along the field lines almost instantly. The magnetization of the ferrofluid responds immediately to the changes in the applied magnetic field and when the applied field is removed, the moments randomize quickly.<br/></p>

<b>
</b><p>Texas Instruments' LM48901 is a quad Class D amplifier that utilizes Texas Instruments’ proprietary spatial sound processor to create an enhanced sound stage for portable multimedia devices. The Class D output stages feature Texas Instruments’ edge rate control (ERC) PWM architecture that significantly reduces RF emissions while preserving audio quality and efficiency. The LM48901’s flexible I²S interface is compatible with standard serial audio interfaces. A stereo differential-input ADC gives the device the ability to process analog stereo audio signals.</p>

</b><p><span>Spatial audio is a term applied to the reproduction of sound by electronic or mechanical methods that attempts to artificially re-create the real-world listening experience of sounds. Alternatively, it attempts to artificially alter reproduced sounds to create a perceived spatial environment that may not have originally existed.<br/>
<br/>
The principle of spatial audio reproduction is simple: If the reproduced sound waves arriving binaurally at your eardrums are identical to those of the real audio source at a particular position, you will perceive the reproduced sound as coming from a source at that position. It does not matter whether the sound source originated at some other position. The sound data arriving at your ears is what the brain processes to ultimately characterize all aspects of the sound.</span></p>

<p><b>Bluetooth &amp; Airplay</b></p>
<p>With the plasma &amp; Ferrofluid speaker, you can choose and enjoy both audio connection - Airplay and Bluetooth.</p>
<p><b>Bluetooth</b> is a universal wireless platform that is found in a wide range of electrical devices that includes mobile phones, laptops, cameras, printers, household items and even cars. Bluetooth speakers allow audio to be played wirelessly from one device to another connected device. </p>
<p><b>AirPlay</b>, on the other hand, is Apple’s own proprietary Wi-Fi dependant wireless platform, enabling users to stream digital audio or video content to other AirPlay-supported devices.</p>
<p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442207324/cp46kxnyb44votdgubno.png"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p>
<p><b>Bluetooth Pros:</b></p>
<p>One benefit of Bluetooth is its extremely wide application, working with a number of devices and operating systems. This is why you’ll find Bluetooth devices that run  Android or Windows Phone, not just those running Apple’s iOS software.</p>
<p>With Bluetooth it is possible to control only the volume of the original device that your music is streaming from, not the connected device (such as the wireless speaker).</p>
<p>Bluetooth is capable of sounding very good. The Minx Air range, for example, supports not only the Standard Bluetooth Codec (SBC), but also AAC and aptX. This means that if your phone, tablet or computer supports AAC or aptX, audio will be sent, received and processed using this higher grade codec than SBC.</p>
<p><b>Bluetooth Cons:</b></p>
<p>Unlike AirPlay, Bluetooth-connected devices need to be close proximity. This is typically 10 to 15m, compared to a potentially much large network with AirPlay.</p>
<p>Bluetooth streams in lossy compression, which is not as good as AirPlay’s lossless compression.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442208209/xem4vsqceeuhppinq5oe.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><b>Airplay Pros:</b></p>
<p>AirPlay has the capability of playing across a much larger distance between devices than Bluetooth. This means that instead of a range of 10-20m between devices, distance is limited only by the reach of the Wi-Fi network over which it connects.</p>
<p>Furthermore, AirPlay uses lossless compression, but anything streamed over Bluetooth uses lossy compression.</p>
<p>AirPlay offers direct communication between the iOS device and the AirPlay speaker, including volume control.  When using AirPlay you’re actually capable of controlling the volume of the Airplay speaker (not just the volume of the iOS device).</p>
<p>Being on a home network generally offers a much better range than Bluetooth (which, a point-to-point wireless system has a range of 10 to 15 metres). This means that you can leave or walk about the room and your AirPlay speaker will keep playing as long as the AirPlay connected device is still within reach of the network.  When connected on a good solid network, AirPlay is very robust.</p>
<p><b>Airplay Cons:</b></p>
<p>One of the disadvantages of using AirPlay is that the products have to be networked – this varies in complexity, depending on the network and device, but is generally a relatively straightforward procedure that is not dissimilar to Bluetooth syncing.</p>
<p>AirPlay is only available on Apple and a small number of other certified devices.</p>

Sound reactive wifi & bluetooth speaker



Plasma & Ferrofluid speaker will give you a truly unforgettable experience with a fascinating plasma arc and a mysterious ferrofluid!!  Also, two Hi/Mid speakers and one bass speaker let you dive into a rich and an attractive sound. You can simply choose Plasma speaker or Ferrofluid speaker for your visual satisfaction.


Stunning visual effects


Plasma speaker has a transparent cylinder at the top of the body and a fascinating plasma arc safely react to sound in the cylinder. You can see real plasma arc dancing in front of your eyes!!! 


Plasma speaker prototype test

Ferrofluid speaker has a same transparent cylinder with ferrofluid. This mysterious black liquid contains nano particles of a magnetic solid and react to sound. Since the Ferrofluid speaker shares the body and the sound board with the Plasma speaker, it is also on a final stage of making a prototype.

Technical Background


Plasma


Plasma is one of the four fundamental states of matter, the others being solid, liquid and gas. A plasma has properties unlike those of the other states. 
A plasma can be created by heating a gas or subjecting it to a strong electromagnetic field applied with a laser or microwave generator. This decreases or increases the number of electrons, creating positive or negative charged particles called ions, and is accompanied by the dissociation of molecular bonds, if present.
The presence of a significant number of charge carries makes plasma electrically conductive so that it responds strongly to electromagnetic fields. Like gas, plasma does not have a definite shape or a definite volume unless enclosed in a container. Unlike gas, under the influence of a magnetic field, it may form structures such as filaments, beams and double layers.





Ferrofluid


A ferrofluid is a liquid that becomes strongly magnetized in the presence of a magnetic field. Ferrofluid was invented in 1963 by NASA's Steve Papell as a liquid rocket fuel that could be drawn toward a pump inlet in a weightless environment by applying a magnetic field.
A ferrofluid is a stable colloidal suspension of sub-domain magnetic particles in a liquid carrier. The particles, which have an average size of about 100Å (10 nm), are coated with a stabilizing dispersing agent (surfactant) which prevents particle agglomeration even when a strong magnetic field gradient is applied to the ferrofluid.
When a magnetic field is applied to a ferrofluid, the magnetic moments of the particles orient along the field lines almost instantly. The magnetization of the ferrofluid responds immediately to the changes in the applied magnetic field and when the applied field is removed, the moments randomize quickly.







Digital audio amplifier board : Texas Instruments' LM48901


Texas Instruments' LM48901 is a quad Class D amplifier that utilizes Texas Instruments’ proprietary spatial sound processor to create an enhanced sound stage for portable multimedia devices. The Class D output stages feature Texas Instruments’ edge rate control (ERC) PWM architecture that significantly reduces RF emissions while preserving audio quality and efficiency. The LM48901’s flexible I²S interface is compatible with standard serial audio interfaces. A stereo differential-input ADC gives the device the ability to process analog stereo audio signals.

<p>The ""Blue Aura WS80i"" speakers have an integrated 45 Watt amplifier.

<h2>Wireless speakers + m:streamer = Soundbar alternative</h2>
<p>Connect the TV with a digital or analog audio cabel to the m:streamer and enjoy sound in HD quality. AMAS Home is an alternative to an expensive soundbar and supports more than only TV sound. It integrates thus all living room components: Control the TV with the m:remote and listen to high quality sound with the m:streamer and the wireless speakers. Since all connections are wireless, you can hide the m:streamer in one of your cupboards.</p>

<h2> </h2>
<h2>Why AMAS Home?</h2>
<p>There are a lot streaming solutions out there, misusing terms like ""multiroom"", comparing Wifi with Bluetooth, focusing only on one way to connect, or hyping their app. We don't want to be another brand like that. Our believes are different:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490772039/upu8tnz4flvoosqssqij.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We are convinced that an app is not enough! Just have a look at the following situation: ""Can you turn down the volume a little bit?"" ""Yeah sure, let me just get my phone, search the app on the screen, open it, click on the volume button and turn it down"". Having an app is nice, but does not fully satisfy the consumer's needs. That is why developed the m:remote. Colored display with self-updating information like an app, fast response like a remote.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490715709/vbjlctfdabmj1nrsaegl.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The room with most of the home entertainment devices is the living room. TV, DVD-player, stereo system - you name it. And every single device has its own remote control. But the m:remote is not just one of them. You can control all your home entertainment devices with it. So, get rid of all the rest. The quick access allows you to switch to your favorite device with one click. We think that an allround experience is important and that includes more than just the music itself.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490715732/zx0qtalywxbltfyu14rk.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We think there should be no compromises when it comes to connectivity. Have a look at the big streaming brands: They mostly focus on Wifi. But what if you want to connect your existing stereo system you bought years ago and which sound still fascinates you? Oh, yeah now you have to buy a separate device. What if you want to use your new streaming-enabled wireless speaker as a TV sound system? You realize the speaker doesn't provide a line-in option, so you have to buy an expensive soundbar additionally. We don't do compromises: Digital, analog, line-in, line-out, USB, Wifi, Ethernet, Bluetooth, UPnP - we have it all. So why buying two seperate devices? With AMAS Home you have all-in-one.</p>

<h2>You love music in the kitchen? Then keep on reading ...</h2>
<p>AMAS Home Kitchen provides you with the best sound in the kitchen. This solution comes with the m:streamer plus, which includes all m:streamer and AMAS Home features as described above and additional an integrated amplifier with 2x50 Watt and 1x100 Watt power. The ""Canton CD 150.2"" passive speakers fit perfectly above your kitchen cupboards and the 100 Watt Subwoofer behind the skirting board of a standardized kitchen. Listen to high-quality sound without seeing any speakers or the stereo system. Enjoy an invisible sound system!</p>

</div></div>","Control more than music
With AMAS Home you can not only stream music in HD quality. With the remote control you can additionally control your home entertainment system. Have the allround living room experience: control music and the TV. All components are connected wirelessly, so you can simply hide the system behind cupboards. AMAS Home is a soundbar alternative: Simply connect it to your TV and have the perfect sound experience while watching movies.


 
A unique way to control music and more
The m:remote can not only send commands, but also receive status information. Its shows playing information like the album cover, artist and album name, as well as other details when streaming music. Via the m:streamer you can control the music flow, create playlists, or set groups to use the multiroom function (multiple streamers needed). It supports RF and infrared, which lets you manage additionally home entertainment devices like your TV, stereo system, or DVD player. A quick-access bar on the bottom of the display gives you access to your favorite devices at any time.

 
Music streaming made easy: The m:streamer
The m:streamer communicates with your home network via Wifi or Ethernet so you can stream your own music from a NAS drive. You have also access to a broad variety of music streaming services like Deezer, or Tidal and thousands of online radio stations as well as podcasts. The m:streamer has an analog as well as digital in- and output, so you can connect a TV, an exisiting stereo and other devices. All these options support HD audio (24Bit/96kHz and 24Bit/192kHz) and gapless playback for the best sound experience.


Optional you can control the m:streamer with your smartphone or tablet (Android and iOS). The m:app is optimized for music streaming and gives you full control:

Change sources of a specific m:streamer (audio server, music streaming service, Online Radio/Podcast, USB, Bluetooth)
Stream songs stored on your phone/tablet
Add songs to the queue
Create and edit playlists
Group streaming clients to use the multiroom function
Change volume of devices seperately
Change system settings

<h3>What is Text-To-Speech?</h3>
<p>Text-to-speech (or TTS, for short) is a type of speech synthesis, which is an artificially constructed voice created from snippets of human voice segments stringed together to create infinite number of sentences. It is called ""text-to-speech"" because the program can then convert what is typed into a computer into spoken language. Speech synthesis itself is the process of creating this functionality. It is what programs like Google Voice, Siri or Cortana or Echo use to communicate with the users. </p>
<h3>What is TTS Yorùbá?</h3>
<p>TTS in Yorùbá is a program to be created for the purpose of turning written Yorùbá text into spoken word/utterances.</p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Why Hasn't This Been Done Before? </span></p>
<p>There have been lots of research and activity on Speech Synthesis for Yorùbá but not many have been successful in being both intelligible and natural: two components that a good synthetic voice must have to be usable. According to Dr. Túndé Adégbọla, the director of the African Language Technology Initiative (ALT-I), in collaboration with Dr. Odetuji Odejobi in OAU Ife, they have ""achieved appreciable levels of intelligibility of synthesized Yorùbá and we are still making good progress with naturalness."" This is good news.</p>
<p>But the big commercial corporations with means to fund research into synthesis have only done it for the large 'marketable' languages, so Yorùbá and other ""smaller"" languages have been left behind.</p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;'>How will it be done?</span></p>
<p>Our purpose for this project is to synthesize Yorùbá for words alone. And so, we would need a   voiceover talent (VT) and a software development team.</p>
<p>This is what Dr. Adégbọlá of ALT-I has to say about our work: ""With more than 5000 names already available on-line at the Yoruba names dictionary project web site, the idea of a narrow domain Yoruba names speech synthesizer is a most welcome next step, which will increase the functionality of the dictionary in quanta.  It will turn the dictionary into a must-consult material for people all over the world who may need to find out the proper pronunciation of Yoruba names.  I see it becoming a broadcasters' delight!"" </p>
<p>Dr. Túndé Adégbọlá is the Director of the African Language Technology Initiative at ALT-I.org <br/> </p>
<h3>Can YOU do it?</h3>
<p>Yes, we can. When we launched the project in 2015, one of the element we spent time working on was this audio element.

<h3>Why is this project important?</h3>
<p>First, we need to create this software so as to convert all the names in the  YorubaName.com Dictionary into audio. This way, users who do not speak Yorùbá but are interested in learning how to pronounce the names will be able to just click on the audio symbols and hear the pronunciation.<br/><br/>The only other way to convert all the 5000+ names in the dictionary into audio format is to have a human being pronounce them all. This is impractical for reasons of cost, time, and most importantly because of the dictionary's open-ended nature, which ensures that there is no upper limit to the number of names it will contain.</p>
<p>But we are considering research into many more ways in which this software can function in other domains in the future. Here are a few:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Accessibility applications</strong><br/>Users who can understand spoken Yorùbá but can't read it - users who are not literate in Yorùbá, blind and visually impaired people, people with other disabilities and young children - will be able to merely input the text into the machine and have it read out to them. TTS can be helpful to open up access to novels (audio books), scripture, text messages, and other texts for this demographic.</li>
<li>
<strong>ATM services</strong><br/>ATM machines around Nigeria today only offer an English interface. A program like this can be incorporated in the software of ATM machines' artificial intelligence to serve customers in their mother tongue. If it can be done for Yorùbá, it can be done for other languages too.</li>
<li>
<strong>Educational applications</strong><br/>As the synthesizer will be programmed to work only with the correctly-placed tone marks, this TTS software can be used in educational contexts to teach both orthography and pronunciation. This can have a net positive effect on the sustenance of the language.</li>
<li>
<strong>Next step: automatic speech recognition</strong><br/>The converse side of this project is something called ASR (automatic speech recognition). If we can successfully train the computer to pronounce Yorùbá words properly from reading a text, then we might also be able to train it to understand Yorùbá speech and convert it to text. This will help in the areas of text dictation, and other AI situations like accessing phone or computer functionalities in Yorùbá (and other languages). See this in action <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/zuck/videos/10103351034741311/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">at Mark Zuckerberg's house</a>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Expansion of multilingual tech applications</strong><br/>Availability of an innovative project usually spurs many other related ideas that can help create more innovations. The Nigerian space is in need of new ideas in language technology, and this project could be a trendsetter.</li>
</ol>
<h3>How Much Do We Need?</h3>
<p>We are raising $4000 for this purpose, broken down as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>$1500 for recording sessions (to include payment of voice-over talent, studio direction and post production)</li>
<li>$1500 for software development to turn audio data into TTS program.</li>
<li>$1000 any other unforeseen costs.</li>
</ol>
<p>As usual, if we do not raise the complete amount, we will make do with whatever we get.</p>
<p>If you can help us in other ways, including but not limited to volunteering (especially with skills in software programming and architecture), please reach out at project@yorubaname.com with ""TTS-Yorùbá"" in the subject.</p>

Text-to-speech (or TTS, for short) is a type of speech synthesis, which is an artificially constructed voice created from snippets of human voice segments stringed together to create infinite number of sentences. It is called ""text-to-speech"" because the program can then convert what is typed into a computer into spoken language. Speech synthesis itself is the process of creating this functionality. It is what programs like Google Voice, Siri or Cortana or Echo use to communicate with the users. 
What is TTS Yorùbá?
TTS in Yorùbá is a program to be created for the purpose of turning written Yorùbá text into spoken word/utterances.
Why Hasn't This Been Done Before? 
There have been lots of research and activity on Speech Synthesis for Yorùbá but not many have been successful in being both intelligible and natural: two components that a good synthetic voice must have to be usable. According to Dr. Túndé Adégbọla, the director of the African Language Technology Initiative (ALT-I), in collaboration with Dr. Odetuji Odejobi in OAU Ife, they have ""achieved appreciable levels of intelligibility of synthesized Yorùbá and we are still making good progress with naturalness."" This is good news.
But the big commercial corporations with means to fund research into synthesis have only done it for the large 'marketable' languages, so Yorùbá and other ""smaller"" languages have been left behind.
How will it be done?
Our purpose for this project is to synthesize Yorùbá for words alone. And so, we would need a   voiceover talent (VT) and a software development team.
This is what Dr. Adégbọlá of ALT-I has to say about our work: ""With more than 5000 names already available on-line at the Yoruba names dictionary project web site, the idea of a narrow domain Yoruba names speech synthesizer is a most welcome next step, which will increase the functionality of the dictionary in quanta.  It will turn the dictionary into a must-consult material for people all over the world who may need to find out the proper pronunciation of Yoruba names.  I see it becoming a broadcasters' delight!"" 
Dr. Túndé Adégbọlá is the Director of the African Language Technology Initiative at ALT-I.org  
Can YOU do it?
Yes, we can. When we launched the project in 2015, one of the element we spent time working on was this audio element. We have figured out the path to success, but we got stuck due to lack of funding and manpower. You can read more about that process in this blog post from 2015.

This technology is DECT and was developed to broadcast audio, something neither Bluetooth or Wifi were originally designed to do. We took DECT and innovated its multi-channel synchronization capability, which can now send perfectly synchronized audio to 16 speakers at once. Since a DECT transmitter isn't build into computers or smart devices yet, we designed a simple and sleek solution, the Helix USB Transmitter, to bring the best wireless listening experience to everyone.</span></span>

<h1 style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">So Why Use DECT Instead Of  Bluetooth Or WiFi?</span></h1><div><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div><div>The simple answer: It just does what they can't. To get into more detail, here's a list of the pains we've felt with the conventional technologies and how DECT makes those pains disappear.</div>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448699847/pjey7axzzgvgznu4tw5z.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>
<div>
<b>Double Compresses Audio</b><br/>Your audio sounds less clear and lower quality. Some manufacturers try to hide this lower quality audio by lifting the low frequencies, giving the impression of more bass. DECT up-samples your audio to 96KHz/24bit delivering beautiful clarity. We don't try to cover up anything. We want to hear all of our music. We think you will too.</div><div><b style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></b></div><div>
<b style=""background-color: initial;"">Not True Stereo<br/></b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Your music sounds one dimensional. DECT enables multichannel synchronization so you can have a truly independent left and right speaker to give an amazing stereo image.</span>
</div><div><b><br/></b></div><div>
<b>Limited Device Connectivity</b><br/>It's difficult, if not impossible, to play through multiple speakers at the same time. With DECT you can connect up to 16 speakers to a single sound source.</div><div><b><br/></b></div><div>
<b>Short Transmission Range</b><br/>You have less freedom in how you set up your system. DECT gives you greater freedom with a 75' indoor / 150' outdoor transmission range.</div><div><b><br/></b></div><div>
<b>Short Battery Life</b><br/>If there's no more power, there's no more music. DECT gives you an industry leading 30 hours of continuos play time on a 6 hour charge.</div><div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448699889/gv6dcqginr97jove2q9e.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div><div>
<b>Internet Dependent</b><br/>If your internet connection goes down, so does your music, even with local audio files. DECT creates a closed network between your music source and your speakers. Your internet, cable, and cell phone service could all go down, but your music will still be playing.</div><div><b><br/></b></div><div>
<b>App Download Required</b><br/>A proprietary app needs to be downloaded, which gives you one more thing you need to sign into and learn how to use. DECT doesn't need a special app. It works with everything you already know and use.</div><div><b><br/></b></div><div>
<b>Complicated Setup</b><br/>Setup can take up to 30 minutes before you can listen to your music. DECT is super simple to set up. Just plug in the USB transmitter, turn on your speakers and you have amazingly beautiful audio in seconds. </div><div><b><br/></b></div><div>
<b>Limited to in App Play</b><br/>You can only play your music through the WiFi speaker manufacturer's proprietary app which only works with services it recognizes. DECT lets you play your music from your media library, any streaming service, or wherever you like. Basically, if it makes a noise, your Helix M Series speakers can play it.</div><div><b><br/></b></div><div>
<b>Not Truly Portable</b><br/>You can only listen to your music in a place that offers a reliable WiFi connection. DECT lets you play your music anywhere you like.</div><div><br/></div><div>

Helix M SeriesThe World's First DECT Wireless Speaker System





Different than Bluetooth or WiFi, they are designed for people who love their music and...





... engineered from the ground up to give you the best wireless listening experience possible, through...




True Stereo ImageHear the full dimension of your music. Perfectly synchronized left and right channels offer an unbelievable stereo experience where you can ""see"" every member of the band on the stage. 








Real HD Audio Resolution Hear the finest detail in your music. Send HiFi lossless audio at 96KHz/24bit, twice the resolution of all other wireless portable speakers. When playing compressed MP3s, they will be normalized and up-sampled, making them sound even better.








Pristine Clarity Hear you music, and only your music. The all digital path and high power efficiency of our technology reduce electromagnetic interference and microphonic pickup, resulting in extremely pure audio. 







Sound that Surrounds Hear your music they way you want. Connect up to 16 speakers to a single sound source to fill out a large space or bring music to multiple rooms. Craft the perfect soundscape for any space and be surrounded by your music.







True Plug & PlaySimply plug in the USB transmitter into your smart device or computer and play your music as you usually would. No special apps or internet connection to worry about. It simply works every time, everywhere. 




Simple Computer & Smart Device SetupThe first video below shows how to connect to a computer for the first time. The second video show how to connect to a smart phone using an OTG cable. It's really easy and simple.







The Power of Our USB TransmitterTo engineer the best wireless listening experience possible, we needed to go beyond Bluetooth and WiFi to a technology that could deliver HiFi wireless audio in a portable system. This technology is DECT and was developed to broadcast audio, something neither Bluetooth or Wifi were originally designed to do. We took DECT and innovated its multi-channel synchronization capability, which can now send perfectly synchronized audio to 16 speakers at once. Since a DECT transmitter isn't build into computers or smart devices yet, we designed a simple and sleek solution, the Helix USB Transmitter, to bring the best wireless listening experience to everyone.












30 Hour Battery LifeListen to your music longer and have piece of mind that your speakers won't die on you when you need them the most. From a single 6 hour charge, your Helix M Series speakers will have enough power to continuously play for 30 hours. 








Longer Transmission RangeSpread out your speakers to truly fill the space. Indoors, you can place your speakers up to 75 feet away from your transmission source, and outdoors, you can place them up to 150 feet away. 







Sustainable & StableDECT operates on its own 1880-1980Mhz connection so your audio doesn't put further strain on your limited WiFi bandwidth, nor will your audio cut in and out when your WiFi bandwidth is clogged. Your Netflix binge watchers will thank you!




So Why Use DECT Instead Of  Bluetooth Or WiFi?The simple answer: It just does what they can't. To get into more detail, here's a list of the pains we've felt with the conventional technologies and how DECT makes those pains disappear.


Double Compresses AudioYour audio sounds less clear and lower quality. Some manufacturers try to hide this lower quality audio by lifting the low frequencies, giving the impression of more bass. DECT up-samples your audio to 96KHz/24bit delivering beautiful clarity. We don't try to cover up anything. We want to hear all of our music. We think you will too.
Not True StereoYour music sounds one dimensional. DECT enables multichannel synchronization so you can have a truly independent left and right speaker to give an amazing stereo image.

Limited Device ConnectivityIt's difficult, if not impossible, to play through multiple speakers at the same time. With DECT you can connect up to 16 speakers to a single sound source.
Short Transmission RangeYou have less freedom in how you set up your system. DECT gives you greater freedom with a 75' indoor / 150' outdoor transmission range.
Short Battery LifeIf there's no more power, there's no more music. DECT gives you an industry leading 30 hours of continuos play time on a 6 hour charge.
Internet DependentIf your internet connection goes down, so does your music, even with local audio files. DECT creates a closed network between your music source and your speakers. Your internet, cable, and cell phone service could all go down, but your music will still be playing.
App Download RequiredA proprietary app needs to be downloaded, which gives you one more thing you need to sign into and learn how to use. DECT doesn't need a special app. It works with everything you already know and use.
Complicated SetupSetup can take up to 30 minutes before you can listen to your music. DECT is super simple to set up. Just plug in the USB transmitter, turn on your speakers and you have amazingly beautiful audio in seconds. 
Limited to in App PlayYou can only play your music through the WiFi speaker manufacturer's proprietary app which only works with services it recognizes. DECT lets you play your music from your media library, any streaming service, or wherever you like. Basically, if it makes a noise, your Helix M Series speakers can play it.
Not Truly PortableYou can only listen to your music in a place that offers a reliable WiFi connection. DECT lets you play your music anywhere you like.

<p><strong>Game Play</strong></p>
<p>Film and game producers know the importance of music and sound in their work. It can turn any ordinary experience into a spiritually enriching one. In fact, audio in gaming is even more vital. Apart from the passive cinematic scores, games rely on interactive sound and music during gameplay to engage with gamers. To become successful, games today need to invest millions and work with top composers to develop their scores and sound effects.</p>
<p>Sadly, PC gamers are denied of audio performance that does their gaming justice. None of the “high-end” sound cards feature advanced DAC chips. They all have high distortion IC based output stages and they all use very noisy Class-D power supplies. The most powerful soundcard outputs less than 100mWatt (0.1 Watt) into headphones. Such soundcards not only degrade the whole gaming experience but also affect the gamers ability to respond to situations crucial to the success of their campaign.</p>
<p>The Burson Play features the SABRE32/ESS9018 DAC chip and Xmos USB receiver chip. Both are technological benchmarks in the audiophile industry. To minimise distortion, the Play is tuned to operate in pure Class-A. Outputting 2000 mWatt per channel, it is over 20 times more powerful than the next best soundcard. To top it off, the Play features a high-performance mic input and fits into any PC case elegantly.</p>

Our OVEVO earbuds realize the dual-track Bluetooth simultaneous transmissionwithout priority or secondarybetween two ears, reducing the delay to 60ms.The gamesound is more instantand exciting. In order to be more comfortable, the designer gives them a more precise circuit board and more rigorous structure, eventually making them the world's narrowest cross section even if your ear canal is very narrow, you can also wear them very comfortable. Inspired by the shape of water drop, this headset is designed to achieve a perfect curve shape with a two-way chain hinge for a comfortable feel and a small and interesting shape.Dual-channel Bluetooth transmission allows the headphone to have no main and auxiliary ear,and the left and right headphone functions are the same.  What does OVEVO Q80 say：

 
The newly developed Bluetooth chip can transmit signal to both sides of earbuds at the same time, reducing the sound delay to 60ms.The data transmission rate is increased to 2 times compared with the previous generation, and the connection is faster and more stable. When listening game the experience is smoother.In order to adapt to different ear types, we design a more precise circuit board, more rigorousstructure, and develop the world's narrowest cross section, even if your ear canal is very smallto wear very comfortable.pe.Customized large/medium/small crescent ear flaps, the ear flaps are made of custom soft rubber; if the ear canal is narrow, you can also remove the ear flaps and use the bare earphones directly.HIFI moving iron version uses the top equipment in the field of speaker unit: full-frequency moving iron speaker, with dual-track Bluetooth 5.0 chip, making Q80's tri-band resolution reach HIFI level, bringing you the immersive sound quality experience.  It adopts a 6mm diameter moving ring horn, specially designed with long sound cavity, and then optimized by the tuner to make the middle and low frequency  powerful, melody belt, showing a clear and transparent sound quality.The Bluetooth 5.0 chip has a built-in high-resolution decoder, which is supplemented by high-audio encoding technology.

<h3>OUR STORY</h3>
</div><div> <p>The PowerTRIP Boomr-Duo was created by <a href=""www.productcreationsgroup.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Product Creations Group</a>. </p>
<p>Product Creations Group (PCG) is a team and network of Product Developers, Dreamers, and Manufacturers. </p>
<p>Based in Austin Texas, PCG created the PowerTRIP Lifestyle Electronics Brand and now the Boomr-Duo. </p>
<p>The PCG team was founded by Zachary Martin, and started by licensing products to other brand labels. Our team has always had a passion and talent for developing quality electronics that support active and adventurous lifestyles. With<span style=""background-color: initial;""> our own brand label, we can finally build items to our own higher standards without compromise to quality for distributors who want cheaper production costs.</span></p>
<p>Our team has been designing and building products for 6 years. However, we've just recently begun our journey with our own brand label. Your contribution will jump-start our production of the new Boomr Duo and allow us to show real viability in the retail market. With success, we plan to expand our team of innovators and add more exciting Lifestyle Electronic innovations to the PowerTRIP label.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We couldn't be more thankful to our fans who have encouraged us to take this leap and our Pre-Sale Investors who will ultimately make it happen!</p>
<p>We are production ready today! All prototypes have been tested and approved by our talented team of Product Engineers, Designers, &amp; Quality Control Specialists. Our factory is on Stand-by and production time is only 30 days.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for your support!</p>

<h3>WHO WE ARE</h3>
</div>
<p>PCG was founded and organized by Zachary Martin in 2010. It can be said Product Creations Group started much earlier as Zach began developing his first successful product long before PCG was founded. Zach was born in Kansas with an entrepreneurial trail blazing spirit. Zach learned early the key to his passion is connecting talented Inventors and Product Developers to collectively build innovations into real products available to the mass market.</p>
<p>After developing the first emergency cell phone charger, Zach founded Product Creations Group. The initial product launch sold nearly 1 million units with a successful TV campaign in 2010.</p>
<h3>PCG VISION</h3>The PCG vision is simple, bring innovative creators and inventors together to build ideas into products which solve real world problems, help people, inspire youth, and enjoy the adventures along the way.</div><h3>CAMPAIGN GOAL</h3><div> <p>Our goal is at least 1,000 pre-sale orders.

OUR STORY
 The PowerTRIP Boomr-Duo was created by Product Creations Group. 
Product Creations Group (PCG) is a team and network of Product Developers, Dreamers, and Manufacturers. 
Based in Austin Texas, PCG created the PowerTRIP Lifestyle Electronics Brand and now the Boomr-Duo. 
The PCG team was founded by Zachary Martin, and started by licensing products to other brand labels. Our team has always had a passion and talent for developing quality electronics that support active and adventurous lifestyles. With our own brand label, we can finally build items to our own higher standards without compromise to quality for distributors who want cheaper production costs.
Our team has been designing and building products for 6 years. However, we've just recently begun our journey with our own brand label. Your contribution will jump-start our production of the new Boomr Duo and allow us to show real viability in the retail market. With success, we plan to expand our team of innovators and add more exciting Lifestyle Electronic innovations to the PowerTRIP label.

We couldn't be more thankful to our fans who have encouraged us to take this leap and our Pre-Sale Investors who will ultimately make it happen!
We are production ready today! All prototypes have been tested and approved by our talented team of Product Engineers, Designers, & Quality Control Specialists. Our factory is on Stand-by and production time is only 30 days.
Thanks so much for your support!




WHO WE ARE

PCG was founded and organized by Zachary Martin in 2010. It can be said Product Creations Group started much earlier as Zach began developing his first successful product long before PCG was founded. Zach was born in Kansas with an entrepreneurial trail blazing spirit. Zach learned early the key to his passion is connecting talented Inventors and Product Developers to collectively build innovations into real products available to the mass market.
After developing the first emergency cell phone charger, Zach founded Product Creations Group. The initial product launch sold nearly 1 million units with a successful TV campaign in 2010.
PCG VISIONThe PCG vision is simple, bring innovative creators and inventors together to build ideas into products which solve real world problems, help people, inspire youth, and enjoy the adventures along the way.CAMPAIGN GOAL Our goal is at least 1,000 pre-sale orders. Our factory partner has agreed to support or campaign pricing at this lower quantity with the shared hope that we can hit our goal or better on Indiegogo and begin growing our sales with orders on the open market. We have many industry players watching and hoping for success.
If we don't reach our goal of 1,000 pre-sale orders, we will still deliver as planned, even if it's only a few hundred units. However, we believe 1,000 pre-sale orders is a modest goal considering our aggressive 2 speaker offer. With so much support and encouragement from our current fans, we are confident we'll make this goal or better.

Here's What You Get!
For your support and generous Pre-Sale Investment, we are offering 2 Boomr-Duos for the retail price of 1 Boomr Duo. This is a $150 value.

They believe that the technology will appeal to all age groups and make streaming music much more simple and efficient.  Frequently Asked Questions HOW DO THEY WORK?Pair Pills are pre-synced Auxiliary devices. Simply plug a pill into each aux jack and press play. It's that simple. HOW WILL THEY HAVE POWER?Pair Pills will have a substantial amount of battery life and offer LED displays to keep track of battery percentage. They will come with a charging dock to connect the Pills to whenever you are not using the set.  WHAT COLOR WILL THEY BE?We plan to provide a wide variety of color choices for our Pair Pills. Leave us feedback... What colors do you want to see? WHEN CAN I BUY A PAIRWe are striving to have Pair Pills available to the public in early 2017. But stick with us and you will be among the first to receive an order!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Who we are:  Chicken-Like Birds</h3>
<p>Most of you who are reading this will know us as that quirky roots duo that acts like a married couple, might as well be siblings but in the end are really just the best of friends.  We play a mix of genres such as swing, rag, blues, country and throw in some elements you wouldn't always expect in those genres.  Essentially our music is a mix of the past meeting the present.  We tip our hats to country blues legends like Mississippi John Hurt, swing aficionados such as Cab Calloway, western swingers like Bob Wills, ragtime rollers, stride champions and country crooners.  We keep one foot planted in the past and one in the present, holding in high regard those that are pushing boundaries today, writing damn good songs and touring like addicts.  Our goal with music is to create songs that have something a bit unexpected in them yet to remain musical and engaging. Our live shows are never the same twice, full of fun stories, a wee bit of dancing, crisp vocals, poignant harmonies, relatable lyrics  and entertaining on-stage banter.  </p>
<h3><b>Our Album:  Wild Returns</b></h3>
<p>This will be our third official recording project during the three years we've been a duo.  Once it was decided to make a new album and utilize Patrick Alexandre as a producer (you might know him as the bass player in the F-Holes or from his solo career or from playing with and co-producing Little Miss Higgins and the Winnipeg Five's Juno nominated album Bison Ranch Recording Sessions) we turned to our fans for guidance in naming our new album.  We asked our email list if they had any ideas what the album name should be and Katie Liebault replied back with the suggestion of Wild Returns.  Needless to say it hit us in just the right spot and soon Ari wrote a song with the title.  It works on a few levels, one where we are expecting wild returns from this album in the form of fame and fortune (haha, kidding!) and also where we are constantly hoping to connect back to that more animal way of being.  Since we have recently made the plunge and moved out to the country we feel like Wild Returns reflects the transition we've recently undergone.  </p>
<p>Track List:</p>
<p>1. Nice Feeling Blues (an upbeat blues song that you will hear in the pitch video)</p>
<p>2. Willy Nilly (a weird song with lot's of time changes)</p>
<p>3. Chicken Coop (an oldie of ours that's been re-done, a true story, a silly silly song)</p>
<p>4. Apple Tree  (a song that Ari wrote while we were recording, inspired by an apple tree in St. Andrews by the sea that Ari had sat under)</p>
<p>5. Dancing on A Cloud  (a swing song for our dancing friends)</p>
<p>6. Bury the Dog  (sometimes you just need to let a relationship go)</p>
<p>7. Wild Returns  (title track, I'd say it is a beast of a song)</p>
<p>8. Ratbug  (a bit of a rockabilly tune about a friends car)</p>
<p>9. Lonely Lullaby  (it's just as it sounds)</p>
<p>10. Ragtime Cowboy Joe  (an old tune from 1912 that we really love)</p>
<h3>The Location - Ghostown Blues in Maple Creek Sask.</h3>
<p>Let's set the scene of where we recorded.  We were on our way back home from our cross Canada tour and planned to record at a cosy pioneer style town/BnB called Ghostown Blues in Maple Creek Saskatchewan.  Though it was only early October, we arrived to a recent dumping of snow and it was quite chilly.  Owner Greg Hisey is a lover of good music and his BnB is a refuge to those travelling musicians who have had the pleasure of befriending him.  He was very interested in our project, and entertained us all week long with cowboy stories and all sorts of wacky anecdotes.  Our week was spent in an old church that Greg had carefully converted into a central dining area/saloon, and which we converted into our personal recording studio.  Patrick arrived and we set to work making homemade baffles out of used pallets, insulation and burlap.  It looked like we had made an indoor stable.  Patricks tape machine, input board, pre-amps, microphones, and chords were assembled, sounds were captured and they sounded goooooood.  Reeeeeeeal good.  Not only was Patrick producing our album but he was also sound engineering and playing drums.  Almost every song on the album was done without any overdubs.  What you hear is the three of us jamming, no punch in's, no tom-foolery, this is what we sound like.  The only exceptions are Patrick adding some killer harp action on Nice Feeling Blues and Ari adding some lofty trumpet on Dancing on A Cloud.  </p>
<h3>Why this project is neat!</h3>
<p>This project will be a very trans-Canada project indeed.  Both Ari and I are from Alberta but have been living in BC for three years and it was recorded in Saskatchewan with a producer from Manitoba on our way home from touring through the eastern provinces.  We went all the way to Newfoundland on our trip, falling in love with Canada's national parks along the way.  We had some amazing house shows in Ontario, crossed the longest covered bridge in New Brunswick, got taken in by lovers of music in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, were captivated by the red mud of PEI, travelled close to 20,000km's and we even went to Hull* and back on this trip.  </p>
<p>*For those that don't know there's a bridge in Ottawa that goes to the Quebec town Hull; my dad was particularly fond of this joke.</p>
<p>ALSO!!</p>
<p>This album is going to have some seriously sweet artwork done by Ari's fiancé, Cate Currie.  And Ari will be doing up a booklet that will have some snippets of our journal entries while we were recording, complete with little drawings and sayings from Greg.</p>
<p><font>This album has been unlike any other album for us from the recording process, to the inspiring location and working with Patrick.  We've already invested into the recording and mixing process and stand behind this project fully.  We believe that you will dig it too.  </font></p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Introducing Very Important Puppets™</h2>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Satirical Digital Assistants</strong></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536754498/h1eqbupbu6kkhvicbzqr.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Very Important Puppets are a hilarious intersection of media, technology, and political satire. Stream music, have a conversation, set alarms, send voice pranks, order food, and have a conversation with caricatures of real-life figures. Unlike Alexa, Siri, or Google Home, VIPs are humorous, and are personality-based with distinct voices and word choices modeled from real people. Rather than being scripted by corporate employees, VIP dialog is continually extracted from public sources, such as Twitter feeds and interviews, and intelligently woven into common home and digital assistant speech. The result is a continuously entertaining assistant.</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""> </h2>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Features</h2>
<p><strong>Features you can expect from the initial release: personal assistant commands including alarms, weather, calendar, sports, and music; and conversational features including messaging, avatars, dictation and conversation. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Puppet to Puppet Interaction</strong> – Puppets can also engage with each other, indefinitely, in a ping pong-like conversation, exchanging commentary, questions, and insults. Get two or more puppets together to start a group conversation and just listen to them debate.  </p>

<p><strong>Alarms: </strong>Tired of waking up to mariachi ringtones? Try a stern warning from a global mafia leader or other silly dialog as you attempt to snooze. </p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Music</strong> – Shuffle music with an integrated Spotify app, or let the characters get their DJ on as they select their favorite tracks with accompanying dance lights. </p>

<p> </p>
</div>
<p><strong>Dictation</strong> – Speak through your puppet using his voice in real time by entering voice or text phrases in your mobile app. Great for pranking your roommate, or your manager if you're brave. Or just do it for the Insta.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Messaging</strong> – If you've been wanting to anonymously fire the entire IT department, now's your chance. Send and share voice messages from your phone by speaking or typing phrases, selecting a voice font, adding a character emoji, then hit Send. Get your point across better than any AR emoji. </p>

<p>We thought our tech is so cool, we filed two trademarks: <strong>Personality Font</strong>® and <strong>Artificial Intelligence Meets Bobbleheads</strong>℠. Spot-on speed, pitch and words make our puppets’ choice of words and voice sound like caricatures of their life-sized compatriots, as they engage you with witty banter. We created a unique dialog engine with a humorous pragmatic parser, which is a sophisticated tool for understanding and generating nuanced language. The voices are built using deep neural network (DNN) algorithms, based on actual speeches and interviews.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""> </h2>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Current Stage of Development</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p><strong>We currently have a working prototype, package design, dialog engine architecture and app design. We're now focused on:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Finalizing the engineering schematics for the final product</li>
<li>Developing and iterating on the user experience for the mobile app</li>
<li>Training the dialog engine</li>
<li>Licensing agreements with branded people and characters. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We will soon begin the process of:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Product certifications</li>
<li>Working with existing supply chain relationships to spec out manufacturing</li>
<li>Shipping logistics</li>
<li>Larger scale production.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Why We Need Your Support</strong></h2>
<p>Your support will allow us to initiate tooling and manufacturing so we can make VIPs available to you and the millions of people suffering from boring, corporate personal digital assistants and home speakers. Let's make our daily routines and personal assistants more engaging, funny, and politically incorrect. </p>
<p>So why should you support us?</p>
<ul>
<li>Be the first to get one (and we mean FIRST).</li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Most unique, best-designed and humorous toy and robot on the market.  </span></li>

</ul>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>​</span></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Stretch Goals</h2>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">The Technology</h2>
<p>While chatbots in ecommerce websites and standalone home devices are becoming commonplace, they focus on baseline Q&amp;A - question and answer. While this is very useful, their conversational style is generic and emotionless. We thought something was missing: personality.</p>
<p>Enter VIPs, a new way of integrating human-like personality traits within the dialogue system. Think of this as the indy version of big tech companies’ robots. We developed a flexible, innovative model of personality based on a multi-dimensional representation. Our proprietary “Personality Matrix ™” model is trained on hundreds of thousands of speeches, interviews and Tweets, spoken by actual, highly-opinionated people. The data we collect is manually labeled by experts according to a carefully crafted set of rules, which map semantic and pragmatic features, such as function, intent, sentiment, and syntax. Machine learning algorithms are trained on our data set in order to match the input from the user to the most appropriate answer, in terms of accuracy, but also injecting humorous and subjective features into the conversation. The result is a library of virtual assistants who talk to you in a caricatured version of their human alter ego. This creates a much more engaging, enjoyable, human-like conversation.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>As this project has both digital and physical components, it poses some unique challenges for the VIP team. Our strategy for this project is to keep it simple: we are only using known, trusted APIs and manufacturing processes with which we feel comfortable.</p>
<p>For the dialog engine, it was important for us to develop a digital framework that enables the conversations with our Very Important Puppets™ to be fun and engaging. To accomplish this, we are using trusted APIs from Google and other vendors, which we will customize to create realistic voices and personalities for our puppets. We have already architected the framework and run working prototypes, and are now working on enriching the dialog. </p>
<p>For the app, we are licensing known, existing APIs, and stitching them together, adding our unique designs. We are not trying to reinvent the wheel.</p>
<p>As with all physical products, dealing with production and shipping is always going to be a challenge. To meet these challenges, we have purposely simplified the product specifications to ensure a smooth manufacturing cycle. Regarding hardware, all we are essentially manufacturing are vinyl dolls, which is a very known manufacturing process with a trusted factory in Shenzhen, and, MP3 players, which are also a known product. Our team is working with experienced industry designers, manufacturers and reputable shipping companies to deliver the best product we can to our customers within a reasonable amount of time.</p>

Satirical Digital Assistants

Very Important Puppets are a hilarious intersection of media, technology, and political satire. Stream music, have a conversation, set alarms, send voice pranks, order food, and have a conversation with caricatures of real-life figures. Unlike Alexa, Siri, or Google Home, VIPs are humorous, and are personality-based with distinct voices and word choices modeled from real people. Rather than being scripted by corporate employees, VIP dialog is continually extracted from public sources, such as Twitter feeds and interviews, and intelligently woven into common home and digital assistant speech. The result is a continuously entertaining assistant.
 
Features
Features you can expect from the initial release: personal assistant commands including alarms, weather, calendar, sports, and music; and conversational features including messaging, avatars, dictation and conversation. 
Puppet to Puppet Interaction – Puppets can also engage with each other, indefinitely, in a ping pong-like conversation, exchanging commentary, questions, and insults. Get two or more puppets together to start a group conversation and just listen to them debate.  





 
Alarms: Tired of waking up to mariachi ringtones? Try a stern warning from a global mafia leader or other silly dialog as you attempt to snooze. 


 
 
Music – Shuffle music with an integrated Spotify app, or let the characters get their DJ on as they select their favorite tracks with accompanying dance lights. 


 

Dictation – Speak through your puppet using his voice in real time by entering voice or text phrases in your mobile app. Great for pranking your roommate, or your manager if you're brave. Or just do it for the Insta.




 
Messaging – If you've been wanting to anonymously fire the entire IT department, now's your chance. Send and share voice messages from your phone by speaking or typing phrases, selecting a voice font, adding a character emoji, then hit Send. Get your point across better than any AR emoji. 


 



Puppet to Person Interaction – Have unique and hilarious conversations with your puppet about anything from current events to the best way to marinate a steak. 
 


 

Customize your puppet avatar with awesome digital swag. 


  
Tech Specs


 
Pairing the Device to your Phone


 

Larger Than Life Personalities

Mr. President – He may not be yuuuuge, but this tiny billionaire will give you a run for your money. With anatomically proportionate hands to match, Mr. President is sure to grab your attention. Comes with a golf club and an attitude.

Comrade – Conniving and methodical, you’re lucky you caught him with his shirt on. The Russian may have you questioning who the real puppet is… him or you? Comes with hockey stick and pile of gold bricks.

Dear Leader – He seems to have all the facts despite banning Google. Don’t push the Supreme Leader’s buttons—you never know what could make him go off. Comes with handheld bazooka. 
Dimensions - 6-inch tall vinyl figure on a 1-inch device. Decorate your office for shenanigans, bring some authority to your home or take them on car rides — VIP puppets are perfectly sized for any room or office.
Picture perfect. Stable on flat surfaces and with movable arms and head, we designed the puppets to be captured from every angle. Add them to your collection of vinyl puppets or give them the spotlight. They would just prefer you don’t share the bad photos.

We thought our tech is so cool, we filed two trademarks: Personality Font® and Artificial Intelligence Meets Bobbleheads℠. Spot-on speed, pitch and words make our puppets’ choice of words and voice sound like caricatures of their life-sized compatriots, as they engage you with witty banter. We created a unique dialog engine with a humorous pragmatic parser, which is a sophisticated tool for understanding and generating nuanced language. The voices are built using deep neural network (DNN) algorithms, based on actual speeches and interviews. Read more about our backend below. 
 
Package Design
Yep, we thought of that, too. We may think outside the box, but we also took time to think about the box itself.


 
Perks

<p>Eric left the biggest wireless audio company in 2014 over consumer protection concerns. Long story short, he was worried about the company's consistent act of putting profits over consumer protection standards. After many attempts to address these concerns failed, he left and moved to Dallas. Eric met with Kenny (a sound engineer in Dallas) in 2015,  and Kryptic wireless was formed. The main focus was, and still is, to bring high quality wireless audio systems to the masses at great prices without compromising on safety and quality. Kryptic wireless has since formed strategic partnerships, both home and abroad to bring the best to our cherished customers. We have  produced some high end speakers over the last 5 years and have received many praises from our customers.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>Kryptic wireless is constantly looking for new ways to improve users’ listening experience through expert audio engineering and problem solving. With the T-30s Wireless headphones, we are delivering users an all-in-one solution by creating a premium listening device that contains multifaceted features to address every users’ audio tech needs. We are confident, you will love this. </p>

<p><b><u>ADVERSE EFFECTS OF LOUDSPEAKER VIBRATION</u>
</b></p>
<p>Sound Engineers &amp; Audiophiles know in order to get the best
possible Sound &amp; Stereo Image from loudspeakers you <b>must
decouple (separate) loudspeakers</b> from distortion-causing surfaces.
The effect of placing a loudspeaker on a wall, metal stand, or
bookshelf creates <b>vibration</b> between the speaker and the surface it
sits on.
</p>
<p>These vibrations cause <b>resonance</b> (interaction of sound energy
between the loudspeaker &amp; the surface it sits on) in the
loudspeaker: <b>this causes sound to distort &amp; blur</b>, resulting in a
loss of definition &amp; presence in the Treble, Mid. &amp; Bass ranges.
<b>This results in a <i>dramatic</i> loss of Sound quality &amp; Stereo
Imaging.
</b></p>
<p>To eliminate <b>distortion</b> in the loudspeaker, you must stop the
interaction of sound energy between the loudspeaker &amp; the surface
it sits on. The VibeFree <b>CR-3 Wall-Mount</b> solves this problem by
suspending the loudspeaker: this gives you the <b>best possible
Sound Quality &amp; Stereo Image. </b></p>

BOOKSHELF LOUDSPEAKERS








CR-3 Wall-Mount: U.S. Patent 29/530248

VibeFree's CR-3 Wall-Mount Loudspeaker Suspension System
separates loudspeakers from distortion-causing, solid surfaces
to give you Hi-Def. Sound & Amazing Stereo Imaging.

The CR-3 Wall-Mount Suspension System was created to offer
you a method of loudspeaker suspension that is beautiful,
effective & safe. 






The CR-3 System is a high-quality product; the result of extensive
research, testing, and refinement. VibeFree products are tested &
endorsed by Professional Sound Engineers. 






- ANTHONY CIMINO-MUSICIAN & SOUND ENGINEER 
_____________________________________________________________________________ 








""We just installed a VibeFree Loudspeaker Suspension System in
our newly redesigned Control Room at our MoJo Pro Recording
Studio. The difference in Stereo Imaging is stunning! I have
never heard loudspeakers sound like this; the clarity is amazing!
The System produced crystal clear sound and stereo imaging in my studio monitors that has to be experienced to be believed"".









- ANTHONY CIMINO, SOUND ENGINEER, MOJO PRO AUDIO
_____________________________________________________________________________ 





Whether you are a professional or listen to music for pleasure, the
CR-3 will vastly improve your loudspeaker performance with a
minimum of installation effort. 



_____________________________________________________________________________ 







ADVERSE EFFECTS OF LOUDSPEAKER VIBRATION

Sound Engineers & Audiophiles know in order to get the best
possible Sound & Stereo Image from loudspeakers you must
decouple (separate) loudspeakers from distortion-causing surfaces.
The effect of placing a loudspeaker on a wall, metal stand, or
bookshelf creates vibration between the speaker and the surface it
sits on.

These vibrations cause resonance (interaction of sound energy
between the loudspeaker & the surface it sits on) in the
loudspeaker: this causes sound to distort & blur, resulting in a
loss of definition & presence in the Treble, Mid. & Bass ranges.
This results in a dramatic loss of Sound quality & Stereo
Imaging.

To eliminate distortion in the loudspeaker, you must stop the
interaction of sound energy between the loudspeaker & the surface
it sits on. The VibeFree CR-3 Wall-Mount solves this problem by
suspending the loudspeaker: this gives you the best possible
Sound Quality & Stereo Image. 







_____________________________________________________________________________ 
""VibeFree Loudspeaker Suspension Systems are great!"" 






- WHIT CRANE, SINGER, UGLY KID JOE & RICHARDS-CRANE

_____________________________________________________________________________ 

""VibeFree Loudspeaker Suspension Systems are great! They will
add huge dynamic range, clarity & imaging to the speaker system
in your home or recording studio. I highly recommend VibeFree Suspension Systems to anyone wanting excellent sound!""
- PHIL DUNGET, SOUND MARKETING RECORDING STUDIOS
_____________________________________________________________________________ 







HOW DOES THE SYSTEM WORK?

(We have an Assembly Video on our www.vibefree.com website) 










The CR-3 suspends loudspeakers by means of a Velcro-
lined, Nylon-webbing Strap with Metal ‘O’ rings sown into
each end. Our Suspension Straps & Adhesive-backed Pads are
made only from U.S. nylon webbing & Velcro materials for
their uncompromising quality.








The loudspeaker is securely held in the Suspension Strap using
the Velcro Hook & Loop Fastening System. The Nylon-webbing Strap is lined with Velcro 'Loop' material that bonds with the Velcro Adhesive-backed pads that are placed on the
loudspeaker (the pads can be removed without damaging the speaker).

The Red steel ‘O’ rings located at each end of
the Strap are suspended off our Patented, vibration-isolating Horizontal Support Rod.

The Wall Plate, Wall-Rod & Horizontal Arm are solid, anodized
Aircraft-quality Aluminum. 





_____________________________________________________________________________ 





WHAT'S IN THE BOX? 











2 Wall Plates, 2 Wall Rods, & 2 Horizontal Arms (assembled) made
from solid Precision-machined Aircraft-quality Aluminum



2 Loudspeaker Suspension Straps (choose from Red or Black).











1 Pkg. Velcro Adhesive-backed Pads



2 Industrial-strength Wall Inserts (will safely suspend a 26 LB. speaker).


Colours: choose from White, Black, or Red.



SPECIFICATIONS
The CR-3 Wall-Mount has been Engineer-designed and
extensively tested. For example:

The CR-3 Suspension System will safely suspend a speaker
weighing 26 LBS (heavier for Custom Orders).

The CR-3 System will suspend a speaker measuring a Max. 17”
High X 10” Wide: custom Orders for larger speakers available

Installation is easy & takes about 1 hour: watch our Assembly
Video on www.vibefree.com 
_____________________________________________________________________________
