Their factory is FSC certified, and we have verified the certificate ourselves. The box and all the game components will be either recycled or made of FSC certified wood and paper from sustainably managed forests.</p><h3>Sustainable design choices</h3><p>While the box might look small, it can fit the same components as other games with boxes twice the size (by volume)! In fact, we sized the game to fit precisely in a small USPS flat rate box for maximum shipping efficiency. This makes a tremendous difference in the shipping impact and cost, while making the game ultra-portable and saving your shelf space.</p><p>In order to save trees and unnecessary packaging, the rulebook for Solutions is fully digital. Simply scan the QR code in the box to access it! This has many added benefits, including that everyone can read the rules at the same time and the rules can be updated with gameplay improvements.</p><p>To further minimize waste, we ask you to provide common items: a stopwatch (your smartphone is fine) and a pencil and paper to draw on. </p><p>All of our game components are made of trees rather than plastic: cardstock, cardboard, and a few wood cubes. </p><p>We avoid plastic packaging inside the game. The only plastic is the shrink-wrap to keep your game safe during transportation.</p><h3>Long-lasting design</h3><p>Solutions will partner with a manufacturer with an excellent reputation for quality. All of our components are designed to be played for decades to come. The cards are made with ultra-premium 350gsm white-core material, which is generally as thick as playing cards come. They will withstand bending and years of rough play.</p><p>The box is made of 1.5mm thick, laminated greyboard, which is the standard for much larger boxes. As a result, not only is the box incredibly sturdy, but the corners are much less likely to tear. The game board is made of 2mm thick, laminated greyboard, the industry standard. We use high-quality black core cards that will better resist bending and rough play.</p><h3>Neutralizing our carbon impact</h3><p>Despite our best efforts to design this game in as sustainable a way as possible, no mass-produced product can yet claim to have no impact without a little bit of help. That’s why we've partnered with Cooler to neutralize our remaining impact. </p><p>Cooler calculates the carbon footprint of every board game we print, including manufacturing, packaging, transportation, and even the air conditioning and lighting of the retail store. They then charge us based on the footprint, and use the money to buy emission permits away from tightly-regulated carbon markets in the U.S. There are only a certain number of permits available, and once Cooler buys up those permits, polluters have to find more sustainable ways to operate, stopping pollution at its source. This is a much more rigorous approach than carbon offsets, since offsets allow polluters to continue business as usual.</p><h3>Supporting Project Regeneration</h3><p>We donate 10% of our profits to Project Regeneration, to help fund their work to foster learning, connection, and action to inspire the regeneration of the world.</p><h2><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1629169059/ms0iyvmrq2ij8zplf8cv.png"" src=""""/></h2><p>Solutions is ready for production. We own the rights for all artwork.

After eliminating manufacturers that looked great on the surface, we have chosen a highly credible manufacturer in China with 10+ years in the business to bring the game to life.</p><p>This is our first Indiegogo campaign. However, we have mitigated this risk by seeking the advice of as many crowdfunding veterans as possible.</p><p>Of course, there are always unforeseen circumstances that can affect the production and shipment of a game. Pandemics (too soon?), material shortages, delays by third parties, strikes and natural disasters are always a remote possibility. The current COVID-19 pandemic is still affecting freight times and prices, which we are doing our best to mitigate by securing multiple quotes from highly credible partners.</p></div>","It’s a race against time to fight climate change. You and your friends must work together to reduce global emissions before it’s too late!

As we receive more information we will do our best to lower these costs if these conditions change.Adding additional copies or add-ons will raise the weight of your pledge and may also raise the final shipping price.Taxes are not included in the pledge prices unless otherwise stated in the reward. Taxes/VAT will be charged based on your country’s rules when you check out in the Pledge Manager.Sustainable materialsWe will be working with LongPack Games, a veteran board game manufacturer. Their factory is FSC certified, and we have verified the certificate ourselves. The box and all the game components will be either recycled or made of FSC certified wood and paper from sustainably managed forests.Sustainable design choicesWhile the box might look small, it can fit the same components as other games with boxes twice the size (by volume)! In fact, we sized the game to fit precisely in a small USPS flat rate box for maximum shipping efficiency. This makes a tremendous difference in the shipping impact and cost, while making the game ultra-portable and saving your shelf space.In order to save trees and unnecessary packaging, the rulebook for Solutions is fully digital. Simply scan the QR code in the box to access it! This has many added benefits, including that everyone can read the rules at the same time and the rules can be updated with gameplay improvements.To further minimize waste, we ask you to provide common items: a stopwatch (your smartphone is fine) and a pencil and paper to draw on. All of our game components are made of trees rather than plastic: cardstock, cardboard, and a few wood cubes. We avoid plastic packaging inside the game. The only plastic is the shrink-wrap to keep your game safe during transportation.Long-lasting designSolutions will partner with a manufacturer with an excellent reputation for quality. All of our components are designed to be played for decades to come. The cards are made with ultra-premium 350gsm white-core material, which is generally as thick as playing cards come. They will withstand bending and years of rough play.The box is made of 1.5mm thick, laminated greyboard, which is the standard for much larger boxes. As a result, not only is the box incredibly sturdy, but the corners are much less likely to tear. The game board is made of 2mm thick, laminated greyboard, the industry standard. We use high-quality black core cards that will better resist bending and rough play.Neutralizing our carbon impactDespite our best efforts to design this game in as sustainable a way as possible, no mass-produced product can yet claim to have no impact without a little bit of help. That’s why we've partnered with Cooler to neutralize our remaining impact. Cooler calculates the carbon footprint of every board game we print, including manufacturing, packaging, transportation, and even the air conditioning and lighting of the retail store. They then charge us based on the footprint, and use the money to buy emission permits away from tightly-regulated carbon markets in the U.S. There are only a certain number of permits available, and once Cooler buys up those permits, polluters have to find more sustainable ways to operate, stopping pollution at its source. This is a much more rigorous approach than carbon offsets, since offsets allow polluters to continue business as usual.Supporting Project RegenerationWe donate 10% of our profits to Project Regeneration, to help fund their work to foster learning, connection, and action to inspire the regeneration of the world.Solutions is ready for production. We own the rights for all artwork. Solutions is based on cutting-edge climate research, all of which will be cited in the rulebook.We rigorously evaluated over 20 manufacturers, emailing dozens of their customers to ensure that they were satisfied. After eliminating manufacturers that looked great on the surface, we have chosen a highly credible manufacturer in China with 10+ years in the business to bring the game to life.This is our first Indiegogo campaign. However, we have mitigated this risk by seeking the advice of as many crowdfunding veterans as possible.Of course, there are always unforeseen circumstances that can affect the production and shipment of a game. Pandemics (too soon?), material shortages, delays by third parties, strikes and natural disasters are always a remote possibility. The current COVID-19 pandemic is still affecting freight times and prices, which we are doing our best to mitigate by securing multiple quotes from highly credible partners.",42.0,7,"1 Campaign

Now she is one of the most famous ascendants in the world, with brand sponsorships from beauty and fashion companies, her own press team, and a prestigious membership in the Star-Spangled Squadron, America’s premier team of crimefighting ascendants. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1585857347/lwfzfvl7qzjvu09czxsu.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Up at the top you can see Aurora's Character Points, Power Limit, and Challenge Rating. <strong>Character Points</strong> (CP) are used to construct characters. An average human has 200 CP. A trained soldier has 240 CP. An exceptionally impressive, formidable and renowned human in the real world has 400 CP.  Every 80 CP represents an approximate doubling of the character’s competency across all capabilities. With 940 Character Points, Aurora is one of the 20 most powerful superhumans in the world. <strong>Power Limit </strong>constrains how  characters can allocate their CP and is analogous to class level in a D20 RPG. <strong>Challenge Rating</strong> shows how powerful a character is relative to a trained soldier. Aurora can defeat 500 US infantry simultaneously - she's a tough woman.  </p><p>Over on the right, below her image, you'll see Aurora's Primary Attributes: <strong>Might</strong> (MIG), <strong>Agility </strong>(AGI), <strong>Valor</strong> (VAL), <strong>Resolve </strong>(RES), <strong>Insight</strong> (INS), and <strong>Charisma </strong>(CHA). Each of these Primary Attributes are rated in <strong>Supermetric Points</strong> (SP). SP are logarithmic; each additional one SP has a value equal to double the amount of the previous SP.  Ordinary people have 3 SPs in each of their Primary Attributes, and the most impressive humans typically have no more than 5 SP in any Primary Attribute. With 7 SPs of Agility, Aurora is four times more agile than an Olympic athlete. With 12 SPs of Charisma, Aurora is 500 times more magnetic and alluring than any ordinary person.</p><p>To the left of the Primary Attributes are Aurora's <strong>Secondary Attributes</strong>, which rate factors like Initiative, Passive Spotting Range, Height, Income, and more. With a Flight Speed of 14 SPs, Aurora can fly at Mach 24!</p><p>Below the Variable Attributes we list Aurora's <strong>Powers</strong>. Her most important Power is <strong>Agile Light Control</strong>. Light Control is a pre-defined <strong>Power Set </strong>that allows her to emulate many other powers.  (The rules let you build your own power sets if you want, yes!)   </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1585857467/siemsalps8tocwldbl3p.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>The word Agile in front of Light Control is a <strong>modifier</strong> that changes how the power works. In this case, it means that Aurora uses her Light Control in conjunction with her Agility rather than her Insight. Between Powers, Power Sets, and Modifiers, there are infinite possibilities available to make virtually any character you can imagine.</p><p>Below Powers we've listed Aurora's <strong>Skills</strong>. Skills can be substituted for Primary Attributes for specific purposes. For instance, Aurora has 14 SPs of Aerial Combat. If she's the target of a ranged attack while she's flying, she can substitute her Aerial Combat score for her Agility score, making her much harder to hit. </p><p>Below the Primary Attributes, you can see Aurora's <strong>Perks</strong> and <strong>Drawbacks</strong>. Perks function similarly to Feats in a D20 RPG. Some of the most important Perks are the Combat Maneuvers, which allow you to trade damage for accuracy and vice versa. Aurora's got two <strong>Combat Maneuvers</strong> as well as a host of other Perks related to her status as a celebrity member of the elite Star-Spangled Squadron.</p><p>Aurora has a number of minor Drawbacks such as her <strong>Code of Honor</strong> (""always be fabulous"") as well as one very serious Drawback called a <strong>Vulnerable State</strong>. A Vulnerable State models all the situations that can result in heroes becoming weaker or losing their powers. Exposed to meteorites from your homeworld? Caught out of your powered armor? Forgot to recharge your power ring? Not angry enough to turn green? All modeled with Vulnerable State. Aurora's Vulnerable State is that all of her powers are based on her egoistic desire to be a star; if she's ever reduced to 0 Determination, she gets depressed, loses her superpowers, and acquires a host of flaws. </p><p>Speaking of <strong>Determination</strong>, that's one of the game's <strong>Variable Attributes</strong>. The other one is Health, and both are listed near the top of the sheet. These are like Hit Points in a D20 Game. Unlike the other Attributes, Variable Attributes aren't rated in SP, just in raw numbers, so that when you deal and take damage it's all scaled correctly.</p><p>As for how the game itself works, it's so easy even a 200-CP ordinary human can play it! Anytime you want to make an <strong>Action</strong>, you choose your <strong>Action Value</strong> (AV) and then subtract the <strong>Difficulty Value</strong> (DV) to yield a <strong>Resolution Value </strong>(RV). You then roll 1d100 on the Challenge Action Resolution Table, or CHART, to see your Color Result. The CHART is carefully structured so that the expected values for any AV versus any RV are exactly what they ought to be, given the logarithmic nature of the Attributes.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1585857608/qzxd9hmffzatrbmwf7t2.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Let's simulate Aurora shooting a Thermal Blast at the blindsighted assassin Helen Killer.

If Aurora fires a Thermal Blast at Helen Killer, her AV for the Attack is 14 SPs and her Base Damage is 256. Her DV for the Attack is Helen's Combat Sense, which happens to be 13 SPs. That gives Aurora an RV of 14 - 13 = +1 on the CHART. Let's say her player rolls a 32. Scanning across the ""1"" row of the RV (Attack) column, we see that 32 falls into the Yellow range, so Aurora has scored a Yellow result on her Attack. </p><p>When you score a Green result when making an Attack, you deal Base Damage, while Yellow, Orange, and Red results increase damage by a factor of 2, 4, or 8.

<h3><strong>Who we are</strong></h3>
<p>We're just two guys who love being around people and having a good time.  Some of our favorite memories from childhood are of playing cards and board games with friends and family. These games brought everyone closer together, made us think and were always a lot of fun.  </p>
<p>We love getting people together and games are fun way to break the ice, so we came up with our own game- Rent 'em Spoons.  Making up a game from scratch isn't as easy as it seems.  We wanted to make a game that was easy to learn, but one that you can play over and over without getting bored.  After a lot of trial and error, we came up with one that has a bit of chance, but you still need the skills to the pay the bills if you want to win.</p>
<p>The game is simple and easy to learn, but you need strategy if you want to stomp with the big dawgs.  Each player gets dealt 4 cards from the deck.  The deck is made of Customer, Soup, Spoon and Action cards. Everyone takes turns drawing and trying to lay down complete sets made of a Customer, Soup and Spoon card.  The first person to get 3 complete sets wins the game.  Of course, we couldn’t make it quite that easy, you have to watch your back.  The Action cards let people jack your cards, skip you, reverse the order of play and few other things to keep you on your toes.  You’ve heard most of the phrases on the Action cards before and the game gets better when you shout them out.</p>
<p>The customers are familiar as well, like <strong>The Original Playa from the Himalayas, Stupid Best Friend, The Big-Eared Trash Talker, That Hood Rat from Across the Hall, Your Crazy Mama </strong>and others.  Addicting and exciting, <i><strong>Rent ‘Em Spoons</strong> </i>is a game that you and your crew will want to play over and over again. You’ll love all the crazy characters and themes in the deck.</p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>Right now, we are looking at you, Indiegogo, for help raising $7500.  This start-up money will cover all the basic costs of making the first run of Rent ‘em Spoons decks and then marketing and distributing our game.  The Rent ‘em Spoons deck contains 70 cards- 15 Customer cards, 15 Soup cards, 15 Spoon cards and 25 Action cards. </p>
<h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3>
<p>Because we have already designed this game and printed out the prototype deck, there is very little risk involved with this project.  Our manufacturer has over 35 years of experience in the gaming printing industry. We are ready to move forward right now, and all that is holding us back is our lack of funding. With your support, we know that we can hit all of our deadlines and send out the games to you quickly, hopefully even ahead of the schedule we have set for ourselves.</p>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>Beyond ordering a deck, you can help us in a <strong>big </strong>way by sharing our campaign with all your friends and family.  Go ahead and post the campaign URL on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram and any other social media platforms you may use.  If you follow blogs, celebs, or journalists, ask them to visit our page and talk about our campaign.  The more people that know of our game, the smoother our launch will go.  We’re even running a contest where you can win a <strong>$500 Visa Gift Card </strong>by sharing the game online!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is James Kathrein, I am the designer of Gravity Dice which are precision, custom CNC machined Metal Gaming Dice. After thousands of requests to create a set of affordable precision RPG dice, I came up with a solution. Our new Dragon Forged Dice campaign will solve the problem of unbalanced, untrue dice. </p>
<p>Dragon Forged Dice will be made from a high resin acrylic glass called PMMA. Our new proprietary methods will give you dice that are true. They will have more random roles because of the system I am using. I have also designed a LED dice case that will hold your dice set and light them up for hours. The dice vault is made from the same PMMA material and custom tooled with a screw top to put your dice in. The vault has changing color options and is rechargeable. </p>
<p>This campaign is important to me because you have asked for it, and because like you, I need to know that my dice will perform for me.  My vision is to design the highest quality gaming products in the industry that will last you for years.  With your support in the campaign I will be able to afford the tooling costs for the vault, LEDs and the dice. Any additional monies over the cost of the tooling will go to adding new colors and variety packs for you. </p>

</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our campaign will solve many problems with the current dice on the market. Current dice are not true, they are unbalanced and lack randomization. We have also designed a truly unique dice holder that we call the Dragon Forged Vault. It has an LED base that gives you multiple colors and is rechargeable. </p>

<li>Our business purpose is to design the highest quality products we can, to bring these products to market and ensure that these products have the smallest carbon footprint we can make for our environment.</li>
<li>You can see my commitment to our industry and our world through my previous Gravity Dice project.

<li>Please join me and lets build better products together, we ask you to back our campaign and be a part of the change.</li>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I have 3D renders and 3D prints of all the dice and the vault. I have also designed the circuit board my self and tested its success. We have not made the product yet. My secret design plan is to create our dice so they don't shrink when they leave the mold, so they aren't weighted to one side and so they roll like no other dice on the market. The challenges are to ensure these plans work. We have just finished our first prototypes and are making adjustments to the numbers on the dice.</p>

<p>Hi, I’m Sasha, a work-from-home Mom to two amazingly intelligent kids. After working for over a decade as a successful Interior Decorator, my life, and priorities changed with the arrival of my children. All of a sudden I was spending a ton of time playing with toys that I felt lacked any kind of intelligence… and, I wondered.. </p>
<p><strong>If we want smart kids, why don’t we give them smart toys? </strong></p>
<p>So I started creating toys made from the fabrics I knew and loved from my decorating days, and those toys that I created were a big hit with my kids, and their friends.. and all of a sudden my Playmats and Quiet Books were in demand.</p>
<p>So, I created TinyFeats, so that I could build toys that inspired and motivated kids. But we need your help to make it happen. Will you help us fill orders for our already popular City Driver Activity Mat? Show your support for the next generation of kids and awesome toys, by funding our Indiegogo campain today.</p>

<p><strong>What makes a TinyFeats Activity Mat so awesome?..</strong></p>
<p>The difference is in the design, our activity mats include more things for your little one to do, snaps, slots, and pockets all help a kid develop and refine their fine motor skills. Going to the car wash or gas station are real life activities that kids long to master, these car themed activities gives kids the opportunity to practice and hone their creative and dramatic play skills. Preparing  them take those vitally important first steps towards independence. </p>
<p>The City Roads Activity Mat is designed to be both fun, and practical too..</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>PORTABLE</strong> - It rolls up neatly and fit into a diaper bag, making it a perfect on-the-go toy for church, waiting rooms, or playdates at Grandmas house.</li>
<li>
<strong>NO LOOSE PIECES</strong> - All the pieces are securely fastened, even the matchbox cars fit into pockets that seal shut. So nothing dangles or gets left behind.</li>
<li>
<strong>HOURS OF FUN</strong> - Both my son and daughter will happily sit and play for hours with this activity mat.</li>
<li>
<strong>MADE FROM FABRIC</strong>! - Soft fabric toys cause less damage to siblings, parents, walls and furniture.. plus, the notable absence of screens, buttons and lights make these toys an ideal quiet time toy, in fact the only sounds you are likely to hear is the heartwarming squeal of delight, or weeeeee, as a car races over the overpass!</li>

<p><strong>We Need Your Help To Make it Happen!</strong></p>
<p>Myself and my little sewing machine just can’t keep up to the demand. </p>
<p>I need your support to expand our production capabilities, the entire $2,000 from this campaign will go directly to purchasing inventory, any additional funding (if we get there) will go towards marketing and creating our next design (a mini car mat). </p>
<p>We need 500 City Driver Activity Mats ASAP. I have found a workroom that can produce our Activity Mat to my exacting standards; using their team of craftsmen we can produce more play mats, faster, and more affordably than I can alone. That means that more kids get more awesome playmats, and parents don’t have to spend as much money for a top quality educational toy for their kids. It’s a win-win for everyone!</p>

But before we can do that, we need stock, and your support.</p>
<p>So please contribute to our Indiegogo Campaign by purchasing a perk and/or spreading the word on Social Media. <i>And, from the bottom of my heart, thank you for your time and contributions, together we can make smarter toys for smarter kids. </i></p>

(thank you!!) The deck featured 52 unique original artworks created in Ink, Tea and Alcohol, the stuff you drink not any kind of painting material!Have a look at the images below - these are my selected 52 images for the new deck. I have also shown some visuals of how the finished decks will look. There are 2 variations - a standard limited edition deck - made by USPCC with a standard tuck and numbered sealA collector's deck with a gilded deck Made by USPCC with a custom tuck produced by Gamblers Warehouse complete with foiling embossing and a custom foil sealAs well as being available in the deck these paintings are available as prints in a playing card format in very limited editions!10 years ago I left a career as an embroidery designer to follow my passion - drawing and painting. At the time it was a huge gamble but over time I realised that I could actually make a living doing what I loved most and to be fair haven't looked back since.. I mainly exhibit work and get involved with projects that excite me and give something back. My work has been exhibited in galleries and fairs all over the world and I am fortunate enough to have had solo exhibitions in London, Brighton, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy and Dubai.",52.0,0,"1 Campaign

Every character you encounter or create is going to be defined in part by virtues such as Loyal and Courageous, as well as at least one vice, like Narcissistic or Lazy.Easy to Learn: The simple, yet elegant game mechanics are easy for newcomers to learn but offer enough depth to enrich your storytelling and create a seamless and enjoyable combat experience. Engaging Design: Full-color and lavishly illustrated, each Endless Realms book is a stunning addition to any gamer's collection, and the thoughtfully-curated art is bound to catch any fantasy lover's eye.   This Creature Compendium contains full-color illustrations of over 250 creatures. This book contains everything you need to encounter, battle, hunt, and even create the creatures of Endless Realms, including: Unique Creature Design: Inside, players will find completely new creatures as well as familiar favorites with an imaginative twist, all creatively designed and skillfully illustrated. The Creature Compendium contains a wide variety of creatures, all complete with lore, stats, and gorgeous illustrations. In-Depth Lore: Every creature comes with a wealth of knowledge about its behavior, habitat, abilities, and physical traits so that every creature encounter is fully fleshed out. Easy-to-Create Custom Creatures: In case 250+ creatures isn't enough for you, the Creature Compendium include rules for creating your own beasts, or for adjusting the strength of an opponent to fit any scenario or group of adventurers",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

Its unique shape allows you to roll and flip it on most flat surfaces.

It not only challenges your skill and tactics, but often also your teamwork with other players!Two years ago, MOKURU - the amazing desk toy was funded on Kickstarter and Indiegogo. This simple wooden stick has endless possibilities, players can come up with their own tricks or master the existing ones. MOKURU is easy to pickup, yet challenging to master as new tricks are always invented! After contacting the MOKURU team, we learned that they have already collected a number of popular tricks from fans and have ranked them from the easiest to the most challenging into “Basic”, “Advanced” and “Master” difficulties. Instead of just publishing a book, we have suggested to turn it into a full board game with complete rules and tokens. With character designs aided by Italian graphic designer and illustrator Valentina Fabbri, MOKURU CARD GAME was born.          
 
 
                           
     MOKURU is an amazing desk toy. It has a simple design with endless possibilities that will test your creativity and dexterity. Play with MOKURU for fun or sharpen your skills and style to become a master. You can even play MOKURU with friends. It’s totally up to you!MOKURU was created upon traditional Japanese wooden toy. After years of development, MOKURU was launched on Kickstarter in 2017 and successfully funded. It has since been distributed worldwide, delivering to over 1 million players in over 100 countries.Today, we are teaming up with the MOKURU team to relaunch as the MOKURU CARD GAME. MOKURU is remodeled once more, this time molded in strong and light plastic, so you can play them at home or at your favorite cafe anytime!               Want to know what people think of MOKURU CARD GAME ?

<h3>Some prettycool Gameplay</h3>

Meet the NEW LEXIO, which will make you lose track of time and get you fully absorbed. The NEW LEXIO has its distinct concept, featuring the engraved images of the sun, moon, stars, clouds, intuitive and jocular special cards, and an all-new score system, all available on Indiegogo.  

 
 
 NEW LEXIO is the world’s one and only board game that brings special cards to both western poker and eastern mahjong. The NEW LEXIO is back, completely renewed with an elemental addition of 18 special cards that were previously inexistent in the well-known original game of LEXIO.  Although the dynamics of the game have been totally shifted with this new way of playing, featuring special cards, the game rules use poker hand rankings just like the original LEXIO. And the game is easy to learn in just 2-3 minutes, allowing the entire family members (including grandparents, grandchildren, and parents) to enjoy the game. Regardless of their age! The NEW LEXIO is equipped with a unique scoring system and tiles that stimulate both your sense of hearing and touch. The NEW LEXIO also works as a phenomenal educational game that twists and turns, giving your brain a good workout.   Meet the NEW LEXIO, which will make you lose track of time and get absorbed in this game. NEW LEXIO has its distinct concept, featuring the engraved images of the sun, moon, stars, clouds, intuitive and jocular special cards, with an all-new score system. All available on Indiegogo.  As the basic rules of NEW LEXIO are taken from poker hand rankings, the game is easy enough for young kids to quickly learn in just 3 minutes. The additionally provided hand-ranking card is written with types, numbers, and names of the hands that can be put out (including Single, Pair, Triple, Straight, Flush, Full House, Four Card, Straight Flush). This allows the players to quickly(easily) enjoy the game, even if they were not taught how to play. Just like the easy-to-learn game rules, the fast and bold determination to win (and not lose) is the NEW LEXIO’s key feature. The playtime of the round itself is less than 5 minutes. With each round taking 3-5 minutes on average, the intriguing elements, and the unusual score counting will prevent the game from getting boring. Players can even keep playing on for 2-3 hours, as you’ll want to replay repeatedly.   The 18 special cards exclusively presented in the “NEW LEXIO” are a new gaming device that wasn’t in the previous version of LEXIO, adding an extra element that overturns the drift of the game. Since a countless number of possibilities can be created according to time and the way of using these cards, they motivate the players to devise killer strategies and trigger an intense brain game.  By using just one single special card, you can see a complete reversal of ranking - The first becomes the last and the last becomes the first - which is why these cards are called ‘Joker Card” or “Changer”. The whole deck consists of 10 Changer cards and 8 Joker Cards (i.e. 2 cards in four different suits each)..  From the “Winner-Takes-It-All” card in which a 1st place winner takes all of the score chips that other players are supposed to get, to the “Unwanted Gift” card in which you give 1 tile of yours to another player, the 18 special cards are full of moves that allow you to take the lead in the game. '  Unlike regular board games where only the 1st place winner gets points, NEW LEXIO has a special scoring system where all players except the last place earn points. Even if you’re not in 1st place, you can still score points which allows all the players to have their chances to make or break the game with their strategies. This gaming system not only motivates players to win the game but makes every round a lot more intense, regardless of how many scores each player got before. It stimulates a mutual competitive spirit among the players as well. After the round is over, you can easily divide the scores by using the LEXIO chips.   Counting scores has been made easy as well with the color chips that can be used while playing the game. The NEW LEXIO has a total of 60 chips with 20 chips for 1 point (yellow), 5 points (green), and 10 points (red).   The NEW LEXIO features a set with themes that symbolize the sun, moon, stars, and clouds. The illustrations representing each of these themes are placed on the bottom-right corner, giving an extra visual element. And not only that, but other engaging elements have also been added to the game, such as deciding who goes first and counting scores depending on the theme and number of tiles in possession.   As the designs on the main tiles have been engraved (not printed) with intaglio, they cannot be easily erased, no matter how many games you play. They are also incredibly durable.   The component tiles that take cuboid shapes (like mahjong) provides a sensuous board game, stimulating your tactile senses with their moderate weight of 0.7 ounces per tile. They also attract the user’s auditory senses with pleasant clicking sounds made when shuffling the tiles.   Plus, having the option of picking a black or white tile reward (according to the individual’s taste of color) adds to the game’s zest. The composition and rules are all the same, so players preferring to feel classy can choose black, and those preferring a cleaner look can opt-in for white.   The NEW LEXIO is a game where the first person to put out all the tiles that have been equally dealt with becomes 1st place, the victor. Putting out a higher tile than the number of tiles possessed by the previous player is the key. If you don’t have a tile to put out, you can pass over your turn.1. Deal the special cards.  - Following the manual, you should deal 3 cards for each player when playing 5 rounds, and even if a player uses a card, no further cards shouldn’t be dealt.- Deal 2 cards for each player when playing without any set rounds, and once a player uses a card, a new card should be given. *Side NoteThe New Lexio is a game where numbers are evaluated prior to the its suits.3 is the lowest and 2 is the highest-ranking number in the tiles. So, the sequence from lowest to highest is: 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,1,2. When the numbers match with other players, then the suits on the tiles are used to evaluate a higher-ranking tile. The suits’ ranks are as follows from high to low, sun> moon> star> cloud.  So, for example, Sun 2 tile is the highest, and the Cloud 3 tile is the lowest.i.e. (Sun 2 > Moon 2> Star 2> Cloud 2> Sun 1>… >Cloud 4> Sun 3> Moon 3> Star 3> Cloud 3) 2. Turn over the tiles and shuffle them well.  3. After dealing an equal number of tiles and scoring the chips, place the tiles in a way that only you can see them.   4. Check to see if there is a player who wants to use the special card <New Beginning>, and if there isn’t, the player holding “Cloud 3” can put out their tiles first. The starting player can lay as many tiles as he/she wants by making any of the combinations in the Reference card (Laying four tiles is not allowed)  - Players can put out just 1 tile or 2-3 tiles, but they must put out tiles with the same number.- A combination should be made when putting out 5 tiles, and the way of combining 5 tiles is just like the game of poker. 5. The next player can only put out the same number of tiles if it has a higher combination.  6. Players should pass when they don’t have a tile to put out, and if everyone passes, the player who played last becomes the lead and can freely put out any tile.   7. If there is a player who has put out all their tiles, the round ends and scores should be counted.  (The ENDING CHANGER special card can only be used during score counting).  - How to count the scores (based on 5 players)The 1st place winner gets points from the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th place players, according to their number of remaining tiles.The 2nd place winner gets points from the 3rd, 4th, and 5th place players according to the differences in their number of tiles, and the 3rd, 4th, and 5th place players’ number of remaining tiles.The 3rd place winner gets points from the 4th and 5th place players according to the differences in their number of tiles and the 4th and 5th place players’ number of remaining tiles.The 4th place winner gets points from the 5th place player according to the difference in their number of tiles and the 5th place player’s number of remaining tiles.The 5th place player gives points to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th place players according to the differences in the number of remaining tiles and cannot get any points from any of the players.• The player who has used all of their point chips is outed from the game from that moment.• After playing 5 rounds, the final rankings should be determined by the number of those possessing point chips.• The game is played in the same way for 2 ~ 4 players.• Starting from the 1st place winner, the scores are given in the order of ranking. The player who has run out of score chips in the middle of giving scores to the higher-ranked player(s) is outed from the game from that moment.(Players may not take score chips from the lower-ranked players to boost their lacking scores.) For more details on how to play, please click here.      LEXIO Plus chip set consists of 2 luxurious chip cases and 6 different kinds of chips(20 pieces per color) – 1pt, 2pt, 5pt, 10pt, 50pt, 100pt. These colorful chips are made with iron inside, using the same materials as common casino chips but in a smaller size of 30mm in diameter.

<p>Welcome one and all to a new and different type of vertical tabletop party game! Incredibly simple to play, yet it's the type of game that will possibly cause you to get embarrassed, it will reveal harsh truths about the way you think, and it will push the boundaries of your friendships! In order to defeat Satan and all opponents, you will have to say things and do tasks that will showcase how badly you want to win at the expense of others!</p>
<p>The game's premise very is simple - each player takes turns spinning the Demonic Spinner. Each player must do what the final space under the pointer instructs. Depending on if the dictated task is done or not, players gain or lose 'Soul Bars'. The last player to have at least one Soul Bar in his/her possession is the winner.</p>

<p><strong>Do As Satan Says</strong> is a completely assembled vertical tabletop game handmade out of layered heavy-gauge corrugated cardboard, and wood for the spinner. The 'Demonic Spinner' in the middle of the structure has ten selections that instruct players to do specific tasks. A breakdown of each part of the spinner is below in the next heading 'DEMONIC SPINNER'.</p>
<h3>
<strong>The game has a height of 32"" by 16"" wide.</strong> <u><strong>IT IS A TALL GAME!</strong></u> It comes fully assembled and ready for immediate play.</h3>
<p>All components of the game, from the cardboard to final construction, are <strong>made in North America!</strong> Not a single part of this game is made overseas. The cardboard is made in The United States and the assembly is done in Canada.</p>

<p>Each player received 6 <strong>Soul Bars</strong> to begin the game. The standard game package comes with 24 Soul Bars for a 4-player tournament. The entire purpose of the game is to make opponents lose their Soul Bars. Most of the time, Soul Bars are lost when a player fails to complete a spinner or card task. However, there are options to punish other players as well.  Once one player is left with at least a single Soul Bar, that player is the winner.</p>

<p>There are only 3 card categories in the game:</p>
<p><strong>1) Torture Test </strong>- a player must do a physical feat that must be completed within a specific time period, or lose a soul bar. The tests can be anything from floor planks to balancing on one foot. There are also odd random tortures like '<i>having an opponent with the worst singing voice sing any song they want in your ear</i>' or '<i>smell the socks of an opponent, to be chosen by all opponents</i>'. Yeah, it gets gross and stressful - the devil has a sick sense of humor!</p>
<p><strong>2) The Unpleasant Act</strong> - Simple and straight to the point! Each card has one set of instructions and a player must do as it says. The instructions can ask anything. Nothing that will kill or hurt you, but in order to keep that Soul Bar, things will get embarrassing.</p>
<p><strong>3) The Unpleasant Truth</strong> - These cards will really push the boundaries of your friendships and family relationships! Each card gives a horrific situation and a player must admit who will live or die in those hypothetical situations. No holding back - in order to keep that Soul Bar, the truth must be said aloud for all to hear! </p>
<p>Each of the 3 card decks also contains random cards that can protect players from unwanted cards, immediately take a Soul Bar, or force Soul Bars from other players. Be wary of the Death Reaper card or Archangel HappyFace!</p>

<p><strong>Do As Satan Says</strong> is meant to be a fun, yet revealing, party game meant to push players to their honest limits.

<p>The goal is to raise $666 or more. <strong>Understand that this campaign is not like most crowdfunding campaigns and does not require a large financial amount to mass-produce a product.</strong> Because <i>Do As Satan Says</i> is made 100% in-house, if only 5 people back this campaign, we can <strong>guarantee</strong> you'll get your game! Indiegogo is the perfect option to determine how many copies to make and then ship out all at the same time.</p>

DEMONIC SPINNER TABLETOP PARTY GAME
THIS IS NOT A GAME FOR ANYONE UNDER 18 YEARS OF AGE!!!
66 HANDMADE COPIES AVAILABLE EXCLUSIVELY ON INDIEGOGO FOR 2020!!!

 
SUMMARY

Welcome one and all to a new and different type of vertical tabletop party game! Incredibly simple to play, yet it's the type of game that will possibly cause you to get embarrassed, it will reveal harsh truths about the way you think, and it will push the boundaries of your friendships! In order to defeat Satan and all opponents, you will have to say things and do tasks that will showcase how badly you want to win at the expense of others!
The game's premise very is simple - each player takes turns spinning the Demonic Spinner. Each player must do what the final space under the pointer instructs. Depending on if the dictated task is done or not, players gain or lose 'Soul Bars'. The last player to have at least one Soul Bar in his/her possession is the winner.

 
THE DESIGN



Do As Satan Says is a completely assembled vertical tabletop game handmade out of layered heavy-gauge corrugated cardboard, and wood for the spinner. The 'Demonic Spinner' in the middle of the structure has ten selections that instruct players to do specific tasks. A breakdown of each part of the spinner is below in the next heading 'DEMONIC SPINNER'.

The game has a height of 32"" by 16"" wide. IT IS A TALL GAME! It comes fully assembled and ready for immediate play.
All components of the game, from the cardboard to final construction, are made in North America! Not a single part of this game is made overseas. The cardboard is made in The United States and the assembly is done in Canada.

 
THE SOUL BARS


Each player received 6 Soul Bars to begin the game. The standard game package comes with 24 Soul Bars for a 4-player tournament. The entire purpose of the game is to make opponents lose their Soul Bars. Most of the time, Soul Bars are lost when a player fails to complete a spinner or card task. However, there are options to punish other players as well.  Once one player is left with at least a single Soul Bar, that player is the winner.
 
THE GAME CARDS


There are only 3 card categories in the game:
1) Torture Test - a player must do a physical feat that must be completed within a specific time period, or lose a soul bar. The tests can be anything from floor planks to balancing on one foot. There are also odd random tortures like 'having an opponent with the worst singing voice sing any song they want in your ear' or 'smell the socks of an opponent, to be chosen by all opponents'. Yeah, it gets gross and stressful - the devil has a sick sense of humor!
2) The Unpleasant Act - Simple and straight to the point! Each card has one set of instructions and a player must do as it says. The instructions can ask anything. Nothing that will kill or hurt you, but in order to keep that Soul Bar, things will get embarrassing.
3) The Unpleasant Truth - These cards will really push the boundaries of your friendships and family relationships! Each card gives a horrific situation and a player must admit who will live or die in those hypothetical situations. No holding back - in order to keep that Soul Bar, the truth must be said aloud for all to hear! 
Each of the 3 card decks also contains random cards that can protect players from unwanted cards, immediately take a Soul Bar, or force Soul Bars from other players. Be wary of the Death Reaper card or Archangel HappyFace!

 
THE DEMONIC SPINNER

Instead of a game board and dice to determine game progression and movement, each player simply spins the Demonic Spinner and Satan will tell you what you need to do!

The Demonic Spinner Sections are (from top section going clockwise):
1) Unpleasant Truth - take a card from that deck.
2) Torture Test - take a card from that deck.
3) Give into Drink - a player must take a shot of any drink he/she can't stand (doesn't have to be alcohol).
4) Beg for Your Forgiveness - a player must beg for mercy to keep his/her souls.
5) Give into Puff Puff - (only for those who smoke) - a player must take the biggest inhale he/she can (if they smoke - alternative actions will be listed in the manual for this specific space).
6) Unpleasant Act - take a card from that deck.
7) Punish Another - force any opponent to take a card from any of the 3 card decks.
8) Thy Must Belch or Fart of Pure Death - as gross as it sounds, simply to stay in the game, a player must be able to burp or fart on cue.
9) Safe Under the One Above All - there is some good in this game! A player gets to do nothing and lose nothing. 
10) One Soul Lost - #9 might have been a safe space, but Satan doesn't like it! So in this space, a Soul Bar is lost immediately!

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">SIMPLICITY/DEPTH</h2>
<p><br/>Soul Shard is your game for simple and easy settings/rules, which allows for depth of strategy. This is one of the most powerful features. During our tests, inexperienced players often mentioned something along the lines of this: “This game is perfect if you don’t know how to play or how to start playing Role-Playing games”. While role-playing game veterans (like ourselves) thoroughly enjoy the freedom of strategy. That was one of our priorities. Keep it simple, keep it deep.</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u>NON-REPETITIVE</u></h2>
<p> </p>
<p><br/>Soul Shard has dynamic map system which prevents the game from repeating itself. Besides that, Soul Shard currently has several years of playtime built into a scenario database so be ready for an endless adventure! Also we are publishing monthly print &amp; play mini scenarios via our web page!</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u>UNIQUE SKILLS/ITEMS</u></h2>
<p>In Soul Shard, you can build up your own unique ability tree. You don’t have to get stuck on mono-type class build or skills. One mage may want to focus on area of effect damage, while another may want single target burst mage, why limit them? Play as you like. You can also obtain unique item sets and legendary sets. When you complete item sets, you will have additional bonuses. For the first game, our main slots are “Head, Shoulder, Gloves, Belt, Pants and Weapons” Quests and enemies will score you better and better loot!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u>INFINITE ROLE-PLAY</u></h2>
<p>Besides killing anyone in your path, you can even finish the game just by Role-Playing! In every<br/>town and city you will meet with new folk, they can be nice, if you know how to approach them.<br/>Every essential Non-Player Character has its own character card complete with stats and<br/>characteristics.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u>Narrator System</u></h2>
<p>As you all know, in Role-Playing games players will be in need of a DM (Dungeon Master). We,<br/>instead, have the Narrator. She/he will be part of the game as well. the Narrator has its own rules to play by, which means he/she cannot give you godly rewards or punishments. Instead, we have narrator cards and in order to obtain Narrator cards, players need to make progress in game. Then the Narrator can use those cards such as to give you extra loot or cast a lightning bolt on a single target (whomever he/she desires) in a battleground. Everything that yields experience to the players, gives Narrator points to the Narrator.</p>

<p>    Although this is our first project, we have spent most of our lives preparing for it. As gamers<br/>we recognize an excellent game when we see one; we’ve spent the time playing, creating, and<br/>guiding people through our scenarios. In fact, these are some of our fondest memories. Now we are using the knowledge we have gained throughout the years to make Soul Shard into an adventure you can literally partake in for a lifetime.</p>
<p><br/>  Of course there was and there still is a lot to learn. When we first started we knew we had to<br/>learn about the business side of things. Before we made any kind of deal with printing or distribution companies we tracked down and talked to their references. This was in order to make sure everyone would be receiving best and fastest quality of services. Our job and passion will not stop with the first edition of Soul Shard. There will be monthly updates in the form of print and play. There will be also future expansions to add new game pieces and mechanics. We’ve poured everything into our project and company. We see no option for failure, only growth.</p>
<p><br/>We know there will be obstacles ahead, and there is one thing I know every person at this<br/>company shares - grit. We see any project through no matter the obstacle. Believe me we have already seen our fair share. Study, diligence, long hours, and a lot of coffee has gotten this far. Now we are asking for your help to bring this game to fruition. After hundreds of tests of our prototype we have received overwhelmingly positive reactions. This was a huge success and motivator to distribute Soul Shard internationally. Please contact us with any feedback or questions. Safety on your journey travelers, and may you always be blessed with epic loot!</p>

Soul Shard has dynamic map system which prevents the game from repeating itself. Besides that, Soul Shard currently has several years of playtime built into a scenario database so be ready for an endless adventure! Also we are publishing monthly print & play mini scenarios via our web page!
UNIQUE SKILLS/ITEMS
In Soul Shard, you can build up your own unique ability tree. You don’t have to get stuck on mono-type class build or skills. One mage may want to focus on area of effect damage, while another may want single target burst mage, why limit them? Play as you like. You can also obtain unique item sets and legendary sets. When you complete item sets, you will have additional bonuses. For the first game, our main slots are “Head, Shoulder, Gloves, Belt, Pants and Weapons” Quests and enemies will score you better and better loot!
 
INFINITE ROLE-PLAY
Besides killing anyone in your path, you can even finish the game just by Role-Playing! In everytown and city you will meet with new folk, they can be nice, if you know how to approach them.Every essential Non-Player Character has its own character card complete with stats andcharacteristics.
 
Narrator System
As you all know, in Role-Playing games players will be in need of a DM (Dungeon Master). We,instead, have the Narrator. She/he will be part of the game as well. the Narrator has its own rules to play by, which means he/she cannot give you godly rewards or punishments. Instead, we have narrator cards and in order to obtain Narrator cards, players need to make progress in game. Then the Narrator can use those cards such as to give you extra loot or cast a lightning bolt on a single target (whomever he/she desires) in a battleground. Everything that yields experience to the players, gives Narrator points to the Narrator.


    Although this is our first project, we have spent most of our lives preparing for it. As gamerswe recognize an excellent game when we see one; we’ve spent the time playing, creating, andguiding people through our scenarios. In fact, these are some of our fondest memories. Now we are using the knowledge we have gained throughout the years to make Soul Shard into an adventure you can literally partake in for a lifetime.
  Of course there was and there still is a lot to learn. When we first started we knew we had tolearn about the business side of things. Before we made any kind of deal with printing or distribution companies we tracked down and talked to their references. This was in order to make sure everyone would be receiving best and fastest quality of services. Our job and passion will not stop with the first edition of Soul Shard. There will be monthly updates in the form of print and play. There will be also future expansions to add new game pieces and mechanics. We’ve poured everything into our project and company. We see no option for failure, only growth.
We know there will be obstacles ahead, and there is one thing I know every person at thiscompany shares - grit. We see any project through no matter the obstacle. Believe me we have already seen our fair share. Study, diligence, long hours, and a lot of coffee has gotten this far. Now we are asking for your help to bring this game to fruition. After hundreds of tests of our prototype we have received overwhelmingly positive reactions. This was a huge success and motivator to distribute Soul Shard internationally. Please contact us with any feedback or questions. Safety on your journey travelers, and may you always be blessed with epic loot!

Since our prototype is on process right now, we decided to put a few feedbacks from our testplayers. We will put review videos here asap.

""-Hey guys, first of all i'd like to thank you for letting us play this game. The game was simple when we compare it to other board games. It was different because there was no need for gm(which is hard to find). It was a whole different experience. Cards were designed so perfect that there was no balance issues in the combat. We are looking forward to play it again when it's available to buy. We are glad to be the first members of this community.""
""-Boss battle system was kickass every monster has it own skills and phase, you gotta be realy careful to defeat them also some AoE spells can hurt your teammates R.I.P our fallen warrior. :sob:""
""-Hello Guys, Thanks for letting us play Soul Shard game within the convention.My first impression about the game is;
It was like playing my favorite mmorpg game as a tabletop. It was such a nice experience for me. Simple, funny, dangerous and fluent. Personally i enjoyed a lot, wishing you best on your future plans! 
Gladly;

<h3>STI Wars</h3>
<p><strong>About our project</strong></p>
<p>Sex education is a vital weapon in the fight against STIs – and STI Wars is a brand new and exciting way to get young people talking about Sexually Transmitted Infections. We’ve developed a fun, memorable game experience which helps young people explore how to avoid risks and prevent STIs, in way that allows open, pressure-free conversations.</p>
<p><strong>Project Aims</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Create a fun, non-patronising, age appropriate game that gives young people a chance to talk about sexual health issues.</li>
<li>Aimed at 13- 18 year olds</li>
<li>Embed the educational content within the gameplay – the game is the central educational activity, not an 'ice breaker'.</li>
<li>Help remove taboos around discussing STIs and sexual health, allowing players to talk openly without feeling embarrassed, awkward or under pressure.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why a sex education game?</strong></p>
<p>200,000 new cases of STIs were diagnosed in England alone in 2015. Sex and relationship education clearly isn’t helping young people stay safe and to avoid STIs. The sexual health time bomb is ticking and we want to help defuse it – so we’ve created STI Wars to help make sex education useful, effective and engaging.</p>

<p><strong>Original idea for STI Wars</strong></p>
<p>Aida de Heras who was a student at Edinburgh University came up with the idea :</p>
<p>“<i>Taboos are not helpful - they only contribute to creating and perpetrating unnecessary myths.</i> <i>Obviously sexual health is one of those topics, and should be approached at an early age for teenagers to be well equipped and know what their options are, and what they may be exposing themselves to. </i></p>
<p><i>When I started studying my MSc in Science Communication and Public Engagement in 2016, the idea of play as a learning tool became more and more interesting. I am someone who learns by doing and I am also a huge fan of being silly and having a good laugh. I think that ‘fun’ experiences can be particularly memorable, and games are great at generating those. I decided then that I wanted to make a game which creates an atmosphere where there is no pressure, no judgement and is a safe space to openly explore the subject of STIs.”</i></p>

<p><strong><strong>Spotted was developed for people ages <strong>6-14 and up! </strong></strong></strong>And we want to emphasize the “and up” part because it’s more fun if the whole family joins in!

<p><strong><strong>When the game begins, a <strong>Council</strong> must be formed by the player(s) and anybody else in the car that wants to help the player(s).</strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>The Council’s mission is to solve any confusion or ambiguity </strong>that appears or comes along in the game. For example, let’s say the player has the token “puddle” on the pad, and he sees outside something that resembles more to a mini-lake. Does that count as a puddle? Well, the Council has to vote and decide if it is OK or not. And just like that, we used this rule as an opportunity for the kids to bond with the parents.</p>

<p>Hi! We’re Mihaela and Adrian and we’re the creators of Spotted! We’re inspired and propelled by education. Over the years, we’ve learned that we are what we read, study, watch, eat, listen, play, and these aspects are extremely important in shaping the character of the little ones.</p>
<p>In our work with children, we’ve learned that big things are actually built out of many small things, and that character is sedimented bit by bit! That’s the reason we want to create games that leave a positive mark in children’s development.</p>

<h3><strong><strong>Thanks for stopping by and checking out our project! We hope to have you on board soon! :)</strong></strong></h3>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<h3><strong><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></strong></h3>
<p>We’ve built many prototypes of Spotted, and the production of the game is pretty simple – so is building the box and packaging the game! We have a great relationship with the factory and don’t foresee any obstacles regarding the making of the game.</p>
<p>A challenge will be to deliver the game to people who pledge from all over the world, but we have worked out the logistics carefully to avoid unexpected surprised and ensure a quick and safe delivery, and we will start the production process as soon as the campaign ends. Would any problems arise despite our planning, we will, be upfront about them and make sure to communicate any updates with our community.</p>

Spotted was developed for people ages 6-14 and up! And we want to emphasize the “and up” part because it’s more fun if the whole family joins in! Spotted comes with two wooden boards but the rest of the family in the car, bus or train can take part too.

When the game begins, a Council must be formed by the player(s) and anybody else in the car that wants to help the player(s).
The Council’s mission is to solve any confusion or ambiguity that appears or comes along in the game. For example, let’s say the player has the token “puddle” on the pad, and he sees outside something that resembles more to a mini-lake. Does that count as a puddle? Well, the Council has to vote and decide if it is OK or not. And just like that, we used this rule as an opportunity for the kids to bond with the parents.


Hi! We’re Mihaela and Adrian and we’re the creators of Spotted! We’re inspired and propelled by education. Over the years, we’ve learned that we are what we read, study, watch, eat, listen, play, and these aspects are extremely important in shaping the character of the little ones.
In our work with children, we’ve learned that big things are actually built out of many small things, and that character is sedimented bit by bit! That’s the reason we want to create games that leave a positive mark in children’s development.

Andrei Ursachi is a Serial Entrepreneur and a Digital Marketer. He will take care of Barking Lab, the company behind Spotted. Andrei will ensure the profitability of the company activities to drive sustainable development and long-term success.

Risks & Challenges
We’ve built many prototypes of Spotted, and the production of the game is pretty simple – so is building the box and packaging the game! We have a great relationship with the factory and don’t foresee any obstacles regarding the making of the game.
A challenge will be to deliver the game to people who pledge from all over the world, but we have worked out the logistics carefully to avoid unexpected surprised and ensure a quick and safe delivery, and we will start the production process as soon as the campaign ends. Would any problems arise despite our planning, we will, be upfront about them and make sure to communicate any updates with our community.",30.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3 style=""text-decoration: underline;"">The Vision</h3>
<p>Experience the belly-busting laughter game! Connect with your favorite people! Unleash the actor within and discover a side of yourself that you didn’t even know you had!</p>
<p><strong>Improv Against Normality</strong> (patent pending) was created by actor-improviser, Julie Cotton, with an intent to connect the world through laughter and play. Break out of what's ""normal"" and be a part of creating the extraordinary!</p>
<p>Contributions to our campaign will support a world where <i>Connection, Creativity, Play, and Laughter</i> are celebrated and championed!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-decoration: underline;"">The story of the Game</h3>
<p>The maker of the game asked two questions - <i>""How can I make Improv a household name?"" </i></p>
<p>And, when working with groups or corporate teams, <i>""How can I leave something behind that will allow people to continue to practice the culture of Improv after our workshop/event is over?""</i></p>
<p><strong>Improv Against Normality</strong> was the answer that came through in a mediation late November 2018. It felt like a calling to steward these cards into ""being"". Since then, it's been a flurry of momentum creating a prototype, touring the nation for market research and for playability while now shifting into capital raising in order to make the cards a reality for the world!</p>
<p>The <u>goal</u> is to bring a simple and basic version of Improv to as many people as possible.</p>
<p>These cards are made up of 5 color decks Black, Blue, Green, Yellow and White with 101 cards in each deck, 505 total (why not 100/500? Why be normal?) </p>
<ul>
<li>Black - Scenario Card</li>
<li>Blue- Character Card</li>
<li>Green- Location Card</li>
<li>Yellow- Object/Activity Card</li>
<li>White- Secret/Want Card</li>
</ul>
<p>Start with a Scenario, then add in the 4 most common pillars to a good scene - <i>The WHO, the WHAT, the WHERE and the WHY</i>. And see what you and your favorite people can bring to life through live action role play.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-decoration: underline;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>All funds raised will go directly to the printing, design, and production of <strong>Improv Against Normality </strong>Cards themselves. We are keeping commerce in America and printing with a company based in Battlecreek, Michigan. The amount of funding raised will determine the number of cards we can print.</li>
<li>Exciting future-pacing- we have a video-capable app version of the game in the works which would allow people to play from anywhere in the world (and save some trees)! Design and development costs for the app are upwards of $15K on top of our initial printing costs.</li>
<li>In the event that we do not reach our collective funding goal, all funds will still go towards the printing and fulfillment of the cards for those who contributed. The shipping date would simply push back until we are able, as a company, to generate the necessary funds.</li>

<h3 style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p><strong>Next Level Improv</strong> strives to deliver quality products and services with quick turn around.</p>
<p>One challenge we foresee in this endeavor is having so much support that we exceed our man-power capacity to deliver interactive responses, engage as fully with our contributors as we would like throughout the campaign, and/or delay printing/shipping of games due to exceedingly high volumes. Potential solution(s)- attract volunteer support, interns, new teammates to support the execution of these tasks.</p>
<p>Another risk could be not reaching our funding goal and needing to delay production of the games and t-shirts beyond the May 2019 projection potentially disappointing our supporters. Potential solution- seek outside funding options- increasing in-person pre-sale events, trade shows, investors, angel investors, loans etc.</p>

<p>Hi, <a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/101120/kenechukwu-ogbuagu"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">m</a><a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/101120/kenechukwu-ogbuagu"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">y name is KC</a><a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/101120/kenechukwu-ogbuagu"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">;</a> I am the founder of <a href=""https://nibcardgames.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">NIBCARD Games</a> - a publishing, manufacturing and promotional tabletop games company in Nigeria, Africa.  With the help of my team, we have designed and published 17 boardgames, hosted the <a href=""https://www.dailytrust.com.ng/african-boardgame-convention-introduces-award-for-3rd-edition.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">first Boardgame convention in Nigeria </a>(annually since 2016), opened the <a href=""https://leadership.ng/2019/03/16/group-launches-nigerias-first-boardgame-cafe/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">first Boardgame cafe in Nigeria </a>and introduced the world of boardgaming to over 15,000 Nigerians directly and more indirectly.</p>
<p>I invite you to back our boardgame project. But before I tell you why, please meet WAN WAN TOUCH: The boardgame. </p>
<p><strong>Wan Wan Touch</strong> is a dexterity soccer game from Nigeria. The game is a version of a popular street soccer game where players can only touch/play the ball once. It can be played by <strong>2-4 players</strong> and takes between <strong>30-60 minutes</strong> to play and is suitable for anyone from the age of <strong>7 years and above.</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1565205436/cxrotzwywcjf4vuw2psd.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The game idea came up during a boardgame hangout we hosted. One of the players jokingly talked about the football game we usually played on the street when we were still younger and players had to only touch/play the ball once until someone else have done the same.</p>
<p>The journey of developing this game has truly been worth it. The process has brought back a lot of feelings from the past - memories I thought were forgotten. Also, this game has been a force for better design and production from everyone in the team. </p>
<p>This is also our first 3D boardgame. And we are really excited about it. Really excited.</p>

<h3>Why Back Us?</h3>
<p>Reaching our goal will be a huge WIN for us and the Tabletop Gaming community because it will help increase our everyday activities to see a growing interest in the hobby accross Nigeria and hopefully other African countries. Imagine the many joy that boardgames could bring to homes, the smiles, the memories and the relationships it could established (see our daily activities on our <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/nibcardgames/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Instagram</a> handle)</p>
<p>We are asking you to back us so that we can continue what we are doing and even better! As well as send you our Nigerian and African experience on a board!<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1565349647/wirlt8i1jbn8jt3gw8cf.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Funds from this campaign will help us bring in more competent and motivated people to help us reach more people in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Nigeria </a>- a country of over 200 million people (in fact, the largest black country in the World). To have better equipment and software, to make better art works and to see our games globally accepted - perhaps win the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiel_des_Jahres"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Spiel des  Jahres</a>, <a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/BoardGameGeek_Golden_Geek"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Boardgame Geek</a> and/or <a href=""https://www.dicetower.com/content/dice-tower-awards"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dice Tower</a> awards.</p>
<h3>But this can only become achievable if we reach our goal of producing and shipping <strong>at least 1,321 copies</strong> of Wan Wan Touch boardgame at the current perk ($40).</h3>
</div><div>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, we will get the products and/or service we need the most (and able to afford). However, we are not stopping. We take solace in knowing that there was once a time when we thought about setting up the first Tabletop Games Cafe in Nigeria and the Global gaming community (YOU) believed and backed us. We are not resting until we see an active gaming community that involves every household in Nigeria. Boardgames are too amazing not to be in homes and played.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Extra Reward</strong></h3>
<p>For every backer, we will play a game with anyone (<a href=""https://nibcardgames.com/nibcard-games-cafe/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">in the cafe</a> or outside the cafe)  in honour of you. We will of course post an evidence such as pictures, quotes or videos. The boardgame community have taught us how priceless it is to introduce new people to the hobby. So yes, we will be doing this in your honour.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>This will be our biggest project. And it will create our most impact yet. Having a full active structure will give us the leverage to focus on supporting game lovers and designers to work on their ideas and to try out new ideas ourselves. This will increase ownership from different 'independent' individuals and/or groups who will in turn promote their own games and the entire boardgaming industry in Nigeria.</p>
<p>Also, it will help create sustained employment opportunities for people (<a href=""https://tradingeconomics.com/nigeria/youth-unemployment-rate"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Youth Unemployment Rate in Nigeria averaged 23.63 percent from 2014 until 2018, reaching an all time high of 38 percent in the second quarter of 2018 and a record low of 11.70 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014.</a>). I strongly believe the Tabletop Gaming Hobby has the potential to create value chains of work.</p>

</div></div>","Welcome to our Page!
Hi, my name is KC; I am the founder of NIBCARD Games - a publishing, manufacturing and promotional tabletop games company in Nigeria, Africa.  With the help of my team, we have designed and published 17 boardgames, hosted the first Boardgame convention in Nigeria (annually since 2016), opened the first Boardgame cafe in Nigeria and introduced the world of boardgaming to over 15,000 Nigerians directly and more indirectly.
I invite you to back our boardgame project. But before I tell you why, please meet WAN WAN TOUCH: The boardgame. 
Wan Wan Touch is a dexterity soccer game from Nigeria. The game is a version of a popular street soccer game where players can only touch/play the ball once. It can be played by 2-4 players and takes between 30-60 minutes to play and is suitable for anyone from the age of 7 years and above.

 
The game idea came up during a boardgame hangout we hosted. One of the players jokingly talked about the football game we usually played on the street when we were still younger and players had to only touch/play the ball once until someone else have done the same.
The journey of developing this game has truly been worth it. The process has brought back a lot of feelings from the past - memories I thought were forgotten. Also, this game has been a force for better design and production from everyone in the team. 
This is also our first 3D boardgame. And we are really excited about it. Really excited.

This will be our biggest project. And it will create our most impact yet.

I strongly believe the Tabletop Gaming Hobby has the potential to create value chains of work.


In the past, I believed I could design a game back in 2013 at a time when everyone around me said it has never been done and could't be done. We have gone on to publish 18 of them (this will be our 19th and also working with 3 different individuals to release their own games). See current video of our activities from 2017.

In 2016, we started the African Boardgame Convention (AB Con) in Nigeria when none was existing and we were told it couldn't be done. We also introduced a yearly Award to recognize and honour everyone who is supporting the growth of the industry in Nigeria.

We also crowdfunded to start a boardgame cafe in Nigeria even when I was told it couldn't be done.

Embark on exciting quests, training dragons and attempting to save Earth.  Dragons of Afterlands will take you to an exciting world where you will encounter dragons and other magical creatures in your quest to find legendary Dragon Eggs, restore harmony to Earth and save humanity.Witness the board come to life through the use of Augmented Reality (AR) on your phone or tablet as you progress along intricately decorated realms, interact with the environments, vanquish monsters and cooperate and compete with other players to progress through the game.  The result is a fantastic blend of traditional board game dynamics with an exciting digital world that will plunge you deep into a universe of suspended belief where reality and fiction blur. Vanquish the monsters, avoid deadly natural disasters and skilfully travel between realms to help the Dragon Witch and save the world!               With the world devastated by the climate crisis, humans live in the central neutral territory, with the rest of the world uninhabitable, struggling to survive in their limited territory. They are visited by a Dragon Witch, who promises brave adventurers exciting rewards and the power to restore harmony to Earth who help her raise her dragons. Adventurers must travel to the Dragon Realms to achieve their mission by completing storytelling challenges to win Dragon Eggs and help humanity survive. Guided by the avatar Dragon Witch, players use storytelling and roleplay to collaborate and compete to complete the challenges. These challenges help players develop communication and wellbeing skills associated with improving mental health. The first player to complete their Egg Mission, build wellbeing energy and make it back to the start wins!                                         This is a 2-8 player game that offers a unique hybrid gameplay experience, combining physical elements such as the board, dice, cards and player tokens with virtual components that track player progress and bring life to the story and characters thanks to the versatility of technology.

It could also be described as a tabletop escape room where the puzzle is not the room you find yourself trapped in but rather the people sharing the room with you, each of them a secret character as unique as yourself.</p><p>The game begins with the players waking to discover they have been abducted and imprisoned in an empty room, virtually exitless except for a trapdoor in the center of the floor with the words ""Feed Me"" scrawled upon it. A malevolent voice from an indeterminable source soon instructs the players that they must select one among themselves to be sacrificed in order for the others to be set free. A hidden timer begins counting down, and if the group can not reach an agreement before it expires, gas will flood the room, killing them all.</p><p>At its core, All or One is a game of conversation and compromise. The puzzle presented to the players lies hidden in the role cards, each a unique character with their own thematic motivations and goals; as players work toward meeting their own victory conditions, they begin to share information, both through their choices of action and verbally, whether speaking honestly or otherwise, and a picture of potential outcomes begins to form. Players can strike bargains, make alliances, protect each other, betray each other, discover and reveal information about one another; steal, injure, intimidate, coerce, possibly kill; or perhaps assist, encourage, confide, maybe even discover a means of escape; or maybe just simply gang up on one poor soul if the majority so desires. Through purposefully freeform, emergent group dynamics, no two games of All or One will ever play out the same.</p><p>How far will you go to ensure you get out alive... if that's even the personal end goal you are trying to achieve.</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/UAn6Iw18gRU?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><div> </div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508150754/rtvlfvrphfxnkjumotcf.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h2>What are these add-on packs?</h2><p>During our Kickstarter campaign, we offered two separate expanded content packs as add-ons.</p><p>The Community Content Pack is a Limited Edition pack, which will consist of five unique characters and five unique special items submitted by select Kickstarter backers.

Whether before or after reading this section, we strongly suggest you watch either the How to Play video tutorial or the <a href=""https://live.kickstarter.com/robot-high-five/live-stream/pax-west-live-play-demo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">PAX West Demo</a> which includes rules being explained to a live group who then are able to play out and enjoy their first game.</p><p><i>Please Note: All samples shown are prototype placeholder art and will be replaced with final art; the style and layout are also subject to change.</i></p><p>First, a set of ""Potential Role"" cards are dealt face up in the center of the table. These represent potential characters that any given player might hold and which would be in play within the room. The players themselves are only a subset of these potential roles.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508154334/lscl746wy9x2fujka6xv.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>These are just a small sample of the Potential Role cards. As you can see, they display a character name and two icons; the icon on the upper left offers a hint at what that character's main victory condition or goal is, and the icon on the upper right offers a hint at that character's bonus score roll conditions -- what this means is at the end of the game, any players who have achieved their victory condition <i>and then</i> also fulfilled bonus roll conditions, get to roll a number of dice to score themselves; the player with the highest score is considered the true winner of the game.</p><p>This becomes more clear when you see the ""Hidden Role"" cards. Each player will receive two of these, allowing them to choose which role to play; some roles are much more challenging to play than others.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508154404/ai1s7dtuuwg8zg118sxw.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>As you can see viewing the sample hidden role cards, they offer much more depth about the character, the victory condition, and the bonus roll objectives.</p><p>The players are also each dealt two ""Special Item"" cards from which they can choose one to bring into the room with them; typically they would want to choose one which compliments their selected character, provided they've been fortunate enough to have been dealt one.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508154464/bu1zuk5sazz9xd1psqsy.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>The special items aim to be self explanatory and most are allowed to be willingly shared without requiring use. During the game, players can reveal, activate, trade, and/or steal items.</p><p>Finally, each player also receives one ""Mark"" card, which designates a player seated one or two seats to the left or right, but should not be interpreted as that player must die. The mark is only contextually relevant if the player's selected role or item card use the word Mark; if neither card says Mark, the mark card is meaningless, but all players must hold one.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508154523/ma34pfyptyqjvdumh8oa.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>As can be seen in the case of the Protector, the player seated two the left must actually be protected and survive in order for this player to win the game.</p><p>In addition to these hidden cards, players will each have access to Action Reference cards. These cards are color coded to match mental states which players will be increasing throughout the game: green is for Trust based actions, and red is for Aggression based actions. The actions are tiered, requiring increasing the given state to the level designated in order to unlock a specific action.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508154567/ngpyd4zelmebyjd2cn4g.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>The game is split into and could last up to six rounds -- provided the players don't make choices or take actions which could end it earlier. At the beginning of the game and in between each round the players receive one double-sided mental state token; everyone privately chooses which mental state to increase, reveals simultaneously, and the next round immediately begins. The tokens are not currency that is spent to attempt actions, rather they simply designate the level of each player's respective mental states and which state specific actions are available for that player to use. Each player is allowed one trust based action and one aggression based action per round; any actions not listed on the card are considered free actions and players may attempt as many of those as they wish.</p><p>Whenever a player attempts an action against another player who does not want that action to be successful, they each roll a six-sided action die against each other: highest roll wins, any ties go to a defending player.</p><p>The game ends in one of three ways: If a body is on the trap door -- quick reminder that the players are all trapped together in an exitless room except for a trap door in the center of the floor -- the moderator (or a player acting as moderator) will ask, ""Do all players who are able to speak agree to this sacrifice?"" If the answer is a unanimous ""Yes"" then the trap door opens and the game immediately ends; if any player answers ""No"" the game continues. If the game timer expires on the last and final round, gas floods the room killing everyone inside and ending the game.

It could also be described as a tabletop escape room where the puzzle is not the room you find yourself trapped in but rather the people sharing the room with you, each of them a secret character as unique as yourself.The game begins with the players waking to discover they have been abducted and imprisoned in an empty room, virtually exitless except for a trapdoor in the center of the floor with the words ""Feed Me"" scrawled upon it. A malevolent voice from an indeterminable source soon instructs the players that they must select one among themselves to be sacrificed in order for the others to be set free. A hidden timer begins counting down, and if the group can not reach an agreement before it expires, gas will flood the room, killing them all.At its core, All or One is a game of conversation and compromise. The puzzle presented to the players lies hidden in the role cards, each a unique character with their own thematic motivations and goals; as players work toward meeting their own victory conditions, they begin to share information, both through their choices of action and verbally, whether speaking honestly or otherwise, and a picture of potential outcomes begins to form. Players can strike bargains, make alliances, protect each other, betray each other, discover and reveal information about one another; steal, injure, intimidate, coerce, possibly kill; or perhaps assist, encourage, confide, maybe even discover a means of escape; or maybe just simply gang up on one poor soul if the majority so desires. Through purposefully freeform, emergent group dynamics, no two games of All or One will ever play out the same.How far will you go to ensure you get out alive... if that's even the personal end goal you are trying to achieve.  What are these add-on packs?During our Kickstarter campaign, we offered two separate expanded content packs as add-ons.The Community Content Pack is a Limited Edition pack, which will consist of five unique characters and five unique special items submitted by select Kickstarter backers. As submissions are still works in progress, we do not have character or item details to share at this time; however, rest assured that any and all submissions will be properly integrated into the existing game. Due to the limited nature of this pack, we may choose to cut off all Perks which contain this add-on at any time.The Cat Pack is a Special Edition pack, which will consist of five unique characters based on the purrsonalities and likenesses of our own five cats. We hosted a ""Meet Our Cats"" live stream during our Kickstarter campaign, you can find the archived links in the collected videos section further down. As this pack is special edition, it will not be limited in any way.As can be seen, as long as the limited CCP remains available, you can choose to add on both packs for a discounted price! Also, please note, the add-on packs will not increase your shipping charge above the flat rate for the base game (as detailed in the shipping section further down).SPECIAL NOTE: For any Kickstarter backers who missed out on the add-on packs during the campaign and have come to this page specifically to pre-order them, a special backers-only update on Kickstarter will detail how to get the packs without the base game attached.  Final Character Art Sample:Our final art is not yet completed because we are in the midst of using select Kickstarter backers to literally model for our character art. Shown here is a sample of what that means and the style Sarah will be applying as the character artist: Image has been compressed to meet site upload requirements.Here's a static look at the potential and hidden cards for the mock Witch role. Because this character has not been included in the current iteration of the prototype, the icons and wording are loosely used just for example purposes; however, this character will be refined and included in the final production copy of the game. Base Game Components:
Two piece game box 
One deck of 21 potential character cards 
One deck of 21 hidden character cards 
One deck of 20 special item cards 
One deck of 12 mark cards 
One set of action reference cards  
Five 6-sided action dice
60 double-sided tokens
One instruction booklet 
 How to Play:For those already familiar with the game, or those who simply prefer information presented through video, feel free to skip ahead to the collected campaign videos and live streams presented in the next section.Provided here is brief description of how to play along with some card samples. Whether before or after reading this section, we strongly suggest you watch either the How to Play video tutorial or the PAX West Demo which includes rules being explained to a live group who then are able to play out and enjoy their first game.Please Note: All samples shown are prototype placeholder art and will be replaced with final art; the style and layout are also subject to change.First, a set of ""Potential Role"" cards are dealt face up in the center of the table. These represent potential characters that any given player might hold and which would be in play within the room. The players themselves are only a subset of these potential roles.These are just a small sample of the Potential Role cards. As you can see, they display a character name and two icons; the icon on the upper left offers a hint at what that character's main victory condition or goal is, and the icon on the upper right offers a hint at that character's bonus score roll conditions -- what this means is at the end of the game, any players who have achieved their victory condition and then also fulfilled bonus roll conditions, get to roll a number of dice to score themselves; the player with the highest score is considered the true winner of the game.This becomes more clear when you see the ""Hidden Role"" cards. Each player will receive two of these, allowing them to choose which role to play; some roles are much more challenging to play than others.As you can see viewing the sample hidden role cards, they offer much more depth about the character, the victory condition, and the bonus roll objectives.The players are also each dealt two ""Special Item"" cards from which they can choose one to bring into the room with them; typically they would want to choose one which compliments their selected character, provided they've been fortunate enough to have been dealt one.The special items aim to be self explanatory and most are allowed to be willingly shared without requiring use. During the game, players can reveal, activate, trade, and/or steal items.Finally, each player also receives one ""Mark"" card, which designates a player seated one or two seats to the left or right, but should not be interpreted as that player must die. The mark is only contextually relevant if the player's selected role or item card use the word Mark; if neither card says Mark, the mark card is meaningless, but all players must hold one.As can be seen in the case of the Protector, the player seated two the left must actually be protected and survive in order for this player to win the game.In addition to these hidden cards, players will each have access to Action Reference cards. These cards are color coded to match mental states which players will be increasing throughout the game: green is for Trust based actions, and red is for Aggression based actions. The actions are tiered, requiring increasing the given state to the level designated in order to unlock a specific action.The game is split into and could last up to six rounds -- provided the players don't make choices or take actions which could end it earlier. At the beginning of the game and in between each round the players receive one double-sided mental state token; everyone privately chooses which mental state to increase, reveals simultaneously, and the next round immediately begins. The tokens are not currency that is spent to attempt actions, rather they simply designate the level of each player's respective mental states and which state specific actions are available for that player to use. Each player is allowed one trust based action and one aggression based action per round; any actions not listed on the card are considered free actions and players may attempt as many of those as they wish.Whenever a player attempts an action against another player who does not want that action to be successful, they each roll a six-sided action die against each other: highest roll wins, any ties go to a defending player.The game ends in one of three ways: If a body is on the trap door -- quick reminder that the players are all trapped together in an exitless room except for a trap door in the center of the floor -- the moderator (or a player acting as moderator) will ask, ""Do all players who are able to speak agree to this sacrifice?"" If the answer is a unanimous ""Yes"" then the trap door opens and the game immediately ends; if any player answers ""No"" the game continues. If the game timer expires on the last and final round, gas floods the room killing everyone inside and ending the game. Alternatively, at the bottom of the Trust based actions, there is one named Escape; if all players manage to escape the room, the game immediately ends, but if only some escape, then the game continues for any left behind.Once the game has concluded, players reveal their hidden role and mark cards and discover who achieved their victory conditions and then who also earned bonus score rolls to determine the game's winner.Again, we highly recommend you watch either the How to Play video tutorial (embedded in the following video section) or the archived PAX West Demo where you can hear the full instructions as explained to a live group and then witness a game play out. Video & Live Streams:

<p>Randice is a dice system with eight dice that define alligment (chaothic evil, legal neutral, neutral bad...), race (between the D&amp;D 3.0 races), gender, social class, worst and best skill (between the 6 in D&amp;D) for  creating easy and quick random characters for tabletop rol games like Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, Discworld, Anima, etc.The general aesthetic of the dice, the packaging and all the extras are inspired by the old school Dungeons and Dragons logos, guidebooks and illustrations.</p>

<p>This set is a lovely creation by two young goblins who studied product design, used to work as  illustrators and graphic design freelancers and also are dice collectors (uh, nerds.) They were talking about DnD and Discworld campaigns anecdotes  and suddenly and idea striked, what if dices could help us even more? how cool it would be if a dice could help us to create and define our characters? We already have different shapes (PolyHero awesome dice, anyone?), colors, textures and even glitter in our dice collections but we don't have any of that! Later we discovered a few business that made some amazing dice that will define aligment, race and social class for rpg characters but we wanted even more, a dice set that will create our full defined characters AND npcs ready to be played. Our product developer Carlos Rodas started setting the most definitory aspects about a character in a fantasy world and playing with drawings and shapes for the dice, our basics were alligment, race and gender, they need to be there. Later we decided that class and job is also a fun essential to limit the present and past of our character and for more fun we added best and worst skill. The Skill Duo is the most innovative and it will be the game changer in all the campaigns.</p>
<p>We want to make Randice come to life not only for us but for a loving and fun community, after the campaign and the delivery to our amazing backers we want to reach the market with an online shop and have deals with our local tabletop game stores here in Galicia, Spain. Also it woud be even more awesome to reach to other countries stores.</p>

We tested this method with our best Dungeon Master and local artist Daniel Corrada Rodríguez, IG: @s_laighe (he loves the dice set!) and he created this awesome drawings with the results:

A very rich chaotic neutral elvish scammer with a lot of intelligence.

Lumberjack elf who was banished for murdering a dryad.

An exiled halfing king with a very good heart
You also can define individual characteristics by rolling the dice duo or the individual you want. With Randice you can create full NPCS, individual traits about them and reactions! 

The shipping price is already set (sadly we can't do free shipping but all the prices are reasonable, please, understand that we ship all from Spain), we taked the final product and the final packaging and consulted our post office. If something happens (lost package or damages) you are going to be compensated, we will send you another package with no additional cost. WE DO WORLDWIDE SHIPPING. 



(UNLOCKED!) As second goal if we get to 6.250€ (7.105$) we will upgrade the quality even more and we will be able to manufacture the moulds for Randice with solid colors and engraved sides.



We are a starting tabletop games company based en Galicia, Spain who loves fantasy, rol games, D&D and cool ideas to have fun. This is our second project with Kickstarter!

We want to say thank you to our amazing beta testers:
Daniel Corrada, Iván Chapela, Anxo Piñeiro (Chuco), Anthony Álvarez (Tony), Iván Argibai, Juan José Vázquez, Marisa Troncoso and you, for your time and support.
And thank you to our best cameraman Martín Rodas.

<p><i>Treasures of Singapore is created by Lawrence and Li Fong, who are self-proclaimed Singapore cultural ambassadors. Both of us are always proud of what can be found within Singapore. For example, our delicious food  and The Changi Airport. And, we are usually not shy about promoting these treasures we have to our friends, far and near.</i></p>
<p>Treasures of Singapore is not the first project about Singapore that both Lawrence and Li Fong have worked on together. Our first one is The Nation Building Animation that we have produced together, supported by The SG50 Celebration Fund. With the support of many, it won the Best Animation Award in The Delhi Shorts International Film Festival 2015.</p>
<p>You see, most of us Singaporeans are unusually humble and do not go out in a loud and obnoxious way to show how proud we are of Singapore, even in the presence of our children.</p>
<p>For instance, when different parts of the world express their awe of our Changi airport and things that we have achieved, we may just click a “Like” button though we are extremely proud of it.</p>
<p>Hence, through this project, we want our younger generations to appreciate and remember that Singapore has a lot of treasures within, some of them we might have been taking for granted until we are far and away from our homes (when Li Fong is now residing in Texas while Lawrence is in China).</p>
<p>So, we have decided to work together again to develop a playing card set with illustrations of Singapore culture, integrated with an app, augmented reality (AR) and a traditional game component. These, in their own ways and in different occasions, can serve as a tool for us to tell our children more about Singapore and how hard it was for Singapore to achieve what it has today. It can also serve as a gift for our overseas friends who have visited Singapore or would like to know more about Singapore.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have set a goal of USD4,560 for the followings which we hope you can give us your support:</p>
<ol>
<li>Production of the cards and their packaging as well as the inclusion of 1 traditional game, that is, a chapteh in it.</li>
<li>Development of interactive videos to be embedded as Augmented Reality (AR) in the cards using HP Reveal Augmented Reality Studio.</li>
<li>Development of an app that consists of extensive information on Singapore, for children and families.</li>
</ol>
<p>At the end of the campaign, we will start the above processes and you will receive:</p>
<ul>
<li>The card set with the chapteh by March 2019.</li>
<li>The instructions to view the embedded videos on the card set by March 2019. </li>
<li>The app by May 2019</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>With this integrated card game, our children will know the significance of the treasures Singapore has in different ways. They will also be able to share proudly these treasures with their overseas peers and say, “We are from Singapore. This is where we belong. These are what we have!”</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As Lawrence and I are not residing in Singapore now, we may not be able to pack these orders and send them out personally to our contributors. However, we have good support in terms of logistics in Singapore to fulfil these orders. Nevertheless, we are only able to fulfil the orders to be delivered to Singapore and United States of America.</p>

<h3>Spirits of the Scent Oracle card deck</h3>
<p>In 2014 I embarked on my journey in aromatherapy training. I didn’t really know what to expect, I just enrolled myself in the course, listening to my instinct and following the flow of life as I have always done. Exceeding all my expectations the study of the essential oils brought me closer to Mother Nature and opened up my spirituality. I started looking deeper in the world of woo, getting into crystals, daily meditations with essential oils, connecting with my angel guides and animal spirits. Naturally, Tarot and Oracle decks became part of my daily practice. After a lot of trial and error, I realised that cards have a lot to offer on spiritual growth and understanding of the self.</p>
<p>I consider myself to be very lucky to get into the whole woo thing with my sister, Space Odetty, the illustrator of this amazing deck, as this world can be so lonely for some…  Together we studied the cards, give readings to each other and learning the ways of understanding this spiritual tool. Soon enough, I had a big collection of Tarot and Oracle cards, themed with angels, spirit animals, crystals, fairies, herbs and so on. Somewhere down the line, we came up with the idea of creating our very own essential oil deck, depicting the spirits of the essential oils. I would put my essential oil knowledge and Space Odetty her amazing artwork. </p>

<p>It took about two years for the deck to be completed, spending hours over Skype working on the cards (I live in UK and she lives in Greece). Throughout the process we could feel the magical impact of the cards in our lives as well as our relationship. With great love for what we do, and most importantly for each other, we managed to bring this project to life: 36 cards-36 essential oil spirits, to support emotional and spiritual transformation. </p>

<h3>About Aromatherapy and essential oils</h3>
<p>Aromatherapy is a complementary therapy that uses essential oils to promote and maintain the well-being of the body, mind and spirit. Essential oils can help with various ailments and physical problems, as well as emotional discomforts and energetic blockages. They are extracted from the blossoms, leaves, fruits, roots and wood of plants, including herbs, grasses, trees and flowers. The aromatic molecules enter the nose through special smell nerves, travel to our limbic system and regulate the nervous system and soothing the emotions. When applied topically, essential oils enter our body through the tiny blood vessels under the skin to offer their healing properties. </p>

Of course, life has reserved many obstacles for me, each of which has directed my life in a different direction.

The premium materials used offer a superior quality of finishes and processing and a very pleasant feeling to the touch.          Each book is made of a brass sheet with a thickness of 0.3 mm, thus maintaining the feeling of naturalness, but also a good maneuverability for different schemes. The story behind it          I translated this idea into a collection of 12 editions, each with a different topic. The first collection, called Destiny, has as its central element the Yin-Yang emblem.          I chose it as the first edition, because since I was little, being a more independent person, I tried to trace my destiny alone. Of course, life has reserved many obstacles for me, each of which has directed my life in a different direction. Seeing that with the passing of the years, my destiny was shaping in a completely different direction than the one I wanted, I finally managed to start shaping my true destiny. This is the significance of the two central elements, destiny and yin-yang.          I hope that this pack of playing cards will symbolize the same thing for you and that you will believe again that no matter how many joys or troubles you will encounter, you can write the course of your destiny for yourself. What We Need & What You Get          The project is in the final stage, that of being launched on the market. But for its mass production, we need external funds. All the money raised from the campaign will be used to support the investment in processing equipment, but also in raw materials. Being a premium product, all production materials are of the highest quality.           Let's see what you receive in exchange for your contribution!         Each deck of playing cards contains 54 cards from a superior brass alloy. Each card has a different design, different from the classic playing cards. The cutout is made with laser, thus maintaining a perfect contour for each piece. The engraving is performed mechanically, with the help of a cnc machine. By mechanical engraving I wanted to obtain a special design, but also resistant in time, no matter how much you will play with these cards.          We also wanted our product to be a top one. Thus, we continued the series of innovations, the 2 covers with 3D engravings that cover the package give a plus of style and elegance to each deck. By combining brass and copper alloys, we obtained a three-dimensional image of the logo, as well as the name of the first edition.           Front cover                   Back cover          The fastening of the 2 covers is made with a twisted leather cord, creating an embossed design on the edge of the package.            Continuing the series of innovations, we created the design of a truly magical brass bottle. With a fluid shape and copper inserts, each bottle will contain 10 ml of polishing solution.          With the help of the 3 suede cloths you will be able to polish and restore each time the initial shine of the books, these remaining the same as at the beginning.          But the most special innovation consists in the box made of maple wood and treated in a mahogany color. Each box is cut from a single block of maple, the outer and inner cuts being also made on a cnc machine. The finishes are made by hand for a superior fineness.          The 2 lids are also made of the same material and are attached to the box by 2 special brass rivets, which allow them to rotate up to an angle of 270 degrees.           What is the item ""Reserve next edition"" ?          Through this item you can be the first to receive the release date of the next edition of playing cards. Also, at the launch of the next campaign, you will receive the film with the creation of the new package of playing cards.          A strong point when purchasing this item is that when you purchase the next package, you will be among the first to receive it. What is the item ""Custom deck"" ?          The customized package includes all the items that contain them and the standard package. The differences consist in:
custom logo after the buyer's name engraved on the back of each playing card
custom logo after the buyer's name engraved on the two covers
custom logo after the buyer's name engraved on a brass medallion embedded in front of the box
custom logo after the buyer's name engraved on the polishing bottle
two-tone leather cord for tying covers
limited series engraving
free reservation for the next edition
 What bonus will the item ""10 decks of playing cards"" bring?          By purchasing this item, you will receive, in addition to the corresponding discount, a free reservation for the next edition. Why do we want to give life to this project?          We can say that every child had a pack of playing cards at one point. Being among the first things that brought us with our childhood friends, we are currently trying to bring back those beautiful moments. A difficult project? Yes, but beautiful.          Being a premium product, the attempts to make it were difficult. From choosing the best alloy to meet several conditions: clarity, touch feel, processing but also making drawings by mechanical engraving, all required a lot of testing.          Finally we managed to create a product that meets all our expectations. From new, unique and beauty to which I transposed it to this product, you will find in it a gift for you but also for those close to you. You can help make this dream come true          You can also help us make this project a reality by promoting it on various social platforms. A simple share can mean for us a step closer to realization.                          With appreciation,                                          the leader of the Destiny team!",14.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, I am Amy Holzeard and when I was 13, I picked up role-playing dice for the first time and since then all I've wanted to do was to have a place where people who also love gaming can gather to enjoy our games and each other company. For year I have used my home to accomplish this but that limits the amount of people and what we can do. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>What I intend to do is open a premier gaming establishment her on Indianapolis's south side. A place where there's plenty or room (both public and private) a large selection of games (to play and buy) and plenty of snacks.</p>
<p>One way or another we will be opening, what I need your help to do is to make out game library bigger,  increase the stock we have in store and if we're lucky increase the overall size of the store! So we can have even more space for the local community!</p>
<p>To make this dream a reality we will need about $25,000 the good news is: We can cover most of it. All we need from this campaign is $10,000. If manage to get more than that it will make the whole process easier and allow us to put more in the game room. </p>
<p>If we unfortunately don't make it to the $10,000 any money that we do raise will go to the store getting what ever we can to make it the bast gaming place we can.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remember no matter who you are you can help us out by getting this out into the world. Even if your normally not in Indianapolis, you can still share this with any gamers you know because we will have special events during Gen-Con and all the other cons The we host here in the Hoosier State.  So please share with everyone one you can.

<p>Escape from Darkmoor Keep (EFDK) is the second title in the Legorian Kings Saga, with the first being Labyrinth: The Lich Lord's Lair. A multi-quest gamebook written in the style of the Choose Your Own Adventure and Fighting Fantasy gamebooks, YOU (and/or your party, if you are playing with multiple players) determine the outcome of the story by the choices that you make! In fact, sometimes, your very fate(s) will even depend on the roll of the dice themselves! </p>

<p>The second title in the Legorian Kings Saga finds you, the adventurer, trapped on the mysterious and savage island of Darkmoor Keep with no memory or knowledge of how you got there, or even why. But can you survive long enough to solve the mystery, or will you become just another one of the island's many casualties? </p>

<p>You awaken with a start, still lost in the lingering haze from a restless and tormented sleep. As your eyes gradually adjust to the dim light of your surroundings, you realize that you are in a strange and unfamiliar place. A quick surveil of your environment tells you everything in an instant. You are in what appears to be some sort of holding cell, a prisoner no doubt within the dark and dank confines of some unknown dungeon. Rough-hewn brick and mortar-daubed walls greet you on all sides, and other than the one single, wooden door with a small barred window at eye-level, there is no other means in, or out of your place of confinement. </p>
<p>Even more disturbing are the nagging questions now flooding your mind. ‘How did you get here?’ And, ‘Where exactly is HERE?’</p>
<p>Groggy and still somewhat disoriented, you make your way over to the door, and much to your surprise, find that it is ajar. The door groans reluctantly as you swing it open upon its rusty hinges, and step out into corridor beyond.</p>
<p>You find yourself in a wide corridor, its entire length lined on both sides with the very same holding cells like the one you awoke in. Your first instinctive reaction is to be on the lookout for the inevitable arrival of the guards, for most certainly they must have heard your cell door opening. But even after an indefinite amount of time has passed, no one comes, and except for the flickering of the torches and the occasional squeaky chatter of the rats, the dungeon hall is as silent as a tomb. A few randomly-placed torches throughout dispel the darkness.</p>
<p>A cursory scan of your surroundings helps you to quickly determine your next move, with you immediately making for the flight of stairs at the far end, and heading up them. </p>
<p>The stairway spirals upward, terminating at a large wooden door. Placing your ear to the wood, you listen closely, but are unable to hear anything through the heavy, oaken panel. Quietly and cautiously, you open the door, but only just wide enough to see what lies beyond.</p>
<p>A dimly lit chamber greets you on the other side, and other than a large wooden chest in one of the corners, the room is completely empty. There is another door directly opposite of you on the far facing wall.</p>
<p>Making your way to the chest, you discover that it is unlocked, and carefully raise the lid, knowing full well that there might be traps. You are astonished by what you find, for inside of the chest, is an incredible assortment of weapons, and with the only exception being the mage’s staff, every one of them has been forged out of silver.</p>
<p>(From the list below, and based on the CHARACTER CLASS that you elected at the start of the game, you must now choose your weapon. If you chose to be a WARRIOR, you must select ONE of the melee weapons below. If, however, the CHARACTER CLASS you chose to be was a mage, your weapons by default will automatically be the mage’s staff and the silver dagger. The shield may be used in conjunction with any of the one-handed weapons. </p>
<p>You do have the option to change your CHARACTER CLASS now, if you would like to do so.</p>
<p>SILVER TWO-HANDED BROADSWORD</p>
<p>SILVER TWO-HANDED BATTLE AXE</p>
<p>SILVER TWO-HANDED MACE</p>
<p>SILVER ONE-HANDED SWORD</p>
<p>SILVER ONE-HANDED BATTLE AXE</p>
<p>SILVER ONE-HANDED MACE</p>
<p>SILVER DAGGER</p>
<p>SHIELD</p>
<p>MAGE’S STAFF</p>
<p>The chest also contains several TORCHES and a SATCHEL (which from here on out, will represent your INVENTORY(s). </p>
<p>Add the weapon(s) you chose, as well as the torch, to your INVENTORY(s) now).</p>
<p>After arming yourself, and listening for a brief moment at the other door, you cautiously open the door and exit the chamber.</p>
<p>Go to <strong>66</strong> </p>
<p><strong>66 </strong></p>
<p>The door introduces you to a long and narrow corridor, which eventually finds its end at yet another door, this one much larger than the previous two. With your weapon in hand and ready for whatever might await you on the other side, you open the door.</p>
<p>Dazzling sunlight immediately floods in, and for more than a moment, you are temporarily blinded by the unexpected, and sudden brightness, as you step through the open doorway and outside. </p>
<p>You are standing on a massive shelf of rock that juts out from the precipitous face of a cliff. Below you, gigantic waves crash violently and relentlessly against its rocky base, with the thundering impact of the pounding surf punctuated only by the stuttering squawks of seagulls. </p>
<p>Doing a quick visual scan of the jagged cliff’s exterior, you discover what appear to be hand and footholds carved into the cliffside, starting right where you are standing, and going all the way to the very top.</p>
<p>To your right, you can see a pathway that precariously hugs the precipice as it descends, gradually making its way down the side of the cliff until it reaches a sand-covered beach at the very bottom.</p>
<p>On your immediate left, and disappearing over the edge of the shelf of rock on which you are standing, is a crude ladder constructed out of rope and driftwood. Peering downward, you see another outcropping of rock a short distance below, and what looks like the entrance to a small cave. </p>
<p>If you decide to try and scale the cliff face, go to <strong>172</strong></p>
<p>If you want to head down the path, go to <strong>27</strong></p>
<p>Maybe the rope ladder is the safest bet. If this is your choice, go to <strong>111</strong></p>
<p><strong>And so begins the next chapter of the Legorian Kings Saga!</strong></p>

<p><strong>PLAYING WITH MULTIPLE PLAYERS</strong></p>
<p>Not only can this gamebook be played as a single-player, solo adventure, but it can also be modified to create a multiplayer co-op experience for up to 4 PLAYERS for you and your friends. This especially comes into play when facing an opponent. In order to make these encounters more challenging for you and your party, you may be asked at times to INCREASE the NUMBER OF OPPONENTS you are fighting to accommodate the number of members in your party. In other instances, you may be told to INCREASE the HEALTH score(s) of your opponent(s).</p>
<p>In addition, when doing a co-op, unless otherwise specified, whatever items you and your fellow adventurers may discover during your quest are MULTIPLIED as well by the NUMBER OF PLAYERS in your party. Each one of you can then add these items to your own individual inventories.</p>
<p>Items in your INVENTORY(s), including potions and even gold pieces, may also be given to your teammates, but must be removed from your INVENTORY(s) when you do so.</p>
<p><strong>COMBAT</strong></p>
<p>The combat in this RPG fantasy adventure gamebook is a TURN-BASED, DICE ROLL system. </p>
<p>WHO ATTACKS FIRST?</p>
<p>Who attacks first, whether it is you and your partner(s), or your opponent(s), can be based on a number of factors. For example, in some scenarios, if you surprise your opponent, then by default, you would get to attack first, and vice versa, the same would apply if a monster gets the jump on you. There may also be instances where you perform a sneak attack. Otherwise, in most cases, you will have to roll to see who will be attacking first. To determine who, roll ONE die for you (and your party), and then roll ONE die for your opponent(s). The person/party that has the highest roll gets to attack first.</p>
<p>THE BATTLE MECHANICS</p>
<p>(The 3d6 attack, defense, and damage roll system) </p>
<p>If you are the one attacking, roll ALL THREE dice for your attack and then ALL THREE dice for your opponent. If you are doing a co-op, each one of you, in turn, gets an attack roll. If your roll is the HIGHER of the two, then your attack is successful. If your opponent’s roll is EQUAL TO or HIGHER than your roll, your attack either missed, or was deflected by your opponent. If your attack is successful, roll ALL THREE dice to determine the AMOUNT OF DAMAGE that was inflicted by your attack, and subtract that amount from your opponent’s HEALTH score. If you are doing a co-op, each member of your party, in turn, also get an attack roll, and your opponent(s) must counter roll to defend against each one of those attack(s). You can keep a tally of that damage on a separate sheet of paper.</p>
<p>The sequence of combat is exactly the same when your opponent is attacking you. Roll ALL THREE dice for your opponent(s)’ attack and then roll all THREE dice for your defense roll(s). If you are doing a co-op, each one of you individually will have to do defense rolls and roll individually for damage.</p>
<p>Typical COMBAT encounters will look something like this:</p>
<p>ROUND 1</p>
<p>YOU:  Roll an attack roll of 5+5+4 for a three dice total of 14</p>
<p>ORC:  Rolls a defensive roll of 6+3+3 for a three dice total of 12</p>
<p>(Because your attack roll of 14 is GREATER than the orc’s defensive counter roll of 12, your attack is successful! All three dice are then rolled to determine how much DAMAGE was inflicted by your attack, and is then SUBTRACTED from the orc’s HEALTH score)</p>
<p>ROUND 2</p>
<p>ORC:  Rolls an attack roll of 3+5+3 for a three dice total of 11 </p>
<p>YOU:  Roll a defensive roll of 6+2+3 for a three dice total of 11</p>
<p>(Because your defensive roll was EQUAL to the attack roll of the orc, the orc’s attack either missed or was successfully deflected by you, so no damage was taken by you this round).</p>
<p>MULTIPLE PLAYERS VERSUS MULTIPLE OPPONENTS </p>
<p>YOU:  Roll a 3d6 attack roll </p>
<p>PARTY MEMBER: Rolls a 3d6 attack roll </p>
<p>PARTY MEMBER: Rolls a 3d6 attack roll </p>
<p>GOBLINOIDS: Roll a 3d6 defense roll as a SINGLE opponent</p>
<p>Combat continues until you and your party, or the opposing side are eliminated!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1570077461/xprzk25eghbh9v8bx8nq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>MULTIPLE OPPONENTS</p>
<p>Multiple opponents are treated as a SINGLE MONSTER, and only get one attack roll because in real-life scenarios they would attack simultaneously. They also defend as ONE with a SINGLE roll.</p>
<p>MULTIPLAYER ATTACK AND DEFENSE ROLLS</p>
<p>When doing a multiplayer co-op, when it is your turn to attack, each player in your party gets an individual attack roll, but your opponent(s) roll a SINGLE defensive roll against each one of those attacks. The same holds true if your party is being attacked. Your opponent(s) roll a SINGLE attack roll, but each member in your party gets to do a counter roll.</p>

</div></div>","Escape from Darkmoor Keep (EFDK) is the second title in the Legorian Kings Saga, with the first being Labyrinth: The Lich Lord's Lair. A multi-quest gamebook written in the style of the Choose Your Own Adventure and Fighting Fantasy gamebooks, YOU (and/or your party, if you are playing with multiple players) determine the outcome of the story by the choices that you make! In fact, sometimes, your very fate(s) will even depend on the roll of the dice themselves! 

The second title in the Legorian Kings Saga finds you, the adventurer, trapped on the mysterious and savage island of Darkmoor Keep with no memory or knowledge of how you got there, or even why. But can you survive long enough to solve the mystery, or will you become just another one of the island's many casualties? 







EndGame Gaming is also excited to announce that fantasy artist, Ilya Shkipin, will be returning to do the artwork for EFDK. These are samples of the incredible work he did for our first gamebook.  




You awaken with a start, still lost in the lingering haze from a restless and tormented sleep. As your eyes gradually adjust to the dim light of your surroundings, you realize that you are in a strange and unfamiliar place. A quick surveil of your environment tells you everything in an instant. You are in what appears to be some sort of holding cell, a prisoner no doubt within the dark and dank confines of some unknown dungeon. Rough-hewn brick and mortar-daubed walls greet you on all sides, and other than the one single, wooden door with a small barred window at eye-level, there is no other means in, or out of your place of confinement. 
Even more disturbing are the nagging questions now flooding your mind. ‘How did you get here?’ And, ‘Where exactly is HERE?’
Groggy and still somewhat disoriented, you make your way over to the door, and much to your surprise, find that it is ajar. The door groans reluctantly as you swing it open upon its rusty hinges, and step out into corridor beyond.
You find yourself in a wide corridor, its entire length lined on both sides with the very same holding cells like the one you awoke in. Your first instinctive reaction is to be on the lookout for the inevitable arrival of the guards, for most certainly they must have heard your cell door opening. But even after an indefinite amount of time has passed, no one comes, and except for the flickering of the torches and the occasional squeaky chatter of the rats, the dungeon hall is as silent as a tomb. A few randomly-placed torches throughout dispel the darkness.
A cursory scan of your surroundings helps you to quickly determine your next move, with you immediately making for the flight of stairs at the far end, and heading up them. 
The stairway spirals upward, terminating at a large wooden door. Placing your ear to the wood, you listen closely, but are unable to hear anything through the heavy, oaken panel. Quietly and cautiously, you open the door, but only just wide enough to see what lies beyond.
A dimly lit chamber greets you on the other side, and other than a large wooden chest in one of the corners, the room is completely empty. There is another door directly opposite of you on the far facing wall.
Making your way to the chest, you discover that it is unlocked, and carefully raise the lid, knowing full well that there might be traps. You are astonished by what you find, for inside of the chest, is an incredible assortment of weapons, and with the only exception being the mage’s staff, every one of them has been forged out of silver.
(From the list below, and based on the CHARACTER CLASS that you elected at the start of the game, you must now choose your weapon. If you chose to be a WARRIOR, you must select ONE of the melee weapons below. If, however, the CHARACTER CLASS you chose to be was a mage, your weapons by default will automatically be the mage’s staff and the silver dagger. The shield may be used in conjunction with any of the one-handed weapons. 
You do have the option to change your CHARACTER CLASS now, if you would like to do so.
SILVER TWO-HANDED BROADSWORD
SILVER TWO-HANDED BATTLE AXE
SILVER TWO-HANDED MACE
SILVER ONE-HANDED SWORD
SILVER ONE-HANDED BATTLE AXE
SILVER ONE-HANDED MACE
SILVER DAGGER
SHIELD
MAGE’S STAFF
The chest also contains several TORCHES and a SATCHEL (which from here on out, will represent your INVENTORY(s). 
Add the weapon(s) you chose, as well as the torch, to your INVENTORY(s) now).
After arming yourself, and listening for a brief moment at the other door, you cautiously open the door and exit the chamber.
Go to 66 
66 
The door introduces you to a long and narrow corridor, which eventually finds its end at yet another door, this one much larger than the previous two. With your weapon in hand and ready for whatever might await you on the other side, you open the door.
Dazzling sunlight immediately floods in, and for more than a moment, you are temporarily blinded by the unexpected, and sudden brightness, as you step through the open doorway and outside. 
You are standing on a massive shelf of rock that juts out from the precipitous face of a cliff. Below you, gigantic waves crash violently and relentlessly against its rocky base, with the thundering impact of the pounding surf punctuated only by the stuttering squawks of seagulls. 
Doing a quick visual scan of the jagged cliff’s exterior, you discover what appear to be hand and footholds carved into the cliffside, starting right where you are standing, and going all the way to the very top.
To your right, you can see a pathway that precariously hugs the precipice as it descends, gradually making its way down the side of the cliff until it reaches a sand-covered beach at the very bottom.
On your immediate left, and disappearing over the edge of the shelf of rock on which you are standing, is a crude ladder constructed out of rope and driftwood. Peering downward, you see another outcropping of rock a short distance below, and what looks like the entrance to a small cave. 
If you decide to try and scale the cliff face, go to 172
If you want to head down the path, go to 27
Maybe the rope ladder is the safest bet. If this is your choice, go to 111
And so begins the next chapter of the Legorian Kings Saga!


 
PLAYING WITH MULTIPLE PLAYERS
Not only can this gamebook be played as a single-player, solo adventure, but it can also be modified to create a multiplayer co-op experience for up to 4 PLAYERS for you and your friends. This especially comes into play when facing an opponent. In order to make these encounters more challenging for you and your party, you may be asked at times to INCREASE the NUMBER OF OPPONENTS you are fighting to accommodate the number of members in your party. In other instances, you may be told to INCREASE the HEALTH score(s) of your opponent(s).
In addition, when doing a co-op, unless otherwise specified, whatever items you and your fellow adventurers may discover during your quest are MULTIPLIED as well by the NUMBER OF PLAYERS in your party. Each one of you can then add these items to your own individual inventories.
Items in your INVENTORY(s), including potions and even gold pieces, may also be given to your teammates, but must be removed from your INVENTORY(s) when you do so.
COMBAT
The combat in this RPG fantasy adventure gamebook is a TURN-BASED, DICE ROLL system. 
WHO ATTACKS FIRST?
Who attacks first, whether it is you and your partner(s), or your opponent(s), can be based on a number of factors. For example, in some scenarios, if you surprise your opponent, then by default, you would get to attack first, and vice versa, the same would apply if a monster gets the jump on you. There may also be instances where you perform a sneak attack. Otherwise, in most cases, you will have to roll to see who will be attacking first. To determine who, roll ONE die for you (and your party), and then roll ONE die for your opponent(s). The person/party that has the highest roll gets to attack first.
THE BATTLE MECHANICS
(The 3d6 attack, defense, and damage roll system) 
If you are the one attacking, roll ALL THREE dice for your attack and then ALL THREE dice for your opponent. If you are doing a co-op, each one of you, in turn, gets an attack roll. If your roll is the HIGHER of the two, then your attack is successful. If your opponent’s roll is EQUAL TO or HIGHER than your roll, your attack either missed, or was deflected by your opponent. If your attack is successful, roll ALL THREE dice to determine the AMOUNT OF DAMAGE that was inflicted by your attack, and subtract that amount from your opponent’s HEALTH score. If you are doing a co-op, each member of your party, in turn, also get an attack roll, and your opponent(s) must counter roll to defend against each one of those attack(s). You can keep a tally of that damage on a separate sheet of paper.
The sequence of combat is exactly the same when your opponent is attacking you. Roll ALL THREE dice for your opponent(s)’ attack and then roll all THREE dice for your defense roll(s). If you are doing a co-op, each one of you individually will have to do defense rolls and roll individually for damage.
Typical COMBAT encounters will look something like this:
ROUND 1
YOU:  Roll an attack roll of 5+5+4 for a three dice total of 14
ORC:  Rolls a defensive roll of 6+3+3 for a three dice total of 12
(Because your attack roll of 14 is GREATER than the orc’s defensive counter roll of 12, your attack is successful! All three dice are then rolled to determine how much DAMAGE was inflicted by your attack, and is then SUBTRACTED from the orc’s HEALTH score)
ROUND 2
ORC:  Rolls an attack roll of 3+5+3 for a three dice total of 11 
YOU:  Roll a defensive roll of 6+2+3 for a three dice total of 11
(Because your defensive roll was EQUAL to the attack roll of the orc, the orc’s attack either missed or was successfully deflected by you, so no damage was taken by you this round).
MULTIPLE PLAYERS VERSUS MULTIPLE OPPONENTS 
YOU:  Roll a 3d6 attack roll 
PARTY MEMBER: Rolls a 3d6 attack roll 
PARTY MEMBER: Rolls a 3d6 attack roll 
GOBLINOIDS: Roll a 3d6 defense roll as a SINGLE opponent
Combat continues until you and your party, or the opposing side are eliminated!

MULTIPLE OPPONENTS
Multiple opponents are treated as a SINGLE MONSTER, and only get one attack roll because in real-life scenarios they would attack simultaneously. They also defend as ONE with a SINGLE roll.
MULTIPLAYER ATTACK AND DEFENSE ROLLS
When doing a multiplayer co-op, when it is your turn to attack, each player in your party gets an individual attack roll, but your opponent(s) roll a SINGLE defensive roll against each one of those attacks. The same holds true if your party is being attacked. Your opponent(s) roll a SINGLE attack roll, but each member in your party gets to do a counter roll.

Both the paperback and hardback editions of the book will be approximately 6"" x 9"" and will be between 250 and 300 pages in total length, depending on the final number of illustrations.

<li>Open the game and select 5 of the 10 categories of cards. Take all of each category and shuffle them together. (This means to grab all character and info cards in a category and shuffle them together.)</li>
<li>There are four different types of card decks used in the game. Character cards are cards that hold the image of a certain famous person. Info cards are a matching type of card for each famous person that gives in-depth info. These are used to make a pair. When a character and info card are paired together, it’s considered a match! You may then place them on the play pile and collect a matching coin token as a reward. Scissor cards are special cards that allow you to steal a player’s match reward--provided you use them properly. Finally, Legend cards are a special type of card with unique use. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1546191365/orczsdpztrk6hpznm0j3.jpg"" src=""""/>

<li><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>As mentioned shuffle these five categories of Character/Info cards together, then deal each player 6 cards from the shuffled deck.</span></li>

<li>The dealer goes first in a clockwise direction. Each player’s goal is to eliminate all of the cards in your hand. This is done by matching an info card with a Character card.</li>
<li>To do this, you can draw from the deck. In addition to this, you may also grab from the last 2 cards placed on the table by any other player.</li>
<li>You can hold any number of cards, however since your goal is to get rid of cards you want to focus on matches, using legend cards or steals to get rid of the cars in your hand.</li>
<li> When you’ve emptied your hands of cards, place your final match on the table and say “Eureka”! This will signal the end of the game.</li>
</ul><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>How To Win:)</strong></h2><ul>
<li>Once a player at the table has shouted “Eureka” and placed their cards down, that player may draw 2 additional coin cards</li>
<li>If no other players have scissor cards to play, then the sum each player’s coin cards are tallied. The player with the highest coin card count wins the game.</li>
<li>On the chance that another player uses a Scissor card then -- a played Scissor Card at the game’s end allows you to postpone the ending of the game by forcing up to 2 cards of your choice from your own hand on the player who initiated the game’s end. If a scissor card is played against another player after they say “Eureka” a couple of things happen:</li>
</ul><ol>
<li>a)They may NOT collect 2 coin cards.</li>
<li><p>b)Doing this will cause the game to begin again with the next person in the turn order.<br/> </p></li>
</ol><p> </p><p>    The player with the highest coin count wins the game.</p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Using Special Cards:)</strong></h2><p>Scissor Cards:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1546191432/z52sxqmmssgghvrx8vnv.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Scissor cards cannot be traded between players and there exists 3 cards of this type in the whole game. Using one will allow you to steal coin rewards from another player’s match. In addition, you also can place up to 2 of your cards down (any two of your choosing).</p><p>If you manage to collect more than one scissor card at a time (very hard to do!) you can perform special actions!</p><p>You may play multiple scissor cards at one time. This means, for instance, if you play 2 cards against one player you can collect card rewards twice, and get rid of 4 cards at once </p><p>Likewise, if you have at least 2 cards you can sacrifice both cards at the same time in order to collect coin rewards. This can be done at any time with no requirements to fulfill.  For each card you sacrifice in this manner you can draw 2 coin tokens.</p><p>There is a restriction to using Scissor Cards, there are symbols on each card that match the categories of cards. You must match the symbols in order to play a card against another player.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1548084914/kwfflsu9uv96ejncl1ij.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">To play a scissor card, shout “Cut!” and place the card down before they can collect their coin token!</p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Legends Cards:)</h2><p> </p><ul>
<li>Legend Cards are special cards that can match up with ANY Character or Info card. So for example, if you have 1 card remaining in your hand, and you draw a Legend card, you can immediately pair it in order to form a match and initiate the end of the game as an example.</li>
<li>Another benefit of a Legend card is that matches made with them cannot have Scissors played against them.</li>

<strong>Challenges:)</strong><br/> </h2><ul>
<li>Challenging a player involves betting 1 or more of your coins. When you challenge someone you place up to 5 (and no less than 1) coin face down in front of you and point to the player you’re challenging.</li>
<li>The challenged player HAS to respond. If they refuse your challenge, you get to choose 1 of their coins (your choice).</li>
<li>If they accept your challenge then that player also has to decide on up to 3 coins to wager, then both of you draw a card from the center and place it face down in front of you. At the same time, both of you flip the card. If either of you can match the other person’s card--that person wins the challenge, at which point they take all their coins, all of the coins of the player you challenged and you get to get rid of one extra card in your hand without fulfilling the match condition.</li>
<li>If you find yourself with 0 cards in your hand after completing a challenge, yell Eureka to initiate the game’s end.</li>

In this age of Social Media, YouTube and Online Gaming, it can be almost impossible to separate kids from their screens. Wouldn't it be nice if there was a way that children could have fun AND learn at the same time?Sounds like a dream? It’s actually a reality.Our team of eight created the Legends Card Game, which teaches children (or teenagers) about history as they play. They’ll learn about history's greatest scientists, artists, and other historical figures, all while focused and engaged in friendly competition. It is our hope that by exposing kids to the greatest people from humanity's past, they may find inspiration. After all, children are the future.Here’s the good news.For only $19, you can have your own set.The Legends Card Game is seeking your support so we can spread our game onto the global market. With your help, we can make our dream a reality. Thank you for your support!Children Learn Best When Having FunThe Legends Card game is the world’s only game which gives your children an in-depth history lesson as they play along. You can play with family, friends or even at school.Here Are The Benefits Of Playing The Legends Card Game: 
Develop memory and information retention skills.
Playing games helps develop focusing skills.
Have fun while developing social skills (something that is sometimes lost in our online world).
And much, much more!Parents and Educators: when you invest in a copy of our game, you are not just providing you children years of entertainment - you're also investing in their future.It’s our mission to change education forever. Let's do it together!                                                                        RULE BOOK  https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/read/62351909/legends-gameplay-manual-v1                                                
Open the game and select 5 of the 10 categories of cards. Take all of each category and shuffle them together. (This means to grab all character and info cards in a category and shuffle them together.)
There are four different types of card decks used in the game. Character cards are cards that hold the image of a certain famous person. Info cards are a matching type of card for each famous person that gives in-depth info. These are used to make a pair. When a character and info card are paired together, it’s considered a match! You may then place them on the play pile and collect a matching coin token as a reward. Scissor cards are special cards that allow you to steal a player’s match reward--provided you use them properly. Finally, Legend cards are a special type of card with unique use. 

As mentioned shuffle these five categories of Character/Info cards together, then deal each player 6 cards from the shuffled deck.
Place the remaining cards in the center of the table. These cards can be pulled from at your leisure -- or switched out in order to make proper matches as you play.
The dealer goes first in a clockwise direction. Each player’s goal is to eliminate all of the cards in your hand. This is done by matching an info card with a Character card.
To do this, you can draw from the deck. In addition to this, you may also grab from the last 2 cards placed on the table by any other player.
You can hold any number of cards, however since your goal is to get rid of cards you want to focus on matches, using legend cards or steals to get rid of the cars in your hand.
 When you’ve emptied your hands of cards, place your final match on the table and say “Eureka”! This will signal the end of the game.
How To Win:)
Once a player at the table has shouted “Eureka” and placed their cards down, that player may draw 2 additional coin cards
If no other players have scissor cards to play, then the sum each player’s coin cards are tallied. The player with the highest coin card count wins the game.
On the chance that another player uses a Scissor card then -- a played Scissor Card at the game’s end allows you to postpone the ending of the game by forcing up to 2 cards of your choice from your own hand on the player who initiated the game’s end. If a scissor card is played against another player after they say “Eureka” a couple of things happen:

a)They may NOT collect 2 coin cards.
b)Doing this will cause the game to begin again with the next person in the turn order. 
     The player with the highest coin count wins the game.Using Special Cards:)Scissor Cards:Scissor cards cannot be traded between players and there exists 3 cards of this type in the whole game. Using one will allow you to steal coin rewards from another player’s match. In addition, you also can place up to 2 of your cards down (any two of your choosing).If you manage to collect more than one scissor card at a time (very hard to do!) you can perform special actions!You may play multiple scissor cards at one time. This means, for instance, if you play 2 cards against one player you can collect card rewards twice, and get rid of 4 cards at once Likewise, if you have at least 2 cards you can sacrifice both cards at the same time in order to collect coin rewards. This can be done at any time with no requirements to fulfill.  For each card you sacrifice in this manner you can draw 2 coin tokens.There is a restriction to using Scissor Cards, there are symbols on each card that match the categories of cards. You must match the symbols in order to play a card against another player.To play a scissor card, shout “Cut!” and place the card down before they can collect their coin token!Legends Cards:) 
Legend Cards are special cards that can match up with ANY Character or Info card. So for example, if you have 1 card remaining in your hand, and you draw a Legend card, you can immediately pair it in order to form a match and initiate the end of the game as an example.
Another benefit of a Legend card is that matches made with them cannot have Scissors played against them.
 
Challenges:) 
Challenging a player involves betting 1 or more of your coins. When you challenge someone you place up to 5 (and no less than 1) coin face down in front of you and point to the player you’re challenging.
The challenged player HAS to respond. If they refuse your challenge, you get to choose 1 of their coins (your choice).
If they accept your challenge then that player also has to decide on up to 3 coins to wager, then both of you draw a card from the center and place it face down in front of you. At the same time, both of you flip the card. If either of you can match the other person’s card--that person wins the challenge, at which point they take all their coins, all of the coins of the player you challenged and you get to get rid of one extra card in your hand without fulfilling the match condition.
If you find yourself with 0 cards in your hand after completing a challenge, yell Eureka to initiate the game’s end.

In other words, how much we consume, how much we generate and how much time we spend on our different daily activities in the course of our lives. In short, all those little big details that define us as one of the most peculiar species on the planet, among all the particularly strange species that exist.  If you have ever wondered which is the footprint you leave on the planet simply by existing, this game may bring you some answers, while also providing you with some good laughs with your friends and family.  If you are familiar with our previous projects, you may know that we are a publishing house which specializes in flipbooks, so we couldn't help including a fun little flipbook feature into the card deck. To discover the animation that we have hidden for your entertainment, you just have to arrange the cards in the right order, slide your finger as if it were a flipbook and that's it! Magic Flipboku style! :)  The animated sequence was created by our great friend and incomparable animator Nacho Rodriguez. An animation genius with a hypnotic and organic style. The sequence is also in a loop, so it doesn't matter when you start turning pages, in the end it will work as long as you keep the cards in the correct numerical order. The sequence is based on a continuous transformation of elements from different illustrations that you will find in the cards. A real treat for the eyes and thumb. ?   It's very easy. The player in charge of asking the question in each round takes the first card from the deck, chooses one of the two questions and reads it out loud. Then, he/she and the rest of the participants have 1 minute to write down their answer. When the time is up, each player reveals his/her bet. The person in charge of that round reads the answer on the back of the card, and the player with the closest number to the correct answer, wins.  Obviously, you will sometimes be way off track with your guess, but what is better than laughing at yourself (except of course laughing at others :D). There are detailed instructions offering variations of the game and score, although the objective is always  the same: to come nearest to the correct value to win each round.  To allow as many humans as possible to play, Do You Realize How Much? will be available in 3 languages: English, Spanish and German. You will be able to choose the version you want after the campaign, when leaving us your shipping details in our pledge manager.  We do not rule out developing possible future editions in other languages, as this would allow us to reach even more humans. :) We affectionately call them Human Zero. They are the result of a match between a man and a woman, inhabiting a developed Western country with a life expectancy of 79 years. All numbers correspond to an average of this Human Zero, the Frankenstein of Do You Realize How Much?.  Since humans are not the center of the universe (or at least shouldn't be), we have designed 2 more fabulous extension packs that can be perfectly combined with the Human Edition: The Animal Edition and the Space Edition. Each edition contains 200 more questions and answers: together the 3 editions make 600 questions and answers - a real number madness!The ANIMAL EDITION includes 200 questions and answers from the animal world, all kinds of interesting data, incredible facts and extraordinary curiosities, in short, everything the amazing world of the animal kingdom has to offer.   If you are a space lover or would like to know more about its incredible mysteries and dimensions, then this is for you. The SPACE EDITION is all about spaceflight, rockets, galaxies, moons and stars, planets and the amazing facts and conditions with which man went to the Moon for the very first time.   Both the Animal Edition and the Space Edition are not only fun and entertaining but also very informative and great learning tools for both, adults and kids (recommended minimum age is 12 years). All the numbers that you will discover in this game are the result of the investigation and research of multiple sources, which were reviewed, compared and processed until we reached the most accurate result possible. Therefore they are approximations or averages based on statistical data. They do not represent an absolute truth, they are figures that reflect the footprint of an average human (the Human Zero exposed above) and obviously can vary over time (hopefully they will change for the better).Each answer is complemented with additional information such as an equivalence, fun facts, shocking revelations or comparisons that help you visualize the magnitude of the numbers in our human footprint and their impact on the planet.  Through this comparison, the number, which at first is merely abstract, takes on another meaning and we can picture the distance in our minds since we have a reference to compare it with.As we know that not all countries use the same units of measurement, to facilitate the understanding of the game and avoid you having to make tedious conversions, all the answers are expressed in the two most important units of measurement: pound-kilograms, inches-centimeters, yards-meters, miles-kilometers, gallons-liters, etc.   48 years later we are looking for the same thing, but instead of wanting to be discovered by aliens we are hoping to rediscover ourselves! And what better than to have the fearless couple of the Pioneer probes as reference models in this journey of discovery of our own human footprint.Good design and packaging are always of great importance in our projects. So we have developed an attractive and handy box that, apart from helping you to arrange the cards while you play, will protect them when you take the game on the road.  All three editions include 100 cards each, featuring two questions and answers as well as two unique illustrations per card. Each card has a small number in the upper left corner. More about that in the next chapter ;)  Our fascination with the human footprint goes back years, and we have always had  the idea of making these breathtaking numbers visible through different formats. Over time we have come to the conclusion that the best way to do this is through a card game. A unique card game that will make you think, take a wild guess, discover, imagine, estimate, laugh, reflect, marvel at and become aware of the astonishing numbers that our nature and human footprint reveal!In addition to having a great time with friends or family, our ultimate goal is to help raise awareness of our human footprint. And who knows, maybe push you to modify some consumption habits, make better decisions and thus become better and more sustainable human beings. And if we are lucky, contribute a tiny little bit to building a better planet for future generations, because the way we are going, we will clearly not get very far.A card game is an excellent learning tool; it’s portable, handy and in this case, it’s a game with very simple rules that does not require any complex instructions.  Flipboku is a publishing house located on the beautiful island of Mallorca, specializing in one-of-a-kind flipbooks.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Robinson Crusoe: Escape from Despair Island is a fast-paced, family-friendly game for 1-4 players, ages 14 and up. Offering a new game play experience every time, with vibrant art on 160 cards, push-your-luck mechanics, and the age-old theme of survival and escape, it will leave you wondering if you have what it takes to make it home alive.</p>
<p>In 1651 a young man leaves home for an adventure at sea, shipwrecked on an island 40 miles out, he spends the next 28 years gathering food, resources, tools, and battling against insurmountable odds to stay alive. He hunts, raises animals, reads the bible, and begins to turn his focus and attention inward. His faith grows and he becomes a man of God, learning to accept his fate, growing spiritually, and realizing that he has everything he needs to survive and live in peace. </p>
<p>Combining themes of hope, strength, and resiliency, this strategic, multi-layered game will test your skills in more ways than one, as you navigate through cannibal attacks, deadly storms, and your own inner turmoil.   </p>

<p>The deck is shuffled, and every player is dealt five cards face down. These cards represent the players’ food supply, with one card being equal to one day's worth of food.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1566922764/jteqaqiawem9chktndf9.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The game proceeds in a clockwise direction and includes two phases of play during each player’s turn - the exploration phase, and the market phase.</p>
<p>During the exploration phase the active player draws cards from the deck in order to take either food cards or camp cards. The market phase opens for other players once the active player has chosen what card to take.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1566921000/kzmaip03yianwdgiad9u.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>At the beginning of every turn, a player must discard one food card into the discard pile. This is the cost of playing the game and represents one day's food supply being used up. </p>
<p>Players take turns flipping cards to find the resources they need. You can think of each flipped card as a new resource or ability your character has uncovered. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1566921049/jranxxjggh3w2gopajvf.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>During the exploration phase a player can flip up to 10 cards. The aim of the exploration phase is to find food and resources and to build the camp and character. Ultimately the goal is to escape from the island. </p>
<p>After a maximum of ten cards have been flipped, the active player chooses which card(s) they are going to keep, leaving the remaining cards on the table for the other players to buy. </p>
<p>There are two ways to take cards from the drawn cards</p>
<p>1) Harvest food cards i.e cards with a green palm tree symbol on the top left and a food icon on the bottom right. When harvesting, take the indicated amount of food from the draw deck and place the food card on the discard pile.</p>
<p>2) Take camp cards such as </p>
<ul>
<li>construction cards with a brown upper left corner symbol, </li>
<li>character cards with a blue upper left corner symbol, or </li>
<li>resource cards with upper left corner green palm tree symbol, other than food cards (if you meet the requirements). </li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1566922889/gnfunolnhidki7yxhykl.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The camp can consist of items like a hut, palisade, box or boat, as well as resources such as a rifle, an axe or gunpowder. Character growth and actual character cards are also placed in the camp. When a player builds an item in their camp, the card is placed image side up on the table in front of the player. </p>
<p>A player can continue flipping cards until either:</p>
<ul>
<li> they have flipped a total of ten cards, in which case the player is forced to decide what card to take, or </li>
<li>they decide to stop and take some of the flipped cards to their camp, or alternatively harvest food when the food card is discarded and food cards are taken from the draw deck, or</li>
<li>they flip a total of two threat cards and cannot defeat the more difficult one</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1566921091/ow7elo6yentqln1hd31y.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>If a second threat card is flipped, the player must then defeat the greater of the two threats (denoted by 1, 2, or 3 skulls in the top right corner of the card) if they want to take some flipped card(s) from the table to their camp. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1566922906/kmpbampmijdmtlx8yst4.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The threat is defeated by having the cards listed on the card’s ""requirement row"". Each card has its own symbol. In the above example, the player does not have any cards in their camp, so the exploration turn is over for that player and they do not get to keep any of the cards they have flipped.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1566922956/lpjworphlark12flxlzi.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>If the player is able to defeat the threat, the card is placed on the discard pile, and they can either continue the exploration phase and drawing cards, or</p>
<ul><li>take the indicated amount of food cards and add them to their pile. The options available after defeating the threat are visible on the bottom of the card where there is either a card deck icon OR a food icon with a number. </li></ul>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Robinson Crusoe: Escape from Despair Island is a fast-paced, family-friendly game for 1-4 players, ages 14 and up. Offering a new game play experience every time, with vibrant art on 160 cards, push-your-luck mechanics, and the age-old theme of survival and escape, it will leave you wondering if you have what it takes to make it home alive.
In 1651 a young man leaves home for an adventure at sea, shipwrecked on an island 40 miles out, he spends the next 28 years gathering food, resources, tools, and battling against insurmountable odds to stay alive. He hunts, raises animals, reads the bible, and begins to turn his focus and attention inward. His faith grows and he becomes a man of God, learning to accept his fate, growing spiritually, and realizing that he has everything he needs to survive and live in peace. 
Combining themes of hope, strength, and resiliency, this strategic, multi-layered game will test your skills in more ways than one, as you navigate through cannibal attacks, deadly storms, and your own inner turmoil.   




The deck is shuffled, and every player is dealt five cards face down. These cards represent the players’ food supply, with one card being equal to one day's worth of food.  

The game proceeds in a clockwise direction and includes two phases of play during each player’s turn - the exploration phase, and the market phase.
During the exploration phase the active player draws cards from the deck in order to take either food cards or camp cards. The market phase opens for other players once the active player has chosen what card to take.

At the beginning of every turn, a player must discard one food card into the discard pile. This is the cost of playing the game and represents one day's food supply being used up. 
Players take turns flipping cards to find the resources they need. You can think of each flipped card as a new resource or ability your character has uncovered. 

During the exploration phase the active player draws cards from the deck in order to take either food cards or camp cards. The market phase opens for other players once the active player has chosen what card to take.

During the exploration phase a player can flip up to 10 cards. The aim of the exploration phase is to find food and resources and to build the camp and character. Ultimately the goal is to escape from the island. 
After a maximum of ten cards have been flipped, the active player chooses which card(s) they are going to keep, leaving the remaining cards on the table for the other players to buy. 
There are two ways to take cards from the drawn cards
1) Harvest food cards i.e cards with a green palm tree symbol on the top left and a food icon on the bottom right. When harvesting, take the indicated amount of food from the draw deck and place the food card on the discard pile.
2) Take camp cards such as 

construction cards with a brown upper left corner symbol, 
character cards with a blue upper left corner symbol, or 
resource cards with upper left corner green palm tree symbol, other than food cards (if you meet the requirements). 


The camp can consist of items like a hut, palisade, box or boat, as well as resources such as a rifle, an axe or gunpowder. Character growth and actual character cards are also placed in the camp. When a player builds an item in their camp, the card is placed image side up on the table in front of the player. 
A player can continue flipping cards until either:

 they have flipped a total of ten cards, in which case the player is forced to decide what card to take, or 
they decide to stop and take some of the flipped cards to their camp, or alternatively harvest food when the food card is discarded and food cards are taken from the draw deck, or
they flip a total of two threat cards and cannot defeat the more difficult one



If a second threat card is flipped, the player must then defeat the greater of the two threats (denoted by 1, 2, or 3 skulls in the top right corner of the card) if they want to take some flipped card(s) from the table to their camp. 

The threat is defeated by having the cards listed on the card’s ""requirement row"". Each card has its own symbol. In the above example, the player does not have any cards in their camp, so the exploration turn is over for that player and they do not get to keep any of the cards they have flipped.  

If the player is able to defeat the threat, the card is placed on the discard pile, and they can either continue the exploration phase and drawing cards, or
take the indicated amount of food cards and add them to their pile. The options available after defeating the threat are visible on the bottom of the card where there is either a card deck icon OR a food icon with a number. 

  In this example food can be harvested as it has no requirements.  


When building a construction unit like a boat using an axe and wood, the wood is discarded (it has the finite symbol '1') while the axe is not discarded (it has the infinite symbol ∞). 

After each player has done his exploration turn, the market phase starts. Moving in a clockwise direction, all other players are now given the opportunity to buy any cards that are left from the exploration phase. 
The cost of each card is denoted by a number in the top right corner, which represents the number of food cards the buying player must then discard to acquire the card. On top of this number, the buying player must also give one food card to the selling player.
If there is no number in the top right corner (as with the goat card) then the buying player does not need to discard any food cards, but they do still need to give the selling player one food card as payment.  
The market phase continues until all the cards have been bought or the players do not want to buy any more. Any cards left on the table at the end of the market phase are then placed in the discard pile. 

It will take more than just food and shelter to keep you alive. Players will need to teach, pray, and read to build up character, and better the odds of escaping alive. By collecting character growth cards, a player can get characters, which give effects and open up paths to victory. 

Characters are needed to enable the following paths to victory

Beacon Campfire victory path, either with the Man of God character card or with a camp of 18 victory points 
Escape the Island victory path, either with the Teacher character card or with a camp of 18 victory points 
Victory point strategy, by having the Wise Man character plus 25/20/17 VPs (4/3/2 players) 

You could draw the attention of a rescue ship, but you will need to become a Man of God OR build a camp with at least 18 VPs and find wood and gunpowder to build a fire.   
You can set your sights on building a boat, but you will need to find Friday and teach him how to help you.  
Finally, you can pray and read to become a wise man and build up your victory points to beat the other players.   

The game ends in either of the following situations:

When the draw deck has been played through twice, in which case the player with the most victory points (VPs) wins.
When any player achieves one of the three winning strategies: Beacon Campfire, Escape the Island or Victory points.





Our campaign has already reached its goal in Kickstarter, so the product is ready for production in November 2019 and the game ships in January 2020.
The benefits of backing this campaign include much faster access to the game and roughly 25% savings compared to the retail cost. With high quality art and a compact and sturdy box! Take it with you wherever you go and enjoy it for many years to come.

While we are doing everything we can to manage any logistical issues, there is a potential for problems to arise during the manufacturing process. Such issues could impact our ability to meet our backer commitments. These may include (but are not limited to):
* Production delays 
* Shipping and customs related delays
However, we employ a professional manufacturing and fulfillment partner who has done similar campaigns before, so every aspect related to manufacturing and fulfillment will be handled in the best possible way. 
Delivery dates
All announced delivery dates are estimates. While we are doing everything we can to mitigate these risks, backers may receive their rewards at different times depending on their location and the exact reward items selected.  
Subject to changes
Final product will be subject to changes and improvements from what is presented here. 
Deliveries
All parcels that we ship out are boxed, insulated and packaged in a way that should withstand normal bumps during transit. In very uncommon cases where there are damages to the product itself, we will assist in the investigation as to where and how the product was damaged. 
Every package leaving our manufacturer's facility is carefully inspected and they guarantee the goods to be free of defects and manufacturing errors. 
We will give you a full refund, no questions asked within 14 days of the campaign end and upon request. 
Returns
If you find any quality issues with your order, please contact us within 3 days from the arrival date. 
If your game arrives with missing or damaged parts, provide us with appropriate proof and we will substitute them once we have verified the damage.
We will not accept complaints related to the game box contents of this campaign (missing components, damaged components, etc.) that are coming after 30 days from the delivery date to your door.
Mistakes in deliveries
If the game fails to arrive because of the mistake made by the backer (wrong address, recipient absent, failure to pick up at courier/postal warehouse, etc.), any additional shipping/warehousing cost for us to re-send/re-deliver your game will be at backer's expense. This also includes the costs associated with returning the game. If after investigation it becomes clear that the error was on our part, we will resend your package at our expense.
Additional information

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>Potential risks and challenges: Having extensively evaluated the challenges and opportunities inherent in similar Kickstarter projects, Classicbot founder, Philip Lee, is 100% committed to iBoy’s success! A proven manufacturing partner: Classicbot began working with its production partner factory in 2017 and has consistently been praised for exceptional product quality. The headquarter of the factory is located in Hong Kong people so we work closely together all the time. The effect of the Coronavirus Of course, no one can estimate how the virus will affect everyone. But we have built a lot of buffer in our delivery time. Since the mold is finished, we only need two months for production after the funds arrive. Supposedly we can ship everything in July. But we want to give ourselves a 4 months buffer for any unexpected event. At this moment the factory has reopened and started production in a cautious manner. Order fulfillment processes: Having long added to his small design team’s effectiveness by leveraging the superior shipping and delivery facilities of renowned fulfillment centers, Philip is confident distribution will never be a problem. Design and molding: iBoy has been designed as a single unit and tooling for its master mold is done. All the company needs to fast-track into full-scale production is to secure funding to finish the mold and cover production costs.</p>

</div></div>","Remember when the iconic MP3 players first came out, and we were so excited about carrying a thousand songs in our pocket? Here is a toy figure that will make you feel nostalgic about that time
 
Say Hello to iBoy




 
A heartfelt homage to the must-have device that transformed everyone's listening habits in the early 2000s, iBoy toy figure is the brainchild of  Classicbot’s designer, Philip Lee. The end result is an eye-catching talking point that’s sure to brighten up homes and offices everywhere. 
 


 
iBoy doesn't play any music, but it is still lots of fun. 
iBoy is 100% free of electronic parts or functions, but each iBoy’s arms and legs with magnetic joints are infinite fun to move around and play with.  
Magnetic joints


 
 



There’s even a detachable lifelike headphone that ensures effortless switches between the unit’s robot and MP3 stylings.
 
Transformable

iBoy comes with mock-up wire and headphones. So you can display iBoy in different ways.
 
 
Two color options

iBoy comes with two colors. The regular one with the white body. And the 2U Special Edition with the black and red body. They are of the same price. So you can just decide the number of iBoy you want to back and decide the color later. 

 
The perfect fiddle toy 

Each unit comes with an easily rotatable control wheel and easy-on-the-ear clickable button, making it the perfect fiddle toy. Pick it up when you’re bored or stressed!

Unit backs are beautifully chromed while all white parts are finished in durable glossy paint. Each unit’s buttons will also reward owners with a satisfying click and post-press bounce back. Besides looking and feeling every bit as sophisticated as a real MP3 player, iBoy also incorporates a metal weight that gives it the satisfyingly substantial and sturdy feeling shared by all quality toys.

Manufacturing
Since 2017, we have worked with the same reliable factory that adheres to our high quality standards and delivers our products in the most timely manner. We will continue to work with this factory to ensure iBoy with the same high quality.
 
Shipping and delivery:
To ensure prompt and timely delivery, all orders will be shipped worldwide via the Hong Kong postal office’s fast and easily trackable E-express service. We will ship in November. While exact delivery times will vary from country to country, shipments will usually reach US customers within 7 to 14 working days.

<p><strong>Burglar is a whole new twist on family board games.  </strong></p>
<p>It's a game involving skill, chance, memory and tactics as you hunt for loot and get the chance to block opponents from reaching their own target items or escaping undetected.</p>
<p>The game board and tiles themselves have the simple elegance of 1920s sophistication and it's one of those games that's simple to learn but different every time you play.</p>
<p>It's a family friendly game that lasts around 30 minutes which gets more devious every time  as you learn tactics to frustrate opponents and use your best negotiating skills to gang up on players.</p>
</div><div>

<p><strong>What's in the box....</strong></p>
<p>The board - which is a plan view of a sumptuous country manor house living room.</p>
<p>18 valuable ""target"" cards - which clearly identify the items you're looking for.</p>
<p>18 valuable cards and 2 dog tiles -  which are hidden in the room at the start of game play.</p>
<p>7 furniture tiles - which are moved around by players during the game.</p>
<p>6 people counters</p>

</div><div>
<p><strong>How do you play...</strong></p>
<p>In essence it's a simple turn taking game.  But the skill is in remembering where your objects are and in blocking your opponents.  </p>
<p>How good are your friends poker faces when their valuable is found?  Can you move the furniture to make it as awkward as possible to get to their targets while making it as easy as possible to get to yours or escape?</p>
<p>It's a little addictive and children love it because it's so easy to understand.</p>
<p><strong>Taking a turn</strong></p>
<p>· Youngest goes first</p>
<p>· Roll the dice and move your playing piece around the room. You may not land on or jump over furniture. You can move up, down, left,right, or diagonally.</p>
<p>· If you roll a 1 or 2, you can either move 1 or 2 squares, or move an item of furniture (see below).</p>
<p>· If you land on a treasure tile, turn it over for all the players to see.</p>
<p>     - If it’s a piece of treasure you’re trying to collect, show your ‘Burglar’ tile to the other players, and remove the treasure tile from the board. Keep the treasure tile with your burglar tile and leave your Burglar tile face up in front of you to show that you’ve found it.</p>
<p>    - If it’s not a piece of treasure you’re trying to collect, turn it back over and leave it in the same place on the board.</p>
<p>· Play then passes clockwise to the next player.</p>

<p>· Turn the guard dog tile back over but put it back in a different place on the board (this can’t be on top of furniture, another treasure tile, or another player).</p>

<h3><strong>Hello, My Name is Samuel</strong></h3>
<p>I am a game designer who has been designing a board game called Void: Planets Unbound for about 5 years now. Even as a kid, I would always be inventing and imagining board and card games to play with my friends and parents. I have been spending the majority of my adulthood creating a game experience that I have always felt was missing from the market. However, along with the freedom of adulthood came the responsibilities, meaning that I have had to place my passion on the back burner.    </p>
<p>Then, I had an idea! Why don't I just give away my artwork online for donations in the form of unique trading cards? It's perfect! I can do what I love everyday and make more board games.</p>
<p>That's where you come in.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>I am attempting to raise $500 to pay for prototyping costs for my board game. Whenever you donate you will be helping me come closer to finally releasing my game!</p>
<p>You can choose from the following: Single Card Pack for $5 donations, Triple Card Pack for $12 donations, or the Five Card Pack for $20 donations. </p>
<p>Each pack of cards will include a number of unique hand drawn trading cards, depicting scenes as far away as distant planets to landscapes in medieval kingdoms. Some cards will belong to sets, allowing you to trade with other unique trading card enthusiasts to complete the sets and add some extra value to your collection. With every card hand drawn, you can always be sure that you will be discovering something new with each one.</p>
<p>Please note: All cards are blank on the back signed and dated. However, if you would like me to inscribe a custom message, please let me know. </p>

<p>Thank you for your interest. By donating you are allowing me to do what I love everyday and getting me much closer to releasing my first board game.</p>

<p>If you don't have money now, don't worry! You can still help by sharing this page with anybody who might be interested. I am so grateful to everyone for their time and donations! Thank you for allowing me to live my dream. It is all thanks to you.</p>

<p>Hello and thank you for taking the time to look at our campaign for our game called Card Quest. We're Full Combo Gaming and are currently working on adding the finishing touches to our game and we would love your help.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are a small indie game development company who enjoy playing a variety of games ranging from table top RPGs, Board games and card games. We also enjoy coming up with new ideas and using our imagination and critical thinking skills to create fun mechanics, games and worlds for people to explore.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Card Quest is a Multiplayer co-op card game where players explore a dungeon filled with monsters, loot and a nasty boss at the end. Work together and you will surely prevail.</p>
<p> </p>

</div></div>","Hello and thank you for taking the time to look at our campaign for our game called Card Quest. We're Full Combo Gaming and are currently working on adding the finishing touches to our game and we would love your help.
 
We are a small indie game development company who enjoy playing a variety of games ranging from table top RPGs, Board games and card games. We also enjoy coming up with new ideas and using our imagination and critical thinking skills to create fun mechanics, games and worlds for people to explore.
 
Card Quest is a Multiplayer co-op card game where players explore a dungeon filled with monsters, loot and a nasty boss at the end. Work together and you will surely prevail.

Varying difficulty based on the number of players in the game. Variances include monster stats, number of monsters spawned as well as boss mechanics.
An event deck that randomly generates your encounters so each game offers a different experience.

Its unlikely founder was none other than a powerful gnomish wizard with a great enthusiasm for alchemy, but new patrons will be pleased to discover that no concoction was actually mixed inside of an old gnome's washroom, and on the contrary this place has the widest variety of beverages on its menu outside of the most accommodating pubs in the melting pot of a planar metropolis.

When an old friend of his brought his apprentices to meet Strekoz, a surprise revelation sparked an unexpected desire to share a round of drinks. However, they were disappointed to discover the nearest tavern closed after an explosive incident left it filled with armed guards trying to investigate. Without the most suitable spells prepared for fast travel to a farther location, Strekoz decided to bring everyone back to his home and use what he had on hand.  Mixing a curious combination of agents, the gnome prepared everyone beers made from scratch in a remarkably swift amount of time-- it was alcoholic and smelled convincingly like beer, but it was a clever imitation that spent no time brewing in any bottle or keg. For casual drinkers like his guests however, it was an amazing trick they greatly admired.</p><p>Strekoz's old friend would return but a few days later with other acquaintances wishing to show them what the gnomish alchemist could do, and while impressed with his instant beer, the halfling beguiler with them preferred fruity drinks to beer. Accepting the challenge, Strekoz used a new combination of ingredients and reagents on hand to make a similar fake. Now intrigued, his guests were now placing requests, challenging him to imitate all of their favorite refreshments.  Soon he'd attracted a troublesome infamy as word spread of this talent, between people wanting to see how it was done and others wanting drinks that weren't locally available.  Fortunately, Strekoz had documented the formulas he'd used, because when the popularity of his parlor tricks became a nuisance that both depleted precious supplies and interfered with the research he wanted to be doing, he tasked an apprentice with using such recipes to humor his unwanted ""patrons"" for a fee.

It is designed and optimized for two to three players who enjoy exciting tactical matches in everchanging asymmetric faction wars.The game doesn't belong to a big publisher but thanks to a crowdfunding campaign ""a man and his dog"" were able to release WARIGIN in 2018. All units from the original campaign are sent to the initial backers already.Via Indiegogo Indemand you now have the chance to order the exclusive First Edition in a beautiful hand-stamped box with lovingly hand-branded meeples.A tabletop board game with additional card game mechanics, WARIGIN is perfect for a quick blast or an extended all-night session: WARIGIN generates long term excitement with its combination of fast-paced matches, high replayability and cross-match scoring.  Every match in WARIGIN begins with a short bidding sequence to determine the challenger. He will - in exchange for unique advantages - lead his troops as an aggressor against the numerically superior defenders:With a smart combination of hidden movements, powerful action cards and the exploitation of global events it is each player’s goal to conquer an opponent’s fortress in this asymmetric scenario.WARIGIN - First Edition is delivered in a beautiful black box embossed with a deep black stamp.This micro edition consists of high quality game materials (e.g. playing cards by ASS Altenburger) and is also manually improved: The heavyweight wooden hero meeples receive their concealed iron-branding in the same place as where I lovingly stamp and hand pack the boxes... my apartment.The game contains everything that you need to enjoy WARIGIN as it is meant to be played:  - 48 battle cards - 36 action cards including 12 elite cards - 33 heavy wooden meeples (18 soldiers, 15 iron-branded heroes) - 19 event cards - 3 faction cards - 3 game process overview cards - 2 8-sided dice - the manual - the board (high quality hex shaped acrylic glass board ~23.5cm)Game design, illustration and manufacturing (except the US dice) has all been completed in Germany and I am proud to deliver Made in Germany quality to all players!  Please note that pictures in other sections of this page and in the video might show an old prototype which used different materials (e.g. the board received an upgrade to acrylic glass). In addition, the card design was recently improved based on player feedback (a larger illustration with a smaller edge, for example). The final version of the heavyweight wooden meeples are each 29mm in size while the cards are 59x92mm.  You can find all reviews, interviews, let's plays and explanations here (most of them in German currently - sorry).Stefan, Boardgame Digger:""Great, quick game! (...)It is obvious that this game is ready! (...)I think that it mixes things together in a great way!""Martin, Austrian Board Gamer:  ""Pure excitement. This game is for Eternity.""Michael, BrettspieleN Köln""What an asskicking game and the creator is a great guy! It feels like a perfect 3 player PVP game designed by a Skat player!""
Michael, game designer of ""Rob'n'Run""""WARIGIN is a very enjoyable game with simple rules and a short but intense play time.The battle mechanism is my favourite. Congratulations to Christian for this great first project."" WARIGIN is illustrated by Anna Kersten, one of my favorite fantasy artists. Her dark style truly brings the Eternal War between Heaven, Hell and the Void to life and makes WARIGIN a wonderful piece of art: Thank you Anna!All illustrations - card graphics, board design etc - are based on hand painted ink skribbles before Anna digitizes and polishes them to guarantee WARIGIN’s unique look and feel.While many PVP-oriented board games don't work very well with three factions (not at all or only with mediocre rule adjustments), in WARIGIN the inevitable 2 vs 1 situation is the perfect driving force for an asymmetric game design:As a player you want to be the challenger and to fight alone against the combined enemy armies as often as possible - it is the route to exclusive perks and superior elite action cards... and the most efficient way of leading the inter-match, eternal ranking.  Are you strong enough to challenge the other factions or do you forge an unholy alliance to minimize losses in the current match?  It might be a tiny victory point at the end of the evening that makes all the difference!While in a three player match the challenger is up against the two other players, the two player setup represents another, very tough duel situation for both sides: When the second player gains control over the third faction and receives additional action cards every turn, the challenger is not only outnumbered against a better coordinated army but he must also fight against time.If you are interested in checking out the rules in full you can find them here.In addition, there are videos available here which explain the rules and show a complete match. While WARIGIN is very easy to learn (you can jump right into the action within minutes thanks to the beginner scenario), it needs a lot of experience to master: With millions of potential starting hands and variable player strategies every match plays out differently: Although you know your own action cards and units (and after a while you might even anticipate which cards you are up against), events and enemy troops remain concealed until it might be too late.While the original combat system uses dice for really(!) quick matches (15 minutes once you know the cards), I created - with the help of the community - a second, card based combat system: Although it takes a little bit more time the card system’s advantages include additional bluffing and tactical choices.As I promised a complete game without any add-ons, the additional card deck, including the combat cards, is part of the First Edition, too.  Due to the potential for very quick matches, the competitive bidding process, and the inter-match scoring system, WARIGIN is great for extended game sessions with multiple matches: Thanks to years of testing, no player who overplays his cards will win constantly. However, an aggressive approach with an above average starting hand remains the key to dominating eternity!The offered perk contains the complete WARIGIN - First Edition.I believe that you should encounter the full game experience if you choose to support my dream! Unfortunately WARIGIN doesn't offer any gameplay related Stretchgoals and add ons because everything required for the best gaming experience is already included in the box. :)I tried to come up with a simple shipping cost model and the result is as follows:Shipping costs are already included with all pledge levels. Please note:In general I'll ship your game within three days after your order (from December 1st, 2018).Because I do this project alone there might be a small delay if I am abroad.If you want to receive updates please follow WARIGIN on Twitter or subscribe to my Newsletter.For all discussions about Warigin (either with other players or with me) visit WARIGIN on Facebook or Board Game Geek.If you are a Let's Player, board game café or editor who is interested in WARIGIN please contact me directly via email: contact@3-headed-dog.com I will do my best to deliver a great WARIGIN experience to you.Thank you very much for your support! Legal NoticePrivacy PolicyWARIGIN ist ein konfliktorientiertes, schnelles Brettspiel. Es ist optimiert für zwei bis drei Spieler, die spannende taktische Herausforderungen in sich stets ändernden, asymmetrischen Fraktionskriegen suchen.Das Spiel gehört keinem großen Verlag, sondern durfte dank einer Crowdfunding-Kampagne von ""einem Mann und seinem Hund"" in 2018 veröffentlicht werden.Alle Einheiten aus der Ursprungskampagne sind bereits an die Unterstützer versandt.Via Indiegogo Indemand hast du jetzt die Chance, die exklusive Erstauflage in einer wunderschönen, gestempelten Box und mit liebevoll gebrandmarkten Holzfiguren zu bestellen.Als Brettspiel mit zusätzlichen Kartenspielelementen ist WARIGIN sowohl für das schnelle Spiel zwischendurch als auch für lange Spieleabende geeignet: Mit der Kombination aus schnellen Runden, hohem Wiederspielwert und spielübergreifendem Wertungssystem erzeugt WARIGIN langfristig Spannung.In WARIGIN startet jedes Spiel mit einer schnellen Bietsequenz, um den Herausforderer zu bestimmen. Dieser führt - im Austausch für einzigartige Vorteile - seine Truppen alleine gegen die zahlenmäßig überlegenen Feinde. Mit einer klugen Kombination aus verdeckten Bewegungen, mächtigen Aktionskarten und Ausnutzen globaler Ereignisse ist es das Spielziel in dieser ungleichen Ausgangslage, die gegnerische Festung zu erobern.Die WARIGIN-Erstauflage wird in einer schönen schwarzen Box mit einem tiefschwarzen Stempel versehen geliefert.Die Kleinstauflage besteht aus hochwertigen Spielmaterialien (z.B. Spielkarten von ASS Altenburger), wird aber zusätzlich manuell bearbeitet:Die Helden aus massiven Holzfiguren erhalten ihre verdeckte Wertigkeit am gleichen Ort, an dem ich auch die Boxen liebevoll stempel und per Hand packe... in meiner Wohnung.Das Spiel enthält alles, was du zum WARIGIN spielen benötigst:  - 48 Kampfkarten - 36 Aktionskarten inklusive 12 Elitekarten- 33 massive Holzfiguren (18 Soldaten, 15 Helden mit Brandzeichen)- 19 Ereigniskarten- 3 Fraktionskarten- 3 Übersichtskarten- 2 8-seitige Würfel - die Spielanleitung- das Spielbrett (hochwertiges hexförmiges Acrylglas-Brett ~23,5cm)WARIGIN ist zu 100% in Deutschland erfunden, illustriert und hergestellt (mit Ausnahme der US-Würfel) und ich bin stolz, allen Spielern Qualität Made in Germany zu liefern! Bitte beachtet, dass Bilder in anderen Abschnitten und im Video teilweise einen alten Prototypen mit anderen Spielmaterialien zeigen (z.B. hat das Spielbrett ein Upgrade auf Acrylglas bekommen), zudem wurde kürzlich das Kartendesign basierend auf Spielerfeedback angepasst (bedeutet: größere Illustrationen und kleinerer Kartenrand).Die massiven Holzfiguren haben eine Höhe von 29mm, während die Karten 59x92mm groß sind.Ihr findet alle Interviews, Let's Plays und ein Erklärvideo hier.Stefan, Boardgame Digger: ""Großartiges, schnelles Spiel!

<h3>It's Finally Here!</h3>
<p>Enter the Magical Realm of <i>Quintangled</i>, a unique and inspiring board game of Strategy, Chance, and the mysterious element of Destiny! Not a game of war or domination, Quintangled is a thoughtful experience that offers a metaphor for life's universal journey.</p>
<p>Channel your inner hero and quench your thirst for adventure as you explore the enchanted World of <i>Quintangled</i>.  Every game experience will be different as you navigate the many opportunities and encounter twists of Fate that will craft a different outcome each time you play. This game is a fun experience that is a metaphor for the universal journey of life that transcends time and culture. In <i>Quintangled</i>, as in life, we are the ones who must become heroic and save the world. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1517691378/gitby26kebzppwsu1g2w.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/></p>
<p>Begin by rolling the eight-sided die to determine the Character you will assume: Knight, Lover, Jester, Healer, Dreamer, Sage, Monarch, or Priestess. Journey to The Wizard's Castle, meet the Wizard, and receive Magical Aid.</p>

<p>Step onto your chosen path to begin your adventure. The game’s unique two-part structure challenges players to see how choice changes everything and motives can make all the difference. Along the way, you'll meet Oracles of Wisdom, helpers and hinderers, and encounter perils and pitfalls. You will learn how choices, random quirks of Fate, and the landscape of the game impact your character's destiny. In the first half of the game, your character will traverse the winding paths of the World of <i>Quintangled</i> as you visit all four element corners and perform your Shadow Act. You will then enter The Abyss, obtain your character's talisman of power, meet your animal ally, and perform Heroic Feats as you prepare to journey home.  You will also encounter unexpected aid, gain wisdom, and earn points to become heroic and fulfill your character's quest.</p>

Each game character must accomplish particular tasks and gather wisdom along the way as they travel their path to return home. As you and your fellow players vie to win the game, success is largely a function of your choices, your chosen strategy, the opportunities presented by your rolls of the die, and the elements of Fate and Magical Aid.</p>

Most of the time the game just facilitated killing monsters and taking the loot.I was inspired by a few action games that have come out in the recent years. One, where every step you take while in combat needs to be considered to the end, or you’ll end up getting hurt, the game encouraging the player to bide their time. The other, a game about going after monsters, fighting them in fast-paced battles, and yet respect the nature presented. Both of these games exist, yet there wasn’t anything like them on the tabletop. To create something new, to create something that would aid in the stories I would like to tell and play. The thrill of the hunt, preparation for a quest, meticulous planning, blood pumping action. Those are what drives the creation and gameplay of Slayer's Frontier onwards.- Joonas Lind, designer: Slayer's FrontierIn Slayer's Frontier, the player takes on the role of a hunter, a mix of warrior and scholar, and venture out onto the frontier to confront and slay a variety of creatures, most larger than life.Your choices matter. Not every foe is defeatable by brute force alone, but require some choice equipment or cunning tactic of action to be taken down. And the stronger foes you face and conquer, the stronger materials you'll be able to get to create stronger equipment to face even stronger foes. Hunting monsters like the bizarre Stormcaller, the mountainlike Sierra Dragon Turtle or other tough creatures and exploring the world of untrodden lands are at the core of Slayer's Frontier. Slayer's Frontier rules can be used to play in a variety of fantasy settings, but the book also comes with the setting of Elerest, a formerly lustrous and thriving world of high fantasy, now in a state of lull due to an apocalyptic event in the past.Now reset, with remnants of the ancient civilizations hidden away in ruins and the far reaches of the land and inadvertently guarded by a variety of creatures, some never before seen. Explore the land of Elerest, be it for searching new exotic creatures to make a new fancy set of gear, or delve into the ancient past to find what was lost and why in the ancient past. The book will be available in PDF and Print-on-Demand formats supported by DriveThruRPG, all in full color. The book itself will be roughly 250 pages, including all the rules you need to play, and the setting of Elerest. The game presented in this campaign will have a page size of A4.Almost the entire ruleset has been written and is being playtested, and the writing, layout, and art production prior to delivering is well underway. The current release date will be by the end of July 2018. The game will be delivered using DriveThruRPG in all of the presented formats.The team behind Slayer's Frontier is an up-start tabletop game publisher Wooden Cauldron.Joonas Lind - Designer and writer. Joonas is a Finnish marketing content creator with a decade-long tenure as a tabletop RPG game master. Slayer's Frontier is his first design to be released.Otso Päiväniemi - Artist. Otso is one of those strange artists who learned how to stop comparing himself to other artists and embrace the endless mastering of his own style.

The game's rules are almost finalized and are being playtested. We would like to work for the game with every minute of the day, but that is not possible yet - so the team is working part-time on the game. Delays, though currently unlikely, can occur due to time being taken by other occupations. The game also is the first game created by Wooden Cauldron, and thus, unforeseen challenges may arise.  Why is this campaign on IndieGoGo and not Kickstarter? We're operating from Finland, and Kickstarter is not an option here for legal reasons. Because of this, we had to opt for Indiegogo.Want to have a try and see how the game plays in person? Our playtest is still ongoing, and you can find it here.You can find us and up-to-date news about the game on the following pages:

<h3>Where it all started </h3>
<p>I wanted to find a way to get people to converse more so that they have a better understanding of the person the consider close to them.  Even in my own personal life, I feel like I'm close to some people that in all actuality...I may not even know that well..sounds weird right?</p>
<p>So I thought, maybe I could make a game that would help people to learn new things and maybe revisit old things about either their best friend or romantic partner. This game will make you listen and truly try to understand you partner a little more, thus helping the relationship grow and have a little healthy competition with other people as well.</p>

<h3>What is CoupleUp?</h3>
<p>CoupleUp is a exciting party card game geared toward bringing those you feel closest to you, even closer through thought provoking and eye opening questions that will bring you joy while answering.  There are four categories of cards with specific questions or phrases that pertain to you that must be answered by your partner. Each question has points on the bottom depending on the difficulty of the question.</p>
<p>Make your way  through the cards answering some easy, maybe hard and other revealing questions about your partner that you may or may not know. <strong>The team with the most points at the end of the round wins the game!</strong></p>

</div></div>","Where it all started 
I wanted to find a way to get people to converse more so that they have a better understanding of the person the consider close to them.  Even in my own personal life, I feel like I'm close to some people that in all actuality...I may not even know that well..sounds weird right?
So I thought, maybe I could make a game that would help people to learn new things and maybe revisit old things about either their best friend or romantic partner. This game will make you listen and truly try to understand you partner a little more, thus helping the relationship grow and have a little healthy competition with other people as well.

 
What is CoupleUp?
CoupleUp is a exciting party card game geared toward bringing those you feel closest to you, even closer through thought provoking and eye opening questions that will bring you joy while answering.  There are four categories of cards with specific questions or phrases that pertain to you that must be answered by your partner. Each question has points on the bottom depending on the difficulty of the question.
Make your way  through the cards answering some easy, maybe hard and other revealing questions about your partner that you may or may not know. The team with the most points at the end of the round wins the game!
 
HOW TO PLAY!
 

Players will divide themselves into team of two players each and place the four decks of cards on the playing surface logo side up.
 

One player from a team will roll the die and pick up the card that corresponds with what was rolled.
 

The player that rolled the die will read the card then answer on a sheet of paper within 20 seconds. After 10 seconds your partner must answer with what they think you wrote down.
 

If they get the answer correct, that team will be rewarded the amount of points on the bottom of the card. Keep the cards you answer in a discard pile for your team. Repeat this step until all players have gone 5 times.
 

 
The team with the most points at the end of the round wins the game!

<p>Mejorar el bienestar de la población sin que se dispare el consumo de recursos naturales y las emisiones que contribuyen al cambio climático: éste es el mayor desafío que enfrenta la humanidad, y es el que deberás asumir al jugar ECOPOLIS!</p>

<h3>ECOPOLIS <u>no</u> es un juego de trivia, es un juego de toma de decisiones sobre políticas de país.</h3>
<p><strong>Objetivo de juego</strong>: Ser el primer país en llegar a la meta, un espacio en el tablero donde el Desarrollo Humano es muy alto, y el Consumo de Recursos Naturales es muy bajo (sostenible). </p>
<p><i>Se trata esencialmente de una carrera hacia el desarrollo verdaderamente sostenible...</i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1545087825/ckwgti1fyum8v1pqhazl.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>¿Cómo jugar?</strong></h3>
<p>El tablero de ECOPOLIS funciona como una cuadrícula donde te puedes mover en cualquier sentido: arriba-abajo representa el nivel de Consumo de Recursos, e izquierda-derecha el nivel de Desarrollo Humano. </p>
<p>Para avanzar hacia la meta deberás invertir tu <strong>ingreso nacional </strong>en diferentes cartas de <strong>Política Pública </strong>que están a tu disposición. ¿Construir más carreteras?  ¿Aumentar la escolarización?  ¿Promover las energías renovables? ¿Incrementar el turismo?... Cada una de estas políticas tendrá efectos únicos sobre tus niveles de Desarrollo Humano y Consumo de Recursos<strong> </strong>(acercándote o alejándote de la meta).</p>

<p>ECOPOLIS fue creado en Panamá por Andrés Tarté, luego de madurar por mucho tiempo una idea que le dio su padre: ""la gente no está captando la importancia de este asunto, ¿por qué no diseñamos un juego para crear conciencia sobre el desarrollo sostenible?"" </p>
<p>La resultante dinámica de juego es 100% original e imita lo que suele ocurrir cuando los países navegan el camino de su desarrollo. Esta dinámica fue obtenida gracias a un análisis estadístico de más de 700 indicadores de desempeño para 140 países.* Así, los jugadores pueden visualizar las conexiones –no siempre obvias– entre diferentes políticas de desarrollo y el bienestar humano, el consumo de recursos naturales y la emisión de gases de efecto invernadero.</p>
<p>La iniciativa fue incubada desde sus inicios por el Centro Internacional para el Desarrollo Sostenible (CIDES) de la Ciudad del Saber.  Posteriormente ha recibido apoyo oficial para su desarrollo de parte del Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo (BID), la Secretaría Nacional de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación (SENACYT), la Universidad Tecnológica de Panamá (UTP) y el Ministerio de Ambiente de Panamá (MiAMBIENTE).</p>

</div></div>","Eres un gobernante que quiere lo mejor para su país: salud, educación, ingreso, equidad... 
Al mismo tiempo, ves cómo en todo el mundo las actividades humanas están acabando con los recursos naturales y acelerando el cambio climático.  Sabes que no podemos seguir así, pero ¿qué puedes hacer?
Mejorar el bienestar de la población sin que se dispare el consumo de recursos naturales y las emisiones que contribuyen al cambio climático: éste es el mayor desafío que enfrenta la humanidad, y es el que deberás asumir al jugar ECOPOLIS!

Número de jugadores: 2-5
Edades: 10+
Duración: 60 minutos
______________________________________________________

ECOPOLIS no es un juego de trivia, es un juego de toma de decisiones sobre políticas de país.
Objetivo de juego: Ser el primer país en llegar a la meta, un espacio en el tablero donde el Desarrollo Humano es muy alto, y el Consumo de Recursos Naturales es muy bajo (sostenible). 
Se trata esencialmente de una carrera hacia el desarrollo verdaderamente sostenible...

¿Cómo jugar?
El tablero de ECOPOLIS funciona como una cuadrícula donde te puedes mover en cualquier sentido: arriba-abajo representa el nivel de Consumo de Recursos, e izquierda-derecha el nivel de Desarrollo Humano. 
Para avanzar hacia la meta deberás invertir tu ingreso nacional en diferentes cartas de Política Pública que están a tu disposición. ¿Construir más carreteras?  ¿Aumentar la escolarización?  ¿Promover las energías renovables? ¿Incrementar el turismo?... Cada una de estas políticas tendrá efectos únicos sobre tus niveles de Desarrollo Humano y Consumo de Recursos (acercándote o alejándote de la meta).
La clave está en pensar muy bien antes de decidir qué Política implementar. ¿Aumentará o disminuirá el Desarrollo Humano de tu país?... ¿Hará que la población consuma más o menos Recursos?... Usualmente algo se gana y algo se pierde. Necesitarás toda tu inteligencia eco-lógica y algo de suerte, porque es cierto que las cartas determinan tus probabilidades, pero el resultado final está condicionado por un lanzamiento de los dados (factor de incertidumbre).

En cada turno también tendrás que negociar cooperación internacional con tus oponentes para generar ingresos extra e intentar reducir el consumo global de recursos. Acá, los jugadores interesados en la carta que vas a implementar entran en una guerra de ofertas para poder compartir contigo los beneficios de dicha política.
Además, en ECOPOLIS podrás:
Enfrentar Eventos Inesperados:  Estas son cartas que tomas al azar y que representan eventos que ocurren en tu país sin que los hayas planificado (y sin que te cuesten dinero). Ellas te pueden favorecer (lo más probable), como en el caso de innovaciones tecnológicas, o te pueden perjudicar (a veces), como cuando te golpea un desastre natural o una huelga laboral.

Acumular y usar Cartas de Propulsión: Debes trabajar para obtener estas cartas, las cuales se juegan en combinación con las cartas de Política y mejoran su desempeño (por ejemplo, reduciendo la corrupción gubernamental o aumentando la equidad social).  Algunas de ellas también te darán la opción de declarar la guerra o exportar tu contaminación a otros jugadores...  No es exactamente lo que el planeta necesita, pero -en el contexto de este juego- puede ser muy divertido.

Acumular e intercambiar Eco-créditos: ¿no necesitas bajar tu Consumo en este momento? Obtén eco-créditos y guárdalos para más tarde o negócialos con otros jugadores!
   


 
Breve historia de ECOPOLIS
ECOPOLIS fue creado en Panamá por Andrés Tarté, luego de madurar por mucho tiempo una idea que le dio su padre: ""la gente no está captando la importancia de este asunto, ¿por qué no diseñamos un juego para crear conciencia sobre el desarrollo sostenible?""

<h3>(Game Night Ready)™ Game Libraries</h3>
<p>We only sell games that we love, that we know are great for game nights and parties. You can buy them in regular retail packaging, or packaged with accessories designed to make them... Well, you get the idea.</p>
<p>Tangibly, what that means is that we add things like <strong>premium card protectors</strong>, often in hard-to find-sizes, <strong>lamination</strong> for fragile papers, 'ex libris' labels to mark them as yours, and little things like extra zip-lock baggies, to keep everything organized and protected, and safe from your <strike>filthy</strike> beloved friends and customers.</p>
<p>Beyond individual games, this campaign is all about getting you an entire (Game Night Ready)™ <strong>Game Library</strong> (in a Bag, or in a Box)! It's ideal for a business that wants to host a regular game night for customers, individuals who want to start a game library from scratch, or as a wedding or housewarming gift!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535749400/rfcnx6s7xpgzxojl6hpw.png"" src=""""/><br/> </p>
<h3>TLDR:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>The Fourth Place</strong> makes <strong>game nights in a box</strong>, <strong>game libraries in a bag</strong>, and vice versa.</li>
<li>Each full-size library kit comes with <strong>seven awesome games</strong> and more!</li>
<li>We protect and accessorize the games to make them <strong>(Game Night Ready)™</strong>!</li>
<li>Perks with ""<strong>Business</strong>"" in the name include a kit for success with a public game library and game night events. Other perks (except the non-""Business"" kit) are great for players too.</li>
<li>Support us with a contribution, and get a perk like a<strong> t-shirt</strong>, a<strong> game night in a (smaller) box</strong> or some <strong>stickers</strong>!<br/> </li>
</ul>
<h3>The Fourth Place</h3>
<p>I have always been passionate about spaces for geeks, whether that means small game nights with friends, shops where we can congregate, or huge conventions. I've been comics writer, created LARP events, and run geek-friendly teams at tech startups.</p>
<p>We all have a <strong>Third Place</strong>-- where, after home and work, we feel most comfortable. As a kid, it was the library and then the art room. On TV, we've watched people practically at live Cheers, The Bronze in Sunnydale, or Jitters.</p>
<p><strong>The Fourth Place</strong> takes its name from that sense of being at home, plus some geeky concepts that are close to my heart:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jack Kirby's cosmic comics set in the <strong>Fourth World </strong>
</li>
<li>Tales of Faerie as the <strong>Fourth Realm</strong>, after Earth, Heaven, and Hell</li>
<li>The kind of gaming group where you still have a blast when you get <strong>Fourth Place</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>With your help, places like coffee shops, restaurants, bars, B&amp;Bs, community centers, dorms, and public libraries will be able to create a Fourth Place. Individuals will be able to jump-start their own game collection, or give one to a friend who has discovered games.</p>
<p><strong>The Fourth Place</strong> won't just be hundreds, or thousands, of little places-- it will become somewhere we can always find. <br/> </p>
</div><div>
<ul></ul>
<h3>You Can Help-- and Reap the Rewards!</h3>
<p>Curating a worthwhile game library and getting it (Game Night Ready)™ is a lot of work. Taking that hard work off of peoples' hands, and doing it right, will take time and money.</p>
<p>This campaign will allow us to produce our first round of game libraries, and keep prices down by getting the supplies in bulk. It will also directly get game libraries into the hands of business who will create great spaces, and people who want to share them.</p>
<p>Funding will go to buying the games, card protectors, lamination, promo stickers, owner and player guides, and stuff like markers, that go into each case. Without a campaign like this, buying all of those things at volume would be way beyond my humble budget, so prices would go up.</p>
<p>You will also help us be able to set up our online store, and a monthly subscription service for owners of the starter libraries, so each library can keep getting bigger and better, and the spaces we create with them can welcome more and more people!<br/> </p>
<p><strong><u>What You Get - Game Libraries</u>:</strong></p>
<p>Each full-size game library starts with <strong>seven great tabletop games</strong>, including card games, board games, games for a bunch of players, games for a couple of players, games for adults, games for kids and teens, games for serious players, games for casual players, and everything in between. (Yeah, I've put a lot of thought into those seven games.)</p>
<p>Each game comes <strong>(Game Night Ready)™</strong>, with premium card protectors, laminated papers, an 'Ex Libris' label, and other add-ons like baggies and rubber bands.</p>

<p><strong>Okay, One More:</strong> We're just one man, a cat, and a spokesminion at the moment. If this campaign is a huge success, the margins will get even better, making your rewards safer-- but it may take a bit longer to get everything together. On the other hand, if that happens, I expect to be able to include some extra surprises.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Every Little Bit Counts</h3>
<p>Not everyone is going to be able to set aside a few hundred bucks for a kick*ss <strong>(Game Night Ready)™ Game Library</strong>. Some won't even be able to spare the money for a <strong>Game Night in a (Smaller) Box</strong>, or even a sticker pack. That's cool.</p>
<p>You can help us by donating a few bucks, by telling a friend about our campaign, by asking for one of our libraries or games for your next birthday or major holiday, by posting about the campaign on social media, or even by joining our little community on Facebook.</p>

</div></div>","(Game Night Ready)™ Game Libraries
We only sell games that we love, that we know are great for game nights and parties. You can buy them in regular retail packaging, or packaged with accessories designed to make them... Well, you get the idea.
Tangibly, what that means is that we add things like premium card protectors, often in hard-to find-sizes, lamination for fragile papers, 'ex libris' labels to mark them as yours, and little things like extra zip-lock baggies, to keep everything organized and protected, and safe from your filthy beloved friends and customers.
Beyond individual games, this campaign is all about getting you an entire (Game Night Ready)™ Game Library (in a Bag, or in a Box)! It's ideal for a business that wants to host a regular game night for customers, individuals who want to start a game library from scratch, or as a wedding or housewarming gift!
 
TLDR:


The Fourth Place makes game nights in a box, game libraries in a bag, and vice versa.
Each full-size library kit comes with seven awesome games and more!
We protect and accessorize the games to make them (Game Night Ready)™!
Perks with ""Business"" in the name include a kit for success with a public game library and game night events. Other perks (except the non-""Business"" kit) are great for players too.
Support us with a contribution, and get a perk like a t-shirt, a game night in a (smaller) box or some stickers! 

The Fourth Place
I have always been passionate about spaces for geeks, whether that means small game nights with friends, shops where we can congregate, or huge conventions. I've been comics writer, created LARP events, and run geek-friendly teams at tech startups.
We all have a Third Place-- where, after home and work, we feel most comfortable. As a kid, it was the library and then the art room. On TV, we've watched people practically at live Cheers, The Bronze in Sunnydale, or Jitters.
The Fourth Place takes its name from that sense of being at home, plus some geeky concepts that are close to my heart:

Jack Kirby's cosmic comics set in the Fourth World 

Tales of Faerie as the Fourth Realm, after Earth, Heaven, and Hell
The kind of gaming group where you still have a blast when you get Fourth Place.

With your help, places like coffee shops, restaurants, bars, B&Bs, community centers, dorms, and public libraries will be able to create a Fourth Place. Individuals will be able to jump-start their own game collection, or give one to a friend who has discovered games.
The Fourth Place won't just be hundreds, or thousands, of little places-- it will become somewhere we can always find.  


You Can Help-- and Reap the Rewards!
Curating a worthwhile game library and getting it (Game Night Ready)™ is a lot of work. Taking that hard work off of peoples' hands, and doing it right, will take time and money.
This campaign will allow us to produce our first round of game libraries, and keep prices down by getting the supplies in bulk. It will also directly get game libraries into the hands of business who will create great spaces, and people who want to share them.
Funding will go to buying the games, card protectors, lamination, promo stickers, owner and player guides, and stuff like markers, that go into each case. Without a campaign like this, buying all of those things at volume would be way beyond my humble budget, so prices would go up.
You will also help us be able to set up our online store, and a monthly subscription service for owners of the starter libraries, so each library can keep getting bigger and better, and the spaces we create with them can welcome more and more people! 
What You Get - Game Libraries:
Each full-size game library starts with seven great tabletop games, including card games, board games, games for a bunch of players, games for a couple of players, games for adults, games for kids and teens, games for serious players, games for casual players, and everything in between. (Yeah, I've put a lot of thought into those seven games.)
Each game comes (Game Night Ready)™, with premium card protectors, laminated papers, an 'Ex Libris' label, and other add-ons like baggies and rubber bands.
Every kit comes with a custom The Fourth Place library box, the Gamefolio Vault Duffel Bag, or the full Init Gamefolio system including Gamefolio Cases.
Business kits come with high-quality vinyl promo stickers, guides for the owner and players, and some bonus stuff like markers. We also assemble the games and protectors to make sure they don't sit on your shelf until someone has time. Individual kits slim back on that stuff, but still include some The Fourth Place schwag.
Pricing & Accounting:
Transparency time! You only pay MSRP for games and major accessories, plus our cost for any other accessories and materials, and get Free Shipping to the US and cheap shipping to Canada.
You can help out by buying your own game library, in a snazzy library box or an InIt Gamefolio Vault Duffel Bag or complete GameFolio System, by buying cool perks like a mini game night (two fully-accessorized games, plus one expansion), and with one-of-a-kind The Fourth Place merch to share your love of games and the spaces we create when we play them! If things go well, we can add subscription boxes and comic libraries too! 
Terms & Conditions for Business:
Businesses purchasing any games or game libraries will need to agree to  Terms & Conditions for Businesses. The short version:
Your responsibilities:

Don't resell the games, so we don't lose our reseller agreements.
Use our branding when promoting your game event and library.
Don't schedule opposite our other customers in your area.

Our responsibilities:

Track a calendar of events, to help promote your event and avoid scheduling conflicts.
Limited number of kits per zip code to avoid over-saturation of competition.
Prioritize everyone's success over individual sales.

<h2>Short Summary</h2>
<p>Hi everyone, I'm Clive Robertson, proud father of 2 beautiful girls and the founder and creator of the worlds fastest, funniest active card game.</p>
<p>For over 25 years I have worked as a sports and physical therapist cumulating in working as a Personal Trainer and Sports Therapist, aswell as working for Newcastle United FC.</p>

<p>However, it was my passion for supporting children who had a lack of fundamental play in my previous role,  working with toddler groups, focusing on their health and well being, that led to the creation and need for Snapfit.</p>
<p>I constantly had parents asking me to write down activities to play with their children at home. However, pieces of paper easily get lost and that's when a light bulb moment occurred, to create a simple, portable, accessible, cost effective, fun, active family card game which you can take anywhere and play anywhere.</p>
<p>As a child, my favourite game was snap. I knew we needed to create an atmosphere of  active fun and more importantly where families could meet on a common ground away from  children's tech and parents high priced gym costs along with precious time together. This is where the idea of SNAPFIT was born.</p>
<p>For years, parents have been looking for a fun active intervention to their child's sedentary lifestyle. SNAPFIT is the  answer, giving hilarious fun right here in a box.</p>
<p>The games industry has yet to focus on this concern where a lack of  active play in children has become  such an issue...…..Little Athlete Games have identified this through our range of unique products that will have you and your family laughing well after you have all have  played it.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1571665806/yo2dryo1woargq4kxvd1.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Nothing can be more evident and important to us at Little Athlete Games than statistics showing over 340,000,000 children and adolescents between 5 and 19 years of age who are overweight and obese worldwide and a further 41,000,000 under the age of 5 years old are otherwise the same.</p>
<p>At our Little Athlete Games hub we knew something had to be done with regards to the health and well being of todays children who are locked into a more sedentary lifestyle, ever decreasing attention spans along with increased screen times.</p>
<p>With the increased risk of children's diabetes, breathing problems i.e. asthma , joint problems etc. We knew it was a problem worth helping to solve.....Welcome to the future of gameplay, Welcome to the world of SNAPFIT.....</p>
<p>With your Generous contributions we will be able to extend our product  range of games all of which will be contributing toward active gameplay where we feel will be invaluable to every child's health, fun and wellbeing.</p>
<p>At Little Athlete Games we have also identified that just over 14,000,000 people still locked in poverty across the UK alone gives rise to the lack of resources able to  help inactive families, that alongside ever decreasing green spaces and schools with ever decreasing school budgets given rise to a supplement of choice which is both accessible , cost effective , reliable , and relative.</p>
<p>We are THAT game of choice. An active card game where every child and parent will enjoy our box and where every parent can relate the game as a fun barometer for there child's health and well-being , which is both effective and cost effective.</p>

<h3>How driven minds relax</h3>
<p>I have experienced the debilitating effects of stress and anxiety first-hand over the past 15+ years. You lose your creativity, spontaneity, and any inclination towards risk. Life's boundaries draw inward as every muscle is silently clenched, waiting for the worst to happen. In other words - your ability to dream goes out the window. We need a world of dreamers, people who can see what isn't yet possible and are willing to risk everything to make their dreams a reality.</p>
<p>That's why I started Lemonade Pursuits puzzles. I believe in the mental power of solving a puzzle and the benefits that come from intentional focus, piece by piece. With every piece you place, your mind slowly unwinds, your perspective is renewed, and the impossible becomes possible again. </p>
<p>In pursuit of this mission, our jigsaw puzzles feature art that is not only visually appealing but also uses design elements that foster relaxation, lower blood pressure, and quiet the mind. We produce these puzzles collaboratively with incredibly talented artists and a portion of our sales go back to the contributing artists.</p>
<h3>What makes our puzzles different:</h3>
<p>1) Lemonade Pursuits puzzles feature art that uses design elements to foster relaxation and quiet the mind, such as natural fractals, seascapes, shades of blue, green landscapes and cheerful scenes.</p>
<p>2) Woman-owned. We’re working to even the playing field, one piece at a time.</p>
<p>3) We are collaborating with artists around the world (Susan Nethercote, Rachelle Kearns, Christa Rijneveld, and Andrea Caballero) to create these puzzles. 10% of all revenue goes back to the contributing artists.</p>
<p>4) Unlike most puzzles, Lemonade Pursuits puzzles are designed and manufactured in the U.S. We are proud of the fact that those that produce our puzzles make a living wage and work in good conditions.</p>
<p>5) We want to leave this Earth better than we found it. To achieve this, our puzzles and boxes are produced with recycled chipboard, artwork is printed with soy inks, and the shrink-wrap and plastic bag inside are made of biodegradable plastic.</p>

We have specialist engineers and supply chain managers who used to work on large international projects, so we do not foresee any problems arising for production and fulfillment that we do not have the skills in the team to overcome. We have also joined forces with some of the worlds leading authorities on game fulfillment (Eastar &amp; Quartermaster Logistics) to make sure Grendha: Search For Lost Triumphs has a smooth ride to your door.</p><p>Be aware that this is not a pre-order but IGG for a product that may see some elements of the game components, artwork, and design change between what is presented here and the finished product as we strive to improve the game to the last continuously.</p><p>Our biggest challenge would be any unforeseen events that may delay the project. To that end, we have spent significant time preparing for as many eventualities as possible, but there may always be edge cases that could lead to delays.</p><p>Grendha: SFLT is a large and complex project with many interconnected pieces and potential logistical issues involved. In addition to all of the usual challenges associated with a big board game project (miniature tooling, printing, production, international shipping, etc.), there are the additional challenges involved in writing all of the included artbooks and other content not present in many other board games.</p><p>We will apply all of the knowledge that we have gained and do our best in ensuring that this is not only a successful project but one that is a joy for our backers to participate in. We have developed a reputation as an honest, forthright, and caring company that is active in our community, and we plan to continue building upon that rapport, keeping our backers involved in every step of the process.</p><p>Will problems arise during this process? Of course. But we intend to grow, learn, adapt, and, in the end, deliver a board game that will be a truly compelling experience. Thank you for considering joining this crazy ride with us.</p><p>As per the terms stated on IGG, a full refund will be provided if the request is received within 7 days of the close of the campaign. Otherwise, such a refund will be at our exclusive discretion and will be net of handling costs, IGG commissions and credit card processing fees (15%).</p><p>If you fail to check out and pay for your order, including shipping costs, before the posted payment deadline, you may be forfeiting your products. Unclaimed games will be released after the closing date to online and retail sales since we lose money on unclaimed games due to storage fees.

Risks and challengesThis is Doptale Interactive Incorporation's first game; however, it has been in development for years with a dedicated team of industry professionals who have worked on many other games before. We have specialist engineers and supply chain managers who used to work on large international projects, so we do not foresee any problems arising for production and fulfillment that we do not have the skills in the team to overcome. We have also joined forces with some of the worlds leading authorities on game fulfillment (Eastar & Quartermaster Logistics) to make sure Grendha: Search For Lost Triumphs has a smooth ride to your door.Be aware that this is not a pre-order but IGG for a product that may see some elements of the game components, artwork, and design change between what is presented here and the finished product as we strive to improve the game to the last continuously.Our biggest challenge would be any unforeseen events that may delay the project. To that end, we have spent significant time preparing for as many eventualities as possible, but there may always be edge cases that could lead to delays.Grendha: SFLT is a large and complex project with many interconnected pieces and potential logistical issues involved. In addition to all of the usual challenges associated with a big board game project (miniature tooling, printing, production, international shipping, etc.), there are the additional challenges involved in writing all of the included artbooks and other content not present in many other board games.We will apply all of the knowledge that we have gained and do our best in ensuring that this is not only a successful project but one that is a joy for our backers to participate in. We have developed a reputation as an honest, forthright, and caring company that is active in our community, and we plan to continue building upon that rapport, keeping our backers involved in every step of the process.Will problems arise during this process? Of course. But we intend to grow, learn, adapt, and, in the end, deliver a board game that will be a truly compelling experience. Thank you for considering joining this crazy ride with us.As per the terms stated on IGG, a full refund will be provided if the request is received within 7 days of the close of the campaign. Otherwise, such a refund will be at our exclusive discretion and will be net of handling costs, IGG commissions and credit card processing fees (15%).If you fail to check out and pay for your order, including shipping costs, before the posted payment deadline, you may be forfeiting your products. Unclaimed games will be released after the closing date to online and retail sales since we lose money on unclaimed games due to storage fees. Refunds and/or cancellation requests will only be considered before we set the print run size for mass manufacturing with our factory in China, which takes place upon the posted payment deadline for the Pledge Manager.",34.0,4,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary:</h3>
<p>My name is Steven Daniels and I am an inventor aged 54 of just about anything. No rhyme nor reason can I see to not doing anything you set your heart and mind too.</p>
<p>With a background in building, printing, stone masonry, design, the rubber industry even, to name a few it gives you a head full of knowledge.</p>
<p>As inventor of Trominoes I have played it with many people and it hasn't failed yet to amaze me how many ways it can be played.</p>
<p>I have also taken it to Games groups and the feedback is phenomenally positive. True gamer's loving the ways in which it can be played and the tactical ways to stop others scoring and build towards a higher score for themselves.</p>
<p>Its a joy to play for young or old, the first person I played it with was my mum, aged 78, she picked it up in no time at all, it took all of 5 minutes to be building a good score and beat me fair and square by the end.</p>
<p>By ways, I mean the angles, the moves, the shapes, the defensive plays, the offensive plays each and every game will be different to the last. Yet children can play and just match numbers to make shapes or simpy make shapes!</p>

</div><div>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>The machinery we will be purchasing are British made Laser cutters to enable us to expand our range of materials to include many solid and sustainably sourced timbers as well as a few other ideas we have for the future.   </li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>The amount of funding gives us enough to buy 2 machines which we will require to fulfill our mid term requirements as well as space to put them and run a business from.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>If we don't get as much as we feel we need then we will still move ahead with a single machine and run it from a much smaller space to start with. Moving machines and signing contracts is both expensive and time consuming so we would really like to be straight in where we want at the start. If we aren't, it certainly wont stop us, that's for sure.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>We can produce these games with existing machinery and will, but we know we need to make them quicker and in multiples. It’s going to be a big seller. </li></ul>

<p>This pitch gives us both, you and I, something for our money, something for our time and something for the family.</p>
<p>The true enjoyment of your purchase will be two fold in that you helped us to produce it and you added value to your own game because of that fact. </p>
<p>You will be true pioneers, the first to buy and own a set of Trominoes, the first to show your friends how great it is, and they will remember you for it every time they play their game or play yours with you. Perhaps you gave it as a gift to them of course?</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges:</h3>
<p>I have always looked at problems with a view that every one can be dealt with, overcome, got over, under or around.  </p>
<p>The problem we have here is solely a lack of funding to purchase the necessary machinery and upscale our manufacturing enough. Your early purchase allows us to make it cost effective to produce in our own country from materials we like the look and feel of. Giving us complete control over our products.</p>
<p>The sets will also be environmentally friendly with no Formaldehyde's used in the production of the ply and only coming from sustainable sources. The bag is cotton. We see no need for a box with inserts and extras coming at a cost to you and I, let alone the Earth.</p>
<p>We and I say we, including you all, shall produce a game that will be around in another 800 yrs just like the original Dominoes has been.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help:</h3>
<p>Those that cant help us with a purchase, can you please share our pitch and talk about it on social media and everywhere they go if they really love the game and would in time like to see our other games.</p>
<p>Or if you would simply like to help us on our way, then a donation can be made to back us as far as you'd like.</p>
<p>For the first 50th and then every 150 shares we will try and find away to give a gift of a Full 77 Tile set to that 150th, 300th, 450th, 600th and on, Technical but it must be able to be done, everything is.</p>
<p>Please use the Indiegogo sharing tools as well as word of mouth. Anyway you can think of  to get the word out.</p>
<p>I thank you for reading and watching and hopefully you purchased Trominoes, a game that will stand the test of time with infinite ways to play and always giving you multiple satisfaction.</p>

Or if you would simply like to help us on our way, then a donation can be made to back us as far as you'd like.
For the first 50th and then every 150 shares we will try and find away to give a gift of a Full 77 Tile set to that 150th, 300th, 450th, 600th and on, Technical but it must be able to be done, everything is.
Please use the Indiegogo sharing tools as well as word of mouth. Anyway you can think of  to get the word out.
I thank you for reading and watching and hopefully you purchased Trominoes, a game that will stand the test of time with infinite ways to play and always giving you multiple satisfaction.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short but Awesome Summary</h3>
<p>This awesome game of Bung Hole was created by a couple of Floridians who had too much time on their hands and a head full of poop jokes. Obviously, living in the sunshine state, going to the beach is an everyday thing (must be nice). All you gotta do is put the Bowls into the sand and throw our nifty and sturdy Bungs in the hole! It's like cornhole, but better, and for the beach. I mean, could you imagine carrying your cornhole set to the beach? What a weird thing to do! </p>

<li>If we reach the goal, the funds will help us continue manufacturing and creating color variations, bigger sizes, and help feed our staff elephant that is just sitting in the middle of our office. C'MON, DON'T LEAVE THE ELEPHANT HUNGRY!</li>

<h3>The Impact of Bung Hole</h3>
<p>This is a novelty game for the WHOLE FAMILY. Yes, it's laced with poop jokes and humor, but it's family friendly. We are bringing families closer together with poop jokes. What could be better? </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>

      Besides the above-listed monumental foundations on which EXITUS is built, it also has the following 10 important characteristics:  Covid-19 has made the last year terribly hard for everybody, so we’ve decided that our base package should cost just 17 EUR and within this price, we offer not the usual 1 hour “Escape the Room” game or a simple book experience, but about 10 hours of mysteries, challenges, storytelling, and fun.And to all our future backers who are willing to choose a higher pledge level – THANK YOU!Each of you will not only get additional special extras but will also support us and our immense effort.  Our goal is to make participation in the project as easy as possible, so the payment will be one-time and will take place here, on Indiegogo Platform. This includes also the shipping costs when ordering the „ARTE FACTA” level. IMPORTANT: When you pledge for the ""Arte Facta"" level, the delivery price will be automatically added at the time of the pre-order. If you get a message that your country is not eligible for delivery, write us a personal message and we will check if we will be able to add your country of residence to the list.  * (Lat.) an object that is made by a person, such as a tool or a decoration, especially one that is of historical interest.A set of FOUR mysterious, beautiful, and purely hand-made artefacts, included in the ARTE FACTA Reward Level.  This is the accessory that served as an inspiration for the magic bracelets worn by the main characters in the saga.It’s a bracelet with a unique design, hand-woven using a specific technique, and 414 precise needlepoint stitches. It features the Elbetitsa figure in which are coded several ancient symbols of health, wealth, and harmony.Elbetitsa is one of the oldest images found in the solar calendars of many peoples and exists as a symbol in almost all of the main ancient religions in the world.Apart from being an elegant accessory, the bracelet is A CLUE and unlocks an additional and self-contained chapter in the game where you can find yet one more unique puzzle.The bracelet is unisex and comfortable to wear on the left or the right hand.   Both medallions bear the original design that inspired the images on the amulets that protect Marc and Zoé during their adventure. They feature two ancient runic symbols dated back to the 1st century CE and found in many different written records across the world.The material they are made of is pieces of wild cherry wood remaining after the making of furniture and usually thrown away as waste.Our master craftsman buys these beautiful pieces of waste wood directly from the furniture factory and turns them into hand-made works of art.Both accessories are unisex, extremely comfortable to wear, with soft fabric necklaces.Each of the medallions is A CLUE to an additional and self-contained chapter in the game where you can find yet one more riddle.   A top-secret object that will remain hidden until you receive it. What we can say now, however, is that it's created by us personally and for you to be able to solve its secret, it will require some extra courage because it could be even a little dangerous.This item is accompanied by an additional and hidden story chapter, plus the clever hints if you need some help while solving the puzzle.  The challenges in EXITUS have been designed in such a way that they can be solved by one person or group of people.*If you prefer to read the story at your leisure and solve the puzzles by yourself – you do that.*If you want to share your enjoyment of the game with those close to you – your friends or family, you can do that as well.   EXITUS is a game that illustrates the way an epic novel transforms into an unforgettable interactive experience when it is integrated with unique riddles, mysterious physical artefacts, music, sounds, portraits, graphics, and more.  EXITUS is a lengthy pleasure which, depending on the speed of reading and of solving riddles, can even last for few days. That’s why every time you close the EXITUS App, your last position will be saved automatically and when you next open the game, you’ll continue from the point where you last left off.  Once you’ve downloaded EXITUS App on your phone or tablet, you can go on to read the story and enjoy the music, sound effects, portraits, graphics, hints, the answers to the riddles – and in general, play the whole game from the beginning to the end.Without internet. Everywhere. No limitations.  You’ve been solving the riddles quite well; you are ahead with the story and are becoming more and more involved in its complications when suddenly … your progress is blocked by a puzzle for which you need a hint.And while you’re frantically searching the internet for a helpful clue or waiting for another player to advise you on your next action, your initial excitement melts away and never comes back the way it was.With EXITUS the above scenario is impossible.If you need a hint, it’s at your disposal at any moment because all hints, together with all the answers, can be found in EXITUS App and are always just one click away.This allows you to choose your own tempo at which to move ahead in the game, as well as to make your own decision when or whether to use a hint.   EXITUS doesn’t come out of nothing.EXITUS is part of the world’s first multilingual Challenge Book Game Series and although it has been created as a fully self-contained and independent game to be played with no prior preparation, the first two parts of the series come as a free bonus accompanying it.

We specialize in Media and game entertainment production. Each member of our core production and development team, has a deep background in media production, marketing, game development, law, and computer securities. Because of this rather diverse team of professionals, it grants us the unique ability to create new concepts in media entertainment, and game design, while also understanding how to shore up our cost potentials and limit the production overhead a great deal more than most of our Independent competitors.<br/><br/>The core scope of this campaign was originally to generate enough market interest in the form of pre-sale revenue, from you the viewer. This way we can facilitate the mass market production of our popular Social intrigue and corporate scandal game; “Monkey Wrench deluxe edition”. However, what we discovered that as we got closer to releasing this innovative social game, that we kept finding more and more things to add to it, that just simply made sense. Thus kept changing and tweaking everything until we refined the original game into something so much more profound, and much more captivating, that we had to sell this game as something better.<br/><br/>I present unto you; ""Monkey Wrench"" - Second edition. Now, our plan is to still mass produce this title at a much higher volume, than before. But this time we decided to go through a different manufacturer, than before. Currently, our first edition copy was initially released back in April of 2017, through the Print on Demand website, ""The Game Crafter"" (Link Below). While is a great site for new innovative printing concepts in gaming and entertainment. Simply cannot handle the larger sales volumes that we have seen in many of our competitors. To be competitive, we need to be able to work with a company that can handle any volume, that you, our customers desire. Which is something, our current manufacturer, simply can not sustain.<br/><br/>Thus, while this game has been viewed as being a great concept in social gaming, that has received nothing short of a highly welcomed, change in the normal standards for “Social interaction” games. Our current source for mass production, simply cannot compete with many of our larger competitors and puts us, a new innovative game, at a serious disadvantage against any of our competitors. Especially since we are a first ever game, that additionally also has the ability to be played both in a casual setting and within something more professional. Being the first ever game of its kind puts us in a delicate position; in that this game can be played within any environment, and needs to be able to handle higher volumes of production, sustained by many of our current competitors. Especially and intentionally, since this game can also be marketed, and played within the standard workplace setting, such as being used as a “Team building”, “Icebreaking”, or “Social Experimentation” exercise, as well as just a game of casual role play.<br/><br/>In fact, we intentionally designed and developed this simple social interaction game to be used for exactly this purpose. To be used at your next Team building exercise. Now instead of closing your eyes and falling into the hands of others, and ""Trusting"" them to catch you when you fall, you now can sit in a circle, and socially pretend to be different roles within your very company or job. Building lasting role dynamic relationships, where you and your co-workers must work together as a team in a simulated setting.<br/><br/>Which means that this game, because of the way it's designed, allows players to enact different workplace “themed” social roles. ""Pretending"" to be different title roles within a fictitious company. Empowering each person with simple abilities, and duties akin to what a person in those positions of power would hold. We then shake things up a bit, a create multiple challenges, for the group to handle. Producing different ""Secret"" teams, that operate outside the simulated company, with their own agenda's, roles, and ideas. teaching players to work together in strict confidence while attempting to individually deduce, which fellow players are the positive roles in the workplace environment, and which fellow players are the damaging “Social scandals” of the workplace environment. Which many of us have often encountered.<br/><br/>By playing a simple social game in which our individual “Employment titles” and “Job roles” are replaced with situational “Professional titles” and “Occupational roles”, it allows each person playing the game to embrace and enact the sensation of being different people within an office setting. It also gives them the mindset, lifestyle, and their own individual responsibilities within the corporate environment. Providing a much richer overall professional experience for each individual, that garners them a broader perspective of the lifestyles and role dynamics that each of their fellow employee's experiences within their own workplace dynamic.<br/><br/>However, despite this innovative concept in social gaming, our games current retail price is through our current manufacturer, is simply just too high to be competitive. Standing at a staggering online, per unit POD price of $54.99 USD; our profit margin as the developers of this product is only a mere $3.50. The base production price alone outside of any potential sales or resales of this product is double the retail sales price of our competitors. Meaning that to sell this game at a retail store using the laws of doubles, means I'd have to sell this game for an upwards of $120! Imagine that.. walking into your favorite game store and seeing a card game on the shelf selling for $120, sitting next to ""Cards against humanity"", that's selling for $30. Which product are you likely to buy? Even the extremely rare, and highly sought after original late 80's CCG game ""Xenophile"", is only 90$ a copy. That game had a print run of only 10k units. It's staggering.  Simply put; the Print on demand market, while convenient, has a staggering individual unit production overhead that's also keeping our popular product off of the public retail shelves. Meaning simply, our game cannot be seen by persons like yourself, who find these types of games fun and innovating.<br/><br/>What we need from you today, is your generous contribution towards our $30,000 target production goal. That initial revenue will be immediately sent to our now established manufacturing partner, “Panda” publishing (Link below). Who are also the same professional manufacturer and Developer of such popular hits as “Dead of Winter”, “Scythe” “pandemic”, and yes even our market competitor, “Ultimate Werewolf”. Our target seed goal will cover the $14,870, initial printing and production expense of producing an initial production run of 2500 units. The remaining balance of that $30,000, will be directed towards covering the shipping and handling cost of the final product. Which will be distributed from the manufacturers holding warehouse, based in Sunny, Los Angeles California, to each of our distribution warehouses, located in here Indiana, and Arizona. Which means that the remaining balance of that $30,000$ goal (Roughly $4,000), will help us facilitate the warehousing cost's of all the final units until we can get them delivered to persons such as yourself and our other retail small business that we are in the process of establishing shipping relations with.<br/><br/>This will further help us as a company no longer be limited to only being able to sell to you, our highly entertaining product online, at an exaggerated price. It will further grant us the ability the change the staggering online only price of $54.99 per unit to a far more reasonable retail price of $29.99. Additionally, we will be able to re-distribute this fantastic title into all of your favorite retail game store locations, establishing this highly entertaining social game, openly available across the country, and even semi- internationally. Imagine your next social gathering, where you and all your friends and colleagues try to figure out which person in the room is the elusive “Monkey Wrench”, the team of corporate saboteurs, who are trying to win the game through social manipulation and socio-political influence. We think you too will be highly entertained by this game as much as we were creating it, testing it, and making it available to you, today. Please help us make this game just as popular as “Werewolf” and “Card against Humanity”.<br/><br/>Thank You;<br/><br/>Seth T.

Niccum. I am the C.E.O. of Tokumei LLC. Based here in Indianapolis Indiana. We specialize in Media and game entertainment production. Each member of our core production and development team, has a deep background in media production, marketing, game development, law, and computer securities. Because of this rather diverse team of professionals, it grants us the unique ability to create new concepts in media entertainment, and game design, while also understanding how to shore up our cost potentials and limit the production overhead a great deal more than most of our Independent competitors.The core scope of this campaign was originally to generate enough market interest in the form of pre-sale revenue, from you the viewer. This way we can facilitate the mass market production of our popular Social intrigue and corporate scandal game; “Monkey Wrench deluxe edition”. However, what we discovered that as we got closer to releasing this innovative social game, that we kept finding more and more things to add to it, that just simply made sense. Thus kept changing and tweaking everything until we refined the original game into something so much more profound, and much more captivating, that we had to sell this game as something better.I present unto you; ""Monkey Wrench"" - Second edition. Now, our plan is to still mass produce this title at a much higher volume, than before. But this time we decided to go through a different manufacturer, than before. Currently, our first edition copy was initially released back in April of 2017, through the Print on Demand website, ""The Game Crafter"" (Link Below). While is a great site for new innovative printing concepts in gaming and entertainment. Simply cannot handle the larger sales volumes that we have seen in many of our competitors. To be competitive, we need to be able to work with a company that can handle any volume, that you, our customers desire. Which is something, our current manufacturer, simply can not sustain.Thus, while this game has been viewed as being a great concept in social gaming, that has received nothing short of a highly welcomed, change in the normal standards for “Social interaction” games. Our current source for mass production, simply cannot compete with many of our larger competitors and puts us, a new innovative game, at a serious disadvantage against any of our competitors. Especially since we are a first ever game, that additionally also has the ability to be played both in a casual setting and within something more professional. Being the first ever game of its kind puts us in a delicate position; in that this game can be played within any environment, and needs to be able to handle higher volumes of production, sustained by many of our current competitors. Especially and intentionally, since this game can also be marketed, and played within the standard workplace setting, such as being used as a “Team building”, “Icebreaking”, or “Social Experimentation” exercise, as well as just a game of casual role play.In fact, we intentionally designed and developed this simple social interaction game to be used for exactly this purpose. To be used at your next Team building exercise. Now instead of closing your eyes and falling into the hands of others, and ""Trusting"" them to catch you when you fall, you now can sit in a circle, and socially pretend to be different roles within your very company or job. Building lasting role dynamic relationships, where you and your co-workers must work together as a team in a simulated setting.Which means that this game, because of the way it's designed, allows players to enact different workplace “themed” social roles. ""Pretending"" to be different title roles within a fictitious company. Empowering each person with simple abilities, and duties akin to what a person in those positions of power would hold. We then shake things up a bit, a create multiple challenges, for the group to handle. Producing different ""Secret"" teams, that operate outside the simulated company, with their own agenda's, roles, and ideas. teaching players to work together in strict confidence while attempting to individually deduce, which fellow players are the positive roles in the workplace environment, and which fellow players are the damaging “Social scandals” of the workplace environment. Which many of us have often encountered.By playing a simple social game in which our individual “Employment titles” and “Job roles” are replaced with situational “Professional titles” and “Occupational roles”, it allows each person playing the game to embrace and enact the sensation of being different people within an office setting. It also gives them the mindset, lifestyle, and their own individual responsibilities within the corporate environment. Providing a much richer overall professional experience for each individual, that garners them a broader perspective of the lifestyles and role dynamics that each of their fellow employee's experiences within their own workplace dynamic.However, despite this innovative concept in social gaming, our games current retail price is through our current manufacturer, is simply just too high to be competitive. Standing at a staggering online, per unit POD price of $54.99 USD; our profit margin as the developers of this product is only a mere $3.50. The base production price alone outside of any potential sales or resales of this product is double the retail sales price of our competitors. Meaning that to sell this game at a retail store using the laws of doubles, means I'd have to sell this game for an upwards of $120! Imagine that.. walking into your favorite game store and seeing a card game on the shelf selling for $120, sitting next to ""Cards against humanity"", that's selling for $30. Which product are you likely to buy? Even the extremely rare, and highly sought after original late 80's CCG game ""Xenophile"", is only 90$ a copy. That game had a print run of only 10k units. It's staggering.  Simply put; the Print on demand market, while convenient, has a staggering individual unit production overhead that's also keeping our popular product off of the public retail shelves. Meaning simply, our game cannot be seen by persons like yourself, who find these types of games fun and innovating.What we need from you today, is your generous contribution towards our $30,000 target production goal. That initial revenue will be immediately sent to our now established manufacturing partner, “Panda” publishing (Link below). Who are also the same professional manufacturer and Developer of such popular hits as “Dead of Winter”, “Scythe” “pandemic”, and yes even our market competitor, “Ultimate Werewolf”. Our target seed goal will cover the $14,870, initial printing and production expense of producing an initial production run of 2500 units. The remaining balance of that $30,000, will be directed towards covering the shipping and handling cost of the final product. Which will be distributed from the manufacturers holding warehouse, based in Sunny, Los Angeles California, to each of our distribution warehouses, located in here Indiana, and Arizona. Which means that the remaining balance of that $30,000$ goal (Roughly $4,000), will help us facilitate the warehousing cost's of all the final units until we can get them delivered to persons such as yourself and our other retail small business that we are in the process of establishing shipping relations with.This will further help us as a company no longer be limited to only being able to sell to you, our highly entertaining product online, at an exaggerated price. It will further grant us the ability the change the staggering online only price of $54.99 per unit to a far more reasonable retail price of $29.99. Additionally, we will be able to re-distribute this fantastic title into all of your favorite retail game store locations, establishing this highly entertaining social game, openly available across the country, and even semi- internationally. Imagine your next social gathering, where you and all your friends and colleagues try to figure out which person in the room is the elusive “Monkey Wrench”, the team of corporate saboteurs, who are trying to win the game through social manipulation and socio-political influence. We think you too will be highly entertained by this game as much as we were creating it, testing it, and making it available to you, today. Please help us make this game just as popular as “Werewolf” and “Card against Humanity”.Thank You;Seth T. NiccumCEO – Tokumei LLC. Unable to fund this project? here are other ways You Can Help:

Tired of push-fitting and breaking down building blocks so much that your fingertip turns red.  
You have a 3D printer and want to print something that your kids can toy with. 
Just need to have a small toy on your desk to mess with to kill boredom.
Or
Want to print a set of wargaming terrain that you can break down and change.
 
If so, then good news! I’m sure you’ll like the kits I designed.​ Right now you might be wondering:“How do you make all the parts connect and break down so easily?”  Basically the kit uses magnets to create enough binding force to connect the parts.  And a very simple structure built inside the parts prevents the magnet repelling each other.  Printable content 
Basic kit  Pipe support kit Expansion kit(Each kit is delivered as an STL digital file pack to print on your home 3d printer.)  Back my project and receive files to print these pipes on your own. if you have any questions about C Pipe, you can ask here. Assembling the kitYou might also be wondering if the kit will be difficult to assemble.So let’s take a look at the simple assembling method.  All the parts can be put together by latch mechanism.
The size of the neodymium magnets are D8*2mm . (Due to the different levels of precision of each printer, we have put in five files for caps of different tightness, so you can choose the best one for you. If you still feel the cap is too loose for your liking, you can also use glue to seal the cap.)
 
 
Specifications
After assambleing, all of the pieces are no bigger than a 36*36*36mm cube.
(some special parts may have a different length compared to other parts.)

 
Let’s see how these pipes can be put together!Here are some examples:Break down quickly The following pictures contains parts you can get from the Expansion kit:

</div></div>","You love your games. So why would you trust a cheap plastic bag to transport your games around?At GeekOn! we believe that your board games deserve the absolute best. The good news? We have the best way to carry your games. The bad news? You currently don’t… for now.  
                                                                         In our quest to design the best boardgame bag we focused on 3 main points. Protection, Organization & Comfort.    
 
 
  
 
 
 
                                                                                    Expandable game section allowing you to keep the bag compact to carry a few games but able to transform into a huge game cave for those times it’s your turn to bring all the games.Which let’s face it, is everytime.
 
  Sure we could've made the bag with inexpensive materials but that would leave your bags open to fray and tear and to also get that odd ""fuzzed out"" issue which honestly make your bag look terrible. Trust me I have a super comfy pair of pants that got all fuzzy and I can only wear it around the house for fear of ridicule. We don't want you to only wear these bags around the house so we opted for the best quality materials!Inexpensive materials would also leave your games open to getting ruined from the elements. That's why we went with a water-resistant 500D rip-stop nylon that provides significant tear and abrasion resistance with the interwoven materials helping to keep any rips from spreading and leaving your games at risk!  
  One surprise rainy day could catch you off guard and your tote bag just won’t cut it. Without these waterproof zippers you risk ruining your board games which means you coming into game night empty handed. You had the best games of the night and now the only game left to play is Battleship and everyone hates you. We don't want everyone to hate you so we opted for the extra large waterproof zippers. You're welcome. 
 
 The shoulder straps on our bags are made out of moisture wicking mesh. What does that mean? It means that our mesh wicks moisture. No one likes sitting next to someone who’s been soaked through their shirt. Extra padding on the shoulder straps will make it seem as though you’re carrying nothing at all. But don’t forget you’re actually carrying your backpack because that could get ugly real quick. DISCLAIMER - GeekOn! Accepts no liability in the event you forget you’re wearing the backpack and get caught between subway doors on the way to or from game night.
 
 Adjustable shoulder straps allows you to adjust the bag to its most comfortable position whether you’re a low-carrier to show off that new neck tattoo or prefer to keep your backpack up high to relieve pressure on your back. 
 
  A Sternum Strap allows the bag to stay secure to your body to help distribute the bag weight, and as a plus, chicks dig Sternum Straps. 
 
  The back part of the backpack uses the same awesome moisture wicking mesh (you know, the mesh that wicks moisture we were talking about before?) with extra padding to keep your back feeling like you’re carrying a cloud. A cloud full of board games. 
 
  Speaking about padding… we made sure to add padding to the grab handle too. Now the handle won’t dig into your hand and make you cry… something I definitely don’t do... 
 
 Just plain generic zipper pulls wouldn't do so we've got custom rubber zipper pulls on each bag to match the inside color of the bags! 
  
  Your laptop can join the fun too with its own dedicated padded pocket that fits 15"" laptops! Maybe when AI becomes more advanced it can play too.  
 
  You know when you walk around asking everyone where your sunglasses are only to find out that they're resting on your head? Well we've sewn a strip on each side of the shoulder straps for you to clip your sunglasses to so the next time you walk around asking if anyone's seen your sunglasses your friends won't have to point quite as high up. 
 
 Pen Slot included, how else are you going to markdown how many times you’ve made your friends cry? 
  
  Keep track of how many times you’ve smoked your friends in Catan with a dedicated section for your notepads and extra game manuals. 
 
 Getting to game night sure can make a gamer thirsty. That’s why there’s an easily accessible side water bottle pocket. Still thirsty? There’s also a second bottle pocket on the other side of the bag for more water or to hold your celebratory beer for after you dominate the night!
 
 We made is easy to carry all your essentials with various sized zipper and elastic pockets under the main bag flap. These pockets are perfect for your tech accessories, extra pens, markers, card games, snacks etc. Feel free to share your snacks with everyone but we recommend keeping your chapstick to yourself. 
 
  There is an over-sized zippered pocket on each side of the bag above the koozie pockets. These pockets are perfect for those smaller card games like Sushi Go, Uno, Dos or in a few years when they release Tres. 
 
 Store your sunglasses and tech in their dedicated pocket at the top of the backpack. The pocket is protected so the sunglasses that you “borrowed” from your friend Mark won’t break.  
 Keep your keys, keycards, transit cards, etc easily within reach in the conveniently placed shoulder strap pocket. I personally keep a whistle on mine and blow it whenever someone over-rolls the dice and messes up the board! ( I don’t have many friends left…) 
 
 Keep your dice tray and dice case under a dedicated elastic strap in the top section.  
 
 We've got three velcro pockets in the top section of the bag which are perfect for securing cards or larger card games in their boxes.    DESIGN AND PROTOTYPING
We went through months of designing, testing, re-designing and re-testing until we came up with a bag that we felt confident would hold up to everything we thought a solid boardgame bag should be!

<p>Our Story </p>
<p>Power Struggle came to be because we played the card game Presidents and Assholes for years. We discovered that everyone played the game differently which resulted in arguments about the rules. Also, the “President"" is supposed to generate a new rule each game, and the same boring rules would be created over and over. People just didn’t enjoy coming up with new rules on the spot.</p>

 Game is Quick - 5-10 minutes to play a round
 Play with 2-10 People - Play with a wide array of people
 Hilarious New Rules - Each round a new rule card is drawn. These rules are hilarious and keep the game new and fresh. 

Our Story 
Power Struggle came to be because we played the card game Presidents and Assholes for years. We discovered that everyone played the game differently which resulted in arguments about the rules. Also, the “President"" is supposed to generate a new rule each game, and the same boring rules would be created over and over. People just didn’t enjoy coming up with new rules on the spot.
We said to ourselves, “This game is really fun but it has some problems. If we fixed those problems we would have a really, really fun game."" So, we went to work. It took a couple  of months, but we took this game and turned it into something amazingly fun. We hope you enjoy it and create memories with friends and family that last for years. 

Strategy
Power Struggle is a card game that can be played while drinking or not drinking. It is highly strategic and extremely rewarding to win. The deck is made up of number cards and wild cards that need to be played at the correct time to help you win.

<li>This game is expensive to produce, unfortunately. So for 200 copies of this game, we require roughly 6000 dollars to make each of the parts of the game. They are the box, the fold-able board game mat, moon tokens, figures and dice. </li>

<li>Finally, if someone contributes 1000$ or more, they will get the complete board game, 2 signed prints of my work, an original artwork of mine and I will make a custom artwork for them, like a portrait or something else they want.</li>
<li>Those who donate 30$ or more will receive the game if the goal is reached.</li>
<li>The funds will go towards making as much board games as possible. If the goal is not reached, less than 200 games will be made. </li>

<p>Ever since I started <i>The Folio</i> I've wanted to take a different look at gaming and go back to the heady days of the late 70s and early 80s and robust swords &amp; sorcery storytelling.  When I was a kid life was different, tropes were different and seemingly more acceptable, and I wanted to create a Folio line that brought some of that era back into the light.</p>
<p><i><strong>The Folio: Black Label </strong></i>is going to have a more adult edge than is found in the standard <i>Folio</i>, and yes, there might be some nudity, and maybe some horror, and maybe a twisted quality here or there, but at the base its really just about the unfettered fun of hacking and slashing your way through a pulp style adventure with blatant evil doers, magical treasures, and exposed flesh.  </p>
<p>So, I'm throwing out the playbook for 2019, and turning the flux capacitor back to the early days of gaming.  I hope some of you will join me. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559326798/gjvnsgjs2b9asvogqcji.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Why Only 150?</strong> Well, because <i>The Folio: Black Label </i>isn't for everyone, and as such I didn't want to create something mass market, but instead make a collectors item that a person can use to gloat over their friends with, just like you did when you were a kid and got the latest <i>D&amp;D </i>supplement :)  So, I'm going to make 150 of these and let the chips fall where they may.  Also, I'm going to do stretch goals in the number of folks in the campaign, and not the dollar total since that will be capped for the most part.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559326845/rcyy5yvdtng0pctqgcgr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Great Cover, who did it? </strong> Well, it is an incredible painting by former TSR artist Daniel Horne!  If you want to check out more of his incredible work, and help him continue to paint awesome fantasy, why not check out his <i><strong>GoFundMe</strong></i> that is currently running!  You can find it here: <a href=""https://www.gofundme.com/keep-classic-painted-fantasy-art-alive"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.gofundme.com/keep-classic-painted-f...</a></p>
<p>AND, you can also find Daniel's work on an interior centerfold of one of the primary antagonists! So here is a sneak peak!</p>

</div></div>","Ever since I started The Folio I've wanted to take a different look at gaming and go back to the heady days of the late 70s and early 80s and robust swords & sorcery storytelling.  When I was a kid life was different, tropes were different and seemingly more acceptable, and I wanted to create a Folio line that brought some of that era back into the light.
The Folio: Black Label is going to have a more adult edge than is found in the standard Folio, and yes, there might be some nudity, and maybe some horror, and maybe a twisted quality here or there, but at the base its really just about the unfettered fun of hacking and slashing your way through a pulp style adventure with blatant evil doers, magical treasures, and exposed flesh.  
So, I'm throwing out the playbook for 2019, and turning the flux capacitor back to the early days of gaming.  I hope some of you will join me. 

Why Only 150? Well, because The Folio: Black Label isn't for everyone, and as such I didn't want to create something mass market, but instead make a collectors item that a person can use to gloat over their friends with, just like you did when you were a kid and got the latest D&D supplement :)  So, I'm going to make 150 of these and let the chips fall where they may.  Also, I'm going to do stretch goals in the number of folks in the campaign, and not the dollar total since that will be capped for the most part.

Great Cover, who did it?  Well, it is an incredible painting by former TSR artist Daniel Horne!  If you want to check out more of his incredible work, and help him continue to paint awesome fantasy, why not check out his GoFundMe that is currently running!  You can find it here: https://www.gofundme.com/keep-classic-painted-f...
AND, you can also find Daniel's work on an interior centerfold of one of the primary antagonists! So here is a sneak peak!

Who is this adventure for?: It will be based around  classic AD&D gaming mechanics, while also have 'grey' stat and  treasure blocks for 5th Edition D&D,  so it is easily playable in  BOTH formats.  It has been designed for  6-8 characters, roughly 3rd  through 5th, and will include a Virtual  Table Top map without secret doors, traps, and numbers.  
What does the adventure for The Sins of the Three Sisters revolve around? Well, this will be a standard swords & sorcery based adventure that is based around a corrupted swamp with three old temples that are plaguing the lands with undead, monsters, and dark magic.  The initial adventure will include  a 3 temple for exploration adventure featuring all of the 'three sisters'.  
Can we see some of the 3D Folio Maps? Absolutely, and this one could possibly have 3 such maps, as well as the standard 'blue' maps common to early modules.

<h3>The best thing that has happened to Chess!</h3>
<p>Hello Chess lovers,</p>
<p>Ever since I started playing Chess in my kindergarten, there were number of occasions when somebody and I were playing Chess and my brother or a friend was just watching the game. Even though he or she eagerly wanted to play. Sometimes it was me watching the game, eagerly wanting to play. (Has this ever happened to you?) I have always wondered since then if three people can play Chess at the same time. It was this desire that led me to Triwizard Chess, Chess for three players.</p>
<p>This game is simply Chess for three players with none of the original rules altered and exact same pieces for each player. (Otherwise it won't be Chess, right!) We hope to redefine the world of Chess.</p>
<p>This game is of Chess lovers, by Chess lovers and for Chess lovers!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530450459/i4apkcnkzktksxpaps4o.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Things to note:</strong></p>
<p>1. Triwizard Chess board size is 24 inch x 24 inch and its base is Sunboard. (And the pieces are solid plastic.)</p>
<p>2. Colored blocks (sectors) at the center serve as visual aids for making vertical moves. No sectors are to be occupied.</p>
<p>3. Move diagonally forward or backward along the Trajectory lines when required. Trajectory lines are thin lines designed as visual aids for making diagonal moves present in 5th and 6th row. You will get diagrams in the instruction sheet.</p>

Hello Chess lovers,
Ever since I started playing Chess in my kindergarten, there were number of occasions when somebody and I were playing Chess and my brother or a friend was just watching the game. Even though he or she eagerly wanted to play. Sometimes it was me watching the game, eagerly wanting to play. (Has this ever happened to you?) I have always wondered since then if three people can play Chess at the same time. It was this desire that led me to Triwizard Chess, Chess for three players.
This game is simply Chess for three players with none of the original rules altered and exact same pieces for each player. (Otherwise it won't be Chess, right!) We hope to redefine the world of Chess.
This game is of Chess lovers, by Chess lovers and for Chess lovers!

Things to note:
1. Triwizard Chess board size is 24 inch x 24 inch and its base is Sunboard. (And the pieces are solid plastic.)
2. Colored blocks (sectors) at the center serve as visual aids for making vertical moves. No sectors are to be occupied.
3. Move diagonally forward or backward along the Trajectory lines when required. Trajectory lines are thin lines designed as visual aids for making diagonal moves present in 5th and 6th row. You will get diagrams in the instruction sheet.
Help us bring this game to you, your family and friends, fund us today!

The game gets more intense than regular Chess. Don’t take our word for it - try it.

<h3>SoundTrak!™ The Music Game</h3>
<p>We've all done it. Sitting with friends and family and sharing memories of songs and music and how it defines some of life's events. We talk about the music we like and enjoy and music and songs we don't like. There's the one hit wonders, songs we danced to and still dance to, our wedding songs, times with our kids, a song that brings on a vacation memory. And then there's the music or that one song that completely rocked your world! Rock, Jazz, Rap, Country, Bluegrass, Broadway, Classical, Gospel, it's all in SoundTrak!™ The Music Game. It's Your life, Your music.</p>
<p>A card is picked. The challenge and the topic are out. The search is on for the music. You find it, you play it and if your song is chosen as the best song for the topic, you win!</p>

<p>SoundTrak!™ The Music Game was born from a summer evening with friends, playing music loudly, laughing and sharing. This game changes every time you play it.

<h3>The Quest</h3>
<p>Hi! This is Planet Quest: a 3D printed strategy board game where players race to explore the galaxy. Players discover planets, complete quests, and battle each other to be the first to explore the ends of the galaxy.</p>
<p>We are Katie, Connor, Natasha, and Jethro: 4 students currently in the USC Games program. We're deeply passionate about making games of all shapes and sizes. But more than that, we love to make games that can touch people and bring a little bit of joy into their lives.</p>
<p>So we made Planet Quest to create an approachable, yet deep gameplay experience for those new to the strategy game genre.</p>

<h3>What Comes In The ""Box""?</h3>

<strong>4 Player Ships </strong>The player pieces that you'll use to zoom around the Aurora Galaxy.</li>
<li>
<strong>4 Resources Trackers</strong> Featuring dials (that spin) to track your Quest Points, Gems, and Space Pennies, as well as slots to store your crew and ship upgrade cards.</li>
<li>
<strong>3 Shop Card Decks </strong>One deck for each ring containing special ship upgrades to help you in your race to explore the galaxy. </li>
<li>
<strong>3 Planetary Rings </strong>3 fully assemblable rings that together make up the Aurora Galaxy. Each ring has 5 planetary slots inhabited by unique alien civilizations. </li>
<li>
<strong>3 Planet Containers</strong> The storage containers that hold the planet pieces until they are discovered and placed on the board. </li>
<li>
<strong>15 Planet Pieces </strong>5 Red, Blue, Yellow, Purple, and Green planets pieces.</li>
<li><strong>15 Planet Markers </strong></li>
<li>
<strong>28 Dice </strong>Dice are used to represent your crew and they help you explore. </li>
<li><strong>Our Sincere Appreciation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Where Does The Money Go?</strong></p>
<p>Simply put we need support to make more of this game.</p>
<ul>
<li>The funding for the purely digital versions will go to supporting the developers, and help them prototype and produce physical copies of the game. If we exceed our goal by enough, we plan on looking into injection molding to mass-produce copies of the game, and potentially create a digital version.</li>
<li>Funds for the physical versions will primarily account for production costs, while also helping the developers similarly to what is stated above. </li>
<li>If the project isn't fully funded, we still plan on getting everyone what they paid for. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The main goal since day one has been to make a strategy game that is approachable for new players while still maintaining the depth and replayability that is typical of strategy games:</p>
<ul><li>We designed the Planet and Shop Card systems to allow for players to interact with the game in creative ways at every skill level.</li></ul>
<p>At the end of the day, we're a bunch of passionate developers who want to be able to give more people the ability to get the same enjoyment out of strategy games that we've had.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest hurdle we have right now is getting access to our 3D printers. In all honesty, we wanted to come to you with a more refined product at this time, but due to COVID-19, we lost a lot of our ability to ideate and test. This is why our gameplay video contains older versions of the game pieces, and our 3D rendered images demonstrate newer designs. We still managed to bring something together that we're super excited about, but we don't have a clear timeline of when we will get access to our 3D printing facilities again. </p>
<ul>
<li>We've been working hard to refine our 2D assets, and come up with creative solutions to continue the development process without our 3D printers. </li>
<li>If need be, we plan on reaching out to fellow 3D printing enthusiasts to help us test prints and get this awesome game out to you all as quickly as possible. </li>

<p>In this mystical world, there are creatures from other dimensions from hundreds of centuries ago.

We, human beings, studied them and tried hard to manipulate them during ancient times. We call the art of dealing with paranormal creatures Onmyo Magic.</p>
<p>The objective of Night Parade of 100 Demons is simple: you have to capture wild Yokai, put them under your control, form battle formations, manage your resources, and destroy other Onmyo mages. Although it may seem simple, you still have to be very strategic and calculated with your approach.</p>

<p>Innovative Gameplay:</p>
<p>This game features original gameplay which uses a common deck, a common pool, and individual hands. Players have to evaluate the resources they have, the Yokai in the current common pool, as well as the battle formations of your opponents.</p>
<p>You have to manage the resources you have to protect yourself from your opponent’s attack. Make sure you spend some of your resources to make significant moves while leaving some for defending your Yokai and position. You use your resources to your advantage: you can choose to go full offensive or full defensive.</p>
<p>Position Matters!</p>
<p>This game requires more skill than luck. Players have to consider where to put their Yokai as well as what kind of Yokai to catch. Stronger Yokai is harder to catch and hence they require more resources, generally, as you have to defeat the Yokai before catching it.<br/>However, you have to cleverly position your Yokai once captured, so that your opponent may not reach them effectively.</p>

<p>After reviewing samples from many manufacturers, I am happy to be working with Shuffled Ink. They are proudly family owned &amp; operated since 1999, and have produced millions of decks of custom playing cards, board games, and tarot cards for individuals and companies around the world. They have production facilities in both Orlando, Florida, and Nantong, China. They are attentive and friendly, and follow up on their promises.  I was seeking an environmentally-friendly ink product, so I asked Charles (my contact and owner of Shuffled Ink) if we could use a soy ink instead of the usual petroleum-based one. Charles went out of his way for a couple of weeks to do the sourcing to make that possible. Their products are certified safe and are high quality. I love how this deck looks and feels.</p>

Born in Guatemala’s Caribbean coast, Nery discovered his passion for art and illustration as a child when his 3rd Grade teacher neglected to teach anything but art for the whole year. Nery believes that interesting things happen when the creative impulse is cultivated with curiosity, freedom and intensity. Trained and worked with legendary designer Saul Bass for five years, Nery has worked in a range of art forms, including painting, mural making, illustration, ceramics, block printing, and photography.

<h3><strong>SHIPPING AND HANDLING</strong></h3>
<p>In order to give you the most competitive pricing on shipping, we will not be charging shipping and taxes through Indiegogo, but will be charging it closer to our delivery dates through BackerKit.  Shipping should be in the ballpark of $9 for U.S. orders and up to $13 for international. Extra decks are a minimal add on cost of about $3ea.  (See more in FAQ.)</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</h3>
<p>The lion's share of production prep is finished, but a large amount still remains in printing and packaging. My monetary goal and timeline are based off of pre-existing quotes with some extra padding in case of changes. I feel prepared. I am not new to manufacturing as I ran a boutique high end candy company for almost 20 years, and I've seen a brush fire or two in my day. I will communicate any such issues if they arise, along the way. This process should be really straight forward. That said, we are in unexplored territory with<strong> Covid-19, which has already created both production and shipping delays</strong>, so we do ask for understanding if necessary.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>All Donations Matter:</h3>
<p>All donations matter. No kidding. I know this is fundraiser talk, but it is absolutely true. All donations matter.  </p>
<p>We would love it if you could share on this page on your social media platforms or screenshot photos of the cards and have conversations about about them.  We are trying to change the world through interesting conversations. Get started early.</p>

Nery Orellana  -  A versatile graphic designer and artist with over 30 years of experience who lives and works in Los Angeles, California. Born in Guatemala’s Caribbean coast, Nery discovered his passion for art and illustration as a child when his 3rd Grade teacher neglected to teach anything but art for the whole year. Nery believes that interesting things happen when the creative impulse is cultivated with curiosity, freedom and intensity. Trained and worked with legendary designer Saul Bass for five years, Nery has worked in a range of art forms, including painting, mural making, illustration, ceramics, block printing, and photography. See www.neryorellana.com.

SHIPPING AND HANDLING
In order to give you the most competitive pricing on shipping, we will not be charging shipping and taxes through Indiegogo, but will be charging it closer to our delivery dates through BackerKit.  Shipping should be in the ballpark of $9 for U.S. orders and up to $13 for international. Extra decks are a minimal add on cost of about $3ea.  (See more in FAQ.)
 

RISKS & CHALLENGES
The lion's share of production prep is finished, but a large amount still remains in printing and packaging. My monetary goal and timeline are based off of pre-existing quotes with some extra padding in case of changes. I feel prepared. I am not new to manufacturing as I ran a boutique high end candy company for almost 20 years, and I've seen a brush fire or two in my day. I will communicate any such issues if they arise, along the way. This process should be really straight forward. That said, we are in unexplored territory with Covid-19, which has already created both production and shipping delays, so we do ask for understanding if necessary.
