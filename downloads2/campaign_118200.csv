<h2>The Story of <i>Natural Reflectors</i>
</h2>
<p><i>Natural Reflectors</i> explores the idea of how can we instill in our actions a mindset of intentional reflection taken from the power of nature’s cycles. We can look to nature for inspiration, but like any other new challenge, creating and working on your own process can feel awkward. With practice, we can make it part of our approach to everything. We can shift our mindset, play the long game, and become natural reflectors.<br/><br/>My name is Jennifer Peavey and I am the author of <i>Natural Reflectors</i>. Ultimately, I wrote this to show there are possibilities beyond what we have been taught and told and with that new perspective, I hope to help people think differently about how to connect with matters most in their lives.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover there is a world of inspiration to be found within nature; from how an apple comes to be, to the rhythm of tides, to our own breathing. What we learn can be applied to how we move through our days and lives. In this book, I hope to impart in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for developing your own process for how you will successfully accomplish any project, task or initiative you desire. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you stave off burnout, take control of your life, accomplish what matters to you and enjoy every minute of it.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about how our fast-paced culture discourages individuals from reflecting on where we are, what we have accomplished, and where we want to go. You will also learn how a healthy process must have both elements of reflection and action. You'll hear stories such as...</p>
<ul>
<li>Bill Burnett from Stanford’s Design Your Life Lab explain to us how we cannot make good decisions without listening to both our mind and body.</li>
<li>Stacy Levy, an environmental artist, who follows nature’s processes in urban environments to pull out the stories that surround each of us, so we have the chance to see it, appreciate it, consider it and maybe even learn something new from it.</li>
<li>Carl Honoré tell us how our behavior is heavily influenced by our definition of time.</li>
</ul>You will love this book if you have ever thought that there must be a better way to find meaning and purpose in your everyday life, if you are tired of living on autopilot, or if you are seeking a greater connection between yourself and the world around you.<br/><br/><i>Natural Reflectors</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to corporate employees feeling lost in the shuffle and are seeking some sense of control, entrepreneurs who are looking for focus, and creatives who want to take their thinking to a new level.<br/> <h2>The Book - <i>Natural Reflectors</i>
</h2>The book is written in three parts.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1 </strong>contains the introduction + chapters 1 - 4. This part will explore where we are in life today and how we got here. It is a hard part of the book that explores how we are addicted to action and how reflection is truly a good thing, but also why we are better off if reflection and action are used together to create a balance that only we can define and judge.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains chapters 5-8. This part will layout a set of principles of how to develop one’s own process. It begins with opening the mind to the idea that there are other ways of managing the various aspects in our lives and that nature has been managing these aspects beautifully long before we were put on this earth. This part will explore how to glean and nurture what insights nature has to offer.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> contains chapters 9 + conclusion. This part will be a first step in how to apply what we learn from nature’s insights and how to become a natural reflector.<br/> <h2>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h2>
<p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>editor</strong> I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in August 2021.</li>
<li>The <strong>cover design </strong>of my book. (The mockups you see currently are a placeholder!)</li>
<li>The <strong>layout design</strong> for the interior of my book (physical copy, ebook formats).</li>
<li>The <strong>copy editing</strong> for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.</li>
<li>The <strong>launch &amp; promotion efforts </strong>for my book when I ultimately publish this fall.</li>
</ul>
<p>When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish a paperback and ebook. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover edition and an audiobook.<br/><br/>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:</p>
<ul>
<li>You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish.</li>
<li>Your name will appear in the Acknowledgments section of my book.</li>
<li>You will receive early access to the Introduction and other excerpts from my book, with the opportunity to review them and give me early feedback.</li>
<li>You will have the opportunity to be involved in selecting my cover and title.</li>
<li>You will be invited to join my Author Community and get behind-the-scenes sneak peeks into the publishing process.</li>
<li>And much more!</li>
</ul> <h2>About the Author</h2>
<br/>Jennifer Peavey comes from a varied background of engineering, design and innovation. She has specialized in finding the common ground from these disparate fields and is known for making paradigm shattering connections between topics and groups that often do not interact.<br/><br/>In whatever she works on, Jennifer enjoys discovering and coming to understand the authenticity of people, products, and experiences. She finds that the most effective way of breaking through to the essence is to create tangible experiences where she and others can learn all the aspects of a problem, study or movement no matter what their background or biases. This book is her way of making not only her journey in developing her own process tangible, but to create a space for others to experience a taste of what it could be like to find new ways of thinking, doing and being for themselves.<br/><br/>Jennifer feeds this with a curiosity for learning new things and connecting with others in an authentic way. Her latest adventures have been in raising, training, and learning from her best friend, Lucy, the ultimate black Labrador, and in pursuing her lifelong dream of becoming a working artist.<br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Jennifer Peavey at jennifer.theblacklab@gmail.com and at jenniferpeavey on LinkedIn, @JenniferTheBlackLab on Instagram and Facebook and @peavey_jennifer on Twitter.<br/> <h2>International Preorders</h2> For international preorders, please send me a private message.<br/> <h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2> The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by including the cost of mailing and shipping the signed copies into each pre-order tier.<br/><br/>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we ship the pre-order rewards to you as early as possible. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as to when my book will publish. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.<br/> <h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please share my pre-sale campaign on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn with your friends, family and network. Please use #NaturalReflector and tag me as well as my publisher, New Degree Press, so that we can help amplify your efforts.</li>
<li>You can easily share my pre-sale campaign via Indiegogo at the top of the page.</li>
<li>Please share my book with 5 friends, family members, or co-workers who you think would enjoy it via text or direct message on social media.</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello friends! John Jairo Valencia and I, Nasha Minoo Katrack, are finally done illustrating and writing our first children's rhyme book ""Fern Boy.""</p>
<p>This children’s book (for ALL ages) is about self-discovery and plant ally-ship. Through Fernboy’s journey we see that we can find ourselves through nature, and we can look to nature for guidance on how to create social change all whilst cultivating a reciprocal relationship between ourselves and mama Earth.</p>
<p>As Adrienne Maree Brown says, ""Ferns and their fractal patterns are the inspiration to look for small-scale solutions that propagate outward and impact the whole environment.” Fernboy’s journey takes us through apathy, longing, urgency, joy and acceptance. It aims to encourage us to feel all of our feelings no matter how uncomfortable.</p>
<p>We would be so grateful for your support, it would mean so much to us.</p>
<p>With Gratitude, Nasha &amp; John</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We would love if you could help us birth this story into the world! We are seeking to raise $2,000 dollars in order to publish Fern Boy. This would help us pay for the formatting, printing, and distribution of our book.</p>
<ul>
<li>$1,000 - Printing + Binding 80 books</li>
<li>$400 - Packaging, shipping and distribution</li>
<li>$400 - Artist labor (audio book &amp; video production, illustration, writing &amp; editing)</li>
<li>$200 - Layout editing</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We believe Fern Boy is a book that will encourage both children &amp; adult's alike to connect with nature, build acceptance of their emotional-worlds, and expand their awareness of the interrelationship between themselves and the world. Though Fernboy's name has ""boy"" in it, this book was written and illustrated by two non-binary artists. We hope that this book will be a light for all the nonbinary children and adults out there. </p>

<p>My name is Lamar Smith and I am the author of Jack of All Trades: Rise of the Party Promoter. I wrote this book because I want people to embrace being themselves.

<h3>Who Am I?</h3>
<p>My name is Sarah and I am the author of a new children's book called <i>I Wish I Were A Superhero</i>. I'm a wife, a performer and a former children's entertainer who enjoys cosplay, roller skating and playing fetch with my dogs. I also really, really love superheroes.</p>
</div><div><p> </p></div><div>
<h3>My Little Superhero</h3>
<p>The idea for <i>I Wish I Were A Superhero </i>came from my love of superheroes and my admiration of the imagination of children. I feel that superheroes can show children a limitless amount of possibilities; ways for having strength and doing good. My hope is that my story can inspire children to explore all interests and work hard for their goals. And, of course, dinosaurs are cool.</p>
<p>I am partnering with the incredible illustrator Tara Lehning of taralehning.com to create the final book. I was instantly drawn to her gorgeous art style. I loved her pieces that displayed an effortless combination of realism with a cartoon innocence. She has a true mastery of anatomy, which gives the characters, and especially the lead dinosaur, the feeling of movement and excitement. I could not be more pleased with the pieces she has already created for the book and I cannot wait to see all of the final images!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>More About the Book</h3>
<p> <i>I Wish I Were A Superhero </i>features a young dinosaur (so cute, right?) that plays dress-up and acts out different possibilities for the type of superhero they could be. </p>
<p>The charming and perfectly child-like dinosaur design can fascinate children of all backgrounds as a universally appealing lead character. <br/><br/>The dinosaur explores options like physical strength, speed, intelligence and technology. Nothing is off limits! They can choose any path and be amazing. <br/><br/>The entire story is told in a charming rhyme, sure to be a fun read for the family!</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Unfortunately, writing a novel is the first mountain of several.  The road to getting published is daunting and arduous, and debut authors can struggle </span><i style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">for years </i><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">before getting their first novel published.  But there are ways to make the path easier--which is why I need <i>your </i>help. </span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Brief</b></span><b> Synopsis:  </b>""<i>Are You Okay? </i>"" is about Matt, a 31-year-old Brooklyn-based musician who thinks his life is wonderful.  His band just signed a record deal and the women keep getting hotter and hotter.  However, back at home, Matt's family is falling apart.  His dad is going crazy and his brother is raising two girls (aged 7 and 13) on his own.  </p>
<p>When his dad gets arrested for stealing a horse, Matt has to pack his bags and try to put things back together.  As he deals with his bipolar father, his depressed brother, and his two adorable but fragile nieces, Matt is haunted as he relives his painful childhood memories.  Oh yeah, and there's also a love story (of course): Matt returns to find that he's suddenly--and troublingly, given his lack of interest in monogamy--attracted to his oldest childhood friend, Julia.</p>
<p>""<i>Are You Okay?</i>"" is a full-length novel that will (hopefully) make you laugh out loud a bunch and cry (in a good way) once or twice.  <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Written with passion, pathos and pee-your-pants humor, (a la Nick Hornby, Dave Eggers and Jonathan Tropper), ""</span><i style=""background-color: initial;"">Are You Okay?</i><span style=""background-color: initial;"">"" is about music, masculinity, sexuality, addiction, mental illness, and above all, love and family.  </span></p> </div> <div> <h3>What Your Donations Will Help Me Get</h3> <p><b>How Publishing Works (Today): </b>In order to get a best-seller, you need a great publisher, and in order to get a great publisher, you need a great agent.  Getting a great agent is hard, ESPECIALLY for first time authors.  Your manuscript needs to be polished, you need to attend writer's workshops and you need a built-in marketing platform.  Which is where you come in.</p>
<p>Whether you can spare $5,000,000 or just $5, your contribution will be a HUGE help in what can be a very painful process.  Here's what your contribution will go towards: </p>
<p><b><u>Novel Coach/Manuscript Editor ($1,400)</u>:  </b>I've found a fantastic professional editor, Sarah Cypher at threepennyeditor.com, who provided me with a sample edit and did FANTASTIC work with the first few chapters.  I'm so excited to work with Sarah.  I'm confident that she will help take my novel to the next level.  Her services include in-depth line editing, a thorough, 15-page developmental critique, and pre-pubication services such as getting excerpts published in magazines.  This is the big one--these days, almost no debut novelist gets published without the help of a seasoned professional editor.</p>
<p><b><u>Santa Barbara Writers Conference (around $650)</u>: </b>Writers Conferences are a great way to meet with agents, other novelists, and publishers.  The best part of writers conferences is that authors get to meet face-to-face with agents who work in their genre and are actively looking for new authors.  If I don't raise the funds in time for the Santa Barbara Writers Conference (June 6th), there are several other conferences throughout the year, such as the S.F. Writers Conference (usually in early winter).  </p>
<p><b><u>Website/Marketing( $200-$500)</u>: </b>In order to build my ""marketing platform"", I need more of an online/social media presence.  Around $200 will help me get a great website, and anything I raise above that amount will help me direct higher traffic to websites like Twitter, Instagram, Goodreads and Amazon.  Having an impressive marketing platform can be the difference between getting a great agent and one who's simply adequate.  </p>
<p><b></b></p>
<h3><b>What <i>You </i>Get</b></h3>
<b> </b>I'm giving away plenty of goodies in exchange for your donations: signed copies of the novel, advance galley copies, music from the book, and even the chance to name one of the characters!<p></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>I really believe your contributions will help me take my book to the next level, which will make the process of getting published a <i>whole </i>lot less painful than it otherwise would be.  With your help, I believe ""<i>Are You Okay?</i>"" will be on the shelves in Spring or Summer of 2017.  If you love reading, love laughter, love tears, or just love me, then please donate whatever you can spare!</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>There is but one risk: I don't get published.  I have spent literally ONE MILLION HOURS working on this novel, and if I don't get published I will probably explode or something super dire like that.  </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you can't contribute, that's okay!  Here are some other ways you can help:</p> <ul> <li>Get  the word out and make some noise about my campaign.  Share on facebook, twitter, or just email to your friends or family.  </li> <li>Use the Indiegogo share tools!</li> </ul>
<div>Thanks again for your love and support!</div>

Santa Barbara Writers Conference (around $650): Writers Conferences are a great way to meet with agents, other novelists, and publishers.  The best part of writers conferences is that authors get to meet face-to-face with agents who work in their genre and are actively looking for new authors.  If I don't raise the funds in time for the Santa Barbara Writers Conference (June 6th), there are several other conferences throughout the year, such as the S.F. Writers Conference (usually in early winter).  
Website/Marketing( $200-$500): In order to build my ""marketing platform"", I need more of an online/social media presence.  Around $200 will help me get a great website, and anything I raise above that amount will help me direct higher traffic to websites like Twitter, Instagram, Goodreads and Amazon.  Having an impressive marketing platform can be the difference between getting a great agent and one who's simply adequate.  

What You Get
 I'm giving away plenty of goodies in exchange for your donations: signed copies of the novel, advance galley copies, music from the book, and even the chance to name one of the characters!
    The Impact I really believe your contributions will help me take my book to the next level, which will make the process of getting published a whole lot less painful than it otherwise would be.  With your help, I believe ""Are You Okay?"" will be on the shelves in Spring or Summer of 2017.  If you love reading, love laughter, love tears, or just love me, then please donate whatever you can spare!
    Risks & Challenges There is but one risk: I don't get published.  I have spent literally ONE MILLION HOURS working on this novel, and if I don't get published I will probably explode or something super dire like that.  
    Other Ways You Can Help If you can't contribute, that's okay!  Here are some other ways you can help:  Get  the word out and make some noise about my campaign.  Share on facebook, twitter, or just email to your friends or family.   Use the Indiegogo share tools! 
Thanks again for your love and support!
With your help, my dream of being a published novelist will hopefully come true!

Each package includes different perks that should fit the need of all authors,

For the last few years I've served as the pitch session coordinator for 
three horror writers conventions, two of which I was also a co-chair. So
 I've had
some solid experience seeing how hosting events operates from the

</div>","My name is R.J. Cavender and I love
working with writers and artists. 

That's why I'm hosting a writers retreat at the historic and
haunting Winchester Mystery House in beautiful San Jose, California - August 11th-13th, 2016. We'll be staying at the Dolce Hayes Mansion about a 20-minute drive from Winchester House, and it's just another amazing structure, a haunted hideaway place I'm excited to take my guests!  

If you want to join us, simply register by choosing a package here on this campaign and I'll send you the code to receive
the group discount rate when you make your hotel reservations. 

*Editing Packages and Event Registration does not include your hotel room or
transportation fees. Hotel room rates are listed at the bottom of the page.* 

But your registration does include all our group discount perks, select
editing packages, inclusion on any outings over the weekend, and a
guaranteed evening private group flashlight tour of the historic Winchester Mystery House in San Jose. 

Join us on our Facebook group page and help us plan the trip together for 2016: https://www.facebook.com/groups/485666841592733/We don't want to set a rigid
schedule or any programming that would take away from your writing time, since
this is a retreat and not a convention or conference. So no dealers room, and
very limited programming. Instead we're offering a unique experience with a great
group of authors and publishing professionals, in a fantastic spa resort, while visiting a location that's both beautiful and haunted with history. 

Each package includes different perks that should fit the need of all authors,
whether you're looking for some feedback and a polishing of your work...or
you're just needing a great place to write and get away. Let us host your
once-in-a-lifetime writing escape, and we'll promise you a great time in a
scenic and spooky locale. 

For the last few years I've served as the pitch session coordinator for 
three horror writers conventions, two of which I was also a co-chair. So
 I've had
some solid experience seeing how hosting events operates from the 
inside. And I put together the sort of trips I know I'd enjoy, inspirational ones that we'll all
remember for years to come. I hope you find this idea as exciting as I 
do, and
I truly hope you'll join us for this unique and haunting writing 
experience! The Winchester Mystery House is truly amazing...and the Dolce Hayes Mansion is truly a sight to behold, as well. Private evening group flashlight tour tickets for The Winchester Mystery House are available on different perk packages and we'll be visiting the mansion for our tour on Saturday August 13th, sometime after dark (time to be set soon by tour hosts.)

<p><br/>text Magazine is a bimonthly magazine available throughout Nanaimo, BC in coffee shops, bookstores, art supply stores, galleries, and more. It's constantly looking for ways to expand, and soon will be available in other cities across Canada.  It's completely free to read, professionally designed, and full of local and international talent.  <br/><br/>Shaleeta Harper from Vancouver Island University started and funded this project, and the first issue came out in September 2014 with lots of help from Philip Gordon, a fellow student.  The third issue, coming out in March 2014, is partially funded by Shaleeta, and partially by advertisers, but she's rapidly going broke, and the magazine can't be maintained without more advertising or more help from people interested in keeping the arts accessible. </p>
<p>We have hired a skilled advertising manager to help us find the funds for the project, but it will take a little while to make the connections with local businesses.  Also, next March we can apply for funding from the Canada Council for the Arts, and will no longer need to rely completely on advertising and other peoples generosity.  We work completely on a Volunteer basis, and keep running costs as low as possible. Our printer is working at a reduced rate to keep our costs down, and our Graphic Designer is giving us an excellent deal-- even our advertising manager is only working on commission. Regardless though, in print magazines cost quite a lot. </p>

</div><div> <p>The magazines bank account currently has 113.00 in it, from the 4000.00 balance Shaleeta donated at the beginning, and the advertisements we've sold over the past six months. Each issue costs about 2000.00, and we have two issues to go until we will have a stable groundwork of advertisers. <i>We do not pay ourselves</i>. We aren't a registered non-profit, but we do this on a completely Volunteer basis. Lets break these costs down a bit:</p> <ul> <li>Our Graphic Designer  works very hard to get everything just right, and we pay her about 350.00 each issue. We received many quotes, and this is an amazing<span style=""background-color: initial;""> deal for her talent. </span>
</li>
<li>Our Printer gives us a deal, but after taxes the cost is still approximately 1350.00 to cover paper, ink, and time. </li>
<li>Distribution. Mailing fees are high, and they just keep going up. We need to send a copy of the magazine to each contributor, and maintain levels in each of the local businesses. This costs stamps, envelopes, magazine stands, and transportation fees. This is a minimum of 200.00 an issue, or just 25.00 a week. </li>
<li>Other stuff. Websites, printing costs for advertising sheets, business cards, and banking fees all add up pretty quickly.  These run at least 100.00 an issue, and we haven't even signed up for a submission platform yet. </li>
</ul>
<div>If we can't reach our goal, we aren't giving up.  We'll get second jobs around school, or push an issue back a few weeks, or reduce advertising costs again... Any money raised won't go anywhere but this magazine. We want this to happen, and it will. We would just love a little extra help.<br/><br/>

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>You aren't just providing artistic reading material for people in Nanaimo who might not otherwise look at poetry and art, you're also helping artists and writers.  New and established authors and artists can submit their work to us, and gain valuable publishing credits, plus be read by more of the public. If we can branch out to larger cities, we can provide this service to more people.<br/><br/>Shaleeta and Philip have both worked on Portal magazine successfully in the past, and both are in their final years of the Creative Writing program at Vancouver Island University. </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Challenges to the magazine are many, but we've already surmounted most of them.  Getting acknowledgement and submissions is a big step, but we received nearly a thousand various submissions for issue two thanks to Philip Gordon's social media expertise. <br/><br/>Another hardship is finding places to distribute... but we've reached 16 locations in just two months, and are adding more every week or so. We've received only positive comments so far. <br/><br/>The biggest hurdle is funding.  Despite efforts to sell advertising, most companies use large companies to sell ads, rather than selling to small local businesses. We've been reaching out, and have some purchased, but nothing large enough to keep us going.  We have reached all the goals to receive funding from the Canada Council for the Arts, except for the length of time we've been publising. We just need to maintain the magazine until the application is accepted.  (March 1st 2016) <br/><br/></p>

Each issue costs about 2000.00, and we have two issues to go until we will have a stable groundwork of advertisers. We do not pay ourselves. We aren't a registered non-profit, but we do this on a completely Volunteer basis. Lets break these costs down a bit:  Our Graphic Designer  works very hard to get everything just right, and we pay her about 350.00 each issue. We received many quotes, and this is an amazing deal for her talent. 

Our Printer gives us a deal, but after taxes the cost is still approximately 1350.00 to cover paper, ink, and time. 
Distribution. Mailing fees are high, and they just keep going up. We need to send a copy of the magazine to each contributor, and maintain levels in each of the local businesses. This costs stamps, envelopes, magazine stands, and transportation fees. This is a minimum of 200.00 an issue, or just 25.00 a week. 
Other stuff. Websites, printing costs for advertising sheets, business cards, and banking fees all add up pretty quickly.  These run at least 100.00 an issue, and we haven't even signed up for a submission platform yet. 

If we can't reach our goal, we aren't giving up.  We'll get second jobs around school, or push an issue back a few weeks, or reduce advertising costs again... Any money raised won't go anywhere but this magazine. We want this to happen, and it will. We would just love a little extra help.

What you Get If you Donate:  

Pretty much whatever you want. We want to provide the kind of perks that you want to see, so feel free to send suggestions to textlitmag@gmail.com. Make Philip do a handstand on camera for 10.00 or something. We're game. 
If you have a business you would like to promote, we would also be happy to advertise it within our covers for a very reasonable rate. Please e-mail  textlitmag@gmail.com or shaleetaharper@gmail.com to discuss that. 


The Impact You aren't just providing artistic reading material for people in Nanaimo who might not otherwise look at poetry and art, you're also helping artists and writers.  New and established authors and artists can submit their work to us, and gain valuable publishing credits, plus be read by more of the public. If we can branch out to larger cities, we can provide this service to more people.Shaleeta and Philip have both worked on Portal magazine successfully in the past, and both are in their final years of the Creative Writing program at Vancouver Island University. 
    Risks & Challenges Challenges to the magazine are many, but we've already surmounted most of them.  Getting acknowledgement and submissions is a big step, but we received nearly a thousand various submissions for issue two thanks to Philip Gordon's social media expertise. Another hardship is finding places to distribute... but we've reached 16 locations in just two months, and are adding more every week or so. We've received only positive comments so far. The biggest hurdle is funding.  Despite efforts to sell advertising, most companies use large companies to sell ads, rather than selling to small local businesses. We've been reaching out, and have some purchased, but nothing large enough to keep us going.  We have reached all the goals to receive funding from the Canada Council for the Arts, except for the length of time we've been publising. We just need to maintain the magazine until the application is accepted.  (March 1st 2016)

<h2>Welcome to the <i>Senyaza Series</i>
</h2>
<p><br/><i>On our Earth, the Flood destroyed the nephilim. But in the Earth of Senyaza, the nephilim averted the Flood...</i></p>
<p>Welcome to the world of the <i>Senyaza Series</i>, where the illicit human-blooded offspring of angels and demons and gods have organized into the powerful Senyaza Corporation. Together they’ve worked for millennia to secretly protect humanity from the celestial powers that crave dominion, while securing themselves against an uncertain future. But after centuries of a supernatural status quo, the jagged wheels of fate have once again begun to turn, with two little girls as the winding key.</p>
<p>The children are sheltered, innocent, but those who recognize what they are will move mountains and burn cities to control them. Enter Marley Claviger: an ordinary woman who finds herself in an extraordinary position. When the girls come into her care, she must become the guardian of the children of revelation… no matter what she discovers.</p>
<p>To date, six volumes of the <i>Senyaza Series</i> have been released, with many more stories yet to come. Rather than following a single protagonist, the <i>Senyaza Series</i> is the story of a rapidly changing world. While it has many obvious elements of urban fantasy, as time passes, more and more cyberpunk and science fiction elements will (have already) come into play.</p>
<p>Some of the protagonists are nephilim. Some are human, some are monsters. A few of them are something else. All of them are interesting, complex characters with unique voices you'll enjoy hearing in audiobook format.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We're producing, at the very least, the audiobook of <i>Matchbox Girls,</i> the first volume of the <i>Senyaza Series</i>.  That's Marley's first book and you can see above for an idea of what it's about!</p>
<p>The basic perk for this fundraiser is a previously-Patreon-exclusive short story from the Senyaza universe, presented in audio and ebook format. Both the short story audio and the full-length audiobook(s) will be narrated by <a href=""https://sarahsampino.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sarah Sampino</a>. The funding goal represents what's required to pay for her narration and the first audiobook's production. Practically speaking, some percentage of the funding will go to perk fulfillment, but what percentage depends on you!<br/><br/>Further funding will go toward promoting the first audiobook and producing later books. While exact values vary based on fulfillment requirements, if we reached $10,000, I believe that would cover all six books currently released.<br/><br/>Other available perks include:</p>
<ul>
<li>(Limited) A free copy of the <i>Matchbox Girls</i> audiobook once it's complete.</li>
<li>I make digital art! I'll do a Senyaza-related commission for you and send you a high quality print! Or you can choose a print of previous (Senyaza and unrelated) works! <a href=""https://www.deviantart.com/exstarsis/gallery"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Here's a gallery</a>. </li>
<li>I write! I'll write a short story about the Senyaza character or characters of your choice.</li>

<li>Step aboard! Get all six of the Senyaza ebooks in the format of your choice for a limited-time low price!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I love audiobooks, and more and more, I'm not alone. For many people, it's the primary way they keep reading good books in a busy life. The Senyaza stories are fun and entertaining reads with depth, and I'm excited about bringing them to a whole new audience. Your help will keep this ship sailing.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>If something comes up, I'll do my best to get perks out in a timely fashion anyhow. Not only have I already made arrangements with Sarah for the audio, I've researched printers for the art and tested out the shipping line for the paperbacks. Production prices may change, but I've planned some flex in my costs too. We can do this!</p>

<h3>Goal Reached... Now What?</h3>
<p>In the spirit of the holidays, I have two announcements about the “All Ways” campaign to make! ☃️ <br/><br/>In the spirit of giving, I will be donating 50% of all funds over my goal to the charity <a href=""https://autisticadvocacy.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ASAN (Autistic Self-Advocacy Network)</a>. ASAN’s goal is to empower Autistic people to take control of their individual lives as well as providing a space to organize as part of a common community that needs to be a part of the disability rights conversation. ?<br/><br/>In the spirit of laughter, if I raise $8,000 in my Indiegogo campaign, I will film myself reading a chapter of “All Ways” while eating hot pepper. ?️ Those of you who know me know that I am famously a “Plain Jane” when it comes to the food I eat, (Yes, I will order a non-toasted plain bagel.) so this will probably blow my taste buds out. ?</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<i>All Ways</i> is about two brothers, York and Andreas, who go on a cross-country road trip together. Both brothers are coming to terms with how they feel about “adulthood” in different ways and building upon their sibling bond before they part ways, as York goes off to college in the fall. While on their journey, they’ll also be grappling with a “missing piece” of themselves that they’ll never find: their Autistic identity. To its core, this book is about their sibling relationship, finding their independence, and growing up without knowing an important piece about themselves. <br/><br/>My name is Kelly Coons and I am the author of <i>All Ways</i>, which is inspired largely by my late diagnosis of autism. I wrote this book because:<ul>
<li>When I was a kid, most of the books I was recommended about autism were really just about a neurotypical character “learning something” from an Autistic person. They usually weren’t about the Autistic person or even autism in general, and I wanted to go against that narrative by having Autistic characters front and center in this story. </li>
<li>The Autistic characters I was introduced to typically already had their diagnosis and the tools they needed to help understand how they interact with the world. Diagnosis as a child is not typical for many Autistic people, including women, non-binary people, and people of color. Early diagnosis is a privilege that not everyone has access to, and I wanted to reflect that in this book (especially since that was my own personal experience).</li>
<li>I wanted to tackle some well-known stereotypes about Autistic people and show how they can inflict harm — like how the “genius” trope creates a very hard standard for Autistic people to live up to.</li>
<li>I think, during this era of racial reckoning, people are cognizant (or forced to be cognizant) of their implicit biases. Thus, I think this is a great time to share this book to start a dialogue and tackle peoples’ biases about autism and Autistic people. </li>
</ul>
<br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will learn about the rich interpersonal lives of Autistic people and reevaluate your own biases about autism. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to learn alongside York and Andreas as their relationships evolve and they discover more about who they are.<br/><br/>You’ll follow big brother York as he plans and executes a road trip for his younger brother, Andreas—who loves maps!—to visit the college he’ll be attending in the fall. They’ll be making a long trek from Ridgecrest, California all the way to Albany, New York, with tons of stops along the way! York is afraid of leaving his brother for four years and really wants this road trip to be a way for them to bond before they’re separated. Also, they want prove a point to their mother—who thinks they’re way over their heads—that they can do this. On this road trip, they’ll make new friends, confront painful memories, and learn how to transition into their new lives apart and plan for their future together. Of course, the kicker is neither of them have been diagnosed with autism yet—they know they’re “different” (like Andreas being non-verbal), but they don’t know why—and that provides some challenges as they navigate this cross-country adventure together. <br/><br/>You will love this book if you identify as Autistic or love an Autistic person, you’re itching to go on a fun road trip, or you have a soft spot for wholesome family bonding.<br/><br/><i>All Ways</i> speaks to teens and people in the Autistic community who want to grapple with autism and interpersonal relationships in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>All Ways</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:<ul>
<li>How are sibling bonds shaped by abusive/neglectful parents?</li>
<li>How does one seek community when they lack language about their identity?</li>
<li>How does autism and toxic notions about masculinity intersect?</li>
<li>How do Autistic people interact with each other and other people?</li>
<li>Can a book “about autism” really be about autism when the characters don’t know they are Autistic?</li>
</ul>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing autism and interpersonal relationships will change us all for the better. <br/> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3>This book will be published with New Degree Press.

<h3>HOW DID THIS RACE START?</h3>
<p>Writing is our passion, and after we became parents of a baby born with a CHD (Congenital Heart Defect) and needing an open heart surgery at 4 days old, everything became more meaningful. Writing stories for children became our new focus. We were running too much and going too fast, but this cause slowed us down! Creativity and imagination are great ways to bond with kids and help them develop their skills. That's our mission!</p>
<p> <u><strong>THE STORY</strong></u></p>
<p><font><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Once a year in the Seasons' World, a big race is held. Each season has its own racer: Annie Springs, Sam Summers, Kim Falls and Will Winters. During the race, one of the racers will have to choose between winning or saving their world...</span></font></p>
<p> <u><strong>THE CHARACTERS</strong></u></p>
<p><strong>Annie</strong> is a colorful bunny and she drives an Easter basket car, she represents <u>Spring</u>. </p>

Writing is our passion, and after we became parents of a baby born with a CHD (Congenital Heart Defect) and needing an open heart surgery at 4 days old, everything became more meaningful. Writing stories for children became our new focus. We were running too much and going too fast, but this cause slowed us down! Creativity and imagination are great ways to bond with kids and help them develop their skills. That's our mission!
 THE STORY
Once a year in the Seasons' World, a big race is held. Each season has its own racer: Annie Springs, Sam Summers, Kim Falls and Will Winters. During the race, one of the racers will have to choose between winning or saving their world...
 THE CHARACTERS
Annie is a colorful bunny and she drives an Easter basket car, she represents Spring. 
Kim is a pumpkin-headed girl who drives a Thanksgiving Turkey car, representing Autumn.
Sam  is a sun-headed boy with palm tree hair who drives a Dolphin car, representing Summer. 
Will is a snowman with reindeer ears and Santa-inspired clothing who drives a Christmas tree car, representing Winter.

<h2><strong>The Book - Lead The Future</strong></h2>
<br/>The book is written in 4 Parts....<br/><br/>Part One- Covers the story of an unconventional, revolutionary leader who you likely have never heard of.

<h3>THIS GIRL IS SUPER</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Hello culture vultures! </p>
<p>My name is Tree, and amongst the variety of paths I've taken in my life - Musician, Dreaming Guide, Death Doula and Tarot Reader - I also danced down the acid and amphetamine path as a young club kid from 1990-1995.</p>
<p>Recently I was going through a bunch of old boxes and crates in my house, and I unearthed all of my old club land rave scrapbooks and photo albums. As I sat laughing and reminiscing over the wildly colourful fashions , bugged out expressions and enlarged pupils of the ravers in my collection, It dawned on me that these photos were of some value. I had captured a glimpse of the underground 90's club scene, unique fashion tribe and youth culture that really hasn't been too well documented as this was pre-internet, pre-smart phone, and pre-digital cameras! </p>
<p>As a young raver between 1990 - 1995, I would bring disposable cameras to clubs, raves and festivals and document the colourful and creative kids that would attend. Travelling around the North American rave circuit,  I snapped images of club kids throughout North America including: NYC, Toronto, Tucson and Montreal. I chose to bring plastic disposable cameras because often I would end up on some kind of trip and end up losing the damn things!  But the disposable cameras that did survive the night would end up getting developed and I could then recall all the moments of drug fuelled bliss, ecstatic dancing and the rough comedowns. Once the film was developed , I would then cut out the images of the ravers and glue them on cosmic backgrounds that I found in science magazines. This was pre-Photoshop!  This analogue collage effect was the only way in which I could capture the feel and spirit of the time: spaced out kids looking to escape the cynical world into a cartoon cosmic universe.</p>

<p><strong>Thanks to you, our supporters, this </strong><strong>crowdfunder</strong><strong> has reached its target!</strong></p>
<p>We really appreciate all your support.</p>
<p>But <strong>we want to do more</strong>, so we are adding a stretch target for our campaign </p>
<p>If we can raise another <strong>£300</strong> and get to <strong>120%</strong> of our initial funding goal we would have the funds to record a dual language audio version of the poem.</p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>The Somali poet <strong>Weedhsame</strong> and his poet translator <strong>Daljit Nagra</strong> will be together in the UK this October. This gives us a unique opportunity to make an audio recording of 'Catastrophe' featuring the voices of these two poets.</span></p>
<p>If we are successful and reach this stretch goal we will make the recorded poem available for free online for everyone to enjoy.</p>
<p>So if you haven’t joined in yet it's not too late, or if you have donated and you want to help us get the project to the next level this is your chance.</p>
<p>Even penny you donate helps us bring this awe inspiring poem to new audiences across the UK.</p>
<p>Read more about this awe inspiring poem below.</p>
<p><strong>You are people who can succeed.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You are people who can build a home.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You are people in your own right.</strong></p>
<p>Catastrophe is an electrifying poem by the Somali poet <strong>Xasan Daahir </strong><strong>Weedhsame</strong>. A howl of anguish about the displacement of the Somali people, it offers a provocation to western Europe, unable to hold focus on the devastating refugee crisis playing out on our shores, and a message of hope to all who have had to flee their homes to seek sanctuary across the sea.</p>
<p>In October the <strong>Poetry Translation Centre</strong> will publish <i>Catastrophe</i> as a dual-language poem-poster, including a dazzling English translation by British poet <strong>Daljit Nagra</strong> and scholar <strong>Martin Orwin</strong>. The poster will also feature a specially commissioned illustration by the artist <strong>Bryan Talbot</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>How can you help?</strong></p>
<p>We want to get this poem into the hands of as many people as possible, particularly young people. Our translation and artist costs are supported by Arts Council England, our core funder, but we need your support to get this unique project to the printer!</p>
<p>Our initial target is <strong>£1,500</strong> - this will enable us to print 500 copies. Every pound raised over this target will help us to reach more schools up and down the country with reading copies and classroom resources.</p>
<p><strong>What rewards are we offering?</strong></p>
<p>You can choose a perk by hovering over the descriptions on the right-hand side of this page. The simplest way to help is by <strong>pre-ordering</strong> your own copy of <i>Catastrophe</i> for £7 that we will post out to you on the day of publication. For <strong>£15</strong> we are also offering invitations to our <strong>launch event</strong> in London, featuring <strong>Weedhsame</strong> and <strong>Daljit Nagra</strong>.</p>
<p>You can order a <strong>Somali poetry package</strong> for <strong>£50</strong>, which includes <i>Catastrophe</i>, two PTC chapbooks, a book on Somalia’s greatest living poet <strong>Maxamed Ibraahin Warsame Hadraawi</strong>, and a new collection (hot off the press!) by UK-based poet <strong>Asha Lul Mohamud Yusuf</strong>. This is a great way to discover a rich, living poetic tradition.</p>

<p><i>Catastrophe</i> was written about the ‘<strong>Tahriib</strong>’ or sea migration, the search for a better life in another country.

<p><strong>The Poetry Translation Centre</strong> has been translating poetry from around the world into English for over ten years. We have a solid track record of finding the most significant poets from across the globe. We work collaboratively with leading translators and the best UK poets to introduce these unheard voices to English-speaking audiences.</p>
<p>With this project, the biggest challenge we face is helping the poem find its audience. Working with <strong>Daljit Nagra</strong>, <strong>Martin Orwin</strong> and  <strong>Bryan Talbot</strong>, all big names in their fields, will help us reach more people. We have strong ties with the Somali community and will be running events with the poets and Bryan Talbot in October to help get the word out.</p>
<p><strong>What if we fall short of the target?</strong></p>
<p>If we don’t reach our full funding target we will still be able to use your contribution to fund a <strong>smaller print run</strong> and hold workshops with <strong>Weedhsame</strong> when he visits the UK in October for Somali Week.</p>

</div></div>","Thanks to you, our supporters, this crowdfunder has reached its target!
We really appreciate all your support.
But we want to do more, so we are adding a stretch target for our campaign 
If we can raise another £300 and get to 120% of our initial funding goal we would have the funds to record a dual language audio version of the poem.
The Somali poet Weedhsame and his poet translator Daljit Nagra will be together in the UK this October. This gives us a unique opportunity to make an audio recording of 'Catastrophe' featuring the voices of these two poets.
If we are successful and reach this stretch goal we will make the recorded poem available for free online for everyone to enjoy.
So if you haven’t joined in yet it's not too late, or if you have donated and you want to help us get the project to the next level this is your chance.
Even penny you donate helps us bring this awe inspiring poem to new audiences across the UK.
Read more about this awe inspiring poem below.
You are people who can succeed.
You are people who can build a home.
You are people in your own right.
Catastrophe is an electrifying poem by the Somali poet Xasan Daahir Weedhsame. A howl of anguish about the displacement of the Somali people, it offers a provocation to western Europe, unable to hold focus on the devastating refugee crisis playing out on our shores, and a message of hope to all who have had to flee their homes to seek sanctuary across the sea.
In October the Poetry Translation Centre will publish Catastrophe as a dual-language poem-poster, including a dazzling English translation by British poet Daljit Nagra and scholar Martin Orwin. The poster will also feature a specially commissioned illustration by the artist Bryan Talbot.
How can you help?
We want to get this poem into the hands of as many people as possible, particularly young people. Our translation and artist costs are supported by Arts Council England, our core funder, but we need your support to get this unique project to the printer!
Our initial target is £1,500 - this will enable us to print 500 copies. Every pound raised over this target will help us to reach more schools up and down the country with reading copies and classroom resources.
What rewards are we offering?
You can choose a perk by hovering over the descriptions on the right-hand side of this page. The simplest way to help is by pre-ordering your own copy of Catastrophe for £7 that we will post out to you on the day of publication. For £15 we are also offering invitations to our launch event in London, featuring Weedhsame and Daljit Nagra.
You can order a Somali poetry package for £50, which includes Catastrophe, two PTC chapbooks, a book on Somalia’s greatest living poet Maxamed Ibraahin Warsame Hadraawi, and a new collection (hot off the press!) by UK-based poet Asha Lul Mohamud Yusuf. This is a great way to discover a rich, living poetic tradition.
Become a Poem Seeder for £100: get all these other benefits, plus we will provide a UK-based class or youth group with a set of Catastrophe poem-posters and reading resources on your behalf.
We will also be offering Bryan Talbot’s original artwork and sketches for pledges between £30 and £350. Bryan Talbot has been described as the ‘David Bowie of British Comics’ and his sticking artwork has appeared in 2000AD, Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight, Neil Gaiman’s Sandman and in the Costa Award-winning Dotter Of Her Father’s Eyes. His next artwork could be hanging on your wall.
Why is this project so important?
Last year when images of the mass migration began to fill the UK news Weedhsame’s poem took on a new significance.
Catastrophe was written about the ‘Tahriib’ or sea migration, the search for a better life in another country. This perilous journey is familiar to most Somalis living in Europe, and its impact looms large in Somali Culture. Weedhsame’s poem has resonated with Somali audiences at home and in the diaspora, cementing his reputation as one of the finest poets of his generation.
By capturing this story, laying out both the human tragedies and great national cost of this mass migration, Catastrophe offers a vital new perspective to the ongoing refugee crisis.
This poem gives a voice to the nameless people we see in news reports about mass migration.
Getting this poem out to young people and a range of communities across the UK will help reawaken awareness of the biggest mass migration of people Europe has seen since the second World War.
Sounds good. Can you pull it off?
We need to get the word out far and wide to get this project to reach our funding goal. Much of this project is already secure: the poem itself and Daljit and Martin's translation is already complete, while Bryan is hard at work on the artwork.

<p>As queer Arabs / Arab Americans, many people and institutions attempt to

through society with parts of ourselves made hyper-visible, and others
invisible. At Split This Rock we will share our stories from our own perspectives
and experiences.  Through the sharing of our poetry and the questions we
wrestle with in our lives and creative work, we hope to connect with folks from
many varied communities, including other artists of color, queer folks and
allies.  </p>
<p>Many of us share similar histories of negotiating multiple identities,
colonization, intersecting oppressions and displacements. Our presentation will
create a space for participants to reflect on their own histories and
identities. Through this collective act of witnessing, and shared reflection,
we hope to build a sense of compassion and connection between us and all
attendees, which we will bring back with us into our communities as we work
towards recognition and social justice.</p>

El impacto

En el último año, logramos tener 200 personas inscritas en las distintas categorías y una población de poco más de 4 mil personas que participaron  disfrutando el espectáculo.  
El festival apuesta a una convivencia que resalta, el trabajo comunitario, colectivo, la dignidad, creatividad y vínculos inter generacionales entre la niñez, juventud y las personas adultas, al mismo tiempo, es una fiesta que abona a la disminución de los problemas sociales y rescata los valores como como comunidad autónoma  respeto, la igualdad, seguridad, el arte, entre otros. 


Impact

The hot air balloon Festival is the only festival in Mexico driven within an indigenous autonomous region. Each year we look for the festival to be more recognized with an increase in community participation.
In the past year, we had 200 people enrolled in the different categories and a population of just over 4000 people who participated enjoying the show.
Our festival tries to highlighting the coexistence, community  and collective work, dignity, creativity and intergenerational links between children, youth and adults at the same time. The festival is a party that contributes to the reduction of social problems and rescues our autonomous community values ​​such as respect, equality, security, art, among many others.

    Riesgos y desafíos  
Al ser Cherán una comunidad autónoma en resistencia, buscamos que las actividades culturales y artísticas sean parte de la dinámica comunitaria y no actividades impuestas desde afuera. Por lo que buscar de manera independiente y autónoma los recursos para su realización es un desafío permanente. 
En otros años hemos tenido limitaciones para tener los premios completos o buscar apoyos en especie, pero este es nuestro primer año que queremos que la comunidad fuera de Cherán, las personas como tú, interesadas en apoyar procesos comunitarios en resistencia puedan también poner su ""granito de arena"".El riesgo de no completar nuestra meta, es que tendremos o premios simbólicos o menos insumos para los Globos de Cantoya, pero a pesar, de ello, podremos realizar el 11º festival. 

Risks and challenges.
Cheran being an autonomous community in resistance,we seek and think that cultural and artistic activities are part of our own dynamic in the community  and they are not imposed from outside. By trying to obtain in an independent and autonomous way the resources for the festival we face an ongoing and permanent challenge.

During the past years we have had limitations to fund the awards and to obtain different kind of materials, but this is our first year that we want that the community outside of Cheran, people like you, interested in supporting community processes in resistance, help us, With little help from everyone we will accomplish our goal.
The risk of not completing our goal is that either we are going to give symbolic prizes or have less materials for the making of hot air balloons, but despite this, we  still can make the 11th festival.

I was born with a rare syndrome called Polands, with this I was born with a smaller left hand side, a turned in left hip and no left pec major. From this my left breast never developed. Growing up in a society of wanting to look beautiful and be 'perfect' I was totally ashamed of who I was and lived the first 28 years of my life lying. Over the past 4 years, I have been through a transformational journey and am now filled with true joy and bliss leading an authentic path. I feel a calling to share my personal story and even more the tools I have used to face my fears, my guilt, shame and how I could come to the other side saying 'This is who I am' love me as I am. When I have shared my story at public speaking events I have helped both woman and men to connect to the stories they are ashamed of and help them to feel empowered by their imperfections. I am hoping to raise a minimum of $8000 so I can cover the costs of a writing retreat in Queensland and the costs to publish the book.

<p>The Big(ish) Book of (somewhat) Hilarious Poems is a collection of poems my writing partner and I have done. We are planning to use these poems to publish an illustrated book, complete with a recorded CD in the back.</p>
<p>This is where it gets interesting – we are going to get UK comedians to record the poems to make it really interesting (and commercially viable).</p>
<p>The book will support the Great Ormond Street Children’s Hospital in London – our main goal is to combine our love of writing with our passion for social change.</p>
<p>So far we have approached several celebrity agents and have some people onboard (in principle at least).</p>
<p>To ensure the best possibility of success for the project, we will be using about 6 of the poems and illustrations to create a pitch book. We will get a good 30 of these printed and distributed to some of the bigger publishing houses in the UK.</p>
<p>The only issue is that given a pitch book needs to look and feel as close to the final product as possible, we need someone to help us finance the print costs – around $2000.</p>

<p>Taruni's journey of healing has been one of those experiences that touches many lives along the way. In dealing with the loss of her husband from cancer she has moved half way across the world; written and self-published a book on death and grieving; volunteers at hospice, offering patient care and bereavement support; and is also running a free-twice-monthly grief support group in Manhattan.</p>
<p>Now she is writing a book for commercial publication titled - A good day to die.  This book will describe in more detail the experience of caring for her terminally ill husband, the dying process, and the healing journey after his passing. To accompany this book, will be a handbook on grieving, intended as a resource for professionals working in the area of bereavement and for the bereaved. </p>
<p>I am launching this campaign to help her write this book.</p>
<p>My goal is to send Taruni and her late husband’s ashes to
India and then to Australia at the end of this year. I feel strongly that this trip
represents a cycle of completion for Taruni in the life long process of
grieving. And I feel that it needs to be now because she is embarking on these writing projects</p>
<p>I want to help ensure that this book gets written and this trip is the next stage of her story. Her book will help and support thousands of people who struggle with reality of loss. </p>

<p>Since that time of loss and trauma, I have seen her grow and

publishing house with the help of some generous contributors through our previous crowdfunding campaign. This year we have published 4 anthologies of poetry, 2 collections of poetry by new
writers, and a collection of short fiction. Also, soon, we have our
first novels by new writers coming out.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Our ethos from the start of this adventure in publishing has
always been that we will help nurture new writing talent by actively seeking it out, and giving a chance to writers who may otherwise find it difficult to get their work off the ground and into the public eye.</p>
<p>In an
industry where  new writers are feeling increasingly isolated from
major publishers, and self-publishing is not for every writer, we feel that there has to be a middle ground
wherein new writers who want to choose traditional publishing as an outlet for their artistic vision can do so, without having to expend more time and energy (or money) than they can spare. That's where we, and other
independent publishers come in.</p>
<p>Our passion for literature is in everything we do. We think that there are some undiscovered gems out there in the desert of literature, and we're determined to find and nurture it. However, passion isn't enough, we also need to have the funds to do more for our writers. This is where you come in.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have worked out our needs to get things off the ground properly - £5,000. This is mostly for a marketing and promotion budget, so that we can get the publications out there into the eyes of the public through advertising, media and reviewers. </p>
<p>There are also incremental costs we will need to cover as time goes on, but it is hoped that with a decent marketing and promotional budget, we will be able to increase the sales of our titles, and then this should mean we can do much more as time goes on. </p>
<p>Of course, if we break through the £5,000 target, we can start looking at putting that money to much more use. So, the more we get the more we can do.</p>
<h3>Perks</h3>
<p>We have a collection of unique perks for you, from a mention on our site as a sponsor, through perks which give you all our current, and future, publications in a format of your choice, to an editorial service for all you aspiring novelists out there, to our exclusive contributors-only T-shirts (with the great design of our sci-fi collection ""Tuned To A Dead Channel"") there is something for everyone in our perks. So take a look at them, and see what you can get for supporting us.</p>

I'm trying to raise money to help cover travel expenses to give readings in promotion of my second collection of poetry, <i>Humanly</i>, which will be coming out from Small Doggies Press this March. I will be going to Portland, OR; Seattle, WA; Chicago, IL; and potentially elsewhere. Up to date information on my tour schedule can be found on my website: <a href=""www.stevietheclumsy.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.stevietheclumsy.com</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>This book is largely about living with Bipolar II Disorder, living through grief and trauma, and trying to redirect patterns of suicidal ideation. </span><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>T</span><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>here were several points at which I debated the publication of this collection due to how scary and irreversible it is to publicly acknowledge having a mental illness. However, enough people have told me that reading my words has helped them through hard times that I believe this book is necessary. If this book saves one person's life, then it was more than worth the three years I spent writing it. I want to make sure that it reaches the people who might need it.  That's where I need your help! I need money to help cover travel expenses so that I can give readings from this collection in places beyond my current home base (Ithaca, NY). </span></p>
<p><span>I'm more than happy to sleep on couches and eat crumbs while traveling, but what I really need money for is airfare (specifically: a flight from Ithaca, NY to Portland, OR; a flight from Portland, OR to Chicago, IL; and a flight back to Ithaca, NY). </span><span>It's true that some of the readings I do will pay small amounts of money, and hopefully I'll sell tons of books and make some additional money—That'd be really awesome! However,</span><span> poetry is unfortunately not the biggest money-making industry in America, and I am not currently in a financial situation where I can gamble with going into the red for this tour. My checking account balance has stopped showing numbers and now just shakes its head at me in disappointment. </span></p>
<div><span><br/></span></div>
</div><div><b>So, is this book actually any good?</b></div><p><span>I'm excited that some of the poets I most admire are already saying wonderful things about <i>Humanly</i>:</span></p><div><span><blockquote>With an unpredictability that alternately jolts and mesmerizes, Stevie Edwards has crafted an intricate exploration of life as we'd rather not know it. There is much in these stanzas to jolt and unsettle--stark crafting and a relentless respect for the possibilities of word create a tension only felt in the presence of revelation. <br/>—Patricia Smith, Author of <i>Blood Dazzler</i> and <i>Shoulda Been Jimi Savannah</i>
</blockquote>
<p><br/></p>
<blockquote>In<i> Humanly</i>, Stevie Edwards wakes us into our own bodies with her fierce honesty: ""The first time I tried to slip my outsides/I failed."" This is a courageous book of startling images and original voice that surges beyond the difficult questions: ""If I string the night between two fence posts,/one side heaven and one side hell…"" Or: ""I was/watching myself in the hotel mirror to make sure/my body was still happening…"" Edwards blows the doors off the outer body, delivering us to the beating heart and the inner doors of human mercy. Humanly burns need and desire into the sound of survival: ""a prayer/in praise of the groaning in the back room:/Let each body be loved until its end. <br/>—Jan Beatty, Author of <i>Red Sugar</i> and <i>The  Switching/Yard</i>
</blockquote>
<p><br/></p>
<blockquote>If I had never before heard anyone say ""Art Saves Lives,"" I swear on the bullseye of my own wrist, I would have run through the streets screaming it the moment I finished this book. I want everyone who has never believed in the possibility of being given back Time, to read these poems. Not a moment of grief denied, and still, each turn of the page, a vaulted ceiling in my heavy heart. What a generous and intensely vulnerable offering to our survival this book is. <br/>—Andrea Gibson, Author of<i> Pole Dancing to Gospel Hymns</i> and <i>The Madness Vase</i>

This book is largely about living with Bipolar II Disorder, living through grief and trauma, and trying to redirect patterns of suicidal ideation. There were several points at which I debated the publication of this collection due to how scary and irreversible it is to publicly acknowledge having a mental illness. However, enough people have told me that reading my words has helped them through hard times that I believe this book is necessary. If this book saves one person's life, then it was more than worth the three years I spent writing it. I want to make sure that it reaches the people who might need it.  That's where I need your help! I need money to help cover travel expenses so that I can give readings from this collection in places beyond my current home base (Ithaca, NY). 
I'm more than happy to sleep on couches and eat crumbs while traveling, but what I really need money for is airfare (specifically: a flight from Ithaca, NY to Portland, OR; a flight from Portland, OR to Chicago, IL; and a flight back to Ithaca, NY). It's true that some of the readings I do will pay small amounts of money, and hopefully I'll sell tons of books and make some additional money—That'd be really awesome! However, poetry is unfortunately not the biggest money-making industry in America, and I am not currently in a financial situation where I can gamble with going into the red for this tour. My checking account balance has stopped showing numbers and now just shakes its head at me in disappointment. 

So, is this book actually any good?I'm excited that some of the poets I most admire are already saying wonderful things about Humanly:With an unpredictability that alternately jolts and mesmerizes, Stevie Edwards has crafted an intricate exploration of life as we'd rather not know it. There is much in these stanzas to jolt and unsettle--stark crafting and a relentless respect for the possibilities of word create a tension only felt in the presence of revelation. —Patricia Smith, Author of Blood Dazzler and Shoulda Been Jimi Savannah


In Humanly, Stevie Edwards wakes us into our own bodies with her fierce honesty: ""The first time I tried to slip my outsides/I failed."" This is a courageous book of startling images and original voice that surges beyond the difficult questions: ""If I string the night between two fence posts,/one side heaven and one side hell…"" Or: ""I was/watching myself in the hotel mirror to make sure/my body was still happening…"" Edwards blows the doors off the outer body, delivering us to the beating heart and the inner doors of human mercy. Humanly burns need and desire into the sound of survival: ""a prayer/in praise of the groaning in the back room:/Let each body be loved until its end. —Jan Beatty, Author of Red Sugar and The  Switching/Yard


If I had never before heard anyone say ""Art Saves Lives,"" I swear on the bullseye of my own wrist, I would have run through the streets screaming it the moment I finished this book. I want everyone who has never believed in the possibility of being given back Time, to read these poems. Not a moment of grief denied, and still, each turn of the page, a vaulted ceiling in my heavy heart. What a generous and intensely vulnerable offering to our survival this book is. —Andrea Gibson, Author of Pole Dancing to Gospel Hymns and The Madness Vase

Also, I encourage you to read some of my poems yourself and make up your own mind. Here's a few places where you can find poems from the collection published online:




Solstice  - ""In the Psych Ward""


Devil's Lake - ""Against Ghosts""


Word Riot - ""Humanly""


Gesture  - 5 Poems


Vinyl  - ""Fabulousness""


NAILED - 5 Poems


B O D Y - ""Dear John,""

So, is this Stevie Edwards person a total deadbeat or something?I'm currently a Lecturer in the English Department at Cornell University, an Online Instructor at Writers & Books, Acquisitions Editor at YesYes Books, and Editor-in-Chief at Muzzle Magazine. I also write as much as possible, travel to give readings, and occasionally sleep and socialize. I have an MFA from Cornell University and a BA from Albion College. I have a five-year-plan involving being financially stable enough to own a puggle. So, I think this sounds cool but I'm also a brokeass poet (or can't/ don't want to donate for other reasons that are none of your business), what can I do?Please help spread the word! Share this campaign with friends. Share a line from one of my poems that stuck with you on social media. If you write book reviews, I'd also be happy to send a pre-release electronic copy of the book. All press is good press. If you bought my first book and liked it, give it a good review on Amazon or GoodReads. If you know any poetry organizers, give them my name to help set up a reading. There's lots of ways to help support a writer that aren't monetary (although, money is really helpful). So, what happens if you raise over $1000?Well, after I finish popping a bottle of Andre, I'll work on booking more shows in additional cities across the US!So, why didn't you make a video?Because my MacBook Pro broke this week and I'm using a really cruddy old laptop from when I was in undergrad. I'm going to try and add a video when I get my Mac back from the repair shop (hopefully soon).",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</h2>
<p>(Note: don't forget to check the Updates tab above!)</p>
<p>Napism.info is a little book, and a simple website, for people who get teased about taking naps . . . and for people who like to tease other people about taking naps.  You can have some great fun with this!  I know, because this little book is a compilation of about 5 years worth of jokes among my family and friends.  (Note my Nap Master certificate, gold-seal embossed and signed by the Dalai Napa himself!)<img alt=""Nap Master Certificate"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.stoneandlight.com/Napism/NMT_small.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;"" title=""Nap Master Certificate""/></p>
<p>So, that’s the reason for the book.  The reason for the website is so that readers out there can add their jokes to the eventual <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">second</span> edition.  (And yes, content contributions will be credited by name.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Some topics covered are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the wisdom of <strong>Napfucious</strong> and N’apseop’s Fables;</li>
<li>skill levels and responsible use of <strong>Nap-Fu</strong>;</li>
<li>various napping styles (Sport Naps, Practice Naps, Pre-Nap Warm-Up Naps, California “Extreme” Naps, etc.) (Vote now on your favorites on the <a href=""http://www.Napism.INFO"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.Napism.INFO</a> site);</li>
<li>the sham - not shame - of being (mis)diagnosed with <strong>napilepsy</strong>
</li>
<li>and – of great practical use in many everyday applications – a list of telltale behaviors that identify a fellow practicing Napist;</li>
<li>and so on!</li>
</ul>
<p><em>(You can see some SAMPLE text by visiting <a href=""http://www.napism.info"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.napism.info</a>.)</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><strong>Through this campaign</strong>, not only can you learn about fascinating aspects of Napism, <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">you can also become a part of this informative guide</span>!  If you support this project through Indiegogo, which means taking action soon, like in the next 2 minutes while operators are standing by, you can have your name – <em>or your favorite Napper’s name</em> – included in the book under the listing of the current Olympic Napping Team Members, or the National Napping Council . . . (See perks list.  <em><strong>You can specify the name to be used when you order, or leave instructions by posting a private comment right here on this page, using the tab near the top</strong>.</em>)</p>
<p><em>Just think of the harassment you could stifle with your name in the book </em>. . .Well, actually, it might instigate even more teasing, but it <em>is </em>kind of fun, isn’t it?  (Please check out the perks listed to the right - I'm betting you could start gentle mischief . . . uhm, I mean, have fun with at least one of these . . .)</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Your Participation in this Project</h3>
<p>I need your help because I am working on a particular Mystery of Life, and I have no doubt that some of you are working on this very same mystery.  I work hard, and I’m no dummy, but a lot of things just haven’t turned out quite the way I thought they would.  Then, I look around and I see <em>idiots</em> doing <em>stupid, silly</em> stuff and making <em>good</em> money!  And I’m thinking . . . well, hey, <em>I’m</em> an idiot!  And <em>I</em> do stupid stuff!  So what’s the problem?  What am I missing?  <em>That’s</em> the mystery.  Probably a lot of you out there know exactly what I'm talking about, don't you?</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Indiegogo has a campaign goal minimum of $500.  <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Of course </span>I could use more, but $500 will pay for a minimal run of 5x8 trade paperbacks at a self-publishing house.  I already have the domain names for the site, and a basic site is quite cheap, so I've got that covered.  All I want to do with this Indiegogo campaign is (a) get the book in print and (b) gauge public interest before I mount a full-on marketing campaign.</p>
<p>And if I don’t reach the $500 goal, what will I do with the money raised?  I’ll fulfill all of the claimed perks, as promised.  If it ends up costing me money, I’ll lick my wounds and cry myself into a nap (duh.)</p>
<p>In my circle there are plenty of us adults who like to take naps, and we make many jokes about it, and because of bumper stickers such as ""Naps happen"" and Twits with #nap and #naptime, I am sure there are many more of us out there.  I think this will succeed, at some level.  And when it does, I'll be able to say, ""<strong><em>Veni, vidi, dormi</em></strong>"" - <em>I came, I saw, I napped.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>So, I’m asking for your help.  You can either sign up for the project perks, or – if you’re working on that same success mystery as I am – jeez, just tell everyone you know about Napism.info here on Indiegogo.com.  Please, at least just pass the word in person and on Facebook and Twitter and yes, even strangers on the street – it’ll cost you nothing BUT it <span>will</span> earn you some good karma and sweet dreams.</p>
<p>And please add your comments - I'd love to hear from you all!</p>
<p>P.S. Please use <strong>this site's</strong> Facebook and other <strong>share tools</strong> - <span>it moves this project up in the overall listing / display!!</span></p>
<p><span>P.S.P.S. If you didn't watch the video, please do - you don't want to miss the end where my friend does a wonderful <em>Napping Blues</em> song!</span></p>

Through this campaign, not only can you learn about fascinating aspects of Napism, you can also become a part of this informative guide!  If you support this project through Indiegogo, which means taking action soon, like in the next 2 minutes while operators are standing by, you can have your name – or your favorite Napper’s name – included in the book under the listing of the current Olympic Napping Team Members, or the National Napping Council . . . (See perks list.  You can specify the name to be used when you order, or leave instructions by posting a private comment right here on this page, using the tab near the top.)
Just think of the harassment you could stifle with your name in the book . . .Well, actually, it might instigate even more teasing, but it is kind of fun, isn’t it?  (Please check out the perks listed to the right - I'm betting you could start gentle mischief . . . uhm, I mean, have fun with at least one of these . . .)
 
Your Participation in this Project
I need your help because I am working on a particular Mystery of Life, and I have no doubt that some of you are working on this very same mystery.  I work hard, and I’m no dummy, but a lot of things just haven’t turned out quite the way I thought they would.  Then, I look around and I see idiots doing stupid, silly stuff and making good money!  And I’m thinking . . . well, hey, I’m an idiot!  And I do stupid stuff!  So what’s the problem?  What am I missing?  That’s the mystery.  Probably a lot of you out there know exactly what I'm talking about, don't you?


Indiegogo has a campaign goal minimum of $500.  Of course I could use more, but $500 will pay for a minimal run of 5x8 trade paperbacks at a self-publishing house.  I already have the domain names for the site, and a basic site is quite cheap, so I've got that covered.  All I want to do with this Indiegogo campaign is (a) get the book in print and (b) gauge public interest before I mount a full-on marketing campaign.
And if I don’t reach the $500 goal, what will I do with the money raised?  I’ll fulfill all of the claimed perks, as promised.  If it ends up costing me money, I’ll lick my wounds and cry myself into a nap (duh.)
In my circle there are plenty of us adults who like to take naps, and we make many jokes about it, and because of bumper stickers such as ""Naps happen"" and Twits with #nap and #naptime, I am sure there are many more of us out there.  I think this will succeed, at some level.  And when it does, I'll be able to say, ""Veni, vidi, dormi"" - I came, I saw, I napped.
 
Any time, any where . . .

Other Ways You Can Help


So, I’m asking for your help.  You can either sign up for the project perks, or – if you’re working on that same success mystery as I am – jeez, just tell everyone you know about Napism.info here on Indiegogo.com.  Please, at least just pass the word in person and on Facebook and Twitter and yes, even strangers on the street – it’ll cost you nothing BUT it will earn you some good karma and sweet dreams.
And please add your comments - I'd love to hear from you all!
P.S. Please use this site's Facebook and other share tools - it moves this project up in the overall listing / display!!
P.S.P.S. If you didn't watch the video, please do - you don't want to miss the end where my friend does a wonderful Napping Blues song!",2.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>So Here is the Story...</h3>
<p>I discovered the ultimate recipe for cooking up unforgettable music experiences by interviewing music and community innovators. In Live LIVE! Creating Community in Music Experiences, each chapter tells the stories of innovators and reveals another ingredient to the recipe.<br/><br/>My name is Katie O'Connell and I am the author of <i>Live LIVE!</i> I wrote this book on my journey of self-exploration. Music was a big part of my identity that got pushed to the side. This is me writing music back into my personal story.<br/><br/>In this book, you will discover how you can live to the fullest in events and experiences you create or participate in. In this book, I instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for creating experiences in you. Ultimately, this book is a tool to help you design, participate in, and facilitate human-centric experiences in live music experiences and beyond.<br/><br/>You'll learn how to set physical and mental space for community events:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>How redefining and rebranding an experience creates new expectations.</strong> Anthony Diaz, CEO of Sixthman, discusses how their product started as a concert on a boat and evolved into a vacation. He explains how fans’ expectations changed and how Sixthman pivoted to enhance the customer experience.</li>

</div><p>Thank you for all of your love and support!</p><p><br/>To a purposeful adventure,<br/>Katie O'Connell</p></div>","So Here is the Story...
I discovered the ultimate recipe for cooking up unforgettable music experiences by interviewing music and community innovators. In Live LIVE! Creating Community in Music Experiences, each chapter tells the stories of innovators and reveals another ingredient to the recipe.My name is Katie O'Connell and I am the author of Live LIVE! I wrote this book on my journey of self-exploration. Music was a big part of my identity that got pushed to the side. This is me writing music back into my personal story.In this book, you will discover how you can live to the fullest in events and experiences you create or participate in. In this book, I instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for creating experiences in you. Ultimately, this book is a tool to help you design, participate in, and facilitate human-centric experiences in live music experiences and beyond.You'll learn how to set physical and mental space for community events:


How redefining and rebranding an experience creates new expectations. Anthony Diaz, CEO of Sixthman, discusses how their product started as a concert on a boat and evolved into a vacation. He explains how fans’ expectations changed and how Sixthman pivoted to enhance the customer experience.

How space for live music is defined beyond concert venues and corner bars. Sofar Sounds, Airbnb Music, and SideDoor are among the leaders that have created stages in living room, antique shops, on top of of ski slopes, and just about anywhere you could imagine. Stories from each platform offer tricks to create a sacred space to share and discover music.

How to create an exciting environment that inspires genuine human connection. There are lessons to be learned from beyond concerts, festivals, and house shows. I looked at retreats, camps, sports championship parades, cults and networking events to understand what elements create community and how these elements can be replicated in the live music experience space.

Live LIVE! speaks to experience creators and event attendees who are looking for a deep sense of purpose and belonging in new ways in live music events and beyond. The Book - Live LIVE! Creating Community in Music Experiences

<p>Περισσότερες πληροφορίες για το βιβλίο:</p>
<p>Αυτό το βιβλίο αποτελεί έναν πρακτικό οδηγό για ένα δημιουργικό ταξίδι πειραματισμού στον κόσμο του χειροποίητου φυσικού σαπουνιού με ένα οικολογικό και βιώσιμο τρόπο. Παρουσιάζει τις 80 πιο επιτυχημένες συνταγές του εργαστηρίου Νatural Collection και των σεμιναρίων παρασκευής σαπουνιού της Νέας Γουινέας, ενώ ταυτόχρονα παρέχει όλες τις απαραίτητες πληροφορίες για να μπορέσετε να δημιουργήσετε καινούριες συνταγές που να ανταποκρίνονται στις προσωπικές σας ανάγκες.</p>

Ακόμη, θα μελετήσουμε τις ιδιότητες των φυσικών πρώτων υλών που χρησιμοποιούνται στη σαπωνοποίηση (έλαια, βούτυρα, βότανα, αιθέρια έλαια, άργιλοι κ.α.) και τις ιδιότητες που προσδίδουν στο σαπούνι που προκύπτει. Τέλος θα διερευνήσουμε φυσικά υλικά που δίνουν χρώμα, υφή και μυρωδιά στο σαπούνι και θα περιγράψουμε διαφορετικές τεχνικές που κάνουν ακόμα πιο ενδιαφέρον το αισθητικό αποτέλεσμα.</p>

<h3>Welcome!!!</h3>
<p>Remember the swinging 60’s and 70’s? Key parties and free love? While those innocent times are long gone there are still plenty of people in today’s society looking for advice on opening up their relationship, in different ways than Mum and Dad.<br/><br/><em>Not Your Mother’s Playground: A realistic guide to honest, happy and healthy open relationships</em> (NYMP) is a book on modern open relationships aimed at a new generation, discussing everything from swinging to polyamory (multiple loves). It includes personal triumphs and challenges mixed in to give it a relatable, intimate feel. When my husband Steph and I looked to the stores to find material on the topic, the majority of the books we found were directed to an older, more “free-love” focused crowd.<br/><br/>Polyamory and other open relationship structures have often been written about from this perspective, making everything appear quite simple and easy - or as I say ""Flowers and Bunnies"". My plan with NYMP is to talk about open relationships from a realistic and experienced viewpoint, giving people honest advice and examples from not only my own life but others' as well.<br/><br/>The idea behind Not Your Mother’s Playground is to walk the reader through everything they will encounter should they choose to open up their relationship. It will show all sides from the good to the bad, not ignoring the reality that these relationships come with complications that can put even the strongest couples to the test.<br/><br/>NYMP is written from a first person point of view as I offer advice and guidance in a light-hearted, relatable and easy to understand tone. It’s important to me that readers feel as if they are engaged in a conversation while reading instead of having to understand self-help jargon. In addition to my advice and personal anecdotes, I will also include stories from other non-monogamous people and experts.<br/><br/>NYMP presents the steps readers need to take to succeed in their own open relationship in a way that’s not overwhelming for even relationship traditionalists to read.<br/><br/>Using inspiration from other well-known polyamory / swinging works such as “The Ethical Slut”, ""<span id=""btAsinTitle"">Opening Up: A Guide to Creating and Sustaining Open Relationships"" </span>and “Polyamory – the New Love Without Limits”, NYMP hopes to reach a new generation of people looking for guidance.</p>

<h3>More Information is Fun (Here is some!)</h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.NotYourMothersPlayground.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.NotYourMothersPlayground.com</a> is the accompanying website to the book and<br/>has a strong group of followers that is constantly growing since its creation in March of 2008. I use the blog to share experiences from my own relationship. I receive emails from people constantly, either through the website or Twitter where I have close to 3000 followers, all expressing their thanks to me for writing about nonâ€monogamy in a way that presents it as normal, nonâ€fringe way of life.</p>
<p>In addition to writing about open relationships on my website, I have also been in a<br/>successful open marriage since 2006 and firmly believe in that old adage of “writing what you know”.</p>
<p>Here is some feedback that I have received regarding the book from blog readers:</p>
<p><em>“This book is important now more than ever. Polyamory and other nonâ€traditional</em><br/><em>relationships are gaining momentum. As our culture changes and evolves, some of the social barriers that restricted us are breaking down. People are freer to explore love for the sake of love, and the face of what that love looks like is similarly evolving. I look forward to reading Samantha’s book!”</em></p>
<p><em>‘Finally, a CANADIAN book that deals with the reality of open marriages and polyamory. Perhaps the time is finally coming when having an “open marriage” can be discussed early and openly as an option to monogamy. This is healthy, this is overdue, and this will be on my bookshelf and into my teenager’s hands.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Although I’ve been following you for only a few months, your willingness to share the</em> <em>minute details of your life through both your blog and tweet stream have led me to see you and @stephgoulet as something of a polyamorous role model couple. Your example has been immensely helpful in easing hesitations through my personal transition to open marriage. I look forward to seeing your book on the shelves, and the opportunity to learn more from your experiences.”</em></p>
<p><em>“I can’t wait to read your book. I find it very interesting that people involved in open</em><br/><em>marriages are able to make it work. I would love to know what types if issues there are and how different people deal with them. I believe your book will be enlightening to me.”</em></p>

My name is Victor Villaseñor.  I believe my next book can change our world.  It’s called Revenge of a Catholic Schoolboy and it’s a story that bridges cultures and religions.  My previous books have also done much of the same.  Read on and join forces with me and be part of this global quest!

WHO AM I?

My name is Victor Villaseñor and I am a writer from Oceanside, California.  I had 265 rejections before I sold my first book.  Now my books are being used in high schools, libraries and universities across much of the U.S. In fact, my best selling book - Rain of Gold is on the recommended reading list for the California State Board of Education.  The New York Public Library has placed my book Burro Genius, on their list of Top Books for the Teen Age, 2005.But it was not always like this.  Let me explain...
1960, Wyoming
I was 20 years old.  I was lost and angry and ashamed that I didn’t know how to read. Unbeknownst to me, I’m dyslexic.  And yet, up in the wilds of Wyoming, I decided to do the bravest thing I have ever done - become a writer. Afire, I came home from Wyoming to Southern California and went to see my old high school English teacher, telling him my big decision.  At first, he gave me a strange look.  I’d never done anything higher than D and F work in his class. But he didn’t laugh at me.  Instead, he walked me across his classroom, and pointed to a poster on the wall that said:“Whatever you can do or dream you can do, begin it. Boldness has genius, power, and magic.”Then he turned to me. 
“You’ll do it.  I can see it in your eyes.”
With my teacher’s words engraved in my heart, I started learning how to read with 4th grade books.  I wrote for ten years and received 265 rejections before I sold my first book, Macho!, which was immediately compared to the best of John Steinbeck by the L.A. Times. Since then I have had 5 bestsellers and been nominated for the Pulitzer Prize 3 times.“(Rain of Gold)…is one of the best…books of this year or any year.” - USA Today“…by looking back, a gifted storyteller finds words to remind us of something lost on the journey forward.”  - The Washington Post“Villasenor is a born storyteller…” - Publisher’s WeeklyAnd now, Revenge of a Catholic Schoolboy is a must book.
 
ABOUT MY BOOK
I want to bring a message of hope, meaning and personal transformation through my next book, Revenge of A Catholic Schoolboy to as many people as possible.It is a wild, pertinent story that bridges cultural and religious differences.Here’s the back story:Religiously the whole world is in a transformation. Stories of hate and violence are spread virally across the internet, on mobile phones, email.  Worldwide, over 100 million people have left the Roman Catholic Church (or others) missing in the rituals and ceremonies of a church.  People are losing faith, not just in God, but in themselves and each other.My next book - which hopefully, you will help fund - sees this.  
Revenge of A Catholic Schoolboy starts with the story of how I was invited to meet at a group home of retired nuns and priests. At first, I didn’t want to go because of the terrible abuses I’d suffered as a boy at the hands of nuns and priests.  But I asked for guidance, slept on it, and in the morning I awoke and went with an open heart...
By the end of my talk - and to my shock - some of the nuns had tears in their eyes and one curly-haired old nun leaped out of her chair and shouted, “I feel free for the first time in my life to love God without fear.”
A young priest, who’d had a nervous breakdown and was staying at this retirement home, said that they had to go and tell the Pope, because the Indigenous Spiritual Information I’d brought to them could revolutionize the whole Catholic Church and help resolve conflicts between the different religions of the world. I was astonished. Never in my wildest dreams had I ever thought that coming forward with the Native American Knowledge I’d been raised with could open a door for these nuns and priests long enough for them to see infinite possibilities beyond their cultural and religious beliefs. 
This is what your pledge to this campaign can do - open the door for mutual understanding through the written word.


WHY PEERFUNDING?

I now find myself hard-pressed to finish the book I am currently working on, titled Revenge of a Catholic Schoolboy.Publishers no longer give advances to writers like me, who aren’t huge national bestsellers, so we can write our next book. 85% of all books used to be sold by small local bookstores. I’d do book signings at these places and this was my bread and butter, getting to know people first hand, but now that’s all gone. I want to publish my next book and - using the power of the internet - connect with my many, many fans and readers (that’s you!).So, I need your help big time!

I am asking for funds in the amount of $70,000 to help write, edit, publish and market my next book.

I’m prepared to do all I can possibly do so Revenge of a Catholic Schoolboy reaches as many people as possible and as soon as possible. Here’s what your money will go towards...


Writing: writing, writing and more writing.  This is what I do!  Did I mention writing?


Research & Legal: all of my books are meticulously researched through interviews and meetings and then lawyers need to review to see that I’m not infringing on individual privacy.  Remember, these are TRUE stories about REAL people.


Editing: not just me, but teams of editors that work to sand down the rough edges of my words to the smooth stones of truth and story you read.


Audio books: recording and producing audio books with a professional actor and/or actress.


Marketing: this is exciting!  For this book, we are going to be doing much of the marketing ourselves - newspapers, magazines, PDFs, friends’ emails, enewsletters, my website, Facebook and this ‘social media’ stuff.  This stuff is all new to me, but I am incredibly lucky in that I have my family and friends helping with this.


Mailing review copies: Contacting, shipping, handling, packaging.  


Online fundraising manager: we’re very lucky to have Morgan Sully as our Web Manager leading the team and doing everything from mercilessly copy-editing my words and voice for the web (sometimes with me yelling at him!), to trouble shooting our tech needs during the campaign.  Do yourself a BIG favor and go hire him for your next project - when we are done with him of course!


A book tour: Yes, you read that right.  A BOOK TOUR.  As I said, I am prepared to do ALL I can to ensure Revenge gets to as many people as possible as quickly as possible.  While this is the bread and butter for my soul, from my years of experience doing this, these things cost MONEY.  Researching the best cities to visit, contacting local media, schools, bookstores, and then finding food, accommodations, venues, flights, PR and a personal assistant (most likely my friend Gary Gernandt or my sister Linda).  Mind you, I just don’t come in for the day and speak to one group of people and leave, but I actually stay in town for several days so that it can become a local event.   This is good stuff, people!  Contact us and invite us to your place.

<h3>What I do</h3>
<p>I write stories for kids and love telling absurd stories that make people smile. I picked up this hobby about a year ago and have been learning and growing ever since. You can check out some of my latest works at <a href=""http://www.robtowner.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.robtowner.com</a> ALL FREE! This is my website, here you will find:</p>
<ul>
<li>Audio Books</li>
<li>Flash Flip-Books</li>
<li>Hand-written and illustrated PDF's</li>
<li>And just plain silly stories</li>
</ul>
<p>I have recently written a full feature length novel for children and adults to enjoy and am hoping to raise a marketing budget to generate awareness of the book.</p>
<p>The book is titled 'Animal Friends', and tracks a Christmas Beetle and a Cicada travelling the globe, discovering superpowers they didn't know they had (such as teleportation, mid control etc.) and making friends along the way to defeat the oncoming threat of evil orange cubes.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>In short, I am hoping to raise $5,000 to market this book online:</p>
<p>All funds raised here will go towards a 5 month long Google Adwords campaign targeting specific keywords needed to reach my desired audience... Kids aged 12 and up.</p>
<div>After extensive research into online book purchasing habits, I believe this will be the best and most cost effective avenue for me to explore.</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Every single penny that I earn from the sale of this book will be donated to the Westmead Children's Hospital in Sydney Australia. <a href=""http://www.chw.edu.au/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.chw.edu.au/</a></p>
<p>This means that $5000 in donations here could potentially mean a lot more than that to the hospital.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why Am I Doing This?</h3>
<p>I started writing children's stories because I loved seeing kids smile after they read one of my adventures.</p>
<p>My aim here is to not only make kids smile, but help out the ones that are going through a rough time dealing with burns, cancer and other life threatening diseases.</p>
<p><strong>Accountability:</strong> You will be able to track all my progress at facebook.com/FREEstory. Here, I will make available all my Google Adwords expenditure/recepits to ensure I do what I actually say I'm going to do.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My name is Derek Webster.  As a strategic consultant and speaker, I've had the opportunity to meet with thousands of people trying to make a difference in the world.  The biggest hurdle many have is intrinsic:  bridging the gap between ""want to"" and ""am doing"".  <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This book is written in the same approach as Malcom Gladwell and provides a framework for both bridging that divide, as well as, for connecting with others.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Over the years, as people have implemented some of the principles suggested and outlined in the book, they've gained traction.  Longing finally caught up with living!  We've seen hip-hop companies and churches started, social ministries, churches, and executives who have all found a meaningful filter by which to impact their divisions.  Most books provide a methodology which may not be applied to every setting.  Others provide great theology, leaving the reader wondering what to do next.  This book bridges that divide.</p>
<p>Recently, a literary agent stated that the writing was very strong, but the platform wasn't broad enough.  In today's market, the author essentially markets themselves.  The author has to have an audience in order to provide something to that audience.  Right now, my base audience is about 500 people.  I am hoping to provide something of real value and help to them in order that they can feel confident to reach out to friends.  <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

My name is Derek Webster.  As a strategic consultant and speaker, I've had the opportunity to meet with thousands of people trying to make a difference in the world.  The biggest hurdle many have is intrinsic:  bridging the gap between ""want to"" and ""am doing"".  

This book is written in the same approach as Malcom Gladwell and provides a framework for both bridging that divide, as well as, for connecting with others.  


The Impact
Over the years, as people have implemented some of the principles suggested and outlined in the book, they've gained traction.  Longing finally caught up with living!  We've seen hip-hop companies and churches started, social ministries, churches, and executives who have all found a meaningful filter by which to impact their divisions.  Most books provide a methodology which may not be applied to every setting.  Others provide great theology, leaving the reader wondering what to do next.  This book bridges that divide.
Recently, a literary agent stated that the writing was very strong, but the platform wasn't broad enough.  In today's market, the author essentially markets themselves.  The author has to have an audience in order to provide something to that audience.  Right now, my base audience is about 500 people.  I am hoping to provide something of real value and help to them in order that they can feel confident to reach out to friends.  


What We Need & What You Get
If you pre-pay the amount of the book, then you'll also receive some free music and small group resources.  After you donate, simply send me an email at derek_webster@mac.com stating you donated.  When the book is published, I'll make sure you get the bonus material.

<h3>Why Does This Exist?</h3>
<p>Hello there! If you are reading this, congratulations! You have stumbled upon a project of grave importance for all citizens of the world.</p>
<p>Not really.</p>
<p>My name is Kelsey Miller. I am a business student in New England majoring in Corporate Finance and Accounting with a minor in Creative Writing. Yeah, that's a pretty weird combination, I know, but it led me to being accepted as one of about 150 interns at the Cannes Film Festival!</p>
<p>You could say that I'm excited.</p>
<p>I created this campaign in order to pay off the last expenses of the internship (like airfare), but the purpose of this project is to fund a book I'll write about my time in Cannes. I published a book back in 2011, so if you're thinking that this might be some teenager's travel diary, have no fear! It will be an insightful and entertaining look into life at the festival.</p>
<p>And to be completely honest, if my book can motivate students to pursue careers in the film industry (even if they're business students, like me) or even to cultivate a love of traveling, that would be AWESOME. I think that would be the most rewarding thing for me.</p>
<p>If that sounds pretty cool (and believe me, it is) then take a look at these nifty perks I have in conjunction with the project.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need </h3>
<p>Okay, so like <em>literally everything</em> these days, this internship is pretty expensive. I've already covered some of the costs, like the $3500 program fee, but I'll need a little help covering the rest. </p>
<p>Here is what my campaign funds will cover: </p>
<p><strong>Publishing the Book</strong>: Of course, there will be costs associated with publishing the book. Luckily, with Amazon's publishing services, Createspace and Kindle Direct Publishing, these costs are minimal. They should be around <strong>$25</strong>. I'm not kidding. </p>
<p><strong>Airfare</strong>: I have to actually <em>get </em>to Cannes, yeah? Luckily, I should be able to use frequent flyer miles to get to Paris, but then I'll need a second flight all the way down to Nice, which is a town (or <em>ville</em>, as they say in France) over from Cannes. This round-trip flight should cost around <strong>$400</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Gown</strong>: I know what you're all thinking; this is just an excuse to go shopping. Nope. Not at all. I'm actually not a shopaholic (I get tired--walking around malls all day is <em>exhausting</em>). However, there is a strict dress code at Cannes, and they'll actually kick you out of an event if you're not dressed correctly! That would be pretty humiliating, for both myself and my employer, so I want to make sure I have a nice gown to wear to these events. I think <strong>$500</strong> should buy a decent gown, which is actually a low amount for a formal outfit.</p>
<p><strong>Food</strong>: I have to survive, you know. I'd like about 50 Euros a day to spend on food, since I'll have to take care of two meals per day. So, for ten days of food that will be <strong>$650</strong>, because of the exchange rate. I'm pretty excited, because Cannes has all of these markets where you can buy fresh food. I'll also be able to <em>parler en Français</em>!</p>
<p><strong>Business Cards</strong>: This is a job, after all. I'll need to have a way for people, like my employer, to contact me. I've already set up some cards on Moo.com, which total <strong>$100</strong>. That's for 200 business cards.</p>
<p>This <strong>totals</strong> to <strong>$1,675</strong>. Of course, I'd also like to some additional funds, like spending money to buy something for my mom, a newer camera to update the blogs with SUPER AWESOME photos, and a second gown, so that people don't begin to suspect I smell. </p>
<p>However, going over my goal can only result in GOOD THINGS for the people funding my campaign, like extra perks and SURPRISES.</p>
<p>Hint, hint.</p>
<p>Also: My campaign is <strong>flexible</strong><strong>, </strong>which means that whatever money is raised I'll keep, regardless of whether I raise the amount listed. If, by some unbelievably unfortunate circumstance I cannot raise all of the funds, I'll put the money toward these areas in order, starting with the publishing costs and ending with business cards.</p>
<p>ONE MORE THING: You'll notice that I'm not asking for $1,675. That is because Indiegogo will take out 4% of the money as a commission (it's 9% if it is not fully funded) and 3% for credit card processing. On top of this, I may have to pay taxes on the funds received (it's hard to know for sure, since current legislature was written before the era of crowdfunding, but I'm assuming I'll have to pay taxes). Federal, state, and local taxes come to 19% of my income.</p>
<p>So, I can expect 26% of the funds I raise to be taken out before I see even a penny. Therefore, I need to take this into consideration when setting a goal for my campaign. </p>
<p>This new amount comes to <strong>$2,264</strong>, which is what you'll see in the Funding Goal.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>And now for what you're all really interested in--the perks. Just like in the festival, there is a hierarchy to these perks, starting out with the lowly intern and ending with the godlike producer. Best of all, <strong>these perks are cumulative</strong>, so if you sign up for one a few links up the chain, you'll get all the perks below it!</p>
<p>Excited yet? </p>
<p>Here is a better explanation of each perk, including <strong>an explanation of the prices:</strong><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong><em>THE INTERN</em></p>
<p>People who contribute <strong>$10</strong> will receive access to a blog updated in real-time with pictures, excerpts from the book, videos, and more. I know what you're thinking; I can just find it on the internet! Not so. This blog will be SUPER SECRET, which means you can only access it if you have a password. You'll also get a shout-out in the acknowledgements.</p>
<p>Why the price?</p>
<p>About 31% will be taken out for Indiegogo's processing fees and my taxes (this is higher than the 26%, in case the total is not raised and I have to pay a higher fee to Indiegogo), so $3.10 will be removed from the contribution before I even see it!</p>
<p>Approximate total cost of this perk: $3.10</p>
<p>So, <strong>$6.90</strong> is actually contributed toward my campaign (the $1,675 I actually need) with each INTERN, and if <strong>227</strong><strong> people</strong> contributed with this perk, my campaign will be fully funded, since the amount that is immediately taken out drops from 31% to 26% once the campaign reaches the goal (more is contributed to the $1,675 with each perk when this happens).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>THE ACTOR</em></p>
<p>If you contribute <strong>$25</strong>, you will receive a digital copy of the book, which will come in two formats: PDF and Kindle. You will also receive the INTERN perk. </p>
<p>Why the price?</p>
<p>Again, 31% will be taken out right away, which is $7.75. Also, if you select a Kindle copy, it will cost $1 to send it with the correct formatting.  </p>
<p>Approximate total cost of this perk: $8.75</p>
<p>So, <strong>$16.25</strong> is actually contributed toward my campaign with each ACTOR, and if <strong>91</strong><strong> people</strong> contributed with this perk, my campaign will be fully funded.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>THE FILMMAKER</em></p>
<p>If you contribute <strong>$50</strong>, you will receive a signed copy of the book, as well as a personalized thank-you note. You will also receive the INTERN and ACTOR perks. If the contributor is shipping internationally (outside the U.S.) it will be an additional $15.</p>
<p>Why the price?</p>
<p>Again, 31% is taken out, which amounts to $15.50. There will be an additional $1 in cost if you select a Kindle Copy. It will cost $5.80 to ship the book and thank-you note to the contributor within the U.S., based on the flat rate of Media Mail with the USPS.</p>
<p>It will also cost at least another $5 to buy the book (Amazon has to make money, too) and some other amount to ship it to me so that I can sign it. That amount is harder to estimate, since I will buy the total number of books needed at once, and that will spread the shipping costs over the books ordered. Let's say that amount is $1. I'll also need to buy a bunch of thank-you notes, so that will probably be $.50 a card.</p>
<p>Approximate total cost of this perk: $28.80</p>
<p>So, <strong>$21.20</strong> is contributed toward my campaign with each FILMMAKER, and if <strong>46</strong><strong> people</strong> contribute with this perk, my campaign will be fully funded.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>THE SELLER</em></p>
<p>If you contribute <strong>$100</strong>, you will receive a postcard from Cannes, as well as exclusive photos not found on the blog. You will also receive the INTERN, ACTOR, and FILMMAKER perks. If the contributor is shipping internationally (outside the U.S.) it will be an additional $15.</p>
<p>Why the price?</p>
<ul>
<li>31% is immediately taken out for Indiegogo (again, assuming the goal is not reached, so that I'm not surprised by additional costs) and for taxes, which is $31.</li>
<li>$1 if the contributor selects a Kindle Copy</li>
<li>$5.80 to ship the book, thank-you note, and photos</li>
<li>$6 to buy and ship the book to me to sign for the contributor</li>
<li>$.50 for the thank-you note</li>
<li>$1.15 to send the postcard from Cannes</li>
<li>$1.30 to buy the postcard in Cannes</li>
<li>$1.90 to buy printed copies of the photos</li>
</ul>
<p>Approximate total cost of this perk: $48.65</p>
<p>So, <strong>$51.35 </strong>is contributed toward my campaign with each SELLER, and if <strong>23 people</strong> contribute with this perk, my campaign will be fully funded.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>THE DISTRIBUTOR</em></p>
<p>If you contribute <strong>$250</strong>, you will receive a mystery gift from the festival, which could be anything from souvenirs to a movie star's used coffee cup (probably not that one; that would be creepy). You will also receive the INTERN, ACTOR, FILMMAKER, and SELLER perks. If the contributor is shipping internationally (outside the U.S.) it will be an additional $15.</p>
<p>Why the price?</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>31% is immediately taken out for Indiegogo (again, assuming the goal is not reached) and for taxes, which is $77.50.</li>
<li>$1 if the contributor selects a Kindle Copy</li>
<li>$5.80 to ship the book, thank-you note, and photos</li>
<li>$6 to buy and ship the book to me to sign for the contributor</li>
<li>$.50 for the thank-you note</li>
<li>$1.15 to send the postcard from Cannes</li>
<li>$1.30 to buy the postcard in Cannes</li>
<li>$1.90 to buy printed copies of the photos</li>
<li>And this mystery gift. The problem with estimating this cost is that I really have no idea how much this will cost--I don't know what the gift will be, although I DO know it will be awesome. It will have to be fairly small though, since I have to transport all of them back with me. I expect it will be $13-$39.</li>
<li>Another $5.80 to ship the mystery gift domestically, if it does not fit with the book, note, and photos</li>
</ul>
<p>Approximate total cost of this perk: $139.95</p>
<p>So, <strong>$110</strong> is actually contributed toward my campaign with each DISTRIBUTOR, and if <strong>9 people</strong> contribute with this award, my campaign will be fully funded.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>THE PRODUCER</em></p>
<p>If you contribute <strong>$800</strong>, I will Skype (or use Google hangout) you during the festival! You will be able to see firsthand what the festival is like. Of course, I don't know the details yet, like when during the day I'll be free or where there will be Internet access, but it should be pretty fun! Plus, you will receive EVERY other award listed above. If the contributor is shipping internationally (outside the U.S.) it will be an additional $15.</p>
<p>Why the price?</p>
<ul>
<li>31% is immediately taken out, which totals $248</li>
<li>$1 if the contributor selects a Kindle Copy</li>
<li>$5.80 to ship the book, thank-you note, and photos</li>
<li>$6 to buy and ship the book to me to sign for the contributor</li>
<li>$.50 for the thank-you note</li>
<li>$1.15 to send the postcard from Cannes</li>
<li>$1.30 to buy the postcard in Cannes</li>
<li>$1.90 to buy printed copies of the photos</li>
<li>And this mystery gift. The problem with estimating this cost is that I really have no idea how much this will cost--I don't know what the gift will be, although I DO know it will be awesome. It will have to be fairly small though, since I have to transport all of them back with me. I expect it will be $13-$39.</li>
<li>Another $5.80 to ship the mystery gift domestically, if it does not fit with the book, note, and photos</li>
</ul>
<p>Approximate total cost of this perk: $310.45</p>
<p>So, <strong>$489.55</strong> is contributed toward my campaign with each PRODUCER, and if <strong>3 people</strong> contribute with this award, my campaign will be fully funded.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>My intention with this project is to create a book that will serve as an inside look into the Cannes Film Festival and life on the French Riviera. I hope that future students interning at Cannes will be able to read my book and know what they can expect when they work for those two weeks in May. </p>
<p>Also, I would be so happy if reading my book stirred more people to travel. I believe traveling and interacting with people of different backgrounds is an essential part of life.  I think many problems arise out of simple misunderstandings. </p>
<p>Plus, I want to make sure that I remember as much as possible about this internship. And you know what? I actually love writing, so I probably would have done this even without the Indiegogo.</p>
<p>And I'm pretty sure my parents will want to know what sort of shennanigans I had at Cannes (although maybe not all of them).</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you're still reading this (and if you are, my hat's off to you, because this is LONG), and are unsure or unable to contribute to my campaign, I understand. Not everyone can contribute.</p>
<p>But I would SUPER appreciate it if you took a moment or two to share this campaign with your friends, family, or anyone else you think might be interested. If your efforts got even one person to contribute, that would be great!</p>
<p>There are also a few ways you can share this campaign through Indiegogo, which can be found under the video.</p>
<p><strong>Thanks for reading this and contributing! I hope to send you a book of my time in Cannes very soon! </strong></p>

Hello there! If you are reading this, congratulations! You have stumbled upon a project of grave importance for all citizens of the world.
Not really.
My name is Kelsey Miller. I am a business student in New England majoring in Corporate Finance and Accounting with a minor in Creative Writing. Yeah, that's a pretty weird combination, I know, but it led me to being accepted as one of about 150 interns at the Cannes Film Festival!

Plus, I want to make sure that I remember as much as possible about this internship. And you know what? I actually love writing, so I probably would have done this even without the Indiegogo.
And I'm pretty sure my parents will want to know what sort of shennanigans I had at Cannes (although maybe not all of them).
 


Other Ways You Can Help
If you're still reading this (and if you are, my hat's off to you, because this is LONG), and are unsure or unable to contribute to my campaign, I understand. Not everyone can contribute.
But I would SUPER appreciate it if you took a moment or two to share this campaign with your friends, family, or anyone else you think might be interested. If your efforts got even one person to contribute, that would be great!
There are also a few ways you can share this campaign through Indiegogo, which can be found under the video.
Thanks for reading this and contributing! I hope to send you a book of my time in Cannes very soon!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Synopsis
‘Love at first Click - Lucy's Story’ is an inspiring story about a woman in her mid-thirties whose world comes to a standstill after her fiancé leaves her just days before their wedding. We have all had our hearts broken, but hers gets spectacularly shattered. Being single after many comfortable years in a relationship is a scary prospect, especially for someone who truly believes her best and most beautiful years are long behind her. Convinced she will never find love again, let alone have a family, she sets out to reclaim her life and passion against all odds and unexpectedly meets Mr Perfect.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Become a part of the first Liberty's book</h3>
<p align=""justify"">The purpose of <a href=""http://www.readliberty.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ReadLiberty.org</a> is to transcribe, preserve and spread all 403 issues of Liberty, Not the Daughter But the Mother of Order, an individualist anarchist periodical originally edited and published by Benjamin Tucker from 1881 to 1908.</p>
<p align=""justify"">As part of our activities we have decided to publish the whole Volume I of Liberty in the form of an eBook in ePub, Mobi and PDF formats. In the phase one an eBook containing issues 1-13 of the original Volume I will be made available. Once they are all transcribed, the eBook will be updated to contain all 26 issues of the original Volume I. And you can be a part of the book!</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">When can you expect the book?</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/45708/files/20130901013010-timeline2.png?1378024210"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What do we need the funds for?</h3>
<p align=""justify"">Although everything published by ReadLiberty.org is free to use in the true sense of the word and we're transcribing, preserving and spreading the Liberty in our free time for our entertainment, we still need to pay our external partners for their services.</p>
<p align=""justify"">It's estimated we'll need about $500 for a decent typographic cover image and other graphic work, the typesetting, to pay the Indiegogo platform fees and to have a little reserve left just in case.</p>
<p align=""justify"">You can help us make it all happen by becoming a part of the book and sharing the campaign with your friends and followers.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Why would we like to publish this book?</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">An eBook published in all of the most common formats (ePub, Mobi, PDF) is a perfect way to spread the already transcribed and hopefully preserved issues of Liberty.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Why do we want you to be a part of the book?</h3>
<p align=""justify"">We're transcribing Liberty not only for our own entertainment but for yours as well.</p>
<p align=""justify"">We really love Liberty and although we can't agree with every view of its original authors we still enjoy transcribing and reading every single article. And is there something better than being a part of something you love?</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Would you like to be a Liberty book's Associate Producer?</h3>
<p align=""justify"">Then share the campaign with your friends and followers! Up to two of you, who will bring either the highest number of contributors or the highest amount of contributions to the campaign will be offered an Associate Producer credit. Just Log In and start sharing by using the Share Bar tools under the introductory video.</p>

<p align=""justify""><b>Q:</b> Is my contribution tax deductible?<br/><b>A:</b> Unfortunately for all of us it most probably isn't. On the other side, as a gift it is not subject to tax on our side either.</p>
<p align=""justify""><b>Q:</b> What license will be the book subject to?
<br/><b>A:</b> Liberty itself is in the public domain. As we don't believe in the concept of IP the book will be a subject to the <a href=""http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CC0</a> ""license"". Although you don't have to we'll be thankful if you choose to mark us as the authors of the transcription and let others to use the work in the same way. Happy reading, sharing, editing and selling!</p>
<p align=""justify""><b>Q:</b> Does it mean that I can print and sell the book?
<br/><b>A:</b> Yes, you can! We'd definitely buy the book in a printed form. Just make it clear that we're not printing and selling it. Also if you are selling the book for profit consider sharing part of that profit with John Zube, founder of the Libertarian Microfiche Publishing, Shawn P. Wilbur, author of the PDF version of the Liberty, or <a href=""http://www.readliberty.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ReadLiberty.org</a>, authors of the transcriptions and the book.</p>
<p align=""justify""><b>Q:</b> Is it possible to contribute in Bitcoins, Litecoins or Feathercoins?

Reed. http://www.readliberty.org/books/instead-of-a-book-by-men-too-modest-to-write-one.
Download the books to your eBook reader, print them or do whatever else you want with them. Happy reading, sharing, editing and selling!
Stretch goal Nº1 - Proofreading
Thanks to one of our readers, who have found a hard to miss mistranscription at the beginning of the first issue of Liberty, we have come up with an idea for a new perk - Proofreader.
Along the Supporters page there will be a Proofreaders page at the end of the book containing names and scores of the people who have found and/or fixed a mistranscription in Liberty at ReadLiberty.org.
To claim the perk you can write a comment here in the Comments tab, contact the people at ReadLiberty.org or correct the mistake directly in the GitHub repository.
Would you help us spread the word?
     

     

     

     



Become a part of the first Liberty's book
The purpose of ReadLiberty.org is to transcribe, preserve and spread all 403 issues of Liberty, Not the Daughter But the Mother of Order, an individualist anarchist periodical originally edited and published by Benjamin Tucker from 1881 to 1908.
As part of our activities we have decided to publish the whole Volume I of Liberty in the form of an eBook in ePub, Mobi and PDF formats. In the phase one an eBook containing issues 1-13 of the original Volume I will be made available. Once they are all transcribed, the eBook will be updated to contain all 26 issues of the original Volume I. And you can be a part of the book!
When can you expect the book?

What do we need the funds for?
Although everything published by ReadLiberty.org is free to use in the true sense of the word and we're transcribing, preserving and spreading the Liberty in our free time for our entertainment, we still need to pay our external partners for their services.
It's estimated we'll need about $500 for a decent typographic cover image and other graphic work, the typesetting, to pay the Indiegogo platform fees and to have a little reserve left just in case.
You can help us make it all happen by becoming a part of the book and sharing the campaign with your friends and followers.
Why would we like to publish this book?
An eBook published in all of the most common formats (ePub, Mobi, PDF) is a perfect way to spread the already transcribed and hopefully preserved issues of Liberty.
Why do we want you to be a part of the book?
We're transcribing Liberty not only for our own entertainment but for yours as well.
We really love Liberty and although we can't agree with every view of its original authors we still enjoy transcribing and reading every single article. And is there something better than being a part of something you love?
Would you like to be a Liberty book's Associate Producer?
Then share the campaign with your friends and followers! Up to two of you, who will bring either the highest number of contributors or the highest amount of contributions to the campaign will be offered an Associate Producer credit. Just Log In and start sharing by using the Share Bar tools under the introductory video.
You can of course become an Associate Producer of the book right away by claiming the Associate Producer perk.
Questions and Answers
Q: Is this an official ReadLiberty.org crowdfunding campaign?A: Yes, it is. You can check the announcement at ReadLiberty.org/indiegogo-campaign
Q: What would you do with the funds risen over the goal?A: The funds would be used for further expansion of our activities.
Q: Is my contribution tax deductible?A: Unfortunately for all of us it most probably isn't. On the other side, as a gift it is not subject to tax on our side either.
Q: What license will be the book subject to?
A: Liberty itself is in the public domain. As we don't believe in the concept of IP the book will be a subject to the CC0 ""license"". Although you don't have to we'll be thankful if you choose to mark us as the authors of the transcription and let others to use the work in the same way. Happy reading, sharing, editing and selling!
Q: Does it mean that I can print and sell the book?
A: Yes, you can! We'd definitely buy the book in a printed form. Just make it clear that we're not printing and selling it. Also if you are selling the book for profit consider sharing part of that profit with John Zube, founder of the Libertarian Microfiche Publishing, Shawn P. Wilbur, author of the PDF version of the Liberty, or ReadLiberty.org, authors of the transcriptions and the book.
Q: Is it possible to contribute in Bitcoins, Litecoins or Feathercoins?
A: Yes, but not directly. Any BTC, LTC and FTC donated to us during the campaign will be converted to FRNs and transferred to the campaign.
Q: Who will be the typographic artist?A: It will be Juan Osborne and we'd like you to be a part of his new typographic portrait.

Typographic portrait of Dennis Ritchie by Juan Osborne.

<h3>The Book </h3>
<p>So I started thinking, what’s interesting about my life? What could I write about? I haven't done anything. The only thing I’ve done most of my adult life is go to college, stay unemployed, run, drink and hook up with girls. I haven’t really grown up like my other friends have. My other friends have jobs, homes, wives, kids. I’ve been watching everyone get married and start their lives. I was the best man in a friend’s wedding and I’ll be the best man in two other friend's weddings. As I was thinking about this, it hit me. This is my book! I’ll write a book about post-college life. A book about drinking, hooking up with girls, and being the best man in three weddings. A book about love, marriage, divorce and growing up. <br/></p>

<h3><u><strong>Story of My Book</strong></u></h3>
<p><i>One Decision Away </i>creates exposure to varying levels of trauma, an inevitability within our lives. Our abilities to cope with that trauma (or lack thereof) creates a pathway of choices, pathways in which we are always one decision away from embracing the unforeseen lesson through a conduit of grace or through a conduit of manifested hatred. Single reactive decisions compel the power to alter the course of our lives. How you perceive the world before your eyes will construct EVERYTHING in your life. <br/><br/>My name is (April) Emiry Callum and I am the author of <i>One Decision Away</i>. I wrote this book to delve into the worlds and minds of trauma-based scenarios, many of which may resonate deeply with contemporary social problems, and while it exposes the intricacies of depression, the recurring theme of unwavering hope forged with mental fortitude, aimed at healing a shattered spirit is remarkably present. Hope is never lost even when the world seemingly conspires against you. <br/><br/>It is my sincere hope that if you have experienced any amount of trauma within your life, my book will inspire recognition that you are not alone in this world. There is purposeful solidarity and cohesion to be found in your experience. <br/><br/>In this book, you'll encounter multifaceted dimensions of personal stories through narratives of different dynamics of trauma such as:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Family Trauma</li>
<li>Family Legacy</li>
<li>Mental Health Awareness / Suicide Prevention</li>
<li>Relationships and Heartache </li>
<li>Personal Adversity</li>
<li>Military Achievements </li>
<li>Domestic Abuse</li>
<li>Drug Addictions</li>
<li>Body Image/ Value of Self Worth</li>
<li>Life with furry loved ones</li>
<li>Acceptance of Death</li>
</ul>
<br/>You will love this book whether you feel compelled to believe in fate as a fortuitous energy of nature or a menacing and ruthless arch-nemesis in life’s metaphorical game of chess (where you are nothing more than a pawn), and by the power of energy, the power of luck, or sheer happenstance, this book has somehow integrated its way into your life and into your hands.<br/><br/><i>One Decision Away</i> speaks to those who want to be empowered as a human being, as more than a broken soul. Trauma and dysfunction displaced within our lives present opportunities to create life-enhancing decisions conducive to functionality in a turbulent world. Our willingness to harness these challenges and opportunities creates a fresh mindset of determination to create new opportunities for our own life. And perhaps, through the insight and perspective of those who share in our struggles within these stories, we too may discover inner peace and closure within our own lives. <br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>One Decision Away</i> inspires reflective and profound dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:<p> </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How is the trauma in my life affecting my personal and professional relationships? </strong></li>
<li><strong>How can I empower my life to deal with my trauma constructively, for the betterment of my self-preservation and inner peace? </strong></li>
<li>
<strong>How do these personal stories relate to those I love, and my own self worth? </strong><br/> </li>
</ul>
<p>I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. Coming together and discussing how embracing trauma through a conduit of grace and empowerment may change us all for the better. </p>

After extensive research and hearing others’ similar stories I felt the need to share what I learned through a book.<br/><br/>My name is Jennifer Garman and I am the author of Gratitude is the Answer. I wrote this book because I needed to share the life-altering effects gratitude can have on one’s life.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover why gratitude is so impactful, and how to implement it into your life. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for gratitude in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you implement gratitude and transform your life.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about why happiness is a choice and how gratitude can offset a negative mindset, including stories about:</p><ul>
<li>How a professional athlete at the peak of his career lost everything, but ultimately gained even more back than he had before tragedy hit.</li>
<li>How Sheryl Sandberg used gratitude to cope with losing her husband and find joy and happiness again in her life.</li>
<li>How a man who broke is back in a catastrophic accident and was told he would never walk again, yet through the power of his thoughts was able to regain his health entirely.</li>
</ul><p>You will love this book if you feel a lack of happiness, experience anxiety/depression, or are stuck in a negative mindset.<br/><br/>Gratitude is the Answer is a non-fiction book that speaks to anyone struggling or feeling at a loss in life and who are looking to transform their life through gratitude for the first time.</p><h3>The Book - Gratitude is the Answer</h3><p>The book is written in 3 Parts....<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the Introduction + Chapter 1. It all starts with my story. I explain in this part how I came to find gratitude coupled with the power of my thoughts, the effect it had on my health and life, and why I felt compelled to share this with others through a book.<br/><br/>Part 2 contains Chapters 2-8. In this section I will go into the science behind gratitude and the many ways it has been proven to impact one’s life in a positive way. These chapters also contain powerful inspirational stories from many people I interviewed and researched, and how gratitude has changed the trajectory of their life in amazing ways.<br/><br/>Part 3 contains Chapters 9-10. This is the part where you will learn how to implement gratitude into your life to have the biggest impact--it’s the “how to” section. I break it down into easy-to-implement chunks that you can incorporate into your busy schedule immediately, and see the transformational effect firsthand. After you are inspired by all those you will read about, I know you will want to add gratitude into your life as well.<br/> </p><h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3><p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<br/> </p><ul>

After extensive research and hearing others’ similar stories I felt the need to share what I learned through a book.My name is Jennifer Garman and I am the author of Gratitude is the Answer. I wrote this book because I needed to share the life-altering effects gratitude can have on one’s life.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover why gratitude is so impactful, and how to implement it into your life. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for gratitude in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you implement gratitude and transform your life.In this book, you'll learn about why happiness is a choice and how gratitude can offset a negative mindset, including stories about:
How a professional athlete at the peak of his career lost everything, but ultimately gained even more back than he had before tragedy hit.
How Sheryl Sandberg used gratitude to cope with losing her husband and find joy and happiness again in her life.
How a man who broke is back in a catastrophic accident and was told he would never walk again, yet through the power of his thoughts was able to regain his health entirely.
You will love this book if you feel a lack of happiness, experience anxiety/depression, or are stuck in a negative mindset.Gratitude is the Answer is a non-fiction book that speaks to anyone struggling or feeling at a loss in life and who are looking to transform their life through gratitude for the first time.The Book - Gratitude is the AnswerThe book is written in 3 Parts....Part 1 contains the Introduction + Chapter 1. It all starts with my story. I explain in this part how I came to find gratitude coupled with the power of my thoughts, the effect it had on my health and life, and why I felt compelled to share this with others through a book.Part 2 contains Chapters 2-8. In this section I will go into the science behind gratitude and the many ways it has been proven to impact one’s life in a positive way. These chapters also contain powerful inspirational stories from many people I interviewed and researched, and how gratitude has changed the trajectory of their life in amazing ways.Part 3 contains Chapters 9-10. This is the part where you will learn how to implement gratitude into your life to have the biggest impact--it’s the “how to” section. I break it down into easy-to-implement chunks that you can incorporate into your busy schedule immediately, and see the transformational effect firsthand. After you are inspired by all those you will read about, I know you will want to add gratitude into your life as well. What I Need & What You'll GetThis book will be published with New Degree Press.

<h3>""EmpowHered""</h3>
<p>Empowered: Reforming a Dismissive Health Care System. A book about how negative interactions with healthcare providers and the healthcare system can have a potentially dangerous impact on Black women and their health. And, what they can do to fight back.<br/><br/>My name is S. Mayumi “Umi” Grigsby and I am the author of Empowered: Leading the Fight to Reform a Dismissive Health Care System. I wrote this book because after doctors dismissed my pain for years, I diagnosed myself with what should have been an easily identifiable and treated illness. Although my story had a happy ending, I wondered if other women who looked like me had been treated the same way. They had. Now I am sharing my story and theirs and hope that this will lead to better outcomes for others.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that you are not alone, that you have power and agency, and that you can fight back when you feel dismissed. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for empowering women, and other marginalized communities including members of the LGBTQIA community to fight back against a sometimes dismissive healthcare system, in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to have in your toolbox in the event that you feel dismissed.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about personal stories of people - mostly Black women - who have had their pain dismissed and ignored.</p>
<p>‘Reese’, who’s story shows us the inadequacies in our sexual health education in public schools.</p>
<p>‘Lyle’, who’s story shows that some doctors are not trained to contextualize.</p>
<p>‘Sheila’, who did everything she could. She researched, tried to find a doctor she could trust, named it, framed it, advocated; tried to establish a rapport; and checked in with her community. Her story shows that you can do everything right and still not receive the care you deserve.</p>
<p>You will love this book if you want to know how a significant portion of the population experiences healthcare in the United States. For example healthcare professionals are less likely to take Black women’s health concerns seriously. Black women are up to four times more likely to die in child-birth than their White counterparts.<br/><br/>And, it is not only Black women. Although women are more likely to suffer from chronic pain than their male counterparts, doctors are more likely to dismiss women when they complain of pain. Doctors are more likely to tell younger women to lose weight, and at the same time will prescribe preventive therapy for their male counterparts. Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans- and Queer individuals are hesitant to access healthcare due to inappropriate questions and ill-informed doctors.<br/><br/>For Black women, living at the intersection of multiple forms of oppression, dismissal by doctors can be deadly. And this dismissal cannot be solely attributed to socio-economic status, class, or lack of health insurance.<br/><br/>Empowered: Leading the Fight to Reform a Dismissive Health Care System is a non-fiction book that speaks to women and specifically Black women and other marginalized individuals who are looking at navigating an often dismissive healthcare system and want to fight back and feel empowered.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Empowered: Leading the Fight to Reform a Dismissive Health Care System is written in 3 Parts....<br/><br/>Part [1] contains the introduction + additional chapters. Part 1 will detail the historical nature of the problem, leading to the status quo<br/><br/>Part [2] contains Chapters that will delve deeper into the problem and challenges currently facing Black women when navigating our healthcare system.<br/><br/>Part [3] contains Chapters that will propose solutions moving forward.</p>

<h3>The Author - Me!</h3>
<p>S. Mayumi “Umi” Grigsby is an attorney with a long history of advocating for policies that empower marginalized communities, particularly women and girls of color, to be the engineers of their own change.

She previously held a variety of roles locally, nationally, and internationally in grant-making, policy development and logistics, and in criminal justice and litigation.<br/><br/>She wrote this book in the hopes that telling her story and that of others, she can empower others to fight back against an increasingly dismissive healthcare system<br/><br/>She does not present herself as an expert, after years of spearheading community-led, data-informed change - this book is a realization of a life long dream to share her story in order to have a positive impact.<br/><br/>For more information you can connect with Mayumi at umigee2020@gmail.com and @empowheredhealth on instagram.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.<br/><br/>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.</p>

Empowered: Reforming a Dismissive Health Care System. A book about how negative interactions with healthcare providers and the healthcare system can have a potentially dangerous impact on Black women and their health. And, what they can do to fight back.My name is S. Mayumi “Umi” Grigsby and I am the author of Empowered: Leading the Fight to Reform a Dismissive Health Care System. I wrote this book because after doctors dismissed my pain for years, I diagnosed myself with what should have been an easily identifiable and treated illness. Although my story had a happy ending, I wondered if other women who looked like me had been treated the same way. They had. Now I am sharing my story and theirs and hope that this will lead to better outcomes for others.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that you are not alone, that you have power and agency, and that you can fight back when you feel dismissed. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for empowering women, and other marginalized communities including members of the LGBTQIA community to fight back against a sometimes dismissive healthcare system, in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to have in your toolbox in the event that you feel dismissed.In this book, you'll learn about personal stories of people - mostly Black women - who have had their pain dismissed and ignored.
‘Reese’, who’s story shows us the inadequacies in our sexual health education in public schools.
‘Lyle’, who’s story shows that some doctors are not trained to contextualize.
‘Sheila’, who did everything she could. She researched, tried to find a doctor she could trust, named it, framed it, advocated; tried to establish a rapport; and checked in with her community. Her story shows that you can do everything right and still not receive the care you deserve.
You will love this book if you want to know how a significant portion of the population experiences healthcare in the United States. For example healthcare professionals are less likely to take Black women’s health concerns seriously. Black women are up to four times more likely to die in child-birth than their White counterparts.And, it is not only Black women. Although women are more likely to suffer from chronic pain than their male counterparts, doctors are more likely to dismiss women when they complain of pain. Doctors are more likely to tell younger women to lose weight, and at the same time will prescribe preventive therapy for their male counterparts. Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans- and Queer individuals are hesitant to access healthcare due to inappropriate questions and ill-informed doctors.For Black women, living at the intersection of multiple forms of oppression, dismissal by doctors can be deadly. And this dismissal cannot be solely attributed to socio-economic status, class, or lack of health insurance.Empowered: Leading the Fight to Reform a Dismissive Health Care System is a non-fiction book that speaks to women and specifically Black women and other marginalized individuals who are looking at navigating an often dismissive healthcare system and want to fight back and feel empowered.
 
Empowered: Leading the Fight to Reform a Dismissive Health Care System is written in 3 Parts....Part [1] contains the introduction + additional chapters. Part 1 will detail the historical nature of the problem, leading to the status quoPart [2] contains Chapters that will delve deeper into the problem and challenges currently facing Black women when navigating our healthcare system.Part [3] contains Chapters that will propose solutions moving forward.

Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The ancient and powerful Arcana have fallen. The knowledge they recorded was lost. The artifacts they gathered from civilizations throughout the universe have been destroyed. Their ability to harness the powers of dark matter couldn’t save them. Many are dead. The rest are scattered. And the vengeful defector who brought them down has begun his hunt for the remaining survivors.</p>
<p>When sixteen-year-old Alexander learns he’s an Arcana, the hunt is already underway. All his gadgets, books, and plans to run away have to be put aside. And when James, the young alien instructed to take him to safety lapses him into the heart of enemy territory to settle a personal score, Alexander has no choice but to accept the responsibilities placed on him. That includes learning to wield his new-found dark matter abilities, even though he’d rather not. But nothing is as simple as it seems. Secrets have been kept. A truth has been hidden for thousands of years. If Alexander doesn’t learn who and what he actually is in time, it’s not just his life he’ll lose. Entire worlds will die with him.</p>
<p>Dark Rising is the first book of The Dark Matter Chronicles. It is a young-adult sci-fi/fantasy novel and is meant for anyone who loves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Young Adult books</li>
<li>Science Fiction</li>
<li>Fantasy</li>
<li>Adventure</li>
<li>Superheroes and superpowers (really, who doesn't love them?!)</li>
<li>Futuristic technology (nanotech, augmented reality, my own version of a super suit!!!)</li>
<li>Outer space and all its craziness</li>
<li>Physics</li>
<li>Science in general</li>
<li>Life, the universe, and everything ;)</li>
</ul>
<p>I intend to publish the book once this campaign is done. In the meantime, check out the Prologue here: <a href=""http://mxkremzen.com/about/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://mxkremzen.com/about/</a></p>

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>With your support, I'm hoping to get a professional cover made for the first book so it doesn't look like the work of a three-year-old, a proper website, and some marketing for the series once this campaign is complete.</p>
<p>What's in it for you?</p>
<p>$5- Lots of gratitude and an ecopy of the book</p>
<p>$10- The digital package: an ecopy of the book + a thank you on my site + more undying gratitude</p>
<p>$15- The super digital package: an ecopy of the book + an exclusive short story related to the book that will not be published elsewhere + a thank you on my site + more undying gratitude</p>
<p>$29- The paperback package: a signed and numbered limited edition, paperback copy of the book that will not be available anywhere else (makes a great Xmas gift...not too early to mention Xmas right?) + an ecopy of the book + an exclusive short story related to the book that will not be published elsewhere + a thank you on my site + even more undying gratitude (Shipping Included)</p>
<p>$50- The super paperback package*: 2 signed and numbered limited edition, paperback copies of the book that will not be available anywhere else, (1 for you and another as a great Xmas gift for someone awesome) + an ecopy of the book + an exclusive short story related to the book that will not be published elsewhere + a thank you on my site + a ridiculous amount of undying gratitude (Shipping Included)</p>
<p>$100- The ultra super unbelievable...Okay, it's the same as the previous level, but I might actually pass out from the dangerous levels of gratitude this will incur. Not enough, you say? What if I write you a personalized thank you letter as well? (Shipping Included)</p>
<p>*Please note: Paperback copies will be ordered after this campaign is completed, so it will take a few weeks for them to be produced and sent to you. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I think my book is worth a read but my opinion is a little biased, (just a little). What I can say, objectively, is that The Dark Matter Chronicles mixes physics, superheroes, aliens, space, and lots of new gadgets. Given the recent discoveries/growing interest in the field of science, (we love you, Higgs Boson, Curiousity Rover, and the all the weirdo Earth-like planets we keep finding out there), I think this is a great time to introduce the young adult audience to new worlds. </p>

<h3>The Passion of la Niña Milagros</h3>
<p><strong>I knew Milagros was exceptional the minute I heard her speak. </strong> We met 10 years ago in the English class I taught to mothers at a San Francisco public school. Immigration raids were going on and my students' families were being broken up. I wanted Americans to understand:<strong> These families are refugees from violence. Milagros is their voice--and she needs your help!</strong></p>

<p>Milagros is passionate and articulate, and has suffered trauma upon trauma.  <strong>How, I wondered, can a human being survive such terrible hardships and remain emotionally and spiritually intact? </strong></p>

As a child, Milagros asked God, Why do You allow people to hurt other people?  An answer did not come easily.  The book will reveal how Milagros developed emotionally and spiritually through powerful dreamlike experiences, and the dawning of a profound, pentecostal Christian faith.  
Now that I can work full-time on this project, we plan to finish up a chapter a month during 2017, and post them on our website as we go.  See our progress at http://www.MilagrosVela.com!
Your contribution will provide Milagros time and relief from economic pressure, so that she can continue to work with me articulating her hard-won insights.
Note: The photo of Milagros as a toddler is one of the only images we have from her childhood. The other photos you see here are from news reports.
 
Other Ways You Can Help

With this campaign we are also launching our effort to build an audience platform for Milagros' memoir.  When we approach agents and publishers, with your help we can point to a significant following.  Whether or not you can contribute financially, please give us a hand in the following ways:


Get the word out about this book.  Refer your friends and family to our website: http://www.MilagrosVela.com.  Please keep reading as we post a new chapter every month!
Please use the Indiegogo share tools to spread the word through social media.  Starting right now, we want people to hear our message about the struggles of Central American and other Latino refugees. We want caring people to support them in communities throughout the United States!",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Campaign Summary</h3>
<p>I am a life-long supporter of Scotland regaining its independence.  I am so committed to that belief that, finally, I realised I had to stop simply talking about it and get up off my backside and actually try and do something to bring that dream a little bit closer. That is what this campaign, <strong>Peep the Beeb</strong>, is all about. I should say here also that I am not a member of any political party. I simply believe Scotland can and should stand on its own two feet like any other small, self-respecting country.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What the campaign needs to succeed.</h3>
<p>An inital quantity of 35,000 sticky labels with the message 'BBC MISREPORTING SCOTLAND' will be printed for distribution throughout Scotland. This will cost £925.00 (+vat = £1110.00).</p>
<p>Packing and distribution will cost around £100.00.</p>
<p>Project Total = £1210.00</p>
<p>Plus Indigogo costs = £1270.00.</p>
<p>Any funds raised in excess of the campaign requirement will be donated to foodbanks across Scotland.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Campaign Impact</h3>
<p>It’s not yet been announced but everyone and their granny knows IndyRe#2 is on the table and will be announced in the not too distant. The SG is already preparing legislation for it.</p>
<p>That means we need to use the time we have NOW proactively. I say that because I very much suspect two things will happen:</p>
<p>1) IndyRef#2 will be called suddenly.<br/>2) It will be a very short campaign, 3-6 months max.</p>
<p>So we need to use the time we have to start campaigning NOW.</p>
<p>The first port of call must be to tackle the BBC's pro-UK broadcasts. IMO, they were the biggest contributer by far to YES losing last time with their relentless anti-indy broadcasts.</p>
<p>We obviously cannot stop their BritNat propaganda from being broadcast (it has never actually stopped) but we DO have the means to significantly dull its impact. The BBC may well control the airwaves but the PEOPLE control the streets.</p>
<p>We need to get stickers made with the simple message that the BBC cannot be trusted; a simple message that will make unaware Scots (soft NOs) sit up and take notice of what the BBC is doing. In short, if we are to win IndyRef#2, we <i>must </i>expose the BBC in Scotland for the propaganda unit of the London Government that it is. We must plant doubt in peoples’ minds about the BBC. We must damage its ‘undeserved credibility.</p>
<p>To do that we get up off our bums and get onto the streets and make our protest there. We get thousands of anti-BBC stickies printed (‘BBC Misreporting Scotland’) andwe give them to everyone and their granny to stick on their jackets, coats, bags etc. We get as many as we can to wear them and get the message out there that the BBC is not to be trusted and is effectively subverting Scotland's democracy. We get it so that the State Propaganda Unit can broadcast all day long but it is to no avail – the people will no longer be listening to them.</p>The campaign already has street distributors all over the country ready to go. But it now needs YOUR financial support to make it happen, to bring the Beeb's propaganda down to a small peep.</div><div>

<h3>Pourquoi ce livre ?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Patrice Dubreuil, petit-fils d’un des fondateurs de Dubreuilville, porte en lui depuis longtemps cette idée de livre. Depuis longtemps, il se pose les questions suivantes :<i> Comment transmettre à toute la communauté et aux générations futures l'histoire de notre famille et de ce village qu'ils ont créé, loin dans le bois ? et Comment la faire découvrir ailleurs au pays ?</i> C’est ainsi qu’il a approché notre maison d’édition, Prise de parole, de Sudbury, pour l’aider à réaliser ce rêve. Nous avons plongé sans hésiter dans ce projet de mise en valeur du patrimoine francophone du Nord de l’Ontario, Dubreuilville occupant déjà un espace mythique dans l'imaginaire de cette région.</li>
<li>Nous avons confié la recherche et la rédaction de cette histoire à deux jeunes chercheurs, Sophie Blais et Serge Dupuis. Appuyés par la famille Dubreuil, ils ont effectué un travail de terrain, dépouillant notamment les archives de la famille et de Dubreuil Brothers; ils ont effectué des recherches dans les journaux d’époque et interviewé des dizaines de personnes qui leur ont confié souvenirs et anecdotes; ils se sont aussi inspirés des témoignages écrits laissés par Pâquerette Dubreuil Desgagné et Napoléon Dubreuil. Il en résulte un livre vivant et amplement documenté, écrit dans un langue accessible à tous, comprenant de nombreuses photographies et des extraits de journaux personnels, qui saura intéresser :<ul>
<li>les personnes qui ont séjourné ou vécu à Dubreuilville, celles qui y vivent toujours, ainsi que tous les francophones du Nord de l’Ontario et du Canada;</li>
<li>toute personne qui s’intéresse à l’industrie du bois, à la foresterie et à l’entrepreneuriat, l'essentiel de l'ouvrage portant sur une période – les années 50 à 80 – de grands bouleversement au sein de cette industrie charnière de l’économie canadienne.</li>

<h3>About the book:</h3>
<p><span>The first line in “C”, “My mother has cancer,” foreshadows there are no happy endings in this book. In this poignant debut, “you can’t take it with you when you die: memoirs” we are taken on a journey of loss.</span><br/><span>Through eighteen essays, we are give</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">n a razor-sharp view of how losing someone to a friendship or relationship failure, or death, can forever change the person we thought we were.<br/>In “Emergency”, commencing the second part of the book, Marsh tells the story of the tested love he has for his sister, Marie, and the ultimate sacrifice he made by cutting ties with her.<br/>The most arresting essay, “Sex”, Marsh details five early sexual relationships he says, “Made me an adult.” “Absent”, will surely be the most shocking and discussed of the lot; a foray into the relationship with his estranged father. “Taken”, a stark account of rape, is told without a sliver of self-pity. “Quiet”, the most disturbing, a friend reveals his dark side. In “Snow”, Marsh and his girlfriend are faced with a decision that will forever affect their lives. Three beautiful essays, “Christmas”, “Peace”, and the finale, “Ephemera”, have endings you won’t want to spoil, keeping his secrets as if your own.<br/>Often told in the present tense and with an exemplary command of dialogue, Marsh uses quotation marks only once. Accessible, “you can’t take it with you when you die”, a grand debut on what it means to live, love, and lose, will surely find itself a mainstay in classic memoir.</span></p>

</div></div>","About the book:
The first line in “C”, “My mother has cancer,” foreshadows there are no happy endings in this book. In this poignant debut, “you can’t take it with you when you die: memoirs” we are taken on a journey of loss.Through eighteen essays, we are given a razor-sharp view of how losing someone to a friendship or relationship failure, or death, can forever change the person we thought we were.In “Emergency”, commencing the second part of the book, Marsh tells the story of the tested love he has for his sister, Marie, and the ultimate sacrifice he made by cutting ties with her.The most arresting essay, “Sex”, Marsh details five early sexual relationships he says, “Made me an adult.” “Absent”, will surely be the most shocking and discussed of the lot; a foray into the relationship with his estranged father. “Taken”, a stark account of rape, is told without a sliver of self-pity. “Quiet”, the most disturbing, a friend reveals his dark side. In “Snow”, Marsh and his girlfriend are faced with a decision that will forever affect their lives. Three beautiful essays, “Christmas”, “Peace”, and the finale, “Ephemera”, have endings you won’t want to spoil, keeping his secrets as if your own.Often told in the present tense and with an exemplary command of dialogue, Marsh uses quotation marks only once. Accessible, “you can’t take it with you when you die”, a grand debut on what it means to live, love, and lose, will surely find itself a mainstay in classic memoir.

You know, subtle things like, ""So what about that book, Mosley?!"" After much prodding I finally listened and I've spent the last year writing, re-writing and editing these short poems, which I've now come to adore.Through this journey I've learned how much can be said in just 17 syllables, how powerful words are, and how it may be true that everyone has at least one book lurking inside them.Beyond the absolute personal joy that I'll get from having an actual published book to share with all of you. I'm even more excited to share these poems with people who haven't yet encountered them. I've worked very hard to provide a daily dose of love, nostalgia, sage wisdom (...from a 32 year old :-)), a chuckle, and possibly a little relief from some of life's tough moments.I thank you so much for being on this journey with me. Truly. And I will continue to keep you posted on all that's happening along the way!What We Need & What You GetWhy $3000?I want to be clear that none of the funds you donate will go into my own pocket. Because this book has come from community, all funds will go back into the community.Specifically: $2500 will cover the cost of publishing (including page layout, cover creation & printing of 50 books); the other $500 will cover the printing of any books over the included 50 and shipping costs to send you your signed copy!Any money that goes unused or that is collected above the $3000 goal will be donated to www.writegirl.org.In addition to your book, I'll be throwing in some really fun perks including: signed scripts from my shows, studio tours, personalized haikus and, my personal favorite, a veggie dinner party in LA and/or NY hosted by me!!!!Plus, there will be more surprises along the way, so stay tuned....Other Ways You Can HelpIn addition to donating you can help me spread the word! Everything works better with a team, so please join mine!! (Don't worry, we always win.) *Let your friends and family know about the campaign, those I might not be able to reach on my own or haven't reached yet.*Post, Post & Re-Post the link to your social media sites and tell your folks why you are excited to be a part of creating this book.*Brainstorm! I'd LOVE to hear your ideas about how I can spread the word, perks you'd like to see listed and places you'd like to see the book.And most of all THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</b></p><h2>Smoking Glue Gun + Chapbooks = Love</h2><b>
</b><p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Hi, we're Blake
Lee Pate and Taylor Jacob Pate, the editors of Smoking Glue Gun. Smoking Glue Gun is an independent online magazine run out of our home in Austin, Texas. We're passionate about finding innovative, striking art and writing—in the last two years we’ve published over 100 writers and artists on <a href=""www.smokinggluegun.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">smokinggluegun.com</a>. </p><p><b>We’re excited to tell you we'll soon become a magazine &amp; chapbook press. </b></p><p>This spring we plan to release <i><b>Sunburn / Freezer Burn</b></i>, an art and poetry chapbook by Colleen Barry, and<b> </b><i><b>Pattern
Exhaustion</b>, </i>a new chapbook by poet and editor Nate Pritts. We’re young poets ourselves, and we’re dedicated to putting new voices into the community. But we need to raise
$2,000 to cover the cost of printing these chapbooks. So we're turning to you,
our oldest and newest readers, to ask for help. </p><p>Your contribution will aid in
funding the printing of <i><b>Pattern
Exhaustion</b> </i>and <i><b>Sunburn / Freezer Burn</b></i>,
and if we meet our goal, allow us to continue printing chapbooks in the future.
In exchange for your support, we’re offering you the first copies of the chapbooks, as well as sneak-release PDFs, signed copies, broadsides, art prints, and even one of Colleen Barry’s original drawings. The chapbooks are printed on a limited run, so this is our chance to make sure they reach the hands of our strongest supporters. Your contribution not only supports our
small press and these shining poets, it also aids our effort to showcase more
poetry &amp; art in the future. 
Thanks!</p><h3>

Exhaustion</b> is arresting
in its contention between stillness and life. The I of this broken long poem is at once human and ghost—startlingly close, and disconnected. The poem begins with the lines, “I
forget myself / but I remember the morning,” and page after page we are
humored, held close, ruined, and renewed. If a reader recoils from <b>Pattern Exhaustion</b>, it is because the
poem presents the truth, just to uncover it and reveal the heart beneath, mechanical and raw and beating.</blockquote><blockquote>Nate Pritts is the author of six books of poetry, and the the founder of H_NGM_N, an online journal and small press. The undisguised sincerity of Nate's poems immediately struck our hearts when we first published his poems in Volume 2, and we've been in touch with him since—he is a strong supporter of new poets and small press publishing, as well as an extremely generous and kind person. <i><br/></i>

shining treasure box. These poems and—as Barry considers them—poem-drawings, create a land of apocalyptic whispers, bleak confessions, wild colors, and weird
love. Barry’s left-handed drawings are at once delightful and haunting. Together with her poems, they put the reader through a brutal kind of nostalgia. When
Dean Young read the manuscript, he wrote, “It is as if Colleen Louise Barry has
made an atom bomb out of a pencil, a rubber band and a band-aid.”</blockquote><blockquote>Colleen Barry is a poet, artist, and teacher living in
Western Massachusetts, and a graduate student in the

Your commitment to this campaign is also a commitment to the life blood of poetry and art.

The Perks!</h3>
<p></p>
<p>As we
mentioned above, Smoking Glue Gun is independently run, so we're funded
out-of-pocket. We’re asking for your help in raising the funds to print our first run of chapbooks. Your contribution to this campaign will be directly applied to the cost of printing and binding Smoking Glue Gun chapbooks, and the chapbook campaign materials (broadsides &amp; prints). Your contribution will also cover the cost of shipping your perks. </p>
<p><b>So let’s
talk about the perks:</b> first off, we’re offering every supporter a pre-order
of one or both chapbooks—it's a limited run, so get your hands on them quickly! And don’t
worry if you can’t wait to get them in the mail—<b>The Insider’s Club</b> includes an immediate sneak-release PDF of both chapbooks, and a signed copy of each chap. </p>
<p>We at Smoking Glue Gun love to combine art and writing: <b>The Left-Handed Draw</b> includes a print of Colleen's drawing, ""Pez Prez,"" from <i>Sunburn / Freezer Burn, </i>as well as both chaps. <b>The Brooding Broad</b> includes the chaps and a broadside from <i>Pattern Exhaustion</i>, designed by editor Taylor Jacob Pate.</p>
<p>For those of you who, like us, just can't get enough of these poets, we're offering <b>The SGG Lover</b>. Complete with both signed chapbooks, a broadside from <i>Pattern Exhaustion, </i>an art print from <i>Sunburn / Freezer Burn</i>, and a handwritten note from the SGG editors. It's really the complete package. But that's not all:  <b>The Collector: Barry</b> makes you the owner of the original drawing, ""Pez Prez,"" as well as both signed chapbooks, and a note from the editors. Or, choose <b>The Collector: Pritts</b>, and receive the original <i>Pattern Exhaustion </i>broadside design, painted by editor Taylor Jacob Pate.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p>                                  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/304309/files/20140112100652-pez_prez.jpg?1389550012"" src="""" style=""width: 286px; height: 372px;""/></p><blockquote style=""text-align: center;"">     Colleen Barry's ""Pez Prez."" Original and prints available!</blockquote><p></p><h3><b>Other Ways

</div></div>","Angels Fight Demons and ""Feds"" In Chicago!       

    Based on true events that actually took place in Chicago, Illinois, Demons of Federal Misconduct: 
A Chicago Memoir! is an enthralling book, and ""controversial"" legal drama one could easily liken to novels written by John Grisham.  It also bears an uncanny resemblance to This Present Darkness
and Piercing the Darkness, two bestselling
fiction works by Christian author Frank E. Peretti, and includes angels, demons, a federal investigation, and the FBI.  But there is one significant difference between those books
and this one: this book is not-fiction!  It is a true story!


   Author Christopher Myron Claxton, Ph.D., MBA, and ordained Christian minister meticulously enumerates his belief that Satan used three demon spirits to influence
certain feds to destroy his Christian business (and popular radio program), and the Christian law practice of his business associate - just because they brought
glory to God. The author deftly guides
his readers into the ""unseen"" world of spiritual warfare, including an
epic, supernatural battle between angels and demons inside the Dirksen Federal
Building in Chicago!  
   This 450-page modern day nonfiction ""case study"" in spiritual warfare in the 21st century U. S. Justice System and Corporate Chicago is brought to a resounding crescendo as God intervenes on behalf
of the author and his business associate through the U. S. Supreme Court, former President George W. Bush, and other honest federal officials, including President Barack Obama!
   Christopher Myron Claxton is
a native of Detroit, Michigan, where he attended high school with world-renowned (retired) pediatric neurosurgeon, 2016 Presidential Candidate, and bestselling Christian author, Dr. Ben Carson.   Mr. Claxton holds a Ph.D. in Social Science; an MBA in Accounting and Behavioral Sciences from the University of Chicago; a Master’s degree in History; and a Bachelor’s degree in Finance from Michigan State University.   Dr. Claxton is a former Lecturer in Finance at DePaul University in Chicago and presently teaches business and social
sciences in Chicagoland.  He also studied
at the Moody Bible Institute, and is presently a Bible college teacher of Prophecy and Biblical Eschatology.  Dr. Claxton has over 40 years
experience as a businessman and as an educator; and has served over 37 years in
Christian ministry.  Dr. Claxton
and his wife, Bonita, have been married for 43 years.  They have four adult children and six  grandchildren.
   Although it reads like a science fiction thriller or like a story from the Bible,  ""Demons of Federal
Misconduct:  A Chicago Memoir!"" is a true story, that is a “must-read” for everybody!  (In fact, should you choose to preview any of the selected Chapter Links that I have provided below--either in print or audio, I believe that you will find them quite enjoyable and edifying.  The audio versions of Chapters 6 & 13 feature ""demonspeak,""  which is an integral part of the legal chapters!)                                     ANGEL INVESTMENT CIRCULAR

<h2>What Storms May Come</h2>
<h2><img alt=""Angela receiving Sacramental Anointing of the Sick from Fr. John Parks"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/310912_264660456919697_182849791767431_848208_306115043_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">A year ago, my wife Angela was diagnosed with Stage IV Colon Cancer which had spread to the liver and was given very little hope of cure or survival. He diagnosis was a shock - both because of her age and preceding excellent health, and because she had no warning signs previous to developing a complete blockage in her colon.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""> </p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">It was Easter Sunday and as many were heading to Church, we would learn the most difficult news of our lives. Angela's words to me in those moments following the initial news were, <em><strong>""Jesus still rose, and so we are going to trust.""</strong> </em></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Resurrection day took on a whole new meaning for our family that day. In the hours following, I asked Angela if it was okay for me to post the news and request prayers. She agreed and we posted the news to Facebook asking for urgent prayers. The amazing response that came in over those few days and the months since have been incredible. Promises of prayers said, Masses offered, candles lit and more have continued to come in from people all over the country and even a few from around the world. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""> </p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The past year has been one of tremendous struggle, but also one in which God has proved his love over and over again. It is often hard for us to see that love through the difficult and challenging battles along the way. We have been so grateful for the continued prayers and support of so many friends and loved ones and complete strangers who continue to pray for us and encourage us on this road. </span><span class=""s2""> </span></p>
<p class=""p2""> </p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Early on in this journey, I remember sharing that we felt that God was going to use our trial for his glory. Indeed the many emails and comments we've received from so many are about the ways in which our story has inspired or encouraged their faith or their marriage. I'm not sure we are deserving of this credit - indeed it is only God's working that has kept us faithful during this year. But, God uses us in ways we never could have imagined sometimes.</span> </p>
<h2 class=""p4""><span class=""s3""><a href=""http://igg.me/p/99783?a=53251"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong><em>It is Well</em></strong> - Life in the Storm</a></span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The song, ""It is Well"" has long been a favorite of ours and the story behind the song is an incredible example of the kind of faith it takes to get through such a difficult trial. The song was not written in the organ loft of a Church, or on a mountain top retreat.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Horatio Spafford wrote the words as he traveled on a ship from the U.S. to England to meet his wife who had gone ahead to England with their four daughters. During their trip, the ship capsized and Spafford's four daughters died. His wife was all he had left. Having already lost much of his property to the Great Chicago fires and his only son, Spafford was most definitely in the darkest part of his life. Yet, as he passed over the spot where his daughters had died, he wrote the words ""Whatever my lot, thou has taught me to say, it is well, it is well, it is well with my soul."" The song was later put to music by Philip Bliss and the rest is history. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This image of Spafford passing over the greatest storm of his life and penning these words is one that gives us a great deal of hope. If a man can lose it all and lose it all again and again and still say these words, then truly his grace is sufficient for us no matter the storm. This past year has certainly been a year of learning to say, ""It is Well"" while passing through this storm.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><img alt=""It is Well"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/222328/primary_pictures/full/20120427172835-it_is_well_image.001.jpg?1335572916"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>With this inspiration in mind, Angela and I have set out to tell our story in a book that we're calling, <em>It is Well - Life in the Storm. </em>The book will be a memoir detailing the accounts of our last year and how God has continued to strengthen us throughout this storm and given us hope. We certainly do not have the corner on suffering, however we hope and pray that this book will be an encouragement to many who are dealing with similar trials in life. </span></p>
<p>While we are Catholic, we believe our story can be of help to any Christian and even non-Christians. So our book will be written with that in mind. We will not hide our faith, but we also hope to make this story accesible.</p>
<p>I (Chris) will be the primary writer, but Angela will chime in with her own thoughts and reflections throughout.</p>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order for us to write and publish this book we need your help.There are a lot of costs involved in publishing a book. We've decided to self-publish as it's the best thing for us. The book can be published sooner and more of the income from the sales will help our family directly as opposed to helping a publishing company. However, we still want this book to be done well. So we have hired an editor to work with me through the process, will hire a designer to professionally design the cover and layout. Also, some of the funds will help offset my income during the writing process so we can be sure the book is done in a timely fashion. Plus there are marketing costs as well in order to be sure the book get's out. </p>
<p>All of these things take money. So we are asking you to come alongside us in making this book a reality. We are launching this crowdfunding campaign to fund the writing, editing, design and publishing of this book. <strong>Our goal is $15,000</strong> and will provide for three months time for writing and editing along with hiring an editor and paying for the graphic design/layout as well as the printing of the book. </p>
<p>The goal is to have the book written by the end of June and then revisions/editing during the month of July with a publish date of sometime in August. After perks are rewarded, we'll then release the book to the public in September.</p>
<h3>Perks</h3>
<p>You can give any amount. However, we have set up some perks on the right that you can take advantage of. But any amount is a great blessing. The perks include anything from a digital download of the book to multiple copies of the book, or dinner w/our family and Grammy Nominated Christian Artist, <a href=""http://www.mattmahermusic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Matt Maher</a>. There is also a perk for parishes who would want to share the book with their Church. </p>
<h3>What It Will Take</h3>
<p><span>What will it take to get there?</span><br/><span>-If 600 people give $25 - we would reach our goal.</span><br/><span>-If 200 people give $75 - we would reach our goal.</span><br/><span>-If 60 people give $250 - we would reach our goal.</span><br/><span>-If 10 people gave $1500 - we would reach our goal.</span></p>
<p>What if you raise more?</p>
<p>If we raise more than the $15,000 we will buy more copies of the book to cover perks and there are a few additional projects that go along with the book that we may use the funds for - also any excess amounts will go back to our family for support and medical costs. Our hope is to begin an emergency fund for our family that will offset things during the times when it is hard for me to work, etc.</p>
<p>If we raise less than the $15,000 - we have a backup plan for getting the book published and printing enough copies to cover the perks.</p>

SUPPORT ANGELA FADDIS
 
Only a few hours left! 
This campaign is almost up. Unfortunately we have a ways to go towards our goal, however - we will still write the book. 
We are $1500 from our ""plan b"" goal which will still allow us the funds needed to write/edit/publish the book. We'll print less copies and make a few cuts, but can make it happen if we raise another $1500 in the next 15 hours!  
Thanks to all of you who have already given! 
Sincerely,
Chris Faddis

Watch Chris & Angela's Interview on Catholics Matter
We were interviewed for a local TV segment that airs after the televised Mass each Sunday in the Phoenix area. You can see that interview about this project and our journey by clicking here.

----- 
What Storms May Come

A year ago, my wife Angela was diagnosed with Stage IV Colon Cancer which had spread to the liver and was given very little hope of cure or survival. He diagnosis was a shock - both because of her age and preceding excellent health, and because she had no warning signs previous to developing a complete blockage in her colon.
 
It was Easter Sunday and as many were heading to Church, we would learn the most difficult news of our lives. Angela's words to me in those moments following the initial news were, ""Jesus still rose, and so we are going to trust."" 
Resurrection day took on a whole new meaning for our family that day. In the hours following, I asked Angela if it was okay for me to post the news and request prayers. She agreed and we posted the news to Facebook asking for urgent prayers. The amazing response that came in over those few days and the months since have been incredible. Promises of prayers said, Masses offered, candles lit and more have continued to come in from people all over the country and even a few from around the world. 
 
The past year has been one of tremendous struggle, but also one in which God has proved his love over and over again. It is often hard for us to see that love through the difficult and challenging battles along the way. We have been so grateful for the continued prayers and support of so many friends and loved ones and complete strangers who continue to pray for us and encourage us on this road.  
 
Early on in this journey, I remember sharing that we felt that God was going to use our trial for his glory. Indeed the many emails and comments we've received from so many are about the ways in which our story has inspired or encouraged their faith or their marriage. I'm not sure we are deserving of this credit - indeed it is only God's working that has kept us faithful during this year. But, God uses us in ways we never could have imagined sometimes. 
It is Well - Life in the Storm
The song, ""It is Well"" has long been a favorite of ours and the story behind the song is an incredible example of the kind of faith it takes to get through such a difficult trial. The song was not written in the organ loft of a Church, or on a mountain top retreat.
Horatio Spafford wrote the words as he traveled on a ship from the U.S. to England to meet his wife who had gone ahead to England with their four daughters. During their trip, the ship capsized and Spafford's four daughters died. His wife was all he had left. Having already lost much of his property to the Great Chicago fires and his only son, Spafford was most definitely in the darkest part of his life. Yet, as he passed over the spot where his daughters had died, he wrote the words ""Whatever my lot, thou has taught me to say, it is well, it is well, it is well with my soul."" The song was later put to music by Philip Bliss and the rest is history. 
This image of Spafford passing over the greatest storm of his life and penning these words is one that gives us a great deal of hope. If a man can lose it all and lose it all again and again and still say these words, then truly his grace is sufficient for us no matter the storm. This past year has certainly been a year of learning to say, ""It is Well"" while passing through this storm.
With this inspiration in mind, Angela and I have set out to tell our story in a book that we're calling, It is Well - Life in the Storm. The book will be a memoir detailing the accounts of our last year and how God has continued to strengthen us throughout this storm and given us hope. We certainly do not have the corner on suffering, however we hope and pray that this book will be an encouragement to many who are dealing with similar trials in life. 
While we are Catholic, we believe our story can be of help to any Christian and even non-Christians. So our book will be written with that in mind. We will not hide our faith, but we also hope to make this story accesible.
I (Chris) will be the primary writer, but Angela will chime in with her own thoughts and reflections throughout.

What We Need & What You Get
In order for us to write and publish this book we need your help.There are a lot of costs involved in publishing a book. We've decided to self-publish as it's the best thing for us. The book can be published sooner and more of the income from the sales will help our family directly as opposed to helping a publishing company. However, we still want this book to be done well. So we have hired an editor to work with me through the process, will hire a designer to professionally design the cover and layout. Also, some of the funds will help offset my income during the writing process so we can be sure the book is done in a timely fashion. Plus there are marketing costs as well in order to be sure the book get's out. 
All of these things take money. So we are asking you to come alongside us in making this book a reality. We are launching this crowdfunding campaign to fund the writing, editing, design and publishing of this book. Our goal is $15,000 and will provide for three months time for writing and editing along with hiring an editor and paying for the graphic design/layout as well as the printing of the book.

<p>Joakim Larsen captures the love of this beautiful country and its people by passing the naked skin in the meeting with another person to be portrayed. He is as such not only an excellent photographer, but also a pioneer who adds his pictures a life-spark through the portrayal of their lives for the good and, unfortunately, also much bad. As he aptly expects this meeting will 'Whatever happens' be a 'part of the experience' (Joakim Larsen).</p>

<p>Not only is Joakim a brilliant photographer but he has a passion for the people of Ethiopia as well as their many and varied stories.</p>
<p>This project is about the people who make up this land as told by them....the stories of the people who live here and shape this country. Joakim beautifully captures their spirit in photos that move beyond the usual travel observations.</p>
<p>I have watched Joakim's love for this country grow and have seen how he is able to show the beauty and soul of people living within an ancient culture rapidly moving into the modern world.</p>
<p>It is a project worthy of all the support it can receive. This is a story from the heart of the people who make Ethiopia what is and what it will become.</p>

</div></div>","Introduction 
Ethiopia From Within is a book project about the people of Ethiopia - a portrait of the Ethiopians. The purpose is to contribute with understanding and knowledge about the lives, traditions and customs of the Ethiopians and thereby contribute to improve the image of the country. 
Through personal encounters and conversations and in collaboration with the local population, I will seek to make this an authentic and beautiful portrait - a portrait of the people, as it is given by the people. 
For more detailed information, please visit www.VenturePress.dk 




What is needed 
I need help to cover three basic costs: day-pays for the Ethiopians who take time to engage in the conversations, salaries for the translators and a beautiful layout of the book.
Other expenses, like flight tickets, guest house, food, motorcycle maintenance, benzene, camera and recording equipement, will be covered by me. 
Giving the people a voice
The book will be based on personal encounters and conversations with people from around the country. And by giving the people a voice, the goal is to have the people tell about themselves, their lives and their ways. 


Why this book matters
The image of Ethiopia is often distorted and bad. Reminiscences from the humanitarian disaster in 1983-85 still linger in the minds of many Westerners. 
But as many economists agree, there is a positive correlation between the image of a country and its financial state. And the situation has changed a lot in Ethiopia since that 1985; in so many ways Ethiopia is evolving into a modern African country. And the kind and hospitable people and the ethnic and cultural diversity that is nothing but captivating, make this a country unique.
I feel obliged to show this - because it is fair, because it is needed, and because I have the opportunity to do so.

My name is Joakim Larsen. I am a photographer and writer from Copenhagen Denmark and owner of VenturePress.dk.
I know Ethiopia well and have a profound affection and respect for this unique country and its people. I speak the language and have a good network of people, who can be hired in at different stages of the book. 


When will the project start
The work with the project began in October 2014 and is now in its initial fase. Preparations are made for the first trip, which is scheduled to begin on November 5, 2014. And throughout the winter of 2014-15 the people of the 9 different regions of the country will be visited. I anticipate that the book is ready in October 2015.
Progress of the project will be posted regularly on VenturePress.dk


This project matters. 
Please support it.

Testimonials byEthiopia From Within is a project that you can enjoy supporting. Historically most articles about Ethiopia portray its citizens as being hapless victims of poverty.Nothing could be further from the truth and Joakim who has spent the last 3 years meeting and listening to them talking about their lives, dreams, culture and history is the person to bring their voices to the wider world.Through pictures and their words they will show a country of fabulous ethnic diversity, sheer beauty and the history of the development of a nation and its communities from ancient times to the modern day. A place that is as rich and successful as any nation in the world.Reading it will be a truly uplifting experience.Stephen Whaley, England, Enterprising Ethiopia (www.enterprisingethiopia.com)* * *
In his own pace, Joakim Larsen, author and photographer, succeeds to create the ultimate connection through the conversation with the individual Ethiopian men and women. The beautiful rousing photos, each of which accompanies the conversation and advocating vitality despite often difficult circumstances, insist on a willpower we Westerners often deselect through ways of abundant donations.
Joakim Larsen captures the love of this beautiful country and its people by passing the naked skin in the meeting with another person to be portrayed. He is as such not only an excellent photographer, but also a pioneer who adds his pictures a life-spark through the portrayal of their lives for the good and, unfortunately, also much bad. As he aptly expects this meeting will 'Whatever happens' be a 'part of the experience' (Joakim Larsen).
I highly recommend Joakim Larsen is supported in this project's coming to life.
Conny Bendixen Danielsson, Denmark, Psychologist, Candidate in Psychology

It is an honour to endorse Joakim Larsen's ambitious project, ETHIOPIA FROM WITHIN. 
Not only is Joakim a brilliant photographer but he has a passion for the people of Ethiopia as well as their many and varied stories.
This project is about the people who make up this land as told by them....the stories of the people who live here and shape this country. Joakim beautifully captures their spirit in photos that move beyond the usual travel observations.
I have watched Joakim's love for this country grow and have seen how he is able to show the beauty and soul of people living within an ancient culture rapidly moving into the modern world.
It is a project worthy of all the support it can receive. This is a story from the heart of the people who make Ethiopia what is and what it will become.

I have always searched for truth and knowledge in my art and creations, allowing them to take me on my journey, to my inner spirit, to connect. I was rewarded, had successes, was recognized. Still I was unhappy, unfulfilled, over weight, angry, lonely, hurt and fearful. </span></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 1.45em;"">For the last 8 years I have begun looking at my creative spirit, my consciousness,and my unconscious.  I craved knowledge about unknown topics, magic, intuition, spirits, sound therapy, frequency, energy, planetary alignments, corruption, lies, truth, aliens, ancient history, our beginning, our bodies, identity, expression, metaphysics, everything. I needed to understand life, my life, the big whys. I needed to be happy and expressive and powerful. I needed to be free. There had to be more than what we are being shown as a model for a happy life. I knew as an artist, as a creator, that we were all taught to be </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.8999999761581421px;"">uncreative</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 1.45em;""> by society, to not respect or learn about our 'out there' senses. Our creativity was to be used to make us consume.  This kind of success didn't seem to be making anyone happy to me. It all made me more than a little sick. We are discouraged from asking these kinds of questions, but I had to. As I did this my world and consciousness expanded even more, calling it into my awareness, expanding my intuitive abilities, my UNDERSTANDING of my intuitive abilities and then I began to think about sharing this with the world. That was Lesson One in how to steer my life, how to call and manipulate energy for the life I wanted.

Still I was unhappy, unfulfilled, over weight, angry, lonely, hurt and fearful. For the last 8 years I have begun looking at my creative spirit, my consciousness,and my unconscious.  I craved knowledge about unknown topics, magic, intuition, spirits, sound therapy, frequency, energy, planetary alignments, corruption, lies, truth, aliens, ancient history, our beginning, our bodies, identity, expression, metaphysics, everything. I needed to understand life, my life, the big whys. I needed to be happy and expressive and powerful. I needed to be free. There had to be more than what we are being shown as a model for a happy life. I knew as an artist, as a creator, that we were all taught to be uncreative by society, to not respect or learn about our 'out there' senses. Our creativity was to be used to make us consume.  This kind of success didn't seem to be making anyone happy to me. It all made me more than a little sick. We are discouraged from asking these kinds of questions, but I had to. As I did this my world and consciousness expanded even more, calling it into my awareness, expanding my intuitive abilities, my UNDERSTANDING of my intuitive abilities and then I began to think about sharing this with the world. That was Lesson One in how to steer my life, how to call and manipulate energy for the life I wanted. I had to learn more and then I had to share this.For the past three years I have been creating mental exercises that I decided to call meditations, but they are more than that, they are affirmations, but they are more than that, they are metaphysical calling tools, ways for us to learn about ALL of our senses, abilities  In Metaphysics we hear to FEEL our loves and desires, well my Radiant Meditations help us practice this feeling, this powerful calling. We learn to Drive the Body Vehicle probably for the first time. We learn about our fears and internal blockages and how they are connected to our outer world. The Your Radiant Life Book teaches us the theory and shares with us my journey.  Radiant Life Principals and Tools teach us to be better internal listeners.Just in Time For the New Time of Aquarius.  a bit about me

by Keith M. Layton, Complete Do Your EggI have been working with the Do Your Egg material for about a month now and I am finding this series of guided meditations to be effective in processing the energetic mental emotional and physical issues that are coming up for me as I continue to work on healing early childhood trauma.I started meditating 35 years ago and have been doing a buddhist meditation practice consistently for the past 5 year...Shae does a good job of explaining the basic 7 chakra system and the intentions of each meditation as well, making this material suitable for beginners as well as experienced energy healers. This is a good course for people interested in coming into conscious awareness of and Involvement with good energetic health and hygiene.
by Ashlee MacEwen, Amazing Guidance Shae is so knowledgeable, non-judgemental, truly a spirit that wants to help others find their right path with her supportive guidance

by Trisha Clarkin, 6 months agoEmpowering Having worked with Shae one on one, and doing her do your egg meditation, has helped me to feel better:) I am thankful!



BRILLIANT, ACTIVE AND POWERFUL!!

by Lorie Roerden,Shae Vere's meditations are Brilliant, Active and Powerful! I have been meditating for most of my life and have never found such clearing, empowering and actively moving energetic meditations in my experience. These meditations have assisted me in removing and releasing energy blocks, removing fear patterns, energetically freeing myself from old worn out programming, helping me open my heart, connect to The Earth Mother, Feel who I truly am and release my pain. Shae is a brilliantly connected and an inspirational teacher who guides with love and opens me up to my own true power to transform and become my highest and best self. I highly recommend working with Shae, doing her meditations and opening up to all the possibilities that unfold from within. With Love and Joy, Lorie Roerden~

Help Change The World                            One Person At A Time
 I see the earth going through so much change and harm. I see our disconnection, our disbelief. As an Empath and Intuitive I feel our pain for both sides of this reality. I see that we can learn how to use metaphysical principals and the magic of our own bodies and abilities to bring ourselves out of this muck we are now stuck in collectively  This is the Radiant Life Way, through creative spirit and expression in our lives.



I believe in us. In Our Hearts. In our Spirit. In Our Journey. I believe In our creative potential. I believe in our abilities to change everything.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <p>Hi, I am Sue Holloway.  I am a homeschooling mother of two, an entrepreneur, an artist, and an educator.  I have worked with children for over twenty years, the last ten as the founder and teacher of The Forest School - An Alternative Learning Centre in South Gillies, Ontario.  In all that I do, I love to share with others the wonder of what is, and in the case of <i><strong>A World Worth Imagining</strong></i>, the wonder of what could be.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in my video, I'm a believer and I truly believe there is hope for our future and for a world our kids can look forward to.   I also believe, now more than ever, our kids and all of us really, need to be seeing the images and hearing the voices that speak of hope.  And so, I wrote this story.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>THE INSPIRATION</h3>
<p><i><strong>A World Worth Imagining</strong></i> was inspired by a wonderful group of young people I have taught for many years.  One Earth Day morning standing by our pond, I invited the children to close their eyes and imagine what it might look like in one hundred years.  One of the girls refused, believing that the world would have been destroyed by then.  There was sadness in her eyes as she spoke and I realized then, that our young people understand the crisis facing the planet and its people, that message is coming to them loud and clear.  They hear it, feel it, and they understand the responsibility that comes with it.  What they are not hearing are the voices of visionaries and dreamers, those who can see the possibilities of a new and brighter future. </p>
<p>On that morning sitting by the pond, I committed to creating a different kind of story for our children, one with a different kind of message -- hope.</p>
<p>And here it is!!!  <i><strong>A World Worth Imagining. </strong></i></p>
<p>I have read versions of this story to that same group of kids for the last four Earth Days,  and we all agree, it's ready!  It has been quite the journey so far, but it's not over.   It is time to get it out to the world and to help it be one of those voices that inspires hope in the hearts  of others.</p>
<p>I would love if you helped me make this happen!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>THE STORY</h3>
<p><i><strong>A World Worth Imagining</strong></i> is seen through the eyes of a young girl in the future reflecting on the beauty of her world.  Seeing all that she has, it is hard for her to imagine the world the elders speak of-- the time when many were driven by fear and self -interest, when the earth was sick from the ways of the people and needed to fight back to reclaim its balance.  She wonders about the bravery and determination it must have taken for her ancestors to forge a new path.  With gratitude, the young girl looks down on her village and sees what becomes in a world guided by respect and compassion.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>THE ILLUSTRATOR</h3>
<p>The search for the perfect illustrator has taken a few years.  I have always felt the story needs truly beautiful images to bring it alive.  After a lengthy search, I am super excited and fortunate to have found and partnered up with the amazing artist, Amanda Clark!!! Amanda is an artist and illustrator that creates from her heart and intuition.   She has created many works of incredible art.  You will see!</p>
<p>Amanda is busy working on the images for this book, but here is a taste of some her other work.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><i>What We Need...</i></h2>
</div><div>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Creating<i><strong> A World Worth Imagining</strong></i> continues to be quite an extraordinary adventure.  I love that it exists in the world and that there is this little piece of hope that someone might cling to.  I love that the Forest School kids helped bring it into form, and have come along with me for the ride.  I love that my 13 year old said, when hearing a rather dark doomsday conversation, ""but what if mom's story comes true?""  That's all I want, is to plant a seed of hope.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">With your help,  we can make this happen.</p>

</div><h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2><div>
<p>I think the biggest risk will be not reaching my funding goal.  The reality is, however, that I am totally committed to this project, and so it will happen somehow.  It just might take a little longer.</p>
<p>There is also the risk that something unforeseen will arise in the process that makes it impossible to meet the target distribution date.  I will be sure to keep all supporters in the loop, to try and avoid any disappointment.</p>
<p>The biggest part of this project for me was writing it.  The rest feels a little bit out of my control.  (which sometimes can be challenging for me).  To ensure the production stays consistent with my vision, I will be diligent in communicating clearly and working closely with the folks in whose hands it now lies, and have faith in their expertise.</p>

</div><p> </p></div>","Hi, I am Sue Holloway.  I am a homeschooling mother of two, an entrepreneur, an artist, and an educator.  I have worked with children for over twenty years, the last ten as the founder and teacher of The Forest School - An Alternative Learning Centre in South Gillies, Ontario.  In all that I do, I love to share with others the wonder of what is, and in the case of A World Worth Imagining, the wonder of what could be.
As I mentioned in my video, I'm a believer and I truly believe there is hope for our future and for a world our kids can look forward to.   I also believe, now more than ever, our kids and all of us really, need to be seeing the images and hearing the voices that speak of hope.  And so, I wrote this story.
 
THE INSPIRATION
A World Worth Imagining was inspired by a wonderful group of young people I have taught for many years.  One Earth Day morning standing by our pond, I invited the children to close their eyes and imagine what it might look like in one hundred years.  One of the girls refused, believing that the world would have been destroyed by then.  There was sadness in her eyes as she spoke and I realized then, that our young people understand the crisis facing the planet and its people, that message is coming to them loud and clear.  They hear it, feel it, and they understand the responsibility that comes with it.  What they are not hearing are the voices of visionaries and dreamers, those who can see the possibilities of a new and brighter future. 
On that morning sitting by the pond, I committed to creating a different kind of story for our children, one with a different kind of message -- hope.
And here it is!!!  A World Worth Imagining. 
I have read versions of this story to that same group of kids for the last four Earth Days,  and we all agree, it's ready!  It has been quite the journey so far, but it's not over.   It is time to get it out to the world and to help it be one of those voices that inspires hope in the hearts  of others.
I would love if you helped me make this happen!
 
THE STORY
A World Worth Imagining is seen through the eyes of a young girl in the future reflecting on the beauty of her world.  Seeing all that she has, it is hard for her to imagine the world the elders speak of-- the time when many were driven by fear and self -interest, when the earth was sick from the ways of the people and needed to fight back to reclaim its balance.  She wonders about the bravery and determination it must have taken for her ancestors to forge a new path.  With gratitude, the young girl looks down on her village and sees what becomes in a world guided by respect and compassion.
 
THE ILLUSTRATOR
The search for the perfect illustrator has taken a few years.  I have always felt the story needs truly beautiful images to bring it alive.  After a lengthy search, I am super excited and fortunate to have found and partnered up with the amazing artist, Amanda Clark!!! Amanda is an artist and illustrator that creates from her heart and intuition.   She has created many works of incredible art.  You will see!
Amanda is busy working on the images for this book, but here is a taste of some her other work.

If you want to see more, visit her website: http://earthangelsart.com/. or find her on Facebook --https://www.facebook.com/xamandaclarkx
 
What We Need...

Creating A World Worth Imagining continues to be quite an extraordinary adventure.  I love that it exists in the world and that there is this little piece of hope that someone might cling to.  I love that the Forest School kids helped bring it into form, and have come along with me for the ride.  I love that my 13 year old said, when hearing a rather dark doomsday conversation, ""but what if mom's story comes true?""  That's all I want, is to plant a seed of hope.
With your help,  we can make this happen.
 
My campaign goal of $13,000 will cover the costs of getting the book ready for print.
$1500 editing
$8000 illustrations
$3500 cover and design
Total: $13,000
All monies that are raised will go to seeing this book get out in the world!  If I exceed my goal, the money will be put towards the printing and marketing of A World Worth Imagining.  What You Get...
$5-  A HUGE THANK YOU
$25- 1 Signed copy of the book & a beautifully illustrated bookmark
$50- 2 Signed copies of the book & a beautifully illustrated bookmark
$75.00- 2 Signed copies of the book PLUS one, 8X10 print of the book illustration  of your choice & a beautifully illustrated bookmark
$100.00- 2 Signed copies of the book PLUS two, 8x10 prints of the book illustrations of your choice & a beautifully illustrated bookmark
$150.00- 3 Signed copies of the book, PLUS three, 8X10 prints of the book illustrations of your choice & a beautifully illustrated bookmark
$250- EARTH SPEAKS WORKSHOP for 10 with Sue, PLUS 1 Signed copy of the book.  (other options available for non Thunder Bay residents)
Risks & Challenges
I think the biggest risk will be not reaching my funding goal.  The reality is, however, that I am totally committed to this project, and so it will happen somehow.  It just might take a little longer.
There is also the risk that something unforeseen will arise in the process that makes it impossible to meet the target distribution date.  I will be sure to keep all supporters in the loop, to try and avoid any disappointment.
The biggest part of this project for me was writing it.  The rest feels a little bit out of my control.  (which sometimes can be challenging for me).  To ensure the production stays consistent with my vision, I will be diligent in communicating clearly and working closely with the folks in whose hands it now lies, and have faith in their expertise.
 

Other Ways You Can Help
I would be forever grateful if you would share this campaign with as many friends and contacts as you can.  Every cent is going to help in getting this story published.
Thank you so much!
Sue

<p>James Glencoe was 16 and loved chemistry.  As with nearly all boys who love chemistry, eventually his nose turned to explosives.  He made something called TATP – triacetone triperoxide.</p>
<p>TATP is so powerful and unstable that Islamic terrorists call it “Mother of Satan.”  American high school kids call it fun.  After three days of synthesis, James had created about 20 grams—the weight of about four US quarters—and walked into his parents’ bedroom to show off his creation.</p>
<p>There, in front his mother, father, and girlfriend, his Mother of Satan lived up to its reputation: James blew off his left hand and damaged his right.  The specific cause of the explosion remains a mystery.</p>
<p>Kids today are making explosives like never before.  They are blowing themselves and their friends to pieces with homemade “fireworks.”</p>
<p>A small percentage turn violent and use them to attack.  The 1999 Columbine killers used 95 bombs in their horrific rampage.  Eric Harris, in particular, should have easily been caught in advance.  There is a chance that the Columbine attack would have been interrupted if only there had been a reputable, accurate book available on how to recognize these dangers. <strong>I have written that book. It is entitled <em>The Bomb Boys</em></strong>, and it may help to prevent the next national tragedy—if I can get the funding to produce and distribute it.</p>
<p>High school kids in 2013 are far more advanced at making explosives than those in 1999, regularly making extremely lethal concoctions such as HMTD (which most adults and even Soldiers never have heard of).  The Internet has facilitated a turbo-charge into the learning process.  As for TATP, it has caught on due to the ease of synthesis.  The unpredictability, power, and concealability of this high explosive that looks like table sugar makes gunpowder look tame by comparison.  Yet TATP is just one of many.</p>
<p>So we have these issues to consider:</p>
<p>1) Kids are burning down their homes and blowing themselves and others to pieces, by accident and on purpose.</p>
<p>2) Many victims who are injured physically or economically have no involvement with the activity.  Parents are being charged with felonies and getting successfully sued for their children’s “fireworks” that often cause fatalities.  This can be life-altering for anyone and a career-ender for professionals.</p>
<p>3) Good kids are being convicted of life-changing felonies for more trivial devices, many of which are simple like dry ice, acid, and Drano “bombs.”  None of these contain explosives.   Cases occur daily.  Last week, five boys, aged 13 to 15, were charged with “criminal use of a weapon of mass destruction,” a Class C felony in Kentucky, carrying a possible 5 – 10-year sentence, for a chemical “bomb.”  I have never heard of a fatality from a chemical pressure bomb—a “weapon of mass destruction.”  Yes, fatalities can happen, but “pressure bombs” are far from WMD.  Roman candles are more perilous.</p>
<p>4) Trauma from real explosives is horrific, making gunshot wounds look like bee stings.  James’ mom is suffering PTSD after watching her son blow his hands across the bedroom.  Many victims also suffer PTSD, not to mention blindness, a life without arms, and prison.</p>
<p>5) Community disruptions occur, causing school evacuations and commercial losses.</p>
<p>6) Kids are bringing explosives such as TATP and pipe bombs to school and to parties, often just to show friends.  A golf ball-sized volume of TATP in a pants pocket will blow off a leg.  Last week, a couple of men blew off three of their hands with a small amount of TATP in Australia.</p>
<p>7) Kids who survive bomb accidents are charged with homicide when members in their group are killed, even when the victims were willing participants.  Most injuries occur during play, while others are malicious, such as the recent Australian case wherein teenagers tossed a “golf ball bomb” to a 15-year-old with Asperger’s Syndrome.  The bomb amputated fingers and terribly damaged his hands.</p>
<p>8) Kids are making sensitive high explosives that can pass through nearly all detection.  Future criminals and terrorists will be more potent.  This is a global issue with massive security implications at home and abroad.  We already see it with countless bombs exploding each day.</p>
<p>9) School attacks are common.  The next Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold might kill hundreds of children.  This would be difficult to achieve with firearms, but with current homemade explosives, killing hundreds is possible.</p>

Who:  I'm N.E.

What will happen if we go over and beyond our initial goal of $5,000?  We'd love to put the cash towards an official book launch that EVERY PERSON WHO FINANCIALLY CONTRIBUTED will receive an invite to attend or to one of our favorite charities (depending on overage amount).  Pretty cool, huh?

Take a moment to read the right hand side of this page, where you'll see the amazing donor goodies we put together just for you. Take a look right now and decide which level is right for you.  (Perk awards for donations will be distributed after campaign ends, although certain perks like the limited-edition Cover Art postcards and Shout-outs will be distributed as donations come in.)

<h3>A Little About Me and My Goals</h3>
<p>    I have always loved to travel and plan for it to remain a large part of my life. But I don't want myself to be the only one who benefits from my experiences, I want to share them, allow others to see and learn what travel has shown me, and my best mediums for such sharing are through writing and photography.  For the past couple of months I've been backpacking California and my eyes have really been opened to the vast amount of opportunity I have in front of me.  On April 13th, I turn 21 and it seems a good time to set some new goals and focus my wanderings. Sure, ""everyone"" wants to be a travel writer.  Get paid to see the world and write about it?! What a great far off dream, right?  Maybe not so far off.  While my skills in those areas could use some direction, I can make that happen!  The people who get what they want out of life are the ones who go for it and aren't afraid to ask for help when needed.  That's where you come in.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>    Matador, one of the world's largest online travel communities has created MatadorU, a set of online programs for travel writing, photography, and filmmaking. The course is split into 12 chapters with weekly tests as well as bonus modules with such topics as the art of interviews and personal branding. The program has a lot of positive reviews and the networking opportunities are wonderful.  They really push students to achieve in the field.  There are opportunities of publication throughout the program as well as press trips and even a paid live in writing stint in Belize.  Good incentive to take the classes seriously.  Here's what National Geographic Traveler has to say about MatadorU:</p>
<p><em> “Matador is one of the most important publishing venues we look to find talented new travel writers and photographers.” <strong>- </strong>Keith Bellows, National Geographic Traveler</em></p>
<p><em>   </em> During the program you can follow my work and travels on my Matador travel blog, the link to which I would make available as soon as it gets set up.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Check it out for yourself! <a href=""http://matadoru.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://matadoru.com/</a></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong></p>
<h3><strong>Funds Needed and Contribution Bonuses</strong></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>    The Travel Writing and Photography programs cost $350 each.  However, should I do both I would get $100 off.  So that's $600 for both courses, not too bad a deal, eh?  The main goal is to do both, with the travel writing at the forefront of importance.  Even if I do not reach the goal amount all money raised will go into one or both of the programs. Every little bit counts.</p>
<p>As you are such generous folk and travel is a thing to be shared, I would like to share it with you.  So as a thank you for your contributions you can receive fun gifts like postcards while I travel and photos from my trips.  I want you to be a part of what you are helping make happen.</p>
<h3>Short on Cash?</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>  Me too, thus the fundraiser.  But you can still help out!  Spread the word through social media and IndieGoGo's sharing tools.  Help in any form is appreciated!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><span>My name is Dallas J. Moore.  I have been writing poetry since I was 15 years old.  During the past few years, I've lost a couple of very important people in my life, which helped inspire me to start writing more. I decided to compile the poems I wrote to create a book of my poetry.  I've found a strong passion for writing and want to share it with others.  It has helped me cope with loss and hope that it will speak to others who are also facing life challenges.</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am seeking $2,000, which will help me self publish my first book of poetry, allow me to have sufficient copies printed in order to stock local book stores, create a digital format of the book (kindle, nook, iBook), and pay the artist who helped me with the cover and those who have been kind enough to edit, without promise of compensation. </p>
<p>The goal of this project is to reach a specific goal. Because of that, there is no small piece - any donation and person matters in this. I don't know if I can do it all alone. I want people who help this project feel good about helping me and know that I don't take their time, energy and money lightly. Any donation from anyone is equal in my eyes. </p>
<p>All donations to this campaign will receive a hand written thank you note from me. I feel its very important to express my thanks for your help in this adventure in my life.</p>

</ul>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I have been writing for 14 years. I never thought about making it more than what it was, a way to express myself, and share how I see the world around me. Now, I've realized that it's time to share myself with the world, and to encourage others to share how they feel, what they think, and how they see the world. I want to empower people to have a voice and use writing and poetry as a way to cope with the ups and downs life throws at you. I would love to be a starting place, where someone can relate to how others feel, and to promote the understanding that it's okay to feel whatever you feel. It's also okay to express how you feel, in a positive and productive way, and to create and experience.</p>
<p>I have been involved in raising money and awareness for a <a href=""http://www.childrenscancerconnection.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Children's Cancer Connection</a>  while I was attending college. I also started the <a href=""http://desmoineszombiewalk.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Des Moines Zombie Walk</a> in 2009 to help raise money and awarness for <a href=""http://centraliowashelter.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Central Iowa Shelther &amp; Services</a>, focused on helping the homeless in Des Moines, Iowa. In 2011, I helped found a non-profit, Thongs for Him, to help men battling cancer, after losing my dad in 2010. </p>
<p>I have never asked anyone for anything, even after my wife and I got married in late 2009 and we were both laid off. I started my own business to support us and my wife's dream of going back to school to become a teacher. </p>
<p>I have always found a way. This is a new project and I've become a new person. I know there are others who feel and think the way I do. Maybe you do. I would love to be able to connect with them, share my story, and encourage them to share and write theirs. </p>
<p> </p>

<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't help me fund this project, that's okay. You can share this campaign with your family and friends. You can tell others you know who write poetry, write in a daily journal, or just enjoy reading. You can tell those you know who have experienced loss that I have as well, maybe we would be able to relate with one another. </p>

<li>Feel free to share this campaign with anyone you think would enjoy it.</li>

People like lists, so here's one to explain why DEEP KISS PRESS is like nothing else out there in the world of publishing, and when you've read it you will see that we are unique, authentic, and just may be the future of publishing. (And then you will be so inspired that you'll write us a check to help us grow and flourish!)<br/><br/><strong>WHY DEEP KISS PRESS ROCKS:</strong></p>
<p>1. We're truly alternative. We just don't <em>say</em> we are while secretly wanting to be offered a scrap from the table of the big publishing conglomerates. (Refer to our website to see how badass we are! See below...)<br/><br/> 2. Our books are unlike anything out there. Our covers are works of art and the words inside these covers are real, true, impassioned, and harken back to another era when Literature still existed and mattered, with all of its unpredictability, experimentation, and artistic vision, before the Publishing Industry (some might say dinosaur on the verge of extinction) decided to become an assembly line for bestsellers-soon-to-be-made-into-major-motion-pictures and a purveyor of uniformity.<br/><br/> 3. We celebrate discovering amazing writers and artists and then we help them to make their books as awesome as they can be so we can then put them out into the world, because the world IS a better place with a little more beauty, a little more honesty, a little more artistic integrity in a world of soul-selling and bottom-line driven conformity. What's being offered by mainstream publishing is only that which can be fit into a teeny-tiny hole the size of a pea and we REFUSE to whittle down our enormous log to the size of a toothpick. Instead we take our enormous log and bash the hell out of their teeny-tiny hole!<br/><br/></p>
<p><strong>WHY WE NEED YOUR $$$:</strong><br/><br/> 1. DEEP KISS PRESS is a labor of love by all those involved, but love only goes so far in business, and eventually people need to get paid. Our award-winning design team AMERIKAN HIPSTER (who comes up with our amazing award-winning covers) have so far generously donated their time and talent, as have most of the artists whose work we've used. But we would like to go to the next step. Time is money, and everyone involved have worked untold hours for free or for nominal compensation but we want to reward our amazing collaborators--our artists, cover designers, editors, layout specialists, photographers, and consultants--because they deserve to get paid for their incredible work, and we want to keep them happy and inspire them to even <em>more</em> amazing work! <br/><br/> 2. We'd also like to offer our authors an advance. Right now we give them a box of books but we'd love to include a check in that box as well to make their day and keep the talent happy!<br/><br/> 3. Nuts &amp; bolts. We need more of both. We want to upgrade our computer--maybe even have more than one! We want to upgrade our software. Right now we are renting the Adobe Suite including InDesign and Photoshop on a monthly basis. We'd love to purchase it outright.<br/><br/> 4. Advertising &amp; Social Networking. We would like to hire someone to maintain all of the social networking sites so DEEP KISS PRESS can expand its presence and reach out to everyone. This way we will be able to discover more amazing artists and more people will discover us and buy our books! And we also want to advertise in key publications, but advertising is <em>very</em> expensive, ESPECIALLY for a small business.</p>
<p>So there it is. <br/> And if you need further convincing then go right now to our website and you'll see why we are unlike any place else, and then please offer us your generous support! It isn't often that one can be a part of something that is so full of passion and conviction that it truly inspires. DEEP KISS PRESS is such a place!<br/><br/> Thanks for you consideration.<br/><br/><strong><a href=""http://www.deepkisspress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.deepkisspress.com</a></strong></p></div>","This is Max Perkins, the founder & Grand Poobah of DEEP KISS PRESS, and I'm here to ask for your money.

Our award-winning design team AMERIKAN HIPSTER (who comes up with our amazing award-winning covers) have so far generously donated their time and talent, as have most of the artists whose work we've used. But we would like to go to the next step. Time is money, and everyone involved have worked untold hours for free or for nominal compensation but we want to reward our amazing collaborators--our artists, cover designers, editors, layout specialists, photographers, and consultants--because they deserve to get paid for their incredible work, and we want to keep them happy and inspire them to even more amazing work!  2. We'd also like to offer our authors an advance. Right now we give them a box of books but we'd love to include a check in that box as well to make their day and keep the talent happy! 3. Nuts & bolts. We need more of both. We want to upgrade our computer--maybe even have more than one! We want to upgrade our software. Right now we are renting the Adobe Suite including InDesign and Photoshop on a monthly basis. We'd love to purchase it outright. 4. Advertising & Social Networking. We would like to hire someone to maintain all of the social networking sites so DEEP KISS PRESS can expand its presence and reach out to everyone. This way we will be able to discover more amazing artists and more people will discover us and buy our books! And we also want to advertise in key publications, but advertising is very expensive, ESPECIALLY for a small business.
So there it is.  And if you need further convincing then go right now to our website and you'll see why we are unlike any place else, and then please offer us your generous support! It isn't often that one can be a part of something that is so full of passion and conviction that it truly inspires. DEEP KISS PRESS is such a place!
