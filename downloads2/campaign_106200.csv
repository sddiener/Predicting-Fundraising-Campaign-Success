<p></p>
<p>World³
(World Cubed) is a roguelike RPG in a cube-shaped planet. In this
game you are able explore different cities, dungeons and biomes,
fight against hundreds of enemies, play with 10 unlockable classes
and venture out in search of the center of the planet.</p>
<p>The
planet is made of 6 different faces. Each face has its own
environment: gravity, geography, fauna and flora. 
</p>
<p>The
player has the ability to move between faces by crossing the borders.
To reach the center of the planet you need to pass through holes,
they are hidden in one of the faces and protected by a boss.

</p>
<p>Each
hole moves you to a smaller and deeper level of the planet. Depending
on how far you are in the game, the next level may contain different
biomes as well as harder monsters to face.</p>
<p>The
planets generated are randomized, however it is also possible to use
seeds to generate a replica of another planet, your friend’s for
example, to see who finishes the game faster. The size and the
difficulty of the planet are customizable.</p>

classes to play with: The Knight, The Rogue and The  Wizard. Each of
these classes is expert in one attribute. Those are Strength,
Dexterity and Intelligence, respectively. If you beat the game with
two classes, you unlock a new class, that is the combination of them.
For example, if you won with the Knight and the Rogue, you unlock the
Duelist. The unlocked class inherits attributes from the others two,
but with lower values.<br/>	The last unlockable class is the
Apprentice. The apprentice has no speciality at all, but can learn
any spell in the game.</p><p></p><h3>Actual development stage<br/>

is already in Early Access on Steam! You'll get your game key after the
campaign end at once!Our
campaign is set to Fixed Funding. If we do not get funded, you
will get your money back.BTD’s story
begins in 2117, when fragments of an unknown asteroid fell to Earth. By
studying the trajectory of its flight, scientists were able to determine that
the asteroid came from the Canis Major constellation.

It is a sci-fi universe, which is based on human relationships.


Survival, modifying landscapes and climates.
All the alien worlds, where you have to travel to, have unique physical and natural features. Using the latest technology, modify the planet’s landscape and climate any way you’d like. Your success depends on your ability to adapt to the environment.
Building.Create your own city, build factories and farms to start up a production supply, invite players to join you, seize new land. Your buildings will provide you with protection from the adverse effect of exposure to the environment and enemy aggression, the ability to build and repair equipment, mine and process resources, design and launch mass production, trade and much more. Make your city the center of the universe.







Construction.Use well-known technology to create components of mechanisms and weapons modules from mined resources, and then from the resulting samples, design and assemble unique technology for various purposes to your own individual design.






Assemble and control MRC robots.

In order to achieve local
objectives and colonize new planets, you have the help of MRC (Multi-functional
Robotic Complex) robots, which are capable of working in any conditions, can
bear loads beyond human capacity. You can program the robots, or take them
under your direct control, as well as construct, assemble, improve, and modify
them.











Pets.
In whatever galaxy you find
yourself in, your spirits will be lifted by charming little creatures, who will
travel with you to the edge of the world and defend you unhesitatingly. You
don’t love cute little cats? Then, the robotic Unibots are perfect for you,
though who are you kidding, everyone loves cats.



An exciting storyline campaign.
Try your luck as a conqueror
of distant stellar worlds. Rise through the ranks from candidate in a team of
space settlers to the head of a powerful intergalactic alliance. Set your own
rules and lead in your own policies in the seized territories
The multi-faceted development system.
The game’s character’s
development system is based on a classless skills system which does not
presuppose levels or other statistics parameters. The game world offers
equality from the outset and intuitive character development by way of
completing certain actions, and avoids the need for independent management of
your character and lengthy study of the parameters. You simply do what you like
doing and your character learns alongside you. Alongside developing your
character, you need to remember to upgrade the MRC robots, weapons and
equipment that help you to survive in the harsh conditions on new worlds.
Adventures
with friends.
Mysterious alien worlds are fraught with great danger. But if you’ve got
true friends by your side, any danger can be overcome! Developing planets
together, constructing common bases, launching trade unions, team competitions
with valuable prizes, epic battles, dangerous challenges and other exciting
adventures await all players of BEYOND THE DESTINY!

<b><h3>What TRUST GAME is about and WHY is´t important?<img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>
</h3></b><p></p>
<p>So we create a GAME THAT:</p>
<p>Aims to simulate relationships based on trust; autonomy regarding the economic and financial systems; and cooperation for mutual benefit. These components reflect the give and take dynamic of the game, in which individual success is not related to the failure of others.</p>
<p><b>TRUST was meant to be a board game and perhaps in a near future an App that will allow a simple, fun and educational experience towards economic and financial literacy.</b> We achieve it by creating and sharing simulated resources, namely competences and shared funds, facilitating an efficient learning process that is easily replicable for real life, building trust, skills and the sense of community. These components reflect the give and take dynamic of the game, in which individual success is not related to the failure of others.</p>
<p><b>The game translates the ecosystem where our needs and opportunities occur, as part of our daily life challenges, as well as the options, choices and decisions that often define our well-being. The main goal is to generate shared value and resources through cooperation (individual win/collective win), rather than exploiting resources (individual win/collective loose).</b> </p>
<h3>What We can ACHIEVE WITH YOU?<img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>TRUST is a game that addresses central issues in Europe and worldwide: reducing debt, unemployment and financial exclusion, since it aims to promote skills and values for a sharing and sustainable economy, management and financial literacy, TRUST can play a relevant role as a dynamic learning methodology within the education policy agenda and curricula, replicable in EU Member States, and some parts of the world.</p>
<p>ACAF is bringing together crucial partners to develop this game and its distribution within and outside the country. TRUST can bring many people and organisations to join the social development solutions that ACAF Portugal and similar organisations in the EU and worldwide promote and develop. </p>
<p>With your help we can send TRUST Game to  thousands of communities, build up more and more relationships based on Trust Values, and put different society actors playing in a more collaborative and constructive way. </p>

<p>Reaching the masses through a mainstream board and app game, TRUST aims to improve the players’ financial and management literacy, as well as their competence management skills, and also to improve understanding of how trust and sharing can empower decision-making in an increasingly complex economic and financial system.</p>

</div></div>","What TRUST GAME is about and WHY is´t important?

So we create a GAME THAT:
Aims to simulate relationships based on trust; autonomy regarding the economic and financial systems; and cooperation for mutual benefit. These components reflect the give and take dynamic of the game, in which individual success is not related to the failure of others.
TRUST was meant to be a board game and perhaps in a near future an App that will allow a simple, fun and educational experience towards economic and financial literacy. We achieve it by creating and sharing simulated resources, namely competences and shared funds, facilitating an efficient learning process that is easily replicable for real life, building trust, skills and the sense of community. These components reflect the give and take dynamic of the game, in which individual success is not related to the failure of others.
The game translates the ecosystem where our needs and opportunities occur, as part of our daily life challenges, as well as the options, choices and decisions that often define our well-being. The main goal is to generate shared value and resources through cooperation (individual win/collective win), rather than exploiting resources (individual win/collective loose). 
What We can ACHIEVE WITH YOU?


TRUST is a game that addresses central issues in Europe and worldwide: reducing debt, unemployment and financial exclusion, since it aims to promote skills and values for a sharing and sustainable economy, management and financial literacy, TRUST can play a relevant role as a dynamic learning methodology within the education policy agenda and curricula, replicable in EU Member States, and some parts of the world.
ACAF is bringing together crucial partners to develop this game and its distribution within and outside the country. TRUST can bring many people and organisations to join the social development solutions that ACAF Portugal and similar organisations in the EU and worldwide promote and develop. 
With your help we can send TRUST Game to  thousands of communities, build up more and more relationships based on Trust Values, and put different society actors playing in a more collaborative and constructive way. 
THREE INNOVATIONS OF THE GAME:


Inclusive  - ""color blind people” and “visually impaired people”                 http://www.coloradd.net/


Universal and Timeless game- Trust is a forever an issue no matter what or when.


Win+Win+All Win game

What We Need & What You Get

Why crowdfunding?

To know what people think about every innovative idea or product nothing can be better than SHOW them, ASK them, AND LEARN FROM IT!!!
We want you to imagine the possibility of having the TRUST game in your households, of having the experience of enjoying a completely different approach to board gaming.

Numbers?
We need 2.000 euros to conclude this phase and reach the final prototype;
Counting on your validation in the TRUST GAME’s crowd funding by demanding a game for you will be the step forward to capture investors’ commitment, to attract more fans like you, so we can complete all the phases and produce the game in large scale.

We are very confident that the TRUST game will make the difference:
No longer that to win a game we have to ""Know everything""-Trivial Pursuit
No more ""we need traps and lies to be successful and get the money""- Troika

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>My name is Tristen Hall, I am almost 20 years old, and I am an upstart male Twitch Streamer. I have many vocal talents, including a female voice, Kermit the Frog, and more. It has always been my dream to share my talents of acting and gaming to the world, but sadly, since i am often prone to Epileptic seizures, that often gets in the way of getting things I want to do, done.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am looking for a decent PC to stream with, as well as some gear including a Capture Card for streaming on my Switch and other non-PC  platforms. The PC I have my eyes on is a Amd FM2+ Apu Gpu Radeon R7 Barebones Pc, costing around $289.90 USD with Windows 10 installed, and based on simple Google Searches, Capture Cards ring up around $80 USD. The rest of the money will go towards software and smaller things. </p>
<p>I am not sure entirely what I could give in return, other than better content for those who wish to view my streams. Maybe in the near Future I will add some rewards!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The first and most Obvious risk is this not getting funded, or even noticed by other people. But I will still launch my campaign in hopes that there is a kind soul willing to help out.</p>
<p>Other Risks would include things not getting shipped when I order them, or things breaking on arrival, in which case I can only hope nothing bad happens, for I am not 100% Tech-savvy.</p>

After a year of working on this we are at version 0.9.77A (98% complete)Downloadable from MODDB, you guys can check out how its going.I have spent almost every free minute I get on this, and in desperate need of more time for this.I'm sure you are a eager as I am to dive into the star wars universe and build your own empire or defeat one.many thanks :)",0.0,0,"7 Campaigns

<p><span lang=""EN-US"">A good kart game - the kind that you always love to play, that tempts you with a quick race against friends even years after you bought it - is always a balanced mix of four different ingredients: speed, simplicity, competition, mayhem. If it has these four things in the right proportion, then it's basically endless fun. </span></p>
<p><span lang=""EN-US"">With <strong>Fable Kart</strong> we want to get this magic cocktail really precisely right. </span></p>
<p><strong><span lang=""EN-US"">Old and New</span></strong></p>
<p><span lang=""EN-US"">We are currently developing the game for <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">PC</span>, and we are hoping to convert it at least for <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Android</span>. If the fundraising goes very well, we want to convert it for iOS devices too.</span></p>
<p><span lang=""EN-US"">In many ways, <strong>Fable Kart</strong> is a traditional title, because, like they say, we are all dwarves standing on the shoulders of giants. So the gameplay has many of the elements you would expect: it's easy to jump into a quick race, it's very fast, there are bonuses and boosts to pick up on the track, you can interact with other players, slow them down etc. All the classic things you usually do in a game of karts. We are working hard to place them properly and tune them, so there is never a dull moment during the race. </span></p>

<p><span lang=""EN-US"">So we actually scrapped the single player entirely. The game is only multiplayer.

<p><span lang=""EN-US"">In terms of interactions between different karts, the idea was that they should create proper mayhem, and foster even more the competition.

<p>What is the single thing that a multiplayer-only kart game really needs in order to be properly fun? Why, a big community, of course. And that’s where the IndieGoGo campaign becomes important. Basically, our campaign is set with the idea of building the community before the game is released, since almost all the perks include one, or more, or many copies of the game.</p>
<p>In short: if you contribute with at least five euros AND we reach our objective, not only you will have a copy of the game, but you will also be sure that there will be a good number of people with the same game, ready to play with you - sort of a pre-built community.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if we don’t reach the objective, you will get your money back, since the campaign is set on fixed. So you can’t go wrong with your contributions, really:)</p>
<p>Plus, the more people contribute, the more content will be present in the game, the more polished will be the whole thing and the bigger will be the community. The steps we have set are these:</p>
<p><strong>50.000 euros-&gt;The game is completed!</strong></p>
<p><strong>65.000 euros-&gt;The game is completed with additional content: extra tracks, extra characters.</strong></p>
<p><strong>80.000 euros-&gt;The game is completed with more additional content: tracks, characters, game modes.</strong></p>
<p><strong>100.000 euros-&gt;The game is completed with all the extra stuff and is converted to Android.</strong></p>
<p>We actually want to convert the game even if we don’t reach the 100k mark; but in that case it will definitely take more time. We should also mention that we are always open to suggestions and discussions, so feel free to contact us via our website and throw on the table your ideas on how the perfect kart game should be!</p>

If it has these four things in the right proportion, then it's basically endless fun. 
With Fable Kart we want to get this magic cocktail really precisely right. 
Old and New
We are currently developing the game for PC, and we are hoping to convert it at least for Android. If the fundraising goes very well, we want to convert it for iOS devices too.
In many ways, Fable Kart is a traditional title, because, like they say, we are all dwarves standing on the shoulders of giants. So the gameplay has many of the elements you would expect: it's easy to jump into a quick race, it's very fast, there are bonuses and boosts to pick up on the track, you can interact with other players, slow them down etc. All the classic things you usually do in a game of karts. We are working hard to place them properly and tune them, so there is never a dull moment during the race. 
                         
                   
 
But we are also adding quite some new stuff that we hope you will find interesting. 
The first area we focused on is the multiplayer - and that should go without saying, because kart games are all about multiplayer, single player is usually not very interesting. In fact, single player is usually more of a chore than anything else, something that you have to go through in order to unlock something.

As for how actual races works, here is where things should get interesting: we have a few ideas that will spice up things nicely and separate Fable Kart from past titles. However we don't want to disclose them just yet, partly because they are many and we are still checking what works and what doesn't, and to be honest also because we really like these ideas, we think they are actually innovative, and it's too soon to tell everything:).

<p>Wind Traveler is a project that we have been developing for the past two years for pure passion and will to finish our first complete game. It was greenlit on Steam by the end of 2016.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531957428/dqgo8nvmcoztvuq5bfyn.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Over the development process, we had the opportunity to expose the game in a few indie events and we hoped that we would find a partner or a publisher to help us finish this project. Although none of our contacts ended in a successful negotiation, the audience reception on the events were great, there were lots of good feedback and high interest in the game.</p>
<p>We believe in our game potential and hope that you, the players, can help us finish it.</p>

<p>Over these two years, we invested all the time and money we had on the game development. Also, several people voluntarily helped us through some parts of the game. However, there are some characteristics of the project that we want to add, as well as polish the content already created, and for that we need a little push. That is why we created this IndieGoGo campaign.</p>
<p>We already have 80% of all game features ready. At the moment, we are working on adding more content, polishing features and bug solving. The fund raised here will allow us to finish the missing features (like the class progression and bosses) and invest in creating better sound effects, music, localization, animation, light effects, and a better artificial intelligence for the enemies and NPCs.</p>

Wind Traveler is a project that we have been developing for the past two years for pure passion and will to finish our first complete game. It was greenlit on Steam by the end of 2016.

Over the development process, we had the opportunity to expose the game in a few indie events and we hoped that we would find a partner or a publisher to help us finish this project. Although none of our contacts ended in a successful negotiation, the audience reception on the events were great, there were lots of good feedback and high interest in the game.
We believe in our game potential and hope that you, the players, can help us finish it.
 
Budget

Over these two years, we invested all the time and money we had on the game development. Also, several people voluntarily helped us through some parts of the game. However, there are some characteristics of the project that we want to add, as well as polish the content already created, and for that we need a little push. That is why we created this IndieGoGo campaign.
We already have 80% of all game features ready. At the moment, we are working on adding more content, polishing features and bug solving. The fund raised here will allow us to finish the missing features (like the class progression and bosses) and invest in creating better sound effects, music, localization, animation, light effects, and a better artificial intelligence for the enemies and NPCs.
 

 

 


 
Walk around the city of Formene, meet the villagers, and explore the ruin's open portals. But beware! When you least expect, you may stumble upon a dangerously cute monster!
 
Squirrels may be as cute as cruel. So be careful when wandering around their caves.
 
Battle

In Wind Traveler, there is an Active Turn Based Battle System, that means the enemies are not going to wait for your turn to attack. You may attack, use items and skills during the battle. 
 
Gather and Craft

Collect ores, herbs, ingredients and materials from the enemies to forge your equipment.
Craft potions, dishes and tools to help you face stronger enemies.
 
Classes

 

 
 
At the start of the game, you may choose between Adventurer or Student. As the game progresses, you will be able to choose between advanced classes by finding secret books around the world. Gwendolyn will help you decipher them at the library.
 
Relationship

As you play, you will get to know the NPCs, and eventually learn about their past story. Aside from winning your beloved heart, you will also get bonuses for every friendship you have when going on adventures.
 
NPCs

NPCs around the village will give you quests with rewards like items to help you progress in the game.
 


 
Here are the bachelors and bachelorettes that you will meet in Yrunia;

<p>Damned is a randomized online horror game for up to <strong>5 players</strong> (<strong>4 survivors</strong> and <strong>1 monster</strong>).</p>
<p>You’ll be able to play as one of the four people that got trapped inside this haunted hotel.</p>
<p>As a survivor your main objective will be finding your way out, as well as helping your fellows get out too. You’ll often find yourself on the edge, hearing and seeing ghostly things, trying to find keys and items to help in your escape. And sometimes you’ll find yourself running desperately from a monster, who’s there only to hunt down and kill you and your friends.</p>
<p>You’ll also be able to play as the monster. You’ll assume an ethereal form, which you’ll use to haunt the survivors, triggering eerie noises and events. You’ll also assume a physical form, which will allow you to hunt and kill the survivors trapped in the hotel. It’ll be your killing spree.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Our initial idea is to develop:</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir=""ltr"">4 different survivors (the players will be able to choose which one they want to play with);</li>
<li class=""_mce_tagged_br"" dir=""ltr""><span>1 monster, with a very unique set of skills, abilities and mechanics;</span></li>
<li class=""_mce_tagged_br"" dir=""ltr""><span>The entire first floor;</span></li>
<li class=""_mce_tagged_br"" dir=""ltr""><span>1 game mode (4 survivors x monster).</span></li>
</ul><p><strong id=""docs-internal-guid-22b21d88-3de0-36c0-8279-c58838780198""></strong>But if we reach certain amounts of money, we'll be able to keep working on Damned, in order to deliver an even better game. In this case we plan on adding new survivors, new monsters (each one carefuly designed to keep the gaming experience really scary), entire new floors (cellars, upper floors, etc) and new game modes.</p>
<p><img alt=""Stretch Goals"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/229550/Indiegogo/Stretch%20Goals.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Stretch Goals""/></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><img alt=""What kind of Horror?"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/229550/Indiegogo/what%20kind%20of%20horror%20game.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""What kind of Horror?""/></p>
<p>Damned explores the sense of being defenseless against a powerful supernatural force. The survivors can’t directly affect the monster in any way. When it’s there to get you, your only chance is to run and hide.</p>
<p>This perception of being defenseless is very strong, primal and terrifying, it builds up anxiety and makes you really scared, fearing any unexplained noise or movement.</p>
<p>This is how Damned creates horror in a multiplayer game, and we believe it to be super effective! (tested and approved!)</p>
<p><img alt=""Where takes place?"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/229550/Indiegogo/were%20take%20place.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Where takes place?""/></p>
<p>Damned takes place in a haunted hotel, abandoned in the 1920’s. This hotel was home to some gruesome murders in the past, which led people to abandon it, leaving this eerie building open to those who want to prove that ghosts doesn't exist (or that they do exist).</p>
<p>We plan on releasing a quarter of the first floor, fully playable, in the alpha version. And then, keep working to add the remaining parts, in order to feature an entire floor in our first non-alpha release. After that, and depending on the stretch goals we reach, we plan on creating more playable floors, adding new stages to the game. </p>
<p><img alt=""Maps"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/229550/Indiegogo/maps.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Maps""/></p>
<p><img alt=""Why is randomized?"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/229550/Indiegogo/why%20randomized.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Why is randomized?""/></p>
<p>Every stage in Damned is randomized:</p>
<ul>
<li>Almost all the objects in a stage may or may not appear;</li>
<li>The item system is fully random too, randomizing which item will appear in the game, and where it'll be;</li>
<li>The final objective as a survivor is also randomized, so in one gameplay you may have to power up the elevator and take it, in another gameplay (at the same stage), you may have to unlock the door leading to the upper floors, in a third gameplay your only way out may be going downstairs into the basement;</li>
<li>The haunted hotel may also trigger a lot of random events to scare the survivors inside, like doors slamming, sounds of ghosts and ghostly objects.</li>
</ul><p>In another words, Damned is a randomized game because its stages, events, items and objects are randomized.</p>
<p><img alt=""Why is Damned competitive/coop?"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/229550/Indiegogo/why%20competitive.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Why is Damned competitive/coop?""/></p>
<p>Because in a full game, with 4 survivors and 1 monster, there’ll be a survivor “team” cooperating to try and escape together, and at the same time they’ll be competing against a monster, trying to avoid its traps and trying to flee from him and deny each one of its attempt to hunt and kill a survivor.</p>
<p><img alt=""SS01"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/229550/Indiegogo/Damned_ss06.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""SS01""/></p>

<p>As a survivor you’ll be cooperating with your friends (up to 4 survivors in a single game session):</p>
<ul>
<li>You and your friends will be searching the hotel for keys and items to help in your escape;</li>
<li>Each survivor will have a flashlight that can be turned on and off, helping you see your surroundings, but at the same time letting the monster know where you are;</li>
<li>The survivors will be able to manipulate objects throughout the hotel, like drawers, doors, safes, cabinets, wardrobes;</li>
<li>When the monster is in its ethereal form, a survivor isn’t capable of viewing or noticing it, but the monster can still haunt them. So when I survivor hears a haunting sound coming from, let’s say, the kitchen, it’s better to avoid and try to go around it, because the monster is probably there;</li>
<li>When a survivor sees the monster, it means that the monster can probably see you, and that it can kill you. Your only choice is to turn around and run like hell.</li>
</ul><p><img alt=""Howto monster?"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/229550/Indiegogo/How%20to%20play%20as%20the%20monster.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Howto monster?""/></p>
<p>As the monster, your game will be all about competing alone against the survivors team.</p>
<p>You’ll start in your ethereal form, where you can pass through doors and see clearly the environment around. While in the ethereal form, you won’t be able to see the survivors (you’re in another plane of existence), but you’ll still be able to trigger events to haunt them, like making the piano play by itself, creating random haunting noises like footsteps, or making the clock strike the twelve beats really loud.</p>
<p>Then, after regaining your powers, you’ll be able to assume your physical form. This makes you able to use supernatural powers, see the survivors, their flashlights, and the mess they left when they passed by, hear their footsteps and noises, and most importantly, kill them to satisfy your need for blood. But you gotta be quick about it, because your physical form is tiresome and consumes your power quickly, forcing you into the ethereal state when it depletes.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">We don’t have a date yet, but it’ll probably be available in 2 months (about June, 2013).</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><img alt=""Why do we need funding?"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/229550/Indiegogo/why%20need%20founding.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Why do we need funding?""/></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>When we started 9heads Game Studios (our company), we had this idea of making a pilot project, that would put our team to the test. This project ultimately delivered Vitrum, a 3D puzzler we released last year. Vitrum was mainly developed in our free time. Including bundles participations, it sold more than 3500 copies. But in the end of the day, it gave us no money at all. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>But even so, we decided to quit our jobs and work full time on the development of a more ambicious game, focused on a specific target audience and featuring a lot of modern technologies. Since August, 2012, we are living out of our personal savings, working full time, and we’re almost getting to a point where we'll be able to release an alpha version.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Everything we used so far was absolutely free, every programming library, every content, sound effects, sound tracks, etc. And we already achieved an impressive quality. So, imagine what we'd do if we had enough money to actually invest in the game... We’d do everything!</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">With money, we'd be able to hire people, like composers, 3d artists, programmers. We’d put some money into digital content, like 3d models, textures, sounds. We’d properly publicize the game. And depending on the amount of money raised, we’d be able to stretch our goals, making Damned even bigger and better, adding monsters with different characteristics, powers, hunting techniques and mechanics; adding characters and stages; building more random events and adding more objects for the survivors and the monster to interact with.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Most importantly, we’d be able to deliver an excellent horror game. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">So, the answer to this question is: We need funding because we really need the money to keep working on Damned. The money we had from our previous jobs is ending and we got to pay our bills too. So, if you like our project, your help is REALLY (i can't stress this enough) important to make it happen.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span>Because it’s fun!</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>It’s really scary, you’ll find yourself on the edge a lot of times, trying to evade the monster or trying to pay closer attention because you don’t know if the sound you just heard is some random noise or if it is the monster haunting you.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>It’s a real horror game, it explores deeply the feeling of being completely defenseless against a powerful force that can finish you easily. Your only choice is to run and hide!</span></p>

“What sounds really cool...is the stuff you can do while playing the monster.” -Kotaku.com “...Damned has a unique premise...” -Eurogamer.com “...team up as the hunted or become the hunter...” -Polygon.com “...una versión extrema de Pac-Man...” -LevelUp.com

Damned is a randomized online horror game for up to 5 players (4 survivors and 1 monster).
You’ll be able to play as one of the four people that got trapped inside this haunted hotel.
As a survivor your main objective will be finding your way out, as well as helping your fellows get out too. You’ll often find yourself on the edge, hearing and seeing ghostly things, trying to find keys and items to help in your escape. And sometimes you’ll find yourself running desperately from a monster, who’s there only to hunt down and kill you and your friends.
You’ll also be able to play as the monster. You’ll assume an ethereal form, which you’ll use to haunt the survivors, triggering eerie noises and events. You’ll also assume a physical form, which will allow you to hunt and kill the survivors trapped in the hotel. It’ll be your killing spree.
Our initial idea is to develop:

4 different survivors (the players will be able to choose which one they want to play with);
1 monster, with a very unique set of skills, abilities and mechanics;
The entire first floor;
1 game mode (4 survivors x monster).
But if we reach certain amounts of money, we'll be able to keep working on Damned, in order to deliver an even better game. In this case we plan on adding new survivors, new monsters (each one carefuly designed to keep the gaming experience really scary), entire new floors (cellars, upper floors, etc) and new game modes.


Damned explores the sense of being defenseless against a powerful supernatural force. The survivors can’t directly affect the monster in any way. When it’s there to get you, your only chance is to run and hide.
This perception of being defenseless is very strong, primal and terrifying, it builds up anxiety and makes you really scared, fearing any unexplained noise or movement.
This is how Damned creates horror in a multiplayer game, and we believe it to be super effective! (tested and approved!)

Damned takes place in a haunted hotel, abandoned in the 1920’s. This hotel was home to some gruesome murders in the past, which led people to abandon it, leaving this eerie building open to those who want to prove that ghosts doesn't exist (or that they do exist).
We plan on releasing a quarter of the first floor, fully playable, in the alpha version. And then, keep working to add the remaining parts, in order to feature an entire floor in our first non-alpha release. After that, and depending on the stretch goals we reach, we plan on creating more playable floors, adding new stages to the game. 


Every stage in Damned is randomized:

Almost all the objects in a stage may or may not appear;
The item system is fully random too, randomizing which item will appear in the game, and where it'll be;
The final objective as a survivor is also randomized, so in one gameplay you may have to power up the elevator and take it, in another gameplay (at the same stage), you may have to unlock the door leading to the upper floors, in a third gameplay your only way out may be going downstairs into the basement;
The haunted hotel may also trigger a lot of random events to scare the survivors inside, like doors slamming, sounds of ghosts and ghostly objects.
In another words, Damned is a randomized game because its stages, events, items and objects are randomized.

Because in a full game, with 4 survivors and 1 monster, there’ll be a survivor “team” cooperating to try and escape together, and at the same time they’ll be competing against a monster, trying to avoid its traps and trying to flee from him and deny each one of its attempt to hunt and kill a survivor.


As a survivor you’ll be cooperating with your friends (up to 4 survivors in a single game session):

You and your friends will be searching the hotel for keys and items to help in your escape;
Each survivor will have a flashlight that can be turned on and off, helping you see your surroundings, but at the same time letting the monster know where you are;
The survivors will be able to manipulate objects throughout the hotel, like drawers, doors, safes, cabinets, wardrobes;
When the monster is in its ethereal form, a survivor isn’t capable of viewing or noticing it, but the monster can still haunt them. So when I survivor hears a haunting sound coming from, let’s say, the kitchen, it’s better to avoid and try to go around it, because the monster is probably there;
When a survivor sees the monster, it means that the monster can probably see you, and that it can kill you. Your only choice is to turn around and run like hell.

As the monster, your game will be all about competing alone against the survivors team.
You’ll start in your ethereal form, where you can pass through doors and see clearly the environment around. While in the ethereal form, you won’t be able to see the survivors (you’re in another plane of existence), but you’ll still be able to trigger events to haunt them, like making the piano play by itself, creating random haunting noises like footsteps, or making the clock strike the twelve beats really loud.
Then, after regaining your powers, you’ll be able to assume your physical form. This makes you able to use supernatural powers, see the survivors, their flashlights, and the mess they left when they passed by, hear their footsteps and noises, and most importantly, kill them to satisfy your need for blood. But you gotta be quick about it, because your physical form is tiresome and consumes your power quickly, forcing you into the ethereal state when it depletes.


As soon as we release the alpha version on Desura we’ll send you your game key and you’ll be able to play it.

We don’t have a date yet, but it’ll probably be available in 2 months (about June, 2013).

When we started 9heads Game Studios (our company), we had this idea of making a pilot project, that would put our team to the test. This project ultimately delivered Vitrum, a 3D puzzler we released last year. Vitrum was mainly developed in our free time. Including bundles participations, it sold more than 3500 copies. But in the end of the day, it gave us no money at all. 
But even so, we decided to quit our jobs and work full time on the development of a more ambicious game, focused on a specific target audience and featuring a lot of modern technologies. Since August, 2012, we are living out of our personal savings, working full time, and we’re almost getting to a point where we'll be able to release an alpha version.
Everything we used so far was absolutely free, every programming library, every content, sound effects, sound tracks, etc. And we already achieved an impressive quality. So, imagine what we'd do if we had enough money to actually invest in the game... We’d do everything!
With money, we'd be able to hire people, like composers, 3d artists, programmers. We’d put some money into digital content, like 3d models, textures, sounds. We’d properly publicize the game. And depending on the amount of money raised, we’d be able to stretch our goals, making Damned even bigger and better, adding monsters with different characteristics, powers, hunting techniques and mechanics; adding characters and stages; building more random events and adding more objects for the survivors and the monster to interact with.
Most importantly, we’d be able to deliver an excellent horror game. 
So, the answer to this question is: We need funding because we really need the money to keep working on Damned. The money we had from our previous jobs is ending and we got to pay our bills too. So, if you like our project, your help is REALLY (i can't stress this enough) important to make it happen.


Because it’s fun!
It’s really scary, you’ll find yourself on the edge a lot of times, trying to evade the monster or trying to pay closer attention because you don’t know if the sound you just heard is some random noise or if it is the monster haunting you.
It’s a real horror game, it explores deeply the feeling of being completely defenseless against a powerful force that can finish you easily. Your only choice is to run and hide!
And also because it’s really fun to play as the monster as well. You’ll keep haunting and building up anxiety in people, making them terribly scared of you. Then you’ll assume your physical form and hunt them down. We really put you in the skin of a classical horror movie monster.

We are using only free content (mainly licensed by creative commons), and things we built upon other free stuff, like our own game engine, called 9gears. 
9gears is our proprietary game engine. It allows us to create a game with extremely low budget, since we only need to pay our own work (and even this we aren’t paying at the moment), and in the future, expenses regarding an office rental, etc.

Mirliton was founded in 1983 turning an hobby of the owner and sculptor Stefano Grazzini in a real job.The activity began with a series of Napoleonic ranges and then expanded to the ancient eras. Then came the time of the Middle Ages, the true passion of Stefano. Following behind requests of the same clients and following a program, the series has expanded to the Renaissance, the Italian wars of independence, and the Second World War. Mirliton is known worldwide among the players of wargames, collectors and enthusiasts of military history. He now has a very large catalog of miniatures, accessories, books on military history and everything that can serve the passionate collector as the veteran player alike. In 2003 there was a turning point, Mirliton had the opportunity to buy the production of the Grenadier Models and all the master molds with the related rights of thousands of fantasy miniatures including those related to the game Fantasy Warriors. This allowed the business to embark in the fantasy market an with great success too.
Mirliton wants to be able to release again all of the game lines of the glorious Grenadier company, a game series still followed by many fans.Now in 2013, then 30 years after the founding of the company and 10 years after the acquisition of the Grenadier, Mirliton has decided to make a gift to its many customers reissuing, with new graphics, arts and updated rules, the beautiful 3D wargame Fantasy Warriors.

 
Crowdfunding is today very popular, it is a great way to find the necessary funds and resources to give a classic and powerful game like Fantasy Warriors the revamping treatment that it deserves.In a competitive worldwide market like the global one we live with, there is no place for sub-standard arts or rulebook presentation. 
Contributors to this campaign will have the opportunity to see again a great classic of the fantasy wargame world having a new life, helping us in bringing the game to new heights where the old Grenadier never had time to reach.
This campaign will drive forward the game to develop the well-proven mechanics of Fantasy Warriors into new terrains, new rules for naval and seaside battles, sieges, fortifications, city fight and more ideas we are testing yet to see what we can add to this wonderful ruleset.
A real background world will be fully developed, with maps, cultures and tens of races, something the old Grenadier never did in details.
If this campaign will meet success. future is going to see new armies, beasts, wondrous vehicles and buildings.
Without the resources that only you, thanks to this campaign, can give us goals like these are very difficult to be reached.
Help us to make Fantasy Warriors a reality again, and help us to make it better, brightful and even more exciting than before!

<h3>Distribution Strategy</h3>
<div>We will not work with big distribution companies. We will not expose commercials inside the game repeatedly to deceive users. It is also the opportunity together with the huge distributor, but also poison. Even though heir support can be effective, they have to take commission is large enough to seem unfair as part of start-up companies. Our goal is to distribute the game into many languages and many countries by ourselves. If we check the possibility at any one country, then we are willing to do with the distributor. The funding target is $200,000 dollars. The Korean and English version will be launched in first quarter, 2016. Extra $10,000 added will bring one more language version of the game. Japanese, Chinese, German, Spanish, French, Arabic, Russian, Portuguese, Italian, Turkish </div>

<br/><h3>게임소개</h3>
<div>
<p>어느날 갑자기 마왕은 죽기로 결심했다. 하지만 스스로 목숨을 끊을 수도 없을 뿐 아니라, 마계에서는 마왕을 죽일 수 있는 생명체는 아무도 없었다. 결국 마왕은 잠재력이 강한 인간 용사들을 단련시켜 본인을 죽일 수 있도록 하는 비밀 계획을 시행에 옮기는데! 마왕은 대체 왜 이러는 걸까? 그리고 무사히 원하는 바를 이룰 수 있을까?</p>
<div>
<h3>기획의도</h3>
<p>안녕하세요. 세상을 즐겁게 만들려고 매일같이 애쓰는 whed입니다. 근래에 출시되는 모바일 게임들은 대부분 비슷한 설정으로 진행됩니다.</p>
<p>1)유저는 용사를 조종해서 단지 레벨업 하기 위해 몬스터들과 싸움을 계속합니다.(요즘은 조종도 안하고 자동으로 싸우죠.)</p>
<p>2)유저는 용사를 레벨업 시키면서 어떻게 키울지 고심하지만, 고민이 무색하게 결국 '국민테크트리'를 따라 모두 똑같은 방향으로 성장시키게 됩니다.(결국에는 고민도 안하게 되지요.) </p>
<p>3)재밌게 게임을 하다 어느 순간 현금을 쓰지 않으면 더 이상 진행을 못할만큼 어려워져서 포기하게 됩니다.(게임 회사도 먹고 살아야겠지만 좀 심하잖아요.)</p>
<p>우리는 이런 모바일 게임들에 완전히 질려 버렸습니다. 모두 껍데기만 다른 예쁘기만할 뿐인 게임들에 말이죠. 그래서 우리는 이 세상에 없는 장르의 게임을 만들기로 했습니다. 우리의 일상은 ""기존 방식과 다르면서 재미있는 게임을 만들고 싶다""는 고민의 연속이었습니다. 고민할 필요 없는 것들은 과감히 생략하고 재미있는 요소만을 남겨놓기로 했습니다. 그 길고 긴 인고의 시간을 보내고, 드디어 야심작 ""마왕 죽기로 결심하다""를 만들게 됐습니다.</p>
<h3>장르</h3>""게임에서 이기기 위해서는 적이 강해지도록 키워 주어야 한다""는 설정은 저희가 아는 바로는 기존에 찾아볼 수 없는 장르입니다. 그래서 우리는 이 새로운 게임의 장르를 ""feeding "" 혹은 ""츤데레""라고 부릅니다.<p>*Feeding : 적에게 고의로 죽어 적을 강하게 만드는게 목적적인 게임입니다.</p>
<p>*츤데레 (ツンデレ) : 재패니메이션이나 일본의 미소녀 게임에서 찾아볼 수 있는 등장인물의 인격 유형 가운데 하나를 일컫는 유행어입니다. 이 말은 ‘새침하고 퉁명스러운 모습’을 나타내는 일본어 의태어인 츤츤(つんつん )과 ‘부끄러워하는 것’을 나타내는 일본어 의태어 데레데레(でれでれ)의 합성어입니다. 즉, '츤데레 게임'은 퉁명스럽게 적과 싸우는 듯 보이지만, 사실은 적이 더 강해지도록 노력해야 하는 게임입니다.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>플랫폼</h3>현재 계획으로는 iOS와 안드로이드를 지원합니다.<p></p>
<h3>아트 컨셉</h3>
<p>*용사들</p>
<p>용사라는 이름을 달기에는 과할만큼 귀엽고 명랑한 모습을 하고 있습니다. 어딘가 하나씩 부족해 보여서 유저들의 보호본능을 자극 하기에 부족함이 없어서 한껏 성장시키고 싶은 마음이 들게 하는 디자인입니다.</p>
<p>*몬스터</p>
<p>기괴하지만 미워할 수 없는 몬스터들입니다. 영문도 모른채 용사들과 싸워야 하고 마왕의 계획 때문인 것도 모른채 열심히 노력해도 늘 용사에게 패배하는 모습이 안 쓰럽기도 합니다.</p>
<div>*타이틀<p>용사들과 몬스터가 전반적으로 귀엽다면 타이틀은 진지하고 싶었습니다. 어이없는 설정과 귀여운 캐릭터와 다르게 우리가 매우 진지하게 이 게임을 만들고 있다는 것을 보여줍니다.</p>
</div>
<br/><h3>게임룰</h3>
<p>유저는 마왕의 입장이 되어 몬스터를 출전 시킵니다. 용사는 조정할 수 없습니다. 주인공은 용사인데도 말이죠. 용사는 자동으로 몬스터와 싸우고, 이기면 자동으로 성장합니다. 유저는 용사의 파라메터에 신경 쓸게 전혀 없어요. 허약한 용사가 죽지 않고 무럭무럭 강해질 수 있도록 적절한 조합으로 몬스터를 출전시켜야 합니다. 용사가 몬스터와 싸워서 모두 죽으면 실패합니다. 어찌됐든 용사들이 죽지 않도록 몬스터들을 먹여 줘야 합니다. 무럭 무럭 강해진 용사가 무사히 마왕을 무찌를 수 있도록 기도하세요.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>배급전략</h3>
<p></p>
<p>우리는 강력한 퍼블리셔와 손을 잡지도 않을 것이고, 반복적인 게임 내 광고 노출로 유저를 현혹하지도 않으려고 합니다. 퍼블리셔가 제공하는 막강한 지원은 달콤하지만, 퍼블리셔에게만 유리한 계약 조건들은 스타트업이 감내하기에는 너무나 큰 위험이 되기도 합니다. 우리는 스스로의 힘으로 최대한 많은 언어로 최대한 많은 나라에 출시할 계획입니다. 우리가 출시한 여러 나라중에 어느 한 곳에서라도 '마왕 죽기로 결심하다'가 가능성을 보인다면 그때에 퍼블리셔와 계약해도 늦지 않을 것이라 생각합니다. 펀딩 목표액은 20만 달러 입니다. 한국어와 영어로 2016년 1Q에 출시할 예정입니다. 추가 1만 달러마다 일어, 중국어, 독어, 스페인어, 프랑스어, 아랍어, 러시아어, 포르투칼어, 이탈리아어, 터키어다음 순서대로 언어를 하나씩 추가할 예정입니다.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>회사소개</h3>안녕하세요 '웨드'입니다. 저희는 '널리 사람을 즐겁게 하라'는 목표를 갖고 만들어진 회사입니다. 그 첫걸음으로 게임 개발을 시작합니다. 우리가 생각할 때 게임에서 가장 중요한 경쟁력은 '기획력'입니다. 그래서 우리의 직원들중 반은 기획자들입니다. 앞으로 회사가 커지더라도 기획자들 중심의 조직으로 만들어나갈 계획입니다.</div>

And can he fulfill his wish?<The heroes are cute and bright unlike their names.>Development StoryHi! We are ""whed"", the company working to make this world funnier and happier everyday.The mobile games that has been released these days are all quite similar. All of them has different shapes with same type of rules and goals.
The user controls heroes while playing the game. But the purpose of the game becomes to train heroes into a higher level then to enjoy the game itself.(These days the users do not control and just watch the heroes fight automatically)
The user will consider how to level-up heroes, but no matter how hard they try, heroes will be developed as same as others.(Therefore, no need to worry)
Even though the user plays the game well enough, they will give up at the point where they have to use their own money to continue the game.
We are tired of the mobile games pouring out everyday. That's why we decided to make a whole new type of game that never existed in this world. Everyday we thought about 'making a game different from the others'. We decided to cut out all useless elements and leave only the fun elements. After a long time of discussion and consideration, we decided to make the game 'Devil Decides to Die'.Genre The game setting rule 'The enemy has to be raised as to be stronger to win the game' is different from other games. So we call this new type of game 'feeding' or 'tsundere'. *Feeding : giving food behavior of others to grow *Tsundere : (ツンデレ, [tsɯndeɽe]) is a Japanese character development process that describes a person who is initially cold and even hostile towards another person before gradually showing their warm side over time. The word is derived from the terms tsun tsun (ツンツン), meaning to turn away in disgust, and dere dere (デレデレ) meaning to become 'lovey dovey'.<Monsters looks strange but cute at the same time. They have to fight with the heroes without knowing why they are fighting, what the Devil's intention is and most of all fail during fighting with the heroes.>PlatformWe will release iOS & Android at the moment.


Game Rules


The user becomes the Devil and participate monsters in the game. The heroes cannot be controlled. Even though the main character of the game is the heroes. The heroes fight with monsters automatically, and also grow while fighting.


The user does not have to care about the heroes' ability. When monsters drop items and skills, the heroes get them.

The heroes use the items and skills to fight monsters, also automatically.

The user has to send out various types of monsters in order not to kill the weak the heroes. You will lose the game if the heroes all die. The user shall feed the heroes with monsters properly so that the heroes level up and survive.

Pray for the heroes to become stronger and stronger to kill the Devil.

Distribution Strategy
We will not work with big distribution companies. We will not expose commercials inside the game repeatedly to deceive users. It is also the opportunity together with the huge distributor, but also poison. Even though heir support can be effective, they have to take commission is large enough to seem unfair as part of start-up companies. Our goal is to distribute the game into many languages and many countries by ourselves. If we check the possibility at any one country, then we are willing to do with the distributor. The funding target is $200,000 dollars. The Korean and English version will be launched in first quarter, 2016. Extra $10,000 added will bring one more language version of the game. Japanese, Chinese, German, Spanish, French, Arabic, Russian, Portuguese, Italian, Turkish 


About whedwhed is the start-up company who wants to make people fun everyday. The first step of whed is making games. In our opinion the most competitiveness of game is 'Directing'. That's why half of our people 'Directors'. whed runs development sector through outsourcing.

게임소개

어느날 갑자기 마왕은 죽기로 결심했다. 하지만 스스로 목숨을 끊을 수도 없을 뿐 아니라, 마계에서는 마왕을 죽일 수 있는 생명체는 아무도 없었다. 결국 마왕은 잠재력이 강한 인간 용사들을 단련시켜 본인을 죽일 수 있도록 하는 비밀 계획을 시행에 옮기는데! 마왕은 대체 왜 이러는 걸까? 그리고 무사히 원하는 바를 이룰 수 있을까?

기획의도
안녕하세요. 세상을 즐겁게 만들려고 매일같이 애쓰는 whed입니다. 근래에 출시되는 모바일 게임들은 대부분 비슷한 설정으로 진행됩니다.
1)유저는 용사를 조종해서 단지 레벨업 하기 위해 몬스터들과 싸움을 계속합니다.(요즘은 조종도 안하고 자동으로 싸우죠.)
2)유저는 용사를 레벨업 시키면서 어떻게 키울지 고심하지만, 고민이 무색하게 결국 '국민테크트리'를 따라 모두 똑같은 방향으로 성장시키게 됩니다.(결국에는 고민도 안하게 되지요.) 
3)재밌게 게임을 하다 어느 순간 현금을 쓰지 않으면 더 이상 진행을 못할만큼 어려워져서 포기하게 됩니다.(게임 회사도 먹고 살아야겠지만 좀 심하잖아요.)
우리는 이런 모바일 게임들에 완전히 질려 버렸습니다. 모두 껍데기만 다른 예쁘기만할 뿐인 게임들에 말이죠. 그래서 우리는 이 세상에 없는 장르의 게임을 만들기로 했습니다. 우리의 일상은 ""기존 방식과 다르면서 재미있는 게임을 만들고 싶다""는 고민의 연속이었습니다. 고민할 필요 없는 것들은 과감히 생략하고 재미있는 요소만을 남겨놓기로 했습니다. 그 길고 긴 인고의 시간을 보내고, 드디어 야심작 ""마왕 죽기로 결심하다""를 만들게 됐습니다.
장르""게임에서 이기기 위해서는 적이 강해지도록 키워 주어야 한다""는 설정은 저희가 아는 바로는 기존에 찾아볼 수 없는 장르입니다. 그래서 우리는 이 새로운 게임의 장르를 ""feeding "" 혹은 ""츤데레""라고 부릅니다.*Feeding : 적에게 고의로 죽어 적을 강하게 만드는게 목적적인 게임입니다.
*츤데레 (ツンデレ) : 재패니메이션이나 일본의 미소녀 게임에서 찾아볼 수 있는 등장인물의 인격 유형 가운데 하나를 일컫는 유행어입니다. 이 말은 ‘새침하고 퉁명스러운 모습’을 나타내는 일본어 의태어인 츤츤(つんつん )과 ‘부끄러워하는 것’을 나타내는 일본어 의태어 데레데레(でれでれ)의 합성어입니다. 즉, '츤데레 게임'은 퉁명스럽게 적과 싸우는 듯 보이지만, 사실은 적이 더 강해지도록 노력해야 하는 게임입니다.

플랫폼현재 계획으로는 iOS와 안드로이드를 지원합니다.
아트 컨셉
*용사들
용사라는 이름을 달기에는 과할만큼 귀엽고 명랑한 모습을 하고 있습니다. 어딘가 하나씩 부족해 보여서 유저들의 보호본능을 자극 하기에 부족함이 없어서 한껏 성장시키고 싶은 마음이 들게 하는 디자인입니다.
*몬스터
기괴하지만 미워할 수 없는 몬스터들입니다. 영문도 모른채 용사들과 싸워야 하고 마왕의 계획 때문인 것도 모른채 열심히 노력해도 늘 용사에게 패배하는 모습이 안 쓰럽기도 합니다.
*타이틀용사들과 몬스터가 전반적으로 귀엽다면 타이틀은 진지하고 싶었습니다. 어이없는 설정과 귀여운 캐릭터와 다르게 우리가 매우 진지하게 이 게임을 만들고 있다는 것을 보여줍니다.

게임룰
유저는 마왕의 입장이 되어 몬스터를 출전 시킵니다. 용사는 조정할 수 없습니다. 주인공은 용사인데도 말이죠. 용사는 자동으로 몬스터와 싸우고, 이기면 자동으로 성장합니다. 유저는 용사의 파라메터에 신경 쓸게 전혀 없어요. 허약한 용사가 죽지 않고 무럭무럭 강해질 수 있도록 적절한 조합으로 몬스터를 출전시켜야 합니다. 용사가 몬스터와 싸워서 모두 죽으면 실패합니다. 어찌됐든 용사들이 죽지 않도록 몬스터들을 먹여 줘야 합니다. 무럭 무럭 강해진 용사가 무사히 마왕을 무찌를 수 있도록 기도하세요.

배급전략

우리는 강력한 퍼블리셔와 손을 잡지도 않을 것이고, 반복적인 게임 내 광고 노출로 유저를 현혹하지도 않으려고 합니다. 퍼블리셔가 제공하는 막강한 지원은 달콤하지만, 퍼블리셔에게만 유리한 계약 조건들은 스타트업이 감내하기에는 너무나 큰 위험이 되기도 합니다. 우리는 스스로의 힘으로 최대한 많은 언어로 최대한 많은 나라에 출시할 계획입니다. 우리가 출시한 여러 나라중에 어느 한 곳에서라도 '마왕 죽기로 결심하다'가 가능성을 보인다면 그때에 퍼블리셔와 계약해도 늦지 않을 것이라 생각합니다. 펀딩 목표액은 20만 달러 입니다. 한국어와 영어로 2016년 1Q에 출시할 예정입니다. 추가 1만 달러마다 일어, 중국어, 독어, 스페인어, 프랑스어, 아랍어, 러시아어, 포르투칼어, 이탈리아어, 터키어다음 순서대로 언어를 하나씩 추가할 예정입니다.

회사소개안녕하세요 '웨드'입니다. 저희는 '널리 사람을 즐겁게 하라'는 목표를 갖고 만들어진 회사입니다. 그 첫걸음으로 게임 개발을 시작합니다. 우리가 생각할 때 게임에서 가장 중요한 경쟁력은 '기획력'입니다. 그래서 우리의 직원들중 반은 기획자들입니다. 앞으로 회사가 커지더라도 기획자들 중심의 조직으로 만들어나갈 계획입니다.

Nice to Meet You.</h3> <p>A funny little thing happened in 2011 when a party game that would change all parties came along. You know what game we're talking about. In April of 2014 a group of friends at Boston University brainstormed some of the most hilariously terrible cards for that game that they could think of with material related to BU and made their own expansion. Terriers Against Humankind was born.</p>
<p>We're looking to expand this pet project into a campus-wide thing. Here's what we want to deliver to you:</p> <ul> <li>54 total cards; 8 black and 46 white that relate to life at and around BU.</li> <li>A box that holds all those cards.</li> <li>Happiness.</li> </ul> <p>Take a look at the video above and the pictures below to get an idea of the cards that are guaranteed to be in the pack, then proceed with caution.</p>
<p><b>Important Note:</b> We are <i>not</i> affiliated with Cards Against Humanity. You need to own Cards Against Humanity to use Terriers Against Humankind. Buy Cards Against Humanity here: <a href=""https://store.cardsagainsthumanity.com/)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://store.cardsagainsthumanity.com/</a> It's good for everyone.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Update 3/17/19, 9:57pm</b>: Backers, if you have any card suggestions or topics that you think would make a funny card, go to our Facebook page and comment on our post relating to this topic. We'd like to include a few community cards/ideas if we haven't already written something similar! </p>

</h3>
</div><div> <p> Two things come to mind that could cause slight delays with the project. We have anticipated these and attempted to build them into our delivery estimate, but nobody is perfect.</p> <ul> <li>Given that we are prepared to order a very small amount of the expansions, the manufacturer that we are planning on using (and have our designs on file with) has smaller capabilities than some larger printing companies. This has the potential to cause a longer than estimated production time.

<div><br/></div> </div> <p>Thanks,</p><p>The Terriers Against Humankind ""Team""</p></div>","You're Terrible. You're a Terrier. Nice to Meet You. A funny little thing happened in 2011 when a party game that would change all parties came along. You know what game we're talking about. In April of 2014 a group of friends at Boston University brainstormed some of the most hilariously terrible cards for that game that they could think of with material related to BU and made their own expansion. Terriers Against Humankind was born.
We're looking to expand this pet project into a campus-wide thing. Here's what we want to deliver to you:  54 total cards; 8 black and 46 white that relate to life at and around BU. A box that holds all those cards. Happiness.  Take a look at the video above and the pictures below to get an idea of the cards that are guaranteed to be in the pack, then proceed with caution.
Important Note: We are not affiliated with Cards Against Humanity. You need to own Cards Against Humanity to use Terriers Against Humankind. Buy Cards Against Humanity here: https://store.cardsagainsthumanity.com/ It's good for everyone.

Update 3/17/19, 9:57pm: Backers, if you have any card suggestions or topics that you think would make a funny card, go to our Facebook page and comment on our post relating to this topic. We'd like to include a few community cards/ideas if we haven't already written something similar!

*Card design and content is subject to change. Cards seen in the video are prototypes. The finished product will look closer to the photos you see above.

What Can You Get?

Here's the deal:


You can get Terriers Against Humankind for $15**.
Bonus: If we reach $1000 we will create a white card for each backer with their name on it.
Bonus 2: If we reach $1300 we will do the $1000 bonus, and we will also create a black card for each customer that uses their name in the card.
Bonus 3: If we reach $1800 we will do all previous bonuses and find a place on campus to host a ""launch"" party. It will have free pizza and tables to play Cards Against Humanity and TAH with us! We'll also add some more cards to the pack!

**This covers the cost of manufacturing, shipping to get the products to us, the fees that Indiegogo and their payment services charge, and the money needed to offset the small amount of tax we may need to pay on the funds we receive.

What We Need & When You'll Get Shit Stuff 
 Here's the breakdown:  We need money. 




Just kidding, not that much. $500 to be specific. No matter how we reach that goal, cards will be printed and delivered. We take the money when the campaign ends and go to the printer. We say the magic word and they start working. Sometime a few weeks into April, the printer will call us up when the job is done. They'll ship us the cards and we'll organize one or two pick-up days ON CAMPUS based on a list of days all funders will vote on. This will probably be done at the GSU. If you are not a student on campus and are pledging to the campaign and need your cards SHIPPED, please select the pledge level that is $6 more. This includes the price of a USPS small flat rate box.



Are the cards going to offend me?

We can't say for sure because we aren't you. We've selected and edited the cards from brainstorming sessions where we wrote over 200 cards. The cards that are included in this expansion are only the funniest, and only the ones that we feel don't target any specific student or small group on campus. While we wrote the cards to be edgy, we don't want to offend any student on a personal or individual level because they feel their identity is being targeted. Instead, we opted to poke fun at everyone equally and lightheartedly which makes things more fun anyway.


Can I play it without Cards Against Humanity?!
No! The purpose of Terriers Against Humankind is to complement the Cards Against Humanity base game. You need Cards Against Humanity to use Terriers Against Humankind. It's only $25 for the Cards Against Humanity game so if you don't own it, buy it already! (https://store.cardsagainsthumanity.com/)

Did you make Cards Against Humanity?
No! This expansion is unofficial and unlicensed. Neither Cards Against Humanity nor Boston University are affiliated with this expansion. The people at Cards Against Humanity  deserve full credit for the game and our only goal is to complement their  game with an awesome expansion (that only earned a B- thanks to grade deflation). Go buy their game if you haven't already at: https://store.cardsagainsthumanity.com/
   

Risks & Challenges

  Two things come to mind that could cause slight delays with the project. We have anticipated these and attempted to build them into our delivery estimate, but nobody is perfect.  Given that we are prepared to order a very small amount of the expansions, the manufacturer that we are planning on using (and have our designs on file with) has smaller capabilities than some larger printing companies. This has the potential to cause a longer than estimated production time. We've tried our best to calculate production time, but it's possible that this could be extended by a week or two. As with any sort of print job, misprints can happen. We have built into the goal of the campaign some cushion room to get extra expansions for replacement if this happens.
We will update you all as the project moves along to keep you aware of the project status! 
   Other Ways You Can Help Us Be Terrible As college students, we understand you may not be able to contribute monetarily. All your money is going to tuition and you can't even afford ramen. That's ok:  Check us out on Twitter and spread awareness (links on this page)! Tell your friends.
Don't tell your parents.
Go outside, breathe the fresh air, and contemplate the subpar performance of the Green Line.

We've provided players with the freedom to become the heroes they want to be!ASSEMBLE YOUR HERO LINE-UPPlayers can pick three Heroes for their line-up. As each turn begins, players can pick a hero from their line-up to take into that turn. The hero selected will determine which cards are drawn for that turn, what ultimates are accessed, and the hero power. This allows multiple strategies and strengths in a line-up for players to adapt their gameplay strategy as the game progresses.These three Heroes each have a unique pool of cards under their command. At the start of each turn, you will select which hero will lead your assault. This will determine which deck your next card will come from. This system turns deck building into a dynamic part of your gameplay experience because you tweak your deck to your preferences at each and every turn.GET SPOILT We’ve developed Infinity Heroes with variety in mind. With a rotating roster of heroes, players are spoilt for choice! Our most recent Hero Spotlight on Aberion, will give you some insight on how we design and plan out decks:REWARDSBacking our project unlocks a bunch of long lasting in game rewards.

Stretch GoalsWe'll be giving more to our backers from all campaigns, as well as adding to the core of the game with rewards. $5,000 - Alternate Hero ArtworkAll backers will vote on a hero / faction combination to receive an alternate artwork to be unlocked. These alternate arts will be timed exclusives for backers. Maybe you want to see Rita with Genesis technology, or a demonic Aberion, or maybe even Patient Zero before he was fully claimed by the infection. Let us know, and it'll get done!Voting will commence shortly after the goal is reached, and only backers may vote. However, this tier will repeat EVERY $5,000.

It represents several sacrifices gladly made by a bunch of people who were passionate about building a game that effectively captures the nuances of cricket. A game that went beyond simply asking the player to choose where to smash his next six. One that required the player to do something he'd never done before in a cricket game: consider the quality and form of his batsmen and the opposition bowlers.While it is certainly possible to win a match by simply coming out and risking it all from the first over - throwing your bat at everything and hoping for the best - long-term success is far more realistic if you plan and pace your innings the way the pros do it.Ultimately, the game rewards a combination of aggression and patience. No match is ever the same and, more than any other cricket game, Pocket Cricket puts the player in scenarios faced by real batsmen. This was our aim. To create a game that makes our players whoop with joy when they manage to squeeze a last-ball yorker past point for the winning single. To make them laugh in relief when an edged drive eludes the diving slip fielder. To make them holler in grief when a form batsman is caught on the boundary for a 125-ball 98. To make them WORK for a win.Because we know that while hitting sixes is fun, there's a lot more to batting than that.Pocket Cricket creator and cricket supergeek Adriaan du Toit first had the idea of a decision-based cricket game back in 2003 - right at the start of his career as a business analyst.As with all worthwhile ideas, it wouldn't let him go and over the decade that followed the concept crystalised into a data model and UI. During mid 2013 he would mention his idea to Cape Town property investor Ian de Kock, who would be so impressed with the unrehearsed pitch that he put up the funds for the creation of the proof of concept.The two of them created the company Nrvs Games and went in search of a technical partner.Fortunately for them the very first company they made contact with was startup studio PlayLogix, where CEO Roger Norton and technical lead Dean Boonzaaier would see the concepts come to life.Comic book and storyboard artist Rial de Wet was the next piece of the puzzle to fall in place. His unique artistic vision is what gave Pocket Cricket its distinct visual flair.The game was published over Christmas 2013 and through nothing more than minimal online promotion immediately grew a small but loyal following. the r/Cricket subreddit in particular had several extremely complimentary threads.Over the next three years countless attempts to fund the Full Version were made but, despite a number of them looking extremely promising, none succeeded.Three months ago, the team decided that it was time to turn to our existing player-base for funding.And here we are. Despite its depth and level of complexity, Pocket Cricket has a very simple, elegant interface.Based on several factors, including the line and length of the delivery, the field setting and the current form of the bowler, the player chooses which part of the field they want the batsman to hit the ball.Once the direction of the shot is selected the player selects the aggression with which they want to attack the ball - push it for a single, hit it for a boundary or loft it for a maximum.Pocket Cricket combines all these variables, including batsman and bowler form, into a mechanic that determines the risk of the selected shot and generates a minigame with variable difficulty for the player to play. The outcome of the minigame determines the success of the shot.The player needs to stop the pointer inside the green timing zone in order to register a perfectly struck shot. Doing so means that the ball has been hit with the exact placement and timing as intended. Stopping the pointer in the amber zone means that the ball has been well timed, but the placement is off.Stopping the pointer anywhere else (referred to as the red zone) means that the ball has either been badly mistimed or that it's been missed entirely.What makes this interesting is that the size of the green zone is augmented by the form of the batsman. If your player has a high form value, the green and amber zones are bigger, making a risky shot easier to pull off.The bowler's form is also taken into consideration here. The higher his form, the faster the pointer moves. Attempting a difficult shot early in your innings against an in-form bowler will present you with an extremely difficult minigame,Later in your innings, however, you may come up against a tired bowler and your in-form batsman could start getting creative, flicking yorkers over short-fine-leg, cutting good-length balls over cover and so forth. The actual outcome of a particular shot also also based on several factors. Not every ball you strike directly to a fielder will be stopped. And neither will every well timed shot reach the boundary,After playing your stroke, the outcome is generated and presented. This includes displaying how the outcome affected the batsman and bowler's form. A positive outcome will decrease the bowler's form while raising the batsman's and vice-versa.What is our long-term vision for Pocket Cricket and how will this campaign contribute to achieving it?Pocket Cricket it it's current guise is the framework upon which we want to build a continuously evolving gaming environment, releasing new features, rule updates and gameplay enhancements on an ongoing basis. Our goal is to keep our users engaged by keeping the game relevant and fresh - providing them with new challenges in an ever-evolving gaming environment.This campaign is to fund rebuilding core parts of the game's architecture in order to facilitate the features we have in mind for the future. All of these are listed in the ""New features"" section below. Some of them are covered by the main funding goal of $32 000 and some are associated with our two stretch goals.While the majority of the campaign funds will go towards features that our fans have requested, much of it will also go towards creating a more stable, extensible environment that can be monetised.Creating revenue is critical for this vision to become a reality. And while we guarantee our donors that we will never make the basic enjoyment of the game dependent on payment, there will be some features and levels that will only be accessible to players who have purchased premium membership at a very reasonable cost of $11.00.More on this below.If our campaign is successful we intend to pack what is already one of the most innovative cricket game around with even more groundbreaking features, all combining to give our players the most enjoyable and authentic cricket gaming experience possible.Play the BETA version at www.pocketcricket.net------------------- MAIN GOAL: $ 32 000 -------------------The BETA version of Pocket Cricket is only playable in your browser. Should our funding campaign be successful, we will launch a Steam Greenlight campaign which should see the game released on the most popular PC gaming platform.The web version of the game will remain online - meaning that our players will still be able to play Pocket Cricket wherever they have access to a browser. We get it. Pocket Cricket is a difficult game. It was meant to be. But we also get that sometimes our players wanna just put their cricket brains in neutral and have a bit of a hit-and-giggle. I mean, we didn't create the art for an off-stump yorker switch hit just so it can be seen once every 20 matches!Pocket Cricket's full version will have a shorter 5-over match series which will test our players' ability to deposit as many balls into the stands - and make as many bowlers cry - as possible. Currently your batsmen's form is reset at the start of each match. This means that regardless of your players' performances in the previous encounter, you are ensured of minimum and maximum form value. However, as MANY of our fans pointed out, this is not only unfair, it's unrealistic.So we're going to implement a logic that has your batsman take a percentage of the form he gained from his previous match into the next encounter so that by the time you're facing the big guns in the latter stages of the series your players should ideally be boasting some pretty good numbers.This will work both ways, however. Ending an innings with negative form will result in a form penalty in the next match.Run outs were a pretty controversial component of Pocket Cricket BETA. Mainly because, just like in real cricket, they're not always preventable.Based on a particular likelihood logic, each time there was a run, your batsmen had a chance to be run out regardless of your in-game decisions.The Full Version of Pocket Cricket will give players the ability to prevent losing a wicket in the worst way possible by presenting them with a run-out prevention minigame whenever there was going to be a run-out.It's a batsman's game right? No bowler would come up with a rule this cruel. You make a mistake and you get punished. Twice.Regardless of how inhumane it is, it was a very popular request from our BETA players. ""Please guys, give us the ability to humiliate my opponent even more!""In the Pocket Cricket Full Version we're introducing no-balls. Meaning that not only will you occasionally get an extra run without the ball being subtracted from your remaining deliveries, you'll also have a risk-free free-hit the delivery after.With the introduction of the Form Retention feature above, we felt it was important to give our players the ability to bring in a player who's current form is appropriate for the context of the match.You could be cruising. Needing 90 runs from 110 balls when you lose your first wicket. Why bring in your form player when you can push an out of form player up the order so he can spend some time in the middle, playing himself in for the next match.At the same time, you'll need to bring in your big-hitting form player at the expense of a batsman lacking confidence if you're looking for quick runs and you're under pressure.NOTE: This feature will be limited to players who purchase Premium Membership for a once-off cost of $11.00.Currently the Pocket Cricket single player mode offers players a relatively limited campaign experience - thirty sequential matches against ten increasingly challenging opponents.The purpose of this series was simple - win all 30 matches with the best possible Net Run Rate to appear on the leaderboard.Pocket Cricket's Full Version will extend this series by a further 30 matches, adding an additional 10 teams to the roster of opponents. Premium membership featureAll Premium Members will be able to access and display their team's performance history and player statistics on their team profile page. See your player averages and career strike rates. Reminisce about the time they played a career-best innings and view the scorecards of each match your team ever played.In addition to being able to view this data, they will also be able to customise their player names, upload a team profile image as well as a personal profile picture. Because what's the point in nabbing the number one spot in your country's hi-scores list if no one knows what you look like?There was a distinct lack of leather against willow in Pocket Cricket's BETA version. This is something we will address in the full version.  A significant investment will be made in rebuilding technical components of the game that created stutters in the timing minigame and other performance issues that had a negative effect on gameplay.The goal is to create a technical environment scalable enough to accommodate our long-term vision for Pocket Cricket (See ""Our Vision"" above). This comprises a relatively small portion of the funding amount but we feel it should be disclosed nonetheless.The name Pocket Cricket was selected three years ago because our intention was to take the game in a mobile direction immediately after the BETA release.However, the decision having been made to focus on the browser and PC versions of the game for the foreseeable future, we feel that the name no longer captures the spirit of our game.We'll be looking to our donors for input on the name change. --------------- STRETCH GOAL 1: $42 000 ---------------If the funding campaign exceeds our main goal by the specified amount, we will implement a gameplay element that is unprecedented in sports gaming: role playing mechanics.Every second form level reached by a batsman, he unlocks a Skill. The player selects which one of several Skills should be unlocked, based on the context of the match. The Skill remains active throughout the batsman's innings and provides a number of benefits for the batsman and, in some cases, his batting partner.The Skills currently planned are as follows:Your player's placement when hitting straight deliveries to the leg side is significantly improved and the likelihood of picking up a boundary much greater.Front foot shots straight down the ground are significantly more likely to beat fielders and reach the boundary.Finding a single or extra run when nudging the ball in the direction of any fielder is greatly increased with no increase in the likelihood of a run-out.Your player thrives when the opposition shows weakness and receives a timing bonus when facing a bowler with a low form.The batsman thrives against against top quality opposition and sees his form increase rapidly when facing bowlers with high form levels.Your player's excellent running between the wickets means that a run-out when he is at the crease is virtually impossible.Your player's calming influence on his batting partner means that a percentage of his form increase is shared by the non-striker.Fear is not in this batsman's vocabulary and his ability to pull off an impossible shot when the pressure is on is greatly improved. --------------- STRETCH GOAL 2: $57 000 ---------------Reaching our second stretch goal will enable us to build the gaming platform that we've intended to when we first kicked off this project: the world's first multiplayer cricket arena. Premium membership featureIn order to enable the multiplayer arena (see below) players will need to determine a default bowling strategy.This will be done by allocating a pool of ""base"" form points to their five bowlers. The option being to create their ideal configuration of player quality. Do you want three legends supported by two clowns who won't get a bowl in a club net session? Or do you want five workhorses who are unlikely to set the world on fire but won't let the team down either?Experiment as much as you want and figure out with what works best for you. Premium membership featureThe ultimate Pocket Cricket experience. Take on the world to TRULY claim your place as the best cricket strategist with a couple of hours to kill every day.The principle that makes Pocket Cricket multiplayer possible is non-synchronous gameplay. An issue with playing a long game against another person is that they may need to stop playing at some point in the middle of the game just when you're getting warmed up. We don't want that.While the fielding team is able to monitor the state of the opponent's innings, he does not actively control his bowlers beyond the bowler management functionality detailed above.If you want to play a friendly match, all you have to do is find an opponent and challenge them. If they are a Premium Member you will immediately start batting against their bowlers. When they log on to the Pocket Cricket servers, they will see that you have played an innings against them and commence their response innings.The Multiplayer Arena's main purpose is to serve as the platform for worldwide leagues and regular cup tournaments. Competitions where cricket fans across the planet can test each others' skills.We have decided to limit our donation perks to digital rewards. While there is a clear benefit in offering donors physical rewards, we are very aware of the cost and fulfillment risks these involved.We are dedicated to producing this product for the most reasonable cost and factoring in the cost and overheard of creating and delivering t-shirts and fridge magnets is simply too big a compromise in this regard.With that in mind, we are proud to offer the following perks to our donors:Your name will appear on the game's Honours Board section underneath the heading associated with your perk level, with preference given to the higher donors.Producers will have their photos displayed next to their name, while Executives' entry will include a link to a video where we personally thank the donor.Access to all the game's premium features for now and forever more.Higher level perks offer additional Premium Memberships that you can give to your friends.As you can see from the game and this campaign page, Pocket Cricket has some seriously beautiful art. This perk is a set of six professionally designed wallpapers featuring art from the game thanking the recipient for their support.Please bear in mind that, since Pocket Cricket's name is going to change, the wallpaper will feature the game's new name.As above, but the files will be of a higher resolution allowing the recipient to print out A3-sized posters. As with the wallpaper set and Hi-res poster art, but including a personal message of thanks with your name and photo.Donors who purchase this Perk will receive access to the game several weeks prior to its official release date, a time during which we and our testers (see the Producer and Executive Perks) will balance the game's numerous rules and difficulty settings.Early access means that you will be assisting in testing by having your matches monitored, but we will not be seeking your feedback on the game's playability.As mentioned earlier, we will be rebranding Pocket Cricket during the development of the Full Version. Donors who select this perk will contribute name suggestions and stand the chance of being the person who came up with our new name.Credit will be given to this donor in the Honors Board.Receive access to the game prior to its release date and assist our team in performing testing that enables us to configure its difficulty settings.This is a crucial role in the development process and feedback in this regard is taken very seriously. Become a digital celebrity! We name one of the CPU bowlers after you.This perk is limited to 100 and donors who snap it up first will be given preference in terms of the quality if the bowler who assumes their identity.Name one of the CPU teams that every single Pocket Cricket player will come up against. We obviously reserve the right to reject an offensive name here but other than that, anything goes so get creative.In closing... why should you help us make this project a reality?We've already shown that we have the creative and technical ability to build a truly unique, fun and challenging cricket game. Play Pocket Cricket BETA here.We have been in constant contact with our loyal fans via a number of online cricket communities and taken all their feedback on the game into consideration when designing the Full Version.Barring certain extended features, the game will be free to play. Always. This is a guarantee. We will never give any in-game benefit to paying players. The world needs our game. Cricket is a sport that has never really been replicated in this space and we are on the verge of changing that!We sincerely look forward to interacting some more with our potential donor-base. Please feel free to get in touch with any questions you may have,",64.0,0,"1 Campaign

What is Cursed West?
Cursed West contains the spirit of Glories of the past, Holding aspects such as Difficulty and Mechanics. Adding more modern visuals in both, levels with traditional 2d gameplay, as in the 3d levels
The game presents levels where you advance on a traditional way from left to right, where we must advance defeating enemies, also there's levels 3d were we must past without raising suspicious and undetected
There are also levels were we ride our horse and we must pass trough the level or survive
The game will count with different possible endings, and 2 unlockable modes: ""Boss rush mode""(with added timer for beating the bosses) and ""alternative campaign"" (You can take control of an alternative character)







Why is this a flexible campaign?
The money raised will be used to improve characters, animation and other stuff.Even if the campaign doesn't raises 100% as objective, what can be raise will help a lot!, we will be eternally grateful with those who colaborated, every penny will be a step closer to accomplish this Big Dream!

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>My name is David and I'm from Spain. I'm supposed to give you a long talk about me but I'm not going to do that because what you have in your mind is a question...</p>
<p><i><u>Can this guy deliver?</u></i></p>
<p>And talking about me will tell you nothing about that. But I can show you my actions and you can judge for yourself.</p>
<p>I've been recording videos of my progress since I started and you can watch them on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/masterneme/videos"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">my channel</a> (it opens a new window).</p>
<h3>Project Boon</h3>
<p>Let's talk about the project and what you're getting from it.</p>
<p>Some time ago I thought: ""Everybody loves Brutal Doom, why is nobody doing something like it but with modern engines?"" And there it all began.</p>
<p>This is Project Boon, you'll get a Brutal Doom like experience with a modern look using Unreal Engine and fully integrated with Steam.</p>
<p>It doesn't look very ""brutal"" because I haven't implemented the gore yet but it's coming.</p>
<p>You may have noticed that there are two names written, Project Boon and ProBoon. Why is this?</p>
<p>I started with the intention of making a Doom reimagination but as time went by I decided that instead of doing just this I could create a system that could work on top of different engines so people could develop their own sprite-based shooters without investing time into building the logic behind it.</p>
<p>It's modding on steroids.</p>
<p>So Project Boon is this base and ProBoon is the game resulted from it.</p>
<p>This means that when you support this campaign you're not only getting all the adrenaline fueled shooting action, you're also opening the door for other potential cool games.</p>
<p>And this is because I'll share all the logic and if someone else improves it and make contributions it'll keep growing and instead of mods you'll have fully fledged high quality stand alone games made by talented people.</p>
<p>A community built around the love of old-school first person shooters.</p>
<h3>ProBoon</h3>
<p>ProBoon is, therefore, the game I'm making using Project Boon, an enhanced Doom Clone in essence, and this is what you WILL get when you support it:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 episodes with 10 levels each</li>
<li>Implementations of Doom II's weapons and enemies including the almighty Super Shotgun and BFG</li>
<li>Multiplayer cooperative play</li>
<li>Deathmatch, including Free For All, Team Deathmatch or 1on1</li>
<li>A 4th episode with its own game mode, Invasion, taking inspiration from Stronghold (mod), Complex Doom Invasion (mod) and Killing Floor (game). Play it alone or online with your friends</li>
<li>Big levels with hundreds of monsters and weird architecture</li>
<li>Tons of gibs and blood</li>
<li>Easy to use server browser and server hosting capabilities</li>
<li>Spectator and demo recording capabilities</li>
<li>Speedrun mode with integrated chrono</li>
</ul>
<p>This is what you WON'T get:</p>
<ul>
<li>Several minutes of logos</li>
<li>Lootboxes or microtransactions</li>
<li>Your experience compromised because the central server is shut down</li>
<li>Boring, long, unnecessary cutscenes</li>
<li>Politics or a hidden agenda</li>
<li>An attempt to make it an esport forgetting about being a fun game first</li>
<li>Quicktime events</li>
</ul>
<p>This is what you MIGHT get with extra funding:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Master Server to allow cross-play between the Steam and DRM-Free versions</li>
<li>HUGE multiplayer maps for 100 or more players with or without respawn (like Battle Royale)</li>
<li>A dedicated server executable to create your own customized server</li>
<li>Compatibility with the Steam Workshop to have new skins, maps, etc.</li>

My name is David and I'm from Spain. I'm supposed to give you a long talk about me but I'm not going to do that because what you have in your mind is a question...
Can this guy deliver?
And talking about me will tell you nothing about that. But I can show you my actions and you can judge for yourself.
I've been recording videos of my progress since I started and you can watch them on my channel (it opens a new window).
Project Boon
Let's talk about the project and what you're getting from it.
Some time ago I thought: ""Everybody loves Brutal Doom, why is nobody doing something like it but with modern engines?"" And there it all began.
This is Project Boon, you'll get a Brutal Doom like experience with a modern look using Unreal Engine and fully integrated with Steam.
It doesn't look very ""brutal"" because I haven't implemented the gore yet but it's coming.
You may have noticed that there are two names written, Project Boon and ProBoon. Why is this?
I started with the intention of making a Doom reimagination but as time went by I decided that instead of doing just this I could create a system that could work on top of different engines so people could develop their own sprite-based shooters without investing time into building the logic behind it.
It's modding on steroids.
So Project Boon is this base and ProBoon is the game resulted from it.
This means that when you support this campaign you're not only getting all the adrenaline fueled shooting action, you're also opening the door for other potential cool games.
And this is because I'll share all the logic and if someone else improves it and make contributions it'll keep growing and instead of mods you'll have fully fledged high quality stand alone games made by talented people.
A community built around the love of old-school first person shooters.
ProBoon

<p> I have been in game development of simple games since the beginning 
of 2013, but it took me almost a year and a half to get knowledge and 
skills in making a game, which is NOT completely copying another already
 existing game. Then I decided to use the platform called Indiegogo 
where nice people contribute to those who has brilliant ideas for 
different aspects. Since I am first year student in Hotelschool the 
Hague, a university, which has 2 campuses but I study in the one located
 in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Being a student often means that you 
have to limited amount of money that you can spend freely for what 
delights you. It is a common knowledge that game developing is NOT 
cheap, so that is why I turned to you guys. Game developing is a hobby 
for me, it delights me to rack my brains around different ideas of new 
games and banging my head against how to implement them in a real

Check out the lowest pledge ($1): it allows you to own the game! These days, being dank isn't enough. You have to be the dankiest. Nowadays, being dank is not enough. You have to be the dankest. That is why more than 2 million people committed to visit Area 51 on September 20 of this year. This game is a simulator of that historic day. Completely re-enacting the terrain of Area 51, you will command 1,999,999 units. Largest army ever seen in an RTS. 
Your troops will include: Kyle units, Naruto runners, Karen Banshees, Anti-vax kids (cannon fodder), Rock Throwers, Death Clappers (pictured above), Furries, Yeetus (artillery units), and more than 16 special units including the 69 ft Keanu -nice!

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h2>A hard-boiled construction simulator at heart with the substance and clarity of a refined strategy.</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Starting from classic city builders of the genre, Terminus takes the terrifying leap into the frontier of space where every new game and new colonization effort bring a wildly different experience on a new, procedurally generated planet. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>You are the administrator of the colony and it's your mission to keep humanity going by any means possible.  Colonists are mouths to feed, supplies are dwindling and almost everything is non-renewable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Plan for long term growth while dealing with short-term crises, survey and exploit planet-side resources faster than you can use them up, perform critical research to offset the difficulty of living off-world and issue colony-wide directives to shape the growth of the only home of humanity, keep the old ways of thinking alive or forge a brave new world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""A barren place to call home"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/621218/pictures/full/20130117092902-newtitan2.JPG?1358443748"" src="""" style=""float: left;"" title=""Desolate Landscapes""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Plot</h3>
<p>Earth is doomed, we know it, you know it, your neighbour knows it.  In Terminus everybody knows it because astronomers spot tremendous amounts of impact events on the outskirt of the solar system.  First Pluto is pummeled, then we can see the surface of Neptune and Uranus deluged by extrasolar rock.  It's determined by the data that an immense cloud of debris is intersecting our solar system and that every planet, moon and asteroid will be scoured by impact.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""Last stop before Earth"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/621206/pictures/full/20130117091924-Kablam__v1.jpg?1358443170"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Mars Impact""/></p>
<p>Knowing the end is coming decades ahead of time allowed the people of Earth plenty of opportunity to panic.  It was only after years of political and social chaos that a plan was hatched, the Terminus Project, the last option for a doomed civilization.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With the Earth expected to turn slightly molten within the century, mankind no longer felt the need to preserve it and so all restrictions on industry, pollution and most international treaties were dissolved or ignored.  Every industrial effort on the planet was turned towards constructing the components of the starship that would be needed. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""Impact"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/622638/pictures/full/20130118121319-fig_2.jpg?1358540006"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Impact""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Entire states and provinces became foundries, Australia became the launching pad for nuclear rockets, little more than a pallet of cargo on-top of a steel plate with a nuclear bomb underneath.  It was enough to get it into orbit and added to the 8,000,000 tonne ""Super Orion""-inspired ship that would take as much of humanity as possible to the stars.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""Colony Ship"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/621229/pictures/full/20130117094040-ship_for_AFX.png?1358444443"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Colony Ship""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<p>Terminus plays like a city-builder, as administrator you determine what buildings should be built and where, what parts of the planet to survey or clear for development, what research to perform to improve efficiency, and what social decisions to make to guide growth, or stifle chaos.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Terminus isn't just a sedate city-builder however, disaster management is a critical and integrated component of its gameplay.  Things go wrong in space and on other planets, and when they go wrong they can turn catastrophic.  You're not just designing a city that operates in the most efficient way possible, every decision made has to be made with ""What about if things go wrong?"" in the back of your head because things WILL go wrong.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Fire is deadly in space and the same is true in the closed environment of a colony, fire can spread from one building to another, killing people inside, damaging the building itself or causing a hull breach.  Fire isn't the only thing that spreads, biological hazards, disease, electrical disturbances, air-loss, every building is linked and you're in charge of the links.  Sometimes you have to seal an area off if you expect to keep the colony as a whole alive, but that building you just sealed off was the agricultural dome and people are starting to ask about food... but depending on the planet you pick, at least there might be plenty of water.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""Ice Planet"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/622639/pictures/full/20130118121337-de-snowbeings.JPG?1358540025"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Ice Planet""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Buildings</h3>
<p>Buildings are the most vital elements of the colony, buildings consume power and resources, they refine or produce materials or perform some vital function in your colony such as housing or research.  Buildings have more attributes than some RPG characters, with health, resistances to damage types and adjacency bonuses that encourage building your colony intelligently, but don't build too compactly because of...</p>
<h3>Disasters</h3>
<p>Every building in the colony is connected, most buildings have human workers and all of them are vulnerable to one form of disaster or another.  Some buildings are reinforced or naturally durable against fire or earthquake but might be vulnerable to the spread of disease, while other buildings might be resistant to power grid disruption but have incredibly weak skin and are prone to hull breaches, which, depending on the planet you're on, have immediate and dire consequences for any colonists inside.  The list of planned environmental effects are:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Fire - Does equal damage to buildings and colonists, spreads very rapidly to adjacent buildings (unless sealed) Has a chance of causing hull breaches, requires oxygen to exist, so can put itself out quite rapidly.</h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Earthquake - Does significant one-time damage to vulnerable buildings, rarely hurts colonists.  Can cause hull breaches and fires in rare cases.</h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Atmospheric Disturbance - Can cause electrical disruption or cause hull breaches or both depending on the atmosphere.</h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Electrical Disruption - Spreads from building to building causing reduced efficiency, does not hurt colonists.</h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Biohazard/Biological - Spreads from building to building, kills colonists but doesn't damage buildings</h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Meteorite Impact - Causes damage to buildings, may cause hull breach.  Larger impact events can wipe out multiple buildings.</h3>
</li>
</ul><h3>Research</h3>
<p>Technology is the best tool and survival mechanism humanity has on Earth and the same is true off-world.  Research Laboratories and Hazardous Experiment Labs can be constructed and operated by colonists.  You can only one run research project at a time no matter how many labs you build, but the more you have and the more scientists you have inside them the faster your research progresses.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Research can unlock new buildings, enhancements to existing buildings or divergent building classes, luxury residences compared to reinforced residences.  Research projects allow you to predict disasters or respond to them more effectively, even providing access to the...</p>
<h3>Crisis Response Emergency Workers (CREW)</h3>
<p>An elite team of disaster management professionals, the CREW are rescue workers, engineers and a SWAT team all rolled into one.  Once unlocked from research the CREW can be deployed to any building during a crisis, once there they can attempt to save the building, save the people, or simply try to scavenge as many materials as they can from the structure before it goes up in smoke.  The CREW are a vital and active tool to keep your colony going, no matter if they're sealing a hull breach, cleaning up a toxic waste spill or quelling a riot, the CREW is the first and best option for dealing with a situation going out of control.  But there's a lot you can do before it gets that bad, by using...</p>
<h3>Directives</h3>
<p>Government and centralized control is necessary more than ever when the only thing between humanity and extinction is a steady hand on the airlock control ready to make the decision to sacrifice a few lives to save the species.  Directives shape your colony and allow you to do everything from starting mineral surveys, deploying temporary damage control, instituting temporary rationing measures all the way to colony wide policy decisions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Policy decisions are unlocked by research and are mutually exclusive within their own category.  For example when it comes to the ""Disaster Response"" category you can choose between ""Evacuation Procedures"" which helps reduce colonist casualties, or you can elect to go with ""Facility Inspection"" which gives all buildings a better resistance against damage, or maybe you want to reduce the time it takes your CREW to get to the site of a disaster?  It all comes down to your colony design, the nature of the planet and the other choices you've made.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""Planets"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/621210/pictures/full/20130117092333-planet_set.png?1358443420"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Planets""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Big Picture</h3>
<p>All of these elements taken together create a tight, complex but easily understood game with tonnes of replayability.  Besides the big-picture base building and the fine-focus disaster management the game also offers the reflection and imagination that science fiction provides so well.  The variety of landscapes and design of the growing colony will of course be aesthetically pleasing, but for the curious player there will also be an opportunity to read in-game descriptions for each building and research project, the story of Terminus being told through the historical and fictional quotes added to each description, descriptions which are written with scientific accuracy in mind, following reality as close as possible while allowing for the theoretical.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The primary audience, the people who would get the most out of Terminus are the enthusiasts, the gamer who loves games for the challenge, because Terminus will be very challenging by default, but Terminus is intended to be a game suitable for anyone to play, of any age who are interested in the kind of setting and science that the game offers and difficulty can scale down for a slower paced game as much as it can scale up to offer a traumatizingly accurate portrayal of the difficulty of colonizing another planet.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""Power Generator"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/621208/pictures/full/20130117092043-spinny3_for_afx.png?1358443251"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: bottom;"" title=""Power Generator""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why we're crowdfunding</h3>
<p>Terminus is a game we want to make, many of us are students, young professionals or otherwise don't have the money to invest in the project to make it happen while still being able to put food in our mouths.  We think the game is a solid one though, so we're bringing it to you so you can get in on the ground floor and help this game exist.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If we don't reach our funding goals that won't stop us from trying to make the game, but we'll be missing crucial pieces of the puzzle; people, skills, licenses, assets... We're working with a fixed funding model so if we're even a dollar short of what we're asking for, everyone gets their pledge refunded.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And for those who have asked, we're using Indiegogo to fund our project because Kickstarter requires you to be a US or UK <strong>citizen</strong>. Our entire team is Canadian so it wasn't an option for us without jumping through some extreme hoops.</p>

<h3>Stretch Goals:</h3>
<p>@$27,000 - ""Heat"" management system added to extreme planets with additional HVAC buildings.  Extreme planets (Ice, Hot, Pressure/Storm) also get thematic makeover incl. improved textures and visual effects.</p>
<p>@$30,000 - Expanded environmental effects and visual improvements, more vigorous weather and storms, as well as lava flows!</p>
<p>@$35,000 - Custom ""Synth-Acoustic"" soundtrack embodying the best blend of synth and classical instruments such as the violin.</p></div>","A hard-boiled construction simulator at heart with the substance and clarity of a refined strategy.
 
Starting from classic city builders of the genre, Terminus takes the terrifying leap into the frontier of space where every new game and new colonization effort bring a wildly different experience on a new, procedurally generated planet. 
 
You are the administrator of the colony and it's your mission to keep humanity going by any means possible.  Colonists are mouths to feed, supplies are dwindling and almost everything is non-renewable.
 
Plan for long term growth while dealing with short-term crises, survey and exploit planet-side resources faster than you can use them up, perform critical research to offset the difficulty of living off-world and issue colony-wide directives to shape the growth of the only home of humanity, keep the old ways of thinking alive or forge a brave new world.
 

 
The Plot
Earth is doomed, we know it, you know it, your neighbour knows it.  In Terminus everybody knows it because astronomers spot tremendous amounts of impact events on the outskirt of the solar system.  First Pluto is pummeled, then we can see the surface of Neptune and Uranus deluged by extrasolar rock.  It's determined by the data that an immense cloud of debris is intersecting our solar system and that every planet, moon and asteroid will be scoured by impact.
 

Knowing the end is coming decades ahead of time allowed the people of Earth plenty of opportunity to panic.  It was only after years of political and social chaos that a plan was hatched, the Terminus Project, the last option for a doomed civilization.
 
With the Earth expected to turn slightly molten within the century, mankind no longer felt the need to preserve it and so all restrictions on industry, pollution and most international treaties were dissolved or ignored.  Every industrial effort on the planet was turned towards constructing the components of the starship that would be needed. 
 

 
Entire states and provinces became foundries, Australia became the launching pad for nuclear rockets, little more than a pallet of cargo on-top of a steel plate with a nuclear bomb underneath.  It was enough to get it into orbit and added to the 8,000,000 tonne ""Super Orion""-inspired ship that would take as much of humanity as possible to the stars.
 

 
Gameplay
Terminus plays like a city-builder, as administrator you determine what buildings should be built and where, what parts of the planet to survey or clear for development, what research to perform to improve efficiency, and what social decisions to make to guide growth, or stifle chaos.
 
Terminus isn't just a sedate city-builder however, disaster management is a critical and integrated component of its gameplay.  Things go wrong in space and on other planets, and when they go wrong they can turn catastrophic.  You're not just designing a city that operates in the most efficient way possible, every decision made has to be made with ""What about if things go wrong?"" in the back of your head because things WILL go wrong.
 
Fire is deadly in space and the same is true in the closed environment of a colony, fire can spread from one building to another, killing people inside, damaging the building itself or causing a hull breach.  Fire isn't the only thing that spreads, biological hazards, disease, electrical disturbances, air-loss, every building is linked and you're in charge of the links.  Sometimes you have to seal an area off if you expect to keep the colony as a whole alive, but that building you just sealed off was the agricultural dome and people are starting to ask about food... but depending on the planet you pick, at least there might be plenty of water.
 

 
Buildings
Buildings are the most vital elements of the colony, buildings consume power and resources, they refine or produce materials or perform some vital function in your colony such as housing or research.  Buildings have more attributes than some RPG characters, with health, resistances to damage types and adjacency bonuses that encourage building your colony intelligently, but don't build too compactly because of...
Disasters
Every building in the colony is connected, most buildings have human workers and all of them are vulnerable to one form of disaster or another.  Some buildings are reinforced or naturally durable against fire or earthquake but might be vulnerable to the spread of disease, while other buildings might be resistant to power grid disruption but have incredibly weak skin and are prone to hull breaches, which, depending on the planet you're on, have immediate and dire consequences for any colonists inside.  The list of planned environmental effects are:
 


Fire - Does equal damage to buildings and colonists, spreads very rapidly to adjacent buildings (unless sealed) Has a chance of causing hull breaches, requires oxygen to exist, so can put itself out quite rapidly.


Earthquake - Does significant one-time damage to vulnerable buildings, rarely hurts colonists.  Can cause hull breaches and fires in rare cases.


Atmospheric Disturbance - Can cause electrical disruption or cause hull breaches or both depending on the atmosphere.


Electrical Disruption - Spreads from building to building causing reduced efficiency, does not hurt colonists.


Biohazard/Biological - Spreads from building to building, kills colonists but doesn't damage buildings


Meteorite Impact - Causes damage to buildings, may cause hull breach.  Larger impact events can wipe out multiple buildings.

Research
Technology is the best tool and survival mechanism humanity has on Earth and the same is true off-world.  Research Laboratories and Hazardous Experiment Labs can be constructed and operated by colonists.  You can only one run research project at a time no matter how many labs you build, but the more you have and the more scientists you have inside them the faster your research progresses.
 
Research can unlock new buildings, enhancements to existing buildings or divergent building classes, luxury residences compared to reinforced residences.  Research projects allow you to predict disasters or respond to them more effectively, even providing access to the...
Crisis Response Emergency Workers (CREW)
An elite team of disaster management professionals, the CREW are rescue workers, engineers and a SWAT team all rolled into one.  Once unlocked from research the CREW can be deployed to any building during a crisis, once there they can attempt to save the building, save the people, or simply try to scavenge as many materials as they can from the structure before it goes up in smoke.  The CREW are a vital and active tool to keep your colony going, no matter if they're sealing a hull breach, cleaning up a toxic waste spill or quelling a riot, the CREW is the first and best option for dealing with a situation going out of control.  But there's a lot you can do before it gets that bad, by using...
Directives
Government and centralized control is necessary more than ever when the only thing between humanity and extinction is a steady hand on the airlock control ready to make the decision to sacrifice a few lives to save the species.  Directives shape your colony and allow you to do everything from starting mineral surveys, deploying temporary damage control, instituting temporary rationing measures all the way to colony wide policy decisions.
 
Policy decisions are unlocked by research and are mutually exclusive within their own category.  For example when it comes to the ""Disaster Response"" category you can choose between ""Evacuation Procedures"" which helps reduce colonist casualties, or you can elect to go with ""Facility Inspection"" which gives all buildings a better resistance against damage, or maybe you want to reduce the time it takes your CREW to get to the site of a disaster?  It all comes down to your colony design, the nature of the planet and the other choices you've made.
 

 
The Big Picture
All of these elements taken together create a tight, complex but easily understood game with tonnes of replayability.  Besides the big-picture base building and the fine-focus disaster management the game also offers the reflection and imagination that science fiction provides so well.  The variety of landscapes and design of the growing colony will of course be aesthetically pleasing, but for the curious player there will also be an opportunity to read in-game descriptions for each building and research project, the story of Terminus being told through the historical and fictional quotes added to each description, descriptions which are written with scientific accuracy in mind, following reality as close as possible while allowing for the theoretical.
 
The primary audience, the people who would get the most out of Terminus are the enthusiasts, the gamer who loves games for the challenge, because Terminus will be very challenging by default, but Terminus is intended to be a game suitable for anyone to play, of any age who are interested in the kind of setting and science that the game offers and difficulty can scale down for a slower paced game as much as it can scale up to offer a traumatizingly accurate portrayal of the difficulty of colonizing another planet.
 

 
Why we're crowdfunding
Terminus is a game we want to make, many of us are students, young professionals or otherwise don't have the money to invest in the project to make it happen while still being able to put food in our mouths.  We think the game is a solid one though, so we're bringing it to you so you can get in on the ground floor and help this game exist.
 
If we don't reach our funding goals that won't stop us from trying to make the game, but we'll be missing crucial pieces of the puzzle; people, skills, licenses, assets... We're working with a fixed funding model so if we're even a dollar short of what we're asking for, everyone gets their pledge refunded.
 
And for those who have asked, we're using Indiegogo to fund our project because Kickstarter requires you to be a US or UK citizen. Our entire team is Canadian so it wasn't an option for us without jumping through some extreme hoops.

We are using this platform of crowdfunding to be able to show our game to the world and to get a little push to help us deliver an even more polished and rich game.Backing up and helping this campaign will able us to deliver a more rich, complete and polished game for you and the gaming community to enjoy.  This base game is planned to be released through Steam shop platform around mid year 2018.But that is just what we have achieve on our own during more than a year of development, and just the basic of the game we want to produce.The money gathered during this campaign will be used to cover the cost of developing the rest of the game during the next few months.If we get to exceed the 9k goal, we will make more content for the game according to the amount and keep the developing team well paid.With this campaign completed we would be able to produce more content for the game and for you, the players.With the 9000 USD goal completed we would be able to add to the game:
Multiplayer online- Multiplayer is achievable in our current engine (Construct 2), but we need extra time and resources that we don't currently have. With your help we can get such coveted feature that will include random match-up and player searching functions. You can help us test the online by donating on the LEGEND tier.
 
More characters- With extra money we can get all the ideas we originally had with more varied and interesting Daemons/world evils like Geras the old age, Keres the painful death, Deimos and Phobos and many more.Titan level backers can get to choose which characters we add first.The one Olympian Tier backer can help us create a brand new Daemon from scratch.
 
More in-game artwork - Currently, characters only have 3 sprites each (plus different expressions). More money can let them to feel even more alive than they are now. 
 
Extra mode, Quest mode - Quest mode can give us freedom to include different gameplay styles and tell a whole new story to flesh out the Greek inspired world of Gematombe. This mode will have around 100 puzzle stages, including NPC interactions and a progressive story that tells the origins of the vase and the final quest for Pandora to enclose all the Daemons. Since this will require all the characters to be finished this will be added last, but we promise it won't disappoint.You or your character can even become an NPC by donating in the Demi God Tier.

 One extra goal that we would love to achieve but is currently out of our hands is voice acting for the characters. Only possible if we get to surpass the goal of this campaign by a good amount.The BASE GAME that we have worked so far contains: 
VS mode local - Engage your friends in puzzle battle action! In this classic couch versus mode, you select the stage and the contenders to settle a winner in a race for the first Gematombe! Who's the best? Find it out!

What started as an audiovisual project to accompany an upcoming album has instead grabbed the main focus to be developed as a standalone title by it's own merit, and your support will help realize this project!</p><p> </p><h2>The Future of StereoRem</h2><p>The available demonstration footage of StereoRem was produced in only a short amount of time from the first line of code to what is being shown, with development for StereoRem having begun around the end of June 2017. StereoRem exists in a playable state as of now, but if the project is funded, the funds will afford me to improve the graphics by investing in a more modern workstation, giving me access to a more true 3D API and redesigning the project with 3D graphics to quickly and efficiently replace much of the stuff currently present while continuing to build and add more 3D content. As of the starting of this campaign, the graphics in the game are psuedo-3D built from clever visual tricks on strictly 2D objects and shapes, so the visual fidelity from this first trailer to completion will only improve while staying true to the graphical style, but these graphical improvements will not be too excessive to be prohibitive against lower end computers. In the more technical sense, your support and funding will allow StereoRem to utilize the OpenGL2 API (or OpenGL2 and above), while being written in Java and deploying OpenGL also offers the benefit of StereoRem having a wide variety of compatibility across Windows, Mac and Linux setups for maintaining an intense 60 frames per second!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500582105/xrlda9kpipk78zunc5k4.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><ul><li><i>A few example renders of what 3D might offer object detail within StereoRem: a minimalist (though not low quality) approach to models relying instead on fantastic and exciting colors best enjoyed through motion.</i></li></ul><p>Estimated completion date may come before January, but in the event it takes longer for whatever reason, you will be well notified in advance. In a case of funding being well exceeded and any stretch goals being implemented, that may be one reason to account for a later-than-sooner delivery date.</p><p>My hopes are that when you finally do get to play StereoRem, you'll want to play it loud</p><p> </p><h2>About Reward Tiers</h2><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500760359/bepugto4kw2nra6xidvb.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>If you plan to support StereoRem, please first click on one of the reward tiers listed to the right! This will help keep track of who should be receiving which reward, otherwise the free write-in amount at the top of the page will not be attributed with a reward tier. I will do my best to get in contact with anyone who seemingly submits a funding but forgets to choose a perk, however IndieGoGo is all automatically setup to track this stuff if you first choose a perk to the right to decide your reward!</p><p>If you'd like to support more than just a reward tier, again first choose a reward tier to the right and after that has completed, feel free to use the write-in amount at the top of the page with the ""Back it"" button.</p><p> </p><h2>About funds</h2><p>The goal of $2,800 will afford me a new workstation and a little spending cash as I develop StereoRem. If funds are met right on the money, $300 immediately goes towards processing fees, leaving $2,400-$2,500 as the main take away. Of that, $100 will go towards a Steam submission to have StereoRem published on Steam Direct when it's finished. I'm looking to spend up to $1,000 on a new workstation and any extra appliances it may need, leaving me with about a grand and some change to afford basics for living that may be stretched out up to January 2018 while developing StereoRem. Not much if any of the funds will be needed for licensing fees as I'm writing most of the code myself or using free use libraries for sound and visuals (see OpenGL). So with fees in mind along with the Goals of improving StereoRem, I'm confident that $2,800 is a good price to settle on. Given the nature of these fees and the cost of a new workstation, I've elected to use the Fixed Funding option on Indiegogo as StereoRem will not be abled to reach it's development milestones without the aforementioned costs an otherwise Flexible Funding goal could fail to meet.</p><p> </p><h2>About Me (and About Music)</h2><p>I'm just a 28 year old guy living in Reno, Nevada. I've been a hobbyist musician most of my life with a primary interest in video game and electronic music, and for a long time have always wanted to make my own games.

What started as an audiovisual project to accompany an upcoming album has instead grabbed the main focus to be developed as a standalone title by it's own merit, and your support will help realize this project! The Future of StereoRemThe available demonstration footage of StereoRem was produced in only a short amount of time from the first line of code to what is being shown, with development for StereoRem having begun around the end of June 2017. StereoRem exists in a playable state as of now, but if the project is funded, the funds will afford me to improve the graphics by investing in a more modern workstation, giving me access to a more true 3D API and redesigning the project with 3D graphics to quickly and efficiently replace much of the stuff currently present while continuing to build and add more 3D content. As of the starting of this campaign, the graphics in the game are psuedo-3D built from clever visual tricks on strictly 2D objects and shapes, so the visual fidelity from this first trailer to completion will only improve while staying true to the graphical style, but these graphical improvements will not be too excessive to be prohibitive against lower end computers. In the more technical sense, your support and funding will allow StereoRem to utilize the OpenGL2 API (or OpenGL2 and above), while being written in Java and deploying OpenGL also offers the benefit of StereoRem having a wide variety of compatibility across Windows, Mac and Linux setups for maintaining an intense 60 frames per second!A few example renders of what 3D might offer object detail within StereoRem: a minimalist (though not low quality) approach to models relying instead on fantastic and exciting colors best enjoyed through motion.Estimated completion date may come before January, but in the event it takes longer for whatever reason, you will be well notified in advance. In a case of funding being well exceeded and any stretch goals being implemented, that may be one reason to account for a later-than-sooner delivery date.My hopes are that when you finally do get to play StereoRem, you'll want to play it loud About Reward TiersIf you plan to support StereoRem, please first click on one of the reward tiers listed to the right! This will help keep track of who should be receiving which reward, otherwise the free write-in amount at the top of the page will not be attributed with a reward tier. I will do my best to get in contact with anyone who seemingly submits a funding but forgets to choose a perk, however IndieGoGo is all automatically setup to track this stuff if you first choose a perk to the right to decide your reward!If you'd like to support more than just a reward tier, again first choose a reward tier to the right and after that has completed, feel free to use the write-in amount at the top of the page with the ""Back it"" button. About fundsThe goal of $2,800 will afford me a new workstation and a little spending cash as I develop StereoRem. If funds are met right on the money, $300 immediately goes towards processing fees, leaving $2,400-$2,500 as the main take away. Of that, $100 will go towards a Steam submission to have StereoRem published on Steam Direct when it's finished. I'm looking to spend up to $1,000 on a new workstation and any extra appliances it may need, leaving me with about a grand and some change to afford basics for living that may be stretched out up to January 2018 while developing StereoRem. Not much if any of the funds will be needed for licensing fees as I'm writing most of the code myself or using free use libraries for sound and visuals (see OpenGL). So with fees in mind along with the Goals of improving StereoRem, I'm confident that $2,800 is a good price to settle on. Given the nature of these fees and the cost of a new workstation, I've elected to use the Fixed Funding option on Indiegogo as StereoRem will not be abled to reach it's development milestones without the aforementioned costs an otherwise Flexible Funding goal could fail to meet. About Me (and About Music)I'm just a 28 year old guy living in Reno, Nevada. I've been a hobbyist musician most of my life with a primary interest in video game and electronic music, and for a long time have always wanted to make my own games. To hear some of my past music, you can find it on my bandcamp page. However, this stuff is not necessarily indicative of the newer music in my upcoming album which will be featured for StereoRem, which attempts for a more goodfeel vibe while using vocal samples, though via the nature of StereoRem being a game I've decided to also make some songs that would fit a more intense experience conducive to the fast paced video game I'm designing StereoRem to be.Click here to listen to a few short cuts of some of the songs featured in StereoRem. About YouYou're pretty cool if you're interested in StereoRem. About Anything ElseFeel free to ask me any question regarding StereoRem using IndieGoGo's ask feature provided at the top of this page, or feel free to ask me over here on tumblr.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>The Smartbike is an open source cycling virtual reality video game, that you can play with your own bicycle. It comes with the needed hardware that you can adapt to your own bycicle to enjoy a realistic cycling experience through a variety of landscapes, without the need of leaving home. You just need a computer to run the video game, and the game-controller is your own bicycle! </p>
<p>It is a good way to stay fit, entertain yourself and take good care of your health. The Smartbike monitors the real speed of the bicycle, the movements of the handlebar, your heart rate and the calories you are burning, all in real time! This makes the gameplay experience unique and staggering!</p>

<p><span> </span></p>
<h1>The Smartbike is infinitely customizable</h1>
<p>We value a project's flexibility and portability, thus we have decided to release the code and schematic diagrams as open source under the General Pubic License. <em>Anyone can make a game for the Smartbike:</em> you will be able to design and program your own stages or video games with the game and rendering engine of your choice, then interface them to the smartbike. </p>
<p>For non-programmers, we will be updating our download page on our website with updates, game stages and new games that can be adapted to the smartbike. <strong>Also, we will be letting our users share their smartbike games on our website, so others can download third-party software for the Smartbike.</strong> </p>
<p>Some examples of future updates:</p>
<ul>

<h1><strong>How it works</strong></h1>
<p><strong><img alt=""how it works"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.intelsath.com/smartbike/indiegogo/diagram.png"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p>The Smartbike consists of both hardware and software that interacts with the virtual and the real world. The bike itself, is the game controller needed to interact with the virtual world. You can use your own bicycle and make it stationary, or use your own spin-bike.</p>
<p>The steps to begin using the Smartbike virtual trainer is as followed: </p>
<ul>
<li>Install the software on your PC. Download it for free from our website (it's open source!).</li>
<li>Mount your bicycle to the Smartbike's stand to make it stationary. (Or use a spin-bike)</li>
<li>Mount the electronic circuit to the handlebar to read its direction (works with accelerometers and gyrosensors), and the user's heart-rate (comes with the wrist band: smart-pulse-band).</li>
<li>Connect the USB cable of the Smartbike's stand to your computer and start playing!</li>
</ul><p><strong>How is the heart-rate monitored? </strong>We have developed a wrist-band you can wear (<strong><em><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQMEJ3PtyE"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Smart-pulse-band</a></em></strong>), which monitors your pulse by measuring the changes in the blood flow due to the heart rate. You can constantly keep track of the beats-per-minute (bpm) of your heart while using the virtual trainer! This is helpful as it lets you know if the effort you're putting on while playing, is not too way off your limits. </p>

<h1><strong>The goal</strong></h1>
<p><strong>A new type of modern gym that anyone can enjoy!</strong> Enjoying exercise seems impossible for many people, which is why they choose to not exercise whatsoever. The Smartbike is more than a video game, it is a new way to think about exercising. We want to bring this technology to modern gyms all over the world and make exercise enjoyable. An smart stationary bike is only the start of this possible trend for the fitness world, we want to keep working on this technology with many other workout machines and make exercise more fun for many people. </p>
<p>The realistic features of the Smartbike software will also let cyclists train for races, and let gamers enjoy a virtual cycling experience. There are similar technologies out there, but they are really expensive. We want to bring this technology as open source and keep it at a low cost!</p>
<h2><strong>The software</strong></h2>
<p>You can choose from a variety of cycling programs, whether it is to burn calories fast, or to do some light exercise. There are different levels of intensity for your workout you can choose from. If you choose a hard stage, (i.e a stage with lots of hills) it will be harder to pedal because the resistance of the bike will automatically adjust, and in overall you will exercise harder. If you choose to play in an easy stage, you can exercise at your pace.</p>

<p><img alt=""Stage 1"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.intelsath.com/smartbike/indiegogo/software-screenshot.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h1>Where we're at</h1>
<p>We have demonstrated that virtual reality enhances the gameplay experience of the user. The experience of the user while playing a video game with a more realistic interface, can become a valuable tool for cyclists, and offer an staggering entertainment for gamers. Our current prototype works on spin-bicycles (smartbike1.0 - the smartbike spin-bike trainer). We still need to port the hardware and software to non-stationary bicycles but we ran out of money, so this is why we need your support! </p>
<p>We have built the hardware that can be easily mounted on any bicycle's handlebar to monitor its position, the hardware that reads the bike's speed as well as the heart rate. Now it's just a matter of porting our technology to non-stationary bikes, send our current design of the trainer stand and the electronic circuits to a factory that will be manufacturing our hardware.</p>
<p><strong><img alt=""smartbike stand - makes any bike stationary"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.intelsath.com/smartbike/indiegogo/smartbikestand.png"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p>Since our goal is to make the Smartbike a really accessible solution for cyclists and gamers, we are also offering to our contributors the option of using our current prototype, the <strong>Smartbike spin-bike trainer</strong> (or Smartbike 1.0) with their own spin-bikes. </p>
<h3><strong><strong>Smartbike spin-bike trainer: You get to use your own spin-bike!</strong></strong></h3>
<p>If you choose this perk ($150 for the DIY kit and $250 for the full assembled hardware), we will be sending the hardware needed to be adapted on your spin-bike. Adapt the full-assembled electronic circuits to your spin-bike, and make it smart! </p>
<p><img alt=""smartbike spin bike trainer"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.intelsath.com/smartbike/indiegogo/project_image.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Send us the diameter of the wheel and we will design your own circular reflective sticker so you can paste it on the wheel, this will be used to measure the speed because this kit works with optical sensors. You can choose to cut the sticker to put it in pieces, or simply paste it as a whole, whatever that works best for you! <em><strong>Limitations: </strong>No handlebar motion is supported with this kit, this is because most spin-bikes lack of movable handlebars. We will send the software version designed for this kit, which doesn't requires moving the handlebar.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<h2><strong>Why do we need the money?</strong></h2>
<p>We need your help to bring the Smartbike to the market! We have developed the prototype and we have the manpower to complete this project. But we don't have unlimited resources, we need the money to keep refining the prototype, keep it affordable, and then manufacture our design. In fact, we could not keep improving our current prototype because we ran out of money. This is why we are asking for your support here at Indiegogo, because we still need to incorporate further design elements to take our current prototype ready for production, and send our designs to a factory that can manufacture the hardware.</p>
<p>Essentially we will be using the money to take the Smartbike from the prototype stage 1.0 to a final prototype that is ready to be manufactured. In short: <strong>1) </strong>Finish our prototype on non-stationary bikes (The Smartbike VR trainer) and<strong> 2)</strong> Manufacture the hardware.</p>
<p>This is what we will be adding to our prototype after we reach our goal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve our software by adding new features to the video game such as more challenge modes, and a more realistic interface.</li>
<li>Add gyro-sensors and possibly magnetometers to the handlebar's circuit to improve its sensitivity. Current prototype works with 3-axis accelerometer.</li>
<li>Porting our current circuits to non-stationary bicycles.</li>
<li>Add a motorized roller to the trainer's stand, that will be used to control the friction (the resistance) of the rear wheel of the bicycle. The friction will be automatically adjusted with a microcontroller, depending on the terrain of the game.</li>
</ul><p>What we need to manufacture in order to ship the Smartbike to our backers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manufacture and assemble the electronic circuits on a PCB with its cases, and make them easy to mount on any bicycle. </li>
<li>Manufacture our design of the stand that will be used to make any bicycle stationary, and to control the rear wheel friction as well.</li>

<p>* The game being not to your liking</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There is a lot of unique mechanics in the game (like hierarchical military system, audiences, asymmetric gameplay), and let's face it, innovation not always work the first time as intended :) Some mechanics might turn out to be flawed, I might even be forced to remove some planet features (I hope not) from the final game if these turns out to be too flawed during tests. Definitely, it's not a traditional 4X where you design a ship, build it and send to kill enemy. It might be the best game you ever played, or one you don't like at all. Which one it will be, who knows :)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>* Delays</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Well, while there is no real danger of me not finishing the game (it's too far advanced and I'm doing it as a full time job and I have enough savings to survive till the end of dev cycle) there always is a possibility of traditional delays. From my experience I usually exceed my time budget 3 times (the game was planned to be made in 6 months, which I extended and in December it will be 18 months total, so that's just about right based on my previous projects :)). Of course I will aim to finish it a bit earlier. Anyway, it would drive my crazy if I were to fail to deliver it during 2015.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>* Some assets being inferior (gfx, music, sound, etc)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Depending on how much money I can raise I might need to make some tough decision about non core (other than code) assets. Fortunatelly, these can be improved after release (basicly it's only an issue of money).</p>

<p>Q: Why only $3,000? You surely can't make a game *that* cheap?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A: I don't need to cover all the costs via crowdfunding, also I don't live in a super rich country (so $3k for you is like $9k for me). I just need the money for the early-mid stage of development. Also, I'm not doing the crowdfunding for the sake of money only, I also want to get in touch of the fans of the game (I *LOVE* reading players feedback &amp; comments), get more testers, maybe find some volunteers that would help me with some easier things.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: Will there be a Mac/Linux version?</p>
<p>A: Maybe. I don't want to promise anything, but personally, I would be surprised if there was not such version eventually (the game does not use any Windows only components or anything). But not at the beginning, I need a peaceful &amp; quiet time (and one platform only to worry about) during development. Note the prototype works flawlessy on WinE.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: Will there be a mobile/tablet version?</p>
<p>A: No. The game was designed for desktop (heavy use of tooltips, big screen, right mouse button), it would not be possible I'm afraid.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: Will there be any Expansions/DLCs? What's your policy on these?</p>
<p>A: I hope so. Generally, I plan to include things that ""make the game better without increasing complexity"" in the core game and put things that ""make the game different/more complex"" in expansions (maybe also some crazy cosmetic DLC like ""all imperial officials are cute catgirls"" if players request it, but myself I don't plan it :)). Like I have alternative concepts for some mechanics or I was thinking of making some complex versions of mechanics and was afraid it would make the game too confusing to the player (these are ideal to go to an expansion). The premise is that an expansion is optional and you can *always* disable an expansion (or even a part of it you don't like). I definitely won't go the ""expansion is a patch that fix broken things"" route as some companies do :)</p>

 UPDATE (2015.12):The game progressess, slowly but steadily :) We are at the ALPHA stage now.I recommend to subscribe to this topic (if you use Steam):  http://steamcommunity.com/groups/pocketspaceempire/discussions/1/496881136907525136/
UPDATE:Prototype v0.10, v0.11, v0.12, v0.14, v0.15 released.UPDATE:Well, by now it's quite obvious the crowdfunding will fail (unfortunately, I have no cancel button so we need to wait it out). What does it mean? It means I will make the game anyway (got a lot of positive feedback along the way, the game was greenlit, etc) but will need to be extra careful with money :) The money you backed with will be returned to you (or it was not charged yet, I don't remember how it exactly worked, anyway you keep the money). But to not make your wallet too overbloated I have set up a Pre-order & EarlyAccess instead :) By the way, I just finished and uploaded the EarlyAccess version (rough, not really playable, totally unbalanced but it should give you some fun if you one of the people who like playing with unfinished things).
To preorder the game or get EarlyAccess go here: www.pocketspaceempire.com 
 I would like to thank all people who were participating in the crowdfunding. Even through it failed, I gathered valuable information along the way, so I would not say it was a waste of time, it was helpful. I also urge you to keep in touch with me (mailing list, steam group, twitter/facebook, anything you like) and observe the progress.  I hope you will like the game I'm making, well, maybe not the current unfinished version but the final one :) Thanks!   Singleplayer, 4X, space empire builder, turn based. Core design choices:
1) You are the Emperor not a logistics officer (you appoint governors, admirals, crush rebels, grant audiences, fend assassination attempts, you do not move individual ships around, you do not build farms on a planet #183)
2) No micromanagement, epic scale, fast paced (you control hundreds of planets yet there is no micromanagement and the gameplay progress fast even at a late stage)
3) Asymmetric gameplay, aliens are truly alien (some see you as food, some are civilized), races are not born equal (tech level, power, etc), different scenarios with drastically different starting conditions (for example: ""you start with half galaxy under your control and need to fight rebels instead of aliens"")
- Asymmetric gameplay (aliens/AI play by different rules)- Races not created equal (minor/major races, civilized/primitive, big/small)- Audiences granted by you, the Emperor (event & mechanic based)- Assassination attempts, rebellions, coups, court politics, food testers, imperial palace guards- Governors, admirals, commodores, generals, colonels, imperial courtiers, ambassadors (some of them not loyal and most of them corrupted, yet you can't manage the Empire alone so you need those scoundrels)- Big galaxy but without micromanagement (abstracted, as the Emperor you don't build farms/factories or deal with individual ships)- Fast paced *end game* (more planets require only minimum additional attention)- Different scenarios (for example some allow you to start with 200 planet old empire and crush rebels instead of conquering aliens)- Hierarchical military system (fleets, squadrons, individual ships)- Separate fleet & army (with separate chain of command)- and more... :)

At the moment of writing I have a prototype: done most of the basic stuff (map, planets, aliens, production, taxes, etc), also a hierarchical military system works (fleet only, extremely simplified combat for now), research system (need polish and adding techs but it's quite cool already), bare bone audience (without events). The alien AI is primitive now and the game is unbalanced for now (but by the end of the campaign I should have it reasonably balanced I think).I plan to release the final game this year (2015).Development plan: During crowdfunding I plan to finish most/some basic features and afterwards release the prototype for Early Access backers only.

A: I don't need to cover all the costs via crowdfunding, also I don't live in a super rich country (so $3k for you is like $9k for me). I just need the money for the early-mid stage of development. Also, I'm not doing the crowdfunding for the sake of money only, I also want to get in touch of the fans of the game (I *LOVE* reading players feedback & comments), get more testers, maybe find some volunteers that would help me with some easier things.
 
Q: Will there be a Mac/Linux version?
A: Maybe. I don't want to promise anything, but personally, I would be surprised if there was not such version eventually (the game does not use any Windows only components or anything). But not at the beginning, I need a peaceful & quiet time (and one platform only to worry about) during development. Note the prototype works flawlessy on WinE.
 
Q: Will there be a mobile/tablet version?
A: No. The game was designed for desktop (heavy use of tooltips, big screen, right mouse button), it would not be possible I'm afraid.
 
Q: Will there be any Expansions/DLCs? What's your policy on these?
A: I hope so. Generally, I plan to include things that ""make the game better without increasing complexity"" in the core game and put things that ""make the game different/more complex"" in expansions (maybe also some crazy cosmetic DLC like ""all imperial officials are cute catgirls"" if players request it, but myself I don't plan it :)). Like I have alternative concepts for some mechanics or I was thinking of making some complex versions of mechanics and was afraid it would make the game too confusing to the player (these are ideal to go to an expansion). The premise is that an expansion is optional and you can *always* disable an expansion (or even a part of it you don't like). I definitely won't go the ""expansion is a patch that fix broken things"" route as some companies do :)",8.0,3,"1 Campaign

<p>
</p>
<p><b><i>Dungeon Tris</i></b>
non è un gioco molto costoso, lo sono però le spese di spedizione alle quali
andiamo incontro affrontando una campagna di <i>crowdfunding</i> a livello internazionale. Acquistare una singola
scatola può non essere conveniente, abbiamo quindi pensato di selezionare e
suddividere le aree di spedizione, ma anche di introdurre offerte volte a
minimizzare i costi di spedizione e a favorire i gruppi d’acquisto.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Pertanto Le
nostre offerte <i>“Best for Game Clubs”</i>
” e <i>“Best for Game Shops”</i> sono aperte
a tutti e potrebbero essere una soluzione ideale.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Acquistare più di una confezione vi
consentirà di avere una bellissima idea regalo sempre a portata di mano,
organizzare animati tornei con i vostri associati o essere il primo rivenditore
ad avere sugli scaffali la prima edizione del gioco che diventerà un sicuro
successo internazionale.</p>

</div></div>","Dungeon TRIS is an abstract tiles placement game
based on the classic “Tic-tac-toe”.
The purpose is to
compose the largest number of tic tac toe
with the tiles on which it’s indicated a numeric value and carry the highest score.
The players have also some action tiles that
influence the course of the game, so that the challanges can get more dynamic.
Round after round, the players can modify their
strategy deciding whether to collect points or hinder the opponent.
Dungeon TRIS is simple, intuitive and quick to
learn.
Game after game, it will give you and your
friends hours of fun.





Dungeon TRIS
Designed and written by Antonio Ciocca.
Genere: Abstract – Tiles placement.
Dependance on language: Absent – The colored
and numbered tiles are easily usable.
Impact of the luck factor: Very low - Partially
depending on the tiles drawing, it’s compensated by the strategy of the players.
Basic version: 2 players (expandable 3 - 4).
Age: 8+
Duration: about 45 min.
ATTENTION:
The products (game, tiles, t-shirts, pins ...) shown in the photographs are for prototypes. The fundraiser will allow us to achieve a better finished product.
Shipping policy and offers


Dungeon Tris is not very expensive, but, with a crowdfunding campaign at an
international level, we meet high shipping costs. Since it’s not so cheap to
buy one single box, we have thought to select and divide the shipping areas,
and to introduce offers aimed at minimising shipping costs and encouraging
buying groups..


Our offers “Best
for Game Clubs” and “Best for Game
Shops” are open to all and could be the best solution.


If you buy more boxes, you can have a unique gift idea
always close at hand and you can also arrange lively tournaments with your
associates. And, why not, you could be the first reseller to have the first
edition of the game on your shelves, a game that will be definitely  an international success.
Zone ""A"": Italy
Zone ""B"":  Austria, Belgium, Danmark, France, Germany, Holland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom
Zone ""C"":   Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, USA

D.T. Home Made Game –PDF version of Dungeon Tris





Dungeon Tris is a simple, balanced game whose dynamics allow the
development of different gaming strategies. It has also another special
feature: cardboard tiles!


Guided by the offers on the Web proposing PDF versions
of role plays, we have thought that also Dungeon Tris could be suitable for
this kind of edition.


You will have, then, the opportunity to buy the play
rules and the sheets with the pawn graphics and make a copy of the game at
home, in H.M.G. edition.


However, the main edition will be available as a box
version, with all what you need for four players challenges.






Support the official website of Dungeon Tris (Dungeon Tris Web Community).





We don’t want Dungeon Tris to be just a board
game, but a style of play. We have, then, thought to develop a website to host
the community of players.


The website will provide:



The
     possibility to download the play rules, even in different languages
The
     official tournaments dates, the High Scores and the score of each player
Publicity
     for groups and shops supporting the spread of Dungeon Tris

A sales
     area for the official Dungeon Tris merchandising
The
     development of the H.M.G. edition with the publication of new sheets for
     official pawns
The
     Dungeon Tris development in different versions (app for
     smartphone, tablet, PC game, etc.).









Partnership





We are interested in contacts and proposals by publishers,
willing to help us spread Dungeon Tris. Please, contact us on
the official game page (Section: Collaborations).

Dungeon TRIS  è un gioco astratto  di piazzamento delle tessere basato sul
classico “Tris” Lo scopo è quello di
comporre con le tessere su cui è indicato un valore numerico, il maggior numero
di tris così da realizzare con essi
il punteggio più alto. 
Per rendere più dinamiche
le sfide, i giocatori hanno a disposizione anche delle tessere azione, che
influenzano lo svolgimento della partita. 
Turno dopo turno,  i giocatori potranno modificare la loro
strategia decidendo se accumulare punti o intralciare l’avversario.
Dungeon TRIS è un gioco semplice,
intuitivo e veloce da imparare.
Partita dopo partita
regalerà a voi e ai vostri amici ore di divertimento.



Dungeon TRIS
Ideato e scritto da Antonio Ciocca.
Genere: Astratto –
Piazzamento tessere.
Dipendenza dalla lingua:
Assente - Le tessere, colorate e numerate, sono facilmente utilizzabili.
Incidenza del fattore
fortuna: Molto bassa – In parte dipendente dalla pesca delle tessere, è
compensata dalla strategia messa in atto dai giocatori.
Versione base: 2
giocatori (espandibile 3 - 4).
Età: 8+
Durata: 45 min. circa.
ATTENZIONE: 
I prodotti ( gioco, tessere, magliette, spille... ) mostrati nelle fotografie si riferiscono a prototipi. La raccolta fondi ci permetterà di realizzare un prodotto finito migliore.


Politiche
di spedizione e offerte


Dungeon Tris
non è un gioco molto costoso, lo sono però le spese di spedizione alle quali
andiamo incontro affrontando una campagna di crowdfunding a livello internazionale. Acquistare una singola
scatola può non essere conveniente, abbiamo quindi pensato di selezionare e
suddividere le aree di spedizione, ma anche di introdurre offerte volte a
minimizzare i costi di spedizione e a favorire i gruppi d’acquisto.


Pertanto Le
nostre offerte “Best for Game Clubs”
” e “Best for Game Shops” sono aperte
a tutti e potrebbero essere una soluzione ideale.


Acquistare più di una confezione vi
consentirà di avere una bellissima idea regalo sempre a portata di mano,
organizzare animati tornei con i vostri associati o essere il primo rivenditore
ad avere sugli scaffali la prima edizione del gioco che diventerà un sicuro
successo internazionale.
Per l'Italia si dovrà considerare la zona di spedizione ""A"".



D.T.
Home Made Game – la versione PDF di Dungeon
Tris





Dungeon Tris
è un gioco semplice, bilanciato e con una meccanica che permette lo sviluppo di
differenti strategie di gioco. Ha anche un’altra caratteristica particolare:
utilizza pedine in cartoncino!


Ispirandoci alle offerte presenti in
rete, che propongono versioni PDF dei giochi di ruolo, abbiamo pensato che
anche Dungeon Tris, viste le sue caratteristiche, potesse adattarsi a
questo tipo di edizione.


Avrete quindi la possibilità di
acquistare il regolamento ed i fogli con le grafiche delle pedine e di produrvi
in casa la vostra copia del gioco in edizione H.M.G. 


L’edizione principale sarà comunque la
versione in scatola, contenente tutto il necessario per supportare le sfide tra
quattro giocatori.






Sostieni
il sito ufficiale di Dungeon Tris
(Dungeon Tris Web Community).





Non vogliamo che Dungeon Tris sia soltanto
un gioco in scatola, ma uno stile di gioco; abbiamo quindi pensato di
sviluppare un sito web che possa ospitare la comunità dei giocatori.


Il sito prevederà:



La possibilità di scaricare il
     regolamento di gioco, anche in lingue diverse da quella contenuta
     nell’edizione base.
La pubblicazione delle date dei
     tornei ufficiali, delle classifiche e dei punteggi realizzati dai
     partecipanti.
La pubblicità alle associazioni e
     ai negozi che sosterranno la diffusione di Dungeon Tris.

Un’area di vendita del
     merchandising ufficiale di Dungeon Tris.

Lo sviluppo dell’edizione H.M.G.
     con la pubblicazione di nuovi fogli pedine ufficiali.
Lo sviluppo di Dungeon
     Tris in differenti versioni (applicazioni per smartphone, tablet,
     PC game, etc.).

<p>Cricket Heroes is more or less feature complete, bar a few bug fixes and balance issues. We've had excellent feedback from the community regarding the gameplay and we are now heading into the final stages of development. However - there's been mainly negative feedback with regards to the graphics. While the animation is fluid, the models lack detail and the topology could be improved. The 3D models were made by Buko Studios and I think they've managed to do an excellent job given my tight budget.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In light of this, we need approximately $5000 for the following upgrades:</p>
<ul>
<li>improve the player 3D models</li>
<li>add support for differently sized/shaped head, torso and legs</li>

Players would leave their controllers behind at these tournaments and as an organizer it would be a pain to figure out who the controller belongs to.

CoverCube is an accessory for 1st party Nintendo GameCube controller ports. I came up with the idea when I was organizing Super Smash Bros. tournaments in Boulder, CO. Players would leave their controllers behind at these tournaments and as an organizer it would be a pain to figure out who the controller belongs to. With CoverCube on it makes it easier to identify who’s controller it is.                     We have gone through several iterations of CoverCube to get to our final retail version.                                    At first, when developing CoverCube we didn't take into consideration the curvature of the ports on the Nintendo GameCube console. Our final retail version takes into consideration ALL of Nintendo's compatible GameCube controller ports.                                                                                              We were lucky enough to team up with EndgameTV at Flatiron 3 where we showcased CoverCube to the public. Players were able to check out the product for the very first time while giving us feedback on it. 


                                                     

 

 
We are excited to partner up with CLASH Tournaments for Super Smash Bros. tournament SMASHADELPHIA at Too Many Games this year (June 22nd-24th). 
 

 

 
 





 
 

 

 

We decided to work with American based manufacturer Xcentric to produce the final product. With high quality plastic injection molds we knew they were a prefect fit for CoverCubes.

<p>The Coliseum is the competitive soul of Polygon Wars, this feature is available since the begining of the game. The Coliseum is based on a very simple principle, each time you win a battle in here, you get an amount of HonorCoins, this amount will be higher if it is the first time you have won that Colisseum's level. The quantity of HonorCoins that you have will be the score in the worldwide ranking and also it gives you the chance to unlock or to hire new heroes.</p>

<p><b>Yes,
</b>our desire is that anyone can play the game and decide if it worth the price, but we don’t want to create a <b>Pay-to-win </b>game<b>.
</b>The
way we have chosen to manage this issue is as follows:</p>

Only two kind of coins:<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/578390/files/20140514002123-amebacoin.png?1400052083"" src="""" style=""""/> AmebaCoins: they <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">can be earned winning battles in campaign

This coin can not be purchased.</p></li>
<li>
<p></p>
<p>The
movements on the map are limited, and they are recharged by time. The
player can spend AmebaCoins to recharge those movements.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><p>The number of consecutive times you can enter the coliseum is limited and also it is recharged with time. The player can immediately buy tickets for the Coliseum with AmebaCoins.<br/><br/><font color=""#6a6a6a"">It seems that
this is a Pay-to-Win so far, isn´t it. As players before developers, we hate this model, so we want to offer the opportunity to buy the campaign and the competitive part to the players who want to have the opportunity to squeeze the game. These purchases would be:</font></p></li>
<li><p> <b>Coliseum VIP
access</b>: Forget about waiting to enter the Coliseum. Enter in battles
whenever you want, either to obtain the glory, train your hero, or get new
champions.<br/></p></li>
<li>
<p></p>
<p><b>Adventurer:
</b>the annoying energy bar is over. Travel the Polyworld
freely to enjoy the battles and history without the waiting.</p>

Han comenzado a pedir tributos descabellados a las pequeñas aldeas de polígonos menores, pero al parecer, su demencia no ha hecho más que comenzar... un comunicado real ha exigido a las aldeas que entreguen en la capital el 50% de los niños censados en cada región en el plazo de una semana, de lo contrario el peso de la corona caerá sobre todos y cada uno de los habitantes.</span></p>Como líder de tu aldea pides ayuda a 3 héroes, viejos amigos de tu padre, para pedirles ayuda y consejo.

Ahora la decisión es tuya, elige al héroe que te acompañará en la lucha por la supervivencia y la búsqueda de la libertad...<p><br/></p>

<p><span>Polygon Wars es un juego de acción y estrategia 2D en el que deberás combinar tu habilidad como estratega en batalla con la inteligencia para invertir tu botín a la hora de mejorar tu aldea. ¡Demuestra tu destreza como líder en el coliseo y podrás conseguir cantidad de nuevos héroes que incorporar a tu causa!</span></p>
<p>En Poligon Wars tienes dos objetivos principales: Por un lado te verás envuelto en una historia épica, en la que estarás forzado a liderar una pequeña y pacífica aldea de polígonos en una marcha desesperada, el la que será crucial conseguir la ayuda de una gran variedad de héroes. Por otro lado, podrás poner a prueba tu liderazgo, entrenar a tus héroes y conseguir a nuevos campeones para tus filas labrándote un nombre en las duras arenas del coliseo.</p>
<p>Mantén el control sobre el campo de batalla y por tanto sobre los recursos, decidiendo qué unidades usar en cada momento y cuando ordenar a tus héroes saltar al campo de batalla para detener una horda de enemigos o lanzar una carga letal contra la base enemiga.</p>

Cada guerrero que alcance la base enemiga reducirá los puntos de vida de ésta en 1, mientras que los héroes causan un daño mayor.

<p><span>La corriente general en el Polimundo dice que los héroes son polígonos bendecidos por el Gran Dibujante aunque cada vez hay más voces que aseguran que simplemente sus líneas siguieron unas pautas distintas a lo largo del tiempo para llegar, por casualidad, a una forma similar a la del resto de polígonos. Hay incluso quien piensa que el realidad los héroes llegaron desde un plano distinto hace tanto tiempo que lo han olvidado. Los héroes pueden ser debilitados y derrotados, pero no pueden morir. Si un héroe es derrotado durante la batalla, o alcanza la base enemiga, volverá a la propia base para recuperarse (la velocidad de recuperación dependerá de nuestro nivel de enfermería). Una vez sus heridas hayan sanado por completo podrá volver a la batalla.</span></p>Cada héroe tiene un conjunto de habilidades único y unas estadísticas base distintas que van mejorando conforme sube de nivel. Actualmente las habilidades disponibles son las siguientes:<br/><p></p>

The almighty circles, the masters of polygons, those who in the past ruled the world with wisdom and justice, seem to have fallen into madness. They have begun to ask for improper tributes to the small villages, but apparently, his madness has just started... A court letter demands the delivery of half the children of each village within a week, otherwise the crown's fist will fall on every one of the inhabitants.

As the village's leader you ask for help from three heroes, old friends of your father. A decision was made, two of the heroes will travel to different kingdom's places to gather further information and the last one will remain in the village just to help in its defense. The Polyworld is in danger and you have the village trust to guide them. Surrender or give in is not an option. Now the choice is yours, choose your favorite hero to fight together in this struggle for survival and the freedom.
Play the demo in our website!!Try Polygon Wars*It’s not the final version.Polygon Wars is a 2D action/strategy game where you should use some skills as your battle strategy and your intelligence to consume the obtained resources to improve the village's buildings. New heroes will join your purpose whether, as the leader, your ability in the Arena is enough to impress them.
There are two main challenges in Polygon Wars:         - The main one is to lead your village to freedom. In this epic story, you will fight side by side with the greatest heroes of the Polyworld.         - The second challenge is The Colliseum, here you will fight against several enemies. New heroes could be recruited depending on your battle skills.
You will have the liberty of decide the units to use and when your heroes should appear in the battlefield to fight against a horde of enemies or launch a lethal attack to the enemy base and also, you should keep the control of your resources.The objetive in the battle is simple, attack the enemy base in order to consume its life points, but, be careful, keep in mind the life points of your army's base. Each time a warrior reaches a base, the base will lose one life point, if the warrior is a hero, the damage will be higher. Army's limit: this gauge grows up with every warrior we have in the battle field (heroes included). If the gauge is full, it means that we can’t use more units, if this happens we have to wait until one of our warriors reaches the enemy's base or dies in the battle, once a warrior does that, we can send new units to the battle. Health Bar: Shows the remaining health points of the base. Check Points: This gauge grows up every time we conquer a flag in the
battlefield. The more checkpoints we get more resources we gather. Recruits: The battle begins with this gauge full and it goes down each time
you send a unit into the battle (this is not affected using heroes). The recruit gauge will be
progressively increased until it reach the limit. Goods:  The battle begins with an amount of resources, this amount is based on the level
of your structures and it is increased over time, depending on the levels of your
village and the checkpoints you have conquered in the battle. You will need those resources to send soldiers
into the battleground. Heroes: If the hero is not fighting the green bar under his/her icon
shows how long we have wait until he can be summoned. If the hero is in battlefield, this bar
shows his/her health points.In addition to those elements, the battle's GUI has buttons to convocate different battle units.“The triangles are
hyperactive, cheerful and teasers... if you want some peace in your life you should look for other neighbors”“It is easier to
imagine a third dimension than make a square change his mind”“A smart pentagon always find the way to solve
any problem… hitting it”“If you want to see a circle happy, praise his infinite sides, if you want to see him angry, ask him where he has left his edges”All weapons, except the stick, can be enhanced in the blacksmith up to level 3, which slightly increases its cost and substantially its performance.Damage types
Normal: it provides no special effect.

Slash: it has the change to injure the enemy, reducing his/her speed by 50%.


Piercing: it has the chance of make damage to other enemy in the same row.




Impact: It ignores the shield’s damage
reduction.




Magic: it can not be avoided.


In the Polyworld it is said that Heroes are polygons blessed by the Great Artist but, nowadays, there are more and more voices saying that their lines followed a different patterns along the time and they got, by chance, a similar shape to the other polygons. There are others that say that the heroes came from a different dimension so long time ago and currently they have forgotten their born place. Heroes can be weakened and defeated, but they can not die. If a hero is defeated in the battlefield or reaches the enemy's base, he/she will come back to his/her base to recover the health points (the recovery speed depends on the infirmary's level). Once his/her injuries are healed, the hero can return to the battle.

Each hero has a unique set of skills and a different stats in his/her first level that can be improved according to the hero's level. The current available skills are:The followings are some
of the heroes that we can find in the game:In the Polyworld there are many more heroes, some of them are unknown, others that we don’t want to unveil. In any case, with your support, we will offer lots of them.In the village screen, we can manage our army, in this screen there are several buildings that we can evolve to improve our military army. In the beginning we can interact with four buildings.Village and Camp: The village provides resources. Raising the village's level increases the resources generated in the same time, allowing you to use more soldiers in battle. The size of the village also influences the number of recruits that are generated. Raising the camp's level increases the base's health points and the limit of recruits.Weaponsmith: Increasing the level of the weaponsmith allows you to unlock weapons with that level. There are three levels of weaponsmith, and hence, three levels of each type of weapon. The weapons' level depends on the weaponsmith's level.Infirmary: The higher infirmary's level is, the sooner your heroes are healed and therefore they can return to the battleground earlier. There are three levels of infirmary.War College: Raising the levels of the war college increases the limit of your army, raising the number of soldiers that you can send into battle..Each region will have a camp-out and several locations, in first place they are owned by the enemies, they can be of two types: standard  and bases The bases, while they are not conquered, they reconquer the contiguous places. Because of that, until all the bases of the region are conquered the region can not be conquered. When you win a battle you will get a amount of ameba coins  , this amount depends on the battle's difficulty, those coins can be used to improved your army or to fill up the movements.This is an example of region
1:Region 2:Region 3:The world map give you the possibility of travel between
regions. This possibility will be available as soon as a region is conquered. Once all the bases
in a region are conquered, it is possible to travel to an adjacent location. 






The Coliseum is the competitive soul of Polygon Wars, this feature is available since the begining of the game. The Coliseum is based on a very simple principle, each time you win a battle in here, you get an amount of HonorCoins, this amount will be higher if it is the first time you have won that Colisseum's level. The quantity of HonorCoins that you have will be the score in the worldwide ranking and also it gives you the chance to unlock or to hire new heroes.

our desire is that anyone can play the game and decide if it worth the price, but we don’t want to create a Pay-to-win game.
The
way we have chosen to manage this issue is as follows:

Only two kind of coins:


 AmebaCoins: they can be earned winning battles in campaign
mode. They can be used to make improvements in the village. You can purchase this kind of coins with real money.
 HonorCoins: You earn this type of coin winning coliseum battles.These coins establish your position in the global rank and, also, with these coins new heroes can be unlocked. This coin can not be purchased.


The
movements on the map are limited, and they are recharged by time. The
player can spend AmebaCoins to recharge those movements.


The number of consecutive times you can enter the coliseum is limited and also it is recharged with time. The player can immediately buy tickets for the Coliseum with AmebaCoins.It seems that
this is a Pay-to-Win so far, isn´t it. As players before developers, we hate this model, so we want to offer the opportunity to buy the campaign and the competitive part to the players who want to have the opportunity to squeeze the game. These purchases would be:
 Coliseum VIP
access: Forget about waiting to enter the Coliseum. Enter in battles
whenever you want, either to obtain the glory, train your hero, or get new
champions.


Adventurer:
the annoying energy bar is over. Travel the Polyworld
freely to enjoy the battles and history without the waiting.







The game is being
developed for iOS and Android mobile devices. We have also planned to develop
it for PC, Linux and MAC but that will be if the campaign achieves the
objective of 15000 €.

We invest them in:



50% development time.

Los poderosos círculos, señores de todos los polígonos y que hasta ahora habían dirigido el polimundo con sabiduría y justicia parecen haber enloquecido. Han comenzado a pedir tributos descabellados a las pequeñas aldeas de polígonos menores, pero al parecer, su demencia no ha hecho más que comenzar... un comunicado real ha exigido a las aldeas que entreguen en la capital el 50% de los niños censados en cada región en el plazo de una semana, de lo contrario el peso de la corona caerá sobre todos y cada uno de los habitantes.Como líder de tu aldea pides ayuda a 3 héroes, viejos amigos de tu padre, para pedirles ayuda y consejo. Unidos en asamblea decidís que 2 de ellos viajarán a distintos puntos del reino para recabar más información y otro se quedará para ayudarte en la defensa de tu aldea, El Polimundo se tambalea y tu pueblo confía en tí para que les guíes, la rendición no es una opción. Ahora la decisión es tuya, elige al héroe que te acompañará en la lucha por la supervivencia y la búsqueda de la libertad...

*Los gráficos e interfaces no son los definitivos.






Polygon Wars es un juego de acción y estrategia 2D en el que deberás combinar tu habilidad como estratega en batalla con la inteligencia para invertir tu botín a la hora de mejorar tu aldea. ¡Demuestra tu destreza como líder en el coliseo y podrás conseguir cantidad de nuevos héroes que incorporar a tu causa!
En Poligon Wars tienes dos objetivos principales: Por un lado te verás envuelto en una historia épica, en la que estarás forzado a liderar una pequeña y pacífica aldea de polígonos en una marcha desesperada, el la que será crucial conseguir la ayuda de una gran variedad de héroes. Por otro lado, podrás poner a prueba tu liderazgo, entrenar a tus héroes y conseguir a nuevos campeones para tus filas labrándote un nombre en las duras arenas del coliseo.
Mantén el control sobre el campo de batalla y por tanto sobre los recursos, decidiendo qué unidades usar en cada momento y cuando ordenar a tus héroes saltar al campo de batalla para detener una horda de enemigos o lanzar una carga letal contra la base enemiga.




El objetivo de la batalla es tan simple conseguir llevar a cero los puntos de vida de la base enemiga antes de que el enemigo acabe con tu base. Cada guerrero que alcance la base enemiga reducirá los puntos de vida de ésta en 1, mientras que los héroes causan un daño mayor. La interfaz de batalla muestra la siguiente información:







 Límite de ejército : Este indicador aumenta con cada guerrero que tenemos en el campo de batalla (héroes incluidos). Si la barra está llena significa que no podemos comandar más unidades, por lo que tendremos que esperar hasta que una de nuestras unidades muera o alcance la base enemiga para poder sacar otro guerrero.


 Barra de salud : Indica la salud de la base.


 Puntos de control: Este indicador aumenta cada vez que conquistamos una de las 6 banderas del campo de batalla. Cuantos más puntos de control tengamos más recursos conseguiremos.


 Reclutas: Comienzas la batalla con este indicador al máximo y se reduce cada vez que llamas a batalla a una unidad (heroes no incluidos). El contador de reclutas se irá incrementando progresivamente cada cierto tiempo hasta llegar al límite.


 Recursos: Se comienza la batalla con una cantidad de recursos que depende del nivel de tus estructuras y se va incrementando a lo largo de tiempo el función del nivel de tu aldea y de los puntos de control conquistados. Los recursos son necesarios para llamar a los reclutas al campo de batalla.(El herrero tiene que pagar proveedores...)


 Heroes: Si el héroe no está en batalla la barra verde bajo su icono indica cuanto le falta para poder ser invocado. Si está en batalla la barra bajo el icono representa sus puntos de salud.

Aparte de los elementos informativos, la interfaz de batalla cuenta por supuesto con los botones para llamar a batalla a las distintas unidades.









“Los triángulos son hiperactivos, alegres y bromistas… si quieres algo de paz en tu vida buscate otros vecinos”



“Es más fácil imaginar una tercera dimensión que hacer cambiar de idea a un cuadrado”


“Un pentágono inteligente siempre encontrará la manera de solucionar un problema a golpes”





“Si quieres ver a un círculo feliz, elogia sus infinitos lados, si quieres verlo enfadado, pregúntale dónde se ha dejado las aristas”




Todas las armas, salvo la porra, pueden ser mejoradas en el herrero hasta nivel 3, lo que aumenta levemente su coste y sustancialmente su rendimiento.






Tipos de daño



Normal: Ningún efecto.

Corte: Tiene probabilidad de causar lisiadura, lo que reduce la velocidad de movimiento del enemigo un 50%.
Penetración: Tiene probabilidad de hacer daño a un segundo enemigo.
Impacto: Ignora la reducción de daño de los escudos.
Mágico: No puede ser esquivado.





La corriente general en el Polimundo dice que los héroes son polígonos bendecidos por el Gran Dibujante aunque cada vez hay más voces que aseguran que simplemente sus líneas siguieron unas pautas distintas a lo largo del tiempo para llegar, por casualidad, a una forma similar a la del resto de polígonos. Hay incluso quien piensa que el realidad los héroes llegaron desde un plano distinto hace tanto tiempo que lo han olvidado. Los héroes pueden ser debilitados y derrotados, pero no pueden morir. Si un héroe es derrotado durante la batalla, o alcanza la base enemiga, volverá a la propia base para recuperarse (la velocidad de recuperación dependerá de nuestro nivel de enfermería). Una vez sus heridas hayan sanado por completo podrá volver a la batalla.Cada héroe tiene un conjunto de habilidades único y unas estadísticas base distintas que van mejorando conforme sube de nivel. Actualmente las habilidades disponibles son las siguientes:


Aquí tenéis una muestra de los héroes que podremos encontrar en el juego:








En el Polimundo hay muchos más heroes, a algunos aún no los conocemos, y otros no queremos que los conozcáis aún. En cualquier caso, con vuestro apoyo, esperamos poder ofreceros un elenco cada vez mayor de posibilidades.







Fuera de la pantalla de batalla podremos administrar nuestro ejército en la pantalla de aldea. En la aldea hay varias edificaciones predefinidas  que podemos evolucionar para mejorar nuestro ejército. En principio podemos interactuar con 4 construcciones.

Aldea y Campamento: La aldea provee los recursos, subir el nivel de aldea incrementa los recursos que se generan en función del tiempo, lo que permite usar más unidades equipadas en batalla. El tamaño de la aldea también influye en la cantidad de reclutas que se generan.Aumentar el nivel de campamento aumenta los puntos de vida de la base así como el límite de reclutas(mencionado en el apartado Interfaz).






Armero: Subir un nivel de armero te permite desbloquear las armas hasta ese nivel. Hay 3 niveles de Armero, y por lo tanto 3 niveles de cada tipo de arma, para llevar un arma a un nivel hay que tener el armero a ese nivel.





Enfermería: El nivel de médico más alto hace que tu héroe pueda ser curado más rápido, y por consiguiente, volver antes a la batalla tras ser derrotado. Hay 3 niveles de enfermería.





Escuela de guerra: Aumentar el nivel de la escuela de guerra aumenta el valor del límite de ejército (mencionado en el concepto de pantalla de juego). Lo que aumenta el número de guerreros que puedes tener simultáneamente en el campo de batalla








Cada región tendrá un campamento de salida y varias localizaciones, en principio enemigas, que podrán ser de 2 tipos : normales   y bases Las bases, mientras no se conquisten, reconquistan periódicamente las localizaciones contiguas a ellas, de forma que es imposible conquistar completamente una región hasta que no se han conquistado las bases enemigas. Con la victoria en cada batalla conseguirás una cantidad de amebaCoins , dependiendo de la dificultad, que podrás invertir en mejorar tu ejército o comprar  movimientos.
Aquí se muestra un ejemplo de la región 1:


Región 2:

Región 3:




El mapa del mundo te permite viajar entre regiones. Para poder usar esta función se debe conquistar una región. Una vez conquistadas todas las bases enemigas de una región( no es necesario conquistar todas la localizaciones) se puede viajar a una región contigua.





El coliseo es el alma competitiva de Polygon Wars. Al comenzar el juego será posible entrar en el coliseo. El coliseo se basa en un principio muy simple, cada vez que ganas una batalla recibes una cantidad de HonorCoins ,que tendrá una bonificación si es la primera vez que ganas ese nivel, y desbloqueas el siguiente nivel.La cantidad de HonorCoins conseguidas serán tu puntuación en el ranking mundial, además de permitirte desbloquear nuevos heroes.



Sí, queremos que cualquiera pueda probar el juego antes de decidir si merece la pena gastar dinero en él, pero NO queremos que una vez lo decida el juego se convierta en un Pay-to-Win. La forma en que hemos decidido abordar este tema es la siguiente:
Sólo 2 monedas:



 AmebaCoins: se consiguen al ganar batallas en el modo campaña y se usan para realizar mejoras en la aldea. Pueden ser compradas.


 HonorCoins: se consiguen al ganar batallas en el coliseo y determinan tu ranking mundial. Sirven para desbloquear nuevos heroes. No se pueden comprar.


Las limitaciones del usuario Free serán principalmente 2:

Los movimientos en el mapa serán limitados, y se irán recargando en el tiempo. El jugador podrá recargar inmediatamente esos movimientos con AmebaCoins.
La cantidad de veces consecutivas que puedes entrar al coliseo es limitada y también se racarga en el tiempo. El jugador podrá recargar inmediatamente esos movimientos con AmebaCoins.

Hasta aquí todo parece indicar que esto es un Pay-to-Win. Como jugadores antes que desarrolladores odiamos este modelo, así que queremos ofrecer la posibilidad de comprar tanto la campaña como la parte competitiva a los jugadores que queráis sacarle todo el partido al juego. Estas compras serían:

 Pase VIP Coliseo: Olvídate de esperar para entrar en el coliseo. Participa en las batallas siempre que lo desees, ya sea para conseguir la gloria, entrenar a tus héroes, o conseguir nuevos campeones. 
Aventurero: Se acabó la molesta barra de energía. Recorre el Polimundo libremente para disfrutar de las batallas y la historia sin tener que esperar.

<h2>Rimelands - Turn-based RPG Goodness</h2>
<p>Rimelands: Hammer of Thor was originally released for iPhone on the beginning of September 2010 and went on to quickly gather a number of favorable reviews (the Metascore of the game being 8.9).</p>
<p>In essence, it’s a<strong> turn-based roleplaying game with very boardgame-like mechanics</strong>, inspired by games such as <strong>HeroQuest</strong> and <strong>Descent: Journeys in the Dark</strong>. </p>

<h2>
<img alt=""rose"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.rimelands.com/indiegogo/rimelands_rose_indiegogo.png"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>Story</h2>
<p>Rimelands is set in a <strong>steampunk world</strong> where mankind has recently re-emerged, after a thousand year long ice age, only to discover that magic has returned on Earth, and a mysterious beings called the Fae with it.</p>
<p style=""display: block;"">You play as Rose Cristo (though you get to change the first name), a young woman raised by her loving grandmother, as she accidentally stumbles onto an adventure that will change her life -- and the lives of those dear to her. </p>
<p style=""display: block;"">The story of Rimelands: Hammer of Thor is inspired by pulp adventures of old and thus bears more resemblance to <strong>Indiana Jones</strong> than to <strong>Lord of the Rings.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Rimelands: Hammer of Thor</strong> is a turn-based roleplaying game with dice-based combat. You and your enemies take turns to perform single actions (similiar to roguelike-games), outcomes of which are determined by rolls of dice, visible on the screen. You also have a limited number of opportunities to re-roll the dice, adding a new layer of tactical decisions to the rolls.</p>
<p>The game has<strong> three character paths</strong>, but no fixed classes so you can mix and match a character to your liking. Each path has unique talents that bring in a variety of strategies for you to utilize. </p>
<p style=""clear: both;""> Rimelands mixes randomly generated levels with pre-designed ones to provide variety for multiple playthroughs.</p>

<h2>Who are we?</h2>
<p>We are a small game studio located in Finland. Dicework Games was established about three years ago, but we both have industry experience on multiple projects before that. Our goal is to create games we love to play, regardless of their perceived commercial potential.</p>
<p><img alt=""Dicework Games"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.rimelands.com/indiegogo/dicework_indiegogo.png"" src="""" style=""display: block;"" title=""Developers""/></p>

<p> </p>
<h2>If the game’s already out, what do you need money for?</h2>
<p>Despite the critical success, a niche game like Rimelands is a hard sell on such a crowded platform like App Store. We’re collecting the money to fund a PC and Mac conversion of the game, so that people who don’t have iPhones or iPads can also enjoy it. But that’s not all, it’s also a total reimagining of the original, enhanced in multiple ways.</p>
<p>We have already completed remaking the interface and most of the basic things, so what's left is refining the game's content. The money will be used towards that goal, and if we pass the funding goal, to further refine and add content. In addition the content, we'll also be spending time on improving the level editor. </p>
<p> Funders will also be able to vote which kind of new content we'll add.</p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>How does the desktop version differ from the mobile one?</h2>
<p>First of all, the whole <strong>user interface</strong> has been remade to work better on larger screens and keyboard-mouse input.</p>
<p>Second, we have updated the game graphically to take advantage of the multiple times better graphic capabilities of the desktop hardware (though it will still work fine even on older computers).</p>
<p>We have also completely <strong>rewritten</strong> the <strong>story</strong> of the game, admittedly the weakest point of the original.</p>
<p>Last, but definitely not least, we will also include an <strong>easy-to-use level editor</strong> with the game, so you can create your own Rimelands adventures.</p>
<p><img alt=""Screenshot C"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.rimelands.com/indiegogo/rimelands_screenC_indiegogo.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Inventory UI""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What? A level editor?</h2>
<p>Yes. While it will not be 100% customizable  you will be able to make full functioning levels, complete with events and NPCs. The level editor allows WYSIWYG editing of levels, enemies, treasure and visuals (eg. lighting, effects). All the level data is stored in easily readable text format for additional moddability.</p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What will the funders get in exchange?</h2>
<p>Everyone who donates at least $10 will obviously get a copy of the game when it’s released, as well as a possibility to participate in the beta testing of the game. The beta includes an access to private forums, so you will be able to make comments and suggestions before the beta too.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Other ways to help</h2>
<p>If for some reason you can’t or don’t want to donate, you can also help in many ways:</p>

Rimelands - Turn-based RPG Goodness
Rimelands: Hammer of Thor was originally released for iPhone on the beginning of September 2010 and went on to quickly gather a number of favorable reviews (the Metascore of the game being 8.9).
In essence, it’s a turn-based roleplaying game with very boardgame-like mechanics, inspired by games such as HeroQuest and Descent: Journeys in the Dark. 

 

Story
Rimelands is set in a steampunk world where mankind has recently re-emerged, after a thousand year long ice age, only to discover that magic has returned on Earth, and a mysterious beings called the Fae with it.
You play as Rose Cristo (though you get to change the first name), a young woman raised by her loving grandmother, as she accidentally stumbles onto an adventure that will change her life -- and the lives of those dear to her. 
The story of Rimelands: Hammer of Thor is inspired by pulp adventures of old and thus bears more resemblance to Indiana Jones than to Lord of the Rings.


 

Rolling the Dice
Rimelands: Hammer of Thor is a turn-based roleplaying game with dice-based combat. You and your enemies take turns to perform single actions (similiar to roguelike-games), outcomes of which are determined by rolls of dice, visible on the screen. You also have a limited number of opportunities to re-roll the dice, adding a new layer of tactical decisions to the rolls.
The game has three character paths, but no fixed classes so you can mix and match a character to your liking. Each path has unique talents that bring in a variety of strategies for you to utilize. 
 Rimelands mixes randomly generated levels with pre-designed ones to provide variety for multiple playthroughs.
 
Who are we?
We are a small game studio located in Finland. Dicework Games was established about three years ago, but we both have industry experience on multiple projects before that. Our goal is to create games we love to play, regardless of their perceived commercial potential.

 
 
If the game’s already out, what do you need money for?
Despite the critical success, a niche game like Rimelands is a hard sell on such a crowded platform like App Store. We’re collecting the money to fund a PC and Mac conversion of the game, so that people who don’t have iPhones or iPads can also enjoy it. But that’s not all, it’s also a total reimagining of the original, enhanced in multiple ways.
We have already completed remaking the interface and most of the basic things, so what's left is refining the game's content. The money will be used towards that goal, and if we pass the funding goal, to further refine and add content. In addition the content, we'll also be spending time on improving the level editor. 
 Funders will also be able to vote which kind of new content we'll add.

 
 
How does the desktop version differ from the mobile one?
First of all, the whole user interface has been remade to work better on larger screens and keyboard-mouse input.
Second, we have updated the game graphically to take advantage of the multiple times better graphic capabilities of the desktop hardware (though it will still work fine even on older computers).
We have also completely rewritten the story of the game, admittedly the weakest point of the original.
Last, but definitely not least, we will also include an easy-to-use level editor with the game, so you can create your own Rimelands adventures.

 
 
What? A level editor?
Yes. While it will not be 100% customizable  you will be able to make full functioning levels, complete with events and NPCs. The level editor allows WYSIWYG editing of levels, enemies, treasure and visuals (eg. lighting, effects). All the level data is stored in easily readable text format for additional moddability.

 
 
What will the funders get in exchange?
Everyone who donates at least $10 will obviously get a copy of the game when it’s released, as well as a possibility to participate in the beta testing of the game. The beta includes an access to private forums, so you will be able to make comments and suggestions before the beta too.
 
Other ways to help
If for some reason you can’t or don’t want to donate, you can also help in many ways:
- Spread the word. The more people know about the game, the better.
- Buy the game for iOS. Every penny counts and all the money we get from the sales of the iOS game will be used to fund the desktop version.
- Recommend the iOS game to a friend. Even if you yourself don’t own an iOS device, you probably know someone who does.

<p>Producer Credit: This is a real producer credit that you can add to IMDb. Your contribution is significant! By contributing $500, you will be added to the advisory board and can play a meaningful and active advisory role in the production.

<h3>You don't need to claim a perk at all!</h3>
<p>If you aren't a gamer and don't know any gamers but would still like to contribute just because it looks like such a cool project, you don't need to claim a perk at all-simply contribute whatever amount you like! <strong>Contribute Today! </strong></p>
<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>
<h3>What do I Get for My Contribution?</h3>
<p>Well, first of all you get some really fun perks. But most importantly, <strong>you</strong> <strong>get an awesome new game!</strong> At every level of contribution you receive tons of game credits so you'll be able to play for free for a long, long time! How cool is that!? <strong>Contribute today! </strong></p>
<h3>Why Crowd Funding?</h3>
<p>There isn't much appetite for risk in the industry and most of the venture capital these days is being spent on mobile games. I'd love to see OOG! on every mobile device eventually but I believe the best platform for a social game is still on Facebook. So, I've decided to appeal directly to you, the fans for support. If you want to play OOG! on Facebook then please show your support here! The money is obviously important but your contribution is also an endorsement for our approach to social games. <strong>Please Contribute Today!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why Facebook?</h3>
<p> Facebook is the right place for OOG! I see Facebook reaching out to developers in interesting ways -especially when it comes to mobile integration. Facebook is still the best social network on the planet-by far. The potential audience for our game on Facebook is huge.The mobile space is very, very crowded  but there aren't many new games on Facebook right now so there is an an opportunity to gain some market share and find players hungry for fresh, new content.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""OOG! Dancers and Musicians. Collect em all!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/635590/pictures/full/20130127172810-OOG_Dancers_and_musicians_Indiegogo.png?1359336497"" src="""" style="""" title=""OOG! Dancers and Musicians""/></p>
<h3>Why a Caveman Theme?</h3>
<p>To me, this is the meat-eating, hunter/gatherer version of Pot Farm. But it's really the same thing - an awesome online party game. OOG! is another chance to get ""primal' with friends and share an immersive and entertaining game experience. It's like a virtual Burning Man -a chance for folks to share some free-form communal play, make collective art, burn rituals and dance their buns off.  The Caveman genre has been around for ever and is ripe for parody. So, why not! I think we'll have a lot of fun making this and hopefully, you'll have just as much fun playing the game.</p>
<h3>What Technology will You Use?</h3>
<p>We plan to build the game based on Unity which will allow us to move more easily to mobile if/when we reach that stage.</p>
<h3>What are Your Risks?</h3>
<p>Our first challenge will be on the tech/design side.I am not working with the same team that built the game engine for Pot Farm. So, I need to put a new tech team together to build this game. But I am completely confident that this is achievable. I've been in the industry a long time and know a lot of talented people that will jump at the opportunity to work with us and take this on!</p>
<p>Then of course, we might not come up with enough money here to go all the way and we'll need to find other investors and/or a publishing partner to finish and launch the game. But if you give us a solid vote of confidence here and enough money to get far into production, then the risk for other partners is reduced. So obviously, the more you can contribute, the better our chances for success! <strong>Contribute today!</strong></p>
<h3>Milestones</h3>
<p>*Important - 25-30% of all funds raised will be expensed for perks, shipping, Indiegogo fees and administration. For example, $50,000 funding milestone actually represents about $35,000 of production money.</p>
<p>$50,000 -If we achieve our base funding goal of $50,000 We'll build a working prototype of the game. The prototype will flesh out most of the core game mechanics, interface, point system and economy. Key features will include hunting,gathering, ritual building, fire, sacrifice, babies, gifting,art making and crafting, a few NPC characters including dancers and musicians.</p>
<p>$150,000 - If we achieve $150,000 in funding we will build a full Alpha version of the game. Alpha should be playable to about 25 levels but with minimal working features and placeholder content. The back end should support a modest closed test group of about 1000 players.</p>
<p>$300,000 - If we achieve $300,000 in funding we will build a full Beta game and  launch with a publishing partner. The Beta Launch should be stable with a balanced economy and full content to about 100 levels. The back end should be stable and scalable, supporting a potential 200,000 DAU and a 1 million+ player install base shortly after launch.</p>

Then of course, we might not come up with enough money here to go all the way and we'll need to find other investors and/or a publishing partner to finish and launch the game. But if you give us a solid vote of confidence here and enough money to get far into production, then the risk for other partners is reduced. So obviously, the more you can contribute, the better our chances for success! Contribute today!
Milestones
*Important - 25-30% of all funds raised will be expensed for perks, shipping, Indiegogo fees and administration. For example, $50,000 funding milestone actually represents about $35,000 of production money.
$50,000 -If we achieve our base funding goal of $50,000 We'll build a working prototype of the game. The prototype will flesh out most of the core game mechanics, interface, point system and economy. Key features will include hunting,gathering, ritual building, fire, sacrifice, babies, gifting,art making and crafting, a few NPC characters including dancers and musicians.
$150,000 - If we achieve $150,000 in funding we will build a full Alpha version of the game. Alpha should be playable to about 25 levels but with minimal working features and placeholder content. The back end should support a modest closed test group of about 1000 players.
$300,000 - If we achieve $300,000 in funding we will build a full Beta game and  launch with a publishing partner. The Beta Launch should be stable with a balanced economy and full content to about 100 levels. The back end should be stable and scalable, supporting a potential 200,000 DAU and a 1 million+ player install base shortly after launch.
Thanks, Everyone!
Let's make a game! Contribute Today!

Multi-tasking – i.e. attentional selection between two sets of information associated with different tasks.
Detaching attention from irrelevant items and attending to new relevant items.
Shielding against interfering information.
Episodic memory.

It takes place in the underworld where players take control over one of the four main nations struggling to survive among the dead realm: <b>Kingdom, Triumvirate, League </b>and<b> Hegemony</b>. Players establish Houses and grant them lands, obtaining more Lords  for their wars and intrigues. Through those Houses they also call armies or build mighty cities and strongholds for their nations. Their goals are simple: expanding borders and finally subjugating each other. If cornered, any of the four players can turn to dark and ancient power to gain advantage over others... The power that is controlled by the <b>5th player</b>. But such madness, comes with a price, as the goal of the fifth player isn't supremacy but annihilation of all the other players. <br/></p><h2>Death</h2>Though weak at the beggining of the game and mostly hidden from regular gameplay, if underestimated Death may succeed with awaking its Hordes and sweep across the world in devastating tide of reclamation.<p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1336372/files/20150329115019-Smierc.png?1427655019"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>The Fifth Player controlling Death, has the most challenging position of all the players.

Gameplay favors not the players who blindly memorize all the rules but rather those who can scheme and think outside the box. Like in the <b>Warfare</b>, where randomness of battles is only illusional and players can either outsmart their opponents or use brute numbers to win. <br/><br/>The possibilities on how to play <i>Nocturn</i> are only up to players imagination. <br/>Player can shut his nation inside a massive well defended valley surrounded by the mountains, waiting for an outside world to degrade into chaos. He can play as an agressor, focusing on conquering other players cities and strongholds while building few yourself. Or if he wants to play from darkness, submit early in the game to the neigbour and deceive stronger players while engaging in secret actions destabilizing the world everywhere but in his lands. Still you have to remember the World is constantly evolving around you with each passing turn. May it be that your well devised plan would crumble - your <b>Court</b> taken by other stronger player, forcing you to wonder around with few loyal troops left, selling your services to whoever would give you a glimpse of hope.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1325296/files/20150325091035-Tekst2.png?1427299835"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>Nocturn game system emphasize on managing a Nation through noble <b>Houses</b>.<br/>Through <b>Decrees</b> players collect wealth and troops from fiefdoms belonging to the Houses they control.<br/>It is also a job of Lords belonging to players Houses, to command their armies in battles and sieges.<br/><br/><br/><h2>Houses</h2>A noble House is created and comes to play when a player grants it a <b>Fiefdom</b>.

It takes place in the underworld where players take control over one of the four main nations struggling to survive among the dead realm: Kingdom, Triumvirate, League and Hegemony. Players establish Houses and grant them lands, obtaining more Lords  for their wars and intrigues. Through those Houses they also call armies or build mighty cities and strongholds for their nations. Their goals are simple: expanding borders and finally subjugating each other. If cornered, any of the four players can turn to dark and ancient power to gain advantage over others... The power that is controlled by the 5th player. But such madness, comes with a price, as the goal of the fifth player isn't supremacy but annihilation of all the other players. DeathThough weak at the beggining of the game and mostly hidden from regular gameplay, if underestimated Death may succeed with awaking its Hordes and sweep across the world in devastating tide of reclamation.The Fifth Player controlling Death, has the most challenging position of all the players. Starting with literally nothing, He or She must craftily weaken other players vigilance and gather strenght to strike at the right moment.As a God of this realm, Death holds major control over occuring events that manifest in the Epics which four players must constantly overcome.Easy to play/Difficult to masterThe basics of Nocturn are very simple to learn and a game can start even with only one person having general idea about it. Gameplay favors not the players who blindly memorize all the rules but rather those who can scheme and think outside the box. Like in the Warfare, where randomness of battles is only illusional and players can either outsmart their opponents or use brute numbers to win. The possibilities on how to play Nocturn are only up to players imagination. Player can shut his nation inside a massive well defended valley surrounded by the mountains, waiting for an outside world to degrade into chaos. He can play as an agressor, focusing on conquering other players cities and strongholds while building few yourself. Or if he wants to play from darkness, submit early in the game to the neigbour and deceive stronger players while engaging in secret actions destabilizing the world everywhere but in his lands. Still you have to remember the World is constantly evolving around you with each passing turn. May it be that your well devised plan would crumble - your Court taken by other stronger player, forcing you to wonder around with few loyal troops left, selling your services to whoever would give you a glimpse of hope.Nocturn game system emphasize on managing a Nation through noble Houses.Through Decrees players collect wealth and troops from fiefdoms belonging to the Houses they control.It is also a job of Lords belonging to players Houses, to command their armies in battles and sieges.HousesA noble House is created and comes to play when a player grants it a Fiefdom. Player use Decrees to force Houses to raise armies and pay tributes. By granting existing Houses new Fiefdoms player can earn or recruit more from future decrees passed on that House. Decrees varies from light to demanding, so keep in mind that exploited Houses may rise in a Rebellion.                       Loyalty Tokens are used to determine House revolt riskFiefdomsFiefdoms belong to Houses and are the basics of Nocturn's economy. They are created by placing their tokens on the province along with a Castle miniature. In time the Castles can be expanded.A City will rise more wealth from Decrees and will offer more defence for the fiefdom. While Stronghold grants greatest protection and is best suited for your nation borderlands. Both Cities and Strongholds are limited in numbers for each nation. In order to expand beyond that limit players need to occupy the ones build by other nations .CourtsCourts are a center of players nations. It is through controlled Court that player have an access to the nation resources. So all the pools of Brigades, Houses, Castles, Cities and Strongholds of the specific nation are only accesible to the player who controls that nation Court. Each player at the beginning of the game has control over one Court, and a point of the game for ""Living nations"" players is to change that state.Yet no player is cut off the gameplay until it ends. If a player lose his Court, he can still stay in game controolling the fractures of his former strenght. For it is always possible for him to manipulate himself back into power.EpicsThere are three kinds of Epics. One avaible only to Death, while the others avaible to the players who chose ""living nations"". Most dangerous Epics are the ones played by the player controlling Death. He uses them to influence other players actions and prepare the world for his Awakening.All the Epics have a part with conditions that, if should be met, increase Death forces summoned during awakening.The other important tool for Awakening — Soul Sacrifice tokens, give Death additional forces on the Awakening, and are given to him by players who pay for resurecting their Lords fallen during Battles or Epics.                                                                          EpicsGodsThrough ruling and expanding their nations players can win favor from the Gods... At least from three of them. Fourth God favor can only be granted by himself — the 5th player. Goddess of War favors military supremacy. Goddess of Love blesses nations with most loyal Houses. While God of Wine (...hic) prefers the nation with most Fiefdoms. During Epics favor from the Gods plays crucial role in deciding whose nobles will be victorious.The strongest blessings comes from God of Death, but by using them player can end up as pawn in Death's machinations.                                                                             God's DeckWarfareBattles are fought by Brigades activated with 
Mobilization tokens. These tokens represent the presence of Lords in armies. For every Mobilization token that represents his Lord player has the same number of false tokens he can place on board in order to obscure his plans. By activating Lords Mobilization token player can move his army or assault besieged keeps. Only armies that contain at least one Lord mobilisation token can defend efficiently. When army is attacked by another player army and doesnt contain any lords mobilisation tokens army is caught unaware and can be easily defeated.In Nocturn there are no dice. Players can 
achieve victory through use of the superior Tactic than his 
opponents or through sheer superiority in numbers.In addition armies of a different players can join forces, something that can be helpful during the Awakening to oppose the Hordes of the FIfth player.The choice of a Nocturne's battle system is based on Pentagram: There are five Tactics avaible for choosing during first step of Battle - Tactical Stage. Each Tactic defeats two Tactics and is defeated by two - thus the Tactical map forms the shape of a pentagram. But in order to win in Tactical Stage succesful side must have appropriate numbers depending on the placement of the two used Tactics on the Tactical Pentagram.In case of a draw or an insufficient numbers, Battle goes to the second part - Bloodbath Stage. Which is exactly what it sounds like.Overview of the Game TurnNocturn is played in a series of turns. Each consists of three Phases:Epics Phase, during which players draw and execute Epics.Warfare Phase, the phase of movement, battles, sieges, and in case of an
 Awakening - trying desperately to survive.Domain Phase, 
players recruit Brigades and gather tributes from subject Houses. They 
create new Fiefdoms and build new Cities and Strongholds, lastly they 
pass new decrees.What's inside:

Many different traps and enemies. Each trap/enemy has a different size, speed and behavior. 


Many things that influence the movement of the main character.

Play of lights causes that you can not often see the whole space and somewhere you can even be almost blind. Therefore be careful about the monsters they wait in the dark.
There are at least six different worlds with different graphics, the traps and the enemies.
A combination of these things creates a pretty variable level design and gameplay. There is a description of worlds with some examples of the traps and the enemies:

In more than one world: keys, doors, killer that is always behind you and wait for your mistake, speed bonuses

The above list is not all inclusive and definitive.The expected release date will be summer 2014.Stretch goalsI have a lot of ideas what to do with more money/development time:

Porting to other platforms: Super Scream Queen is portable to almost every existing platform. Mobile platforms (iOS, Android) would be probably first.

Map editor: Create and share your own levels and also play levels created by other players.

Game improvement: Higher quality and number of the levels, better graphics, a wider offer of monsters and worlds, more music etc.

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Hello folks,</p>
<p>my name is Dennis and I am 25 years old. Making games is still one of my biggest dreams since my childhood. That's why I quit my job in the beginning of 2016. I founded The Inferno Games and right now I am working on a new project called Project SolarBot.</p>
<p>Beeing independant is great. No supervisor who wants to tell you at what time of the day you are allowed to get some coffee and no annoying co-workers. But here comes the flip side of the coin: You have a ton of responsibility to deal with.</p>
<p>By supporting me and my project, you take away a lot of financial pressure from me. See, working on making your dream come true might be really fullfilling, but at a certain point (especially in the beginning) you can't fill your tummy with this good feel.</p>
<p>So by funding me with a dollar or two, I can fill my tummy and satisfy your hunger for a good action game!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why 4,000 €?</h3>
<p>I picked this funding goal because I want to expand my possibilities as a creator. 4,000 €(approx. 4,500 $) will be enough for me, to finish the work on Project SolarBot without any limitations. </p>
<p>And because I, and especially the indie game genre would be nothing without their backers, every single backer will get a credit entry!</p>
<p>What? You are not interested in a lousy name, displayed on a monitor? No problem. Have a look at the other perks! There's more awesome stuff that you can get as a supporter!</p>
<p>Note: I choose a fixed funding goal, meaning that you will get you money back if we wont reach the 4,000 €.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Any risks? Why should I believe in you?</h3> <p>Let's be real here. Making a video game, promoting and selling it is a lot of work. I know what I am talking about since I've already completed my work on a game this year.</p>
<p>But this first game was just created to learn how to make games in the first place. I got all the experience I need in order to make a game that fits my aims and your standards!</p>

Hello folks,
my name is Dennis and I am 25 years old. Making games is still one of my biggest dreams since my childhood. That's why I quit my job in the beginning of 2016. I founded The Inferno Games and right now I am working on a new project called Project SolarBot.
Beeing independant is great. No supervisor who wants to tell you at what time of the day you are allowed to get some coffee and no annoying co-workers. But here comes the flip side of the coin: You have a ton of responsibility to deal with.
By supporting me and my project, you take away a lot of financial pressure from me. See, working on making your dream come true might be really fullfilling, but at a certain point (especially in the beginning) you can't fill your tummy with this good feel.
So by funding me with a dollar or two, I can fill my tummy and satisfy your hunger for a good action game!

Why 4,000 €?
I picked this funding goal because I want to expand my possibilities as a creator. 4,000 €(approx. 4,500 $) will be enough for me, to finish the work on Project SolarBot without any limitations. 
And because I, and especially the indie game genre would be nothing without their backers, every single backer will get a credit entry!
What? You are not interested in a lousy name, displayed on a monitor? No problem. Have a look at the other perks! There's more awesome stuff that you can get as a supporter!
Note: I choose a fixed funding goal, meaning that you will get you money back if we wont reach the 4,000 €.

Any risks? Why should I believe in you? Let's be real here. Making a video game, promoting and selling it is a lot of work. I know what I am talking about since I've already completed my work on a game this year.
But this first game was just created to learn how to make games in the first place. I got all the experience I need in order to make a game that fits my aims and your standards!


In Project SolarBot you take control of a robot. Your mission is to explore a planet named Ers. But always keep an eye on your solar meter. As soon as you're down to 0 points, SolarBot will drop like a fly.
 
Good night, little boy...
Fear not! You can recharge your little toy by placing him in the sun. Well, this could be a problem in caves and facilities... Meh, you'll figure something out!

As mentioned before, you're wandering on a planet searching for materials and rare technology. During your mission you'll get better equipment and the old technology will teach SolarBot how to work more efficiently. 

Exploring is the most important thing in this game. Make sure that you've checked every stone before proceeding!
 

Improve the SolarBot by discovering secrets!
As time goes by, SolarBot will be receiving upgrades and new weapons. With those new upgrades you will be able to interact with your surroundings. An example:

This magnetic field prevents you from jumping high enough to get the Solar Tank on the rock. What could you do to reach it?
 

Correct! Use the Magnetic Beam to switch the poles of the field. Now you'll get a huge jump boost and you'll be able to reach the Solar Tank!
 
One of my favourite things in video games is exploring the world you are playing in. So I decided to implement this feature in Project SolarBot too! With your scan visor you can scan things like enemies and technological stuff. Check it out!
 

By using your scan visor on certain things, you can discover even more secrets and details of planet Ers.
 

If you scanned an object, be sure to check out the database in the main menu. It will reveal weaknesses and you can learn stuff about the creature you're about to destroy too.

Ten years ago, a group of scientists found out, that the current supply of ressources will only last for about 12 years. Now, that we almost reached this deadline, the governments of your homeworld initiated a big project. Project SolarBot! 
Only the smartest under the smart ones were allowed to work on this project. The mission: Send a robot to the nearest, once inhabited planet in our galaxy in order to extract and discover ressources and - if there is any left - technology.
After they finished their work, SolarBot was born! Equipped with a beam weapon, a scan visor and lots of solar panels, the little robot starts his journey. What kind of adventure awaits you? Will you be able to save your homeworld? Do you even want to save it? 
The scientists had to admit that the A.I. could have been better, but who says that A.I. can't grow with its tasks?

<h1>Are you tired of playing video games in which blowing up massive robots is not the main objective?</h1>
<p>That question and many more are what influenced and shaped <strong>BASEWARS</strong>, a game in which you and your friends battle hordes of robots cooperatively online. <strong>BASEWARS</strong> is a wave defense game (Think Call of Duty: Zombies) that focuses on offering many diverse rewarding experiences rather than stale repetitive gameplay.</p>
<p><strong>BASEWARS </strong>pays tribute to some of the earliest FPS games like Doom, Quake, and Unreal Tournament by replicating some of the crazy fast-paced action that made them so iconic.</p>

<h2>How do you feel about open source projects?</h2>
<p>BASEWARS is constructed on the now open-source Torque3D engine, by funding the project we hope to futher Torque3D development by helping out with bug fixes. We also firmly believe that BASEWARS will end up open source in 5-10 years so that we may help others figure out the inner workings of video games.</p>

Are you tired of playing video games in which blowing up massive robots is not the main objective?
That question and many more are what influenced and shaped BASEWARS, a game in which you and your friends battle hordes of robots cooperatively online. BASEWARS is a wave defense game (Think Call of Duty: Zombies) that focuses on offering many diverse rewarding experiences rather than stale repetitive gameplay.
BASEWARS pays tribute to some of the earliest FPS games like Doom, Quake, and Unreal Tournament by replicating some of the crazy fast-paced action that made them so iconic.

This is actually one of the smaller robots.

<p>BECKONED is a 20-hour epic narrative, driven by an fresh ""active"" turn-based combat system showcasing a varied list of attack combos, spells, and support mechanics.</p>
<p>The story follows a boy (Taujh) searching for a crystal pendant which could contain his lost memories. Accompanied by two others (Enelh and Leign), they scurry across the landscape of Devanis* as they're swept up in a whirlwind of trouble. While mastering their surroundings and healing a land riddled with fear, they must reclaim the pendant before its lost for good. Maybe then, Taujh will finally understand who he is.</p>

<p>Trudge across wild landscapes while gathering plants and hunting animals to survive. Master the environment and challenge morale-crushing bosses with help from magic derived from Loden* crystals found along the way.</p>
<p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1602101608/tbtcaor5jn2s8z6p9pnv.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Animals large and small will be hostile until they are sure they can trust you, otherwise they will attack with everything they have. Battling is based on an ""active"" turn-base combat system that allows multiple attacks and blocks on multiple targets during a turn.</p>
<div>Use combo abilities to smash feral creatures quickly. Block their attacks with precision to perform counter-combos called <i>TURNBREAKS</i>. This causes the remainder of the attackers turn to become an offensive combo opportunity for the defender.</div>

<p> Taujh acting as the “Tank,” Leign serving as the “Battle Mage”, and Enelh contributing her skills as “Healer”, their diverse skills keep the battle flowing and dynamic. Unleash powerful Shadreic Majiq* abilities by collecting and raising Lodens and learn how these skills can be layered by a cause-effect relationship.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1602101786/j4feivut1mofuslututm.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The image above depicts BECKONEDs skill/spell progression throughout the adventure. Master these Lodens and their effects to craft Amulets which act as spell load-outs. Switching Amulets and Lodens mid-combat allows for seamless role swaps when things get tough.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><u>Trust of the Wilderness</u></strong></p>
<p>All life on Devanis eats to live. The primal competition for these resources can make them protective. Harvest crafting ingredients and learn which food each creature loves the most. Use their favorite food to bait them into combat, or to pacify them during encounters, sparing them or yourself. Becoming a Master Hunter and tending to the land will help you throughout your journey.</p>

<p>Devanis is beautiful and deadly, from the cerulean shores of Burketh to the lush jungle tops of Tula’Banya, where feasting Denithite* infests the massive trees roots. Life blossoms from an energy known as Shadrea*, a consciousness permeating through a resonant network of powerful Lodens.</p>
<p>These stones are the catalyst for Devanis' advancements and ideologies, but a violent discord was driven between Loden Tuners* due to the harmful nature of Denithites growing influence within their ranks. This mysterious substance manipulates the mind and darkened the rule of Thal, detaching its kingdom from the rest of Devanis and leaving its people under complete subjugation to Denithite development.</p>
<p>A mass exodus of Jiri* escaped Thal and found refuge in a giant tree, naming it Tula'Banya. Somehow resistant, its roots seemed to halt the Denithite growth. This mystery fills the Jiri with hope to rebuild and defend all life on Devanis from the scourge of Thal.</p>

<p>Certain major personalities are well-known in towns for their services in the struggle against Thal. Their allegiances vary but it's often easy to find common-ground. Those who rise as pillars of fear and deceit are spoken of very little, especially to young ears. Showing caution, and maybe a hint of reckless bravery, the local outlook on the future might improve as you listen to their stories in the shadow of Denithite's power.</p>

<p>We have planned for a PC(Windows) release since day one, as we are developing BECKONED on PC. To port BECKONED over to MAC and Linux should not be a huge hurdle as Unreal4 allows for these conversions, but we anticipate a few issues along the way. We will iron those issues out before releasing MAC and Linux versions and retain product quality.</p>
<p>Many of you asked for console releases, and mainly for the Nintendo Switch. We are unable to determine at this time, when we can port to consoles. It depends on the success of the PC launch. As Unreal4 does have the tools to do so, we would need to hire the best people to address these ports for product quality, legal agreements and programming/code/control-scheme changes within these conversions.</p>
<p>We will expand to all platforms when we are able, but it would not be all at once. If any options become available during development or sooner, we will update our info and let everyone know as soon as we can promise it.</p>

<p>Zade Studios LLC began in 2016 as an Indie venture which grew towards the creation of a major flag-ship videogame title, we call Beckoned. In 2019, we began converting our concepts from years of pre-production and design work towards a playable prototype. As we continue to grow and network in this amazing industry we are very humbled to be at this point.</p>
<p>For years BECKONED boiled in the imagination long before its name. A bereft scatter of a child's scribbles of nonsense and vein. Though the hole of his curiosity grew deep, the yearning to touch another world filled the pages of his sketchbooks. Creatures upon another, this space revealed itself slowly. Each drawing becoming another lens to peer through and witness places beyond knowing. </p>
<p>BECKONED is a epic story of voluntary heroism in a world of chaos, to encourage the selfless and spare the helpless. The story of BECKONED culminates the introduction to a dangerous new world. The tale is much longer and as we grow, so too will the adventures through this strange and curious land called Devanis.</p>

<p>“If I was a 15-year-old me playing BECKONED...</p>
<p>I play it because it makes me feel as if I am really affecting another world, one that all but begs me to be that part of it.</p>
<p>I feel like the characters are relatable to me at a core level.</p>
<p>I find bravery when I play it.</p>
<p>I have confidence in the progression because each character allows me to uncover the possible solutions for encountered problems.</p>
<p>The strangeness is familiar as well. That foreign feeling allows me to have my own fresh perspective on all the content.</p>
<p>The action feels so responsive and intuitive, making it easy for me to manage and control every move. The melee and magic both feel great, interacting with each other to become an unbeatable combination.</p>
<p>The world truly Beckoned me forth from reality to experience its wonders and find the purpose to save it. And I am almost there...” – Jeremy Thevenot</p>
<p>There is only room for creativity and compassion here, as well a humble heart to know when to learn from ones mistakes. We want to make a great game.

BECKONED is a 20-hour epic narrative, driven by an fresh ""active"" turn-based combat system showcasing a varied list of attack combos, spells, and support mechanics.
The story follows a boy (Taujh) searching for a crystal pendant which could contain his lost memories. Accompanied by two others (Enelh and Leign), they scurry across the landscape of Devanis* as they're swept up in a whirlwind of trouble. While mastering their surroundings and healing a land riddled with fear, they must reclaim the pendant before its lost for good. Maybe then, Taujh will finally understand who he is.

Trudge across wild landscapes while gathering plants and hunting animals to survive. Master the environment and challenge morale-crushing bosses with help from magic derived from Loden* crystals found along the way.

Animals large and small will be hostile until they are sure they can trust you, otherwise they will attack with everything they have. Battling is based on an ""active"" turn-base combat system that allows multiple attacks and blocks on multiple targets during a turn.
Use combo abilities to smash feral creatures quickly. Block their attacks with precision to perform counter-combos called TURNBREAKS. This causes the remainder of the attackers turn to become an offensive combo opportunity for the defender.
 
 Taujh acting as the “Tank,” Leign serving as the “Battle Mage”, and Enelh contributing her skills as “Healer”, their diverse skills keep the battle flowing and dynamic. Unleash powerful Shadreic Majiq* abilities by collecting and raising Lodens and learn how these skills can be layered by a cause-effect relationship.

The image above depicts BECKONEDs skill/spell progression throughout the adventure. Master these Lodens and their effects to craft Amulets which act as spell load-outs. Switching Amulets and Lodens mid-combat allows for seamless role swaps when things get tough.
Trust of the Wilderness
All life on Devanis eats to live. The primal competition for these resources can make them protective. Harvest crafting ingredients and learn which food each creature loves the most. Use their favorite food to bait them into combat, or to pacify them during encounters, sparing them or yourself. Becoming a Master Hunter and tending to the land will help you throughout your journey.



Devanis is beautiful and deadly, from the cerulean shores of Burketh to the lush jungle tops of Tula’Banya, where feasting Denithite* infests the massive trees roots. Life blossoms from an energy known as Shadrea*, a consciousness permeating through a resonant network of powerful Lodens.
These stones are the catalyst for Devanis' advancements and ideologies, but a violent discord was driven between Loden Tuners* due to the harmful nature of Denithites growing influence within their ranks. This mysterious substance manipulates the mind and darkened the rule of Thal, detaching its kingdom from the rest of Devanis and leaving its people under complete subjugation to Denithite development.
A mass exodus of Jiri* escaped Thal and found refuge in a giant tree, naming it Tula'Banya. Somehow resistant, its roots seemed to halt the Denithite growth. This mystery fills the Jiri with hope to rebuild and defend all life on Devanis from the scourge of Thal.

Although Devanis is home to many cultures and climates, the story of BECKONED will explore five ""towns"" and five ""dungeons"" within the Eastern region of the continent  Aurleia. Discover the richness of Devanis as you encounter many colorful NPCs and learn of their ambitions, lessons, fears, and local gossip. Harvest plants for resources to craft items and amulets, or let your gardens shape the landscape to give your own personal touch to the world.

Certain major personalities are well-known in towns for their services in the struggle against Thal. Their allegiances vary but it's often easy to find common-ground. Those who rise as pillars of fear and deceit are spoken of very little, especially to young ears. Showing caution, and maybe a hint of reckless bravery, the local outlook on the future might improve as you listen to their stories in the shadow of Denithite's power.



A young and energetic child, Taujh finds himself lost without his memories and a now-stolen necklace that may hold the key to his identity. His wild courage is always present, but he's often hard on himself as he takes on the visceral and telling trials ahead.

Calm in her demeanor, Enelh holds a strong resolve for the well-being of those around her. Having spent most of her time harvesting plants for her mother, she is familiar with Shadreic Majiq and its presence in all life on Devanis. As the daughter of a village elder, she is well-loved in her home of Burketh. The help she gives her people mirrors her mother's mature nature.

Bursting with attitude, Leign keeps his personal life secret. He is proud of working with a renowned merchant of RedMouth (a major commercial center in Aurleia) and feels qualified for any job. He possesses impressive skill in the wild and masters its resources with ease. He serves Enelh as a friendly bodyguard when she ventures out gathering plants.

As traveling companions, Daash and Yokaa are effective members of Granulus Drier, a back-alley gang of RedMouth. With a mind for trade and the other for harmony, they are driven towards treasure and discovery.

Although clumsy, Grynthe is a savant sproutling phytominer* and daughter of a prolific Tula'Banyan shipwright. She spends her days studying while her nights are filled with building gadgets displaying her knowledge of Soil-Core technology.


 Burketh
 A sunset can never be more soothing than from the shores of this coastal village northwest of the South Sovereign Lands. It is home to Jiri and human, both using their strengths in unison establishing the village’s true specialty of fishing. Burketh is also famous for its cooking and alchemical ingredients throughout the continent of Aurleia. The people living here hunt, gather, and prepare wonderful dishes for anyone who takes the time to enjoy the local culture.

RedMouth
Lurking in an ancient nest, this notorious destination is not for the meek. Red Mouth is a collector's delight as its streets are filled with goods and characters from all corners of Devanis. Keeping the wealth flowing, a renowned merchant known as Dramm uses his 'Code' to keep order among the traders and thieves.

Tula'Banya
The haven-home for the Jiri and a bastion for the advancements in Loden technologies, the kingdom is nestled within a giant tree. From festivals and architecture, to the ships which sail and soar, all manners of wonder hang from its branches. The people are lively in their common goal of defeating Thal and liberating Devanis from the influence of Denithite.









 




The Music featured in the BECKONED Prototype and trailer was composed by Johnny Flannigan, and we are very proud to have his talents for the prototype.
We all agree that music is one of the key ingredients for a great JRPG, so we are actively seeking a professional Music Composer to give BECKONED the professionalism needed for a memorable and functional score.
We are aiming for a primitive soundscape of natural winds, strings, and percussion, with an experimental and otherworldly approach to music theory and mastering for games.


We have planned for a PC(Windows) release since day one, as we are developing BECKONED on PC. To port BECKONED over to MAC and Linux should not be a huge hurdle as Unreal4 allows for these conversions, but we anticipate a few issues along the way. We will iron those issues out before releasing MAC and Linux versions and retain product quality.
Many of you asked for console releases, and mainly for the Nintendo Switch. We are unable to determine at this time, when we can port to consoles. It depends on the success of the PC launch. As Unreal4 does have the tools to do so, we would need to hire the best people to address these ports for product quality, legal agreements and programming/code/control-scheme changes within these conversions.
We will expand to all platforms when we are able, but it would not be all at once. If any options become available during development or sooner, we will update our info and let everyone know as soon as we can promise it.


Zade Studios LLC began in 2016 as an Indie venture which grew towards the creation of a major flag-ship videogame title, we call Beckoned. In 2019, we began converting our concepts from years of pre-production and design work towards a playable prototype. As we continue to grow and network in this amazing industry we are very humbled to be at this point.
For years BECKONED boiled in the imagination long before its name. A bereft scatter of a child's scribbles of nonsense and vein. Though the hole of his curiosity grew deep, the yearning to touch another world filled the pages of his sketchbooks. Creatures upon another, this space revealed itself slowly. Each drawing becoming another lens to peer through and witness places beyond knowing. 
BECKONED is a epic story of voluntary heroism in a world of chaos, to encourage the selfless and spare the helpless. The story of BECKONED culminates the introduction to a dangerous new world. The tale is much longer and as we grow, so too will the adventures through this strange and curious land called Devanis.
         


Jeremy Thevenot serves as CEO, Project Lead, Game Director, Art Director, Animator, Narrative/Scenario Design and more...

Dwight Thevenot serves as CFO, Program Director/Designer, Structure Designer, Programming Engineer,  Anything-Wizard and more...

Adding the next volley of features will take some time as we are a small team of developers for now. We would like to hire subcontractors or specialized personnel to help in specific fields. This way, we can optimize the development pipeline as well as any programming or visual/audio improvements needed along the way.


Our goal is to raise $68,000 (Fixed) to help fund the Development of BECKONED BRONZE version.
Meeting our funding-goal brings the rewards to everyone on time and helps BECKONED come to life with completed story campaign, battle-system, base magic-system, five core dungeons with enemies/bosses, a HUD/UX based town system, as well an essential shop-system.
We want to be clear and humble when we say a development timeline of 2.5 - 3 years is tight without major delays, and above all else we want to release a good game, worthy of everyone's help and support.
""A delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad."" -Shigeru Miyamoto
The current prototype demo of BECKONED is playable on STEAM! We wanted you to have a chance to play a small piece before helping us and welcome you into a community that is curious and excited to discuss and critique what we have done so far. 

CLICK THE IMAGE ABOVE TO VISIT THE BECKONED STEAM PAGE
This prototype demo executes on our game design, art design, and implementation of the assets within a presentable story-telling package. Although there are definite improvements needed, we received excellent reactions, comments and positivity from the communities on Reddit, Instagram, and STEAM! We are so thankful for everyone who takes the time to try it out and give us feed back! Its been an effective way to know what to adjust, improve and iterate on!


Each stretch goal represents additional mechanical and artistic additions including explorable towns, more combos and spells, and a richer experience across all aspects of the product. More game, means more development time. As we reach our stretch-goals, we will release the developmental, mechanical and artistic breakdowns to keep you informed and excited about the larger visions and plans.



As mentioned above, if we can reach the Gold tier stretch goal, we will implement the lighting System while creating more robust crafting and gardening systems. This would allow for added recipes, ingredients, garden bonuses, and day/night cycles.


Our design takes full advantage of Unreal4 Lighting capabilities, giving BECKONED atmosphere and depth. Although not implemented in the Prototype, we have done the experiments proving we can do it. We would like to be able to put more work into making a full version with proper lighting and special effects, especially for the combat system.


 

Placing the materials for this lighting technique greatly increases the work load, but with more time and skilled minds it should be no problem. We have the plans; we just need your help to execute it properly and in a reasonable amount of time.



“If I was a 15-year-old me playing BECKONED...
I play it because it makes me feel as if I am really affecting another world, one that all but begs me to be that part of it.
I feel like the characters are relatable to me at a core level.
I find bravery when I play it.
I have confidence in the progression because each character allows me to uncover the possible solutions for encountered problems.
The strangeness is familiar as well. That foreign feeling allows me to have my own fresh perspective on all the content.
The action feels so responsive and intuitive, making it easy for me to manage and control every move. The melee and magic both feel great, interacting with each other to become an unbeatable combination.
The world truly Beckoned me forth from reality to experience its wonders and find the purpose to save it. And I am almost there...” – Jeremy Thevenot
There is only room for creativity and compassion here, as well a humble heart to know when to learn from ones mistakes. We want to make a great game. We want to give it a story to bring fun, escape, and hope. An adventure to help us all find the hero within ourselves during the chaos of reality and feel the rush of cutting our own path and never letting up. We want to put Beckoned out there to inspire others to bring a world to life themselves and broaden the stories we all can tell using video-games as the medium.


Devanis /'di-von-iss/ – A planet diverse in life and intrigue, featuring natural deposits called Lodens formed within the planet. Aurleia, Feneris, and Bistraad are its three major continents.
Loden /'load-in/ – Crystals found throughout the planet, allowing sentient beings to perform Shadreic Majiq.
Denithite /'dinn-a-thite/ – A ominous parasitic mass which litters Devanis and slowly consumes any unfortunate host, disrupting their Shadreic connection and resonances.
Shadreic Majiq /'shah-drey-ik magic/ – Abilities drawn from Lodens, pending on one’s ability to tune themselves to a force known as the Shadrea.
Shadrea /'sha-drey-ah/ – A conscious fractal lattice (matrix) infused together with Devanis’ physical lattice (ref. E8 lie group) through harmonic resonance.
Tuners /'tew-ners/ – Essentially wizards/scientists using meditation and frequencies to manifest tangible causes and effects by tuning Lodens, but more advance tuners use this ability to explore the Shell.
The Shell – The fractal space of the Shadrea accessible through advanced focused meditation and explorative tuning. 
Jiri /'jee-ree/ – A highly socialized and developed species resembling primates which possess a specialized potency with Shadreic Majiq, as they lead Devanis in Loden technology and theology.
Phytominer /'fight-o-miner/– One who uses plant life to selectively concentrate specific metals and Lodens from the soil within their tissues, allowing for the extraction of those minerals for industrialized and common uses.",56.0,1,"1 Campaign

For me Videogames are the best way to present narrative experiences in a compeling in an extraordinary ways, that´s why I want they are so important to experiment with.
With new games trying to expand frontiers of what games can offer, we want to try new ways to share cool ideas to expand this frontiers in the terror sector.
Al Calva, Cybernetics Engineer and Math teacher at IPN. one of the largest universities in Mexico, my second job is programming videogames and designing characters for sale as assets, videogames have always been an integral part of my life aling movies as my main form of escapism of hard working field here in Mexico.
I am convinced that single player videogames still have a place in the current ecosystem of videogames.

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>After seeing the large desire for a Dota 2 Bot API on <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/search?q=bot&amp;restrict_sr=on"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">reddit</a>, I decided to try and create a Bot API such that everyone would be able to create a Dota 2 Bot just like people can with Brood War and the <a href=""https://github.com/bwapi/bwapi"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">BWAPI</a>. Since the LUA code running in Dota 2 doesn't allow for file I/O and multi-threading, it is unsuited for making complex bots.</p>
<p>As documented on my  <a href=""http://www.liquiddota.com/blogs/LetaBot"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">liquiddota blog</a>  , I have tried several other methods until I found out about the <a href=""https://github.com/lightbringer/dota2ai"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dota 2 AI framework</a> by Tobias Mahlmann.</p>
<p>But as mentioned on the github page, this framework is not finished yet. It is also only available for the Java programming language. As noted on the <a href=""https://github.com/lightbringer/dota2ai/wiki/The-Example-Bot"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">instructions</a> : ""you need to be familiar with Java programming and building an application using maven"".</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The proposal</h3>
<p>So instead of using Java with maven, I decided to use an Apache/php server to act as a middleman. This server will communicate between the LUA code and the code that does the decision making.<br/>This way you will only have to run the installer of XAMPP which handles the apache/php , copy some .php files and double click on the bot run script to play versus custom made bots. Thus eliminating the need to know any programming at all.<br/>You can try out the proof of concept <a href=""http://www.liquiddota.com/blogs/512441-dota-2-bot-api-6-apache-php-framework-poc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. The installation instructions will be mostly the smae for the final version.</p>
<p>Besides the Bot API itself, I will also be creating a fully customizable bot with the API. This Practice bot will allow you to customize the hero compositions of the bots, the farm priority and which lane (or jungle) the bots are (for both friendly and enemy bots). You can find a list of all the planned features for both the API framework and the Practice bots <a href=""http://www.liquiddota.com/blogs/515737-bot-api-8-planned-features"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here.</a></p>
</div><div>
<h3>How will the funding be spend</h3>
<p>The funding will be used for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding missing features from the Dota 2 AI framework made by Tobias Mahlmann.</li>
<li>Making some other small adjustments due to the fact that the apache server will not be directly used to control the bot. This is mainly to allow other programming languages to be used for writing a Dota 2 bot as well.</li>
<li>Writing the php code for the apache server.</li>
<li>Creating a Practice bot with the API so that people can test certain strategies versus bots, which would otherwise require 9 other players to do what you tell them to. The planned features of this bot can be found <a href=""http://www.liquiddota.com/blogs/515737-bot-api-8-planned-features"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here. This bot will be written in C++, but the API can support any programming language.</a>
</li>
</ul>All these parts will be available open source.</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>The main risk to this project is Valve deciding that HTTP requests are no longer allowed in the LUA code. The AI framework relies on this, since this is the only way the LUA code can communicate with an outside process.<br/>If this happens then the only way to make custom bots would be a reverse engineering project like the BWAPI (which would mean you would only be able to play it offline because of VAC), or using image processing to determine the game state (very comutationally expensive)<br/><br/>However since quite some mods rely on HTTP request to store persistent data, I don't see Valve removing this function anytime soon.<br/> <h3>The Developer</h3>

<h3>News</h3>
<p>Future news and updates will be posted here as well as at  <a href=""http://millenniumgravitas.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://millenniumgravitas.wordpress.com/</a> until a proper website is launched.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Millennium Gravitas is a tactical science-fiction cardgame of eXploration, eXpansion, eXploitation, and eXtermination (4X).</p>
<p>Did you ever wish you could take games like Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri or Master Of Orion on vacation and play them with your friends on a beach in the caribbeans?</p>
<p>Yeah, me neither, but I made it happen anyways!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Model</h3>
<p>I've chosen <strong>fixed funding</strong> for a few reasons.</p>
<p>First, the Indiegogo campaign doesn't only serve to raise funds, but also to see if there is a place on the market for my game.</p>
<p>The amount I'm asking for is modest, and if there aren't enough people to cover this cost, maybe its best to wait with publishing until a better opportunity arises.</p>
<p>Second, I believe its the best way to engage and build a comunity around the game, as well as provide backers with a guarantee that their money will not be lost if the funding is unsuccessful.</p>
<p>I am also of the mindset that nobody should buy games blindly, thats why I will provide <strong>a demo-version of Millennium Gravitas on launch</strong> for everyone to try out in both print and digital form.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>About the Game</strong></h3>
<p>As mentioned, Millennium Gravitas is a tactical 4X card-game featuring all the elements you would expect like:<strong><br/></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Invasion and Colonization of Planets</strong></li>
<li><strong>Technology Research</strong></li>
<li><strong>Tactical Space-combat</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ship Construction and Customization</strong></li>
<li><strong>Anomalies</strong></li>
<li><strong>Resource Management</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When designing the game I tried to keep a familiarity of mechanis while adding new ones like time-management, resource-diversity, initiative,  different victory-conditions and customization.</p>
<p>Millennium Gravitas relies far less on luck-of-the-draw than other comparable games and gives the player more control over their strategy.</p>
<p>The core mechanics are focused on <strong>flexibility and tactics rather than deck-building</strong> or owning the most powerful cards to overpower your opponent.</p>
<p>I reinforced this with<strong> three different victory-conditions</strong> that are not contingent upon each other:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Extinction</strong> - The opposing player loses all Population (by invasion or destruction of planets or structures)</li>
<li>
<strong>Starvation </strong>- The opposing player loses all Energy (by stealing energy or destroying collectors)</li>
<li>
<strong>Burnout</strong> - The opposing player loses the ability to play Units (by losing all cards in his main deck and hand)</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropbox.com/u/12895612/carddemo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>This gives players the ability to find weakpoints in each others current strategy and find new creative avenues to success that does not necessarily rely on brute force or a superior deck.</p>
<p>A player can conceivably win a match even when being completely outgunned by starving the enemy player to death or stealthily invading all his planets instead of attacking him head-on.</p>
<p>The game also supports <strong>different game-modes</strong>, like 1vs1, 2vs2 or +4vs (the mechanics theoretically do not limit the amount of players that are able to play together or against each other)</p>
<p>All complex playstyles are supported, <strong>from team-matches to last-man-standing</strong>. This creates many interesting games with temporary alliances and even politics as emergent gameplay.</p>
<p>Additionally <strong>Millennium does not require a game-board</strong> or sophisticated game-pieces and miniatures, all you need to play is knowledge of the rules, your own deck, and something to be used as tokens.</p>
<p>Millenium Gravitas is a self-contained package, ready to go whenever you are, while still being a fully complex 4X experience.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropbox.com/u/12895612/game_space.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>At launch the game will feature two faction decks with 70 cards total per set.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>The Commonwealth</strong> - Reliant on heavy, tough ships with great defensive potential.</li>
<li>
<strong>The Sknaszi Hive</strong> - Reliant on swarm-tactics as well as interaction between units.</li>
</ul>
<p>Boosters will provide additional cards for both factions, <strong>there is no faction-lock</strong>, so faction-units can be played together if desired. The same is true of technology as well as planets.</p>
<p>At this point in time it is hard to estimate how much individual box-sets and boosters will cost at launch, due to unknow manufacturing cost which depends on ordered units (your expressed interest).</p>
<p>I am however confident to be able to offer a price that is competitive to other similar games on the market.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What Has Already Been Done</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>I have worked on this project on and off for a year in my spare time and all cards, tokens and art-assets are completely finished, print-ready, including the box-design and manual.</p>
<p><img alt=""Box Set Mockup"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropbox.com/u/12895612/box%20sets2.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: text-bottom;"" title=""Box Set Mockup""/></p>
<p>The game however lacks the last bits of polish to make it the high-quality product I want it to be.</p>
<p>Primarily these are: Beta-testing and balance, translation and proofreading as well as a community infrastructure (website, forum, tools).</p>
<p>With your help I can make it happen!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Successful Funding And Beyond</h3>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropbox.com/u/12895612/roadmap.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Where Does Your Money Go?</h3>
<p><strong>Website and Hosting</strong></p>
<p>While I am a Graphics Designer by trade, I am horrible at Webdesign and should not touch HTML or CSS even if my life depended on it.</p>
<p>Planned is a website with relevant information about the game, tutorials, downloadable goodies and a forum for the community to provide feedback as well as testing-experience.</p>
<p>I need to hire a web-designer/developer to do this for me.</p>
<p>A placeholder website untill I find a web-designer is located at: <a href=""http://millenniumgravitas.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://millenniumgravitas.wordpress.com/</a></p>
<p>News and information will be posted here and on the website.</p>
<p><strong>Proofreading and Translation</strong></p>
<p>I speak and write english acceptably well, however it's not my primary language. This means that the manual and cards will contain typos, grammatical errors and could be generally hard to read if I leave them as they are.</p>
<p>I will need to hire someone that will help me iron out my language which is very important, especially when writing rules for a game. There can be no ambigiuity in the finer points of the mechanics created by bad english.</p>
<p>I also intend to slowly translate the game into three other languages that I speak, german, swedish and polish, this will also require help.</p>
<p>In the future I might even translate the game into more languages if it becomes successful.</p>
<p><strong>Playtesting and Digital Edition</strong></p>
<p>This is what I need most. I need a reasonably large amount of people that will playtest the game and help me balance the cards and decks.</p>
<p>There is only one cheap way to do this, by making a digital version available for beta-testers online.</p>
<p>I have spoken with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LackeyCCG"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Trevor Agnitti</a>, the creator of the freeware card-game tool <a href=""http://www.lackeyccg.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LackeyCCG</a> that allows internet and network play. He agreed to create a plugin for Millenium Gravitas that will allow the game to be played with his tool.</p>
<p>Since the progress of beta-testing will require iteration of the game-files and I am not a coder, I am aiming for a long-term relationship with Trevor that will allow me to keep the tool up to date.</p>
<p><strong>LackeyCCG is a cross-platform tool for Mac, Linux and Windows</strong>, so nobody should be singled out from the fun.</p>
<p>The tool with the plugin will be available early on the website for beta-testers if you donate in the respective tier, and <strong>will also be available as the game's DEMO on the website post-launch.</strong> Everybody wins.</p>
<p><strong>Tutorial Videos</strong></p>
<p>I have plans to develop a series of narrated tutorial-videos that will be available on the website. The videos will mainly contain a quickstart-guide on how to play the game.</p>
<p>While i can, and will, create the animations myself I will need to hire a voice-actor for the narration because nobody wants to listen to my eastern-european accent.</p>
<p><strong>Manufacture and Prototypes</strong></p>
<p>While I already have a manufacturer chosen, I want to use the funds to print large amounts of prototypes and near-release candidates to send to game-reviewers, as well as to deploy playtest-versions in RPG-stores in the area.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why A Physical Product? Why A Card-Game?</h3>
<p>Because it was something realistically achievable for me.</p>
<p>I picked a medium I can work in and realistically create a high quality product that people would want to play.</p>
<p>With Millennium Gravitas I am confident to produce something worthwhile that will add to the genre as well as provide a lot of fun.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>*Project Next-Gen </h3>
<p>Project Next-Gen would be the next step in the evolution of Millenium Gravitas and could only be achieved if the game is tremendously successful.</p>
<p>The idea is to create a version of the game for the Android platform (Smartphones/Tablets) that integrates into the physical version of Millenium Gravitas.</p>
<p>When buying physical box-sets, boosters or individual cards they would be playable in the android-version of the game, online, or in local multiplayer.</p>
<p>Imagine having your deck always handy to play on your phone, with legitimate cards you purchased either physically or digitally, connected to the whole world.</p>
<p>The Android platform and mobile gaming seems like a logical step into the future for TCGs and CCGs.</p>
<p>The game itself would be free to download, cards or starter-packs would be sold separately, and of course you could add your previously purchased cards to the game immediately</p>
<p>Of course the 10,000$ goal from this campaign alone would not be enough to create this version of the game, especially since only about 4,000 would be left for this project.</p>
<p>However it would show tremendous interest in a concept like this and I would immediately start pre-production towards it with a release in the not too distant future.</p>
<p><strong>What are the benefits of donating towards the 10,000$ goal?</strong></p>
<p>I need to know that this interest exists to develop a system that will assign every physically produced card a unique, non-crackable code for the preparation of this digital version (else older cards produced before the android version would not be playable or addable).</p>
<p>I would also need to change my manufacturer and revamp the whole game in a way that prepares it for a future digital online launch as described.<strong><br/></strong></p>
<p>I already have some concepts, but they need consultation with game-developers and programmers.</p>
<p>If the project doesn't reach 10,000$ it will show me that there isn't enough interest towards that kind of system.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT: The 10,000$ goal is not a guarantee for the creation for such a game, nor does it represent the complete amount of funding required for its creation.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It is a declaration of interest by the community of TCG and CCG players for such a game to exist, and provides me with funds to start pre-production.</strong></p>
<p> </p>

<h3>How else can I help?</h3>
<p>Share and care.</p>
<p>If you can't donate but find this game intriguing, spread the word.</p>
<p>Twitter, Facebook, Forums, get the word out there!</p>
<p>A temporary website has been made for the duration of the indiegogo campaign: <a href=""http://millenniumgravitas.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://millenniumgravitas.wordpress.com/</a></p>
<p>You can also follow the game on Twitter at <a href=""https://twitter.com/millenniumtgc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://twitter.com/millenniumtgc</a></p>
<p>Thank you all in advance.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I'm a Graphics Designer by trade.</p>
<p>Other than that, I am an amateur game-designer and enthusiast.</p>
<p>I have spent many years playing TCG and CCGs as well as board and role-playing games, creating my own rule-sets and settings for various popular RPG-systems like DnD 4e, Savage Worlds or Pathfinder.</p>
<p>While I do not have any experience in making games commercially, I find great pleasure in analyzing and reverse-engineering games and their mechanics.</p>
<p>Of course I put them back together when I'm done, in a different order.</p>
<p>It's a natural step for me to try and produce something that can be published to the public and not just played by a handful of my friends.</p>

Introduction
Millennium Gravitas is a tactical science-fiction cardgame of eXploration, eXpansion, eXploitation, and eXtermination (4X).
Did you ever wish you could take games like Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri or Master Of Orion on vacation and play them with your friends on a beach in the caribbeans?
Yeah, me neither, but I made it happen anyways!
 
Model
I've chosen fixed funding for a few reasons.
First, the Indiegogo campaign doesn't only serve to raise funds, but also to see if there is a place on the market for my game.
The amount I'm asking for is modest, and if there aren't enough people to cover this cost, maybe its best to wait with publishing until a better opportunity arises.
Second, I believe its the best way to engage and build a comunity around the game, as well as provide backers with a guarantee that their money will not be lost if the funding is unsuccessful.
I am also of the mindset that nobody should buy games blindly, thats why I will provide a demo-version of Millennium Gravitas on launch for everyone to try out in both print and digital form.
 
About the Game
As mentioned, Millennium Gravitas is a tactical 4X card-game featuring all the elements you would expect like:

Invasion and Colonization of Planets
Technology Research
Tactical Space-combat
Ship Construction and Customization
Anomalies
Resource Management

When designing the game I tried to keep a familiarity of mechanis while adding new ones like time-management, resource-diversity, initiative,  different victory-conditions and customization.
Millennium Gravitas relies far less on luck-of-the-draw than other comparable games and gives the player more control over their strategy.
The core mechanics are focused on flexibility and tactics rather than deck-building or owning the most powerful cards to overpower your opponent.
I reinforced this with three different victory-conditions that are not contingent upon each other:


Extinction - The opposing player loses all Population (by invasion or destruction of planets or structures)

Starvation - The opposing player loses all Energy (by stealing energy or destroying collectors)

Burnout - The opposing player loses the ability to play Units (by losing all cards in his main deck and hand)


This gives players the ability to find weakpoints in each others current strategy and find new creative avenues to success that does not necessarily rely on brute force or a superior deck.
A player can conceivably win a match even when being completely outgunned by starving the enemy player to death or stealthily invading all his planets instead of attacking him head-on.
The game also supports different game-modes, like 1vs1, 2vs2 or +4vs (the mechanics theoretically do not limit the amount of players that are able to play together or against each other)
All complex playstyles are supported, from team-matches to last-man-standing. This creates many interesting games with temporary alliances and even politics as emergent gameplay.
Additionally Millennium does not require a game-board or sophisticated game-pieces and miniatures, all you need to play is knowledge of the rules, your own deck, and something to be used as tokens.
Millenium Gravitas is a self-contained package, ready to go whenever you are, while still being a fully complex 4X experience.

At launch the game will feature two faction decks with 70 cards total per set.


The Commonwealth - Reliant on heavy, tough ships with great defensive potential.

The Sknaszi Hive - Reliant on swarm-tactics as well as interaction between units.

Boosters will provide additional cards for both factions, there is no faction-lock, so faction-units can be played together if desired. The same is true of technology as well as planets.
At this point in time it is hard to estimate how much individual box-sets and boosters will cost at launch, due to unknow manufacturing cost which depends on ordered units (your expressed interest).
I am however confident to be able to offer a price that is competitive to other similar games on the market.
 
What Has Already Been Done


I have worked on this project on and off for a year in my spare time and all cards, tokens and art-assets are completely finished, print-ready, including the box-design and manual.

The game however lacks the last bits of polish to make it the high-quality product I want it to be.
Primarily these are: Beta-testing and balance, translation and proofreading as well as a community infrastructure (website, forum, tools).
With your help I can make it happen!

I speak and write english acceptably well, however it's not my primary language. This means that the manual and cards will contain typos, grammatical errors and could be generally hard to read if I leave them as they are.
I will need to hire someone that will help me iron out my language which is very important, especially when writing rules for a game. There can be no ambigiuity in the finer points of the mechanics created by bad english.
I also intend to slowly translate the game into three other languages that I speak, german, swedish and polish, this will also require help.
In the future I might even translate the game into more languages if it becomes successful.
Playtesting and Digital Edition
This is what I need most. I need a reasonably large amount of people that will playtest the game and help me balance the cards and decks.
There is only one cheap way to do this, by making a digital version available for beta-testers online.
I have spoken with Trevor Agnitti, the creator of the freeware card-game tool LackeyCCG that allows internet and network play. He agreed to create a plugin for Millenium Gravitas that will allow the game to be played with his tool.
Since the progress of beta-testing will require iteration of the game-files and I am not a coder, I am aiming for a long-term relationship with Trevor that will allow me to keep the tool up to date.
LackeyCCG is a cross-platform tool for Mac, Linux and Windows, so nobody should be singled out from the fun.
The tool with the plugin will be available early on the website for beta-testers if you donate in the respective tier, and will also be available as the game's DEMO on the website post-launch. Everybody wins.
Tutorial Videos
I have plans to develop a series of narrated tutorial-videos that will be available on the website. The videos will mainly contain a quickstart-guide on how to play the game.
While i can, and will, create the animations myself I will need to hire a voice-actor for the narration because nobody wants to listen to my eastern-european accent.
Manufacture and Prototypes
While I already have a manufacturer chosen, I want to use the funds to print large amounts of prototypes and near-release candidates to send to game-reviewers, as well as to deploy playtest-versions in RPG-stores in the area.
 


Why A Physical Product? Why A Card-Game?
Because it was something realistically achievable for me.
I picked a medium I can work in and realistically create a high quality product that people would want to play.
With Millennium Gravitas I am confident to produce something worthwhile that will add to the genre as well as provide a lot of fun.
 
*Project Next-Gen 
Project Next-Gen would be the next step in the evolution of Millenium Gravitas and could only be achieved if the game is tremendously successful.
The idea is to create a version of the game for the Android platform (Smartphones/Tablets) that integrates into the physical version of Millenium Gravitas.
When buying physical box-sets, boosters or individual cards they would be playable in the android-version of the game, online, or in local multiplayer.
Imagine having your deck always handy to play on your phone, with legitimate cards you purchased either physically or digitally, connected to the whole world.
The Android platform and mobile gaming seems like a logical step into the future for TCGs and CCGs.
The game itself would be free to download, cards or starter-packs would be sold separately, and of course you could add your previously purchased cards to the game immediately
Of course the 10,000$ goal from this campaign alone would not be enough to create this version of the game, especially since only about 4,000 would be left for this project.
However it would show tremendous interest in a concept like this and I would immediately start pre-production towards it with a release in the not too distant future.
What are the benefits of donating towards the 10,000$ goal?
I need to know that this interest exists to develop a system that will assign every physically produced card a unique, non-crackable code for the preparation of this digital version (else older cards produced before the android version would not be playable or addable).
I would also need to change my manufacturer and revamp the whole game in a way that prepares it for a future digital online launch as described.
I already have some concepts, but they need consultation with game-developers and programmers.
If the project doesn't reach 10,000$ it will show me that there isn't enough interest towards that kind of system.
IMPORTANT: The 10,000$ goal is not a guarantee for the creation for such a game, nor does it represent the complete amount of funding required for its creation.
It is a declaration of interest by the community of TCG and CCG players for such a game to exist, and provides me with funds to start pre-production.
 


How else can I help?
Share and care.
If you can't donate but find this game intriguing, spread the word.
Twitter, Facebook, Forums, get the word out there!
A temporary website has been made for the duration of the indiegogo campaign: http://millenniumgravitas.wordpress.com/
You can also follow the game on Twitter at https://twitter.com/millenniumtgc
Thank you all in advance.
 
About Me
I'm a Graphics Designer by trade.
Other than that, I am an amateur game-designer and enthusiast.
I have spent many years playing TCG and CCGs as well as board and role-playing games, creating my own rule-sets and settings for various popular RPG-systems like DnD 4e, Savage Worlds or Pathfinder.
While I do not have any experience in making games commercially, I find great pleasure in analyzing and reverse-engineering games and their mechanics.
Of course I put them back together when I'm done, in a different order.
It's a natural step for me to try and produce something that can be published to the public and not just played by a handful of my friends.

<p>Midnight Snack is a thrilling VR adventure that presents your childhood fears anew. After moving in to your new home in the town of Guisedale, it is apparent that you are not the only one occupying your room. Tasked with the mission to appease your mysterious roommate's midnight cravings, you must scavenge your house to bring back the tastiest of treats to your bedroom. However, at this time of night there are other dangers stirring in the darkness. In this house, no sound goes unnoticed and one noisy act of greed can be lethal. As you bring food to your hungry guest, watch out for your oddly acting parents who will stop at nothing to catch you in the act. If you find yourself in an undesirable situation, hide in cabinets and closets to increase your chances of survival. Above all things, make sure your guest does not go to bed hungry.</p>

<h2><strong>Why Squeezzy Mouse?</strong></h2>
<h3><em><strong>                                                        No more usual computer mice!</strong></em></h3>
<div><span style=""font-size: large;""><strong>Perché <span lang=""EN-US"">squeezzy mouse?</span></strong></span></div>
<div> </div>
<h3><strong>                                    <em>Perchè non se ne può più dei soliti mouse!</em></strong></h3>
<h3>English</h3>
<p><br/> The mouse was born, or rather, was patented in 1967 and is still the only undisputed pointing system used when one gets closer to a personal computer, personal computer specifically because if it is true that there are now other pointing device such example the touch screen, the same are certainly not comfortable to use when you are faced with a vertical screen.So the operating systems are  changed , the hardware are improved for all devices, the supports for the data have evolved from perforated cards to  the DVDs 2L, the printers are now 3D but  there is a piece that has remained the same, only the pointing  system has not changed much.Of course, it has gone from the wire and the ball to the laser wireless, you are given the most extravagant shape but in the end when you get close to a PC the hand gesture that runs on your desktop until you reach the fateful mouse is always the same, there are someone which imputes the problems even carpal tunnel to the act of moving the mouse resting on a desk, but there is no other system to move the small arrow on the screen.So one day while I was playing with an anti stress ball while working on the PC I said, sure that if you could move with the same stress ball also the arrow on the screen would not hurt, why not!? the technology is there, today accelerometers, gyroscopes  there are all kinds so why not do it and begin to give the ability to work both as a traditional mouse resting on the desk and in the air without having to bear away to force the hand and arm on the desk, maybe just the elbow? and perhaps between one movement and the other make some squeezed to the ball so just to throw a little 'stress!?We have thus developed the first prototype to figure out how to do, we put him in a tennis ball being similar in shape to our idea but already empty inside to be able to include a simple circuit, without fiddling too, so we connected the USB cable and we have seen that the idea is feasible.The Squeezzy Rechargeable Bluetooth Mouse is comfortable and has a funny-looking design. With this device you will not have to purchase any batteries. The USB cord is used only for charging the battery, not to connect to your computer. do not forget, it's squeezable!</p>
<div><strong>Italiano</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Il mouse è nato, o meglio è stato brevettato, nel lontano 1967 ed è ancora oggi l’unico indiscusso sistema di puntamento utilizzato quando ci si avvicina ad un personal computer, specifico personal computer perché se è vero che ora ci sono altri sistemi di puntamento come ad<span>  </span>esempio il touch screen, gli stessi non sono certo comodissimi da utilizzare quando si è di fronte ad uno schermo verticale.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Sono cosi cambiati i sistemi operativi, è migliorato l’hardware di tutte le periferiche, i supporti per i dati sono passati dalle schede forate<span>  </span>ai DVD 2L, le stampanti ora sono anche 3D; non c’è un pezzo che sia rimasto lo stesso, solo il sistema di puntamento non è cambiato di molto.</div>
<div>Certo, si è passati dal filo e la pallina al laser e senza filo, gli si sono date le forme più stravaganti ma alla fine quando ci si avvicina ad un PC il gesto della mano che scorre sulla scrivania fino a raggiungere il fatidico mouse è sempre lo stesso, c’è chi imputa addirittura problemi di tunnel carpale al gesto di muovere il mouse, qunado siamo poggiati su di una scrivania, ma non c’è altro sistema di muovere la freccina sullo schermo.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Così un bel giorno giocherellando con una pallina antistress mentre lavoravo al PC mi sono detto, certo che se si potesse muovere con la stessa pallina antistress anche<span>  </span>la freccetta sullo schermo non sarebbe male, perché no?, la tecnologia c’è, oggi accelerometri, giroscopi ce ne sono e di tutti i tipi, allora perché non farla e cominciare a dare la possibilità di lavorare sia come un mouse tradizionale poggiato sulla scrivania che in aria senza dover poggiare per forza la mano ed il braccio sulla scrivania , magari solo il gomito? e magari tra un movimento e l’altro dare anche qualche strizzata alla pallina, cosi giusto per buttare via un po’ di stress?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Abbiamo così sviluppato il primo prototipo per capire come poter fare, lo abbiamo messo in una pallina da tennis essendo molto simile per forma alla nostra idea, ma già vuota all’interno per poterci inserire un circuito elettronico,  abbiamo cosi<span>  </span>collegato il cavo USB ed abbiamo visto che l’idea è fattibile.</div>

It's a wireless mouse inside a stress ball.
Che cos’è Squeezzy Mouse?
 
E’ un mouse all’interno di una pallina antistress.
 
 

 
Why Squeezzy Mouse?
                                                        No more usual computer mice!
Perché squeezzy mouse?
 
                                    Perchè non se ne può più dei soliti mouse!
English
 The mouse was born, or rather, was patented in 1967 and is still the only undisputed pointing system used when one gets closer to a personal computer, personal computer specifically because if it is true that there are now other pointing device such example the touch screen, the same are certainly not comfortable to use when you are faced with a vertical screen.So the operating systems are  changed , the hardware are improved for all devices, the supports for the data have evolved from perforated cards to  the DVDs 2L, the printers are now 3D but  there is a piece that has remained the same, only the pointing  system has not changed much.Of course, it has gone from the wire and the ball to the laser wireless, you are given the most extravagant shape but in the end when you get close to a PC the hand gesture that runs on your desktop until you reach the fateful mouse is always the same, there are someone which imputes the problems even carpal tunnel to the act of moving the mouse resting on a desk, but there is no other system to move the small arrow on the screen.So one day while I was playing with an anti stress ball while working on the PC I said, sure that if you could move with the same stress ball also the arrow on the screen would not hurt, why not!? the technology is there, today accelerometers, gyroscopes  there are all kinds so why not do it and begin to give the ability to work both as a traditional mouse resting on the desk and in the air without having to bear away to force the hand and arm on the desk, maybe just the elbow? and perhaps between one movement and the other make some squeezed to the ball so just to throw a little 'stress!?We have thus developed the first prototype to figure out how to do, we put him in a tennis ball being similar in shape to our idea but already empty inside to be able to include a simple circuit, without fiddling too, so we connected the USB cable and we have seen that the idea is feasible.The Squeezzy Rechargeable Bluetooth Mouse is comfortable and has a funny-looking design. With this device you will not have to purchase any batteries. The USB cord is used only for charging the battery, not to connect to your computer. do not forget, it's squeezable!
Italiano
 
Il mouse è nato, o meglio è stato brevettato, nel lontano 1967 ed è ancora oggi l’unico indiscusso sistema di puntamento utilizzato quando ci si avvicina ad un personal computer, specifico personal computer perché se è vero che ora ci sono altri sistemi di puntamento come ad  esempio il touch screen, gli stessi non sono certo comodissimi da utilizzare quando si è di fronte ad uno schermo verticale.
 
Sono cosi cambiati i sistemi operativi, è migliorato l’hardware di tutte le periferiche, i supporti per i dati sono passati dalle schede forate  ai DVD 2L, le stampanti ora sono anche 3D; non c’è un pezzo che sia rimasto lo stesso, solo il sistema di puntamento non è cambiato di molto.
Certo, si è passati dal filo e la pallina al laser e senza filo, gli si sono date le forme più stravaganti ma alla fine quando ci si avvicina ad un PC il gesto della mano che scorre sulla scrivania fino a raggiungere il fatidico mouse è sempre lo stesso, c’è chi imputa addirittura problemi di tunnel carpale al gesto di muovere il mouse, qunado siamo poggiati su di una scrivania, ma non c’è altro sistema di muovere la freccina sullo schermo.
 
Così un bel giorno giocherellando con una pallina antistress mentre lavoravo al PC mi sono detto, certo che se si potesse muovere con la stessa pallina antistress anche  la freccetta sullo schermo non sarebbe male, perché no?, la tecnologia c’è, oggi accelerometri, giroscopi ce ne sono e di tutti i tipi, allora perché non farla e cominciare a dare la possibilità di lavorare sia come un mouse tradizionale poggiato sulla scrivania che in aria senza dover poggiare per forza la mano ed il braccio sulla scrivania , magari solo il gomito? e magari tra un movimento e l’altro dare anche qualche strizzata alla pallina, cosi giusto per buttare via un po’ di stress?
 
Abbiamo così sviluppato il primo prototipo per capire come poter fare, lo abbiamo messo in una pallina da tennis essendo molto simile per forma alla nostra idea, ma già vuota all’interno per poterci inserire un circuito elettronico,  abbiamo cosi  collegato il cavo USB ed abbiamo visto che l’idea è fattibile.

<p>The Rival Factions compete to fill the Central Committee with their supporters. The player who runs the Central Committee is The Leader!  There can only ever be one Leader, so it is important to understand the rules of the game and use them to your advantage! If no one player dominates the Committee then deals have to be done. Each turn players move around the board along the demilitarised zone which runs along the perimeter of the board and have to make decisions about who they support. It creates a climate of mistrust and intrigue. Decisions are determined by the number of cards players have in The Central Committee. Each turn can change the number of cards a player has and so alter their influence, as decisions have to be supported by a majority of the committee. Players have to manoeuvre themselves through the politics until one player has gained 20 brinkmanship points. Points are gained by taking control of the Committee, time as Leader and from doing deals with other players to get their support.</p>

<p style="""">At the same time the committee decides the level of international tension.  As public parades whip up popular fervour and brinkmanship is taken to a nuclear level so the opportunities for players to decide how to run the World's most secret State determine who ends up winning the game and who gets manipulated.</p>

Players then move along the track (called the demilitarized zone) and where they land decides what actions take place.  Actions can change the number of cards in the committee, place or remove parade cards on the Korean map, or require the committee to make decisions.  Decisions will be determined by both the cards in the committee at the time and the relationship  between the players.  <br/></p>
<p>This game enables all members of the family to play as it provides lots of times when ""i win you lose"" scenarios to arise.</p>
<p>Simple rules means they are easily mastered and that enables more sophisticated game play as players try to use the rules to get ahead.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/94652/files/20130925021143-North_Korea_Forces_map.jpg?1380100303"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Further rules including challenging the leadership of the Leader - making  regular decisions about who to back and what brinkmanship points to deal with  and nuclear powers - which gives the current Leader power to make the decisions the committee did, including being able to win a leadership challenge irrespective of the number of cards in the committee -  raise tension as players try to find away to either stay in control or wrestle it away from others without the wrong rivals taking control. </p>
<p>Like many rules there are designed to be interdependent, hence the committee makes decisions that effect the level of international tension.  At both extremes, ie too high or too low the scale has a ""war games"" space.  If the scale is on war games and all of the parade cards are placed on the map then war games start. This is a spontaneous battle for territory that lasts 4 turns and enables a potentially dramatic change in who runs the State.  This rule, like many others provides an exciting tension where players can predict what could happen next (within the dice roll) to change who is winning or what opportunities were lost to defeat who is currently in charge. </p>
<p>The game is very visual, so it matters where the players pieces are along the demilitarised zone, how many cards are held in the committee, what bonus cards are in the secret tunnels, whether the State has in nuclear powers or not, how many parade cards there are on the map, and finally the relative positions of each players brinkmanship points.</p>

8. Free APP
We have developed a free downloadable APP for IPhone, IPad and Android which accompanies the game.  The APP is not essential for the game, but offers an alternative to certain senarious in the manual game.  The APP adds tension and excitment at key moments of drama and decision making.  Specifically at Central Committee Elections your Image and Korean Name could appear on the APP to contest regions across the Country!  You can join the game by having your face on the APP, as described in the rewards section.",13.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We've had people from every facet of the industry reach out to help this project get on its feet, and we truly believe that there is something for everyone in this series. One of the creatives who has been integral in creating the <strong><i>Stranger Things vibe</i></strong> for the series is <strong>Rashaad Santiago</strong>, who actually worked on a demagorgon! Allowing us to bring a real HORROR atmosphere to Spider-Man content as he faces the terrifying Scorpion <u><strong>MONSTER</strong></u>!</p>
<p>Rashaad lent his talent to the <strong>Scorpion suit</strong> for the series, and what we came up with was truly terrifying! We wanted to shoot in-camera as much as possible <u>rather than</u> relying on CGI. We were trying to achieve that classic <i><strong>Sam Raimi feel</strong></i> with <strong><u>PRACTICAL EFFECTS</u> and </strong><u><b>PUPPETEERING</b></u>. So many people have left their mark on this series, and we look forward to showing everyone the finished product. </p>

<p>Brandon Melo is incredibly humbled to be living out his dream and portraying Spider-Man in the series. Brandon is a 21-year-old entrepreneur, actor, and model who has spent the past decade mastering his craft, but his idea of creating this Spider-Man web-series came when he was 19. Since then, he's spent tens of thousands of hours working to put this production together. With everything nearly in place, he's excited to finally show you all the product of that work!</p>

<p>Tina Bell is a producer, model, and actress who is thrilled to be playing Gwen Stacy in the series! Writer Justin Blackburn was extremely impressed with her audition on Backstage and vouched for her professionalism. Some were initially hesitant about the choice as many of her features (brown hair chief among them) did not match the Gwen from the comics. But Tina proved all the doubters wrong with her commitment to the project and the part.  Her love for the character brought her to dye her hair blonde, and she prepared extensively to bring to life this new interpretation of the character. She's done her research in and out, and became a comic-lover after working on Monsters Of Manhattan! She was honestly made for this role, and production couldn't be happier to have her involved. We can't wait for everyone to see her performance as the young, posh Gwen Stacy! </p>

<p>Erick Corvera's introduction to acting was through this project! He's been a long-time comic reader and was an early pair of ears for the series pitch (he loved the idea, and wanted to get involved any way he could!). After reading for the part, we couldn't imagine anyone else playing Flash Thompson! Flash and Peter's relationship is the backbone of the story, and it was completely believable due to his and Brandon's natural repartee from their years of real life friendship. Similar to Superbad, part of the purpose of the high school segments is to  show how friendships change though adolescence. The Peter and Flash relationship is so much more than the bullying that's shown in most films, and we're going to explore how Peter's superhero life affects his high school friendships. Since this project, Erick has been picking up commercial opportunities and is pursuing acting more!</p>

She's worked with professionals throughout the industry, securing multiple brand-deals with companies like Puma and Hasbro. She's a true professional, and her up-beat energy is truly infectious on-set. Creating a powerful female role model is very important to Christa, and she has pulled from multiple different comic-lines for inspiration. She hopes she does the character justice!    </p>

<p>We started this Indiegogo campaign to raise money for <strong>a passion project</strong> that has been years in the making.  The director and lead actor of the project (<strong>Brandon Melo</strong>) and his mother have been funding this series since day one, and since this entire project is non-profit, they're having trouble keeping up with production costs. The idea of not finishing due to budget constraints absolutely breaks all of our hearts, so we’re putting everything on the line to make sure this story can be told the right way.</p>
<p>If you cannot donate for whatever reason, the most effective way of helping us will be to <strong>share</strong> the campaign! <strong>Share it with friends, family, and Spider-Man fans alike!</strong></p>

<p>We are a small but passionate team of filmmakers who want nothing more than to bring one of our favorite characters to life on a shoestring budget. Our crew comes from a commercial and Netflix background, with YEARS of experience working on such Boston-based projects as Hubbie Halloween and Castle Rock. </p>
<p>We were heavily influenced by both <strong>Stranger Things and Cobra Kai</strong> to tell a story that balances a lighthearted high school tone with more serious themes. To us, Spider-Man has always been the story of one person trying his best to protect the people around him: his neighborhood. We want to create an adaptation of this classic character that inspires both old school and new school fans alike to have the courage to move forward in these difficult times. And we can’t do it without you guys!</p>

<p>Equipment-wise, we're filming on a Black Magic Ursa Mini (the same camera many Netflix shows use) with 35 and 50 mm Zeiss Lenses. It's pricey, but worth it. Our DP has been invaluable in helping us decide on the right gear to shoot this series, and we think we've landed on the perfect film package to give this series both the tone and <strong>EPIC</strong> look that fans deserve!</p>

</div></div>","Wouldn't you want to see a Netflix quality Spider-Man series like Cobra Kai and Stranger Things?
When a year-one Spider-Man finds himself caught in the middle of Kingpin’s plan to take over Manhattan, Peter Parker is forced to grow up, battle the demons of his past, and protect his neighborhood from his most monstrous foes yet.
This 5-PART non-profit PROFESSIONALLY MADE web series is an amalgamation of the everything fans ADORE about the character.  
Taking heavy inspiration from Sam Raimi's iconic STYLE, we'll be relying on a feeling of NOSTALGIA in our story, providing YOU, the viewer, with a new experience in our own ideal canon!  Tonally, think something close to Stranger Things meets Cobra Kai, balancing the MAGIC of adolescence with the HORRORS of the real world. Each 30-minute episode is going to be one AMAZING ride for both our protagonist and the audience!
ALL FUNDS RAISED GO TOWARDS PRODUCTION



We've had people from every facet of the industry reach out to help this project get on its feet, and we truly believe that there is something for everyone in this series. One of the creatives who has been integral in creating the Stranger Things vibe for the series is Rashaad Santiago, who actually worked on a demagorgon! Allowing us to bring a real HORROR atmosphere to Spider-Man content as he faces the terrifying Scorpion MONSTER!
Rashaad lent his talent to the Scorpion suit for the series, and what we came up with was truly terrifying! We wanted to shoot in-camera as much as possible rather than relying on CGI. We were trying to achieve that classic Sam Raimi feel with PRACTICAL EFFECTS and PUPPETEERING. So many people have left their mark on this series, and we look forward to showing everyone the finished product. 



IMAGINE... THE FANTASTIC FOUR, THE X-MEN, AND THE AVENGERS IN ONE MARVEL ADVENTURES UNIVERSE

Our story takes place in a COMICS ACCURATE MCU, before the Avengers were assembled, as Spider-Man takes to the streets of Manhattan to fight crime.

WILLIAM SHEWFELT AS JOHNNY STORM
In this world, both Spider-Man, F4, and the X-Men existed in Phase 1, and the topic of how to deal with the existence of superheroes is fresh on everyone's minds. 


The great thing about working on a Spider-Man project is the incredible world we have to play around in. With so many great characters to work with, we’ve managed to attach some very talented actors to the project who have helped bring this world to life!


Brandon Melo is incredibly humbled to be living out his dream and portraying Spider-Man in the series. Brandon is a 21-year-old entrepreneur, actor, and model who has spent the past decade mastering his craft, but his idea of creating this Spider-Man web-series came when he was 19. Since then, he's spent tens of thousands of hours working to put this production together. With everything nearly in place, he's excited to finally show you all the product of that work!

JAMIE COSTA'S EPIC RETURN TO YOUTUBE! STAR OF THE BIGGEST FAN FILM EVER

Wolverine Fan Film (100 mil views)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCyHmxMZQIQ&amp...
Jamie Costa is a familiar face to Indie-Gogo! He's starred in multiple high-quality fan films, including Wolverine, the BIGGEST fan film ever to go on Youtube. We're thrilled to have him on board this series as Shocker! He's like this production's big brother, and has helped guide us throughout the ENTIRE process. He's a huge fan of Spidey PS4, so he's seen just how devastating Shocker can be and he's stoked for his chance to portray him in this project. We can't wait for you to see his menacing performance! 


Tina Bell is a producer, model, and actress who is thrilled to be playing Gwen Stacy in the series! Writer Justin Blackburn was extremely impressed with her audition on Backstage and vouched for her professionalism. Some were initially hesitant about the choice as many of her features (brown hair chief among them) did not match the Gwen from the comics. But Tina proved all the doubters wrong with her commitment to the project and the part.  Her love for the character brought her to dye her hair blonde, and she prepared extensively to bring to life this new interpretation of the character. She's done her research in and out, and became a comic-lover after working on Monsters Of Manhattan! She was honestly made for this role, and production couldn't be happier to have her involved. We can't wait for everyone to see her performance as the young, posh Gwen Stacy! 
​


Erick Corvera's introduction to acting was through this project! He's been a long-time comic reader and was an early pair of ears for the series pitch (he loved the idea, and wanted to get involved any way he could!). After reading for the part, we couldn't imagine anyone else playing Flash Thompson! Flash and Peter's relationship is the backbone of the story, and it was completely believable due to his and Brandon's natural repartee from their years of real life friendship. Similar to Superbad, part of the purpose of the high school segments is to  show how friendships change though adolescence. The Peter and Flash relationship is so much more than the bullying that's shown in most films, and we're going to explore how Peter's superhero life affects his high school friendships. Since this project, Erick has been picking up commercial opportunities and is pursuing acting more!


M.J. WATSON'S TRANSFORMATION!
Christa Moore is excited to bring her spunk and quirky humor to this young, theater-geek Mary Jane Watson! Christa is a model, actress, and Brandon's long-time friend. She's worked with professionals throughout the industry, securing multiple brand-deals with companies like Puma and Hasbro. She's a true professional, and her up-beat energy is truly infectious on-set. Creating a powerful female role model is very important to Christa, and she has pulled from multiple different comic-lines for inspiration. She hopes she does the character justice!    

These are just a few of the many amazingly talented people attached to this project, and we look forward to being able to finish out the series with this incredible cast. 


We started this Indiegogo campaign to raise money for a passion project that has been years in the making.  The director and lead actor of the project (Brandon Melo) and his mother have been funding this series since day one, and since this entire project is non-profit, they're having trouble keeping up with production costs. The idea of not finishing due to budget constraints absolutely breaks all of our hearts, so we’re putting everything on the line to make sure this story can be told the right way.
If you cannot donate for whatever reason, the most effective way of helping us will be to share the campaign! Share it with friends, family, and Spider-Man fans alike!



We are a small but passionate team of filmmakers who want nothing more than to bring one of our favorite characters to life on a shoestring budget. Our crew comes from a commercial and Netflix background, with YEARS of experience working on such Boston-based projects as Hubbie Halloween and Castle Rock. 
We were heavily influenced by both Stranger Things and Cobra Kai to tell a story that balances a lighthearted high school tone with more serious themes. To us, Spider-Man has always been the story of one person trying his best to protect the people around him: his neighborhood. We want to create an adaptation of this classic character that inspires both old school and new school fans alike to have the courage to move forward in these difficult times. And we can’t do it without you guys!

Equipment-wise, we're filming on a Black Magic Ursa Mini (the same camera many Netflix shows use) with 35 and 50 mm Zeiss Lenses. It's pricey, but worth it. Our DP has been invaluable in helping us decide on the right gear to shoot this series, and we think we've landed on the perfect film package to give this series both the tone and EPIC look that fans deserve!

<h2><strong>Fight The Good Fight Productions</strong></h2>
<p>We are two women who met at a stage combat audition. A week later we were in our first production meeting for a play. We jumped without a second thought to create work for ourselves, other women and people underrepresented in the arts because historically, we haven't been invited to the table. <br/><br/>So we've made our own table. How? We create. We make projects with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Women bosses</li>
<li>Women focused stories</li>
<li>People of all different perspectives to represent the real world we live in</li>
</ul>
<p>WE FIGHT TO CREATE SPACE FOR WOMEN IN THEATRE AND FILM.</p>
<p>Keep up the good fight.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>The NYCSS in The Hunted: NYCSS</strong></h2>
<p>New York Combat for Screen &amp; Stage (NYCSS) has been providing the NYC (and tri-state area) with ongoing training in Screen/Stage Combat as well as quality Fight Coordination for Theatre and Film for over 10 years. Led by Jared Kirby it was listed in Backstage (2/17/15) as “A Stage Combat Class You’ll Want to Check Out!”</p>
<p>The goal of NYCSS is to create and perform extraordinary fights for screen and stage. This needs to be performed safely while making certain the violence appears realistic and truthful so the story being told is enhanced.</p>
<p>There is weekly training, a monthly 4 hour Seminar and a week long NYCSS Summer Intensive every year.</p>
<p>Jared Kirby has been involved in Western Martial Arts and Combat for Stage &amp; Screen for over 20 years. He teaches in New York City (and the metro area) and has choreographed fights Off-Broadway, Nationally, in London and Sydney.</p>
<p>As a Fight Coordinator, Jared has worked with stars such as Peter Sarsgaard, Steve Guttenberg, Cameron Douglas and has trained performers who are working on hit shows. Jared is a member of Actor’s Equity and SAG/AFTRA.</p>
<p>He is the president of Combat Con in Las Vegas, past president of Art of Combat, and served for six years on the  board of the International Order of the Sword &amp; Pen.</p>
<p>Jared currently teaches fencing at SUNY Purchase, Sarah Lawrence College and is a Master of Arms (Maestro d’Armi) through the Martinez Academy of Arms. Jared has an ongoing Combat for Screen &amp; Stage class in New York City and teaches at the prestigious Tom Todoroff Conservatory as well as the NY Conservatory for Dramatic Arts.</p>

He has taught at the Paddy Crean International Art of the Sword Workshop, the International Swordfighting and Martial Arts Convention (ISMAC), Rapier Camp and the Western Washington WMA Workshop just to name a few.</p>
<p>Jared is the editor and one of the translators of “Italian Rapier Combat”, the first complete, professional translation of Capo Ferro. He is also the editor and wrote the introduction for “The School of Fencing” by Domenico Angelo and annotated by Maestro Jeannette Acosta-Martínez.

The show highlights Asian-American storytelling and focuses on themes of belonging, xenophobia, community, young love, and more.It's a satire about a group of gangsters in Los Angeles that operate out of a mattress store and we're going to use many of the tropes and conventions of Asians in cinema to break stereotypes and flip them on their heads.The show started as a response to Hollywood's limited ideas of AAPI representation, but it has grown to be much bigger than that. The AAPI community has faced so much discrimination and violence in the events of the last 2 years and the community has felt widespread fear and alienation.Hapa is a show that has the potential to bring us together. Through this series it's our goal to empower the community and finally positively represent AAPI characters in mainstream media.We're looking to crowdfund the cost of production on season 1 of the series, including compensation for talent and crew, locations, equipment rentals, and for food our hard-working team. The more money we raise the better the series we can make.The project is led by TAKAYA ABDOU LLOYD, an Okinawan and Egyptian filmmaker and actor.  About TakayaEarlier this year my short film Egress was awarded by the Russo brothers in their No Sleep Til Film Fest, and as an actor I’ve had roles in projects like Legion (Marvel & FX), On the Verge (Netflix), and an upcoming feature film starring Machine Gun Kelly.My personal connection to the themes and story of Hapa has led me to passionately develop it over the last 3 years and it will be my 8th project as a director.

That rush of winning the jackpot, the neon lights, the catchy tunes and the funky prizes? Well look no further! Relive all the nostalgic feels, while being a backer of the comedy web series, Galactic Circus.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>The Epic Quest</strong></h3><p>When a group of eclectic employees close for the night, they find something terribly wrong… they’ve been locked in with no means for escape! They soon learn that this is a ploy devised by their immature general manager, Herbert, for their annual staff party. As he watches over them in a make-shift, Saw-like Escape Room, the staff members realise that they're truly in a Time Crisis and their quickest way out will be to play along with his ridiculous games. Each with their own reasons to escape (or not to), the staff members must attempt to work together if they have any hope of saving their Big Basses.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>The Series</strong></h3><p>The overarching story carries the universally relatable themes of family, loyalty and finding a sense of belonging. Each of our lead characters, although misfits in RL, are drawn to the venue in one way or another, but more importantly their fellow colleagues.

Littered with gaming Easter Eggs, GC will be wacky, weird, loveable yet strangely relatable. Inspired by what was once a real venue, Galactic Circus is a reprise of its glory days (or not so glory days).</p><p> </p><h3><b>Before You Press Start</b></h3><p>Taysha and Tristan first met each other at the original Galactic Circus venue in Melbourne as employees, where they developed a strong friendship. This continued on for years until they combined creative forces and became unofficial collaborative partners in 2014, and it was whilst in the midst of everyday workplace dramas and encountering strange characters, they asked themselves, ""What if there was a comedy series based on all of this?"" Who wouldn't want to know about all the crazy things that happen here?"" From failed Justin Bieber moments to exploding popcorn machines, they realised all the never-ending stories that could be shared. This was the moment that Galactic Circus, the comedy series, began.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1627652804/kuulc9m5beqcgijthhgv.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">(Galactic Circus Stock Room circa 2010)</p><p>Inspired by the very real friendships, diverse customers, workplace shenanigans and the wholly unique environment of an arcade, they realised how special the atmosphere of Galactic Circus was. Equally influenced by some of their favourite comedies including Brooklyn 99, Community, Futurama, Malcolm in the Middle, Modern Family &amp; Schitts Creek, and realising the common themes these particular series possessed (especially the concept of misfits united by a common circumstance coming together), they got to work creating the idea of Galactic Circus as a comedy series.</p><p>Drawing on the real personal experiences and stories, they crafted a group of original characters and with those came the ideas for the story. Even after the original venue of Galactic Circus closed down in 2016, they have kept the vision of bringing Galactic Circus the series to life. With a strong emphasis on nostalgia, home-grown content, normalising diversity, comedy and entertainment value, the development of the series has always been about capturing the essence of that special chapter in their lives, that was Galactic Circus.</p><p>Since its initial inception, and with the ever changing landscape that is online streaming content, the idea for Galactic Circus has evolved into its current format, which is to be a 8 x 6min episodic web series. However getting to this point was a thorough and challenging journey. Very early on, Taysha and Tristan knew that one of the most paramount aspects of the show would always be the colourful characters, and the need to have talented and charismatic actors to bring them to life.</p><p>Casting for the series began in 2019 and continued well into 2020. From acting workshops and improv meetings to casting auditions over zoom, they were able to assemble a diverse cast of local talent, who have continually stuck by the project and are ready to bring these eclectic characters to the screen. And it's not only the incredible cast who continually support Galactic Circus, but the immensely hard working crew who have consistently risen to the call of duty in bringing the vision alive.</p><p>Earlier this year, the cast and crew helped produce a major stepping stone for the series, when we shot the Proof of Concept episode over several weeks. The Proof of Concept episode was the first substantial time that the cast fully encapsulated and brought the characters to life. It resoundingly confirmed to all involved how much potential the series has going for it.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1627653072/xaf9upl9e0s9yq9jznlw.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">(Behind the Scenes Photography by Melville Quilliam (Fotografi Group))</p><h3><strong>Press X to Continue</strong></h3><p>Now armed with a Proof of Concept episode, a complete scripted season, drafts for future seasons, a dedicated production team and a great ambition to make the series fully realised, we are ready to begin the next major stage of the Galactic Circus journey.</p><p>Deep into the pre-production planning for the first season, we are passionate at bringing the series to you in 2022, but we still need all the support we can get, which is why we're launching this Indiegogo campaign in order to get the name of Galactic Circus out there and to raise some funds to help bring the project to you.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>Troubleshooting </strong></h3><p>We are always striving to meet that industry standard and maintaining a professional working environment for all our productions, and Galactic Circus is no different.

That rush of winning the jackpot, the neon lights, the catchy tunes and the funky prizes? Well look no further! Relive all the nostalgic feels, while being a backer of the comedy web series, Galactic Circus. The Epic QuestWhen a group of eclectic employees close for the night, they find something terribly wrong… they’ve been locked in with no means for escape! They soon learn that this is a ploy devised by their immature general manager, Herbert, for their annual staff party. As he watches over them in a make-shift, Saw-like Escape Room, the staff members realise that they're truly in a Time Crisis and their quickest way out will be to play along with his ridiculous games. Each with their own reasons to escape (or not to), the staff members must attempt to work together if they have any hope of saving their Big Basses. The SeriesThe overarching story carries the universally relatable themes of family, loyalty and finding a sense of belonging. Each of our lead characters, although misfits in RL, are drawn to the venue in one way or another, but more importantly their fellow colleagues. Embracing diversity and screen representation, we hope that our characters will be people that our audience want to befriend. Select Your CharactersHERBERT: The incompetent general manager, who loves the limelight. He’s a little over dramatic and has an excuse for everything. STACEY: The more level headed person, and although only 2nd in charge, is the go-to manager to get things done. She’s no nonsense and fair, but has a weakness for food. MADYSON: Our aspiring influencer currently has over 7k followers and 65k+ realtime views. She knows how to twist things around and get it her way.  Check out her Instagram and YouTube Channel! ESPEN: Is super meticulous in everything he does and longs for recognition. He’s a hard worker but with borderline OCD tendencies. GRACIE: She always sees the best in people and is a huge source of encouragement. As a cult escapee, she’s experiencing all that life has to offer! BEAU: Beau is a champion gamer and Herbert’s best friend. He lacks confidence when it counts, but is very loyal to his friends. TOM: Slick, suave and the coolest guy in GC. He is low-key super observant but likes to stick to the status quo. The Overlords Co-creators Taysha McFarland and Tristan Braines have gathered over a decade of experience working in busy arcades and theme parks. Combining this with the many years of collaborating on multiple projects together from award winning short films to even more ambitious productions, the creative duo are excited to merge these experiences together in order to bring this series to life. Together with the help of an incredible team and talented cast, we plan to bring you an authentic, heartfelt comedy about friendship, work life and finding a sense of belonging. Littered with gaming Easter Eggs, GC will be wacky, weird, loveable yet strangely relatable. Inspired by what was once a real venue, Galactic Circus is a reprise of its glory days (or not so glory days). Before You Press StartTaysha and Tristan first met each other at the original Galactic Circus venue in Melbourne as employees, where they developed a strong friendship. This continued on for years until they combined creative forces and became unofficial collaborative partners in 2014, and it was whilst in the midst of everyday workplace dramas and encountering strange characters, they asked themselves, ""What if there was a comedy series based on all of this?"" Who wouldn't want to know about all the crazy things that happen here?"" From failed Justin Bieber moments to exploding popcorn machines, they realised all the never-ending stories that could be shared. This was the moment that Galactic Circus, the comedy series, began.(Galactic Circus Stock Room circa 2010)Inspired by the very real friendships, diverse customers, workplace shenanigans and the wholly unique environment of an arcade, they realised how special the atmosphere of Galactic Circus was. Equally influenced by some of their favourite comedies including Brooklyn 99, Community, Futurama, Malcolm in the Middle, Modern Family & Schitts Creek, and realising the common themes these particular series possessed (especially the concept of misfits united by a common circumstance coming together), they got to work creating the idea of Galactic Circus as a comedy series.Drawing on the real personal experiences and stories, they crafted a group of original characters and with those came the ideas for the story. Even after the original venue of Galactic Circus closed down in 2016, they have kept the vision of bringing Galactic Circus the series to life. With a strong emphasis on nostalgia, home-grown content, normalising diversity, comedy and entertainment value, the development of the series has always been about capturing the essence of that special chapter in their lives, that was Galactic Circus.Since its initial inception, and with the ever changing landscape that is online streaming content, the idea for Galactic Circus has evolved into its current format, which is to be a 8 x 6min episodic web series. However getting to this point was a thorough and challenging journey. Very early on, Taysha and Tristan knew that one of the most paramount aspects of the show would always be the colourful characters, and the need to have talented and charismatic actors to bring them to life.Casting for the series began in 2019 and continued well into 2020. From acting workshops and improv meetings to casting auditions over zoom, they were able to assemble a diverse cast of local talent, who have continually stuck by the project and are ready to bring these eclectic characters to the screen. And it's not only the incredible cast who continually support Galactic Circus, but the immensely hard working crew who have consistently risen to the call of duty in bringing the vision alive.Earlier this year, the cast and crew helped produce a major stepping stone for the series, when we shot the Proof of Concept episode over several weeks. The Proof of Concept episode was the first substantial time that the cast fully encapsulated and brought the characters to life. It resoundingly confirmed to all involved how much potential the series has going for it.(Behind the Scenes Photography by Melville Quilliam (Fotografi Group))Press X to ContinueNow armed with a Proof of Concept episode, a complete scripted season, drafts for future seasons, a dedicated production team and a great ambition to make the series fully realised, we are ready to begin the next major stage of the Galactic Circus journey.Deep into the pre-production planning for the first season, we are passionate at bringing the series to you in 2022, but we still need all the support we can get, which is why we're launching this Indiegogo campaign in order to get the name of Galactic Circus out there and to raise some funds to help bring the project to you. Troubleshooting We are always striving to meet that industry standard and maintaining a professional working environment for all our productions, and Galactic Circus is no different. Galactic Circus is by far the biggest production we have undertaken and like any creative project has come with its own challenges.It's these challenges that push us to become stronger and more resilient film makers, to create quality content for everyone and create a community by bringing them together. We want to get this content out to everyone but we cannot do it without you.Biggest challenge is the delivery and we really want to bring the content to your screens!Even if mentioning this campaign to people by sharing to your friends and families will mean so much to all of us.Meet the PlayersDEAN GUNERA as Herbert GruberDean is a supremely versatile actor who has played a wide range of wonderful characters over his many years in acting.

Thank you for taking the time to consider donating to HUMANIZED, an original pilot for NYU’s Advanced Television Production class this semester. We couldn’t be more excited to introduce this project and the talented individuals who are working tirelessly to take it from script to screen.</p><p>HUMANIZED is ultimately about finding yourself. In this coming-of-age drama, a humanoid robot navigates the turbulence of high school while confronting the opposing realities of his identity and uncovering the twisted circumstances of his creation. Touching on themes of wanting to belong, self-expression, and strained family dynamics, this show explores the idea of “who you are vs who you’re supposed to be” through a sterile sci-fi sheen. While it’s both thrilling and emotionally gripping, what resonates most is its relatability. Haven’t we all, at some point or another, felt like we didn’t fit in?</p><p>By donating to this fundraiser, you’ll be helping us execute this project to its fullest potential -- one that is on par with industry standards. While NYU provides us with an allotment to get us off the ground, your funds would be appreciated for covering our extensive production design, transportation expenses, lodging accommodations, and meals for our cast and crew of over 25 people!</p><p>If you’d like to know more, we invite you to read a letter from our show's creator and meet the members of our team. We are extremely grateful that you are taking the time to learn more about this project. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>WHY IS THIS STORY NECESSARY?</strong></h3><p><strong>A note from creator Gabriel Guimaraes:</strong></p><p>Naturally, as many writers do, I put a great deal of myself into this story. No, I am not a robot -- although I certainly wouldn’t admit it if I were! -- but the experience of feeling out of place is unquestionably familiar to me. Growing up queer in a conservative community, I’ve dealt with the discomfort of feeling insecure in my identity, navigating conflicting parts of myself, and trying spiritlessly to conform to what I’d been taught. For me, having a media representation that externalized what I was feeling would have been beneficial. </p><p>While it’s no question that the number of queer representations in media is higher than ever before, quantity is not the same as quality. Unfortunately, despite the ever-growing amount of queer stories being told right now, there is still a severe lack of characters whose identities are developed fully and authentically. In many cases, their stories hinge entirely on the fact that they are queer, giving them incredibly two-dimensional storylines that fail to explore the intersectionality of their other identities/plotlines.

Thank you for taking the time to consider donating to HUMANIZED, an original pilot for NYU’s Advanced Television Production class this semester. We couldn’t be more excited to introduce this project and the talented individuals who are working tirelessly to take it from script to screen.HUMANIZED is ultimately about finding yourself. In this coming-of-age drama, a humanoid robot navigates the turbulence of high school while confronting the opposing realities of his identity and uncovering the twisted circumstances of his creation. Touching on themes of wanting to belong, self-expression, and strained family dynamics, this show explores the idea of “who you are vs who you’re supposed to be” through a sterile sci-fi sheen. While it’s both thrilling and emotionally gripping, what resonates most is its relatability. Haven’t we all, at some point or another, felt like we didn’t fit in?By donating to this fundraiser, you’ll be helping us execute this project to its fullest potential -- one that is on par with industry standards. While NYU provides us with an allotment to get us off the ground, your funds would be appreciated for covering our extensive production design, transportation expenses, lodging accommodations, and meals for our cast and crew of over 25 people!If you’d like to know more, we invite you to read a letter from our show's creator and meet the members of our team. We are extremely grateful that you are taking the time to learn more about this project. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you. WHY IS THIS STORY NECESSARY?A note from creator Gabriel Guimaraes:Naturally, as many writers do, I put a great deal of myself into this story. No, I am not a robot -- although I certainly wouldn’t admit it if I were! -- but the experience of feeling out of place is unquestionably familiar to me. Growing up queer in a conservative community, I’ve dealt with the discomfort of feeling insecure in my identity, navigating conflicting parts of myself, and trying spiritlessly to conform to what I’d been taught. For me, having a media representation that externalized what I was feeling would have been beneficial. While it’s no question that the number of queer representations in media is higher than ever before, quantity is not the same as quality. Unfortunately, despite the ever-growing amount of queer stories being told right now, there is still a severe lack of characters whose identities are developed fully and authentically. In many cases, their stories hinge entirely on the fact that they are queer, giving them incredibly two-dimensional storylines that fail to explore the intersectionality of their other identities/plotlines. With HUMANIZED, I aim to showcase a new possibility -- one that portrays a high-stakes drama while leaving queerness as an ever-present hum in the background. Hopefully, this show will help individuals who are underrepresented feel seen. Featuring a diverse cast of characters, it tells the story about self-expression, loss, guilt, friendship, first love, vulnerability, technology, and so much more. Really, it’s about the human experiences that shape who we are and make life worth living -- something that is universal to everyone.Now, as we prepare to shoot in late October, I couldn’t be more excited to bring these ideas into production with the incredibly talented team of artists that we’ve assembled. With your help and generous donations, we’ll be able to make HUMANIZED the show I know it can be: an honest exploration of who we are. MEET THE CREW!GABRIEL GUIMARAES - Creator/Writer/ShowrunnerGabriel Guimaraes is an NYU senior in Film and TV who is focusing his studies on TV writing.

<p><strong>So... who is Lauren Lox?</strong></p>
<p>Hi. I’m Lauren Lox, co-creator of <i>Making It</i>. I don’t actually go around and tell directors to change their whole idea in auditions, but I have made a faux pas or two in the beginning of my acting career, and that’s what this series is all about. If you liked the video above, fantastic! It’s the same tone as our episodes, so you’ll love the whole series. I could use your help to bring this series to life.</p>
<p>Seven years ago, after a huge hiatus from acting, I decided to jump into the film world. I had no idea how different it was from theater, and since then, I’ve also jumped into writing/directing/producing. Some of my short films have won awards like Best Director, Best Narrative, the Audience Choice Award, and Best Actor. All of my previous films have been dramas, but those who know me know I love to make people laugh, and it’s time to put a series out that will bring people joy.</p>
<p><strong>What the hell is <i>Making It</i>?</strong></p>
<p><i>Making It</i> is a seven-episode, short comedy web series about a girl who is BRAND new to acting and moves to Austin to pursue her dream. She makes hilariously terrible mistakes along the way to ‘making it’.</p>
<p>We’ve all made embarrassing mistakes in the beginning of our careers, and this series serves as a funny way to look back at the beginning of a journey to someone’s dream career. There’s awkward moments, funny moments, some tender and heartfelt moments, and yes, there’s vibrators involved.</p>
<p><strong>How much is she asking from us again?!</strong></p>
<p>While we have a ton of volunteers and interest in the project, we also want to do it right. So we could use your help to make this series the best it can be. We’re asking for $5,000, which will help us cover needed rentals, food, and editing costs. We plan to shoot this over 8-9 days and well, those costs add up. Our hope is that we exceed our 5K goal by a large margin so we can turn those gracious volunteers into paid roles and do <i>everybody</i> justice.</p>
<p>We’ve got some amazing perks, including a walk-on role for the series (secret perk for early donators), and script help from our co-writer and co-creator, <i>Kevin Bui</i>, who is an outstanding screenwriter based in LA. He’s worked on some Amazon and Hulu series as well as some top-notch features that have been greenlit. He's offered to help some lucky people bring their film ideas to life at a HIGHLY discounted rate.</p>
<p><strong>What's next?</strong></p>
<p>It’s my goal that upon completion, the finished series will release season one on YouTube, so you can watch it, cost-free, week by week as they come out. If we can rally your support there, we have plans to take this content and pitch it to make it into a full series. We love Austin, our actors and filmmakers here are genuine, and we hope to bring more projects to the heart of Texas. <i>Making It</i> was originally conceived as short comedy sketches laughing at our own misdeeds in the beginning of our careers, and those already on board find it funny and relatable. It has now evolved into a comedic short series with heartwarming and tender moments, and we definitely think it will inspire you.</p>
<p>If any of this sounds up your alley, please throw a couple of bucks our way and show your support. Even a small donation will help, but if you can't donate you can still assist us by sharing the video, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC92GsGiYShfyrkD1Yl8oQ-w"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">subscribing to our YouTube channel</a>, and telling all your friends. </p>

Instead, in ""The Donut Boyz"" we explore the unique backgrounds and challenges that Black men face today, but center joy and playfulness. The show will remind us that you are never too old to play or continue learning about who you are. We are seeking funds to film the Pilot episode of ""The Donut Boyz"". From there we will begin pitching to potential distributors so we can bring you the rest of the 9 episode series. We have a stellar crew of TV/Film/Commercial filmmaking pros and are thrilled to announce that principal photography will take place in Chicago!And super cool perkz? We got those too. Including opportunities to see a private, in person premiere screening in Chicago, customized raps, classes led by our key creatives, and more!Now, without further ado...
EPISODE 101: Beats, Bars, Beignets             It's 2021 and YOUNG JELLY D, now pushing 40, is still stuck in the late 1990’s. He is an Easy-E wannabe gangsta rapper with a dead end job who won't give up on his dream. He yearns for the glory days idolizing N.W.A and Mobb Deep, where he and his goofball best friends, “THE DONUT BOYZ”, roamed the streets chasing girls, making music… and falling just one hit short of a record deal! Unlike his homies, who have moved on and now have real careers and adult responsibilities, Young Jelly D spends his ample free time avoiding trouble, freestyling, and trying to come up with that ONE elusive hit song. Then one night, while he and best friend, and fellow emcee, RELLY-RELL, are running for their lives from Detroit Graffiti Task Force Detectives, that one elusive melody hits. It's everything they’ve always dreamt of -- catchy, provocative, bangin’. But will it be enough to convince GLAZINI and CAP'N CRISPY to give  up their comfy corporate lives and give their dreams one last shot?""THE DONUT BOYZ"" - THE SHOW:“Donut Boyz"" is a comic book influenced comedy centered around man-child hip hop crew leader, ""Young Jelly D"", who wants to give his childhood dream of signing with a record label one last shot. Knowing he can't get to the top alone, he convinces his college homies to reunite their hip hop crew ""The Donut Boyz"". Only this time, they aren't kids. Their careers, relationships and freedoms will all be at stake. They will have to learn a lot about themselves and how they wish to be seen in the world in order to catch real success. It will explore the way Black men from various perspectives unite around a common goal. The show will also bridge the gap from old school to new school hip hop using music from local and national musical artists and comic book style motifs throughout.What a great question! We are thrilled to say that we already have 80% of our budget funded! Mmm....yes! Thanks to our incredible and generous investors, we have most of our crew, equipment and post-production needs covered.This is where you come in! We are seeking $8,000 in funds to get us to full greenlit status. Your contributions will go to things like: Hiring the talent - Donut Boyz will serve as a highly coveted stage to showcase hot new musical talent and feature both underground and mainstream hip hop star power. Paying for locations - Only the best venues and sets for The Donut Boyz, son!Feeding the crew - And we are going to need donuts. Lots of donuts. COVID-19 Precautions - We intend to follow all the safety guidelines in place for safe film production under COVID-19. Help our cast and crew stay safe. And if we surpass 8k? We will be able to seek top name talent and hire more support on the production side to make this pilot the best it can be!From the bottom of our hearts, thank you!

<h3>Why We're Doing This</h3>
<p>Hey lovely people! We are Ali, Randa, and Dajanae, Nashville friends and actors embarking on a collective journey of storytelling. As fans of film and tv, we noticed that there wasn't much content out there that showcased people that look like us, at least not in a way that kept us grounded and three dimensional.</p>
<p>Let's do a test: ""Hey, think of the Arab character in Hollywood?"". Your subconscious probably went straight to Aladdin, or taxi driver, or terrorist. And don't feel bad for that! For decades, Hollywood has put us in a nice supporting character box, chiming in when needed. Only recently have Asians been in the forefront of film, or African-Americans portrayed as educated. (Thanks Ava Duvernay!) </p>
<p>So we wanted to continue that trend! We wanted to create a show that tells our story honestly, in all its glory and all its faults. And we wanted to do it through comedy, to poke fun at ourselves and the ironically satirical situations we've all grown up with. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Proper filmmaking is no joke. It takes a lot of committed and talented people to pull it off. Sure we can offer exposure to everyone but no one deserves to work for free. So the $9700 will go toward: </p>
<ul>
<li>Studio Time</li>
<li>Cast, Crew, and Locations</li>
<li>Camera / Lighting Equipment</li>
<li>Build Materials / Prop Materials</li>
<li>Food for everyone on set</li>
<li>Post Production (Editing and Music)</li>

<h3>What You're Impacting</h3>

Your contribution will see our story play out much farther than just the first 28 minutes.</p>

<p><u><strong>ABOUT  ME</strong></u></p>
<p>Hello, I am Will Ahrens, a longtime actor, writer and award-winning filmmaker living in Los Angeles. I have a great love for film and theater, so much so I earned a degree in each. I have spent much of the last two decades acting and directing on stages throughout LA. I also directed sitcoms in a summer educational program for over twelve years.  My short film, In Silence screened at over a dozen festivals all around the country.  All of that culminates in my creating Libra Lens Entertainment and it’s inaugural video project, Theatre Tube. Theatre Tube is a satirical mash up of faux documentary (ala The Office &amp; Modern Family) and a fledgling theater company mounting ""innovative"" versions of Shakespeare’s plays under the guidance of their fearless leader, Liam Lofgran! </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622518766/w9hnrxjxxfp5h2skvnsc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p><strong><u>ABOUT  THEATRE TUBE</u></strong></p>
<p>Theatre Tube is a mockumentary of  a small theatre company's process of mounting unique productions of Shakespeare's plays. Though it was conceived some years ago, the story for Season One, Romeo &amp; Juliet Go To Washington, took shape throughout the Trump presidency (which was a challenge as the longer I spent on it the more material I had to sort through). I was finally going to begin shooting in April 2020. Of course, we all know what happened then. However, in October 2020 guidelines were in place, with covid protocols, to shoot in LA. As the election neared and I felt there was a shelf life to my story, we started shooting. We finished the first three episodes planning to shoot the final four in November. Well, covid numbers skyrocketed shortly after and circumstances made shooting impossible. Now, as we are coming out the other side of the pandemic we have the opportunity to finish the season -  with your help.</p>

<h3>What's It About?</h3>
<p>A SAG approved drama-comedic web-series (and hopefully soon to be streaming network series) Cousins, Alex and Theo are struggling musical and theatrical artists. Although they are talented and passionate when it comes to music and theatre, they have not accomplished anything extraordinary in their lives. In fact, their lives are the epitome of ordinary. Alex and Theo struggle with their desires to pursue their dreams  while also conforming to traditional Latino/Immigrant Family expectations.</p>
<h2>Who are We?</h2>
<p>We are Albert and Celeste! We are the creators, writers, and two of the main characters in <i>Wasted Talent</i>. We met on set a year ago on set of a feature film and instantly connected. Our passions for theatre &amp; film intersected with our identities as first and second generation Americans ( and of course our super fun personalities, and great sense of humor), and from that the idea of <i>Wasted Talent </i>was born.</p>
<p>Albert just recently graduated from Muhlenberg College with degrees in Theatre and Media &amp; Communications. He has been part of various Film and Theatre productions across PA, NY, &amp; NJ, and has even sung with Tony Award Winning Actress, Kristin Chenoweth.</p>
<p>Celeste is a long-time PA native. After a brief hiatus from acting, Celeste appeared in the upcoming Amazon Prime film <i>We Fall, We Dance, We Rise</i>. She will also be directing a feature length pilot this summer entitled <i>The Nameless.</i> You also may recognize her as the baby in the beginning in <i>Good Fellas</i> (that's right she's a child-star that turned out okay). </p>

</div></div>","What's It About?
A SAG approved drama-comedic web-series (and hopefully soon to be streaming network series) Cousins, Alex and Theo are struggling musical and theatrical artists. Although they are talented and passionate when it comes to music and theatre, they have not accomplished anything extraordinary in their lives. In fact, their lives are the epitome of ordinary. Alex and Theo struggle with their desires to pursue their dreams  while also conforming to traditional Latino/Immigrant Family expectations.
Who are We?
We are Albert and Celeste! We are the creators, writers, and two of the main characters in Wasted Talent. We met on set a year ago on set of a feature film and instantly connected. Our passions for theatre & film intersected with our identities as first and second generation Americans ( and of course our super fun personalities, and great sense of humor), and from that the idea of Wasted Talent was born.
Albert just recently graduated from Muhlenberg College with degrees in Theatre and Media & Communications. He has been part of various Film and Theatre productions across PA, NY, & NJ, and has even sung with Tony Award Winning Actress, Kristin Chenoweth.
Celeste is a long-time PA native. After a brief hiatus from acting, Celeste appeared in the upcoming Amazon Prime film We Fall, We Dance, We Rise. She will also be directing a feature length pilot this summer entitled The Nameless. You also may recognize her as the baby in the beginning in Good Fellas (that's right she's a child-star that turned out okay). 
 
Sneak Peek!

 
We filmed out Sneak Peek in December and shared with a focus group, and received some really great feedback and love, to go forward and make a really great first episode for you all!

<h3>We Want to Change Hearts. </h3>
<p>In 2003 the writer of You, Me, and Goodbye was sitting on her bed wondering if there were people in the world who felt as lonesome and disconnected as she did. Being a teenager in a small town was hard, harder than it should have been. She searched for characters that were struggling the way she was struggling. You, Me, and Goodbye was born out of that moment. </p>
<p>It is our goal to make sure that if someone is searching to see themselves on the screen, they look no further than You, Me, and Goodbye. It isn't a caricature or the typical coming out story - it's about connection and following your heart. </p>
<p>We're an indie studio, based out of Oklahoma City, that is focused on creating entertaining content that uplifts and empowers our viewership. We recently shot the first season of our web series, You, Me, and Goodbye. Now we're gearing up for season two and we want you to be involved! </p>
<p>You, Me, and Goodbye follows two friends as they navigate who they are, who they want to be and how that relates to where they're going. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Join Our Community! </h3>
<p>The goal is to reach $10,000 so we can make the next season happen. We know that's a lot of money but that money will be used to help allocate the equipment we need, pay for a COVID safe set, make sure that our entire crew is fed and assist in delivering the quality that we know our audience deserves. We've got our cast, our crew, our locations and our story. <u><strong>All we need is YOU.</strong></u> </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We want to bring high quality LGTBQIA+ content to a wide audience, while focusing on the fact that our characters are real people, living real lives. We are interested in exploring the things that make us all universally human. You, Me, and Goodbye illustrates what it looks like when our friendships turn into something we aren't always ready for. </p>

It is our goal to make sure that if someone is searching to see themselves on the screen, they look no further than You, Me, and Goodbye. It isn't a caricature or the typical coming out story - it's about connection and following your heart. 
We're an indie studio, based out of Oklahoma City, that is focused on creating entertaining content that uplifts and empowers our viewership. We recently shot the first season of our web series, You, Me, and Goodbye. Now we're gearing up for season two and we want you to be involved! 
You, Me, and Goodbye follows two friends as they navigate who they are, who they want to be and how that relates to where they're going. 
 

Join Our Community! 
The goal is to reach $10,000 so we can make the next season happen. We know that's a lot of money but that money will be used to help allocate the equipment we need, pay for a COVID safe set, make sure that our entire crew is fed and assist in delivering the quality that we know our audience deserves. We've got our cast, our crew, our locations and our story. All we need is YOU. 

All funds will be allocated for production and post-production needs. Wanna see where it's all going? Look below! 

 

The Impact
We want to bring high quality LGTBQIA+ content to a wide audience, while focusing on the fact that our characters are real people, living real lives. We are interested in exploring the things that make us all universally human. You, Me, and Goodbye illustrates what it looks like when our friendships turn into something we aren't always ready for. 

Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't contribute, that's okay! Please share our campaign via your social media with your friends and family. The more people we reach, the more likely it is that we'll be able to create something special to share with you. Feel free to reach out and find out more about You, Me, and Goodbye. We're always here for new friends!
