<h2>What is Musicians Across Borders? </h2>
<p><strong>Musicians Across Borders</strong> is the non-profit outreach initiative of the summer music camp, <strong>Hamptons Music Sessions (HMS)</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Musicians Across Borders students come from under-served environments and areas of conflict, where the educational infrastructure is fragile or non-existent due to political unrest or budget restrictions.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>Musicians Across Borders sponsors children who are particularly passionate about their musical studies.  They are nominated to HMS through various outreach organizations, schools, and by individual teachers.  HMS then screens them via written application and personal interview (live or over the phone/skype).  The program has been such demand that <strong>there is a</strong> <strong>waiting list of 2 years already!</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2>What makes Hamptons Music Sessions special?</h2>
<ul>
<li>At HMS, students have the opportunity to study intensely with internationally acclaimed teachers and performers.  Check out our exciting core curriculum, designed by a team of educational experts:  <a href=""http://hamptonsmusic.org/schedule"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://hamptonsmusic.org/schedule<br/></a><a rel=""noopener nofollow""><br/></a>
</li>
<li>What makes HMS truly <strong>UNIQUE</strong> is the outreach component!  It's part of the fabric and identity of HMS.  Students from all over the world convene at HMS to study music at a high level, of course, but also to <strong>share and appreciate each other's cultures.</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>What will the funds be used for?</h2>
<p>This campaign is to raise scholarship &amp; travel funds for the students of Musicians Across Borders who have been nominated to attend HMS this August.</p>
<p>We know that there are a myriad of campaigns you can give to, and <strong>we <em>sincerely sincerely sincerely</em> appreciate your support.</strong>  Therefore, we like to be as transparent and specific for our patrons.  Here's the breakdown:<br/><br/></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>$12.5K is needed to fund 5 outreach scholarships</strong>: tuition for each scholar is $2500.  4 scholars are from NYC inner-city schools and 1 is from Tunisia.  We are also hosting 2 scholars from Afghanistan, their scholarships funds were raised during our spring benefit concert held this past April.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<strong>$10K is needed to fund the transportation costs</strong> of all 7 of our outreach scholars, 3 of whom are traveling from very, very far away and are dealing with very complicated visa issues.  We have secured permission from the governement and various embassies to host these kids at HMS, but it is a very expensive and complex undertaking!</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Impact and Magnitude of your contribution</h2>
<p>Your contribution makes a <strong>TRUE</strong> difference in the lives of the children we serve!</p>
<ul>
<li>Just imagine: how amazing is it that <strong>YOU</strong> can make it possible for a student from an underprivileged situation to make his/her first voyage ever to the USA? Talk about making dreams come true...these kids are so incredibly passionate about music.  Attending a program like HMS where their talents can be nurtured by top-notch instructors is truly a <strong>once-in-a-lifetime opportunity</strong> for them.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>The outreach scholars are not the only students who benefit from this campaign!  <strong>The entire HMS student body learns about celebrating cultural diversity<em>. </em></strong> Through this type of international exchange, everyone learns to appreciate different cultures and the kids learn first-hand about the unifying, communicative power of Music.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Double your dollar, double your impact!</strong>  This campaign has an incredibly exciting motor driving it:  an angel patron has pledged to<strong> match the ENTIRE campaign</strong> if it is successful.  Think of the impact <strong>THAT</strong> will have on our deserving outreach scholars!</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2>Our proven track record</h2>
<ul>
<li>Last year, we made it possible for one boy to leave his country <strong>for the first time ever.</strong>  He got on a plane for the first time ever.  He got to see the USA for the first time ever-  tried his first hot dog ever, walked the streets of NYC for the first time ever, and experienced the American lifestyle he had only been able to see in the movies.   After studying at HMS, he learned that it was possible to pursue Music as a career and is now a full-time music student back at home.  <strong>THIS</strong> is the kind of impact your contribution will have!<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>Visit <a href=""http://www.hamptonsmusic.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.hamptonsmusic.org</a> to see all of the beautiful testimonials left by our outreach students who have previously attended HMS.  In their own words, you can see the <strong>positive</strong> and <strong>lasting </strong><strong>impression</strong> that the HMS experience has left on them.</li>

<h2>
<br/>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>Help us get the word out and make some noise about this campaign:  <strong>you can help us by forwarding it to as MANY people as you can!</strong>  Every bit counts towards making it possible for an outreach student to attend HMS this August.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Fashion has long served as a mode of expressing identity and individuality, and for millions of women accross the globe it is also a means of equality and independence.  Social Fabric is a Fair Trade women's clothing company that bridges ancient cultural traditions with contemporary fashion trends to create unique and beautiful designs. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Social Fabric is run by a small team of dedicated creative professionals with backgrounds in Fashion Design,  Arts and International Relations.  Our past projects have taken us all over the world, working with grass roots women's organizations in Africa, studying traditional First Nations clothing production in Arctic Canada, and designing batik in Malaysia. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Last year we visited the Madihu Women's Organization in Sierra Leone where we found some great examples of western Africa's trademark mudcloth prints.  This summer we will be travelling to villages in Central America, India and Southeast Asia to connect with local artisans to acquire spectacular hidden textile gems. Through a collaboration with area tailors we will then design a complete collection to launch the label next spring.<br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Countless women around the world rely on traditional textile production as a means of self-reliance and to provide for their families. For women, earning an income has been demonstrated to help alleviate a variety of risks in developing communities, including susceptibility to trafficking, violence, and sexually transmitted disease.  Many of these textile producers are searching for a means of breaking through to international markets in order to create broader business opportunities.  This project will help provide that market.   </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In addition to upholding Fair Trade's key principles of economic and environmental sustainability, Social Fabric will also promote cultural sustainability.  Many traditional textile production practices are being lost to war, extreme poverty, and other factors.  This project will enable these women to maintain important cultural elements of their work and gain competitive advantage in the global market.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Social Fabric will also diversify the Canadian Fair Trade market with new socially responsible fashion forward trends.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are currently seeking funding to produce our inaugural collection to be launched in Spring 2012. The amount requested includes the purchase of handmade textiles, supplies, production labour, travel expenses and business start-up costs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The majority of the funds will be directly invested into products and labour in developing communities, including the production of pattern designs. The travel expenses will cover airfare, accommodations and local transport for two people at approximately $4,750 per person.  This travel is necessary to establish contacts and partnerships to ensure the ease of future trade flow.  The remaining funds will be invested in business expenses including website development, marketing and overhead costs at an expected $2,500. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The creation of the initial designs is the first phase of our business plan, which will be completed by September 2011.  We will then present our collection to potential investors in Fall 2011 to proceed to the next stage and expand our financial base in order to make the collection available.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Investors will benefit from fabulous perks including handmade goods, discounts on merchandise and invitations to the runway launch event.</p>

<p>My name is Caitlin Bergman. I am originally from the Bay Area and have worked in Education in the Bay Area for the past ten years. I received my Masters in Education from Mills College in 2012. I have been teaching for over four years in Oakland and Richmond.</p>
<p>This year, I will be teaching first grade in the Fruitvale District of Oakland. All of my students are students of color, who are learning how to read, write and learning about themselves. Many of these children are living in poverty and experience marginalization and violence daily, but, they also experience love, joy, family celebrations; and they all have hopes and dreams. </p>
<p><strong>The Project</strong></p>
<p>I want my students to be able to share and celebrate their culture, family and community, through photographs. I want them to be able to explore and share the positive aspects of their lives, school, and community. My goal is to support my students in feeling proud of where they come from, and that their lives and experiences are worth documenting, sharing and celebrating. I believe in the arts, and in students exploring themselves as artists, in this case photographers. These photographs will then be the inspiration for authentic writing and cultural exploration.</p>
<p>While I was teaching in Richmond, we used photography to explore various aspects of students' lives and families, as well as the local community. Students were filled with a sense of pride and purpose about their lives and the photographs allowed for authentic writing and sharing opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p>By donating to this project, and funding the purchase of digital cameras for my first grade class in Oakland, you are showing these children that they are important, their lives matter and are worth sharing, and that there are beautiful, positive aspects of their lives and community that should be documented and written about. We are having a community EXPO and the first grade classes will present pieces of art and writing about their families and community. I would love to use photographs and writing about the photographs in the exhibition.</p>
<p>All too often, these children are not given quality learning materials. I want to show my students that their lives and experiences should be celebrated and shared, and that they are worthy of using quality school supplies, and that their story and community can be captured through photographs.</p>
<p>Your donation will show these students that people care about them and want their experiences to be shared. It will show them that their stories are worth telling, that they need to tell them to the world, and that they are important. Please pass this project on to anyone else who may be interested. </p>

<p>2. Students in the USA who wish to study Chinese conversation, and so providing them with a sustainable income for their education.</p>
<p>The funds raised through this campaign will be used to purchase at least 2 computers, software, internet connections for at least 2 years, and a camera to allow the girls to record their life and illustrate the benefits they are obtaining from the technology.</p>
<p>If we exceed our goal of 3000 US$, this will enable us to purchase computers for additional girls in this village and other locations globally.</p>
<p>The girls we plan to support come from a family with very limited resources.

This summer, I have been offered the exciting opportunity to cross one of those off of my list. <br/></p><p>My name is Sydney Levan. I am a junior in the pre-medical program at Virginia Commonwealth University, but my academic career started at John Tyler Community College. During my studies at JTCC, I was invited to join the honors society for two-year colleges across the nation called Phi Theta Kappa, which required a 3.5 GPA to enter. Phi Theta Kappa proved to be a great resource for me as it helped my entry into VCU and offered many opportunities for advancing my education. The most recent invitation I received from Phi Theta Kappa was the most exciting one yet: an invitation to represent the United States in the International Scholar Laureate Program: Delegation on Medicine and Science. The program is very exclusive (invitation only) and a once in a lifetime opportunity to study medical topics in New Zealand and Australia. <br/></p><p>The purpose of this campaign is to help offset the costs of the program by providing funds for the plane ticket to travel from the United States to the program in New Zealand and Australia and back. The tuition for the program covers the cost of travel while in the program as well as meals and activities, but not the flights there and back.  <br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Goal: <br/>
</h3><p>My goal for this fundraiser is to raise the $1,800 needed for airfare while having a great time for my 21st birthday and St. Patrick's Day with my friends, family, and supporters. </p><p>I have set the goal at $500 as that was the minimum required by the site. The site will take a higher percentage of the funds raised if you do not meet your goal, so I thought $500 was a safe number that I could reach.<br/></p><p>If my goal is reached, any remaining funds will go directly to the cost of tuition, which I am paying for using the last of my student loan money. If my goal is not reached, the remaining needed will come out of my personal savings account. <br/></p><p></p><h3>The Event:</h3><p></p><p>I thought that a great way to get everybody together for a social event/fundraiser was to host a dodge ball tournament! <br/></p><p>The event will be held at XL Sports World (formerly RISE) on their indoor turf fields on March 15, 2014 from 12.30 pm to 3 pm. <br/></p><ul>

<p>Do
you wish that you could discover what you are wildly passionate about and build
your life around it? Have you already discovered your passion and wish that you
could have know sooner in order to have lived a life that was more ""on
purpose""?</p>
<p>Do
you know a young person (or a young at heart person) who is bored, unmotivated
or lacking self esteem, self confidence and a clear vision for their
future? </p>
<p>Trisha
Jacobson is a teen expert, teacher, coach, mentor and best selling author who has worked with teens and young adults in academic and health care setting for over twenty years. She currently coordinates the Teen Clinic, Community Outreach Education and Project Connect Peer Education programs at White Mountain Community Health Center in Conway, NH. Her County has the very lowest teen pregnancy rate in the country and she is proud of the work she and her team are doing to support that fact.</p><p>Over the <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">years of working with young people, she has noticed that limiting beliefs and lack of clarity around passion, purpose, life vision and goals often lead to lack of motivation, decreased academic engagement and increased risk behavior and life changing consequences, including substance use and unintended pregnancy.</span></p><p>When Trisha was first introduced to Jack's work at a live event in
August 2010, she was at a crossroads and considering a career change. But after the first day of the event, instead of planning her own future, she found herself going back to her hotel room after a long day in the
training room, unable to sleep, inspired and enthusiastically writing new curriculum for her fall classes and incorporating Jack's success principles into her lesson plans. As she realized how powerful subconscious limiting beliefs are in blocking us from what we want to accomplish in life, she began to see the connection between her work with young people and how they could benefit from mastering the power of beliefs to create the life of their dreams. This continued for the entire seven days of the event! Trisha knew in her heart and soul that she was onto something.</p><p>Jack Canfield has been teaching the principles outlined in his book, <i>Success Principles: How to Get From Where You Are to Where You Want to Be</i>, to adults interested in personal development, leadership development and business success for many years and participants have been breaking through blocks, reframing limiting beliefs, learning how to use the power of their subconscious mind and heart to create the life of their dreams while getting profound results along with increased joy and happiness. </p><p>Why aren't we teaching these principles to our young people, Trisha wondered. On the final day of the event, Trisha knew she was not alone. In his closing remarks, Jack stated his desire to get back to his teaching roots and get back to the classroom with his success principles work. In that moment, Trisha knew she would be helping Jack do just that.<br/></p>
<p>In September of 2010 Trisha began incorporating the principles into her health classes and in 2011/2012, she implemented a pilot curriculum in middle and high school health
classrooms as well as her clinic's peer education training program.</p><p>In 2013/2014, she developed a larger vision to bring this work across the United States and beyond. She began to explore <span style="""">collaborative partnerships with key stakeholders on state, regional and national levels, several of which are now in process. </span></p><p>The next immediate step is training a team of young people to help bring the curriculum, which is currently being developed, nationwide by beginning to train teachers, youth service providers, parents and youth leaders in the model.</p><p></p><h3><b>The Impact</b></h3><p></p><p>Here's what Trisha says about this project ...<br/><br/><em>""This project is so exciting! Did you know that studies indicate that 50% of adults in the US don't enjoy their work? Imagine a world where everyone was in line with their passion and life purpose; their reason for being here on the planet. This work has the potential to accomplish that ideal in our youth.</em><br/><em><br/><em>Jack's success principles provide a framework to help students take 100% responsibility for their thoughts, words and actions and reframe limiting beliefs and habits that don't serve them in achieving ultimate success and fulfillment. </em></em><br/><br/><em><em>This work helps to improve academic engagement, enhance motivation, support students in connecting with their unique purpose and their vision of personal success and so they can reach their fullest potential. </em><br/><br/><em>I see huge application in supporting decision making around risk behavior, thus reducing unintended pregnancy, enhancing academic success, and reducing substance use in young people. The success principles provides a framework for success along with the tools to eliminate limiting beliefs as they learn to harness the power of their subconscious mind to supercharge the achievement of their goals and clear the way to taking the action that will get them wherever they want to go and achieve whatever they want to achieve.</em><br/><br/><em>At the same time, Jack's Success Principles teach practical tools, skills and the mindset necessary for entrepreneurial success, which are critical to prepare students for today's workplace, job market and entrepreneurial opportunities they will face as they transition from school to career.""</em></em></p><p><em><em><a href=""http://www.trishajacobson.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Click here</a> to learn more about Trisha and what she's up to.</em></em></p><p><em><em><a href=""http://ow.ly/y1qsQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Click here</a> to learn more about Jack's Breakthrough to Success event!

She currently coordinates the Teen Clinic, Community Outreach Education and Project Connect Peer Education programs at White Mountain Community Health Center in Conway, NH. Her County has the very lowest teen pregnancy rate in the country and she is proud of the work she and her team are doing to support that fact.Over the years of working with young people, she has noticed that limiting beliefs and lack of clarity around passion, purpose, life vision and goals often lead to lack of motivation, decreased academic engagement and increased risk behavior and life changing consequences, including substance use and unintended pregnancy.When Trisha was first introduced to Jack's work at a live event in
August 2010, she was at a crossroads and considering a career change. But after the first day of the event, instead of planning her own future, she found herself going back to her hotel room after a long day in the
training room, unable to sleep, inspired and enthusiastically writing new curriculum for her fall classes and incorporating Jack's success principles into her lesson plans. As she realized how powerful subconscious limiting beliefs are in blocking us from what we want to accomplish in life, she began to see the connection between her work with young people and how they could benefit from mastering the power of beliefs to create the life of their dreams. This continued for the entire seven days of the event! Trisha knew in her heart and soul that she was onto something.Jack Canfield has been teaching the principles outlined in his book, Success Principles: How to Get From Where You Are to Where You Want to Be, to adults interested in personal development, leadership development and business success for many years and participants have been breaking through blocks, reframing limiting beliefs, learning how to use the power of their subconscious mind and heart to create the life of their dreams while getting profound results along with increased joy and happiness. Why aren't we teaching these principles to our young people, Trisha wondered. On the final day of the event, Trisha knew she was not alone. In his closing remarks, Jack stated his desire to get back to his teaching roots and get back to the classroom with his success principles work. In that moment, Trisha knew she would be helping Jack do just that.
In September of 2010 Trisha began incorporating the principles into her health classes and in 2011/2012, she implemented a pilot curriculum in middle and high school health
classrooms as well as her clinic's peer education training program.In 2013/2014, she developed a larger vision to bring this work across the United States and beyond. She began to explore collaborative partnerships with key stakeholders on state, regional and national levels, several of which are now in process. The next immediate step is training a team of young people to help bring the curriculum, which is currently being developed, nationwide by beginning to train teachers, youth service providers, parents and youth leaders in the model.The ImpactHere's what Trisha says about this project ...""This project is so exciting! Did you know that studies indicate that 50% of adults in the US don't enjoy their work? Imagine a world where everyone was in line with their passion and life purpose; their reason for being here on the planet. This work has the potential to accomplish that ideal in our youth.Jack's success principles provide a framework to help students take 100% responsibility for their thoughts, words and actions and reframe limiting beliefs and habits that don't serve them in achieving ultimate success and fulfillment. This work helps to improve academic engagement, enhance motivation, support students in connecting with their unique purpose and their vision of personal success and so they can reach their fullest potential. I see huge application in supporting decision making around risk behavior, thus reducing unintended pregnancy, enhancing academic success, and reducing substance use in young people. The success principles provides a framework for success along with the tools to eliminate limiting beliefs as they learn to harness the power of their subconscious mind to supercharge the achievement of their goals and clear the way to taking the action that will get them wherever they want to go and achieve whatever they want to achieve.At the same time, Jack's Success Principles teach practical tools, skills and the mindset necessary for entrepreneurial success, which are critical to prepare students for today's workplace, job market and entrepreneurial opportunities they will face as they transition from school to career.""Click here to learn more about Trisha and what she's up to.Click here to learn more about Jack's Breakthrough to Success event!

<p>Hi, my name is Autumn and I'm a Sophomore Visual Communications student specializing in design at Texas A&amp;M University-Commerce. After graduation, my ultimate dream is to eventually have my own graphic design company. There are many opportunities for most of the majors at my school to study abroad every year, but, every other year, my department joins with USM (University of Southern Mississippi) for the opportunity to travel to London, England to study at Kings College London. The program is called the British Studies Program and lasts for a month during the summer. I'm currently working on obtaining a scholarship, but while a scholarship will help, it will only cover a small portion of the tuition. </p>
<p>The amount that I need to be raised will help pay for tuition, airfare, housing, transportation, required museum visits, theater events, required academic excursions, and many other academic activities. This cost will also help pay for any supplies that I will need, meals, and travel expenses that will come up during the time of traveling to the other two European countries required for independent exploration. </p>
<p>During this trip, I will be traveling to London, England, Paris, France, and two other undecided European countries to learn about graphic design and its influence on culture. We will have daily tours to major sites, museums and neighborhoods as well as on-site visits to studios and agencies to learn about their design thinking and creative process. We will also be doing research on historic design at various institutions and libraries. </p>
<p>I think I’ll learn a lot of things about graphic design, its history, and the process of finding creativity through this program as well as personal growth. I also think I’ll gain a lot of connections through this program especially since it brings many universities together and it’s in a different country. </p>
<p>So in the end I am asking for help through donations to help me raise money to further my education in the Graphic Design field. I am really excited about the outcome of this experience. Even if it's just $10 that you're donating, it will help. It would also help to spread this around so that the word can get out and so that I can get even more donations. Thank you for your time!</p><p></p></div>","Hi, my name is Autumn and I'm a Sophomore Visual Communications student specializing in design at Texas A&M University-Commerce.

<p>I am a twenty year old college student who attended Drew University. Running into financial trouble for two semesters, I decided to transfer to Kutztown University. Already accepted and starting the process, all I need to keep costs down is transportation. What I need is a car. It's not easy to get a car when you're supporting yourself. Currently I take the bus system to get everywhere I need to go, but having a car is something that is needed here because Kutztown isn't accesible through any public transportation system here in Reading, PA. </p>
<p>I wish for everything to go back and learn, and for something like a lack of transportation to hold me back, kills me. Living on campus would just increase costs for me, and will keep me from keeping the amazing and stable job at a doctor's office I have secured.</p>

<p><strong>How could you help?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Donating <strong>ANY </strong>amount</li>
<li>Sharing this among your social network accounts</li>
<li>Spreading the word between friends and family</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p>All I need is a small car, something to get me there and back. No fancy stereo system, no added luxuries. I just need something to get my life back on track so I can graduate and feel secure about my future. </p></div>","This is Me

Already accepted and starting the process, all I need to keep costs down is transportation. What I need is a car. It's not easy to get a car when you're supporting yourself. Currently I take the bus system to get everywhere I need to go, but having a car is something that is needed here because Kutztown isn't accesible through any public transportation system here in Reading, PA. 
I wish for everything to go back and learn, and for something like a lack of transportation to hold me back, kills me. Living on campus would just increase costs for me, and will keep me from keeping the amazing and stable job at a doctor's office I have secured.
 
How could you help?

<li>Sandcastle Preschool Lead Teacher, 10 years</li>
<li>Philomath Outdoor School Director, 12 years</li>
<li>Philomath High School Cheer Coach, 4 years (volunteer position)</li>
</ul><p>I am an avid advocate of education - primarily, convincing students to INVEST in their education. I have a diversity of teaching experience from fostering social and academic development in preschool age children, to working in credit recovery classrooms, to mentoring college students as they become teachers. I am very passionate about public education and feel very passionate about education reform that keeps students best interests at heart. </p>
<h3><strong>Educator Tour: Dominican Republic</strong></h3>
<p>Last year, I was able to chaparone high school students on a global perspectives tour to the Dominican Republic. The purpose of the tour was to expose students to different cultures, poverty, and human rights issues. I cannot describe the impact this project had on me as a human and an educator. I also got to see the impact the trip had on the students I traveled with. We had the rare opportunity to visit two Bateys, a Batey relief clinic, an orphanage for children with HIV, a local dump, and a free trade factory. There were several heart tugging moments for all of us and it was an invaluable experience for all involved.</p>
<p>This year, I have been invited to return to the Dominican Republic as part of a limited group of educators. It will be an eight day collaborative experience centered on the theme of global education. I will have the opportunity to meet with local teachers, community activists, NGO’s, and Dominican citizens working to improve the lives of those living in extreme poverty. I will get to collaborate to create classroom activities and materials that will prepare students to live in an increasingly globalized, interdependent world, and to be active citizens in shaping a better future.</p>
<h3>Financial Need</h3>
<p>A grant will cover half of my accommodations while I am in the Dominican Republic, but I am responsible for the remaining half as well as travel expenses. These expenses total about $1500. Any amount toward my fundraising goal will be so very appreciated.</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>Traveling to the Dominican Republic last year changed my life. It was incredibly powerful to witnessn extreme poverty, diverse culture and students' personal and global perspectives change in a positively radical way. Being able to bring some of that perspective back to the classroom will be invaluable to student learning.</p>
<p>This experience does not simply aim to impart knowledge and skills, but to promote positive values, such as a commitment to opposing poverty and injustice, affirming human rights and cultural diversity, seeking a peaceful and just world and working towards environmental sustainability. I cannot wait to pass that wisdom onto students.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I believe in the power of positive thinking! So, if you are unable to support me financially, think a REALLY positive thought about me reaching my goal. :)</p>

I hope that God is doing as many wonderful things in your life as He is in mine. I just completed a wonderful year at Indiana Wesleyan, and am sensing God's will to do more for the world around me.<br/> I want to share with you a challenging ministry opportunity that God has presented to me. From July 20 through July 26, God has offered me the chance to go to Talamanca, Costa Rica, with a small group. This 6 day missions trip will involve construction and relational ministry. We will be reaching out and spreading the gospel to the Costa Rican people while also learning more about the people there and their culture.<br/> While God has opened up a door for me to develop a greater heart of compassion for His people around the world, the exciting part is that you will be able to share in this compassion in several ways.

I hope that God is doing as many wonderful things in your life as He is in mine. I just completed a wonderful year at Indiana Wesleyan, and am sensing God's will to do more for the world around me. I want to share with you a challenging ministry opportunity that God has presented to me. From July 20 through July 26, God has offered me the chance to go to Talamanca, Costa Rica, with a small group. This 6 day missions trip will involve construction and relational ministry. We will be reaching out and spreading the gospel to the Costa Rican people while also learning more about the people there and their culture. While God has opened up a door for me to develop a greater heart of compassion for His people around the world, the exciting part is that you will be able to share in this compassion in several ways. First, you can help pray for me and my fellow travelers. We will need prayers that God will prepare us for our visit and bless our efforts as we minister to the people of Costa Rica.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Sri Ananta Yogi.  About two years ago, I met Swami Shivananda Giri, who is responsible for guiding me to the yogic lineage to which I now belong and for introducing me to our now mutual Guru.  Swami-ji has played a pivotal role in the most transformational journey of my life.  He has helped open my heart to a universe of boundless love, joy, and bliss. </p>
<p>This coming July, on Guru Purnima, another student of Swami's, (Sri Brahmachari Ganesh) and I, will both be consecrated Swamis ourselves, by our Guru, His Holiness Mahamandaleshwar Paramahamsa Swarupananda Vishwa Guru Maharaj Swamiji.  We would not be here if it were not for Swami Shivananda Giri.  We would like for him to be able to make the trip from Charleston, IL, to sit at our consecration, which will take place at the Malibu Hindu Temple in Southern CA.  </p>
<p>This is no trivial or insignificant event.  It represents the formal decision and vows to renounce lifetimes of conditioned identification with the world, and with self-gratification, in favor of a lifetime of selfless service devoted solely to GOD.  Since Swami-ji has played such an important part in bringing us to this point, it seems only fitting that he should attend.  Furthermore, this may be Swami-ji's last opportunity to physically sit at the Guru's feet before moving to a new ashram in Belize.  </p>
<p>This has the potential to be a monumentally potent event, on many levels, for all parties involved.  It is my sincere and humble wish for Swami-ji, who has given me so much, to share this experience with Ganesh, our Guru, and me.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are estimating the necessary funds at approximately $900</p>
<ul>
<li>Swami's roundtrip airfare is going to cost about $570.  </li>
<li>For him to sit at the fire ceremony will cost $302, paid to the temple and the priests. </li>
<li>We will also need approximately $100 to cover his shuttle costs, to and from the airport and, potentially, a rent-a-car for the day of the ceremony.</li>
<li>Swami's lodging and food expenses are already covered (I will be hosting him).</li>
</ul>
<p>In honor of your generosity, we would like to point out the perks, both implicit in your service, as well as some tangible gifts as a token of our appreciation.</p>
<p>Any service rendered to holy men/women constitutes meritirious action: specifically karma yoga.  As any little bit helps, you can rest assured that your heartfelt donation - no matter how big or small - tips the scales of the universe that much further in the direction of your heightened consciousness and ultimate enlightenment/liberation. </p>
<p>Donations at the $25 level will each receive a scriptural anecdote, ranging from a couple of sentences to a paragraph, intuitively hand-selected just for you, and accompanied by a special energetic blessing.</p>
<p>Donations at or above the $100 level will receive a 12+1 large-bead rudraksha seed wrist mala.  Strung by me and blessed by Swami Shivananda Giri, specifically for you.</p>
<p>If we should fail to meet our goal, funds will go to completing as much of our objective as possible with the funds that are available.  For example, if the cost of airfare is met but the cost of Swami's presence at the ceremony is not, we will still fly him out to participate in satsang with our Guru and in the celebration associated with the consecration event and the Guru Purnima holiday.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Those of us who seriously devote our energy to an enlightenment practice believe that our liberation from erroneous mental conditioning, and our corresponding enlightenment, is the greatest gift that we can bestow upon humanity.  For every one of us that realizes that level of consciousness that is completely uncoloured by any sense of separation, the very vibratory state of the world itself is raised.  This event is one that has been deemed particularly auspicious toward the end of furthering that pursuit - by the grace of the Guru  - for three of the yogis of this lineage.  We, in turn, are ultimately empowered to pay it forward ourselves, in like fashion.  </p>
<p>In addition to benefitting the world and its inhabitatants by way of spiritual osmosis, as it were, this and other such activities are directly beneficial to those who contribute.  As mentioned above, the opportunity to provide selfless service is potent spiritual practice.  This is an opportunity to directly advance one's own spiritual progress.  The key is to - first and foremost - regard your contribution as service to GOD.  Contemplation in this manner and service dedicated with this intention are high yoga - Where simply giving what you are comfortably able will undoubtedly bear fruit.  </p>
<p>Please know that this opportunity to serve Swami-ji is only that: an opportunity.  His own service - and that of all of us belonging to this lineage -  has no strings attached.  Our job is to serve the sincere seeker and we promise to render this service, toward the goal of self-realization, to the greatest extent that we are able.</p>

<p align=""center"">by <em>Russell Cutts</em></p>
<p>            As you know, a passion of mine is the study of fire. In particular, 'stone age fire'; how our ancestors made, used and integrated it into our livelihoods.  I've even pondered the ""how?"" of their discovery: when did our ancestors first overcome their fear of fire, and even <em>salivate</em> (!) at the smell of woodsmoke?  What happened -- so long ago -- that <strong><em>first time</em></strong> a human realized...<em>I just made that ember...</em></p>
<p>            And, as you may know, it's been my good fortune to find a berth at UGA studying for my PhD in anthropology.  It's been a challenging year, and I've learned a lot.  I am so thankful to be where I am, right now; I am so deeply grateful for my family, and friends.  Many of you are mentors, or companions who've studied fire with me!  I have some delightful news: <strong><em>A Dream Come True.</em></strong></p>
<p>            In pursuit of my dreams, I recently applied to participate with scientists studying at Koobi Fora, Lake Turkana, Kenya.  <strong>I was accepted</strong>.  Many of you will recognize Koobi Fora as a <em>UNESCO World Heritage Site</em>, often referred to as the 'Cradle of Mankind'.  The <em>humans</em> and their ancestors who lived there are amongst the most celebrated of fossil hominids recovered.  Working with paleoanthropologists from the Smithsonian Institution, The George Washington University, the University of Witwatersrand and the Max Planck Institute will be my start to truly, for the first time in my life, be able to visit those ancient sites and, first-hand, participate in investigating the biocultural revolution of our species.  I cannot exaggerate my excitement!</p>
<p>            In pursuit of this dream, I am asking for your assistance: <em>please help me go to Kenya!</em> If need be, I will borrow money to do this.  But first, I want to ask you to donate.  I do not need much, from any one of you.  I am asking you to give $20 or $100.  Or $15.  Or $50, or $5!  Donate to your ability!  As we have supported each other <em>so often</em> in the past, I continue to believe you are genuinely interested in what I work to do (<strong>celebrate human creativity, diversity and innovation</strong>), and will want to support me in this!  I think you would enjoy hearing about my studies, and what I learned; I think you would appreciate <em>receiving a DVD</em> of slides and film of my time in Africa!  I hope you would like a <em>copy</em> of the 2nd Edition of <em>WildFire - Fire Making Art</em> (intended to be a product of this work)!</p>
<p>            Will you help me achieve my African studies, in exchange for a fire-kit, or DVD, or 2nd Edition of <em>WildFire</em>?</p>
<p>            I hope to find the funds for this work from you, my family and friends.  Rest assured, even in these challenging economic times, <em>any donation</em> you can make will assist me in securing what further funds might be required.  I have provided the budget for these studies, so as to be transparent how your money will be spent.  As you know, I <em>do have</em> the ability to live simply ;-)  a little can go a long way for Russ.  I <em>thank you</em> so much for your ongoing support!  And I look forward to sharing what I learn of fire, with you!   </p>

<p>$5,985 Tuition -- I will receive credit hours towards my PhD!</p>

She’s marched in parades and thrown coins at the kids, saying, “Hey! You! Stay smart and don’t start!” She’s written articles, published books and made videos. She gives away more than she charges for… a lousy business plan, but she says it feels too good to do otherwise.  <br/><br/>As a result of this obsession - this <strong>tobactivism</strong> - she’s burned through her own funds, leaned on and abused the kindness of friends, and in 2013, Nicci Tina may have to get A RESPECTABLE JOB - and she might end up working with YOU or with someone you love, and you don’t want that - trust me - because she’s restless, she’s volatile, and the work she was MADE to do - BORN to do - is streetwalking.  </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Giving Liberian youth a voice for their own issues and ownership of their art.  Working at 5 program sites across Monrovia and Mt. Barclay, with approximately 300 children, we will build on our 3 year legacy of writing an original play with music and dance that focuses on community issues and change from the youth perspective.  Many of our participants are orphans or high-risk in other ways due to 14 years of civil war.  Inconsistent education and no access to arts training has left these children with a void and a need to express their greatest concerns.  </p>
<p>Program Director, Jasmine Blanks, Harford County, Maryland, USA music teacher, MPP University of Minnesota, BS Music Education Florida A&amp;M University, has run this program through small contributions and grants for two years.  This year's expanded partnership with Liberian government entities including the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Youth and Sports, and University of Liberia, aims to train 20 Liberian young adults to lead 5 program sites in this tested program model that teaches literacy and math through the artistic process of play-writing using the Public Achievement model of community organizing.  </p>
<p>B4 (Burning Barriers, Building Bridges) Youth Theatre has received commendation from US-based organizations including Samaritan's Purse,  and the President of Liberia, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf for its impact for youth in Liberian communities.</p>
<p>Contributions make it possible to:</p>
<p>1- Train 20 young adults during a 2 week seminar</p>
<p>2- Run an 8 week program for 300 youth across 5 program sites</p>
<p>3- Write an original play on issues of importance to Liberian youth</p>
<p>4- Hold 5 community performances and a cumulative performance at Monrovia City Hall, the largest performance venue in Liberia</p>
<p>5- Produce a high-quality DVD of the performance with documentary segments</p>
<p>6- Hold round table discussions between program sites for youth development and community empowerment on these issues</p>
<p>7- Enable youth to share their concerns with Liberian government officials </p>
<p>8-Become officially established as a 501c3 so that we can reach a variety of contributors</p>

<h3>The Impact </h3>
<h3><em>""Ms. Jasmine has shown us how to use our talents to make a difference in our communities"" Sam (2010 participant and 2011 Junior Arts Instructor, age 16)</em></h3>
<p><strong><em>Need</em></strong><br/>As Liberia forges ahead with its development agenda, there are many new buildings and roads. However, there is a lack of quality programs to meet the needs of high risk youth. This is particularly evident during the months of vacation from school. If we are to combat growing rates of teen pregnancy and violence and increase rates of school completion and youth civic participation, young people need an avenue for expressing themselves where they feel valued and encouraged while learning new skills. This kind of program also needs to be sustainable by the people of Liberia in order to grow and provide rich artistic and educational experiences for youth seeking guidance at a time when they normally would have limited supervision.</p>
<p>Secondly, the arts are absent from educational settings in Liberia, and there are few, if any opportunities for the study of music, dance and theatre. Without these opportunities for young people, any Liberian desiring to achieve a professional level of performance will have to seek training outside of Liberia.</p>
<p><br/>Finally, young adults who are currently jobless due to lack of skills after years of destructive war are seeking opportunities for growth and service to their communities. Training programs designed to serve high-risk children provide a direct opportunity for service while participants are learning basic skills in youth development, recreational programming, and education provision.</p>
<p><em><strong>Burning Barriers, Building Bridges (B4)</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Program History 2009-2011</strong></em></p>
<p>In 2009, Director Jasmine Blanks heard President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf speak about the ""Education Drive for Liberian Youth"" and immediately felt connected to the need of Liberia's youth.  A student at the Humphrey Institute for Public Affairs, Ms. Blanks met with then Inspector General for Liberia, Marc Amblard, and Director of Liberian NGO Touching Humanity in Need of Kindness (THINK) Inc., Rosana Schaack, to create a plan for a pilot of an arts intergration program for Liberian youth.</p>
<p>In 2010, 40 children from the Children’s Rescue Outreach Center Orphanage Mission in Mt. Barclay, Liberia participated in the 2010 program of Burning Barriers, Building Bridges. 24 of these children wrote and performed an original play with music and dance. This process lasted seven weeks, and the final performance was held at City Hall in Monrovia during the eighth week. Among approximately 300 audience members, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and other government officials were in attendance.</p>
<p><br/>This performance resulted in approximately $1500 in donations that were used to pay program costs, as well as, school fees for some of the children. Additionally, the children were invited to attend a special lunch with the President.</p>
<p><br/>Since the summer 2010 program, there have been continued cross-cultural literacy efforts between the children at the Children’s Rescue Outreach Center Orphanage Mission and children in school in Covington, GA, USA and their first original play has been analyzed for its literary content by students in Harford County, Maryland. Liberian and American newspapers have covered aspects of this program. The play has been broadcast on Liberian television with advertisements on radio stations.</p>
<p><br/>In 2011, we partnered with Calvary Empowerment Team’s Vacation Camp to provide arts education for an additional 60 children. Between the two program sites (Sinkor and Mt. Barclay), <strong>120 children were served</strong>. The original site from Mt. Barclay retained and improved upon the information they learned in math, literacy and the arts from the previous year as evidenced in written pre-test scores and performance assessments during the first week. Children from both sites were excited to voice their concerns through theatre as they felt that the concerns of young people are often overlooked. Two performances were held; one at Tubman High School in Sinkor and the other in Mt. Barclay at the orphanage. Participants had combined rehearsals in the final week and performed at both locations together thus <em>bridging</em> these two communities and exposing the children to the collaborative spirit of performing arts.</p>
<p>Additionally, three previous participants from Mt. Barclay are trained as Junior Arts Instructors. Here they learned elements of program design, curriculum and instruction, and a variety of pedagogical methods in the arts.</p>
<p>Skills gained by youth: Increase in ability to do basic math with fractions and some algebra, improved writing skills and grammar, better command of theatrical performance, ability to compose 2 and 3 part musical selections, ability to choreograph short dance numbers with transitions for large and small groups.  </p>

Barclay, Liberia participated in the 2010 program of Burning Barriers, Building Bridges. 24 of these children wrote and performed an original play with music and dance. This process lasted seven weeks, and the final performance was held at City Hall in Monrovia during the eighth week. Among approximately 300 audience members, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and other government officials were in attendance.
This performance resulted in approximately $1500 in donations that were used to pay program costs, as well as, school fees for some of the children. Additionally, the children were invited to attend a special lunch with the President.
Since the summer 2010 program, there have been continued cross-cultural literacy efforts between the children at the Children’s Rescue Outreach Center Orphanage Mission and children in school in Covington, GA, USA and their first original play has been analyzed for its literary content by students in Harford County, Maryland. Liberian and American newspapers have covered aspects of this program. The play has been broadcast on Liberian television with advertisements on radio stations.
In 2011, we partnered with Calvary Empowerment Team’s Vacation Camp to provide arts education for an additional 60 children. Between the two program sites (Sinkor and Mt. Barclay), 120 children were served. The original site from Mt. Barclay retained and improved upon the information they learned in math, literacy and the arts from the previous year as evidenced in written pre-test scores and performance assessments during the first week. Children from both sites were excited to voice their concerns through theatre as they felt that the concerns of young people are often overlooked. Two performances were held; one at Tubman High School in Sinkor and the other in Mt. Barclay at the orphanage. Participants had combined rehearsals in the final week and performed at both locations together thus bridging these two communities and exposing the children to the collaborative spirit of performing arts.
Additionally, three previous participants from Mt. Barclay are trained as Junior Arts Instructors. Here they learned elements of program design, curriculum and instruction, and a variety of pedagogical methods in the arts.
Skills gained by youth: Increase in ability to do basic math with fractions and some algebra, improved writing skills and grammar, better command of theatrical performance, ability to compose 2 and 3 part musical selections, ability to choreograph short dance numbers with transitions for large and small groups.  
""We are becoming better people for tomorrow"" Deborah (2010 and 2011 participant, age 11)

<p>Hey, there! I'm Shanaya Stephenson, a high school student from Atlanta, Georgia. Recently however, I became much more than your average high schoool student when I won a U.S. Department of State sponsored scholarship to go on a program known as <strong>Kennedy-Lugar Youth Exchange &amp; Study Abroad </strong>(K-L YES Abroad). Through this program, I will receive the opportunity to act as a youth ambassador for the next 10 months to Oman, a beautiful Middle Eastern country on the edge of the Arabian Peninsula.</p>

<p>According to this graphic by Connect All Schools, <strong>only 1 in 10, 800 US high school students study</strong> abroad on a year or semester program, and of those, <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">less</span> than 25% are minority students</strong>. In a rapidly globalizing world and economy, a universal mindset is becoming increasingly valuable. The abilities to speak a foreign language, understand another culture, and adapt well in a new environment are quickly becoming standard skills, and without them, <strong>many students will lose their ability to compete with foreigners</strong> who are doing<em> just that </em>in our future job market.</p>
<p>As a result of noticing this gap in our education, I've decided to start an exchange student resource website geared towards getting U.S. high school students, especially minorities, interested and involved in study abroad exchange programs. It's called <strong>The Curly Muscateer</strong>, named for where I'll be staying, Muscat, Oman, and my naturally curly hair that makes me stand out!

<p>Study abroad gives students the opportunity to acquire these skills at a young age, and allows them to put their knowledge to use in their daily lives post-exchange.

<li>
<strong>Research</strong>: I hope to fully expand the blog site, and turn it into a big landing pad for exchangers. For example, I currently have a page on The Curly Muscateer blog that lists a few of the popular exchange scholarships. I will add many more opportunities and fellowships that would work for even young adults in college, among other things! In addition, I hope to add helpful articles and tips for the students.

<li>
<strong>Video blogs and Photos</strong>: My work on The Curly Muscateer will be highly concentrated on the video blogs and media. I've done some small vlogs already and have had a positive reaction! From experience, it makes the interaction with the viewer highly personal &amp; more relateable. Therefore, it will bring in more prospective students.

<h2 class=""short-blurb""><strong>The Yellow Finch Autism Project is a workshop dedicated to serving the autistic community in the metro NY/CT area.</strong></h2>
</div>
<div class=""full-description"">
<p>Autism has touched all of our lives in different ways.  One of the huge challenges faced by parents and educators, is giving children with autism the tools they need to express themselves, and communicate with the rest of the world.  Within the education system, there are curriculums, tests, and applied knowledge.  Often times, children on the autistic spectrum are not given many opportunities to participate in spontaneity, interaction, and emotion as enjoyable experiences.  That's where the Yellow Finch Autism Project comes in.</p>
<p>In 2006, Jacqui Russell of the Chicago Children’s Theater and London’s Oily Cart Company developed a multi-sensory installation performance for children with autism. ""The Red Kite Project"" continues to create new theatrical experiences in the Chicago area. Red Kite also created a framework that incorporates theater games with educational-based learning called ""Dramatime"". Red Kite Dramatime is a pilot project that places theater professionals and children on the autistic spectrum in a unique performance and discovery production.  </p>
<p>Our primary goal with this project is to bring Red Kite Dramatime to our community and give this experience to children whose development has been affected by autistic spectrum disorders.</p>
<p>To see how these children become involved is something very unique and rewarding.  Parents who are wary of bringing their kids to any kind of social gathering are amazed to see their kids interacting with each other and with the actors onstage.  Children are celebrated in Red Kite shows, and the autism becomes just one of the many things that make them special.  </p>
<p>We are going to continue that vision in our community.</p>
<p>With this money, we are going to bring Jacqui and members of her Red Kite team to New York for an intensive four-day teacher/performer training workshop, culminating with members of our community bringing Dramatime into a classroom of special needs children. Everyone on our staff is volunteering, and the money will be used for travel expenses, training materials and educational fees.  </p>
<p>That final day in the classroom is something that we have been looking forward to, and have been talking about since we first learned of the Red Kite Project over a year ago.</p>

<h3>Doula in Training</h3>
<p>Aloha my name is Asheeliyah, many of you know me as Shelly. I was born and raised in Moab Utah, my beautiful desert homeland. I am currently setting roots in Maui Hawaii actively participating in and organizing various conscious community gatherings, festivals, and events.  As I align with my highest calling as a healer, I find myself in a very rested, heart resonate space eager to share my natural gifts through bodywork, inspiring song, dance, play and education.  </p>
<p>I'm feeling called to dive deeply into learning and gaining first hand experiences with these sacred birthing practices in honour of the Divine Feminine and the rebalancing of the masculine and feminine energies. A doula works along side with physicians, midwives, nurses and with whomever is chosen to be part of a womans birthing team. Doulas can also help by providing information and support in the pre-natal and postpartum periods. There is growing evidence that labor support is the missing component in maternal and child health care. I'm choosing to maintain these ancient practices of holding ceremony for childbirth, providing our children with a proper welcoming into the world.</p>
<p>The training I am raising money for is through Barabara Essman's Sacred Birthing School. June 10th-July15th 2013.  </p>
<p><a href=""http://www.sacredbirthing.com/vision-and-mission/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.sacredbirthing.com/vision-and-mission/</a></p>
<p>""Sacred Birthing realigns birth with the Intelligence of Natural Law. By birthing softly, babies remain conscious, and remember that they are beings of love, never losing their conscious connection to their higher nature. Each newborn radiating this coherence transforms its family, community, nation and world.</p>
<p><span><span><span>The program consists of completing a 13 week course of study under an experienced doula and receiving supervision while completing the requirements for certification. Once certified as a doula, I will have opportunities to make home visits and assist with gathering a community of support around a sister and her partner preparing to give birth birth.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I've also been holding the vision and supporting other sisters with the vision of educating not only our youth but eachother of the importance of tracking our cycles with the moon &amp; holding womens cirlces to rekindle the firey feminine. While this awareness is spreading, I will continue to empower my brothers to come together in councel as well.</span></span></span></p>
<p>Holding visions of educating, Inspiriing, and Empowering my community. I am confident that the growth and evolution we experience in our personal lives, ripples out into the collective affecting individuals around the globe. We are one! </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Funding Love Offering</h3>
<p>The funding needed to take the course is $1,550. These funds cover the course itself of which is $750, Roundtrip flight Maui-Kauai $300, and final $500 will support basic living expenses for food and living for the month.</p>
<p>Your financial and energetic love offering is so deeply appreciated. Simply to know that we can support eachother when choosing to take a leap of faith. We serve as a safety net for one another, creating a space to hold and nurture with encouragement. Extending my Blessings and Gratitude :) Mahalo</p>

<p> </p></div>","Doula in Training
Aloha my name is Asheeliyah, many of you know me as Shelly. I was born and raised in Moab Utah, my beautiful desert homeland. I am currently setting roots in Maui Hawaii actively participating in and organizing various conscious community gatherings, festivals, and events.  As I align with my highest calling as a healer, I find myself in a very rested, heart resonate space eager to share my natural gifts through bodywork, inspiring song, dance, play and education.  
I'm feeling called to dive deeply into learning and gaining first hand experiences with these sacred birthing practices in honour of the Divine Feminine and the rebalancing of the masculine and feminine energies. A doula works along side with physicians, midwives, nurses and with whomever is chosen to be part of a womans birthing team. Doulas can also help by providing information and support in the pre-natal and postpartum periods. There is growing evidence that labor support is the missing component in maternal and child health care. I'm choosing to maintain these ancient practices of holding ceremony for childbirth, providing our children with a proper welcoming into the world.
The training I am raising money for is through Barabara Essman's Sacred Birthing School. June 10th-July15th 2013.  
http://www.sacredbirthing.com/vision-and-mission/
""Sacred Birthing realigns birth with the Intelligence of Natural Law. By birthing softly, babies remain conscious, and remember that they are beings of love, never losing their conscious connection to their higher nature. Each newborn radiating this coherence transforms its family, community, nation and world.
The program consists of completing a 13 week course of study under an experienced doula and receiving supervision while completing the requirements for certification. Once certified as a doula, I will have opportunities to make home visits and assist with gathering a community of support around a sister and her partner preparing to give birth birth.
I've also been holding the vision and supporting other sisters with the vision of educating not only our youth but eachother of the importance of tracking our cycles with the moon & holding womens cirlces to rekindle the firey feminine. While this awareness is spreading, I will continue to empower my brothers to come together in councel as well.
Holding visions of educating, Inspiriing, and Empowering my community. I am confident that the growth and evolution we experience in our personal lives, ripples out into the collective affecting individuals around the globe. We are one! 


Funding Love Offering
The funding needed to take the course is $1,550. These funds cover the course itself of which is $750, Roundtrip flight Maui-Kauai $300, and final $500 will support basic living expenses for food and living for the month.
Your financial and energetic love offering is so deeply appreciated. Simply to know that we can support eachother when choosing to take a leap of faith. We serve as a safety net for one another, creating a space to hold and nurture with encouragement. Extending my Blessings and Gratitude :) Mahalo

<p><strong>I am a regular guy in his mid 30’s living in New York City and loving life</strong>.  I have a BS in Finance from Northeastern University and I’m on my 12<sup>th</sup> year in the world of financial services.  I live in New York City; undeniably my soul's home.  I hail from the metropolitan Boston area and I’m the eldest of four.  I’m also fortunate enough to be able to travel frequently, having already visited 38 countries!  As of late I’ve been trying to mix tourism with volunteering; voluntourism if you will.  After my first volunteer trip I knew a sleeping giant was awakened.  Never did I imagine it would impact me as deeply as it has.  Apparently life can take you places you never imagined.  For example, Naserian School and Orphanage in Arusha, Tanzania.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What do I want to do?</strong></p>
<p> After spending only one week living and working at Naserian, I was overwhelmed with amazing, joyous, discoursing and conflicting emotions.  Reconciling all of them was an exhausting exercise.  In short, I was so impacted by the beauty, and need, of all these lovely and amazing children who were so desperate to learn and be heard.  I knew I couldn’t live with myself if I didn’t help.  So, I am<strong>.  I want to raise money for the students and orphans at Naserian School and Orphanage</strong>.  I want to make a difference, and I personally feel there is no better way than to give directly to an organization like this; providing basic services to orphans and education, the key to all success, to Tanzania’s most needy children.  </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What will your money provide?</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong><em><strong>Everything!  </strong></em></p>
<p><strong> </strong><em>Well, not EVERYTHING!  Here are some examples:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>·         Materials for building dormitories and more classrooms</li>
<li>·         Beds for children</li>
<li>·         Clothing</li>
<li>·         Books</li>
<li>·         School supplies</li>
<li>·         Salaries for hard-working teachers</li>
<li>·         Food</li>
<li>·         Mosquito nets to prevent malaria</li>
<li>·         Medicine</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How much do items cost?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Beds - $150 each.  Currently, this is the biggest need</li>
<li>Labor - $15 pays one worker for a 12 hour day!</li>
<li>Electricity for the year - Approximately $400</li>
<li>Teacher salary for one month - Approximately $100</li>
<li>Food for all orphans for one month - Approximately $100</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>EVERY LITTLE BIT HELPS!  A donation of $10 goes a long way!!!! 100% of your money will go DIRECTLY to the above items and more. </strong> The only overhead is the fees for this site and Western Union; the way in which money will be transferred.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why am I doing this?</strong></p>
<p> Because I know it’s possible that a little sacrifice on my (our) end will have an exponential impact on the other end<strong>.  But most importantly because the children at Naserian School and Orphanage, and its founder Mary Sinantei, are some of the most beautiful and caring people I’ve ever encountered. </strong> Children that have nothing, including family, couldn’t be more loving and engaged.   Mary left a well-paying job to start this project with her own funds.  She has dedicated her life to educating high-need children and providing shelter to the ones who need it.  Naserian’s survival is dependent on donations from the community and nothing more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How do I know YOUR money is being used properly?</strong></p>
<p>When I was there, my friend Jerry and I donated some money to help complete one of the dorms so the children who lived there no longer slept on the classroom floor<strong>.  Within</strong> <strong>one day of putting our money in their hands, a foreman came, ordered supplies, and supplies started arriving that day.  </strong>By the time we’d left all of the necessary supplies were purchased, all of our money was used, and workers came to work 12 hour days to complete their job.  Within weeks, some of the children were able to sleep in a proper dorm.  They’re still on the floor – so part of this initiative is to build them beds.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What will I do for you?</strong></p>
<p> As the lead of this initiative, <strong>I promise to send updates to all that have donated on exactly what your money was used for.</strong>  I’ll provide pictures when possible and share E-mails of the joy your kindness has brought to both Mary and the children.  Fortunately, Mary has access to E-mail on days she goes into town and regularly communicates with me.</p>

>>>>WHERE IS IT ? 
See School site on google maps: http://goo.gl/maps/oUKko 

Waaree village, Midegha district, OROMIA STATE.

                          EWB AND WAAREE COMMUNITY                   ARE UPGRADING THE PRIMERY SCHOOL!

What do we need the money for?


Materials that need to be purchased: cement, gravel, sand, plaster and paint... Even water needs to be purchased and transported to the remote village. 

We plan on installing windows and doors, and to buy tables and chairs, because sitting on stones is a pain in the ass ;)

We intend to install an additional rain water harvesting system, and a solar lightning system. Its all elementary.

The community requested MORE CLASSROOMS and an additional school building. Will we get enough funds to build an additional building?

All costs are significantly reduced because we don't pay for labor - We are all volunteers!


                                                           >><<

Help us build a school, and get our super authentic perks!!!
The children of the school can help you decide you want to fund our project - how?                            HAND MADE PERKS of course!
                                        For example
FOR THE BOYS 

  FOR THE GIRLS

                                TO IMPROVE EDUCATION CONDITIONS 


                                     See the condition of the school at:                                 http://youtu.be/K7AxlmMtDQw 

 

We believe that any child who arrives to school should enjoy the proper learning conditions.
What kind of difference can we make?


We can improve the learning conditions of hundreds of students.


We can build the 5th-8th grade classrooms to improve the level of education.


We can make their school a source of pride


We can help the community establish their - Community center - Library- Woman evening clases- Agricultural center - Engineering and science studies at the school... 


Imagine children going to a school that provides them with tools to invent, to create, to reserve their enviroment and to enlage the capacity of their land and sociaty. We can see it happening. Can you?



     
 THE GENERAL IDEA:
>>>Education is a key factor in community and individual development<<<
>>> Empower the rural population of Waaree Village by empowering the local school.<<<
         
 
                                                   A little about us:
EWB is an international organization, active in 50 countries around the globe. We promote empowering of developed communities through an holistic approach, and sustainable low-tech engineering solutions.
The organization is based on autonomist chapters, and each chapter is in charge of its own projects, and needs to find a funding source for its activities.
Our chapter, at Rehovot, Israel, is composed of students, engineers, and other volunteers.
 
New era has arrived:      students full of passion, engineers and                  volunteers from different fields gathered                   together to form an EWB team in order to                            to finish the construction the school.
 
FOR TRUE SOUL FARMERS 

AND MORE.... OROMO CULTURE ITEMS:

 

                                     

       
 



 
And that’s all there's to it.

Mi sono laureato in Antropologia a Londra nel 2013 e sto organizzando un rientro a casa in grande stile per promuovere e raccogliere fondi per il progetto Kilifi Social Enterprise con cui ho collaborato in Kenya nell'agosto 2012 e Gennaio 2013.

Social Enterprise è un tipo di impresa che opera con una precisa ""missione sociale"", in questo caso l'educazione:
L'educazione nei paesi in via di sviluppo è spesso l'unica via d'uscita dalla povertà estrema e un potentissimo motore di sviluppo personale. Nelle parole di Mandela:

""È grazie all'educazione che la figlia di un contadino può diventare medico, il figlio di un minatore il capo miniera o un bambino nato in una famiglia povera il presidente di una grande nazione.""

Contribuendo al progetto potrai rendere il sogno di tanti bambini una concreta realtà. 

Tu puoi scegliere dove destinare la tua donazione!

-L'avvio di una piccola impresa di olio di cocco extravergine dove il 40% dei profitti andranno a sostenere l'educazione nella provincia di Kilifi, Kenya. [Modello Sostenibile di Social Enterprise, Impatto a lungo termine]

-L'acquisto di materiale scolastico per le scuole elementari e medie della provincia di Kilifi. [Impatto diretto]

 Cosa serve e come puoi aiutare:

Risolvere i problemi del mondo è complicato, bisogna pensare in grande ma agire nel piccolo.  Il mio obiettivo è di raggiungere 1.200Euro, simbolicamente un Euro per ogni Chilometro percorso.

A lato potrai scegliere TU quanto donare e come i tuoi soldi verranno usati. Puoi scegliere se acquistare direttamente un libro per uno studente o se sponsorizzare il progetto a lungo termine di 'social enterprise'.


  L'impatto
Donare a un organizzazione di beneficenza può cambiare molte vite, ma a volte non si ha pieno controllo sulla donazione e i soldi vengono usati per pagare costose campagne pubblicitarie o si perdono nella burocrazia. 
Sponsorizzare un piccolo progetto come questo ha diversi vantaggi.
-La tua donazione verrà usata direttamente da me per l'acquisto di libri in Kenya o per sostenere le iniziative di economia sostenibile di Kilifi Social Enterprise.
-Il progetto è mirato verso i figli del ceto sociale più povero: contadini e braccianti che producono e raccolgono cocco e derivati.
-Volete sapere se la vostra donazione è andata a buon fine? Sapete a chi chiedere!
-Durante la ricerca per la mia tesi, a Gennaio 2013, abbiamo creato rapporti di fiducia reciproca con 50 famiglie la cui unica fonte di guadagno deriva dalle piantagioni di cocco. Queste persone, il cui reddito giornaliero è inferiore a 1 Euro, saranno i primi beneficiari dei nostri servizi e delle vostre donazioni. 



Successi passati

Con l'aiuto dei lettori del mio blog abbiamo ristrutturato la casa di una famiglia che mi ha ospitato, donato libri alla Mkombe Accademy e messo le fondamenta per una nuova abitazione in mattoni.

Dopo


30 Libri per la scuola di Mkombe




Fondamenta



Rischi, Difficoltà e come affrontarli:
Fare Business in Africa può risultare complicato per via dell'economia a stampo informale e lunghe pratiche burocratiche. Per queste ragioni il continente non è mai riuscito ad attrarre investimenti esteri sufficienti a creare un economia stabile. 
Kilifi Social Enterprise vuole trasformare questi ostacoli in opportunità e testare un modello economico più flessibile e adatto al contesto. 
La mia esperienza di ricerca antropologica in Kenya si è rivelata indispensabile per concepire il progetto così come il rapporto di fiducia con il mio collaboratore Keniota, Thomas, e la sua conoscenza della legislatura locale.


  Se non puoi fare una donazione puoi comunque aiutare!

Condividi la campagna con i tuoi amici, e chiedi a loro di fare lo stesso!

<p>Uplift is a 501(c)3 nonprofit dedicated to combatting online sexual violence through education and advocacy. We work to ensure that these flourishing communities are safe for the millions of people who connect through them. We believe that the internet can be an incredible tool for good; that everyone has the right to feel free from sexual harassment; and that everyone should have the freedom to use the Internet safely.</p>
<h4>Since we started as a task force, Uplift has worked tirelessly to support the communities that are so dear to us. </h4>
<ul>
<li><p>We created the<a href=""http://uplifttogether.tumblr.com/pledge"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> </a><a href=""http://uplifttogether.tumblr.com/pledge"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> Safer Community Pledge</a>, designed to give people simple and concrete actions to support survivors and respect the boundaries of others. Since September 2014, this pledge was shared over 9,000 times, was discussed in videos gaining over 97,000 views, and was signed in-person at conventions by over 1,000 people. </p></li>
<li><p>We created an educational Youtube series called <a href=""http://youtube.com/uplifttogether"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Engage by Uplift</a><a href=""http://youtube.com/uplifttogether"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>, which has been viewed almost 70,000 times. The series has over twenty videos covering everything from consent to trolling.</p></li>
<li><p>We had strong presences at<a href=""http://geekycon.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Geekycon</a> and<a href=""http://vidcon.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Vidcon</a> this past summer, distributing resources, leading panels and workshops, and hosting a roundtable to get direct feedback from the community on how we should address sexual violence online.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The internet is a huge part of our culture, and the size, number, and importance of online networks only continues to grow. It is crucial that these spaces are given proper attention within the sexual violence prevention field. Uplift is creating a framework for addressing online sexual violence that empowers both online communities and sexual violence organizations.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461735008/Praise_for_Uplift_kerg2l.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p></p>
<p>Uplift’s ultimate goal is to educate on- and off-line communities about online sexual violence, advocate for survivors, and foster safer online spaces for all. We've come a long way from the tiny task force we were back in March 2014, and with your help we will go so much further. </p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>We will establish a chapters program to take our mission to a local level.</b> While in-person chapters may seem odd given the topic of our work, they serve the purpose of allowing young people who make connections online to translate their support systems into physical spaces. Chapters will also be able to advocate in their local, physical communities -- increasing visibility for the issue, supporting survivors, and encouraging bystander intervention.</p></li>
<li><p><b>We will increase our presence at conventions by providing more resources for con-goers.</b> Since conventions are spaces in which online acquaintances and friends physically meet, a presence in these spaces is essential. Our past experiences at fan Vidcon and Geekycon have made it clear that having a booth -- a physical, safe space to go when encountering a coercive or uncomfortable situation -- is vital for attendees to feel safe. Many reports of harassment and abuse at conventions have been made directly to us. This year, we hope to be able to attend more conventions, provide more written resources, and lead more programming. These programs will include everything from how to create a safe space to safe online leadership and how to translate online communities to IRL spaces. It’s only through education that we can ensure long-term, grassroots, sustainable change.</p></li>
<li><p><b>We will train convention staff and volunteers in bystander intervention strategies to prevent, recognize, and defuse coercive situations.</b> Since the staff members leading these conventions are usually community members as well, staff training not only ensures that convention staff are able to intervene and prevent situations at their events; it also increases awareness of the issue among community members who can take those skills and implement them in their day-to-day lives.</p></li>
<li><p><b>We will partner with platforms to institute change from a structural level.</b> We hope to work directly with platforms like YouTube, Vine, Twitter, and Tumblr to ensure that their structure is elevating a community, rather than giving unlimited power to a few individuals.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Our plans are ambitious; we’re the first to recognize that. In order to give each of these projects the attention it deserves, Uplift needs to begin paying its senior staffers. </p>A portion of the funds would be allocated for travel, stipends for senior staff, and stipends for key volunteers to give us the presence at conventions and organizations we need to accomplish our goals. The funds would also give us the ability to have dedicated graphic artists, coordinators, and web developers to create high quality products that can be updated over time - giving us the foundation we need to grow as a nonprofit and continue to achieve our goals. These three steps would come together to create a coordinated prevention strategy that would enable us to bolster our mission and ensure that online communities are safe for all. </div> <div> <h3></h3>

Since September 2014, this pledge was shared over 9,000 times, was discussed in videos gaining over 97,000 views, and was signed in-person at conventions by over 1,000 people. 
We created an educational Youtube series called Engage by Uplift, which has been viewed almost 70,000 times. The series has over twenty videos covering everything from consent to trolling.
We had strong presences at Geekycon and Vidcon this past summer, distributing resources, leading panels and workshops, and hosting a roundtable to get direct feedback from the community on how we should address sexual violence online.

The internet is a huge part of our culture, and the size, number, and importance of online networks only continues to grow. It is crucial that these spaces are given proper attention within the sexual violence prevention field. Uplift is creating a framework for addressing online sexual violence that empowers both online communities and sexual violence organizations.


   


Uplift’s ultimate goal is to educate on- and off-line communities about online sexual violence, advocate for survivors, and foster safer online spaces for all. We've come a long way from the tiny task force we were back in March 2014, and with your help we will go so much further. 

We will establish a chapters program to take our mission to a local level. While in-person chapters may seem odd given the topic of our work, they serve the purpose of allowing young people who make connections online to translate their support systems into physical spaces. Chapters will also be able to advocate in their local, physical communities -- increasing visibility for the issue, supporting survivors, and encouraging bystander intervention.
We will increase our presence at conventions by providing more resources for con-goers. Since conventions are spaces in which online acquaintances and friends physically meet, a presence in these spaces is essential. Our past experiences at fan Vidcon and Geekycon have made it clear that having a booth -- a physical, safe space to go when encountering a coercive or uncomfortable situation -- is vital for attendees to feel safe. Many reports of harassment and abuse at conventions have been made directly to us. This year, we hope to be able to attend more conventions, provide more written resources, and lead more programming. These programs will include everything from how to create a safe space to safe online leadership and how to translate online communities to IRL spaces. It’s only through education that we can ensure long-term, grassroots, sustainable change.
We will train convention staff and volunteers in bystander intervention strategies to prevent, recognize, and defuse coercive situations. Since the staff members leading these conventions are usually community members as well, staff training not only ensures that convention staff are able to intervene and prevent situations at their events; it also increases awareness of the issue among community members who can take those skills and implement them in their day-to-day lives.
We will partner with platforms to institute change from a structural level. We hope to work directly with platforms like YouTube, Vine, Twitter, and Tumblr to ensure that their structure is elevating a community, rather than giving unlimited power to a few individuals.

Our plans are ambitious; we’re the first to recognize that. In order to give each of these projects the attention it deserves, Uplift needs to begin paying its senior staffers. A portion of the funds would be allocated for travel, stipends for senior staff, and stipends for key volunteers to give us the presence at conventions and organizations we need to accomplish our goals. The funds would also give us the ability to have dedicated graphic artists, coordinators, and web developers to create high quality products that can be updated over time - giving us the foundation we need to grow as a nonprofit and continue to achieve our goals. These three steps would come together to create a coordinated prevention strategy that would enable us to bolster our mission and ensure that online communities are safe for all.   


10% of the budget will go towards printing and supplies
26% of the budget will go towards travel for conventions
32% of the budget will go to direct programming and outreach
33% of the budget will go to funding staff members




 













  SENIOR STAFF: Grace Miller (Operations Director), Jennifer Dorsey (Communications Director), Sahitya Raja (Co-Executive Director), Katie Twyman (Co-Executive Director)Each of our staff members and volunteers has a strong background in the online communities that we serve. Online communities are our homes, and we’re intensely dedicated to them. Many of our staff also have a background in sexual violence prevention. Our intimate understanding of both online communities and sexual violence prevention makes us uniquely capable of creating resources and programs serving our mission.

<h3>What is Project: Welcome Wagon?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>We're excited to tell you about something that we just started this week—and although we’re biased…it is very, very cool.
</p>
<p>We’re giving, “Welcome Baskets,” to parents and family that have had the blessing (although they might not know it yet) of having a child—or receiving a diagnosis before birth—of Down Syndrome. We’ll also be ready to give the family help, guidance, and encouragement during this extremely difficult time. We’ll do that if the family wishes—but if they don’t, we’ll honor their wishes, too. They’ll just get the basket.</p>
<p>Many of you know that Laura and I have a beautiful, perfect, soon to be 4 YEARS OLD boy, that just happens to have Down Syndrome. Well, maybe you do know this—or maybe you don’t—but the days after he was born, the uncertainty, the grief, and sadness over his diagnosis were some of the darkest moments of our life. Honestly, if you know Alec and our life now, you know that they needn’t have been…but they were. It was so tough to handle and cope with those emotions. Just thinking about them now, several years and thousands of happy memories removed from them—I still get choked up and very emotional. I’m thinking it’s a feeling that only people that have been in a similar situation understand.
</p>
<p>…And that’s who we’re trying to help. Project Welcome Wagon is the brainchild of Ashley Gradel Bailey, who has a perfect little man named Anthony--who also has an extra chromosome. She approached me about making this a reality, and we’re going to do it!</p>
<p>We’re still prototyping and brainstorming the basket, but we’re going to have some baby clothes—to include a Down Syndrome “Am I Rocking This Extra Chromosome or What?!” onesie, diapers, the book “Babies With Down Syndrome: A New Parents’ Guide,” a list of resources and things we wish we would’ve known, and maybe most importantly…letters from us (and eventually our kiddos with DS) welcoming them to the “club,” and offering our support. </p>
<p>The idea is that doctors at our local hospitals will put out the “Bat Signal,” for us when they have a precious baby with DS that arrives on the scene. We’ll be ready to visit, if allowed, and give the basket, and even let them see our little guys, and how freaking sweet and cute they are! You see, the doctors don’t always give a real accurate idea of how wonderful life can be with these Angels on Earth. It’s a time of sorrow when it CAN be a more joyous occasion. Wow, we just wish we knew THEN what we know NOW!</p>
<p>That’s what we we’re doing with this. 
</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>
<p>IF you feel so inclined, give a little bit to make this a reality. Even a cool $10 will help. We’re aiming for a budget of about $100 per basket, and EVERY CENT of that will go to these new families. Our $500 request will see to it that at least five families get a visit from the Welcome Wagon and a basket.</p>
<p>If you don’t do that, we’ll still love you—but we certainly appreciate and are humbled by the help we do receive.</p>
<p>As far as what's in it for you...well, honestly, it's a good feeling of helping these families through a difficult time if the baby is born without them knowing about the diagnosis.</p>
<p>BUT--here's one of the biggest things we're trying to do: We're going to talk to families that get a prenatal diagnosis of Down Syndrome, and let them know how wonderful life can be with these beautiful children. Right now, upwards of 90% of these precious souls are killed in the womb after a DS diagnosis. We think a lot of this is due to bad and outdated information they get from otherwise well-meaning doctors. We're going to counter that and let them know how life REALLY is with these blessings.</p>
<p>We think that the $100 (or so) basket and visit from us can go a long way towards saving lives.</p>

<p>If met, our IGG goal will help us close the books on One of A Kind, Like Me, and reprint Oh, Oh, Baby Boy. With $30K-$50K more, we can finish developing our next two books, <i>The Blue Flute</i> and <i>Best Day Ever</i>, get them designed, translated, and printed.</p>
<p>When readers hold a book in their hands, they don’t often think about the many people and processes that went into making it. In general, publishers schedule out books in 2 year timeframes. In other words, once a publisher decides to move forward on a book, we typically aim for a release date two years out. This allows for continued manuscript development, vetting, planning, illustration, review phases, design, printing, shipping of the book, etc. - You get the idea!</p>
<p>This is why our upcoming books have different release dates - each is in a different stage of development.</p>
<p>And, with all these steps in the process, a hiccup or delay here or there can affect release dates.</p>

Best Day Ever [working title] Written by Lora Collier ChanRelease: Fall/Winter 2017 Synopsis: Textile patterns unlock the imaginations of 12 diverse children as they take different journeys to the local park. This book shares the value of community with even the youngest readers.
Oh, Oh, Baby Boy! Written & illustrated by Janine MacbethReleased: June 2013 (We've sold out and are fundraising to print more copies!)Synopsis: Readers welcome a baby boy who’s nurtured and cared for by his loving father. We watch as he grows up to become a father himself. This book celebrates dads of color and non-traditional masculinity, and promotes gender equity within families.






(Above) Beautiful Stories Giclée Print, Book Bag, & Greeting Card Art

If met, our IGG goal will help us close the books on One of A Kind, Like Me, and reprint Oh, Oh, Baby Boy. With $30K-$50K more, we can finish developing our next two books, The Blue Flute and Best Day Ever, get them designed, translated, and printed.
When readers hold a book in their hands, they don’t often think about the many people and processes that went into making it. In general, publishers schedule out books in 2 year timeframes. In other words, once a publisher decides to move forward on a book, we typically aim for a release date two years out. This allows for continued manuscript development, vetting, planning, illustration, review phases, design, printing, shipping of the book, etc. - You get the idea!
This is why our upcoming books have different release dates - each is in a different stage of development.
And, with all these steps in the process, a hiccup or delay here or there can affect release dates.

<h3><strong>Chi siamo?</strong></h3>
<p>L’Orchestra Fuoritempo è un'associazione di promozione sociale interamente gestita da volontari, nata nel 2009 allo scopo di raggruppare i ragazzi della comunità trentina presso l’oratorio di Martignano per organizzare per loro un’attività durante l’estate. Oggi raggruppa circa 70 giovani musicisti tra i 12 e i 20 anni intorno a un progetto di formazione musicale, di crescita artistico-culturale e di promozione della loro partecipazione attiva alla vita della comunità.</p>
<p>Ogni anno l’Orchestra Fuoritempo è protagonista di molti progetti musicali, che si traducono in concerti musicali in Trentino, in Italia e all’estero, tutti caratterizzati da una forte valenza culturale-formativa sia per i ragazzi coinvolti, sia per la comunità destinataria dei concerti realizzati.​ Al Presidente dell'Associazione ed al Direttore dell'orchestra, che dal 2009 si occupano della realizzazione delle attività dei ragazzi, negli ultimi anni si sono affiancati altri volontari, principalmente di alcune famiglie dei musicisti. Alcuni di loro si occupano delle attività più divulgative delle attività dell'Orchestra (dal progetto grafico di alcuni materiali, alla pubblicità dei concerti). Altri offrono supporto logistico e affiancano i ragazzi durante lo svolgimento vero e proprio dei concerti.</p>
<p>L'Associazione “Tribù nel mondo” è un’associazione nata per sostenere i bimbi orfani ospiti dell'orfanotrofio Casa Marisa di Kinshasa (Congo). Tribù del mondo nasce dal desiderio di quattro famiglie adottive di mantenere e coltivare un rapporto con il Paese che ha dato i natali ai loro figli. L'Associazione Tribù del Mondo è costituita dalle famiglie dei ragazzi adottati, che quindi sono in grado di raccontare in prima persona le storie dei ragazzi che sono stati adottati.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Che progetto proponiamo?</strong></h3>
<p>Il progetto Tribù nel mondo” nasce da una semplice chiacchierata tra i membri delle due diverse associazioni.</p>
<p>Tribù del Mondo ha bisogno di raccogliere circa 7.000,00 € al mese da inviare in Congo, per “far vivere” o meglio “far sopravvivere” più di 100 bambini ospitati in tale struttura. L’idea che abbiamo avuto è di organizzare un Tour per le città d’Italia dove vivono gli “ex angeli di Kinshasa” cioè i bambini prima ospitati nell’orfanotrofio ed adesso adottati dalle famiglie italiane.</p>
<p>Il progetto si propone di creare uno spettacolo musicale accompagnato da narrazioni e interventi multimediali sul tema del progetto. L’orchestra FuoriTempo realizzerà lo spettacolo musicale con pezzi di diverse nazionalità mentre Tribù del Mondo penserà ai brani da leggere tutti tratti dal libro Furaha (una storia di adozione di una bambina congolese), alle immagini dei bambini ospitati a Casa Marisa, alle riflessioni sul tema dell’adozione, dell’accoglienza e della solidarietà.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Perché chiediamo dei soldi per il crowdfunding?</strong></h3>
<p>Per la prima parte del progetto, quella di organizzazione e creazione dei contenuti dello spettacolo, siamo riusciti ad avere qualche aiuto economico, ma per la seconda parte in cui vogliamo diffondere il nostro messaggio fuori dal  Trentino abbiamo bisogno anche del vostro aiuto … del vostro supporto economico … perché far viaggiare e sfamare una carovana di circa 50 ragazzi + gli organizzatori, pagare le varie autorizzazioni per i permessi ad esibirsi in pubblico, diritti d’autore per i pezzi suonati, ecc… non è cosa da poco!!! Ogni partecipante al tour pagherà una quota d’iscrizione simbolica, anche se servirà a coprire ben poco delle spese da sostenere.</p>
<p>Vi chiediamo quindi un’offerta per poter coprire le spese collegate al viaggio dei ragazzi nelle varie città; la nostra filosofia è “più siamo meglio è”, tante piccole offerte per coprire la grande spesa e per poi riuscire a donare il più possibile ai bambini di Casa Marisa.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Qual è il nostro obiettivo?</strong></h3>
<p>Il nostro obiettivo è raggiungere 13.000 euro in 60 giorni (2 mesi). Questi fondi ci serviranno per coprire le spese vive del viaggio dei musicisti nelle città, in modo che possano suonare e diffondere il nostro messaggio, ma serviranno anche per ristampare il libro Fuhara, che racconta un’esperienza di adozione.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Perché parlate di “progetto”? Non è soltanto musica?</strong></h3>
<p>No, non è soltanto musica. Il nostro scopo è unire la passione per la musica con la passione per la solidarietà. Inventare uno spettacolo dove le note musicali si mescolano con le parole, dove i suoni si alternano alle immagini, dove le emozioni che irrompono nei cuori scuotano i pensieri che riempiono le menti.</p>
<p>L'intero progetto è basato sulla condivisione di un obiettivo comune, sul racconto delle diverse esperienze vissute, sul racconto e la divulgazione di un tema importante come quello dell'accoglienza e dell'accettazione della diversità utilizzando diversi linguaggi allo stesso tempo (quello musicale, quello visivo e quello letterario).</p>
<p>Pensiamo che il valore aggiunto di questa condivisione e contaminazione dei diversi linguaggi che caratterizzano le diverse età degli attori principali sia rappresentato dall'essere un messaggio che, venendo dai ragazzi, sarà diretto e facilmente accessibile a un pubblico di tutte le età, perché sarà filtrato attraverso il punto di vista dei pari.</p>

location, the fields will be investigated for Foodwaste. Through local contacts
and collaborations with shops and farmers, veggies and fruits will be saved
from the bin and ingredients collected for a healthy meal. The guerilla duo
will meet refugees thanks to NGO’s on location. With the magic construction
build by handyman friends in Amsterdam, the van will have all the needs for a
cooking session. The kitchen will be set up around camps or in public places. The

<p>Armadas con una cámara y cacharros de cocina,
dos chicas comenzarán una lucha pacífica contra el desperdicio de comida; y al
mismo tiempo contra las fronteras. </p>
<p><i>Bellies
Beyond borders ( Barrigas sin fronteras)</i> es una cocina
creativa de comida reciclada sobre ruedas para dar la bienvenida a los
refugiados en Europa.</p>
<p>Kilos de zanahorias con mal aspecto, pan del día
anterior y otros alimentos abandonados son rescatados de los contenedores por
Guerilla Kitchen </p>
<p>Amsterdam. En colaboración con comercios locales
y supermercados, los activistas recogen los excedentes de comida para luego
compartirlos con la comunidad más necesitada. Compartiendo con amigos y desconocidos una
cocina creativa basada en el aprovechamiento de los alimentos y una práctica de
muy satisfactoria de mercado alimentario gratuito.</p>
<p>Esta es una historia que debe continuar por
eso dos chicas dejaran la sede de Guerilla Kitchen Amsterdam para continuar la
misión de una manera global.<span>  ¡<i>Llena barrigas y no contenedores  más allá de las fronteras !</i></span></p>
<p></p>
<p>Este proyecto nace al ver como en Europa
llenamos los contenedores de comida aprovechable mientras que en el resto del
mundo miles de personas sufren para conseguir un planto de comida. Parece
imposible, pero esto ocurre al mismo tiempo que una guerra estalla en un país y
el resto de países cierran sus carreteras con fronteras para no atender al

will go for a peaceful fight against foodwaste and borders. Bellies beyond
borders is a creative foodwaste kitchen-on-wheels to welcome refugees in Europe! 
Kilos of ugly carrots, one-day-old bread and other abandoned food are rescued
from the container by Guerilla Kitchen Amsterdam over the last months. In
partnerships with local stores and supermarkets, surplus products are collected
to share with the community. Big cooking sessions and free supermarkets fed
hundreds of friends and strangers. 
This is a story to be continued.. Two
girls will leave the headquarters of Guerilla Kitchen Amsterdam to continue the
mission on a global scale: Fill bellies not bins – beyond borders!
 
Whilst people in other parts of the planet struggle to fill their
bellies, the West fills up bins with foodwaste. Whilst refugees run
away from unsave situations, European governments block their route with walls
to protect the Western comfort. The world upside down!

Time to reverse this system and create a
scenario of sharing and caring. The female guerilla fighters will share their
pots and pans their recepies, and creativity with refugees all over Europe. 



In collaboration with the refugees, the guerilla
girls will produce short videos. They will be broadcasted online at Bellies Beyond
Borders TV. Watch a cookingshow with a Syrian lady or a musicvideo for a
Ghanese teenage rapper about his hometown. 
The camera and cookingtools are packed! All they
need now is a van! 
Enjoy a delicious healthy meal by Guerilla
Kitchen Amsterdam this month and make their mission happen! Every euro brings
them 1 kilometer closer! Order a breakkie-in-bed, or eternal glory with your
name tag on the van. Indulge a lunch-for-love: a healthy meal for you and
co-workers cooked with rescued veggies, or a meal at the weekly Foodwaste Feast! 

Thanks to your funding they will welcome
refugees on behalf of all of us :)



THE BATTLE PLAN:The
Guerilla Kitchen Van will hit the road at the end of October. On every
location, the fields will be investigated for Foodwaste. Through local contacts
and collaborations with shops and farmers, veggies and fruits will be saved
from the bin and ingredients collected for a healthy meal. The guerilla duo
will meet refugees thanks to NGO’s on location. With the magic construction
build by handyman friends in Amsterdam, the van will have all the needs for a
cooking session. The kitchen will be set up around camps or in public places. The
camera won’t always be there. First part of the mission is to create a safe and
comfortable space and cook a nutricious no-waste meal :)

Armadas con una cámara y cacharros de cocina,
dos chicas comenzarán una lucha pacífica contra el desperdicio de comida; y al
mismo tiempo contra las fronteras. 
Bellies
Beyond borders ( Barrigas sin fronteras) es una cocina
creativa de comida reciclada sobre ruedas para dar la bienvenida a los
refugiados en Europa.
Kilos de zanahorias con mal aspecto, pan del día
anterior y otros alimentos abandonados son rescatados de los contenedores por
Guerilla Kitchen 
Amsterdam. En colaboración con comercios locales
y supermercados, los activistas recogen los excedentes de comida para luego
compartirlos con la comunidad más necesitada. Compartiendo con amigos y desconocidos una
cocina creativa basada en el aprovechamiento de los alimentos y una práctica de
muy satisfactoria de mercado alimentario gratuito.
Esta es una historia que debe continuar por
eso dos chicas dejaran la sede de Guerilla Kitchen Amsterdam para continuar la
misión de una manera global.  ¡Llena barrigas y no contenedores  más allá de las fronteras !

Este proyecto nace al ver como en Europa
llenamos los contenedores de comida aprovechable mientras que en el resto del
mundo miles de personas sufren para conseguir un planto de comida. Parece
imposible, pero esto ocurre al mismo tiempo que una guerra estalla en un país y
el resto de países cierran sus carreteras con fronteras para no atender al
grito de solidaridad internacional que suplican miles de personas afectadas por
esta guerra.
¡ El mundo la reves!
Es momento para invertir el sistema y crear un
escenario donde compartir y ayudar al prójimo sea una ley universal. 
Estas guerrilleras de la cacerola compartiran
sartenes, recetas y creatividad culinaria con los refuiados de toda Europa.
En colaboracion con todos los refugiados, las
participantes de Guerilla Kitchen produciran videos cortos  que serán retrasmitidos online en Bellies Beyond Borders TV.  En este canal podreís ver desde una madre
siria presentando su programa de cocina hasta a un rapero sirio cantando sobre

<h3>Our Transition</h3>In line with our mission of empowerment, this year Haute Africa will transition control of our organization to our current Program Manager, Ansoumane Camara.  Ansoumane is well prepared to tackle this challenge, as he served as a contract consultant for Haute Africa from 2006-2010 and was
then named Program Manager in 2010.  After this final fundraising campaign, Haute Africa will <b>suspend US fundraising operations indefinitely</b> and rely on Ansoumane to locate funding for Haute Africa operations moving forward.  The relationships Ansoumane has built with key government agencies and nonprofit foundations should serve him well in this capacity.  <br/><br/>Yet the current Ebola outbreak stands to ruin our transition plan and our very organization...<br/><p></p>
<h3>Ebola Crisis</h3>In March 2014, an Ebola outbreak started in the Forest Region of Guinea, near the town of N'Zerekore (which happens to be home to 40 of Haute Africa's clients).  Since March, there have been more than 21,000 reported cases of Ebola worldwide, and over 8,300 reported resulting deaths.  About 1,800 of these deaths have occurred in Guinea.  <br/><br/>In addition to the tragic toll in terms of human life, Ebola has brought Guinea and the surrounding region to a complete standstill in terms of business and economic development.  Large corporations and nonprofit foundations alike have suspended operations and pulled out their people.  Funding for anything other than Ebola (including education, infrastructure, agriculture, etc.) has all but dried up.  This has made Haute Africa's transition an especially difficult one, as the very government agencies and nonprofit foundations that Haute Africa will depend on moving forward have suspended their relevant funding.<br/>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>In order to be fair to Ansoumane and his family (including his wife Madina and daughter Fatoumata shown in the picture above) during our transition, we are raising funds for a ""transition package"" for Ansoumane to weather the Ebola outbreak and fund Haute Africa's operations from now until July 2015.  This amount comes to $4,100.  This campaign will also cover remaining fees and debts of $1,650, which will allow Haute Africa to close out US fundraising operations.<br/>

All about Source ConnectionSince 2001 the Source Connection Foundation supports local communities in rural Zambia. We're fighting poverty by transferring knowledge. We have empowered the people in Simonga by the development of a 'Community-based Sustainable Tourism' project, we started drinking water projects in Mandia and Katombora and we developed a minor agriculture project in both areas. Since 2012 we advanced our efforts to support agriculture in the region by the provision of skills and knowledge through our local partner Farming God´s Way. On behalf of and together with local communities we work to improve agriculture skills, gain food security and economic development by access to the (local) food market for a better future with lasting results.

So why should you support this initiative?

In order to answer that we would like to quote from a recent article regarding Conservation Agriculture in IPS News , wherein the Chef of the World Food Program Mr. Cousin states: “we have the solution in our hands"". The article discusses the current drought and food scarcity in Zambia and proposes Conservation Agriculture as being THE solution. It explains how the method embraces minimal soil disruption and more variation in crop growing. When growing more different types of crops, a farmer is less dependent on the success of one harvest alone. Also, while disrupting the soil less, the soil is better equipped to handle heavy rainfall and thus able to prevent flooding that could destroy crops.
This recent Global News article thus builds upon what SourceConnection has been a firm believer in for years. Conservation Agriculture is THE future for farmers. Not only for Zambian farmers, but also for farmers in other African countries which are facing the same climate issues.

<h3>Chi sono io: </h3>
<p>Mi chiamo Sara Lando, e da più di 10 anni lavoro come fotografa e giro il mondo insegnando fotografia.<br/>Quando l'estate scorsa la mia pagina di Facebook è stata invasa di bufale sugli immigrati ho pensato che mi sarebbe piaciuto approfondire l'argomento e ho contattato Casa a Colori, un'associazione di Bassano del Grappa che da 25 anni lavora sul territorio fornendo supporto ai migranti e ai cittadini su tematiche che riguardano  l'integrazione, la formazione e l'intercultura. Non sono una fotogiornalista e non avrebbe avuto senso per me portare avanti un progetto documentario, ma nel corso dei mesi mi sono accorta di quanto manchi in questo momento una rappresentazione fotografica dei richiedenti asilo che li veda come individui, fotografati non come testimonianza ma in quanto soggetti, persone che non vogliono essere necessariamente mostrate per educare gli altri o come esempio dei problemi del mondo, ma che vogliono -come chiunque- una foto in cui si riconoscono e si vedono belli. </p>
<h3>Chi è Casa a Colori</h3>
<p>Casa a Colori nasce nel 1992 su iniziativa di un gruppo di volontari che operavano all’Istituto Scalabrini di Bassano del Grappa per dare un aiuto concreto ai migranti che in quegli anni iniziavano ad arrivare numerosi principalmente dal nord Africa e dai paesi dell’est.</p>
<p>Inizialmente sorta per tentare di risolvere il problema alloggiativo con la creazione di centri di prima e di seconda accoglienza, successivamente si è impegnata sul fronte della formazione e dell’intercultura realizzando corsi di alfabetizzazione e per l’inserimento lavorativo e sul fronte della tutela degli immigrati aprendo uno sportello informazioni.</p>
<p>Attualmente l’associazione opera su più fronti e non solo in favore degli immigrati, nonostante nei loro confronti sia ancora maggiormente rivolta la loro attenzione.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Cosa ci serve e Cosa ti arriva</h3>
<p>Dal 17 Marzo al 2 Aprile, per celebrare i 25 anni di Casa a Colori, allestiremo una mostra fotografica a ingresso libero. Abbiamo chiesto di poter avere un piccolo spazio per esporre qualche foto, ci hanno messo a disposizione Palazzo Bonaguro nella sua interezza. <br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487777658/uuvt3bzg1olfifrfnqaa.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I soldi raccolti serviranno a stampare una quarantina di stampe su stoffa 100x140 con i ritratti in bianco e nero, una serie di immagini a colori che illustrano le attività dell'associazione, i materiali di supporto alla mostra (inviti, cartelloni, locandine...), ad acquistare le cornici e a coprire le spese dell'inaugurazione, per evitare di chiedere alla gente di portarsi le patatine e l'aranciata amara da casa. </p>

<h3>Perché il crowdfunding</h3>
<p>La cosa più ovvia per coprire i costi di questa operazione sarebbe stata cercare una o più aziende che facessero da sponsor. Abbiamo però pensato che potesse essere più importante e significativo coinvolgere i cittadini di Bassano (e perché no, anche quelli che non vivono qui) e mostrare in modo tangibile che esistono persone che riconoscono il valore della diversità e dell'accoglienza e che non siamo circondati solo di intolleranza e rifiuto del diverso. <br/>Vogliamo dare alle persone la possibilità di partecipare a un'iniziativa in cui si possa celebrare qualcosa di bello e non soltanto intervenire per far fronte a un'emergenza. <br/>Vogliamo festeggiare e vogliamo farlo insieme a voi: voi che conoscete Casa a Colori e voi che non ne avete mai sentito parlare, ma magari avete in mente una gita a Bassano a metà marzo. Voi che siete informati sulle problematiche legate all'immigrazione e voi che vorreste saperne di più.<br/>E anche voi a cui non frega niente della mostra ma volete farvi fare un ritratto da me o mangiare una cena etnica: la nostra gratitudine non diminuisce di un millimetro. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Cosa succede se superiamo l'obiettivo?</h3>
<p>Per l'allestimento di questa mostra abbiamo cercato di ""stringere un pochino la cinghia"" e scelto  soluzioni il più possibile economiche, senza dover rinunciare completamente alla qualità: questo perché ci piacerebbe poter superare l'obiettivo e usare i fondi raccolti in questo modo per creare dei laboratori fotografici. <br/>La fotografia è uno strumento potentissimo di comunicazione e nel corso dell'ultimo decennio ho potuto vedere sul campo come una macchina fotografica sappia creare ponti e raccontare storie anche per persone che credono di non avere una voce. <br/>L'idea è quella di non creare delle iniziative esclusive per i richiedenti asilo, ma degli spazi aperti anche ai cittadini italiani, in cui si possa collaborare a progetti comuni, pensati nell'ottica di integrazione e confronto.<br/>A seconda di quanti soldi verranno raccolti saranno iniziative piccole o un po' più importanti, ma mi piacerebbe che fosse comunque l'inizio di qualcosa da fare crescere nel tempo. </p>

<h3>Come puoi aiutarci</h3>
<p>Ovviamente il modo più diretto di aiutarci è quello di dare un contributo economico, selezionando una delle reward che trovi qui a fianco. Se non ti è possibile puoi sempre aiutarci passando parola il più possibile: condividi il link usando gli strumenti di condivisione che Indiegogo ti mette e disposizione, parlane con gli sconosciuti mentre fai la fila in posta, e vieni a festeggiare con noi il 17 marzo!  </p>

<p>Marysol is a 30 year old graphic designer from Hermosillo, Mexico. Ten years ago, she participated in a study-exchange program with the Trilateral Consortium on Capacity Building in Community Rehabilitation and Disability Studies at the University of Arizona. Inspired by her time there, Marysol applied for and received a Fulbright scholarship to pursue research based on her interest in interaction design and inclusive design in the United States at North Carolina State University.</p>
<p>In the Spring of 2013, Marysol successfully defended her thesis titled <em>Social Play and Bimanual Activities through Multiplayer Interactive Experiences for Children with Cerebral</em> <em>Palsy</em>. Informed by research in physical therapy, social psychology, and inspired by interviews with professionals working in support centers for children with disabilities, Marysol designed a prototype to help children with CP develop physical capabilities while engaging with their peers.</p>
<p><strong>Her Situation</strong></p>
<p>After successfully defending her graduate thesis in May, Marysol's work was recognized by the International Association of Societies of Design Research (<a href=""http://www.iasdr2013.jp/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">IASDR</a>) when she was accepted to present a paper at their 2013 conference in Tokyo on August 26-30. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, Marysol cannot afford to make the trip on her own. Transitioning off of her Fulbright scholarship and applying for PhD positions so she can continue her research has left Marysol without enough money to pay the expensive way to Japan.</p>
<p>In order to help Marysol present her knowledge to the most prestigious community of researchers in design, I have started this campaign for her. She has agreed to let me open her case to the world, and I hope that you will share my belief in her work. Presenting at the IASDR conference is a special opportunity to gain the feedback of experienced researchers that will help advance her mission to improve people's lives through design.</p>

<p><strong>The</strong> <strong>Breakdown</strong></p>
<p>Marysol needs help with all of her travel expenses. In August she will be relocating to Sweden to look for PhD research positions near my current residence in Sweden. Therefore, I would like to ask your help funding her:</p>
<p>- Conference fee at Student Rate (<span>$369</span>)</p>
<p>- Plane ticket from Stockholm to Tokyo ($1300)</p>
<p>- Accommodations in Tokyo (appx. <span>$</span>800)</p>
<p>In return, Marysol has several ways she will show how grateful she is for your support. During her trip she will be sending home perks based on your level of contriution. Additionally, she will be creating custom avatars based on the gameworld she created for her research. Finally, for the extremely committed, she will pick out a unique gift just for you from a shop in Japan!</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Helping Marysol present at the IASDR conference means that she will be able to share her committment to understanding and including people with disabilities as collaborators in the design process. I believe her work has the potential to improve the quality of life for people facing extreme daily challenges, and enrich the lives of others by promoting open, inclusive, and positive experiences through design — I hope you will join me in supporting Marysol on this journey.</p>

<p>Abstract:<em> The World Health Organization (WHO) defines activity as ""the execution of a task or action by an individual"" and identifies activity limitation as ""difficulties an individual may have in executing activities"". Children with unilateral spastic Cerebral Palsy (CP)–a permanent disorder that affects one side of the body, and frequently involves the hand more than the leg– have activity limitations, hindering social and motor skills. In such cases, children often have limited bimanual upper extremity use (i.e. activities that involve both hands simultaneously). Increasing bimanual activity levels for children with CP can prevent subsequent functional limitations resulting from muscle weakness. Previous studies exhibit the potential for Active Video Games (AVG) to serve as an alternative to physical therapy for people with CP. This paper explores a digital interactive system as a means for promoting social play and the mastery of bimanual activities in children between six and eight years old with CP. Achievements of both of these goals will improve their performance in daily activities and have roles that are more active in social settings. Prototypes shown feature the design of multiplayer interactive experiences in combination with Tangible User Interfaces (TUI) – a type of interface that combines physical objects and digital interfaces– adding the therapeutic benefit gained from manipulating physical objects. </em></p>

Naše teme i ideje se redovno nadopunjuju i uređuju, oblikuju i selektiraju kako bi bile potkrijepljene znanosti, iskustvom i praksom.   Upravo tamo svoje znanje i iskustvo nesebično rado dijelimo već četiri godine te dolazimo u doticaj s mnogim izazovima poput intolerancija i alergija na hranu, suplementacije, izbirljive djece. Zajedničkim radom savjete, znanje i vlastito iskustvo preko provjerene stručne literature i iskustva drugih mama pretvorile smo u sastojke s kojima smo „skuhali“ našu kuharicu.  Što je najvažnije – recepte smo testirali na najvećim kritičarima – djeci.   Brinemo za zdravlje i sreću naših najdražihU današnje vrijeme problem je i prekomjerna tjelesna težina djece što dovodi do ozbiljnih zdravstvenih posljedica te predstavlja čimbenik rizika za razvoj kroničnih bolesti kao što su dijabetes tip 2, bolesti srca i krvnih žila, bolesti mišićno-koštanog sustava i zloćudnih novotvorina. Istovremeno, djeca i adolescenti koji se hrane uglavnom biljnom prehranom imaju veći unos antioksidansa i prehrambenih vlakana te manju sklonost pretilosti. Američka Akademija za prehranu i dijetetiku i Nutricionisti Kanade, jedni od najvećih svjetskih autoriteta na području znanosti o prehrani, još su 2003. godine iznijeli stajalište da je adekvatno isplanirana vegetarijanska prehrana (uključujući i potpuno biljnu prehranu)  prikladna za sve stadije životnog ciklusa uključujući trudnoću, dojenje, dojenačko razdoblje, djetinjstvo i adolescenciju, kao i  da osigurava zdravstvene dobrobiti u prevenciji i liječenju određenih bolesti.  Danas, kada se voće i povrće te cjelovite žitarice i mahunarke nalaze sve rjeđe na našim tanjurima, prehrambeni stručnjaci potiču i podupiru interes za biljnu prehranu.  Putem društvenih mreža i grupe došli smo do zaključka da se dosta članova osjećalo usamljenim u svojim nastojanjima da djeci nude kvalitetne i cjelovite namirnice.Pored mnoštva upita na Facebook stranici Vege mama  i kroz privatne poruke koje svakodnevno primamo nije bilo druge, nego stvoriti jedan praktičan, edukativan, lako primjenjiv i zabavan priručnik za sve one koji su (kao i što smo mi same bile) izgubljeni u mnoštvu informacija. Izazovi odrastanja Baš danas Vaše dijete možda odluči da ne vole jabuku (a vi ste nabavili baš one najukusnije i uz to organske), ali možda voli sok od jabuke? Možda gumene bombone koje ćete napraviti za samo 10 min od 3 sastojka? Ili energetske pločice?   
Imamo rješenje! Riznica znanja- Zeleni život vege mama
 Odgovore na ta i još mnoga druga pitanja skupile smo u knjigu. Pa upoznajmo ju :) Knjiga se sastoji od 3 cjeline: U prvoj cjelini obrađene su teme od šarenog biljnog tanjura i svih potrebnih nutrijenata. Dotaknuli smo se i uvijek zanimljivih tema poput vitamina D i B12, izvora kalcija i omega 3 masnih kiselina u biljnoj prehrani, ekoloških proizvoda i ekološkog otiska, soje, klijanja te  superhrane.Pozvali smo mnoge super namirnice, poput gospođe tikvice i gospodina batata, da nam se i same predstave.     Drugi dio knjige posvećen je budućim majkama, trudnicama, dojiljama i bebama. Promjene koje se događaju u našem tijelu su čudesne, a drugo stanje zahtjeva i druga pravila. Tu se nalaze odgovori na pitanja poput treba li jesti za dvoje? Na koje nutrijente treba paziti?  Kako si pomoći kod pojave tegoba u trudnoći, ali i primjere biljnog jelovnika za prvo, drugo i treće tromjesečje te u vrijeme dojenja. Kada krene dohrana puno je upitnika u glavama novih mama i tata. Preporuke se mijenjaju, brišu i dodaju. U ovom dijelu knjige vodile smo se vlastitim istraživanjima, iskustvom i stručnim saznanjima kako bi upoznavanje s hranom prošlo što jednostavnije, kako za roditelje tako i za djecu.  Treći dio knjige je naša kuharica, koja osim recepata objašnjenih  korak po korak, donosi i praktične savjete o zamjenama za određene namirnice, o alternativnom načinu pripreme te prilagodbe recepta za bezglutensku prehranu ili recepta pogodnog za alergičare. Osim recepata tu se kriju i  primjeri jelovnika sakupljenih od iskusnih vegemama.Što nam je potrebno?Za izradu naše edukativne knjige potrebno nam je 10 000$.  Podržite nas :)Kao dugogodišnje zaljubljenice u zdravu biljnu prehranu, dolaskom naših malih blaga i same smo se našle pred  velikim izazovom i pitanjem kako ispravno hraniti dijete slijedeći i dalje isti način prehrane. Stručne literature na hrvatskom jeziku jednostavno nije bilo. Do sad.   Prvi koraci biljne prehrane od sada su puno jednostavniji, šareniji i zabavniji, a ova knjiga neka bude desna ruka u prehrani cijele obitelji.    Hvala našim podržavateljima I najmanjom donacijom korak smo bliže cilju, zato vas molimo da podržite našu kamapanju:

 PODACI ZA VAŠE DONACIJE:Udruga ""Yoga za djecu Slonić""IBAN: HR6523400091110928225 ********** WELCOME TO OUR STORY IN ENGLISH **********Hi guys!We are two moms who decided to collect all our know-how and experience into this all-encompassing green paper treasury. We are Ivana Šimić with an MS in Nutrition, and Iva Janeš with a Master’s in Economics and the creator of the Facebook group ˝Zeleni život vege mama˝ (The Green Life of Veggie Moms).  Green Life of Veggie MomsThe ˝Green Life of Veggie Moms˝ group was founded with the idea in mind that all knowledge on a plant-based diet should be located in one place and easily accessible to all. Our topics and ideas are regularly updated, edited and selected in accordance to the latest discoveries in science, as well as on experience and practice.   We have been selflessly sharing knowledge and experiences for the past four years now via our Facebook group during which time we’ve come across many challenges, including intolerance to food and food allergies, supplements, and picky eaters. By working together, we were able to utilize advice, knowledge and personal experience as ingredients of our cookbook. For that final touch we used verified experts and scientific sources, other moms’ experiences, and most importantly- we've tested the recipes on our greatest critics – children.  We care for the health and happiness of our dearest Excessive body weight and obesity in children are constantly rising . That is undoubtedly becoming a global health problem of our modern society.  Obesity and being overweight lead to serious health problems and are considered risk factors in the development of chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, heart and blood vessel diseases, muscular - skeletal disorders and malignant diseases. On the other hand, children and adolescents who mainly consume a plant-based diet have a higher intake of antioxidants and dietary fiber, and a lower likelihood of obesity.In as early as 2003, the American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and Nutritionists of Canada, one of the world's largest dietary nutrition authorities, had already set forth the notion that an adequately planned vegetarian diet (including a plant-based diet) was suitable for all stages of life, including during pregnancy, breastfeeding, childhood and adolescence. They also asserted that a vegetarian diet provided the health benefits necessary for the prevention and treatment of certain diseases.   Today, when fruits and vegetables, whole grains and legumes are greatly missing from our plates, it is the role of nutritionists to encourage and support plant-based nutrition.Through our engagement on social networks and various groups, we’ve discovered that a lot of members felt alone in their efforts to provide quality and complete organic food for their children.Following the numerous inquiries on our Facebook page and in private messages received on a daily basis, we decided to create a practical, educational, easy-to-use and entertaining manual for all of those who are ,as we once were, lost in the overwhelming amount of information available. The challenges of growing upOftentimes, anything could pose a real challenge with children.Today may be the day they decide they do not like apples (and you've just purchased the most delicious and organic ones). So, we need to think creatively – could they like apple juice instead?Pancakes with apples? Or perhaps apple gummy candy that takes only 10 minutes to make by using 3 ingredients alone, or even raw bars instead…  We have the solution! The answers to these and many other issues were collected and included in this book. Let's get to know all of its facets. The book is divided into three units: The first part discusses the colorful plant-based nutrition and all of the necessary nutrients. We've also covered some very interesting topics like proteins, vitamin D and B12, calcium and omega sources, organic products and the ecological footprint, demystifying soybeans, sprouting and ˝superfood˝. We have invited many Super heroes, including Mrs. Zucchini and Mr. Sweet Potato, to introduce themselves to us.                The second part of the book is devoted to pregnant women, nursing mothers, babies and all future mothers.While the changes taking place in our bodies can be miraculous, being pregnant still requires implementing different rules. This section includes answers to questions such as whether one needs to eat for two while pregnant, which nutrients should we be careful while consuming, how to solve various problems when they arise during pregnancy. It also includes examples of plant-based menus for the first, second and third trimester, as well as during breastfeeding. When introducing babies to solid foods, there are always so many question marks and dilemmas that parents face. Recommendations are always evolving and changing. In this part of the book, we used our own research, experience and professional knowledge to make food easier to understand for both children and parents.  The third part of the book includes our own personal cookbook, which, in addition to detailed and clarified recipes, also provides practical advice on replacements for certain foods, alternative ways of preparing and adjusting recipes for a gluten-free or an allergy-friendly diet.In addition to the recipes, there are also specific menus that we collected from other experienced “green” moms. What we need?We require 10 000 $ in order to make this book a reality.  Support us :)As long-time enthusiasts of healthy plant-based diets, and with the arrival of our precious children, we faced an enormous challenge and dilemma regarding how to properly feed our babies by keeping in mind our own diets. Even more challenging was the fact that there was no pertinent literature on the topic written in Croatian. Not until now, that is. :)The first steps to the plant-based diet will be easier, more colorful and entertaining from now on. So, allow this book to be your ˝right hand˝ when choosing the optimal diet for your entire family.  Thanks to our supporters Even with the smallest donation we are one step closer to making this dream a reality, so please support us:

<h3>Learn to Program a Walking Robot</h3>
<p>Get in and modify the quadruped walking code. All the software is Open Source. You’ve been watching those videos of Boston Dynamics robots. This is your chance to learn some of that! The code included in the Intellisaurus kit is fully functional, so you don’t have to know how to program a walking robot. But, if you want to, the world would love to see you make improvements and share them.</p>
<p>To modify your Intellisaurus programming does require that you are comfortable with the Arduino development environment. The code base is not simple, it required months of development. Modification of the walking code is not intended for the beginner. We provide a base of code that actually works as a walking quadruped. We intend for you, the experienced programmer, to get in and modify it.</p>

<h3>Learn Artificial Intelligence</h3>
<p>When you include the Artificial Intelligence Package you can build an intelligent robot that sees, speaks and understands. Then you can reprogram it, and reach new intellisaurus heights!<br/>With the Raspberry Pi, audio hat, speaker, and camera, you can experiment with Google’s neural network APIs and create intelligence.<br/>Use the camera and Google’s Vision API to see faces, detect emotions and recognize common objects. Then the robot can react to that knowledge, like turning and walking towards a face, or avoiding vegetables.<br/>Use the microphone and speaker to allow your robot to respond to voice commands. Or use the Google Assistant API to build an intelligent robot that can understand you, and respond when you ask it a question, or tell it to do something.</p>

<p>Jacquin has 30 years experience in product development. He has been the director of Software Development for multiple startup companies. He has been involved in the full product development life cycle including manufacturing, electronics and software development.</p>
<p>Jacquin Buchanan is a fountain of ideas and projects, which often ensnare and inspire those around him. Way back in College he was an aspiring sculptor who instead choose to pursue his other passion of computer science. Intellisaurus is a way for him to reignite some of his passion for sculpture and design and mix it with his extensive engineering experience.  </p>
<p>In 1991, Jacquin was a founder of in-sync, the digital video editing software company which made Speed Razor one of the original nonlinear digital video editors.</p>
<p>He has enjoyed directing software development with Voxtec International Inc. We built the first handheld, speech to speech, natural language translator, the Phraselator. Then went on to improve it. The SQ.410 is as close to a handheld universal translator as anyone has gotten.</p>
<p>He relocated recently to Fort Collins, Colorado, where he lives, loves, and chants with his artist wife and his talkative son.</p>
<h2>Delivery Schedule</h2>
<p>I am very confident in the design of this robot. All the prototypes function well. All the electronics are relatively standard, and don't require any new boards to be manufactured. I am not sure how timely certain suppliers will be with a couple of the parts, so I have given a little extra time for this in expected delivery dates. <br/><br/>Most of the effort from now to delivery will be completing the dozen instructional videos. This is relatively low risk work, and should not impact delivery schedules. I have many ideas for more instructional videos of projects that can be done with this kit. So, expect a continuous flow of potential projects.</p>
</div></div>","WHAT CAN I DO WITH INTELLISAURUS?
Intellisaurus is intended for many skill levels. The easy to follow instructions allow someone with a modest skill level to assemble the robot and have it walking in a matter of hours. There is no soldering or programming required to build and play with it. With a little more in-depth involvement you can connect the AI hardware and enable Google Assistant or Alexa. Impress your friends with a smart speaker that also walks. If you consider yourself a true maker or hacker then get into the Source code and modify it. Or, customize the shell in your favorite 3D modeling software and print new parts. You decide!

<p>Our Child, Not Yours will fight against the erroneous claim of government that it has the authority to intrude upon and interfere with the right of parents to raise their own children. How? By standing side by side with parents and their children through carefully selected litigation that will protect the right of the parent or parents with whom we join AND, as a result, also for other parents and their families by the precedential impact and the deterrent impact!</p>
<p> Illustrations of government’s overreaching:</p>
<p> 1.  A child is hurt and an insurance company offers to settle the claim.  The parents must get court approval, that is, permission, by first paying a filing fee.  The court may appoint a “guardian ad litem” who is paid by the parents and, depending on the amount, the parents must post a bond, open a separate bank account and cannot use the money even for the child without seeking and getting court permission.</p>
<p> 2.  Two parents who are divorcing agree on a parenting plan including all of the custody terms for their children, but the court can <em>reject the plan of the parents</em> and, instead, substitute the judge’s own parenting plan that the judge thinks is better for the child than the plan of the child’s own parents.</p>
<p> 3.  In 2007, Texas <em>mandated</em> by executive order from the governor that all females entering the sixth grade receive the HPV vaccine, with some exceptions.  Later overridden by the Texas legislature, concerns were raised about the drug's cost, safety, and parents' rights to refuse for any reason including moral objections related to a vaccine mandate for a sexually transmitted disease.</p>
<p> 4.  In 2012, in North Carolina, a school confiscated the turkey on whole-wheat sandwich and the other items of a home-packed lunch and gave the student the cafeteria lunch because the home-packed lunch did not meet the school’s nutritional requirements.  The child did not eat the chicken nuggets she was given.  The child was not in medical need, was not nutritionally deficient, and neither obese nor underweight.  <strong></strong></p>
<p>Through carefully selected legal actions to start or to join, through the education of the public and public servants, and through research and analysis, Our Child, Not Yours will protect the constitutional rights of parents – all parents, married or unmarried, mothers and fathers, to raise their children free from the mandates and prohibitions of government except as is constitutionally permitted to keep children from harm, which is a legitimate and constitutionally permitted purpose of government. To further this mission, Our Child, Not Yours also will advise and guide parents who are battling government and will educate and train law students, attorneys and those advancing the cause of freedom to parent one’s own children in the methods of such public interest activism.</p>
<p>After determining that no other entity seeks to protect the rights of all parents by using only the Untied States Constitution as its guide, Our Child, Not Yours was founded to be the civil liberties law firm that will do so.  Though a “law firm,” it is a non-profit law firm where the attorneys advising parents and litigating for them will do so without being paid exorbitantly, but reasonably as set by an unpaid Board of Directors, comprised of parents, Moms and Dads.  Our Child, Not Yours will undertake innovative litigation in the state and federal courts and will influence public attitudes on behalf of parents whose Constitutional rights are to be protected from infringement by the government.</p>
<p>Of course, if a child is being harmed, it is constitutionally permissible for the government to intervene. In all other circumstances, Our Child, Not Yours will sue the government and individuals acting on behalf of the government when either unconstitutionally takes away or attempts to take away the rights of a parent to raise her or his child or children as the parent wishes.</p>
<p>The funding being raised will permit Our Child, Not Yours to take on cases and walk the walk, not just talk the talk.  The funds will pay for the website, costs of raising public awareness, and a period of modest overhead permitting Our Child, Not Yours to move from idea to action.</p>
<p>The impact will be most realized for the parents and their children represented by Our Child, Not Yours.  But the trickle-down impact will be dramatic for all parents and all children.  Taxpayers will benefit by the restrictions put in place to stop the expansion of government into micromanaging parents in their efforts to raise their own children.  Personal liberties will be restored for parents doing a fine job with their children.  Resources wasted in overseeing good parents can be reallocated to help children in need, children being hurt, abused or neglected where government rightfully should intercede.  You can make a difference – today and in the years and decades to come.</p>

The impact will be most realized for the parents and their children represented by Our Child, Not Yours.  But the trickle-down impact will be dramatic for all parents and all children.  Taxpayers will benefit by the restrictions put in place to stop the expansion of government into micromanaging parents in their efforts to raise their own children.  Personal liberties will be restored for parents doing a fine job with their children.  Resources wasted in overseeing good parents can be reallocated to help children in need, children being hurt, abused or neglected where government rightfully should intercede.  You can make a difference – today and in the years and decades to come.

We can’t wait to introduce our newest bright idea, one that we think will really add some sparkle to the experiences our 25,000 visitors have each year.</p>
<h3>The Orpheum wants to bring a new exhibit - Light Bright Create - to the Museum, but we need your help to do it!</h3>
<p>Covering over 300 square-feet, our exhibit will feature a 6 foot by 4 foot Giant Light Bright Create! With room for nearly 1000 colored pegs, the exhibit will empower children to create vibrant designs, investigate color combinations, and play with patterns on a grand scale. This low-pressure environment will encourage children to experiment, boosting confidence in the ability to take something from their imagination and create it.</p>
<p>Constructed from colored acrylic rods, wood, and LEDs the Light Bright Create will have a simple but effective design. The exhibit will be located on the mezzanine level of the museum in an area where visitors’ creations will truly shine. </p>
<p>We won't stop there though! We have big plans that would expand the Light Bright Create into a whole set of Giant Games!</p>
<p>For more information about the campaign, be sure to watch this interview with Associate Director Caitlin Lill on the WCIA Morning Show: <a href=""http://illinoishomepage.net/fulltext/?nxd_id=410532"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://illinoishomepage.net/fulltext/?nxd_id=410532</a></p>

<h2><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>The Benefits of Playing Games</strong></span></h2>
<p>Games help children develop critical math and logic skills. Games teach children about patterns, combinations, strategy, and thinking ahead. They also teach general life skills like turn-taking, patience, communication, and collaboration.</p>
<p>Light Bright Create in particular will provide a unique pathway to learning. It will stimulate the imaginations of visitors, arouse curiosity, and encourage creativity. It will contribute to the development of visual perception and color recognition, as well as important motor skills in younger children like eye-hand coordination and manual dexterity. Making the game GIANT adds to the impact by increasing the levels of fun and engagement; this also allows more than one child to play at a time, which is necessary in an informal learning environment.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Benefits to the Community</strong></span></h2>
<p>Children’s museums help children develop essential foundational skills that are no longer addressed in many schools and provide opportunities for quality interactions between children and their families or peers. Research from the University of Illinois finds that children feel bored as much as 50 percent of the time while at school or doing their homework. At children’s museums, kids become excited about what they are learning while they are playing. As multidisciplinary institutions, children’s museums are defining how to teach the arts, humanities, sciences, mathematics and human relations across generations. The Light Bright Create in particular will use art and excitement to provide a gateway to learning, inspiring kids across East Central Illinois to gain confidence in their ability to enjoy science and math.  </p>
<p>Contributing to our IndieGoGo campaign will also benefit not just yourself but the entire community! Funders aren’t just donors but active participants in bringing quality science education to children and families throughout Champaign County. Contributing also directly benefits <strong>your</strong> family, as anyone giving $25 or more will receive tickets to the museum and access to the new installation. We’ll also be hosting a full-day exhibit opening in September, which is the perfect benefit for museum members! </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></span></h2>
<p>Can't contribute financially to bringing Light Bright Create to the Orpheum? That's ok! We encourage you to share this via social media sites like <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Orpheum-Childrens-Science-Museum/21740485579?ref=hl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">facebook</a> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/OrpheumMuseum"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">twitter</a>, tell you friends about it, and put up posters in places you frequent. This is a community effort and we can't do it without your support. Plus, once the exhibit is installed everyone will be welcome to visit and enjoy! </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Stretch Goals: Giant Games Series</strong></span></h2>
<p>This campaign doesn’t have to stop at just Light Bright Create. The original $3500 goal will get us there, but we believe we can do even better than that! To that end, we’ve developed a series of stretch goals to provide incentive to raise more funds and bring more Giant Games to the Orpheum. With additional funding we'll expand our efforts to refurbish and construct four different games exhibits this fall! Check them out below!</p>
<p>If we get <strong>$4000</strong>…the first step will be to fix the Giant Kaleidoscope! This links perfectly to the light experiments that visitors will conduct with the Light Bright Create, and gives us the chance to educate children about light waves and reflections.</p>
<p>If we get <strong>$4500</strong>…we’ll bring back Giant Chess! Particularly effective at teaching strategy and the importance of thinking ahead, Giant Chess is a great way for kids and families to interact!</p>
<p>If we get <strong>$6000</strong>…we’ll round out the “Giant Games” at the Orpheum with a HUGE version of the game Operations! With lessons about biology, medicine, and the importance of hand-eye coordination, Giant Operations is sure to bring educational fun to thousands of visitors!</p>
<p>If we get <strong>over $6000</strong>...it won't be hard to imagine new, exciting exhibits and programs! We'll update this section with new goals as we raise funds.</p>

<h2><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Our Commitment</span></strong></h2>
<p>The Orpheum Children’s Science Museum is dedicated to providing high quality experiences for the community. We promise that 100% of funds raised through IndieGoGo will go towards exhibit construction and program development. All exhibits and programs will be designed with educational goals in mind.</p>

<h2><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Why IndieGoGo?</strong></span></h2>
<p>Something you may be wondering is why we’re using IndieGoGo to raise the funds for these exhibits. Three reasons:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>-       With IndieGoGo, we can reach a lot of people quickly through a familiar medium. Since the Orpheum is 100% privately funded, we rely on our community to help us bring inspiring new exhibits and programs to the museum each year. IndieGoGo makes this process easy – and fun – for everyone involved!</p>
<p>-       We’re hoping to expand our methods of raising funds and going directly to the community for support at any level. Even $1 helps us, and IndieGoGo enables people to contribute at whatever level is comfortable for them and still receive recognition for it. Furthermore, IndieGoGo isn’t like other donation sites - you’ll be directly receiving goods and services for what you contribute, essentially letting us know that you support our efforts <strong>before</strong> we start them. </p>
<p>-       Third, with IndieGoGo you can donate directly through PayPal.  Unlike Kickstarter, IndieGoGo allows us to receive charitable contributions. Because the Orpheum is a non-profit organization your donations to the Orpheum through PayPal may be tax deductible!</p>

<p>Turn Up the <strong>BASE</strong> (Building Advocates through Social Justice Education) is a program born out of the minds and experiences of Mira Salas and Karen Cortez.  Many of you who know us, know our passion and unwavering commitment to youth and social justice.  While we both work with youth on a daily basis and undoubtably inject social justice into our work, we wanted to create a program where we could combine our two passions in the form of social justice education. </p>
<p>Turn Up the <strong>BASE </strong>is 3 day, 2 night social justice education mini conference for gender marginalized (young womyn, transgender, and gender queer) youth of color ages 14-18.  We hope to create a space where youth examine gender through personal and shared experiences of discrimination and begin to think critically about gender roles and stereotypes.  We will then challenge youth to think about how they can make a difference and enact social change in their community.  Youth will walk away with a sense of empowerment, community, and skills to become effective agents of change.  <strong>**And the best part is- it is free, free, FREE for all participants!! ** </strong></p>
<p>Turn Up the <strong>BASE</strong> will be facilitated through interactive activities, exercises, workshops, and discussion.  Youth participants will also have an opportunity to earn a scholarship as well as raffle prizes and giveaways. </p>
<p>The conference will take place at <strong>Point Reyes Hostel on Friday, August 3-Sunday, August 5, 2012</strong>.</p>
<p>Karen and Mira have a combined 8 years of experience working with youth.  In addition, Mira has organized similar retreats for young womyn. </p>
<p>We, our supporters, and youth in the community are super excited about this project!  With your help, we can see it through! </p>

<h3>We Need YOU!</h3>
<p>We need your love, your support, and, of course, your <strong>money</strong>!  Our budget is $4000 exactly which covers accomodations, food, supplies, transportation for the youth, and incentives such as our scholarship.  You can check out our budget in the gallery.</p>
<p>In exchange, we are offering our lovely Thank You gifts described in detail to the right.  Beyond that, you get to take part in our FIRST, of what we hope will be many, Turn Up the BASE conference.  Support our youth, create a vital counter space, and take part in history!</p>
<h3>What Else Can You Do?</h3>
<p>A lot!  We understand that not everyone can support financially and even if you can there are other ways to get involved! </p>

<h3>Who we are:</h3>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Sport Against Poverty was created with a dream of developing sustainable soccer programs in Kenya for the underprivileged youth. This can be accomplished through the formation of partnerships with local Kenyan schools that will make our projects self-sufficient long before we ever leave the area. Our mission is to partner athletics with education to provide children with opportunities for advancement, both on and off the field. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">We believe, whole-heartedly, in the power of sports to motivate youth and transform lives. Personally, we have been fortunate enough to participate in sports from a very young age, and through this, we have witnessed the ability that sports possess to encourage focus and growth in all aspects of life. Our simple goal is to provide these children with that same opportunity—the opportunity to use their talents to achieve success.  By providing these children with access to coaches, equipment, and academic incentives, we hope to facilitate a program wherein the youth can rise up and reach their full potential. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">We have made two previous trips to Kenya (2005, 2007) and one to South Africa (2010) to build these relationships. We have also partnered with Sporting KC (Formerly the Kansas City Wizards) and SoccerPro.com and have been featured on their websites several times.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""><strong>What We Need:</strong></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">We are looking to raise enough funds to travel to Kenya and break ground on some of our programs. We aren’t looking to ship over a few supplies and move on because shoes will wear out, fields will need repair, and balls will lose air. We are striving to create sustainable programs that will run long after we have left, and the only way to do that is through forming individual and personal relationships with schools on the ground in Kenya. All of the money will be spent locally and none of our supplies will be outsourced. At the core of our mission is a focus on sustainability, and we believe the only way to achieve that is through introducing currency paired with opportunity into local economies. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Funding will be used for:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class=""li3""><span class=""s1"">Travel Costs (Roughly $3,500): Flight, Vaccines, Food. </span></li>
<li class=""li3""><span class=""s1"">Field refurbishments: Goals, Nets, Turf Management. </span></li>
<li class=""li3""><span class=""s1"">Equipment: Shoes, Shin-Guards, Balls, Gloves, Numbered Jerseys, Cones.</span></li>
<li class=""li3""><span class=""s1"">Local Labor: Identifying and training coaches, mentors, etc. </span></li>

<div> </div>
<div>This fall, I have the opportunity to participate in two international service projects in conjunction with my graduate program in Occupational Therapy at Pacific University. 
<p>In October, my classmates and great friends, Nicole and Liz, will be joining me as we travel to Dhaka, Bangladesh to provide services at the Centre for the Rehabilitation of the Paralyzed.  For the past year we have helped pioneer this adventure to Bangladesh through a brand new partnership with the <a href=""http://crp-bangladesh.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Centre for the Rehabilitation of the Paralyzed (CRP)</a> and Pacific University.  Over the course of 10 weeks, we will work to integrate children with disabilities into their families and communities by providing rehabilitation therapy, caregiver training and disability education.  CRP is one of the only facilities in Bangladesh to provide services to people with disabilities (though the disabled make up 10% of this country’s 140 million population).  The lack of service is due to a history of violence, negative perceptions and superstitious fears about disability within the region.  </p>
<p>After working in Bangladesh, Nicole and I will then travel to Nicaragua for 10 days to provide health care to elders living in nursing homes, called “hogars”.  This partnership is an <a href=""http://www.pacificu.edu/chp/international/nicaragua/index.cfm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">interdisciplinary service project</a> involving 13 hogars and Pacific University’s health professions students, of which we are proud to have been selected to provide Occupational Therapy services. This trip is sponsered by the <a href=""http://www.jfrfoundation.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jesse F. Richardson Foundation</a>, a nonprofit specializing in projects to improve conditions for adults in poverty. </p>
<p>Both locations will provide me with different opportunities to develop cultural competency, empathy, and open-mindedness while helping provide services for people who experience discrimination due to their disabilities and often lack resources for appropriate care.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>WHAT I NEED</strong></p>
<p>I could use your support in many ways.  The first and most important thing, please pray for me as I prepare for this challenging educational mission (and for Brian who will be staying in Portland). </p>
<p>I also will need some financial support to make this trip possible. I expect the trips to cost about $6,000 for room, board and airfare expenses. I am working to supply some of the cost through scholarships and financial aid, and every bit of support helps.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>A close family friend graduated from college and selflessly found her true calling shortly thereafter in Botswana where she and a friend started an orphanage. Together, they have worked with local women to grow this wonderful seed into a very special place for sick and abandoned children in the village.</p>
<p>However, the orphanage is still very young, and they continue to struggling with money. My grandmother has taken it upon herself to crochet hats and blankets for each of the children who are staying at the orphanage as a way of helping out from halfway across the world.</p>
<p>This is my grandmother's passion. She loves to crochet and has created and given away hundreds of handmade items for free, all made from materials that she purchased herself. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My grandmother has purchased all of the yarn with her own money, and has spent weeks on this project. She has enjoyed every stitch of it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we simply cannot afford to ship them to the village. As a result, we are asking for your help. Our goal of $500.00 will cover shipping, yarn reimbursement, and allow her to buy more yarn to continue making hats and blankets for the children. Any and all extra money will be donated directly to the Lobatse Orphanage.</p>
<p>It is important to note that if we do not reach our funding goal, all contributions will be refunded. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Helping us fund this project would be so amazing. Not only would you be helping the orphanage in Lobaste, Botswana, but you'll also help my grandmother fully realize her dream of helping people across the world.</p>

<p>Can you imagine how scared those kids must be?</p>
<p>Children who witness abuse have unique challenges to overcome. Growing up in an abusive home, they may have a radically different idea of ""normal"" relationship behaviour and the ways in which people express anger or frustration. Abuse in the home prevents them from receiving the consistent affection and nurturing that kids need. They may be scared, confused and isolated. The message they often receive is that 'Love' equals hurt and fear.</p>
<p>Being part of an abusive home is traumatic and as a result children can display many of the responses to trauma in their behaviour - depression, aggression, social withdrawal, physical symptoms like stomach aches or headaches are all common ways these children may respond. These ""behavioural issues"" are often labeled and ""diagnosed"" and at times may even lead to prescribed medications. They are labeled as bad kids, seen as bullies or may be marginalized from social groups.</p>
<p>Without intervention and support, children who witness abuse are at high risk of repeating the abusive behaviour they are growing up with, both as victims and as abusers. Boys who witness abuse have a 10x greater risk of repeating abusive behaviour in adult relationships.</p>
<p>Doesn't every child deserve better odds?</p>
<p>In addition to emergency support and shelter for women escaping domestic abuse, <a href=""http://www.transitionhouse.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Victoria Women’s Transition House </a>has been offering counselling, support and summer camps for children who witness abuse for more than 20 years. We have seen the amazing transformations that can happen when our counsellors give these children the supports and tools they need to learn about healthy boundaries, personal safety and positive ways to express emotions. We know from years of experience, the odds for these kids can be shifted and with support, they can build themselves a better future without abuse or violence. Working together, we can break the cycle of abuse for these children and prevent domestic abuse before it starts.</p>
<p>The key is working together. While the professional help of our counsellors is critical for their best chance of success, children need support and positive reinforcement from other adult mentors in their lives. Our counsellors are skilled and capable, however they are only one of the many adults these children interact with every day. Most important of all of the adults they encounter, of course, are their parents.</p>
<p>Our goal is to make a DVD that we can use to educate parents, as well as other adult mentors (such as teachers, aunts and uncles, school nurses) in the children’s lives, about the challenges these children face and that the behaviour issues they are seeing may be linked to witnessing abuse at home. The DVD will demonstrate, in an effective visual manner, some of the behaviours kids may exhibit, and the tools and resources that are available to help the child cope and overcome their trauma.</p>
<p>Transition House has effectively used DVD's as a learning tool in the past. We strongly believe that this DVD, with a focus on building a circle of support around kids who witness abuse, will make a huge impact on the ability of kids to break free from the abuse and violence they witnessed. This can allow them to build more hopeful and healthy lives as they grow.</p>
<p>Will you help us raise $5000 to create this DVD and so that we can let children who witness abuse know that love doesn't have to equal hurt? Please work with us to give these kids a chance at a more hopeful future.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We earned around 1/3 of our goal in the first round of funding and are so happy to have the project jump-started.  Now it's time to make this project last!</p>
<p>This project stems from a desire to give back to my community. </p>
<p>After winning a Rotary Scholarship to study music in South Africa, I wanted to find a way to give back to my community that gave me the opportunity to have this amazing experience, and I feel the best way is through youth &amp; education.</p>
<p>So while I am here studying what I love, I am trying build a pen-pal program between a highschool here in South Africa with my home highschool in the USA, to give students here and from my home a chance to explore a world outside themselves by connecting with each other.  I hope to open their eyes to the same wonderful opportunities that I've been fortunate enough to have &amp; to hopefully inspire them to engage.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>We need money to pay for:</p>
<p>-shipping of care packages exchanged between classrooms (this figure is based on 10kg and is roughly $300 per package, so one from each class is $600, depending on the weight)</p>
<p>- supplies to put the care package together: (cds for music, paper for letters, tape, a box, materials for kids to make jewelry if they wish, drawings, a book if they wish etc.)</p>
<p>-disposable cameras to give the kids so they can take photos and share them</p>
<p>-processing of photos taken by the kids</p>
<p>-the processing of photographic portraits of students that I am taking </p>
</div>

<p>The impact of this project is to connect youth with each other.  The most important aspect of this project is that more than letters, each classroom is putting together a package with letters, photos, and other goodies to share their culture and for each classroom to teach each other.</p>
<p>Long-term benefits range from potential life-long friendships between students and potentially international high-school exchanges or at least visits if the program is able to become sustainable and to connect more kids with each other.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
We earned around 1/3 of our goal in the first round of funding and are so happy to have the project jump-started.  Now it's time to make this project last!
This project stems from a desire to give back to my community. 
After winning a Rotary Scholarship to study music in South Africa, I wanted to find a way to give back to my community that gave me the opportunity to have this amazing experience, and I feel the best way is through youth & education.
So while I am here studying what I love, I am trying build a pen-pal program between a highschool here in South Africa with my home highschool in the USA, to give students here and from my home a chance to explore a world outside themselves by connecting with each other.  I hope to open their eyes to the same wonderful opportunities that I've been fortunate enough to have & to hopefully inspire them to engage.
What We Need & What You Get


We need money to pay for:
-shipping of care packages exchanged between classrooms (this figure is based on 10kg and is roughly $300 per package, so one from each class is $600, depending on the weight)
- supplies to put the care package together: (cds for music, paper for letters, tape, a box, materials for kids to make jewelry if they wish, drawings, a book if they wish etc.)
-disposable cameras to give the kids so they can take photos and share them
-processing of photos taken by the kids
-the processing of photographic portraits of students that I am taking 


The Impact
The impact of this project is to connect youth with each other.  The most important aspect of this project is that more than letters, each classroom is putting together a package with letters, photos, and other goodies to share their culture and for each classroom to teach each other.
Long-term benefits range from potential life-long friendships between students and potentially international high-school exchanges or at least visits if the program is able to become sustainable and to connect more kids with each other.

<h3><strong><em>Short Summary</em></strong></h3>
<p>In 2006, three school teachers from Melbourne, Australia decided that they wanted to get their students to realize that they have the capacity to make a positive difference in the world. They wanted their students to understand that they could be catalysts; dynamic forces for change. So, the teachers founded The Simunye Project which has inspired hundreds of people and raised over $100, 000 making a massive impact on the lives of local Australians and severely underprivileged communities in South Africa.</p>
<p>The Simunye Project guarantees that all sponsorships and fundraised money goes to those people who need it most. Focusing in on 4 organisations, the Project builds and renovates facilities, delivers food programs, trains teachers, improves health and sanitation and runs holiday programs all in a sustainable and impactful way.</p>
<p>‘Simunye’ is a Zulu word meaning ‘We are one’ and calls on people to acknowledge that we are all part of the one humanity and that in order to live full and meaningful lives, we must help others to do the same.</p>
<p>Sponsorships from the smallest amount to the larger sums all make a real difference in the lives of these underprivileged communities. $100 will help feed a family for three months; $500 helps to sponsor a teacher; $1500 helps to build toilets and get rid of the threat of cholera; $10 000 builds a well and provides fresh water to an entire community; $15 000 is sufficient funds for a classroom.</p>
<p>It’s that easy.</p>
<p>One company decided not to have corporate planner for the year and sponsored that amount to the Simunye Project enabling us to build a well and improve the lives of an entire community forever.</p>
<p>So, what’s in it for you? Depending on the amount you sponsor you will have access to photographs, video footage and outstanding speakers. This allows you to leverage your sponsorship ensuring that employees and clients are fully aware of your commitment to social responsibility. There is even a 7 day experience in South Africa specifically designed for those busy people who would like to provide hands-on assistance.</p>

<div>
<h3><strong><em> </em></strong></h3>
<h3><strong><em>What We Need &amp; What You Get</em></strong></h3>
<p>This year our aim is to build another well (borehole) for Educare Daycare Centre. They are in desperate need of access to clean water to drink, to wash and to enable them to water their vegetable garden. A borehole will result in massively improved health and sanitation conditions, and in some cases will save lives. </p>
<p>This is a unique organization as young people are given the opportunity to work alongside local people to improve local conditions. The impact is real, sustainable and measurable. There are countless reports of improved health, work, social, academic and financial situations amongst individuals and communities. Furthermore, young people in Australia are changed forever as they see the power they have to change the world for the better.</p>
<p>We need as much or as little as you can give! 100% of the funds raised go directly to projects which help these communities. Through Indigogo, we are hoping to raise the $10 000.</p>
<p>No matter what we raise, we will be able to put it all towards one of the projects we will complete in 2013. There is no dollar that can't be put to good use!  </p>

<h3><em>T<strong>he Impact</strong></em></h3>
<p>There are countless stories from our work in South Africa that indicate the viability of the projects. In 2009, we were able to get rid of a hole in the ground that served as a toilet at a day care centre and build a toilet. The access to clean sanitation dramatically lowered the levels of cholera to virtually zero.</p>
<p>The local communities trust us deeply as year after year we return to make sustainable changes and improve their lives.</p>

</div><div>
<p></p>
<p><i>Campers</i></p>
<p>The Strong Camps are an opportunity for campers gain environmental literacy, health literacy, civic efficacy, and extra practice in many of their school subjects.  But most critically, they gain confidence.  And a girl with confidence in the power of her dreams generates all kinds of additional (and statistically shown) positive impacts, from her neighborhood to Washington.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><i>Instructors</i> </p>
<p>The Strong Camps provide a unique opportunity for instructors as well.  A position with Full Circles Foundation requires the a rare responsibility of both fine-tuning abstract ideas, <i>and</i> turning them into reality.  The challenges to executing the Strong Camps are not insignificant and require rigorous personal reflection as well.  This makes it all the more incredible to reflect upon success.  Campers are not the only ones who left the summer with a new-found sense of empowerment and purpose.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><i>Community</i></p>
<p>The planning and execution of the Strong Camps also provide an opportunity for community partners to come together for substantive, joyful conversations about the localized, integrated solutions that, together, we can build to meet modern crises.        </p>

</div></div>","Our Story
The Strong Camps:  Growing Strong Girls with Big Dreams
In June 2011, Full Circles Foundation, a project of Grand Aspirations, launched the Strong Camps, a six-week series of community-powered summer day camps that worked to illuminate the connections between personal, community, and environmental health for girls ages 5 through 17.  The camps were hosted in Raleigh, North Carolina, by area faith communities, and in partnership with a host of North Carolina partners.  

At Strong Home Camp, we canoed, explored North Carolina's forests and learned that ""everything [really] is hitched to everything else.""  We examined the connections between math and nature, and cooked delicious meals with local, whole food.  We planted our own herbs and made ""flower bombs,"" ideal for turning dusty cityscapes into fragrant oases for bumblebees!


At Strong Self Camp, we discovered the joy of upcycling, screen-printing by hand, and making our own all-natural body products.  The older girls had thought-provoking discussions about human rights, gender, and women in history.  We did yoga in the morning, made our own hula-hoops, wrote the official Full Circles Foundation anthem, and capped the camp off with an eclectic talent show!


At Strong Neighbor Camp, we learned about the importance of participatory governance and drafted, via consensus, our own camp guidelines.  We talked about ""the marketplace"" and visited local businesses and the farmer's market to learn first-hand what it is like being a local entrepreneur.  We explored the orienting power of shared stories (and the role we play in writing them) at the North Carolina history museum and on an afternoon rickshaw tour of Raleigh.  The older girls visited local colleges and universities, while the younger ones finally got the much-desired trip to the pool. 

It was a transformative summer, not only because the camps were amazing, but also because a central ethic of social entrepreneurship created real ownership and real community.  Each camp featured a microventure project that built financial and community resources.  Campers, families, and instructors would all come out to the monthly downtown Raleigh ""First Friday"" markets to talk to Raleigh neighbors about the connections between personal, community, and environmental health, and to offer our awesome goods - artisinal all-natural bath salts, screen-printed t-shirts, flower bombs, and hand-made hula hoops.      

Back to the Future
In summer 2012, Full Circles Foundation is preparing to expand the Strong Camps in Raleigh to include more girls, a veggie-diesel bus, an overnight Strong Home camp, and the integration of an apprentice program! 

Full Circles Foundation is also THRILLED to announce that a team of amazing women from Lexington, Kentucky, have decided to host a Strong Camps pilot program in their hometown!  Sharing lessons, dreams, and schemes, Raleigh and Lexington will co-develop complimentary programming that is founded on the same core principles, yet also unique to our own places.

The Impact of the Strong Camps


Campers
The Strong Camps are an opportunity for campers gain environmental literacy, health literacy, civic efficacy, and extra practice in many of their school subjects.  But most critically, they gain confidence.  And a girl with confidence in the power of her dreams generates all kinds of additional (and statistically shown) positive impacts, from her neighborhood to Washington.

Instructors 
The Strong Camps provide a unique opportunity for instructors as well.  A position with Full Circles Foundation requires the a rare responsibility of both fine-tuning abstract ideas, and turning them into reality.  The challenges to executing the Strong Camps are not insignificant and require rigorous personal reflection as well.  This makes it all the more incredible to reflect upon success.  Campers are not the only ones who left the summer with a new-found sense of empowerment and purpose.

Community
The planning and execution of the Strong Camps also provide an opportunity for community partners to come together for substantive, joyful conversations about the localized, integrated solutions that, together, we can build to meet modern crises.        


What We Need & What You Get


The goal for our holiday fundraising campaign is $2500.  While this may seem like a fair chunk of change, it's only the beginning of our 2012 resource-generation efforts.  Running a full 2012 Strong Camps series will cost about $30,000*, and we are going to be running two!  To put it a different way, a ""full scholarship"" for a camper would sum in the neighborhood of $500 (a bargain for a six week camp!) 

The funds that we raise allow us to offer free attendance to all qualifying campers.  The funds cover living-wage based stipends for instructors, camp materials, transportation, space, and camp meals.    

While we gratefully accept any amount of funding, check out the perks we have listed on the right side for our generous donors!  Every penny counts! 

* This number reflects the total value of the Strong Camps.  A significant percentage thereof is constituted by in-kind donations.

The Full Dish

In January 2011, a team of three determined women - young folks with audacious optimism, a pinch of experience, a desire to create empowering and sustainable models of living, and fairly threadbare pockets - launched a bold project in Raleigh, North Carolina, dedicated to growing strong girls, a fair economy, and a healthy planet.  It was called Full Circles Foundation.  

Their vision was to co-create a safe, empowering community that was rooted in an understanding of 


the indivisibility of personal, community, and environmental health (it's all connected!); 


the need for lateral power (networks!); 


the strength found in nurturing diverse perspectives, identities, skills, forms of intelligence, etc.; 


the importance of feedback mechanisms (often referred to as ""listening""); 


and the necessity of ""relational"" solutions to modern crises.  



This community would then do the impossible:  translate pretty words into praxis.   

It would provide a long-term continuum of think-outside-the-box adventures (also called ""programs"") for girls who have high potential but are facing big challenges.  These programs would weave together social entrepreneurship, democracy training, and interdisciplinary instruction in personal health & wellness, environmental literacy/natural sciences, creative communication, and mathematics.  And when we say ""long term,"" we mean that - best case scenario - a girl would be matriculated as a rising Kindergartner and Full Circles Foundation would hang out with her until she graduated from high school.  And the model would be self-sustaining!  And we were fairly convinced that this just might be a good enough idea that other communities might eventually want to replicate it!  


Pretty huge, right?  But it wasn't exactly clear how we were going to get from brainstorming around the kitchen table to the immense vision described above.



And then our fairy godmother showed up.  Her name was Grand Aspirations (www.grandaspirations.org).  She specializes in turning the dreams of ""young folks with audacious optimism, a desire to create empowering and sustainable models of living, and fairly threadbare pockets"" (pinch of experience not necessary) into reality.

<h3>My Story!</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Jennie Willingham. I'm a 27 year old studying to become a minister with the Unity church, a metaphysical Christian religious organization. I received a scholarship to take ministerial classes at Unity Village in Missouri, where the Unity Institute is located. The scholarship covers four classes and room and board--all I need is to do is get there!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This AMAZING scholarship expires in April, so the last opportunity I have to take classes is in March. Things have been rough recently--my father's been in the hospital, a friend recently passed away, I have a part time job (which I love) where I don't get enough hours to sustain myself, among several other stressful situations accumulating over the past few months. Taking these classes is a symbolic affirmation that things will get better and that I'm <em>exactly </em>where I'm supposed to be.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact!</h3>
<p>Taking these classes means the world to me. I want to help people, and to live in service. I haven't been able to afford to take classes over the past few years, and recently I've been having a bit of a crisis in faith. I feel very drawn to take these classes, to use this scholarship before it expires.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>As these courses lead to self-discovery, there's no doubt in my mind that I will return refreshed and inspired, and bring that new energy to every aspect of my life; to my volunteer positions working with high schoolers, middle schoolers, and young adults, as well as volunteering with domestic violence survivors, and among my friends and coworkers.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need!</h3>
<p>I need money for airfare and random travel expenses, as well as for a new (very inexpensive) camera to document and chronologize my trip. Pictures are very important to me, both for personal enjoyment and in sharing my memories with other people. I particularly want pictures to look back on once I'm a minister, to share my path with other people who think they may not be able to achieve their dreams.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Any contribution over $15 will receive a ""Thank You!"" postcard from Unity Village while I'm there.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>Service to the World was created for the Kentucky YMCA alumi to practice
 global citizenship through service learning, cultural exchange, and 
exposure to global YMCA movements. It is a capacity-building program 
that gives young adults the opportunity to promote youth development, 
healthy living, and social responsibility throuh work with YMCAs around 
the globe. This year, our inaugural STTW team will travel to Israel and 
the Palestinian Territories for two weeks of service and cultural 
immersion with the Jerusalem International YMCA, the East Jersusalem 
YMCA, and several other community organizations and NGO's. <br/><br/>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are proud to announce that this is the Kentucky YMCA Youth Association's first international service endeavor. Our plan is to create a sustainable model for our Service to the World program, along the lines of our Y-Corps Service program, so that we may continue to provide opportunities for young Kentuckians to serve and to learn.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>During these two weeks, our ultimate goal is to put the idea of global citizenship into practice.  We hope to accomplish this goal by building meaningful relationships with the Israeli and Palestinian people through service learning and cultural immersion. We want to know their stories and their lifestyles, their hopes and musings as individuals, and in turn, we want to share the same with them. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The mission of this program is not for us to ""fix"" problems or impart our own ideas for solutions, but rather to engage in a powerful learning process that might help us understand the history and nuances of a deeply complex issue from both sides.  We hope to humble ourselves in service with the goal of taking away a lesson or two in history, diplomacy, and the joy that is service learning.</p>
<p><br/> Another goal of this trip is to gain exposure to the incredible momentum that is the Global YMCA movement. We will learn what the YMCA's in Jerusalem, Tiberius, Ramallah, Beit Sahour, and Jericho are up to. We will work with a peace preschool, a women's job training center, a refugee camp, a guest retreat house, and other small NGO's. We will cross through the major cities of Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, and Haifa, up through the green mountains of the Golan Region and down through the Negev Desert in the south of Israel. We will journey into the West Bank and visit several major historical sites in a handful of cities. We will ask questions though the answers may evade us and we will meditate though we will find ourselves wrestling with the confrontation between loss and the endurance of the human spirit. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>With a globalized world in mind, with dreams of peace for our grandchildren, and with the hope of making a small impact in a major conflict in a mighty big world, we are honored to be the inaugural team and we are excited that you are interested in helping us see this vision through. <br/></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get<br/>
</h3>
<p>Each team member will be responsible for raising <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">$3,650</span>. With twelve team members that calls for a total of <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">$43,200</span> to pull this thing off! Right now we are setting our goal lower to see if we can capture an initial interest in our campaign (not to mention the site penalizes us if we don't reach our goal). If we can generate enough income to reach our <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">$6,000 goal</span>, that's <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">$500</span> off the top for each team member!<br/><br/>So, here it goes-- the break down of the $3,650/member...<br/><br/></p>
<ul>
<li>$1,600: The plane ticket to-and-fro, but of course.</li>
<li>$800: On-the-ground transportation. This is a HUGE cost for us-- renting a bus + having a guide/driver/living GPS for two whole weeks.</li>
<li>$400: Grub to fill our bellies for two weeks (roughly $7/meal x 3/day, plus snacks to sustain, and airport meals just in case).</li>
<li>$400: Staff overhead (at 1 staff member's $3650 cost) and a little extra to fund back into the sustainability of the program. <br/>
</li>
<li>$200: Our favorite part! $200 USD from each team member will be donated towards an NGO in Israel/Palestinian territories. That's nearly $2,500 proud bucks!<br/>
</li>
<li>$150: Most days we will have lodging at local YMCA's. On the days we don't (roughly around 4), we will have to stay at inexpensive hostels/hotels. </li>
<li>$100: Entrance into museums, parks, and other cultural learning activities including Masada National Park, the Golan Heights Winery, Ein Gedi Botanical Gardens, etc. </li>
</ul>

the globe. This year, our inaugural STTW team will travel to Israel and 
the Palestinian Territories for two weeks of service and cultural 
immersion with the Jerusalem International YMCA, the East Jersusalem 
YMCA, and several other community organizations and NGO's. 

The Impact
We are proud to announce that this is the Kentucky YMCA Youth Association's first international service endeavor. Our plan is to create a sustainable model for our Service to the World program, along the lines of our Y-Corps Service program, so that we may continue to provide opportunities for young Kentuckians to serve and to learn.

During these two weeks, our ultimate goal is to put the idea of global citizenship into practice.  We hope to accomplish this goal by building meaningful relationships with the Israeli and Palestinian people through service learning and cultural immersion. We want to know their stories and their lifestyles, their hopes and musings as individuals, and in turn, we want to share the same with them. 

The mission of this program is not for us to ""fix"" problems or impart our own ideas for solutions, but rather to engage in a powerful learning process that might help us understand the history and nuances of a deeply complex issue from both sides.  We hope to humble ourselves in service with the goal of taking away a lesson or two in history, diplomacy, and the joy that is service learning.
 Another goal of this trip is to gain exposure to the incredible momentum that is the Global YMCA movement. We will learn what the YMCA's in Jerusalem, Tiberius, Ramallah, Beit Sahour, and Jericho are up to. We will work with a peace preschool, a women's job training center, a refugee camp, a guest retreat house, and other small NGO's. We will cross through the major cities of Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, and Haifa, up through the green mountains of the Golan Region and down through the Negev Desert in the south of Israel. We will journey into the West Bank and visit several major historical sites in a handful of cities. We will ask questions though the answers may evade us and we will meditate though we will find ourselves wrestling with the confrontation between loss and the endurance of the human spirit. 

With a globalized world in mind, with dreams of peace for our grandchildren, and with the hope of making a small impact in a major conflict in a mighty big world, we are honored to be the inaugural team and we are excited that you are interested in helping us see this vision through.

What We Need & What You Get

Each team member will be responsible for raising $3,650. With twelve team members that calls for a total of $43,200 to pull this thing off! Right now we are setting our goal lower to see if we can capture an initial interest in our campaign (not to mention the site penalizes us if we don't reach our goal). If we can generate enough income to reach our $6,000 goal, that's $500 off the top for each team member!So, here it goes-- the break down of the $3,650/member...

$1,600: The plane ticket to-and-fro, but of course.
$800: On-the-ground transportation. This is a HUGE cost for us-- renting a bus + having a guide/driver/living GPS for two whole weeks.
$400: Grub to fill our bellies for two weeks (roughly $7/meal x 3/day, plus snacks to sustain, and airport meals just in case).
$400: Staff overhead (at 1 staff member's $3650 cost) and a little extra to fund back into the sustainability of the program. 

$200: Our favorite part! $200 USD from each team member will be donated towards an NGO in Israel/Palestinian territories. That's nearly $2,500 proud bucks!

$150: Most days we will have lodging at local YMCA's. On the days we don't (roughly around 4), we will have to stay at inexpensive hostels/hotels. 
$100: Entrance into museums, parks, and other cultural learning activities including Masada National Park, the Golan Heights Winery, Ein Gedi Botanical Gardens, etc. 

Check out our sweet incentives just to the right of this text. For every dollar you donate at the $25 level or above, you'll reap the benefits!

<p>We all feel passionately that there is a lack of education about miscarriage in this country, and even worse there is a real lack of support for those who experience it. 1 in 4 pregnancies ends in miscarriage, and yet almost nobody talks about it. We challenge that taboo in the name of being able to help those who are grieving when they need it most.</p>
<h3>Where does the money go?</h3>
<p>Although all our board members and doulas are volunteers, we still need some money for basic operating costs.</p>

<li>Website hosting</li>
<li>Printing expenses for passalong cards, brochures, and posters to hang in waiting rooms</li>
<li>Items for Healing Boxes for bereaved parents</li>
<li>Expenses related to the loss doula certification and support programs</li>
<li>Expanding our nonprofit status to additional states (currently we are only registered for tax exemption in one state) and to get federal 501c3 status</li>

Detroit Food Academy students Popy and Taryn selling zucchini muffins (made with applesauce instead of butter) and Michigan-sourced Mitten Bites (raw granola bites filled with oats, honey, and peanut butter) at the Downtown Market, Summer 2013


Results: As of August 15th, we completed another successful round of our Small Batch Entrepreneurship Camp with 10 young Detroiters launching their Zucchini Muffin and Mitten Bites businesses at four farmers' markets throughout the city. In 2.5 years of programming, we have taught 142 students and employed 100. (For most of them, we were their first job.) We have run 13 successful market stands and grossed $30,000 in sales. 
The Plan for 2013-2014: After 5 iterations and evolutions, we have solidified curriculum that WORKS. And we are ready to GROW. This $10,000 campaign is part of a larger $100,000 campaign to expand our program to 5 schools (7 cohorts) and 100 students. We are pursuing grants and corporate sponsorship, but individual contributions are an essential piece of diversifying our revenue streams and maintaining resiliency, so that we are not dependent on any single entity. We've all seen how that ends up...
Long Term Vision: By 2015, we envision working with 24 schools and 360 students. But as our education brand grows and our curriculum deepens, something even more exciting will be emerging alongside: Small Batch Detroit.
Small Batch Detroit will be an umbrella brand of shelf-stable values-based food products developed by our students, which will be distributed to corner stores, grocery stores, and supermarkets throughout the City, State, and even Country. All proceeds will generate revenue to deepen our work in schools and employ Food Academy graduates to grow alongside the brand, as well as have the opportunity to branch off on their own.
But we need YOUR SUPPORT to make this happen!

The basic idea behind Booketplace is to create a market for used college textbooks, allowing sellers to get in touch with buyers.
 
After watching our awesome video you will probably be able to understand that we are working extremely hard to provide a solution for all students to earn back some money from their used and now unnecessary books. Students spend $700 to $1,000 a year on books, think of what you could do with 70% of this money back in your pocket!
 
But that's not our only purpose, we believe that Booketplace allows people to become primary contributors in becoming eco-friendlier society. Today, we are tearing down tens of thousands of trees in order to print millions of books that are very rarely re-used. On the top of that, publishing industry lobbies greatly benefit from this trend which allows them to constantly increase their prices.
 
Today we are here on Indiegogo to ask for you help! We want to expand our app and release more exciting features, and we would appreciate your contribution. We can only do this together by strongly believing that we have to change of these ridiculous trends. We especially need your contribution if you firmly believe that Booketplace is a revolutionary tool.
 
There will be no more exaggerated costs for intermediaries, no grasping profits for publishers for new editions identical to the old, no waste of paper and trees for the production of additional issues that are likely to remain unsold for excess supply, reuse of books would otherwise be forgotten in some dusty shelf.
 
University students trying to make a big change in the society: this is the team!
 


Luca is an economics student at bocconi university in Milan. He has always been working as a coder and he just finished an internship at Google. He's currently in charge of the development of Bookletplace. 

 


Giacomo is a graduate (110/110 cum laude) in Economics and Management and is now doing a master in Management at Bocconi University. He is director of a company specialized in web consulence b2b since 2009 and project manager in Booketplace.
 


Enrico is a graduate in Biotech engineering from Politecnico Di Milano. He's passionate about computer science and he's currently working as a developer for Booketplace. 

 


Riccardo is a student at the faculty of Law at University of Milan. He’s focused on financial aspects of his law studies, and he is working as a consultant for a trust company based in Switzerland. 

 


Bastien has just been added to the team to take care of the marketing side of Booketplace. He has previously been interning for various start-ups such as iZettle. He has also a background in Finance and Luxury goods. Bastien is currently finishing up his Bachelor in Management at Bocconi University.

 
Booketplace is helping you being Eco-friendly!        
                            


According to a study conducted by California high schools, the average weight of a physics textbook is 4.8 pounds. Taking into account the most common modern paper-making techniques, it takes 12 trees to produce one ton of paper, according to Conservatree.org. This means each tree outputs about 167 pounds of paper. This figure represents paper made using the ""mechanical"" or ""groundwood"" process.    



Using the average figures for average textbook weight and average tree output, a result of 0.028 trees per textbook can be reached. Similarly, it is found that 34.8 textbooks can be produced from each tree. On a campus of 10,000 students, each with 6 textbooks, a total of 1,680 trees worth of paper is being used.


Imagine now that thanks to Booketplace books can have a second owner. This would imply a saving of 50% on the paper used to print the same book. As for our previous example Booketplace would save more than 840 trees!


Now multiply this figure for the 151 million university students in the world and think how many trees we can save!

 
Fighting publishers' lobbies
 


Academic Publishers will tell you that creating modern textbooks is an expensive, labor-intensive process that demands charging high prices. If professors tell their students to buy a certain book, students have little choice on what to do.


In the past years publishers have done just about everything within their power to increase their profits, from bundling textbooks with software that forces students to buy new editions instead of cheaper used copies, to suing a low-cost textbook start-ups over flimsy copyright claims. Students also reported negative impacts from the publishing industry's long-standing bad practices that inflate costs. 


93% of the students said at least one such practice had affected the price or resale value of their books.


College stores now routinely offer students the option of renting a hard copy textbook – the format actually preferred by 74% of college students. The number of college stores offering textbook rental over the past two years has skyrocketed, and such print-version rental programs can save a student between 45-66% off the price of a new print textbook.


In addition, college stores continue to work hard to increase their stock of used textbooks, a 25% savings for students, and digital, which can save students 40% off the new-text price. 


Nevertheless, those programs are only available in the US, which counts only for a small portion of the worldwide population.


But thanks to Booketplace, the average discount on a book can be up to 50%, making it the most competitive tool in the market. 

 
What We Need & What You Get
 


the funds we receive will be solely used for the development of the product. We have currently released a beta version of the application that contains the basic functionalities for the sale and purchase of a book. We plan to add many other features, to make the application increasingly fast, and work on the user-friendliness side of the app.


In particular, the next features in the development pipeline are: synchronization of the application database with that of amazon and google books, new user interface, an optimized experience for users with the latest versions of iOS and Android


To implement all of this we need at least 2 full-time programmers for six months, and the funds received will help us to pay (at least in part) their salary.


We will implement as many features as possible with all the money we can raise!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! My name is Hannah, and I am the founding English teacher (a.k.a. the only English teacher this year) at a <strong>NYC public school</strong> opening this fall.  I am trying to raise money to purchase books so that I can create a library of reading material in my classroom - and you can help!</p>
<p>Tons of studies have shown that when students have time, space, and resources to practice reading on their own, their literacy skills improve dramatically.  Kelly Gallagher, an English teacher and author of <em>Reading Reasons</em>, writes, ""My students now read many times more books than my students did during my first year [of teaching].  What's the key difference?  What accounts for this surge in reading?  Far and away the most important factor was <strong>the establishment of a classroom library</strong>.  I brought interesting books to my students.  I surrounded them with a variety of high-interest reading materials.""</p>
<p>This is exactly what I'm aiming to do.  I want to create a library full of interesting reading material so that my students - who come to me with a wide range of literacy levels - can improve their reading skills and enjoy reading for pleasure.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>I want to raise at least $500, all of which will go toward purchasing age-appropriate books for my students (YA novels, classic literature, graphic novels, non-fiction books, etc.).</li>
<li>If you contribute to this campaign, you will receive a letter of thanks from my students.</li>
<li>If the entire fundraising goal isn't met, I will still use the funds that are raised to purchase books for my classroom library.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution to this campaign will directly help NYC public school 9th graders build their literacy skills and become more competent, literate, and educated individuals.  </p>
