<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><br/>Crescent Earth is a mystery through time, full of adventure, heartbreak, and more than a few twists and turns.<br/><br/>My name is Ilia, and I am the author of Crescent Earth. I wrote this book because I’m obsessed with crime fiction, conspiracy theories, and, most of all, life and how we navigate our way through it. My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover something new, find answers you seek about yourself, let your imagination run wild. This is an opportunity to escape into the exciting world of the unexplained, to glimpse the future, and maybe even come to terms with the past.<br/><br/>In the future of 2130, human-like androids live among humans both on Earth and off-world, co-existing and sharing knowledge. When one such android kills James Mason’s father, James, accompanied by his partner, Tom, will have to chase the robot to the Moon base of Peary-I. But on his path to revenge, James will uncover his dark family history and enter the world of espionage, conspiracy, and flying saucers.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you grew up on The X-Files and The Twilight Zone, if you enjoy mystery and science fiction that deals with the unexplained.<br/><br/>Crescent Earth speaks to sci-fi fans who want to grapple with the themes of love and loss in a new, exciting way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that Crescent Earth inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can we cope with death and move on with our lives?</li>
<li>What would we do differently if we could turn back time?</li>
<li>Do we have a say in life, or is it all predetermined?</li>
</ul>
<p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing love, family relations, and the unbearable weight of the past will change us all for the better.</p>
</div><h3>
<br/><br/>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3><p><br/>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:</p><ul>
<li>The <strong>editor</strong> I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in August 2021</li>
<li>The <strong>cover design</strong> of my book. (The mockups you see currently are a placeholder!)</li>

<li>The <strong>copy editing</strong> for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.</li>
<li>The <strong>launch &amp; promotion efforts</strong> for my book when I ultimately publish this Summer of 2021.</li>
</ul><p><br/>When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish a paperback and ebook. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover and an audiobook.<br/><br/><br/>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:</p><ul>

A few mushrooms spotted in the woods, a book (the first of many), and a mycologist, Jacques Van der Steen (1947-1991), who hosted mycological outings where I spent my holidays. The French Mycological Society saw me grow up, I met other fungi lovers, and I learned that knowledge is transmitted best via the heart (and with a touch of humor).<br/>As a university lecturer in the Lille Pharmacy Faculty, I mostly teach mycology and ecology to future pharmacists. My research is focused on the symbioses between fungi and plants, and the phylogeny and classification of Basidiomycota, with some side-trips into Ascomycota, such as this book.</p><p><i><strong>Pierre-Arthur MOREAU</strong></i></p><p> </p><p>Originally from the north of France, I arrived aged 2 in Noyon (in the Oise), home to Jean Calvin and Charlemagne, then studied in the Amiens Faculty of Pharmacy. After defending my pharmaceutical doctoral dissertation, I set up my pharmacy in Pont-l’Évêque (Oise) in 2001. Passionate about mycology since 1986, I studied under Marcel Bon, wrote numerous articles on my local fungi, and focused on morels. I authored the first worldwide classification of morels in 2012, and I travel around the Oise and beyond to record and photograph fungi. I also identify them every year at the annual Senlis mycological exhibition.</p><p>I am an ex-trumpet and handball player, an amateur of Gaulish and Roman coins – ultimately though, all my passions reconnect me to morels.</p><p><i><strong>Philippe CLOWEZ</strong></i></p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1608307775/wby1vtp7priavbueupbp.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>Philippe and Pierre-Arthur have contributed considerable improvements to the awareness of an unsuspected diversity among morels. Henceforth, it is entirely possible that, thanks to them, and the impact of this remarkable book, many ‘morel hunters’ may pay more attention to the actual identity of the specimens they had acquired for culinary purposes.</p><p>Their decisive work will permit the pursuit of scientific enrichment, through an improvement of the biogeographical, or even ecological understanding of these very particular mushrooms. Like any well-constructed monograph standing on solid foundations, it marks a new stage: the benefits of the knowledge collected here will quite probably act as a springboard for future discoveries and a new flourishing of morchellology, particularly in France and Europe.</p><p><strong>Professor <i>Régis COURTECUISSE</i>, University Professor</strong></p><p> </p><p>We have just published a book, a European and worldwide first, on the topic of ""Morels of  Europe"".</p><p>This reference book was written and illustrated by well-known specialists in this domain. <br/>The text and illustrations are all original and unpublished.<br/>The latest research on this fungus contained within is the result of several years of in-depth research.</p><p>This 374-page work is available to you as a subscription.It will be sent in sturdy packaging, individually wrapped in cellophane.</p><p>We attach to this message a selection of pages from this unique book, as well as a subscription warrant.

Every single aspect, from the text to the illustrations, paper, printing ink, or the cover, will delight both your senses and your mind.   To compile this monumental work on European morels, the authors worked tirelessly for several years.Using their combined experience in medecine, research, university lecturing, mycology, and illustration, they have created a masterpiece which collects all the most up-to-date knowledge on this well-known mushroom.Fuelled by their passion for this extraordinary mushroom, they set out to share their knowledge with clarity, method and concision.  You will be able to discover in this beautiful book, documented, illustrated which treats at the same time the history, the origin of morels, but also all the kinds of existing morels, the secret of the growth and the description of their anatomy.   When you open this breathtaking book of scholarship, you will be able to admire the representation of morels in the visual arts, the place of morels in Western literature. You will also learn how to try to tame its culture, if you have difficulty finding it in your region.     The mission of our publishing house is to share knowledge, culture, and art. For over 16 years, we have brought together authors to share their experience and insights on specific themes.In these troubled times of pandemics and uncertainty, and despite all of our efforts,  we are facing the same financial difficulties that menace the publishing sector as a whole. On top of this, large-scale distributors, agents, and online sales platforms (especially one well-known global website) are asking for a larger share of profits than ever. All these factors have made it necessary for us to ask for support from you, who values the preservation and sharing of books, reading, and culture.This kind of book is costly to put together. The money you donate will be used to cover technical costs, and any remaining funds will be directed to the authors, translators, illustrators and others who worked hard to bring this book to life.  I “caught” mycology when I was twelve. A few mushrooms spotted in the woods, a book (the first of many), and a mycologist, Jacques Van der Steen (1947-1991), who hosted mycological outings where I spent my holidays. The French Mycological Society saw me grow up, I met other fungi lovers, and I learned that knowledge is transmitted best via the heart (and with a touch of humor).As a university lecturer in the Lille Pharmacy Faculty, I mostly teach mycology and ecology to future pharmacists. My research is focused on the symbioses between fungi and plants, and the phylogeny and classification of Basidiomycota, with some side-trips into Ascomycota, such as this book.Pierre-Arthur MOREAU Originally from the north of France, I arrived aged 2 in Noyon (in the Oise), home to Jean Calvin and Charlemagne, then studied in the Amiens Faculty of Pharmacy. After defending my pharmaceutical doctoral dissertation, I set up my pharmacy in Pont-l’Évêque (Oise) in 2001. Passionate about mycology since 1986, I studied under Marcel Bon, wrote numerous articles on my local fungi, and focused on morels. I authored the first worldwide classification of morels in 2012, and I travel around the Oise and beyond to record and photograph fungi. I also identify them every year at the annual Senlis mycological exhibition.I am an ex-trumpet and handball player, an amateur of Gaulish and Roman coins – ultimately though, all my passions reconnect me to morels.Philippe CLOWEZ  Philippe and Pierre-Arthur have contributed considerable improvements to the awareness of an unsuspected diversity among morels. Henceforth, it is entirely possible that, thanks to them, and the impact of this remarkable book, many ‘morel hunters’ may pay more attention to the actual identity of the specimens they had acquired for culinary purposes.Their decisive work will permit the pursuit of scientific enrichment, through an improvement of the biogeographical, or even ecological understanding of these very particular mushrooms. Like any well-constructed monograph standing on solid foundations, it marks a new stage: the benefits of the knowledge collected here will quite probably act as a springboard for future discoveries and a new flourishing of morchellology, particularly in France and Europe.Professor Régis COURTECUISSE, University Professor We have just published a book, a European and worldwide first, on the topic of ""Morels of  Europe"".This reference book was written and illustrated by well-known specialists in this domain. The text and illustrations are all original and unpublished.The latest research on this fungus contained within is the result of several years of in-depth research.This 374-page work is available to you as a subscription.It will be sent in sturdy packaging, individually wrapped in cellophane.We attach to this message a selection of pages from this unique book, as well as a subscription warrant. Thank you for supporting the work of these passionate researchers.We thank you for your time, and look forward to your reply. Benoît ROLAND, Editor

<h3><strong>About the Project </strong></h3>
<p>The August 4th explosion destroyed much of our beloved Beirut. It killed 210 of our loved ones, injured at least 7,500 of them, damaged or destroyed 77,000 of our homes and businesses, displaced 300,000 of us, and emotionally devastated millions of us.</p>
<p>Hello everyone. My name is Zeina. I'm a Lebanese-American who has lived in Beirut for the past 10 years.</p>
<p>Like so many others, the explosion on August 4th crushed me. Everything turned dark. Days and nights were full of pain. Full of tears.</p>
<p>One month after the explosion, on one of the rare days that I got myself out of the house, I ran into an old friend of mine, Angelique, at a farmer’s market. She was sitting with a guy named Elyah. I thought they were lifelong friends, only to discover the surprising story of how they met:</p>
<p>When the explosion happened, Angelique was sitting in Sip Cafe on Gemmayze Street. The blast tore right through the coffee shop. She was badly injured and was struggling to find her way to the hospital amidst the horrific scenes in front of her. Strangers came to her aid along the way.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616180572/xuujqax8nyhzjjfli3oo.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>Sip Cafe After the Explosion; Photo Credit: Omar Jheir</i></p>
<p>What she didn’t know was that around the same time, Elyah had stumbled upon her purse in the debris. He took it and kept it safe for her, even though he had no idea who she was. Later that night, he got the courage to open up her purse, found her name, posted it on Instagram, and asked if anyone knew anything about her.  </p>
<p>Days later, he found her, and returned her purse. And there I was, one month later, witness to their new, growing friendship.</p>
<p>After hearing Angelique’s story, I realized the importance of recognizing the extraordinary things that ordinary people did (and continue to do) during this time of tragedy; to honor the lives that were lost and those that were left behind in their wake; to come to terms with the very real pain that still haunts us today, while being aware of the solidarity and support that emerged during one of the most devastating times of our lives.</p>
<p>And that’s when I decided I wanted to create a collection of stories that emerged in the aftermath of the Beirut Explosion. I teamed up with veteran writers Nadia Tabbara and Romy Lynn to guide the process of curating, coaching, and bringing together this book to its final stages –– a book that reflects true events with real people whose experiences deserve to be documented and never forgotten. </p>
<p>Will history tell the many stories of our trauma, our pain, and our deep, personal losses? We must find ways to keep these stories alive - because by remembering these stories, we remember what could happen when corruption, lack of accountability, and lack of transparency take hold of a country. August 4th is the heartbreaking outcome for those of us in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Once published, 100% of the profits from book sales will be donated to NGOs supporting families devastated by the Beirut Explosion.</p>
<p>The selection of these NGOs will be made in a transparent manner in partnership with <a href=""https://www.3qa.co/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">3QA</a>, a <a href=""https://www.3qa.co/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">social enterprise based in Lebanon</a> specialized in organizational assessments. A dedicated 3QA committee will assist us in conducting the due diligence and review of funding applications submitted by NGOs, to then propose a final selection and ensure oversight of funding.</p>
<h3><strong>About the Stories</strong></h3>
<p>I’ve been collecting testimonials since October 2020 and now have 25 stories to share with you. Although they are only a small fraction of the voices and experiences that deserve to be heard, they represent the courage and selflessness exhibited by thousands of people.</p>
<p>While the people of Lebanon are still mourning, and while true healing can never take place without justice, (something we must continue to fight for), every story you read will bring to life the true spirit of the human condition and our collective drive to protect and to support.</p>
<p>This book will be called ""We Were There"". Here are some of the stories you will read about:</p>
<ul>
<li>A missing woman in a coma with no family in Lebanon, found by a stranger who stayed by her side to support her throughout her entire traumatic journey and recovery</li>
<li>A young man who rushed to Beirut from Akkar, sleeping on the streets for several days with no money and nowhere to go, insisting to stay to help</li>
<li>A young lady who developed a mental health hotline and stayed awake during the nights out of fear of missing a single urgent call </li>
<li>A young expat living in the Ivory Coast who built an online platform to locate missing people</li>
<li>A wedding planner turned relief-reconstruction-rescue worker</li>
<li>A lonely, elderly man who found a community of support after the explosion</li>
<li>A Palestinian Civil Defense volunteer who, despite resistance from authorities, found a way for him and his peers to provide support and save lives</li>
<li>And so many more....</li>
</ul>
<p>I can continue to tell you about the many other stories in this book, but will leave it for other voices to share.</p>
<p>By preserving these stories, we spread the experience to thousands more –– a powerful form of nonviolent action –– with the hope that this book may ultimately become an archive and a tool of resistance.</p>
<h3><strong>Progress to Date &amp; Next Steps</strong></h3>
<p>Over the past few months, I have been working closely with Nadia Tabbara, Romy Lynn, Niamh Fleming-Farrell, and Jasmina Najjar - all of whom have been guiding, advising, and supporting the development of this project. Together, we have formed an incredible team of over 20 professional writers who are now also involved in this book project.</p>
<p>We are aiming to follow this timeline going forward:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1617298141/lwodn9ykawem3vglfyo8.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>After this initial book printing for this crowdfunding campaign, we will aim to get the book further published and distributed through bookstores and online in Lebanon and abroad to increase awareness of these stories, and to raise additional funds for NGOs supporting families affected by the blast.</p>
<p>Basic book production and publication costs are estimated at around $11,000, covering: </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Writers</strong> <i>(these are skilled writers who are each matched with a story contributor to produce a well-written story reflecting the true experience of the contributor)</i></p></li>

<p>Variable Costs depending on number of books ordered and funds available:</p>

<li><p><strong>Printing</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Marketing &amp; Promotion </strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>As project curator, I’m fully volunteering my time and not receiving any compensation for this project. </p>
<p>As noted above, beyond the core costs, all additional funds raised via this crowdfunding campaign and later sales of the book will be donated to local NGOs working on post-blast relief and recovery, in collaboration with 3QA.</p>

Thank you for your support!Uncolonized Latinas is about breaking free from the limiting cultural narratives that have kept us from achieving extraordinary success.Many of us, immigrant Latinas and daughters of immigrants, are first generation to get a college degree, to pursue a corporate career, or to open a business, and we feel we are figuring it all out by ourselves, as nobody at home can provide us with guidance or a roadmap. We are trailblazers, going after goals no other female in our families had access to. And in these new spaces, we may feel different, and sometimes, lonely.At the same time, we struggle with our cultural narratives. So many of us have been feeling less, or not as good, or we think we need to change who we are to succeed. We tend to think we need to do it all, by ourselves, as we support multiple generations in our families. And many times, we work very hard hoping somebody will notice, not asking for what we need.  We stay silent, and that silence is cultural.These times are calling us Latinas to think about ourselves in a new way, and to unite and work collectively as we embrace the unprecedented opportunities that were not available to our female ancestors, but that are opening up for us.Our non-Hispanic allies are also being called to manage and mentor diverse talent in a new way, in which an in-depth understanding of the Latino culture and of the particular barriers to success that Latinas face, become a huge plus to be an effective leader or mentor.In this book, Valeria Aloe hopes to instill in you the same passion and excitement that she has for Latinas, envisioning our community as the future of the United States and all of the Americas, as we confidently go after bigger and better opportunities. 
Embrace our collective greatness, as we honor our stories and where we come from.
Become more aware of the limiting cultural narratives that have been running us, many times unconsciously.
Strategize how to better support your career or business, learning from those Latinas who figured out how to navigate the system.
Feel motivated, as a Latina, to take action to thrive in your career and life from a place of self-love and self-esteem. As an ally, feel more confident and become more effective when leading and mentoring diverse talent.
You will love this book if you are a Latina professional or business owner who wants to succeed, but feels you have not reached your maximum potential yet, if you feel alone or not understood in your journey, or if you are frustrated with systemic bias and competition within our Hispanic community and beyond.Also, if you are an ally who wants to support our Latinas succeed, from a place of understanding where we come from, and how can team up to create bigger and better results together.The book is written in 4 parts:Part 1: Where we come from: Introduction + Chapters 1-4.A look into how colonization and immigration shaped our mindsets, how this influences our thoughts and decisions, and how immigration trauma does not stop with the migrant generation, but impacts its descendants. We will also take a deep dive into the “Hispanic Paradox”: we are great contributors to the US economy and culture, but we have not embraced our power yet.Part 2: How a colonized mindset shows up: Chapters 5-11.You will have an opportunity to explore the limiting cultural narratives and specific behaviors that keep you from achieving extraordinary success (feeling unworthy or inferior, feeling that you do not have a voice, feeling unsafe in positions of visibility, etc) and you will gain insights into moving past those limiting narratives as you learn from the experiences of Latinas that look and sound like you.Part 3: How systemic bias and our own colorism act as magnifiers: Chapters 12-14.Understand the external factors that amplify your inner limiting voices creating a perfect storm that keeps you away from manifesting great success, including widespread systemic bias, micro-aggressions, division and competition among Hispanics, and colorism within our community.Part 4: How to build a new collective, starting with YOU: Chapters 15-19.Explore practical strategies that will support you in embracing your uncolonized inner essence, in finding your voice, and in showing up as your authentic self. You will also gain insights into accessing and navigating the system, through education, personal brand building, networking, mentoring, and more, as you learn from what has worked for other Latinas who have trailblazed new spaces.If you pre-order the book now, you will be jumping into an EXPERIENCE and a MOVEMENT. You will join the author in an experience, as an insider of her publishing journey:
You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish (shipping within the U.S. is included), a handwritten thank-you note, and tickets to my Virtual Launch Party.
Your name will appear in the Acknowledgments section of the book (“with Special Thanks to”).
You will receive early access to the Introduction and some excerpts from the book, with the opportunity to review it and provide early feedback.
You will have the opportunity to be involved in selecting the cover and title.
You will be invited to join the Author Community and get behind-the-scenes sneak peeks into the publishing process.
Depending on the package you choose, you can get tickets to the exclusive 3-part “Cultural Narratives” workshop series, where you will challenge how you have been viewing your life, create action steps to better support your career or business, and connect with other supporters. Or, you can have a private ""Mindset Breakthrough"" session with the author and get a 60-day mindset journal.
And much more! (For custom-built Workshops + Book bundles for your organization or community, contact the author at valeria@abundanciaconsciente.net. Curriculum: Young Leadership, Emotional Intelligence, Stress Management, Diverse Talent Managerial Training, Hybrid Workspace Best Practices).
And you will become part of a movement by supporting emerging Latina voices, currently making up for less than 5% of the publishing industry. This movement not only gives visibility to our stories, it creates a platform for Latinas to increasingly step into new spaces of leadership and influence. This book will be published with New Degree Press, and pre-order tiers were set up to help cover the costs of publishing it. Money raised will go towards the following:

The Editor who will revise and publish the manuscript in January 2022.

The Cover Design for the book. (The mockups you see currently are a placeholder!)

The Layout Design for the interior of the book (physical copy, ebook formats).

The Copyediting for the book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.

The Launch & Promotion Efforts for the book when it ultimately publishes this Winter.

The Spanish Translation, to also reach our Spanish-speaking Latinas!

Since 2016, she dedicated her career to support immigrants and women of color confidently go after bigger and better opportunities, and has coached and worked closely with more than 400 diverse entrepreneurs and corporate professionals.

<h2><strong>About This Project</strong></h2>
<p>This project will fund an anthology titled <strong>THERE IS NO DEATH, THERE ARE NO DEAD</strong> containing approximately 12 short stories from some of today’s biggest names in dark fantasy and horror fiction. The book will be edited by Aaron J. French and Jess Landry, and published by Crystal Lake Publishing in August 2021.</p>

<h2><strong>The Spirits Of The Dead Exist And They Want To Communicate</strong></h2>
<p>First appearing in the late 1800s, spiritualism became a religious movement that swept the world. Under the assumption that the dead live on in the afterlife, spiritualists believed that contact with the dearly departed was not only possible, but something those who crossed over longed for. Contact was usually made through a medium, a person who claimed to have the ability to speak with the dead.</p>
<p>In a time of uncertainty, women in the movement were given a voice. Most notably, the Fox sisters became the faces of spiritualism—young, innocent, and cunning. As the popularity of the religion grew (along with the skepticism), the sisters and others like them swindled believers out of their hard-earned money, ultimately causing spiritualism to come crashing down around all those who claimed to have psychic abilities. However, there are still some who follow the movement to this day, driven by their belief that they can, in fact, communicate with the dead.</p>
<p>Featuring a mix of stories set in modern and olden times, <strong>THERE IS NO DEATH, THERE ARE NO DEAD</strong> tackles all aspects of the spiritualist movement: from the true believers to the nay-sayers, the hoaxes to hauntings, the real mediums to the scam artists. Edited by Aaron J. French and Jess Landry, and published by Crystal Lake Publishing in 2021. Authors include:</p>

<p>In order to fund this project, our goal is to raise $5,000. Backers of this project will be generating the base funds needed to produce this anthology, including payment for the contributing authors, payment for the cover artist, and production costs for producing the anthology. The reward levels are therefore calculated with respect to the cost of the final product when it goes on sale to the general public. In this sense, most backers of the project will be “preordering” the anthology, though often with an added advantage, which will help fund the paperback edition of the book. However, certain backers who choose a higher level of reward will help support the project at the paperback level as well as receive more substantial incentives, like additional books from Crystal Lake Publishing or editing services from Aaron J. French, Jess Landry, Crystal Lake Publishing owner Joe Mynhardt, and anthology contributor Lee Murray.</p>
<p>We promise to curate only the most powerful and original fiction for this project, only stories that truly capture the theme of spiritualism and communication with the dead. The publisher, Crystal Lake Publishing, is one of the top producers of speculative fiction, with many years of solid experience under their belt. The cover art will be provided by the very talented Jana Heidersdorf, whose dark vision and spectral style beautifully matches the tone of the project.  We are confident that together we can produce a book that is totally unique as well as spookily satisfying.</p>
<p><strong>But we need your help. </strong>We can’t make this project a reality without your support. Please consider backing our INDIEGOGO campaign and help spread the word. With your support, we can make this book a success. Thank you!<br/> </p>

<p><strong>Aaron J. French</strong> has a long track-record as a successful editor, with many years of experience working with NY Times bestselling authors and well-known figures in the film and art worlds. He is best known for editing several popular anthologies that include <i>The Gods of H.P. Lovecraft, The Demons of King Solomon, Songs of the Satyrs</i>, and the <i>Monk Punk &amp; Shadow of the Unknown Omnibus.</i> </p>
<p>In addition to his editing skills, Aaron brings to the project his scholarly background in the study of esotericism and magic and his many connections with both academic and practitioners in this field. As a current doctoral student in The Study of Religion, Aaron collaborates on research projects and articles dealing with the topic of the occult in history, spiritualism, and alternative religious movements. This experience will bolster the project’s realness and authenticity. In other words, this anthology will not only be a top-notch collection of unique speculative fiction, but also a serious meditation on the existence of spirits and the potential for still-living human beings to connect with them.  </p>

<h2><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h2>
<p>As with the production of any book, there are many logistical challenges and deadlines involved in its successful appearance on the market. This can include unexpected delays in the delivery of stories from authors, or in the editing and the printing processes, etc. However, we are confident that with the editors’ years of professional experience in dealing with such issues, as well as the stellar track-record of the publisher, such issues (should they arise) will not be a problem. We promise to make every effort to have the book in the hands of backers by the scheduled release date of August 27, 2021. Due to the current situation of the global pandemic, there is always a slight chance certain complications could arise in response to this, or perhaps a confirmed author may have an emergency and need to drop out of the anthology. In the unlikely event this should occur, their slot would be filled with another high-level popular author we decide would best fit the opening. We feel very confident there will not be a delay or that a confirmed author will not deliver, but sometimes these things do happen. We therefore ask for your confidence and trust in our sense as editors and professionals to make the best decisions should this occur.</p>

This project will fund an anthology titled THERE IS NO DEATH, THERE ARE NO DEAD containing approximately 12 short stories from some of today’s biggest names in dark fantasy and horror fiction. The book will be edited by Aaron J. French and Jess Landry, and published by Crystal Lake Publishing in August 2021.
 

The Spirits Of The Dead Exist And They Want To Communicate
First appearing in the late 1800s, spiritualism became a religious movement that swept the world. Under the assumption that the dead live on in the afterlife, spiritualists believed that contact with the dearly departed was not only possible, but something those who crossed over longed for. Contact was usually made through a medium, a person who claimed to have the ability to speak with the dead.
In a time of uncertainty, women in the movement were given a voice. Most notably, the Fox sisters became the faces of spiritualism—young, innocent, and cunning. As the popularity of the religion grew (along with the skepticism), the sisters and others like them swindled believers out of their hard-earned money, ultimately causing spiritualism to come crashing down around all those who claimed to have psychic abilities. However, there are still some who follow the movement to this day, driven by their belief that they can, in fact, communicate with the dead.
Featuring a mix of stories set in modern and olden times, THERE IS NO DEATH, THERE ARE NO DEAD tackles all aspects of the spiritualist movement: from the true believers to the nay-sayers, the hoaxes to hauntings, the real mediums to the scam artists. Edited by Aaron J. French and Jess Landry, and published by Crystal Lake Publishing in 2021. Authors include:
Lisa Morton
Kathe Koja
Helen Marshall
Lee Murray
Gwendolyn Kiste
Gemma Files
SP Miskowski
Seanan McGuire
Laird Barron
David Demchuk
Nadia Bulkin
Chesya Burke
And more to be announced…

In order to fund this project, our goal is to raise $5,000. Backers of this project will be generating the base funds needed to produce this anthology, including payment for the contributing authors, payment for the cover artist, and production costs for producing the anthology. The reward levels are therefore calculated with respect to the cost of the final product when it goes on sale to the general public. In this sense, most backers of the project will be “preordering” the anthology, though often with an added advantage, which will help fund the paperback edition of the book. However, certain backers who choose a higher level of reward will help support the project at the paperback level as well as receive more substantial incentives, like additional books from Crystal Lake Publishing or editing services from Aaron J.

Editors

Aaron J. French has a long track-record as a successful editor, with many years of experience working with NY Times bestselling authors and well-known figures in the film and art worlds. He is best known for editing several popular anthologies that include The Gods of H.P. Lovecraft, The Demons of King Solomon, Songs of the Satyrs, and the Monk Punk & Shadow of the Unknown Omnibus. 
In addition to his editing skills, Aaron brings to the project his scholarly background in the study of esotericism and magic and his many connections with both academic and practitioners in this field. As a current doctoral student in The Study of Religion, Aaron collaborates on research projects and articles dealing with the topic of the occult in history, spiritualism, and alternative religious movements. This experience will bolster the project’s realness and authenticity. In other words, this anthology will not only be a top-notch collection of unique speculative fiction, but also a serious meditation on the existence of spirits and the potential for still-living human beings to connect with them.  

From the day she was born, Bram Stoker Award-winner Jess Landry has always been attracted to the darker things in life. Her fondest childhood memories include getting nightmares from the Goosebumps books, watching The Hilarious House of Frightenstein, and reiterating to her parents that there was absolutely nothing wrong with her mental state.
Since then, Jess’s fiction has appeared in many anthologies, including Tales of the Lost, Twice-Told: A Collection of Doubles, Monsters of Any Kind, Where Nightmares Come From, Lost Highways: Dark Fictions from the Road, and Fantastic Tales of Terror, among others. Her debut collection, The Mother Wound, is set for release in early 2021 from Independent Legions Publishing. Jess has been an editor for over seven years, editing everything from short stories to Bram Stoker Award-winning novels and collections.
Also working as a screenwriter, Jess’s debut feature, My Only Sunshine, a coming-of-age horror film, has been called “a sharp and precise slow-burn horror story” by the Black List and is currently in development. My Only Sunshine was also accepted into Whistler Film Festival’s prestigious Screenwriters Lab for the 2020 season. Jess has written several other screenplays, including A Secret to Keep, Breast Cancer Bucket List, Deadly Mom Retreat, and The Therapy Nightmares, all for MarVista Entertainment and Lifetime.

Cover Art
For the cover art, we’ll be using a piece by the enormously talented Jana Heidersdorf. However, if we reach our stretch goal, we will be commissioning a custom piece from her.

Her clients include Cemetery Dance Publications, Amazon Studios (""LORE""), ImagineFX, Titan Comics, DC/Vertigo, Fabulous App, Erthe & Axen Records, and Bottleneck Gallery.
 
Interior Art

Bonus! We are also commissioning an original necklace designed around the theme of the book, which backers at the $350 level will receive (the necklace itself is valued at $550). The piece is hand-crafted by Sofia's company, Sofia Zakia, a fine jewelry brand based out of Montréal that weaves the charm and elegance of outer space and mythology through the quiet intimacy of jewelry. Each piece from Zakia is a love letter to its inspiration and reflects a gracefully expressive story or symbol of our universe and history.

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p><i>Claim Your Worth Now</i> is a non-fiction book with a memoir &amp; self-help spin that provides weekly inspiration (similar to devotionals) to motivate readers to walk confidently into their self-worth. It also provides reflections and weekly to-dos that help readers accomplish their goals with intention.<br/><br/>My name is Toddchelle Young (pronouns: she/her/hers) and I am the author of <i>Claim Your Worth Now.</i> I wrote this book because I needed weekly inspiration to affirm my strengths and to lift my spirits to propel me forward towards my dreams. In a matter of weeks, I was able to discover keys to doors I didn’t know existed while opening ones that took a lifetime.<br/><br/>In reading this book, my hope is that you will discover intentional inspiration and understand why today's happiest and most successful people use the power of intention and purpose to drive their lives forward. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for conquering my dreams. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you find the strength and energy within yourself to accomplish every goal you set out to achieve.<br/><br/>In this book:</p>
<ul>
<li>You will receive weekly advice and lessons from doctors, entrepreneurs, professionals in public service, and more!</li>

<li>You will learn how I’ve navigated hardships by leaving my family to fulfill my educational goals, raising my brother while working full-time, and realizing my self-worth through academic failures and professional successes. Together, these experiences changed my approach to actualizing my dreams forever.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>

You will be guided to confront your past, diving into circumstances to help you understand how and why you arrived to where you are today.

You will focus in on the present, understanding your current habits, attitudes, and behaviors that may influence your motivation to move further than where you are. By intentionally embracing what inspires you today, you will directly impact the direction of your life. <br/><br/>Part 3 contains Weeks 36 through 52 + Conclusion.

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<i>The Entrepreneurial Learning Journey – and Back Again</i><br/><br/>Have you ever wondered why the entrepreneurial classroom seems so different from a more traditional classroom? Perhaps you are an educator, or you are one of the students who signed up for an entrepreneurial class. Whatever your situation, if you are driven by a constant curiosity about entrepreneurship in the classroom, then this book is for you.<br/><br/>My name is Birgitte Wraae, and I wrote this book because I am driven by a curiosity to find what makes entrepreneurship so special to teach. Students are leaving our classroom feeling more changed and more aware of their own skills and competencies than ever before — and no doubt, that is special.<br/><br/>This book explores the world of entrepreneurship education, more specifically the journey we are asking our students to take. I call it a hero’s journey because the students enter the classroom expecting more of the same, but instead, they get a call to action – to explore and return with something that creates value for someone.<br/><br/>My hope is to instill in you the same passion for entrepreneurship that I have. I want you to see this book as a guide to understand the possibilities that entrepreneurship offers and use them on your own learning journey, whatever that may be.<br/><br/>In this book you will be taken on the entrepreneurial learning journey. It is an inspirational book based on my own experiences and conversations with experienced entrepreneurship educators around the world, you will learn about:<p>The importance of setting the scene and getting to know your students</p>
<p>Insights from experienced educators on the why, the how and the what of teaching entrepreneurship</p>
<p>The challenges students are facing</p>
<p>The role of the entrepreneurship educator</p>
<p>Personal reflections from students</p>
<p>What’s next for students returning to their own world</p>
<p><br/><i>The Entrepreneurial Learning Journey – and Back Again</i> is a nonfiction book. You will love this book if you love to teach, no matter the subject you are teaching, and are a curious educator on your own learning path. You will also enjoy it if you are a student entrepreneur wanting to understand the process, or if you are working within education and want to understand the possibilities that entrepreneurship offers.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The Book - <i>The Entrepreneurial Learning Journey - and Back Again</i></strong></h3>The book is written in six parts.<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the first two chapters where I explore the purpose of entrepreneurship education and the personal development that is a part of the purpose.<br/><br/>Part 2 contains chapters 3-5, where we meet the students in the known world of education. It discusses the importance of getting to know the students and the concept of entrepreneurial learning.<br/><br/>Part 3 contains chapters 6-9 that zooms into the unknown world of entrepreneurship. I start with introducing the general understanding of entrepreneurship and move on to discuss which entrepreneurial competencies are needed, and how to foster a growth mindset. It is also here the students meet the abyss in the form of the emotional roller coaster.<br/><br/>Part 4 contains chapters 10-11, and focuses on the role of the entrepreneurship educator. Being an educator means taking on different roles to assist the students in reaching their goals.<br/><br/>Part 5 contains chapters 12-14 and forms a discussion around how we assess the students when they have reached the goal set for the course. The entrepreneurial learning journey also includes a change in the students’ mindset and their identity. How do we measure that?<br/><br/>Part 6 closes the journey with chapters 15-17 that discuss overall themes with entrepreneurship education including the dark sides as well as the future of the field.<br/><br/>All parts include personal reflections from students who have participated in an entrepreneurial course or programme.<br/><br/> <h2>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h2>

About the Author
Mallory Herrin, SPHR, SHRM-CP, CPLC is the founder and Principal HR Consultant of HerrinHR, a full service Human Resources Consultancy located in Dallas, TX. She wrote this book because she has a passion for HR and helping other HR professionals to take their work to the next level.Throughout her career, Mallory has often seen HR professionals relegated to paper processing and compliance related activities and knows how detrimental this becomes to an HR professional’s growth, and the companies they work for. She’s also seen the positive impact to the businesses she’s worked with as a consultant when HR is valued as a strategic function. She wanted to write this book to explore why this isn’t the case in every organization and how to overcome the misconception of HR as purely tactical.Mallory isn’t just an HR professional, she’s also a wife, mother to two children, and a dog mom. She volunteers for several organizations, including Goodwill Industries of Dallas, Dallas CASA, DallasHR, Kinetic-Her, and more. In her almost non-existent spare time she enjoys local live music, seeing friends, and taking naps.For more information, you can connect with Mallory Herrin at mallory@herrinhr.com and on LinkedIn.

 
International Preorders
For international pre-orders, please do the following:
Identify the perk that interests you, e.g. 1 or 2 paperbacks
Select the pink ""Back it"" button to ""Make a contribution"" for the same amount (this choice bypasses the shipping address page)
Use this form to share your mailing address, so I can calculate the international shipping costs and invoice you for that amount via PayPal/Venmo
Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies are expected to ship.

Other Ways You Can Help
Not everyone can support, but that doesn't mean you can't get something out of it!I will reward the top 3 people who refer the most backers at the end of the campaign (30 days). Here's how:

At the top of the campaign page, you will see the ""share"" buttons. Click on the ""chain"" icon to get a custom link for just for you. (Note: don't use the URL in the browser window as it won't work to track referrals and you won't get credit.)
Copy that link and paste it on your social media, email it to a friend, or text a fellow book lover.
When someone clicks on that link and backs the book, you get 1 entry!

<br/><br/>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><i>The Next Gold Rush: How Cryptocurrency Will Change Everything</i> is about the power of blockchain technology and its potential to impact every part of society. Cryptocurrency is the next evolution of the internet and my book will help you understand the power of this financial revolution.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>My name is Ethan Turer and I am the author of <i>The Next Gold Rush</i>. I wrote this book because of my idea for a new cryptocurrency that can transform how people interact with one another. I want to inspire my readers about the future of cryptocurrency while educating them with interesting stories and research.<br/><br/>I hope that by reading my book you will discover what cryptocurrency is and how it will transform the world. In this book, I strive to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for cryptocurrency and the blockchain technology that powers it. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you begin your journey into the crypto space.<br/><br/>In this book, you will learn about the rise of Bitcoin and Ethereum and other stories of crypto change-makers. You'll hear stories such as...</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Satoshi Nakamoto</strong> is an alias for a person (or group of people) whose identity we have yet to figure out. This alias is responsible for the <strong>Bitcoin</strong> whitepaper and its subsequent release in 2009. Bitcoin is the world’s first cryptocurrency and it was made possible because of a mysterious alias named Satoshi Nakamoto. In some ways, Satoshi's elusivity is the perfect symbol for a decentralized technology that needs no central authority or figure.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>J.R. Willett</strong> is the inventor of the <strong>Initial Coin Offering (ICO)</strong>. In my book, I outline my interview with him and explain why he felt compelled to make his idea a reality when no one else would. J.R. is also credited with being the creator of the stable coin which allows some cryptocurrency prices to remain “stable” while others experience volatility.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Taylor Swift</strong>’s tremendous success in the music industry, even without a record label, showcases the need of cryptocurrency for influencers that challenge the status quo. I discuss the idea of having your own <strong>personal coin</strong> in my book. If Taylor Swift had her own currency, then fans could invest in her coin and reap the benefits of her continued success.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>If you are curious about this “new internet money” and why it’s increased in price to almost $60,000, you will love this book! Or maybe you know about Bitcoin but you want to be inspired about the next evolution of cryptocurrency!<br/> </p>

Any books, programs or other play stimulus that challenges this and portrays princesses as agents of action with exciting and interesting storylines is to be embraced and welcomed and is good for our children's development.  The Not Just a Princess series is based on challenging the Princess stereotype and puts the Princess front and centre of their own story.

<h3>Story of <i>A Girl Named Ellie</i>
</h3>
<p>My name is MaryBeth Edmundson, and I am the author of A Girl Named Ellie. I wrote this book because I hope to be a full-time author. I have loved stories since I can remember... anything with a plot line was — and is — my favorite thing in the world. This story has been with me since I was in high school, and I think it’s time to share this story. My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that sometimes it’s okay to fall and get back up. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to grow with my main character and to see challenges from a different perspective. <br/><br/>A Girl Named Ellie speaks to teenagers and young adults who want to understand self-confidence and coming to terms with anxiety... all with the grace and poise of a figure skater.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that A Girl Named Ellie inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do all types of anxiety impact everyone differently?</li>
<li>Really, how difficult is figure skating?</li>
<li>Is it possible that the way we interact with people we trust can help us better know ourselves?</li>
</ul>
<p>I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers!</p>
</div><div>

<h3>Child of Invention.</h3>
<p>My name is Luz Emma Cañas Madrigal. I am a Sufi poet, healer, martial artist, and yogi. I have had my own businesses since I was 21. Partially out of necessity but mainly because I was single mother who wasn't willing to sacrifice time away from my cubs and also out of my need for independence. I have built and lost businesses small and large. And have had multiple ideas stolen by big corporations, including American Apparel. Their whole concept was mine. Yup, you can read about it in my memoir! With every curve ball thrown at me in life and business, I have used them as opportunities to adapt and reinvent myself. I have lived multiple lives as a therapist, a fashion designer, a filmmaker, a writer, and a teaching artist. My latest venture is as an indie publisher which allows me to explore all of these elements through books. And ultimately films. </p>
<p>There is no secret that there is a great deal of elitism and gatekeeping in the publishing world that shuts Black authors out. Even more so for diasporic authors that occupy multiple margins; immigrant, first gen, polyglot, queer, trans, disabled, or mentally ill. And these stories have notoriously stolen, bit and adapted by entities with more money and power making their way into books and films all the while leaving out those that lived them. </p>
<h3>Goal.</h3>
<p>It is my vision to establish a Black centered publishing house that will allow authors to maintain control of their creative property and see their stories develop from book to screen. Starting with the production of two books, noir novel by Christopher Taylor and a memoir by me, Luz Emma Cañas. Having been involved in the production of my recently published poetry book, from him to Him, by Maximalist Press, I have learned that equity in practice is very different that equity as an idea. In order to pay all people involved in production a fair wage, things tend to cost more from the author, to designers to printers. Another factor that raises the price is how the book is crafted and its rarity. Martial Love and Blue Eyed Dog are a short run press of 100 books. Only 60 will be sold. Some will be for promotions and others will be placed in the vault. Although I did raise some money from the sales of from him to Him, I didn't make enough for the production of  TWO books. </p>
<h3>How you can support. </h3>
<p>To raise this money, I will be selling incentives from $1-$108. All items related to the art of story- telling and produced by me. I've got art house short films at the low end to a limited edition embossed soft cover at the high end for $108. Feel free to donate just cuz because you believe that stories outside of the mainstream deserve to be told. If you have been following me, you know that I produce quality products with little resources. Imagine what I could do with more!

</div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","Child of Invention.
My name is Luz Emma Cañas Madrigal. I am a Sufi poet, healer, martial artist, and yogi. I have had my own businesses since I was 21. Partially out of necessity but mainly because I was single mother who wasn't willing to sacrifice time away from my cubs and also out of my need for independence. I have built and lost businesses small and large. And have had multiple ideas stolen by big corporations, including American Apparel. Their whole concept was mine. Yup, you can read about it in my memoir! With every curve ball thrown at me in life and business, I have used them as opportunities to adapt and reinvent myself. I have lived multiple lives as a therapist, a fashion designer, a filmmaker, a writer, and a teaching artist. My latest venture is as an indie publisher which allows me to explore all of these elements through books. And ultimately films. 
There is no secret that there is a great deal of elitism and gatekeeping in the publishing world that shuts Black authors out. Even more so for diasporic authors that occupy multiple margins; immigrant, first gen, polyglot, queer, trans, disabled, or mentally ill. And these stories have notoriously stolen, bit and adapted by entities with more money and power making their way into books and films all the while leaving out those that lived them. 
Goal.
It is my vision to establish a Black centered publishing house that will allow authors to maintain control of their creative property and see their stories develop from book to screen. Starting with the production of two books, noir novel by Christopher Taylor and a memoir by me, Luz Emma Cañas. Having been involved in the production of my recently published poetry book, from him to Him, by Maximalist Press, I have learned that equity in practice is very different that equity as an idea. In order to pay all people involved in production a fair wage, things tend to cost more from the author, to designers to printers. Another factor that raises the price is how the book is crafted and its rarity. Martial Love and Blue Eyed Dog are a short run press of 100 books. Only 60 will be sold. Some will be for promotions and others will be placed in the vault. Although I did raise some money from the sales of from him to Him, I didn't make enough for the production of  TWO books. 
How you can support. 
To raise this money, I will be selling incentives from $1-$108. All items related to the art of story- telling and produced by me. I've got art house short films at the low end to a limited edition embossed soft cover at the high end for $108. Feel free to donate just cuz because you believe that stories outside of the mainstream deserve to be told. If you have been following me, you know that I produce quality products with little resources. Imagine what I could do with more! I don't usually ask for handouts but my 50th birthday is coming up so why not?!
In the event that I don't meet my goal, the monies we do receive will go to printing which is the part of production that requires the most amount of money. Printing alone costs $3k per book. For two books, Martial Love and Blue Eyed Dog, I need a minimum of $6k.
Help me tell these and other stories. Buy my stuff! Follow the campaign! Contribute any amount. Spread the word by sharing on social media and among your friends and colleagues. Sharing costs nothing. Thanks in advance for your continued support.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><br/>In light of recent events in Afghanistan, I decided that a story should be told about a time when there was a sense of optimism in the country. Those years of optimism began when the Socialist Revolution occurred in April 1978. The socialist struggle would continue after the Soviets intervened in December 1979 to help the Afghans protect their revolution, but the war would make that optimism wither away, therefore I consider the golden age of Socialist Afghanistan to have ended in December 1979. <br/> </p>

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><i>Adrift in Search of Camellias</i> is a science-fiction novel about VR, neurotechnology, and finding purpose despite failure. It explores themes of complacency, honesty to oneself, and self-discovery. It is set in the near future in Central City, a government that has risen from the ashes of a fallen nation.</p>
<p>My name is Justin Cho and I am the author of <i>Adrift in Search of Camellias</i>. I wrote this book to because I wanted to create something that was an authentic representation of myself. After many emotional lows in my life, I realized how important it was for me to be creative. I took the lessons and energy that I gained from these experiences to create a novel that embodies myself through subject matters that interest me and a story that thematically reflects my own experiences.</p>
<p>My hope with this novel is that it encourages people to think about the true reasons behind their actions and whether what they’re doing is right for them. It is a question that points inward, and one that can help people better understand themselves and the people around them.</p>
<p>My novel is set in the near future, where many of the currently emerging technologies have been realized such as self-driving cars and brain chips. I chose to particularly focus on VR, neurotechnology, and big data algorithms. In this future, sports have developed to gradually become more reliant on technology, and many sports are even played completely online in a virtual reality space. The protagonist is a player of one of these VR sports, but he is stuck in an emotional low. Despite his efforts, he finds himself constantly falling short of his goals, and despite advice that he should quit, he can’t bring himself to do so. This novel is about his journey, finding the confidence to continue, and coming to a deeper understanding of himself.</p>
<p>You will love this book if you are interested in new, upcoming technologies or if you resonate with the emotional journey of the protagonist.</p>
<p><i>Adrift in Search of Camellias</i> speaks to students and young adults who want to grapple with self-acceptance and finding purpose in a new way.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I hope that <i>Adrift in Search of Camellias</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why do we do the things that we do?</li>
<li>Are we doing things for ourselves or for what we think others want us to do?</li>
<li>What makes something worth committing to?</li>
</ul>
<p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers.</p>

<p><strong>*** Book available in English and Italian | <i>Libro disponibile in inglese e italiano</i> ***</strong></p>
<p>Extinguished Countries is the first guidebook series to countries that no longer exist. We don’t follow today’s borders but take you on a journey through time and space to lost kingdoms, republics and empires, looking for what unites us rather than divides us. It's a time machine for travellers! Our first guidebook is about the Republic of Venice but many others will follow (Austro-Hungarian Empire, Ottoman Empire...).</p>
<p><i>Extinguished Countries è la prima serie di guide dedicate a paesi che non esistono più. Non seguiamo i confini di oggi, ma ti portiamo in viaggio nel tempo e nello spazio verso regni, repubbliche e imperi perduti, cercando ciò che ci unisce piuttosto che ciò che ci divide. È una macchina del tempo per viaggiatori! La nostra prima guida è sulla Serenissima ma molte altre seguiranno (Impero austro-ungarico, Impero ottomano...).</i></p>
<p>Here's the video in Italian | <i>Qui il video in italiano</i> :</p>

<p>The world as we know it today has changed many times throughout history. Take an old map from 100 or 200 years ago and try to point to some of your familiar places. Found yourself in trouble? Maybe they have a new name, or they're divided by a border that today no longer exists. That's the evolution of history: the state we live in succeeded an ancestor from the past, the language we speak has long and intricate roots, and even our identity is a combination of diverse influences. Extinguished Countries dives into all this!</p>
<p><i>Il mondo non è sempre stato come lo conosciamo oggi. Basta dare un’occhiata ad una cartina vecchia di 100 o 200 anni e si fa già fatica a riconoscere i luoghi più familiari, magari perché indicati con un altro nome, o perché separati da qualche confine oggi inesistente. È l'evoluzione della storia. Lo Stato in cui viviamo nasce da un antenato del passato, la lingua che parliamo ha radici lunghe e intricate e persino la nostra identità è una combinazione di diverse influenze. Le guide degli Stati scomparsi si immergono in tutto questo!</i></p>
<h2>Why is this important | <i>Perché è importante</i>
</h2>
<p>At a time when Europe is experiencing resurgent nationalism, the Extinguished Countries guidebooks show that throughout history countries change and leave behind composite and stratified cultural legacies. As a result, today we have many things in common, not only with our neighbours, but also with people that might live far away but were once connected to us. There are legends, traditions, dishes that we share from our common past, and that bring us closer rather than farther apart.</p>
<p><i>In un momento in cui l'Europa vive un ritorno dei nazionalismi, le guide degli Stati scomparsi mostrano che nel corso della storia i paesi cambiano e lasciano dietro a sé delle eredità culturali composite e stratificate. Al punto che oggi, abbiamo molte cose in comune, non solo con i nostri vicini di casa ma anche con persone che abitano magari lontano da noi, ma a cui un tempo eravamo legati. Ci sono leggende, tradizioni, piatti che condividiamo dal nostro passato comune e che ci avvicinano agli altri piuttosto che separarci.</i></p>
<p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1585489528/hget7ianbo6x8wqgu0u5.jpg"" src=""""/></i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Brudet/Brodetto (a fish stew) connecting people :-)</p>
<p>This is not a nostalgic or revisionist journey. Even if our guides play the game of imagining that a former country still exists, their objective is not to celebrate defunct political realities. On the contrary: by interviewing people from Venice to Cyprus, we show different perspectives. Also, our guidebooks introduce a new way of travelling. You’ll be walking on today’s streets, but at the same time travelling back in time, following maps and itineraries from the past. It's a sort of augmented reality that allows you to hop on and off from the present into the past.  </p>

<h2>The Republic of Venice | <i>La Repubblica di Venezia</i>
</h2>
<p>The Republic of Venice was a 1000-year old state that disappeared in 1797. It's a story of maritime routes, spice trade and naval battles all over Middle Ages and Renaissance period. Geographically, it encompassed territories that today are part of Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Montenegro, Albania, Greece and Cyprus. We decided to start with this ""Extinguished country"" because we are a Mediterranean team (Jump to the ""Who we are"" section to learn more about us!). </p>
<p><i>La Repubblica di Venezia è uno stato millenario “scomparso” nel 1797. È una storia di rotte marittime, commercio di spezie e battaglie navali che attraversano Medioevo e Rinascimento. Geograficamente, comprendeva territori che oggi fanno parte di Italia, Slovenia, Croazia, Montenegro, Albania, Grecia e Cipro. Iniziamo con questo “Stato scomparso"" perché siamo una squadra sostanzialmente mediterranea (vai alla sezione ""Chi siamo"" per saperne di più!).</i></p>

<p>Before becoming the city we know, with its treasures and problems, balancing between mass tourism and the emigration of its inhabitants, Venice was the capital of a great republic. We want to take you back in time, when the flag of the Serenissima flew from Bergamo to Nicosia. Why? Precisely to depict and experience Venice differently, not only in its current historic centre, but also in those areas which for centuries were part of this Republic and contributed to its development. </p>
<p><i>Prima di diventare la città che conosciamo, con i suoi tesori e i suoi problemi, in bilico tra turismo di massa e l'emigrazione dei suoi abitanti, Venezia era la capitale di una grande repubblica. Vogliamo riportarti indietro al tempo in cui la bandiera di San Marco sventolava da Bergamo a Nicosia. Perché? Proprio per raccontare Venezia in un modo nuovo, visitando non solo il suo attuale centro storico, ma anche quelle aree che per secoli hanno fatto parte della Serenissima e hanno contribuito al suo sviluppo.</i></p>

Extinguished Countries is the first guidebook series to countries that no longer exist. We don’t follow today’s borders but take you on a journey through time and space to lost kingdoms, republics and empires, looking for what unites us rather than divides us. It's a time machine for travellers! Our first guidebook is about the Republic of Venice but many others will follow (Austro-Hungarian Empire, Ottoman Empire...).
Extinguished Countries è la prima serie di guide dedicate a paesi che non esistono più. Non seguiamo i confini di oggi, ma ti portiamo in viaggio nel tempo e nello spazio verso regni, repubbliche e imperi perduti, cercando ciò che ci unisce piuttosto che ciò che ci divide. È una macchina del tempo per viaggiatori! La nostra prima guida è sulla Serenissima ma molte altre seguiranno (Impero austro-ungarico, Impero ottomano...).
Here's the video in Italian | Qui il video in italiano :

The world as we know it today has changed many times throughout history. Take an old map from 100 or 200 years ago and try to point to some of your familiar places. Found yourself in trouble? Maybe they have a new name, or they're divided by a border that today no longer exists. That's the evolution of history: the state we live in succeeded an ancestor from the past, the language we speak has long and intricate roots, and even our identity is a combination of diverse influences. Extinguished Countries dives into all this!
Il mondo non è sempre stato come lo conosciamo oggi. Basta dare un’occhiata ad una cartina vecchia di 100 o 200 anni e si fa già fatica a riconoscere i luoghi più familiari, magari perché indicati con un altro nome, o perché separati da qualche confine oggi inesistente. È l'evoluzione della storia. Lo Stato in cui viviamo nasce da un antenato del passato, la lingua che parliamo ha radici lunghe e intricate e persino la nostra identità è una combinazione di diverse influenze. Le guide degli Stati scomparsi si immergono in tutto questo!
Why is this important | Perché è importante

At a time when Europe is experiencing resurgent nationalism, the Extinguished Countries guidebooks show that throughout history countries change and leave behind composite and stratified cultural legacies. As a result, today we have many things in common, not only with our neighbours, but also with people that might live far away but were once connected to us. There are legends, traditions, dishes that we share from our common past, and that bring us closer rather than farther apart.
In un momento in cui l'Europa vive un ritorno dei nazionalismi, le guide degli Stati scomparsi mostrano che nel corso della storia i paesi cambiano e lasciano dietro a sé delle eredità culturali composite e stratificate. Al punto che oggi, abbiamo molte cose in comune, non solo con i nostri vicini di casa ma anche con persone che abitano magari lontano da noi, ma a cui un tempo eravamo legati. Ci sono leggende, tradizioni, piatti che condividiamo dal nostro passato comune e che ci avvicinano agli altri piuttosto che separarci.

Brudet/Brodetto (a fish stew) connecting people :-)
This is not a nostalgic or revisionist journey. Even if our guides play the game of imagining that a former country still exists, their objective is not to celebrate defunct political realities. On the contrary: by interviewing people from Venice to Cyprus, we show different perspectives. Also, our guidebooks introduce a new way of travelling. You’ll be walking on today’s streets, but at the same time travelling back in time, following maps and itineraries from the past. It's a sort of augmented reality that allows you to hop on and off from the present into the past.  
Queste guide non sono né nostalgiche né revisioniste. Si prestano al gioco di immaginare che lo Stato scomparso esista ancora, ma il loro obiettivo non è quello di celebrare delle realtà politiche defunte. Al contrario: intervistando persone da Venezia a Cipro, vogliamo mostrare i diversi punti di vista. Inoltre, queste guide propongono un nuovo modo di viaggiare. Camminerai per le strade di oggi, ma viaggerai anche indietro nel tempo, seguendo mappe e itinerari del passato. È come realtà aumentata che ti permette di fare la spola tra presente e passato.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong><i>I’m Up To Something</i></strong> is a memoir about<strong> a first generation Latino and defining success</strong>. Being born to immigrant parents and low socio economic status meant overcoming adversity and the imposter syndrome after pursuing engineering as an undergraduate, which then allowed the <strong>leveraging of interpersonal and technical skills for real estate, investing and writing.</strong></p>
<p>Some early defining moments charting my present and future successes include: sales at the age of eight, being identified as a gifted child too late, overcoming low socio economic status, enrollment into foster care, heartbreak, near death experience and being the first in his family to attend and graduate from university.</p>
<p><br/>My hope is that by reading this book<strong> you will rediscover your own passions and creativity</strong> to then leverage interpersonal and technical skills for seemingly unrelated disciplines. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to learn that despite being first generation and having to “catch up” to those with more resources and established families, education, tenacity and imagination can be great assets towards advancement. I owe my success to having an empowered and educated community with astute professionals that provided mentorship in benchmarking my  career in STEM to then pursue real estate, investing and writing with confidence.</p>
<p><br/>In this book, you'll encounter multifaceted dimensions of overcoming the imposter syndrome as a first generation Latino and the power of education, self discipline and community through narratives like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being <strong>an entrepreneur at eight years old</strong> selling Pokemon cards to try and support his parents</li>
<li>
<strong>Leaving home at age seventeen </strong>for University as a necessary and difficult decision to <strong>overcome low socio economic status</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Presenting to notable members</strong> of the Metropolitan Water District during high school</li>
<li>Deciding to pursue <strong>concurrent careers in Engineering, Real Estate and Writing</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you are or know someone who is</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Rising</strong> from low socio economic status</li>
<li>An <strong>ally to the Latino/Latina community</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>First generation</strong> born in the United States</li>
<li>
<strong>A person of color </strong>in a white dominated industry</li>
<li>
<strong>Believe concurrent careers </strong>are a possible reality for you</li>
<li>Deliberating or deciding to pursue <strong>STEM as a field of interest</strong>
</li>
<li>A fan of stories dealing with <strong>overcoming adversity to achieve greatness</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>I’m Up To Something speaks to aspiring and existing STEM professionals and first generation Latinos/Latinas who want to grapple with pursuing multiple careers and the imposter syndrome in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that<i> I’m Up To Something</i> <strong>inspires introspection and fruitful dialogue</strong>, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Will I allow myself</strong> to have a satisfying career(s) and believe that I am capable?</li>
<li>How has my community involvement contributed to my development and branding?</li>

I’m Up To Something is a memoir about a first generation Latino and defining success. Being born to immigrant parents and low socio economic status meant overcoming adversity and the imposter syndrome after pursuing engineering as an undergraduate, which then allowed the leveraging of interpersonal and technical skills for real estate, investing and writing.
Some early defining moments charting my present and future successes include: sales at the age of eight, being identified as a gifted child too late, overcoming low socio economic status, enrollment into foster care, heartbreak, near death experience and being the first in his family to attend and graduate from university.
My hope is that by reading this book you will rediscover your own passions and creativity to then leverage interpersonal and technical skills for seemingly unrelated disciplines. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to learn that despite being first generation and having to “catch up” to those with more resources and established families, education, tenacity and imagination can be great assets towards advancement. I owe my success to having an empowered and educated community with astute professionals that provided mentorship in benchmarking my  career in STEM to then pursue real estate, investing and writing with confidence.
In this book, you'll encounter multifaceted dimensions of overcoming the imposter syndrome as a first generation Latino and the power of education, self discipline and community through narratives like:

Being an entrepreneur at eight years old selling Pokemon cards to try and support his parents

Leaving home at age seventeen for University as a necessary and difficult decision to overcome low socio economic status


Presenting to notable members of the Metropolitan Water District during high school
Deciding to pursue concurrent careers in Engineering, Real Estate and Writing


You will love this book if you are or know someone who is


Rising from low socio economic status
An ally to the Latino/Latina community


First generation born in the United States

A person of color in a white dominated industry

Believe concurrent careers are a possible reality for you
Deliberating or deciding to pursue STEM as a field of interest

A fan of stories dealing with overcoming adversity to achieve greatness


I’m Up To Something speaks to aspiring and existing STEM professionals and first generation Latinos/Latinas who want to grapple with pursuing multiple careers and the imposter syndrome in a new way.Ultimately, I hope that I’m Up To Something inspires introspection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:


Will I allow myself to have a satisfying career(s) and believe that I am capable?
How has my community involvement contributed to my development and branding?
How can I use adversity as a source of strength?
After a post pandemic world, will I be able to take advantage of virtual trend for my career(s)?

I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing the imposter syndrome, concurrent careers, adversity, professional development and education for advancement will change us all for the better.

I share with you real stories of failure, mistakes, wins, successes, and all the things that lead us from having nothing to being able to hang out in a studio in our pajamas all day. </p><p> </p><p>In this book (The Rogue Artist’s Guide To Rogue Marketing) I’ll talk about all the marketing rules in the art world and how I broke them in order to succeed my own way. I offer down to earth, authentic, fun, and simple advice, which can sometimes be a little hard to hear but may fire you up.</p><p>This is the second book in a series of books on how to live life as a successful rogue in the art world. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1601255328/hnkawb1bzozyiuejhgo1.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3>Who Am I?</h3><p>My name is Rafi Perez and I am the author of The Rogue Artist Series, I make my living as an artist, musician, and creative. My wife Klee (who will be mentioned a lot in this book) Is an artist, jeweler, and musician. I wrote this book because I had always been obsessed with living as a creative, but spent the majority of my life avoiding it because I was too afraid to fail at something I loved. After having spent 12 years in the ""comfort"" of the corporate world, I left and ventured on a creative journey that pushed me beyond what I thought was possible. I started with absolutely nothing to my name, and over the course of a decade, I have built an amazing life as a full-time creative. </p><p> </p><p>I have spent the last ten years collecting notes, documenting the process, testing out different theories, challenging the status quo, learning rules, and breaking them in order to create myself as a full-time artist who runs his own studio and lives life by his own rules. These books are a collection of that experience thus far. Starting with the Survival Guide, and then moving on to the mysterious world of marketing and money as an artist. </p><p> </p><p>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will understand how to grow your personal creative brand as an artist while still having fun. I hope to instill the same passion and excitement that I have for life and being a creative human in this modern world full of opportunities. Ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool or guide to help you understand how to grab the machete and cut your own trail through the dense forest that is the artist's life. </p><p> </p><p>I want to secretly inspire you to blaze your own trail as brightly as any awesome human can... and turn away from marketing courses that want you to follow the cookie-cutter crowd. If you’re not into that, I want you to enjoy the fun stories, cliff hangers, ridiculous situations, and all-out creative conundrums that fill the pages of this book.</p><p> </p><p>In this book, you’ll learn that the advice of most “art marketing experts” in the art world is crap and outdated… Luckily I’m not an expert, so who knows what kind of crazy shit is going to come out of my mouth. I will, however, point out several rules from people in marketing and lay out the flaws in their thinking and philosophy. I will also talk about what worked… They are not ALL bad.</p><p> </p><p>The main thing I will touch on throughout this book is the power of having the right mindset in approaching potentially disastrous situations or circumstances as you traverse your creative journey into the unknown. I will also talk about dealing with the naysayers who lurk in dark corners… or your house. </p><p> </p><p>You will love this book if you are a casual hobbyist, a fine artist, a musician, a creative, an artist looking to up their game, or you are simply a human who breathes air. Especially if you are curious about ways to venture out and do your own thing in life. The Rogue Artist’s Guide To Rogue Marketing And Money is a non-fiction book that speaks to rebels, non-conformists, artists, creative humans, and content creators who are looking at growing their ability to pursue their dreams and make them a reality... their own way. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1601255370/eosjzg62twh6jfozdjoo.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h2>The Book - The Rogue Artist's: Guide To Rogue Marketing</h2><h3>Outline - TABLE OF CONTENTS- (This May Change As I Put This Book Together and more may be added)</h3><p><strong>WHY I WROTE THIS BOOK </strong></p><p>Artists Marketing Programs Are All Selling The Same Shtick. </p><p>What I hope You Get Out Of This Book.</p><p><strong>THE UGLY TRUTH ABOUT THIS BOOK </strong></p><p>Why Many Artists Fail.</p><p>This IS NOT Easy, But It Is Simple.</p><p>You Have To Figure Out YOUR Way.</p><p>You Are Going To Have To Avoid Being Unremarkable And Safe.</p><p>Coloring In The Lines Eventually Leads To Boring But Is Safe.</p><p>This Is Going To Take Time But It Will Be Sustainable.</p><p><strong>TRADITIONAL MARKETING WRAPPED IN A BOW</strong></p><p>List Of Traditional Marketing Rules To Break As A Rogue</p><p><strong>ROGUE MARKETING?

This means that I need your help to make the physical product a reality.

This book is going to go against the grain of most typical artist marketing courses. I am going to defy the standard and go rogue and hopefully show you that marketing is not this mysterious thing that is beyond your understanding. My hope is that by the end of reading this book you will find that the most powerful, one of a kind, and creative marketing can be fun and part of your unique creative journey.Changes made to this campaign means that you can get not one but two full books plus the workbook.HERE ARE THE BOOKS AND THE BONUS THANK YOU STUFF I'LL BE SENDING YOU:TIMELINE: (Subject to change if we run into complications.

You can add it as an add-on during checkout. That book will be released in March 2021 along with the audiobook. NEW COVER DESIGNS :)Special Creative Editions For IndiegogoYour books will be signed special release editions for our Indiegogo supporters, so there will be a little extra in your books from Klee and me that the general public will not be privy to when the book is officially launched in January (such as signed posters, bookmarks, and anything else we think is fun). The hardcover books are limited special edition color copies. These will only be available for this campaign, so anyone with a color copy can show off how awesome their color copy is.The Rogue Artist’s Marketing Brainstorming Journal is a workbook for keeping track of and brainstorming your own rogue marketing and money techniques.   *I forgot to list the marketing workbook in the PREORDER LIMITED EDITION COLOR HARDCOVER... But it is included as one of the items, unfortunately, I can't change it on the tier. Story of My BooksThe Rogue Artist series is meant to challenge the perspective and story of the starving artist, build confidence in your ability to promote yourself and your art, and to build trust in your own unique way of approaching your career as an artist... and human. I intertwined my amusing art career journey with the stories of other creative mavericks who inspired me to pave my own way. I talk about all the harebrained ideas that worked despite the naysayers. I share with you real stories of failure, mistakes, wins, successes, and all the things that lead us from having nothing to being able to hang out in a studio in our pajamas all day.  In this book (The Rogue Artist’s Guide To Rogue Marketing) I’ll talk about all the marketing rules in the art world and how I broke them in order to succeed my own way. I offer down to earth, authentic, fun, and simple advice, which can sometimes be a little hard to hear but may fire you up.This is the second book in a series of books on how to live life as a successful rogue in the art world. Who Am I?My name is Rafi Perez and I am the author of The Rogue Artist Series, I make my living as an artist, musician, and creative. My wife Klee (who will be mentioned a lot in this book) Is an artist, jeweler, and musician. I wrote this book because I had always been obsessed with living as a creative, but spent the majority of my life avoiding it because I was too afraid to fail at something I loved. After having spent 12 years in the ""comfort"" of the corporate world, I left and ventured on a creative journey that pushed me beyond what I thought was possible. I started with absolutely nothing to my name, and over the course of a decade, I have built an amazing life as a full-time creative.  I have spent the last ten years collecting notes, documenting the process, testing out different theories, challenging the status quo, learning rules, and breaking them in order to create myself as a full-time artist who runs his own studio and lives life by his own rules. These books are a collection of that experience thus far. Starting with the Survival Guide, and then moving on to the mysterious world of marketing and money as an artist.  My hope is that, in reading this book, you will understand how to grow your personal creative brand as an artist while still having fun. I hope to instill the same passion and excitement that I have for life and being a creative human in this modern world full of opportunities. Ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool or guide to help you understand how to grab the machete and cut your own trail through the dense forest that is the artist's life.  I want to secretly inspire you to blaze your own trail as brightly as any awesome human can... and turn away from marketing courses that want you to follow the cookie-cutter crowd. If you’re not into that, I want you to enjoy the fun stories, cliff hangers, ridiculous situations, and all-out creative conundrums that fill the pages of this book. In this book, you’ll learn that the advice of most “art marketing experts” in the art world is crap and outdated… Luckily I’m not an expert, so who knows what kind of crazy shit is going to come out of my mouth. I will, however, point out several rules from people in marketing and lay out the flaws in their thinking and philosophy. I will also talk about what worked… They are not ALL bad. The main thing I will touch on throughout this book is the power of having the right mindset in approaching potentially disastrous situations or circumstances as you traverse your creative journey into the unknown. I will also talk about dealing with the naysayers who lurk in dark corners… or your house.  You will love this book if you are a casual hobbyist, a fine artist, a musician, a creative, an artist looking to up their game, or you are simply a human who breathes air. Especially if you are curious about ways to venture out and do your own thing in life. The Rogue Artist’s Guide To Rogue Marketing And Money is a non-fiction book that speaks to rebels, non-conformists, artists, creative humans, and content creators who are looking at growing their ability to pursue their dreams and make them a reality... their own way. The Book - The Rogue Artist's: Guide To Rogue MarketingOutline - TABLE OF CONTENTS- (This May Change As I Put This Book Together and more may be added)WHY I WROTE THIS BOOK Artists Marketing Programs Are All Selling The Same Shtick. What I hope You Get Out Of This Book.THE UGLY TRUTH ABOUT THIS BOOK Why Many Artists Fail.This IS NOT Easy, But It Is Simple.You Have To Figure Out YOUR Way.You Are Going To Have To Avoid Being Unremarkable And Safe.Coloring In The Lines Eventually Leads To Boring But Is Safe.This Is Going To Take Time But It Will Be Sustainable.TRADITIONAL MARKETING WRAPPED IN A BOWList Of Traditional Marketing Rules To Break As A RogueROGUE MARKETING?

This book isn't aimed at the mass market - it's aimed at a specific type of person: the kind of person that wants to be inspired to blaze their own trail and embrace their creative wild side. We have a following on YouTube, our blog, and podcast, that listens to me ramble on about life and being a full-time creative, and this book is written with those rabble-rousers in mind. I think a traditional publishing house would be confused by the content which is not the traditional art career crap you find at the bookstore.  I want to achieve my vision for the book with as much creative control over the final product as possible. This means that I need your help to make the physical product a reality. The project goal will cover the initial print run, and enable me to place a well-produced, exclusive crowd-funded edition of The Rogue Artist's: Survival Guide in your hands... you rabble-rouser you.  Individual Items are:Ebook Digital Download - A PDF Digital Copy Of My Book.

It features a dysfunctional group of teenagers working out their emotional trauma and uniting against an oppressive monarchy.</p><p>My name is Toby Cerezo, and I am the author of <i>Sparks of Rebellion</i>. I wrote this book because I wanted to create something that people could read to give themselves hope, especially while facing that truly fearsome beast known as adulthood.</p><p>I hope that this book helps to restore people’s faith in the collective potential of the world, as well as their own potential. In a world that reinforces how terrible everything is for the sake of ratings, it’s easy to forget that there will always be a way to make everyone’s lives better. It’s also easy to forget that anybody could find that way, whether they be young or old, straight or LGBTQ+, indigenous or an immigrant, religious or atheistic, etcetera.</p><p>In <i>Sparks of Rebellion</i>, the world of Threigsinn was shaped by thoughts and abandoned by fallible gods that were ashamed of their folly. The protagonist, Arvin White, is a cynical and self-doubting prodigy who is visited by a royal emissary with an invitation to a masquerade ball with his only friend, Chepha Vulcana. Along the way, they meet Rakim Evergreen and Alice Livingston, who recruit them in a plot to stop Duke Ferdinand Marioneta from taking the human throne and using genocide to gain public favor. After a mysterious goddess tries(and fails) to establish a good relationship with Arvin, four days of encountering long-repressed trauma and his newfound <b>teenage angst</b> threaten to rend his resolve and sanity to shreds. Can Arvin and his friends combine their efforts to steal reports from the duke at his own party? In most circles, it's considered poor etiquette to steal from guests, but some sacrifices must be made for the greater good.</p><p>This book features a lovably awful cast akin to that of The Breakfast Club, self-aware and self-deprecating humor, and classic tropes flipped on their heads. It also contains vivid descriptions of anxiety and PTSD, so if you aren’t a fan of that kind of content, then this isn’t for you.</p><p>Technically; according to my publisher, New Degree Press; this is the part where I tell you the discussions that I want Sparks of Rebellion to provoke. But despite all of the things I mentioned above, I believe that books should be open for readers to interpret. I don’t want anyone taking tests about the symbolism of Arvin's boots, but seeing how so many people have interpreted so many different projects in so many different ways makes my heart swell. I think it’s best to promote respectful disagreements and debates, especially when so many people are so quick to anger behind a screen.</p><p>In the end, no matter what you may think of me or my life story, I hope that Sparks of Rebellion lets you experience a full range of emotions that will leave you anticipating my next release. Unrealistic? Perhaps. That’s why I said “hope.” There’d be no point in hoping for something that simply falls at your feet. Maybe that’s what I think the greatest takeaway from Sparks of Rebellion is. While it is important that people have the chance to feel comfortable when escaping to another world, I feel that it is also necessary for people to set goals for themselves that aren't guaranteed to be met. After all, heroes can conquer more than monsters. One’s own inner demons feel like a good place to start.</p><h2>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h2><p>New Degree Press is working with me to publish <i>Sparks of Rebellion</i>.

</ul><h3> </h3><h3>About the Author</h3><p>Toby Cerezo is a junior in high school. He’s been writing Sparks of Rebellion since he was a freshman, and he has stories that he started back in seventh grade gathering dust in his Google Drive.<br/><br/>Toby wrote Sparks of Rebellion while he was going through a creative and mental slump. As seems to be the case with most people his age, middle school left Toby feeling drained and hopeless. It was only because of the friends that he made along the way that he could deal with his own emotional baggage, and he wants to help others feel that same way.<br/><br/>When he’s not writing, Toby blitzes through his schoolwork, plays games with his friends(mainly VALORANT and D&amp;D), and watches streamers like Arcadum and QuarterJade on Twitch. His friends have been generally supportive of his efforts, if not a little tired of the constant updates regarding the publishing process.<br/><br/>For more, you can contact Toby at twarc034@gmail.com, look at his art at @crabs4dayz on Instagram, and learn weirdly personal information at @my_gentle_puck on TikTok. You can also find playlists for Arvin, Chepha, Rakim, Alice and more from Toby Cerezo on Spotify.</p><h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2><p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is mailing the finished book to you guys. Much like several other problems I've faced in the past, I have totally avoided this issue by including the cost of mailing and shipping the signed copies in each pre-order tier.<br/><br/>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book depends on who I publish with. I'll be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we ship the pre-order rewards to you as early as possible. We'll keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as to when <i>Sparks of Rebellion</i> will publish. You'll know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship; I'm on a first-name basis with a lot of sleep paralysis demons. Oh, and, like, we'll email you, I guess.</p><h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2><p>Being an unemployed teenager whose bills are being paid by his parents, I fully understand if you can't financially back <i>Sparks of Rebellion.  </i>Luckily, if you're still inclined to support the start of the Fragments series, I have a short list of other things you can do!</p><p>For one, you can signal boost my pre-sale campaign on Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and LinkedIn with your friends, family, moots, and network. Please use #SparksOfRebellion and tag me and my publisher, New Degree Press, so that we can put your posts on blast.</p><p>You can also share my Pre-Sale Campaign Page via Indiegogo at the top of the page!</p><p>Lastly, you can share my book with 5 friends, family members, or co-workers who you think would enjoy it with a DM or a text on social media.</p><p>Thank you so much for of all of your love and support!<br/><br/>Best wishes,<br/>Toby Cerezo</p></div>","What is Sparks of Rebellion?Sparks of Rebellion is an unorthodox take on high fantasy reminiscent of John Hughes movies.

I don’t want anyone taking tests about the symbolism of Arvin's boots, but seeing how so many people have interpreted so many different projects in so many different ways makes my heart swell. I think it’s best to promote respectful disagreements and debates, especially when so many people are so quick to anger behind a screen.In the end, no matter what you may think of me or my life story, I hope that Sparks of Rebellion lets you experience a full range of emotions that will leave you anticipating my next release. Unrealistic? Perhaps. That’s why I said “hope.” There’d be no point in hoping for something that simply falls at your feet. Maybe that’s what I think the greatest takeaway from Sparks of Rebellion is. While it is important that people have the chance to feel comfortable when escaping to another world, I feel that it is also necessary for people to set goals for themselves that aren't guaranteed to be met. After all, heroes can conquer more than monsters. One’s own inner demons feel like a good place to start.What I Need & What You'll GetNew Degree Press is working with me to publish Sparks of Rebellion.

 About the AuthorToby Cerezo is a junior in high school. He’s been writing Sparks of Rebellion since he was a freshman, and he has stories that he started back in seventh grade gathering dust in his Google Drive.Toby wrote Sparks of Rebellion while he was going through a creative and mental slump. As seems to be the case with most people his age, middle school left Toby feeling drained and hopeless. It was only because of the friends that he made along the way that he could deal with his own emotional baggage, and he wants to help others feel that same way.When he’s not writing, Toby blitzes through his schoolwork, plays games with his friends(mainly VALORANT and D&D), and watches streamers like Arcadum and QuarterJade on Twitch. His friends have been generally supportive of his efforts, if not a little tired of the constant updates regarding the publishing process.For more, you can contact Toby at twarc034@gmail.com, look at his art at @crabs4dayz on Instagram, and learn weirdly personal information at @my_gentle_puck on TikTok. You can also find playlists for Arvin, Chepha, Rakim, Alice and more from Toby Cerezo on Spotify.Risks & ChallengesThe biggest challenge with publishing a book is mailing the finished book to you guys. Much like several other problems I've faced in the past, I have totally avoided this issue by including the cost of mailing and shipping the signed copies in each pre-order tier.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book depends on who I publish with. I'll be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we ship the pre-order rewards to you as early as possible. We'll keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as to when Sparks of Rebellion will publish. You'll know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship; I'm on a first-name basis with a lot of sleep paralysis demons. Oh, and, like, we'll email you, I guess.Other Ways You Can HelpBeing an unemployed teenager whose bills are being paid by his parents, I fully understand if you can't financially back Sparks of Rebellion.  Luckily, if you're still inclined to support the start of the Fragments series, I have a short list of other things you can do!For one, you can signal boost my pre-sale campaign on Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and LinkedIn with your friends, family, moots, and network. Please use #SparksOfRebellion and tag me and my publisher, New Degree Press, so that we can put your posts on blast.You can also share my Pre-Sale Campaign Page via Indiegogo at the top of the page!Lastly, you can share my book with 5 friends, family members, or co-workers who you think would enjoy it with a DM or a text on social media.Thank you so much for of all of your love and support!Best wishes,Toby Cerezo",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

The year, 2020, has changed people's lives. A big change in my own life was landing a job as a Business Analyst that turned into a promotion, which gave me the chance to become a virtual leader, leading twenty remote team members. Knowing that I did not have experience in leading a remote team, I searched for ways to help me build my team. <br/><br/>I wrote this book because I've found that others who are new in remote work are also having the same issues as I am, i.e., building and strengthening connections when the typical serendipitous meet in the hallway moments no longer exist. This book is the results of my findings.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how to build a culture within your virtual team and learn how to alleviate some of your pain points.

Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you build and lead a virtual team, enhancing safe spaces in the work environment that is empowering and connected.<br/><br/>You'll learn how to promote an environment of inclusion and build and lead a remote team. You'll see that fostering a climate of inclusivity may be as easy as having people in the office open their PC and view the meeting through their screens. <br/><br/>In the early years of Trello, few of their workers were remote. Trello had a town hall meeting every month to see the CEO, present their demos, meet new members, and ask questions. In their New York headquarters, the New Yorkers would meet in an office while the remote people would be on the screen, and they would have their town hall that way. They found out that that was not the right way to do it and quickly realized that it made the remote people feel like they were missing out on something and did not feel like they were included. The solution they came up with was to have the New Yorkers be on their computer as well. That way, they were all together doing the same thing and having the same access to the same resource.<br/><br/>You’ll also learn how to improve on clarity remotely. Dr. Monica Riordan, who has PhD in experimental psychology from the University of Memphis, introduced an emoji study. Her primary research area is exploring the way people are able to communicate emotions in computer-mediated environments.

<h2>About the Book</h2>
<p>When you know the ending of your story, how would you write the journey of your life?<br/><br/>In a fictional world not unlike ours, where people worship many gods and the elements tell us secrets, a young boy grapples with growing up when he is among the last generation of people to live.<br/><br/>During the sunset of his seventh birthday, Dante’s greatest challenge is coming to terms with the passage of Time and the inevitable changes this golden boy must face. No wisdom from the Great Spirits of the World – the Sun, Wind, Sea, and Gaia – could have ever prepared Dante for what the Fates have in store: humanity is infertile. Deemed “Aphrodite’s Curse,” this mysterious plague upends the framework of society with social upheaval, economic crises, technological advances, ecological revelations, and biological ultimatums.<br/><br/>Set in the seaside town of Pax, this story centers around Dante’s family and that of a neighbor, an inquisitive and thoughtful girl named Rose, to explore how relationships evolve and adapt in the backdrop of a prolonged Armageddon.<br/><br/>My name is Saba Nia and I am the author of <i>Carpe Diem</i>. I wrote this book because I wanted to explore human nature and how people interact with their environment, communities, and themselves when the longstanding conventions of life are challenged.<br/><br/>My desire is that, in reading this book, you will discover how to exert agency in your own life. I want you to view this book as an opportunity to grapple with the beautiful impermanence of our own stories that we must always strive to embrace. I hope that you enjoy joining Dante on his journey to “seize the day.”<br/> </p>
<h2>About the Audience</h2>
<p>Channeling the spirit of epic poetry and inspired by beloved stories like<i> The Little Prince </i>and<i> The Alchemist, Carpe Diem</i> is a commentary on how people come to grips with their mortality. Written in lyrical prose and infused with poetry, this story incorporates a slow-burn, philosophical approach to the end of the world to weave together a fable about the golden child who resists being an active agent in his life.<br/><br/>While grounded in character relationships and personal growth, <i>Carpe Diem</i> is an ode to the sci-fi and dystopian novels that sparked my love of literature. This story challenges readers to think critically about the consequences of an infertility pandemic. Who would society blame? Would people abandon all decorum and decency or would they want to end on a good note? What does it mean to be alive if, by biological terms, you are no longer a species? Would people abuse one another and the environment or would they atone for their mistakes? How would people resist aging? How would they use technology? What would be the role of artificial intelligence and machines? How would countries fight for resources? What would the economy look like when industries are no longer needed? Finally, how do we approach life when there is no reason to care about trophies or awards, no incentive to show off for posterity, no harm in sharing and taking risks instead of saving and waiting?<br/><br/>This book is for the scientists, artists, and dreamers, the lovers of epic poetry and mythology, readers ready to decipher and analyze minute sensory details, name choices, and plot points, and yet also those who enjoy complex character development. This book is written in a lyrical manner with its inclusion of poetry, but it is grounded in a deep respect for science fiction and dystopian novels. Yet, the book is equally made for the lovers of both Eastern and Western mythologies, indigenous communities, and classical folklore. You will love this book if you enjoy coming of age stories and exploring human relationships, but also desire a gripping plot.<br/><br/><i>Carpe Diem</i> speaks to young adults and seasoned readers who want to grapple with exploring human nature in a new way. What would you do if you were the last generation to live? What are the limitations that prevent people from renouncing passivity and how do they overcome them? How do you create meaning in your life knowing it too will end?<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that<i> Carpe Diem</i> inspires reflection and generates more introspection and curiosity. I look forward to engaging with you and other readers who resonate with this story and hearing about yours.<br/> </p>

<h2>About the Author</h2>Saba Nia is pre-medical student majoring in Psychology and minoring in Creative Writing and Biology at Georgetown University. Passionate about the intersection of several fields, in addition to writing creative prose and poetry, Saba advocates for the mental health of migrants, volunteers to promote educational equity, researches psychology and the medical uses of expressive writing, studies both environmental and biological sciences, and enjoys learning about different cultures and languages, especially from the Middle East.<br/><br/>Saba wrote <i>Carpe Diem</i> because she wanted to tell a story that reflects her passions, her favorite genres, styles of writing, and inspirations, and all the dynamic people she’s met. A novel for all, <i>Carpe Diem</i> includes characters of different ethnicity, age, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, gender, and ability, neuroatypical individuals, indigenous people, and people coping with mental health issues.<br/><br/>Saba is still learning not only how to become a better writer and scholar but also a more active agent in her own life. It took seven years for an idea to become a published book, but Saba is proud of all the wisdom she has gained that has inspired her to make this story possible.<br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Saba Nia at sabaniawriting@gmail.com and @saba_nia_writing on Instagram, @_SabaNia_ on Twitter, and Saba Nia on <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/the.saba.nia/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/saba-nia-8509bb216/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LinkedIn</a>.<br/><br/><br/> <h2>International Preorders</h2> For international preorders, please do the following:<ul>

<p> </p>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.<br/><br/>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies are expected to ship.<br/> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>If you would like to help a young author's book journey or support the portion of proceeds that will go towards migrant resettlement and integration, <strong>feel free to make a contribution of any donation size you are comfortable with.</strong><br/>I will also reward the top 3 people who refer the most backers at the end of the campaign (30 days). Here's how:<ul>
<li>At the top of the campaign page, you will see the ""share"" buttons. Click on the ""chain"" icon to get a custom link just for you. (Note: don't use the URL in the browser window as it won't work to track referrals and you won't get credit)</li>
<li>Copy that link and paste it on your social media, email it to a friend, or text a fellow book lover.</li>
<li>When someone clicks on that link and backs the book, you get 1 entry!</li>

</div></div>","About the Book
When you know the ending of your story, how would you write the journey of your life?In a fictional world not unlike ours, where people worship many gods and the elements tell us secrets, a young boy grapples with growing up when he is among the last generation of people to live.During the sunset of his seventh birthday, Dante’s greatest challenge is coming to terms with the passage of Time and the inevitable changes this golden boy must face. No wisdom from the Great Spirits of the World – the Sun, Wind, Sea, and Gaia – could have ever prepared Dante for what the Fates have in store: humanity is infertile. Deemed “Aphrodite’s Curse,” this mysterious plague upends the framework of society with social upheaval, economic crises, technological advances, ecological revelations, and biological ultimatums.Set in the seaside town of Pax, this story centers around Dante’s family and that of a neighbor, an inquisitive and thoughtful girl named Rose, to explore how relationships evolve and adapt in the backdrop of a prolonged Armageddon.My name is Saba Nia and I am the author of Carpe Diem. I wrote this book because I wanted to explore human nature and how people interact with their environment, communities, and themselves when the longstanding conventions of life are challenged.My desire is that, in reading this book, you will discover how to exert agency in your own life. I want you to view this book as an opportunity to grapple with the beautiful impermanence of our own stories that we must always strive to embrace. I hope that you enjoy joining Dante on his journey to “seize the day.” 
About the Audience
Channeling the spirit of epic poetry and inspired by beloved stories like The Little Prince and The Alchemist, Carpe Diem is a commentary on how people come to grips with their mortality. Written in lyrical prose and infused with poetry, this story incorporates a slow-burn, philosophical approach to the end of the world to weave together a fable about the golden child who resists being an active agent in his life.While grounded in character relationships and personal growth, Carpe Diem is an ode to the sci-fi and dystopian novels that sparked my love of literature. This story challenges readers to think critically about the consequences of an infertility pandemic. Who would society blame? Would people abandon all decorum and decency or would they want to end on a good note? What does it mean to be alive if, by biological terms, you are no longer a species? Would people abuse one another and the environment or would they atone for their mistakes? How would people resist aging? How would they use technology? What would be the role of artificial intelligence and machines? How would countries fight for resources? What would the economy look like when industries are no longer needed? Finally, how do we approach life when there is no reason to care about trophies or awards, no incentive to show off for posterity, no harm in sharing and taking risks instead of saving and waiting?This book is for the scientists, artists, and dreamers, the lovers of epic poetry and mythology, readers ready to decipher and analyze minute sensory details, name choices, and plot points, and yet also those who enjoy complex character development. This book is written in a lyrical manner with its inclusion of poetry, but it is grounded in a deep respect for science fiction and dystopian novels. Yet, the book is equally made for the lovers of both Eastern and Western mythologies, indigenous communities, and classical folklore. You will love this book if you enjoy coming of age stories and exploring human relationships, but also desire a gripping plot.Carpe Diem speaks to young adults and seasoned readers who want to grapple with exploring human nature in a new way. What would you do if you were the last generation to live? What are the limitations that prevent people from renouncing passivity and how do they overcome them? How do you create meaning in your life knowing it too will end?Ultimately, I hope that Carpe Diem inspires reflection and generates more introspection and curiosity. I look forward to engaging with you and other readers who resonate with this story and hearing about yours.

About the AuthorSaba Nia is pre-medical student majoring in Psychology and minoring in Creative Writing and Biology at Georgetown University. Passionate about the intersection of several fields, in addition to writing creative prose and poetry, Saba advocates for the mental health of migrants, volunteers to promote educational equity, researches psychology and the medical uses of expressive writing, studies both environmental and biological sciences, and enjoys learning about different cultures and languages, especially from the Middle East.Saba wrote Carpe Diem because she wanted to tell a story that reflects her passions, her favorite genres, styles of writing, and inspirations, and all the dynamic people she’s met. A novel for all, Carpe Diem includes characters of different ethnicity, age, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, gender, and ability, neuroatypical individuals, indigenous people, and people coping with mental health issues.Saba is still learning not only how to become a better writer and scholar but also a more active agent in her own life. It took seven years for an idea to become a published book, but Saba is proud of all the wisdom she has gained that has inspired her to make this story possible.For more information, you can connect with Saba Nia at sabaniawriting@gmail.com and @saba_nia_writing on Instagram, @_SabaNia_ on Twitter, and Saba Nia on Facebook and LinkedIn. International Preorders For international preorders, please do the following:

Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies are expected to ship. 
 
Other Ways You Can HelpIf you would like to help a young author's book journey or support the portion of proceeds that will go towards migrant resettlement and integration, feel free to make a contribution of any donation size you are comfortable with.I will also reward the top 3 people who refer the most backers at the end of the campaign (30 days). Here's how:
At the top of the campaign page, you will see the ""share"" buttons. Click on the ""chain"" icon to get a custom link just for you. (Note: don't use the URL in the browser window as it won't work to track referrals and you won't get credit)
Copy that link and paste it on your social media, email it to a friend, or text a fellow book lover.
When someone clicks on that link and backs the book, you get 1 entry!

She has enjoyed imagining the lives of people from the Bible for many years. One Christmas she wrote monologues for each of her family members.

She has also been commissioned to write monologues for retreats, and for an academic journal to be published in the fall of 2021.</p><p>And so, these two groups of writings came together under the title of “People and Places of Sacred Interior Spaces.” The idea of interior spaces speaks both to the imagination as well as that beautiful space inside each of us where we encounter the Divine whisperings of the Spirit.

<p>My name is Alok Appadurai and I have been on a 15-year journey to change the world. When I look down at my young child asleep in his bed, I know I have to make the world a better place for him and future generations to grow up in! I must!

<br/>
<p><b>Why believe in me?</b> I work 6.5 days/week to change the world. I spend virtually every waking moment dedicated to producing positive impacts on people's lives.<b> I don't drink, I don't smoke, I live in a humble home</b>, and put everything on the line all the time for what I believe in. </p>
<p>The book is based on anecdotes from my own life in the trenches of trying to change the world, some funny, some sad; from 20 years of human experiences traveling to 30 countries, fatherhood, being a social entrepreneur, coming from a mixed-race household, losing my mother to cancer, my years teaching 4th grade, failures, humor, a deep belief in empathy, and a track record of completely turning my own life around in order to increase my positive impacts on people's lives and the planet over the last decade. </p>
<p><b>This is not a theoretical abstract on change: </b>this is the book I wish I had been able to read in my 20's when I was asking questions about how I could change my life to <b>make a difference in the world</b>. This is literally my roadmap for how we get our world back on track. I can't do it alone: it will take millions of people making millions of positive changes, but to blindly hope for that without giving people a plan for WHAT to do is ridiculous. I know this sounds completely unbelievable, but through my own journey to change my own life, I passionately believe each of us is a direct participant for the better or the worse in what happens in the world.

<h3>Welcome to the Florida Writers Project</h3>
<p>For the past 10 years, Wordier Than Thou has connected Florida writers and readers in fun, offbeat ways, whether it's through immersive theater projects or drag and burlesque shows or themed storytelling events. </p>
<p>Now, we want to publish the work of Florida authors. We're raising funds for our first publishing project, Tennessee Murder Ballad, the debut novel of Heather Jones.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic pushed back our publication timeline for Tennessee Murder Ballad, but we're back on track and plan to release it this summer. Pre-order your copy today!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>About Tennessee Murder Ballad</h3>
<p>In April 1848, preacher Paul Crane rides into a lonesome Appalachian town and kills Ellen Bridges, a widow whose music he believes to be witchcraft, by throwing her into a well.

About Tennessee Murder Ballad
In April 1848, preacher Paul Crane rides into a lonesome Appalachian town and kills Ellen Bridges, a widow whose music he believes to be witchcraft, by throwing her into a well. A group of children, including her grandson, Carter, push him in after her to avenge her murder. As the preacher disappears into the darkness, he curses the children, the town, and the mountains where they live.
Eight of the children grow up to survive the American Civil War only to re-encounter the preacher’s curse. But the music and love of Ellen Bridges have also survived in the mountains. During four days in April 1866, as the moon waxes full, a sinister circus appears on Ellen’s former property, and a fire rages down the mountain, each of the remaining children, now adults, meets their destiny of redemption, or death.

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p><i>The Hard Parts of Life</i> is a book about the crystals that living things make to survive: things like phytoliths, shells, and bones. I have compiled interviews with experts about how these crystals––called biominerals––form and what we can learn from them, from understanding past environments and what life might look like on other planets to revolutionizing materials and medicine.<br/><br/>My name is Robert Ulrich and I am the author of <i>The Hard Parts of Life</i>. I wrote this book because I want to share what biominerals are and what we can learn from them. The stories that biominerals tell teach us about past worlds, and the processes that create biominerals model how to make strong materials in sustainable ways.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For me, this book also marks the beginning of a new writing practice: a foray into creative science writing. My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover a newfound fascination and appreciation for nature and life. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for biominerals and the science that happens at the interface of multiple disciplines. There is so much that goes into the making of a tooth, a pearl, a bone, and the research around them, and by studying them has profound impact. In this book, we learn: How does the chemistry of a shell tell us about ocean conditions? What can a fossil tooth tell us about the evolution of dinosaurs? How does studying pearl help us create organs? Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you think about how seemingly disparate things might be connected and what we can learn from nature, which has been making these materials for billions of years.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about personal stories of scientists, how they came into science, and the science they do. You'll hear stories such as...<br/><br/>Dr. Hannah Carroll’s and Dr. Dan Ibarra’s, who tell us about why biominerals and knowing about the past is important for informing climate predictions.<br/><br/>Dr. Joby Hollis’s, who tells about how understanding biominerals—and how organic material gets trapped inside them—can aide us in the search for extraterrestrial life.<br/><br/>Dr. Ronke Olabisi’s, who teaches us about how bones form and how studying pearl can inform regenerative medicine.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you are interested in science, want to know more about some of the people who do it, and curious about the worlds both inside and around you. <br/><br/><i>The Hard Parts of Life</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to people who are curious about the natural world and scientists, current and future, who want to look at how nature and what we can learn from it.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Book - <i>The Hard Parts of Life</i>
</h3>
<p>The book is written into three parts.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the introduction + chapter 1. Here, we start with learning what life’s hard parts - biominerals - are and what we know about when biomineralization, the process of forming biominerals, evolved.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains chapters 2 and 3. This is where we talk about how biominerals are a window to the past. From Dr. Raquel Bryant, Alex Villa, and Kalani Heinz, we learn about what biominerals can tell us about the environments and climates. From Jade Knighton, we learn about what biominerals can tell us about past life.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> contains chapters 4 through 9. In the last part of the book, we learn about the many implications— implications that touch our everyday lives— that biomineral research affords us. Biominerals hold the keys to the future of climate prediction, the search for extraterrestrial life, and medicine.</p>

<h3>About the Author</h3>Rob is an award-winning scientist––holding fellowships with the National Science Foundation and the Center for Diverse Leadership in Science––currently pursuing their Ph.D. at the University of California, Los Angeles. Their research looks at how living things make crystalline materials using geochemistry. They have published peer-reviewed research papers, Op-Eds, and [now!] a book as well as spoken at the California and New York Academies of Sciences and appeared on popular science podcasts such as 'Ologies' and 'Talk Nerdy'<br/><br/>Rob wrote this book because they love the science they do. They research an incredibly important part of life at a fundamental level, and the research itself spans multiple scientific disciplines—pulling from biology, chemistry, geology, and materials science-- and has applications that transcend them and that will impact our daily lives. Rob hopes that this book makes curious people more curious, and that readers are fascinated by the science and the people behind it.<br/><br/>Even though the topic is close to their Ph.D. research, Rob knows they still have much to learn, and writing this book made that ever more clear. With new knowledge comes new questions, and this book is a manifestation of Rob’s own curiosity and their want to share it. While Rob has experience in writing and publishing research articles, this book marks the beginning of their exploration into creative science writing and a new writing process for them.

<p> </p>
<p>The Dream of Strapless </p>
<p><strong>In 2020, I burned it all down to write poetry. I left a 22-year-long career in high-tech. </strong>Burning it down means I can still feel the heat from the flames, and hear the crackle of the fire. It is all very much still alive. It’s uncomfortable peeling off the day-job identity among other layers. But I'm learning to sit with it and ask myself the hard questions.  I would love to share what that's like in my new book of poetry.  <br/><br/>Hi, my name is Neelam Patel and<strong> I believe in a world where vulnerability is regarded with the same respect as logic</strong>, so we all can show up as whole, and really connect instead of constantly missing each other in plain sight.  In my new book Strapless, I’ll explore the intersection between vulnerability, shame, and self acceptance. I found there’s no jolting force to empowerment; it’s a retreat. It was the acceptance of all the colors of my feelings that led me into myself. </p>
<p>My collection of poetry is <strong><i>not</i> about the before and after of a hero's journey</strong>. I remained curious about the <strong>messy middle</strong>. I’m learning that’s where the light is. It’s not at the end of the tunnel. It’s right here, in the messy, complicated middle.<br/><br/><strong>I became tired of the simple Instagram-scrubbed stories </strong>that went from “I used to be so ashamed of X” to “Now that I’m a grown adult, I'm empowered..”  Those statements caused some level of shame,- or, in clearer terms: the feeling of ""I should already be healed and in a different emotional place than I am"". And that's pretty heavy, because it's shame <i>about</i> the shame, which traps us inside of ourselves.  So, the questions I ask in this book are:<strong> Isn't the middle-ground where we are all actually living in,</strong> empowered or otherwise?  And if so, then how do I make room for all of that?  </p>
<p>My hope for this collection is that others will feel less alone in their own honest feelings and take the steps to share them with a trusted friend — it is in the sharing that we release their power and we stop hiding our parts <strong>so we can create bonds that really hold us together in this wide world</strong>.  </p>
<p>You will enjoy this book if you want to go into the deep world of the<strong> Heroine’s Journey </strong>where she dives into herself, and where<strong> she lives in order to experience living</strong>, and takes sheer delight in it. </p>
<p><strong>This book is raw and vulnerable, </strong>like the feeling when you wear something strapless - you're living on the edge of being completely exposed. </p>
<p><strong>Chasing the Dream</strong></p>
<p>I think chasing dreams is sexy;  even if the process, as exposed in this book, is definitely not.  So I'm cheering all those buried dreams!  The truth is, they're never really buried - they're always kind of there, right?  I’m living proof that it’s never too late to make your dreams come true! </p>
<p>I hope you too, find those old dreams and polish them off; even if it takes 17 years!  Actually, the number of years doesn't matter because time can't be measured linearly,  Instead, by diving into the messy middle, we are expanding our emotional capacity to make more space to move into those dreams.  That is a more nuanced process than a chronological timeline.  <br/><br/>So why did I want to do all this? I want to live like I write in my poem: <strong>”I want to be just a little bit dangerous,</strong>“ ”I want to paint my fingernails in my real desire,” and “walk like I just picked an apple off a tree I grew myself and ate it whole — red skin seed and all.”<br/> </p>

<h3>What and Who you are backing</h3>
<p>1. <strong>WHAT</strong>: The copyright to my poetry.

The Dream of Strapless 
In 2020, I burned it all down to write poetry. I left a 22-year-long career in high-tech. Burning it down means I can still feel the heat from the flames, and hear the crackle of the fire. It is all very much still alive. It’s uncomfortable peeling off the day-job identity among other layers. But I'm learning to sit with it and ask myself the hard questions.  I would love to share what that's like in my new book of poetry.  Hi, my name is Neelam Patel and I believe in a world where vulnerability is regarded with the same respect as logic, so we all can show up as whole, and really connect instead of constantly missing each other in plain sight.  In my new book Strapless, I’ll explore the intersection between vulnerability, shame, and self acceptance. I found there’s no jolting force to empowerment; it’s a retreat. It was the acceptance of all the colors of my feelings that led me into myself. 
My collection of poetry is not about the before and after of a hero's journey. I remained curious about the messy middle. I’m learning that’s where the light is. It’s not at the end of the tunnel. It’s right here, in the messy, complicated middle.I became tired of the simple Instagram-scrubbed stories that went from “I used to be so ashamed of X” to “Now that I’m a grown adult, I'm empowered..”  Those statements caused some level of shame,- or, in clearer terms: the feeling of ""I should already be healed and in a different emotional place than I am"". And that's pretty heavy, because it's shame about the shame, which traps us inside of ourselves.  So, the questions I ask in this book are: Isn't the middle-ground where we are all actually living in, empowered or otherwise?  And if so, then how do I make room for all of that?  
My hope for this collection is that others will feel less alone in their own honest feelings and take the steps to share them with a trusted friend — it is in the sharing that we release their power and we stop hiding our parts so we can create bonds that really hold us together in this wide world.  
You will enjoy this book if you want to go into the deep world of the Heroine’s Journey where she dives into herself, and where she lives in order to experience living, and takes sheer delight in it. 
This book is raw and vulnerable, like the feeling when you wear something strapless - you're living on the edge of being completely exposed. 
Chasing the Dream
I think chasing dreams is sexy;  even if the process, as exposed in this book, is definitely not.  So I'm cheering all those buried dreams!  The truth is, they're never really buried - they're always kind of there, right?  I’m living proof that it’s never too late to make your dreams come true! 
I hope you too, find those old dreams and polish them off; even if it takes 17 years!  Actually, the number of years doesn't matter because time can't be measured linearly,  Instead, by diving into the messy middle, we are expanding our emotional capacity to make more space to move into those dreams.  That is a more nuanced process than a chronological timeline.  So why did I want to do all this? I want to live like I write in my poem: ”I want to be just a little bit dangerous,“ ”I want to paint my fingernails in my real desire,” and “walk like I just picked an apple off a tree I grew myself and ate it whole — red skin seed and all.”

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Story of My Book</span></h3>
<p><i>Contrary to Conception</i> explores the real stories of people using contraception. Fearful myths and clouded understanding surround contraception from its historical beginnings to its biological processes. This book is aimed to unveil the inner workings of the various methods to help readers understand healthy motivations and scenarios associated with choosing and experiencing contraception.</p>
<p>---<br/><br/>My name is Madee Pasimio, DDS, and I am the author of <i>Contrary to Conception</i>. I wrote this book because no one talks about how they chose their contraceptive method, yet the typical family unit in America has two parents and two children...something is going on here! In school, we are required to take mandatory sexual education classes, yet these classes generally leave our students feeling awkward and ashamed. Throughout this journey, I have come across numerous accounts of people afraid of inopportune pregnancies who had to learn about contraception by either asking their friends what they use or consulting random internet articles. If we don’t have a family member, friend, or healthcare professional to rely on, how can we feel confident about the decision we are making? If we experience changes in our bodies, how do we know if our experience is normal?<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will learn how the different contraceptive methods work by reading the stories of people using different contraceptive methods. You’ll learn how these drugs and devices look and feel for people like you.<br/><br/>With this book, I want to invite those with a uterus to take ownership of your health, get the most out of your contraceptive choice, and thrive in your particular lifestyle. For those without a uterus, I want to show you how important this agenda is in educational and political spheres, while letting you in on the secret life of uteruses.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope to instill in all of you the same passionate vision I have for a world full of healthy bodies and healthy relationships.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll hear stories such as...</p>
<ul>
<li>How, before the pill, women were told by their doctors to sleep on the roof in order to prevent pregnancy.</li>
<li>How a worried teen without resources struggled to gain access to birth control.</li>
<li>How male partners can share in some of the burden.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you have questions about your current contraception experience, are unsure how to help another (a patient, child, or friend) in their contraception decision, or just have an interest in how the reproductive rights landscape emerged.<br/><br/><i>Contrary to Conception</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to those taking contraception and those questioning how to help others in their decision in a new way.</p>

This research project intends to discuss cosplay both inside and outside of the fan convention setting through social scientific methods. The goal is to garner a better understanding of the playful performance of identity which comes along with the embodiment of stories.</p><p> </p><p><strong>The Research Itself</strong></p><p>Cosplayers I know personally, and elsewhere, have noted that the process through which they choose the next character as a process of finding characters who have attributes they wish they had themselves. They see connections to fiction, and through the embodiment of narrative and character they can embody an identity that is both theirs and someone else’s.</p><p>The research will be primarily guided by an interest in the way the cosplayer’s identity plays a role in the act of cosplay itself. I’m interested in how the cosplay process unfolds, from the choices made in the character, to the way the emulation is sought. I’m interested in what it feels like to be in the attire, and how the cosplayer embodies popular culture during their act of dressing.</p><p>The research will follow social scientific methods, primarily focused on both questionnaires and detailed in-depth individual interviews. The results will be published in both the full book at the end, as well as journal articles published in academic journals.</p><p>I intend to explore how cosplay is an act of embodiment.

This research project intends to discuss cosplay both inside and outside of the fan convention setting through social scientific methods. The goal is to garner a better understanding of the playful performance of identity which comes along with the embodiment of stories. The Research ItselfCosplayers I know personally, and elsewhere, have noted that the process through which they choose the next character as a process of finding characters who have attributes they wish they had themselves. They see connections to fiction, and through the embodiment of narrative and character they can embody an identity that is both theirs and someone else’s.The research will be primarily guided by an interest in the way the cosplayer’s identity plays a role in the act of cosplay itself. I’m interested in how the cosplay process unfolds, from the choices made in the character, to the way the emulation is sought. I’m interested in what it feels like to be in the attire, and how the cosplayer embodies popular culture during their act of dressing.The research will follow social scientific methods, primarily focused on both questionnaires and detailed in-depth individual interviews. The results will be published in both the full book at the end, as well as journal articles published in academic journals.I intend to explore how cosplay is an act of embodiment. In the act of dressing in costume as a character from fiction, the participant actively engages in a playful preformative act of identity transformation.I have always been interested in storytelling, and the complicated ways stories are told and engaged with in the world. Stories are not just read. They are interacted with, played with, and embodied. Cosplay demonstrates just how complicated the engagement with stories can be, and how these stories can impact our understanding of self and the world around us. The ImpactThere are very few, if any, detailed explorations into the world of cosplay which take the community as serious and important to our contemporary social world.I have had successful research projects giving importance and dignity to popular culture subgroups, including my PhD at Durham University. With the project, I intend to step away a bit from the academic world to give the cosplay community a greater role and contribution within the project itself.My contributions will not be completely outside the academic world, however, and I hope the project can extend into more formal academic outputs to give greater attention to the world of cosplay to new arenas. About MeMy name is Vivian Asimos, and I’m a researcher in the study of popular culture.

<p><strong>The Background</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In autumn 1914, hundreds of thousands of men were engaged in a death struggle in Flanders in an attempt to break through and end a conflict that threatened to last for months, even years. Facing the might of the German armies that had steam-rollered through Belgium were the French and their allies from Britain and India – with millions more from across the Dominions of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa waiting to join the fight.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At sea, the Royal Navy, the strength of the British nation, ploughed through heavy seas to defend its shores and to engage in some of the fiercest naval battles of the war.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On land, this was the birth of trench warfare; the beginning of the Western Front and of No-Man’s Land; the first creation of the mud-scenes we have come to associate with the Great War. As winter approached, soldiers from India and Britain struggled in mud-filled trenches, while professional military nurses worked to save the lives of the wounded.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>These were dark days. And acting as a beacon of light there was HRH Princess Mary, only daughter of King George V. She would grow an idea that would mean so much to those at war.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She would provide a Christmas Gift for ‘every sailor afloat, every soldier at the front’. And it was a gift that was given to all, regardless of ‘race, gender or creed’.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Set against the backdrop of the Christmas Truce of 1914, this is her story, the story of the Gift, and the story of the men and women who received it.</p>

Princess Mary’s Christmas Gift, 1914
I am an historian and author interested in the experience of the British army in the world wars. Trench warfare has always fascinated me, and much meaning can be drawn from the objects, letters and other artefacts of the war.
 
Most of previous books have told the story of the British soldier at war from this perspective, illustrated by the words of the participants, and the objects that they handled, used and collected. And this approach holds true for the offer made to you here.
 
And this book, truly and for the first time ever, tells the full story of Princess Mary’s Christmas Gift, 1914.
 
It is a rich story, a complex story, and one that touched the lives of at least 2.6 million people from across Britain and its then Empire.  And is a story that very much resonates today.
 
It is a story that deserves to be told; and you can help me tell it.
 

The Background
 
In autumn 1914, hundreds of thousands of men were engaged in a death struggle in Flanders in an attempt to break through and end a conflict that threatened to last for months, even years. Facing the might of the German armies that had steam-rollered through Belgium were the French and their allies from Britain and India – with millions more from across the Dominions of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa waiting to join the fight.
 
At sea, the Royal Navy, the strength of the British nation, ploughed through heavy seas to defend its shores and to engage in some of the fiercest naval battles of the war.
 
On land, this was the birth of trench warfare; the beginning of the Western Front and of No-Man’s Land; the first creation of the mud-scenes we have come to associate with the Great War. As winter approached, soldiers from India and Britain struggled in mud-filled trenches, while professional military nurses worked to save the lives of the wounded.
 
These were dark days. And acting as a beacon of light there was HRH Princess Mary, only daughter of King George V. She would grow an idea that would mean so much to those at war.
 
She would provide a Christmas Gift for ‘every sailor afloat, every soldier at the front’. And it was a gift that was given to all, regardless of ‘race, gender or creed’.
 
Set against the backdrop of the Christmas Truce of 1914, this is her story, the story of the Gift, and the story of the men and women who received it.

 
What you will  get
 
Type ‘Princess Mary’s Christmas Gift’ into Google and you will see any number of sites, blogs and posts that refer to the Gift. But truly none of these get to the root of the Gift, what it contained, and how it was received.
 
This is the first time in over a hundred years that the full story of Princess Mary’s Gift has been told, based on two-years of extensive archive research.
 
Lavishly illustrated in full colour over 352 pages and using original artefacts, archive records, letters and newspaper reports, For Every Sailor Afloat, Every Soldier at the Front’ gives you the facts and tells you the full story.
 
The book provides:

For the first time, the words and impressions of Princess Mary herself;
The full story of the Gift Fund as it unfolded in 1914, based on its archives and an extensive survey of newspaper archives from across Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand;

<p><i>Gratitude: A Work in Progress</i> is about the stories and my learnings I obtained during my journey of writing 365 thank you notes in a year. Based on my experience, and many other gratitude practitioners' stories, I devised a five phase framework for developing and deploying gratitude in a personal, educational, and business context.<br/><br/>My name is, Austen Brower, and I am the author of <i>Gratitude: A Work in Progress</i>. I wrote this book because of all the conflict, fear, and anger that has surfaced in the past few years. Specifically with COVID-19 and the election cycle taking a toll on our collective wellbeing. I felt it paramount to put something positive in the world. My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover consistently applying gratitude is simple, yet, results in a profound impact. <br/><br/>In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for gratitude. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you apply consistent gratitude in your personal, educational, or business environment by adopting the 5 phases of a gratitude ecosystem.<br/><br/>As you read this book, I hope that you will learn about the state of gratitude, my five phase gratitude ecosystem framework, and deploying gratitude in your life. You'll hear stories such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>A conversation with Dr. Amit Kumar and how his research quantified the paradox of giving gratitude. People know it is really good to send thank you letters, but find it difficult to do.</li>
<li>How a bike theft became a supreme example of gratitude's power.</li>
<li>How Chris Murchison applies gratitude within his company to boost morale, productivity, and community.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you are interested in reframing your life through gratitude, applying gratitude in an organizational setting, or enjoy reading uplifting stories.</p>

Andy wants everyone to focus on our common humanity and to be open to our differences. She meets an unexpected challenge when Carina Maki moves in next door.

Risks & Challenges

<p>Excerpt:</p>
<p>I used to think that cancer was my biggest fear, until I realized my fear turned into cancer.</p>
<p>I was in so much pain. My chest was hurting, heart broken, emotionally exhausted and alone. I was frustrated and out of control. The previous months had been the hardest of my life. It seemed like everything had come crashing down. Every relationship I had was being tested, my work was unfulfilling and I was unable to control my empathy. Anxiety, insomnia, depression: you name it, I claimed it. I had hit rock bottom, but hadn't I been here before? Several times before, but this time felt different. I was ready for change. I had always questioned my why and I prayed earnestly for my purpose to be revealed. His answer came in an unexpected manner.</p>
<p>As I walked through the dark valleys in the shadows of pain, heartbreak, and hurt, God walked with me. I began this journey, unaware of where it would lead me. I soon realized I had to take care of myself; physically, mentally and spiritually. Slowly, with guidance from my life coach, meditation and practicing self love, I began to heal. I began discovering, creating, loving myself, nourishing relationships. I was writing again, reflecting, rejuvenating, releasing, resting. I learned  to let go. Letting go can be hard. When you deal with anxiety you can let a myriad of questions torment you. When we focus on what is right in front of us, the reality of the present moment, you tend to remain calm. I would soon see the benefit of this mindset shift.</p>
<p>I was healing emotionally, and spiritually, however I began to experience some unfamiliar physical pain, which led me to visit a chiropractor. He issued a body x-ray and determined I had two pinched nerves. Subsequently, the chiropractor urged me to take my x-ray to my primary doctor because he saw something unfavorable. How divine was it that this chiropractor spent 30 years as a radiologist and knew what he saw in my x-rays? I went to the doctor, shared my x-rays which revealed concern of a cancerous mass in my abdomen and pelvis. A CT Scan was needed to rule that out. When the results came back it revealed the mass was consistent with kidney cancer. I remember when I got the news, things went blank. Between hyperventilating, screaming, dragging myself on the floor and vomiting, you would have thought I was a cartoon character! The one thing that I have always feared was cancer. This is when I gained a strength that I never knew I had. I put faith over fear and was transformed that day! I had to get a biopsy and eventually remove the mass on my kidney. There was a small pelvic lesion that could possibly be where the cancer had spread. A recommendation for an MRI and a visit with the oncologist were my next steps.</p>
<p>I now know God had been preparing me for this journey all along. As each day passed I continued working on managing my emotions and communicating my needs. Surprisingly, what I had not experienced yet was fear. No matter what the doctors told me I knew our sickness does not end in death because healing is in heaven. No spirit of fear shall prosper.</p>
<p>The morning of my bone biopsy, I fretted about the pain. “My peace I leave with you, peace I give unto you Deidre.” All I had to do was just listen to God's word and obey. I began to cry and pant lying in the frigid hospital bed, dreading the procedure. The nurse questioned my tears. “There’s a mass on my kidney and I need this bone biopsy to be sure nothing is spreading.” I sobbed. He assumed the diagnosis had me upset. I quickly cut him off , “I'm not upset about my diagnosis. It’s the big needle you're about to put in my bone!” I was afraid of the pain that I hadn't even experienced and God said,“My peace I give unto you.” I relished on that thought for a moment. Before I knew it, I was settled, but not soon enough. The nurse looked at me, “I'm going to give you a little something for anxiety.” A chill pill. “I leave you with my peace.” After receiving the calming Ativan and a brief discussion about the position I was to lay in… Nothing. I remember nothing. No pain! “My peace.” I woke up in recovery! Did they even do the biopsy? “The peace I give is a gift the world cannot give.” When He said it, I listened! The entire time, I was at peace. When the biopsy results came in, I was ready! As soon as I got the notification I told Adonica and she began to cry. I said, “What are you crying for? Let's pray.” Immediately I began, “Thank You Lord. No matter what the results are, I have peace, grace and mercy on my side.” Turns out there were rare atypical cells on my bone that's not cancerous and needs no further testing. Next came the partial nephrectomy, or kidney removal in layman's terms.</p>

I used to think that cancer was my biggest fear, until I realized my fear turned into cancer.
I was in so much pain. My chest was hurting, heart broken, emotionally exhausted and alone. I was frustrated and out of control. The previous months had been the hardest of my life.

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<i>Misfit</i> is a book about heart-touching stories and events, controversial traditions, social values, and unpopular opinions and choices. The book explores interesting topics such as love, money, traditions, family, immigrant life, etc., and reflects on things that are not going in the right direction. It touches on self-exploration (re-visiting some low points and disheartening opinions, asking if it is ‘true’, loving yourself) and feminism (difference of perspective based on gender, the role of women, how it has evolved, where it seems to be going), but is not just about that; the segmentation of chapters is far deeper in meaning and enriched with reasons. <br/><br/>My name is Shruti Mishra and I am the author of <i>Misfit</i>. I wrote this book in search of answers to my questions that were shut down with a controversial or ‘it has always been like that’ tag. I, myself, have either been labeled or made to feel different in many aspects of my life. Living in that question-filled world gave me the nudge to start the journey, and completing it gave me the answers I sought, a sense of purpose in speaking up about the issues, and a fulfilling journey.  <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover your own voice, seek interest in learning about various aspects of human life, and find deep love and understanding for fellow misfits. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for love, inclusion, compassion, progression, and humanity. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you feel supported (if you feel like a misfit) or understand the world of misfits (if you are an ally).<br/><br/>In this book, you'll read stories, check the facts, and self-reflect on answers to questions such as: <ul>
<li>Not everything is always a choice. Is it? </li>
<li>Why do we find it hard to accept most people as they are? </li>
<li>How much should one inherit from the past? </li>
<li>How much do we speculate about others? Is it true or right? </li>
<li>What are the true reasons behind feeling like a misfit? </li>
<li>Have I ever done this to someone else? </li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you love to connect with others on a deeper level, feel passionate about social progressions in the right direction, and have ever felt like a misfit yourself.<br/><br/><i>Misfit</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to youngsters, women, immigrants, and social activists who want to look at society, traditions, and the world in a new way.<br/> </p>
<h3>The Book - Misfit </h3>
<p>The book is written in 3 parts.<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the introduction + chapters 1-5. This part of the book will allow you to dig deeper into yourself and understand how various aspects of your life are shaped by others. You will get to know me, the author, through some of my stories and perhaps reflect with me on similar or shared instances of life. This section will help show the difference between just a person and a human with emotions, desires, dreams, ambitions, and knowledge. <br/><br/>Part 2 contains chapters 6-9. This section of the book is dedicated to learning about the intersection of individuals and society. You will recognize and acknowledge how the idea of others shape us and our view of everything, how our surrounding instills irrational and binding fears in our minds, and how we mostly get wrapped up in other’s choices.<br/><br/>Part 3 contains chapters 10-13 + conclusion. These last few chapters will give a holistic view of some of the most controversial and talked out topics/themes of modern times and how they relate to making individuals or demographics feel out of place. If you have questions such as, “have things always been the same?”, “how indulging is the technological world?”, “is home really where the heart is?”, and “how crazy is the monetary impact on us?”, then reading this section might feel like nirvana for your brain. <br/> </p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<ul>

<li>The cover design of my book. (The mockups you see currently are a placeholder!)</li>

<li>The copy editing for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.</li>
<li>The launch &amp; promotion efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this Winter.</li>
</ul>
<br/>When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish a paperback and ebook. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover edition and an audiobook.<br/><br/><br/>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:<ul>

<p>Shruti Mishra is a recent college grad who is pursuing her passion for consumer insights and behavioral science at MOD. Shruti, an international student from Nepal, is gregarious, innately curious, determined, and futurist thinking. <br/><br/>She started her journey of writing her first book, <i>Misfit</i>, in a search to find answers to questions that were shut down with a controversial tag and ended up creating a book that serves more purpose than originally intended. Misfit can be a shelter, a shoulder, a guidebook, a self-help book, a conversation starter, and more than anything, an eye-opening read. Shruti is curious about changing human perceptions and increasing social compassion among people by adding her perspective to these topics through her book. <br/><br/>Being as outspoken and extroverted as she is, Shruti loves making new friends and spending quality time with friends and family.

If you are outside the US, please send me a private message/email and I will guide you through the international preorders process. Also, thank you for your support!  
Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by including the cost of mailing and shipping the signed copies into each pre-order tier. The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we ship the pre-order rewards to you as early as possible. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as to when my book will publish. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship. 
Other Ways You Can HelpSome people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:
Please share my pre-sale campaign on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn with your friends, family, and network. Please follow my book page (@misfits_power), use #misfits_power, and tag me as well as my publisher, New Degree Press, so that we can help amplify your efforts.
You can easily share my pre-sale campaign via Indiegogo at the top of the page.
Please share my book with 5 friends, family members, or co-workers who you think would enjoy it via text or direct message on social media.

<p><i>The New Middle</i> explores the journey we can all take to find those inspirational moments when we need it most: during periods of disagreements.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">---</p>
<p>My name is Bryant Galindo and I am the author of <i>The New Middle: Using Heart and Mind to Collaboratively Disagree.</i><br/><br/>I wrote this book because we need new ways of communicating. From our workplaces, to our everyday life, to our political conversations, <strong>we must learn how to respectfully disagree and collaborate with someone we may not agree with. </strong>It is then that we will be able to tackle and solve some of the most pressing problems we face in our world.<br/><br/><i>The New Middle</i> is a promise and a roadmap for accomplishing this.<br/><br/><strong>This book will help you gain that unwavering understanding of how to magically turn conflict in both your workplace and personal life into opportunities for more growth, greater connection, and new collaborative solutions</strong>.<br/><br/><i>The New Middle</i> is a blend of conflict resolution, psychology, and spirituality as it applies to communication. I infuse storytelling throughout because, to be frank, I didn't want to write another boring how-to book. The book starts with my own story that led me on this journey, my near-death stabbing experience, and how that led me to open my own heart and learn heart-mind communication skills.<br/><br/>Similarly, you'll also hear stories on:</p>
<ul>
<li>How a multi-million dollar education tech company found a compromise to their equity restructuring negotiation when the Chief Innovation Officer dropped her ego and accessed her heart. </li>
<li>How a co-founder team discovered that one of their own was in a mental health crisis, ultimately avoiding additional calamity through a communication reboot that got them out of their heads.</li>
<li>How a half-dozen conflict resolution practitioners in the field use silence, curiosity, and other tools to facilitate agreements in family-business disputes, commercial mediations, conflict coaching, and more. </li>
</ul>
</div><p><br/>While The New Middle is a nonfiction book for business leaders, conflict resolution specialists, personal development enthusiasts, civic leaders, individuals who want to make the world a better place, and anyone who desires to understand how to create lasting and sustainable change, it has something for everyone. Moreover, since it's about optimizing our communication skills for the 21st century, we could all benefit from the book's subject matter.<br/><br/><strong>I hope that this book will instill the same passion and excitement I have for creating connection and collaboration when we need it most: during periods of intense disagreement</strong>.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">---</p><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1627753937/uwe9cflbbeesksd7miav.png"" src=""""/></h3><p>For international preorders, please do the following:</p><ul>

Thank you all for the tremendous support! 
I raised 100% of my goal within two weeks. 
After speaking with my publisher, I will be going for a stretch goal of $7,500. That will allow me to also publish The New Middle as an audiobook version.  
Because of all the quick support too, The New Middle was highlighted as a popular project by Indiegogo on their Homepage.
I've had orders come in from the United States, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, Chile, Australia, Peru, Argentina, Finland, Canada, Germany, and Mexico.
I'm beyond humbled and grateful. 
Thank you :)

The New Middle explores the journey we can all take to find those inspirational moments when we need it most: during periods of disagreements.
---
My name is Bryant Galindo and I am the author of The New Middle: Using Heart and Mind to Collaboratively Disagree.I wrote this book because we need new ways of communicating. From our workplaces, to our everyday life, to our political conversations, we must learn how to respectfully disagree and collaborate with someone we may not agree with. It is then that we will be able to tackle and solve some of the most pressing problems we face in our world.The New Middle is a promise and a roadmap for accomplishing this.This book will help you gain that unwavering understanding of how to magically turn conflict in both your workplace and personal life into opportunities for more growth, greater connection, and new collaborative solutions.The New Middle is a blend of conflict resolution, psychology, and spirituality as it applies to communication. I infuse storytelling throughout because, to be frank, I didn't want to write another boring how-to book. The book starts with my own story that led me on this journey, my near-death stabbing experience, and how that led me to open my own heart and learn heart-mind communication skills.Similarly, you'll also hear stories on:

How a multi-million dollar education tech company found a compromise to their equity restructuring negotiation when the Chief Innovation Officer dropped her ego and accessed her heart. 
How a co-founder team discovered that one of their own was in a mental health crisis, ultimately avoiding additional calamity through a communication reboot that got them out of their heads.
How a half-dozen conflict resolution practitioners in the field use silence, curiosity, and other tools to facilitate agreements in family-business disputes, commercial mediations, conflict coaching, and more. 

While The New Middle is a nonfiction book for business leaders, conflict resolution specialists, personal development enthusiasts, civic leaders, individuals who want to make the world a better place, and anyone who desires to understand how to create lasting and sustainable change, it has something for everyone. Moreover, since it's about optimizing our communication skills for the 21st century, we could all benefit from the book's subject matter.I hope that this book will instill the same passion and excitement I have for creating connection and collaboration when we need it most: during periods of intense disagreement.---For international preorders, please do the following:
Identify the perk that interests you, e.g. 1 or 2 paperbacks
Select the pink ""Back it"" button to ""Make a contribution"" for the same amount (this choice bypasses the shipping address page)
Use this Google Form to share your mailing address, so I can calculate the international shipping costs and invoice you for that amount via PayPal/Venmo
---I have written this book to be read in its entirety as a journey. But you can also read the book in sections:Section 1 is on trauma and your upbringing, looking at how unconscious behaviors and triggers create a communication pattern based on five different communication styles: the fighter, the avoider, the peacemaker, the compromiser, and the collaborator.  Section 2 is on the mind and how our fight, flight, or freeze responses get us stuck when we are in periods of disagreement, including what it looks like when we use our mind healthily in conflict.  Section 3 is on the heart, why we close up and disengage to avoid pain, and how to keep it open when triggers pop up, creating more heart-based communication. Section 4 is the genesis of this book, which is how, with a balanced heart-mind, we can work with individuals we disagree with to find solutions to pressing problems, resulting in more collaborative disagreements. ---This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:
The editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in December 2021.
The cover design of my book (the mockups you see currently are a placeholder).
The layout design for the interior of my book (physical copy, ebook formats).
The copyediting for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.
The launch & promotion efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this winter.
 The following are the tiers I need to reach to be successful:  I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:
You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish.
A personal, handwritten thank-you not for pre-ordering my book.
Your name will appear in the special acknowledgments section of my book.
Early access to the introduction and my entire manuscript, with the opportunity to review it and give me early feedback.
The opportunity to help give me feedback and be involved in selecting my cover.
An invitation to join my Beta Reader Community.
And more...
---Bryant Galindo is a mediator and consultant who works with business founders and teams to resolve partnership disagreements and teams negotiations. Specifically, he has helped facilitate agreements to equity restructuring deals, business dissolution matters, and breach of contract claims in the millions of dollars range with clients worldwide through his business, CollabsHQ. After a near-death stabbing experience a few years ago, Bryant began working with a teacher in Los Angeles named Suzanne, who guided him in understanding what it meant to live with an open heart. This book would not be possible without her. For the first time in his life, he understood that emotions and anything “heart” related were not concepts relegated to just the female gender, but also sources of empowerment that all humans could access. As he healed from that experience and started his business, he combined his conflict resolution background with his new spiritual practices he was learning. Bryant built his business around this, sparking connection and collaboration during the negotiations he facilitated.Bryant holds a Master of Science in Negotiation and Conflict Resolution from Columbia University. He has facilitated and resolved commercial, business, and employment disputes, and has worked with the United Nations, Union Bank, and the University of Phoenix to create large-scale communication and conflict resolution training. He calls Los Angeles, CA home and you can connect with Bryant at bryant@collabshq.com as well as on LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter.---The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing/shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies are expected to ship.---I also understand that not everyone can contribute financially, and that's okay. Here are some ways you can still support me: 
Please share my pre-sale campaign on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn with your friends, family, and network. Please use #TheNewMiddle and tag me as well as my publisher, New Degree Press, so we can help amplify your efforts. 
You can easily share my Pre-Sale Campaign Page via Indiegog at the top of the page.

<h3>FROM THE AUTHOR:</h3>
<p>I have personally experienced and witnessed how both running and reading can change lives. From the children we have fostered and parented, to the over 100 people I have interviewed on the Runified Podcast, I am constantly amazed by the intrinsic power running and other sports have on the human spirit and communities. This is why I wrote <i>My Mommy Runs</i> and published it two years ago with the help of almost 200 people.</p>
<p><strong>I invite you to click the pink BACK IT button and/or select a perk to help make our second book, <i>My Daddy Runs</i>, a reality.</strong></p>
<p>The book is nearly complete, including amazing illustrations by Andrew Langston. Page numbers are hidden in the illustrations to serve as an additional way to interact with the book.</p>
<p>Thank you for visiting this campaign and please consider backing at any level you feel comfortable with. Moreover, please share this project with others.</p>
<p>Please see details below about how to get *free* books!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>ABOUT THE AUTHOR AND ILLUSTRATOR:</h3>
<p><i>My Daddy Runs</i> is Matt Sorenson's second children's book, following <i>My Mommy Runs</i>. Matt is also the author of peer-reviewed scientific articles, thousands of unintelligible text and emails, and a 209 page PhD dissertation. How do these things qualify him to be a children’s book author? They don’t. But recognizing a need that a lot of people had, working with others to create a solution, and humbly asking hundreds of questions to experienced experts does qualify him to attempt making a positive impact in this world through simple but thoughtful children’s books.</p>
<p>Comic book artist Andrew Langston meanwhile claims the illustrator credit... Why? Comic book artists don’t illustrate children’s books! What sort of topsy-turvy world do we live in? Well, we live in a world where Matt asked his friend Lindsey to illustrate the book <i>My Mommy Runs</i>, but she didn’t want to. So then she asked her neighbor Andrew if he’d like to do it instead. Dream come true, right? What’s particularly amazing is that Andrew initially didn’t take it seriously, and his first draft of the character design for the main character took about 2 minutes to draw, and that character design didn’t end up changing much from the first draft to the final product in all honesty. But that hardly matters, since the main point of art is to elicit emotion, whether that be positive, negative, or introspective. For this book and <i>My Mommy Runs</i>, the art is meant to represent whimsicalness, nostalgia, and family connections. So, if you feel those emotions reading the book, that means that the illustrations are functional, and for a comic book artist like Andrew, that was the goal all along.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>THE NEED:</h3>
<p>$7,000 will allow us to:</p>

<p><i>My Mommy Runs</i> Books: Each hardcover book will be signed by the author.</p>
<p>Name in Acknowledgements: Certain perks give you the opportunity to have your name, your family's name, your company's name, or someone else's name included in the <i>My Daddy Runs</i> book! Backers will be asked by email how they want their name(s) to appear after the campaign has ended.</p>

<h3>THE IMPACT: </h3>
<p>World peace and an end to world hunger. We wish.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES: </h3>
<p>The world might end. In this case, the book won’t be sent.</p>
<p>But seriously, the book has already been written, illustrated, designed, is being prepared for printing and publication. The most significant challenge will be printing and receiving the books in a timely manner. Almost all printers have significant demands and delays, but the books should be complete by the end of 2021.</p>

<h3>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP: </h3>

While I’d initially set out to write a memoir, a key piece was missing. What was supposed to be an interview with a stranger to gather supporting information for my arguments turned into a two-hour conversation about feeling inadequate, experiencing a loss of faith, and exploring childhood trauma. I left the interview knowing that my book would actually represent my journey to a place of clarity; I needed to find out who I was and how I related to the world around me. That is why one intimate conversation turned into twenty-two that contributed lessons, tools, motivations, excitements, fears, creations, and nuances that reminded me healing was an interconnected process. </p><p>Many of us have had moments in our lives that have felt like coming home to ourselves. Few people can expand on this feeling and see that human beings thrive from connections at their core. As somebody that has always been quite introverted, exploring these human relationships has made me more accepting of myself. When we create a space for connection without judgment, the sky is the limit for what can be bred from such interactions.</p><p>For one, they can inspire a book.</p><p>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will reflect upon the life experiences that have brought you until this point and view them as your personal power and purpose. With my story and those of 22 others, I hope to instill in you the inner peace and confidence to make sense of confusing, disorderly moments in life. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a collection of tools to help you in moments of uncertainty with yourself and others.</p><p>As part of these chapters, you’ll hear stories such as: </p><ul>
<li>Eva’s, whose bipolar disorder episode caused her to be accused of a crime that she’s still on trial for, but in the process has lost her family. Her story shows us how life can sometimes bring moments that are not only hard because they change the world we knew, but because they alter the self we knew.</li>
<li>Mike’s, who was given six months left to live but survived his kidney disease diagnosis and found the inspiration to start a new company, Happy Plate. His story teaches us that we have the power to restructure the ties between the events that occur in our life. </li>
<li>Nisha’s, who went through years of peeling back the layers to her childhood trauma and first memories of gender exploration to discover who she was. Her story is more than one of gender—it is a story of someone becoming the most authentic version of themselves. </li>
</ul><p><i>The Energized Self: Explorations of Inner Peace to Foster Self-Awareness, Compassion &amp; Service</i> is a book for anyone who wants to understand themselves better. You will love this book if you are someone who enjoys storytelling as a way to kickstart self-reflection and a bigger-picture mentality. This book is for anyone who is curious about what’s on the other side of discomfort. While these stories outline individual experiences, they resonate with universal feelings.</p><h2>The Book </h2><p>The book is written in 3 parts.</p><p>I've structured this book into my essential components for a total sense of wellbeing. I present these as the <i>Me</i>, <i>They</i>, and <i>We</i>. First, we look within and try to build a strong foundation of self.

Fostering compassion for others will enable us to practice service in any way that comes naturally to us. </p><p><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the introduction + chapters 1-6. In this section, you will read about my journey to self-discovery: how I approached loving myself and healing my trauma with narrative therapy. These chapters don’t sugarcoat how difficult but rewarding the act of self-reflection could be.</p><p><strong>Part 2 </strong>contains chapters 7-13. In this section, you will hear from fourteen individuals about their experiences overcoming issues from low self-worth to the murder of a family member. This section promotes the prioritization of self, and offers tips and tricks for better self-reflection. </p><p><strong>Part 3</strong> contains chapters 14-20.

Tako da je to s pivom ispalo malo promašeno.U svakom slučaju – budući da je 15 novaca zbilja sitna lova, tko želi pomoći s 60 – samo naprijed, cijenim to, ekspedicija ima troškove.... a što se piva tiče, lako se dogovorimo.250 evra – Big PictureLovatori i oni koji vole umjetnost – ne znam kako će se pogledati u ogledalo ako ne uzmu ovaj jaki perk... uspješni startupi, njihovi pokretači, investitori, vlasnici iPhonea, kapitalisti, neoliberali, paleoanarhisti, ljubitelji Tesli, mrzitelji Tesli, poduzetnici, saborski zastupnici, socijalisti, kriminalci.... a svih njih ima među mojim frendovima....

<p>Here, let me break down what I need and where your money is going.</p>
<p>My novel has gone through several rounds of beta readers, and many rewrites, but there are still things that need to be completed, outside of writing, to give the book a chance at being successful.</p>
<p>Here is a list of those things:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Editor</strong> - The book still needs a professional copy edit and proofread.</li>
<li>
<strong>Cover</strong> - The book still needs a professional cover artist to design and produce a cover that can convey the right genre, as well as make it stand out.</li>
<li>
<strong>Formatting</strong> - The book must be formatted for print and various eBook platforms.</li>
<li><strong>ISBN numbers and fees</strong></li>
<li>
<strong>Marketing</strong> for the book (ads, book deal sites, ARCs, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>All money I raise of my goal will go directly toward this.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Any money raised over my goal will go toward:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>ARC</strong>s (advanced reader copies) for reviewers</li>
<li>
<strong>Marketing</strong> and ads (so that I can market the book to as many potential readers as possible and find its audience).</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>If there is anything left over after paying for the edit, cover, formatting, ARCs, and marketing, I have some cool ideas for stretch goals that I will reveal! Anything on top of that I will put toward my next book, which I hope to release later this year.</p>
<p>If I do not reach my goal all the money raised will go toward the edit. The most important thing is that the book be as good as it can be and a good copy edit is paramount to that. If I do not raise enough for a professional cover I will have to go with a cheaper option or possibly design it myself. If this occurs I may also have to format the book myself, which isn't easy, but I can do it. This will all be more time consuming, and might not result in as clean a package.</p>
<p>I am already planning on paying for all the ISBN numbers, fees, and Author Platform costs (website, mailbox, newsletter, reader magnet, etc.) myself.</p>
<p>No matter what though, no matter how much is raised, the book will be published.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>

Specifically, he is working with trade partner companies and Turner employees to push the boundaries of what is possible regarding innovation in the workplace and on construction sites. He enjoys coaching teams to success through question-driven process improvement resulting in an overall better working environment. Michael's interest in process improvement and operational efficiency is rooted in his inquisitive nature and desire to change the way “we have always done things.” His experience optimizing human performance and driving personal growth found it's intersection with the similarities of the personal finance world, which later drove him to author this book. Michael spends most of his free time partaking in physical activities including triathlon and outdoor sports. The idea of writing a book was always something he pondered but with the on set of the pandemic, it drove him to action to execute this aspiration. The book came to life through engaging in social media interactions to drive content and employing his working skills of challenging the status quo that brought “Young, Educated and Broke” to life.

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<i>Towards Machine Literacy</i> is a book about AI at its best and worst: how AI systems can and will do incredible things, but why we need to be careful as we develop and use them. The book focuses on AI literacy, the simple act of understanding the abilities and limitations of AI systems, and being able to understand how those systems affect us today. <br/><br/>My name is Daniel Bashir and I am the author of Towards Machine Literacy. I wrote this book because while working on machine learning in academia and in the industry, I’ve been exposed to a number of questions about the ethical and societal consequences of AI. I’m convinced we need more voices in the conversation we’re having about this technology, and I wanted to explore these ideas and make them accessible to a broad audience. <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover AI literacy’s importance in today’s world. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for AI literacy. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you better understand how AI technologies affect us today and how we can ensure they have a positive impact in the future.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about current uses of AI and some of the ethical and societal quagmires those uses engender. You'll hear stories such as...<ul>
<li>How the field of AI started, with a paper by Alan Turing and a summer workshop at Dartmouth.</li>
<li>How one YouTube addict became radicalized—and eventually deradicalized himself—after diving down a rabbit hole of incendiary videos recommended to him by YouTube’s algorithm. </li>
<li>The governance of a real-life algorithm for matching kidneys to recipients. </li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you are interested in current technology, want to understand how technology impacts society, or are concerned about how advanced technologies might impact the lives we lead.<br/><br/><i>Towards Machine Literacy</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to the general public and technologists or policymakers who want to look at artificial intelligence and its impacts in a new way.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Book - Towards Machine Literacy</h2>
<p>The book is written in 5 parts.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the introduction + chapters 1-2. In this section, I’ll talk about how AI got where it is today, considering both the research advances and how practitioners and the public think about the field. We’ll talk about the famous summer at Dartmouth as well as how legislation tends to lag behind technology. <br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains chapters 3-5. This section on the principles of AI literacy will begin to unpack the important things to understand about AI systems today.  <br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> contains chapters 6-15. This section—the longest by far—dives into the pros and cons of many AI systems. We look at dilemmas about technologies like facial recognition and recommender systems, and how questions about making these systems better don’t have easy answers. <br/><br/><strong>Part 4</strong> contains chapters 16-18. In these three chapters, we look at specific ways we can develop AI literacy among groups like policymakers and students. At this point, you, the reader, will have developed your own literacy!<br/><br/><strong>Part 5</strong> contains chapters 19-20. The book’s finale will center around case studies on the governance of algorithms and AI systems. I’ll go into detail about pitfalls in the use of algorithmic and AI systems, and use examples to show how we can uncover these issues and prevent potential problems in the future. </p>

You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship. Other Ways You Can HelpPlease share my pre-sale campaign on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn with your friends, family and network. Please use #TheStoryTheyNeverTellUs and tag me as well as my publisher, New Degree Press, so we can help amplify your efforts.You can easily share my Pre-Sale Campaign Page via Indiegogo at the top of the page.Please share my book with 5 friends, family members, or co-workers who you think would enjoy it via text or direct message on social media.Thank you so much for of all of your love and support!Thanks again,Brenna Blaylock",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>""Nowhere is the dreamer or the misfit so alone . . .""</h3>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">When Neil Peart, drummer and lyricist of legendary rock band Rush, died on January 7, 2020, fans the world over expressed their grief and sadness. Neil's passing was more than just passing news: Fans felt like they <i>knew </i>him. They felt like they knew <i>all three </i>members of Rush . . .</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">. . . and now the band was definitively over.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I felt these same feelings, having been a Rush fan for over 20 years. Geddy, Alex, and Neil created a body of work that spoke to <i>me<i>, </i></i>and very often if felt like it spoke to <i>me specifically</i>. In reading tributes to Neil and the band after his death, I realized that <i>millions of other fans felt the same way</i>.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">My question was: Why? What was it about Rush fans that makes us respond so strongly to their music? Is there a Rush fan ""type""? Are the stereotypes about Rush fans being white middle-aged male nerds <i>true</i>? And most importantly: Why does this band mean so much to us?</span></p>
<p>So I decided to write a book about it. </p>
<p><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Alexander-Hellene/e/B07L9DKVPC"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">I'm a science-fiction author with two novels published</a>, but I decided to throw my hat into the non-fiction ring, put back on my historian's hat, and get to work. I interviewed people such as legendary DJ and media historian Donna Halper, who first broke the band in the U.S., and <a href=""https://amatopia.wordpress.com/2020/02/05/rush-survey-is-live/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">conducted a survey</a> gathering information and wonderful stories from hundreds of Rush fans. </p>
<p>This information and these stories are used in the book, and I really think I got an answer to my three primary questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is there a Rush fan type? If so, what is it?</li>
<li>Why did Neil Peart's death mean so much to so many people?</li>
<li>Why is there such a strong bond between Rush and their fans?</li>
</ol>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: 700;letter-spacing: 0px;"">What I Need &amp; What You Get</span></p>
</div><div>
<p>I want this book to be spectacular. Not just content-wise--it is, as you'll see. I want the whole package to be worthy of both the band and YOU, the fans. Self-publishing is rewarding, but expensive, and I front the costs myself. These include editing, formatting, and especially cover art.</p>
<p>I want my friend, excellent comics artist and Rush fan Jessie White, to paint the cover. He's ultra-talented and I know he'll do a bang-up job. He's excited to be a part of this project . . . but he also deserves to get paid. You can check out some of his work <a href=""https://whiteknightsillustration.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. </p>
<p>I'm looking to raise $2,000 to make this project a reality. The money will be spent as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>$1,500 for cover art</li>
<li>$250 for editing</li>
<li>$250 for formatting</li>
</ul>
<p>$2,000 is the minimum of what I need, but I do have some great stretch goals!</p>
<h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
<p><strong><u>$3,000</u>: </strong>If I can raise $3,000, my friend, artist extraordinaire <a href=""https://lolosart.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Manuel Guzman</a> will create interior illustrations for each chapter! Manuel is the author and illustrator of the storybook <a href=""https://lolosart.com/isos/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>In Search of Sacha</i></a>, as well as the cover artist for my books <i>The Last Ancestor</i> and <i>The Second Sojourn</i>. He's incredibly talented--check out his book <a href=""https://lolosart.com/isos/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a> and his art <a href=""https://lolosart.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. This will make the finished book even more spectacular.</p>
<p><strong><u>$3,200</u>:</strong> For another $200 more, Jessie White will create a two-page comic to accompany the book's intro.</p>
<p>As the campaign goes on, if I can think of any more stretch goals, I'll put them here. I'm also willing to hear ideas, so feel free to email!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This book is likely to happen regardless, but it won't be as awesome. Specifically, I am going to have to skimp on the cover, editing, and formatting. </p>
<p>I am willing and able to make this a reality, and have published two complete novels already with another ready to be released later this year. I'm a consistent writer and blogger and <i>always </i>carry through with my promise. </p>
<p>Your support will allow me to put a high-quality book in the hands of Rush fans all around the world, many of whom have written me expressing their eagerness to read <i>Dreamers and Misfits</i>. This isn't a cash grab, and it's not a vanity project. It's a serious, loving, and sometimes humorous project. I'm using both my training as an attorney and a historian to find sources, synthesize them, and construct arguments. I'm also using my musician's training and imagination to make sure it's well-written, informative, and most of all FUN. In other words, just like the band.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>My biggest hurdles are financial and personal. You see, I <i>personally </i>will feel like I'm short-changing Rush fans if I can't give them the best book money can buy. And much like Rush put an incredible amount of thought not just into their music but also into their artwork and album packaging, I want to do the same for <i>Dreamers and Misfits</i>.</p>
<p>Time is also a big challenge. If I can't raise enough money to pay Jesse, as well as my editor and formatter, it will take even longer to publish this book than the four months it's taken me to write it.</p>
<p>If I don't raise enough money, I will use what I did raise to defray some of the costs of publishing, but the book will likely be delayed and won't have as awesome of a cover. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute, please share this campaign with the Rush fan in your life who you think would love to be a part of this project! I appreciate as many eyeballs on my campaign and writing as possible!</p>
<p>You can also support by taking the survey! It's still open and there's still time to be <i>in </i>the book yourself!</p>

<p>You can buy current LotFP releases at the <a href=""http://www.lotfp.com/store/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LotFP Webstore</a>. Most of our releases are in the distribution chain, so you can get them at your local store, but the newer books (including the new Rules &amp; Magic) won't go to distribution until the Referee book is printed.</p>
<p>Which is why we're doing the crowdfunding push. Read on...<br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/21668/files/20130819113548-WhatsThisCampaignFor.jpg?1376937348"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The previous edition of LotFP (the ""Grindhouse Edition"") is just about sold out. We're out of copies at the LotFP headquarters, and there are few copies left in distribution. We need the core in print.</p>
<p>The Rules &amp; Magic book (basically the player book) has been printed and is on sale from the LotFP webshop in Finland, but the Ref book has not yet been printed so the new version of the game as a whole cannot yet go into the retail chain where it attracts new fans.</p>
<p>We could go to press right now effectively reprinting the Grindhouse Ref book as a hardcover, but that's not good enough. It needs the professional layout and presentation to match the Rules &amp; Magic book. And it could use some new art, additional editorial input, and all the great things that money can buy but that small publishers have problems financing out of pocket since they're not essential to the production of a book for it to still turn out pretty good.</p>
<p>So we here at LotFP hope you help to finance all of that and make this Ref book one that will both completely bury the previous editions of the book and be impressive enough to attract legions of new fans!</p>
<p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/21670/files/20130819113607-IAlreadyOwnBanner.jpg?1376937367"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p>
<p>It'll be in hardcover. More durable, more impressive. It will have fresh editing. It will have a professional layout to match the new Rules &amp; Magic book.</p>
<p>It will also have expanded content. LotFP is a living, growing game and so the advice in the book needs to be updated. But it will not replace the old advice, rather it will be presented alongside the previous advice in the book to highlight the fact that there is no one right way to play the game.</p>
<p>It will have a brand new section with tons of crunchy play aids, including a brand new creature generator (specializing in extra-dimensional mockeries of reality) with an expanded roster of sample monsters (but still no official game bestiary!), adventure generators, and all sorts of (hopefully) useful charts and tables to make adventure creation easier that will ensure that you keep this Ref book at hand when preparing your next session.</p>
<p>And of course there is new art, with Jason Rainville, Aeron Alfrey, and Eric Lofgren already having turned in new interior pieces (yes, a good pile of money has already been put into the project, this isn't all being done just on all your backs):</p>

<p>And exclusive to this campaign is the limited edition wraparound cover, by Yannick Bouchard:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/60151/files/20130908030915-bouchardcover.jpg?1378634955"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<b></b><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/21672/files/20130819113632-NonStandardBanner.jpg?1376937392"" src="""" style=""""/></p></span><span class=""notranlsate""><p>We're doing two things differently than traditional crowdfunding campaigns:</p>
<p><i>First, the Levels 3 - 5 Perks DO NOT INCLUDE SHIPPING COSTS.</i></p>
<p>What will happen is when the book is ready, you will receive a coupon code for the value of the Ref book (or two), and you will purchase it from the <a href=""http://www.lotfp.com/store/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LotFP Webstore</a>, paying the regular shipping costs at that time (and adding whatever other items you wish at the time).</p>
<p>Many crowdfunding campaigns, even ones that are on schedule, either wind up producing larger books than originally planned (which should be a good thing for everyone, right?) or the post office raises their rates between the time the campaign ends and fulfillment begins. It has turned seemingly profitable crowdfunding campaigns into a shipping cost grinder that causes the loss of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>The estimated weight that this Ref book + Death Frost Doom will be is 575g. Economy shipping for 575g in books would be 7,50€ according to current second-class rates. 1075g for both versions of the Ref book + Death Frost Doom would be 12,50€ to EU addresses and 15,00€ to non-EU addresses for second-class rates. But the book may be bigger. Or smaller. </p>
<p>But to the customer's advantage here, the extras will be added to those shipments at no added charge. And if we load up on stretch goals increasing the retail price of the book, Perk Levels 3-5 still get you the voucher for the full price based on your backing of the project here.</p>
<p>And then we can just add the value of any additional Stretch Goal Adventures to the voucher, and as each of those books is estimated to weigh about 75g, that would result in a 2,50€ shipping cost increase for non-EU residents if more than one stretch goal adventure is funded.</p>
<p>But again, those are all according to current postage rates, which may change at any time and we don't get much advance notice, and that's why we're not just adding 7,50€ to the cost of the perk levels and calling shipping costs covered.</p>
<p><i>Second, Extras bought will not automatically count towards stretch goals.<br/></i></p>Extra bits and stretch goals have also been a frequent financial killer of ""successful"" crowdfunding campaigns.<br/><br/>Publishers want to give you lots of cool stuff and extra tidbits. We really do. But this stuff costs money to produce. If you're running a campaign and you say the stretch goal for the next big improvement to the book is 2000€, and you get there because people bought 200 10€ fiddlydoos, and those fiddlydoos cost 5€ to produce... congratulations, you're on the hook for both the stretch goal improvements and the fiddlydoos, and you're down 1000€ out of pocket.<br/><br/>But I still want to offer stretch goals, and I still want to offer fiddlydoos.<br/><br/>So here's how we're going to do it.<br/><br/>Some of the extras have absolutely fixed costs. These are the Commentary, New Monsters, and Personalized Art extras. Half of each purchased extra will go towards the costs of the extra (paying talent!), the other half will go towards stretch goals.<br/><br/>Thulian Echoes will have half of each purchased extra go towards production costs for that adventure (its art budget in particular will be wholly dependent on the money the adventure earns), and half goes towards campaign stretch goals.<br/><br/>The other extras (Slipcase, Screen, Shirts, Dice) will not count towards stretch goals at all until their own costs are cleared. At that point all ""profit"" from each item will go towards general campaign stretch goals. (And the more that are produced, the less each individual unit costs.) Think of it as mini-embedded sub-crowdfunding campaigns. Because while some of those prices allow break-even to come relatively quickly (the dice in particular), those pricey Slipcases and Ref screen are listed pretty much at cost for 100 units. Get them while you can.<br/><br/>Now, IndieGoGo is not set up like a shopping cart, so if somebody picks Level 3 (30€ base) with 100€ in extras... I won't know whether that's going towards shirts or slipcases or Commentary or what. You can be helpful and email lotfp@lotfp.com right after pledging to let me know where you want your money allocated, to help us know where we are in relation to stretch goals. Otherwise, this tally won't happen until after the campaign ends... leaving a very good chance that we won't know about what stretch goals will be reached until after the campaign ends!<br/><br/>Also, the budget for each extra and all stretch goal amounts assume that IndieGoGo + Paypal will take 10% of all pledges in as fees. That's worst-case scenario, with 8-9% in fees being more typical. After the campaign ends, I will know exactly what percentage has been taken in fees, and adjust the stretch goal costs. So it is possible yet again for stretch goals to be achieved after the campaign ends.<br/><br/>This might sound complicated, and it is (you should see the scary database I've set up on my end to keep track of it all), but people who run these campaigns obsessively crunch numbers on their campaigns daily anyway, so might as well publish the numbers...<br/><br/>And that's how LotFP is going to attempt to run a fiscally responsible crowdfunding campaign where all the money goes where it's supposed to go and you get the best frickin' book possible and nobody goes broke delivering it. Seems a better solution than inflating stretch goals by guessing what proportion of extras vs. core rewards people will choose.<br/><br/><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/21674/files/20130819113649-ExtraBanner.jpg?1376937409"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p>Each of these extra items may be added to your pledge. You may add multiples of each item if you wish. These prices already include shipping costs.<br/><br/><p>These items are exclusive to this crowdfunding campaign. While there may be extras of any particular item after your rewards have all been mailed out, they will only be sold in person at conventions, never online. (Do note that the Retail option allows participating retailers to get some of these ""exclusive"" items - they are backers too! - so they may show up elsewhere after the campaign.)<b><br/></b></p>

Should we not reach the largest possible wordcount, some of these costs will be (much) less than what is listed. But we won't know until after the campaign is over. Which means that when such costs are finalized there is a chance that new stretch goals could be funded long after the campaign has ended just by updating the accounting!</p>

<p>The interface here does not act like a shopping cart... For example, if you choose the Level 3 perk and pay 50€, there is no indication exactly what extra you wanted in addition to the standard edition Ref book.<br/><br/>So after the campaign ends, all backers will receive an email confirming the amount they contributed, to ask them exactly what extras they want. Within days of the campaign ending, everyone should be on the same page with no surprises as to what they will receive and what they will not.<br/><br/>(You are of course free to email lotfp@lotfp.com at the time you back the project and specify where you want the money to go. In fact, if you have any questions at all about the process, leave a message on this campaign's comment page, or email, <i>before </i>spending any money.)<br/><br/>Backers at the appropriate levels will receive a PDF of the current Ref book right after the campaign ends, as well as the current PDFs of any Stretch Goal Adventures that are attained. The Thulian Echoes PDF will be distributed as soon as it is ready (a completed draft is already in hand as the campaign starts).<br/><br/>When the books are ready, they'll go on sale at the LotFP store and you will receive a notification email with your own unique coupon code to use. The coupon code will include the price of your Ref book plus any Stretch Goal adventures. This will be a general one-use coupon and not tied specifically to these items, so if you want to use it for different items in the store, you can. However, placing an order after this time that does not include the Ref book will mean a copy with the bookmark ribbons (and/or alternate cover copy) is no longer reserved for you.<br/><br/>The extras will not be on sale through the LotFP store - they will simply be added to your order. If you just backed for the extras and not the Ref book itself, just say so in response to the notification email and your stuff will be shipped out on its own.<br/><br/>If you're having budget problems at the time the books are made available and can't put in the order for the Ref book right away, let us know when we send the notification email so we can reserve your items.<br/><br/>People with Finnish addresses don't pay shipping through the LotFP store, so the notification email for them will pretty much just mean ""update your address if you've moved.""<br/><br/>Retail backers will be contacted directly and will not have to deal with the LotFP store at all.<br/></p>

LotFP still has some stuff outstanding that's past deadline. Guessing a ""real"" date seems like a losing proposition.<br/><br/>Because there is no real deadline for the book.<br/><br/>But the Ref book is essential to LotFP as a game and as a business, and the company is basically in neutral gear until it's done. So it's in everyone's interest to get it done in as timely manner as possible. And we will do our best not to drag our butts. But we won't cut corners.<br/><br/>Layout for the Rules &amp; Magic book took longer than expected, but the same template will be used for this book so who knows how that will affect things. We might hit some of the stretch goals that affect the book's content (more art, color layout, developmental editing), and those will add unknown amounts of time to the project. Someone pointed out in the run-up to this campaign that ""You mean if 50 people add on commentary by Zak, he's going to write 5000 words?"" and if that happens to one (or more...! One can dream...) of the commentators, that might add more time in.<br/><br/>While all of these things add time to the project, they also make the book better. And I hope they happen and will push for them to happen, but at the end of the day the people doing most of this stuff are freelancers who will need to fit this book into their schedules at the time it's ready for them.<br/><br/>So the actual delivery date is ""When it's done."" That isn't an option to enter into IndieGoGo for a delivery date though, and any reasonable guess is still pretty much blindly throwing darts. So why not January 2019 and poke fun at myself and others who have failed to correctly divine past completion dates?<br/><br/>So... You either want the book, or you don't. You either trust that it'll get done, or you don't.<br/><br/>If you don't want the book or don't trust that it'll get done, then backing this project is a bad idea no matter what date we stamp on it.<br/><br/>If you do want the book and do trust that it'll get done, we've put together some incentives to get you to back now instead of waiting until it's properly released.<br/><br/>It's up to you to decide whether those incentives are effective.<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/21682/files/20130819113834-RetailPackageBanner.jpg?1376937514"" src="""" style=""""/></p>300€  gets you 20 standard Referee books (with the bookmark ribbons) at a 50% discount, shipping included - the standard LotFP direct retail discount at 20 units ordered.

We're doing a new LotFP Ref book to match - if not exceed - the standards of the recently released Rules & Magic book. Hardcover, new layout, expanded content!

Backers get to vote on which stretch goals come next. You decide whether we go for a full color layout, or reprinting adventures, or comprehensive indexing, etc.


Backers can add on extras that make the book better for everyone. Want Frank Mentzer, Kenneth Hite, Zak S, or Michael Curtis to contribute? You want new monsters by Rafael Chandler and Aeron Alfrey to be part of the book? You make it happen!


No matter how much extra material is added, no matter what the final retail price of the book ends up being, your price is locked in once you back the project.


There are a ton of exclusives available, like a Referee screen, a new adventure, and an alternate cover available only to backers of this campaign.

Backers get a copy of the new printing of Death Frost Doom at no additional cost!
Backers get a copy of the new printing of Tower of the Stargazer at no additional cost!
Backers get a copy of a new Michael Curtis mini-adventure in PDF, or in print if contributing 100€ or more to the campaign!

And now for the long version of the campaign text with all the conditions and disclaimers and important detailed information:Lamentations of the Flame Princess is a tabletop RPG company based out of Helsinki Finland, and Weird Fantasy Role-Playing is a horror/fantasy/adventure RPG. It is wildly imaginative and uncompromising (read: explicit content; not for gaming with your kids), with top notch production values, striking art and a heavy metal attitude.
You can download a free version of the core rules without the artwork here and check out the guts of LotFP yourself, and you can download a fully illustrated 180 page LotFP adventure at no charge here.
You can see a gallery of previously published art (and even some art that will be included in the Ref book this campaign is funding!) here. Not safe for work.
You can buy current LotFP releases at the LotFP Webstore. Most of our releases are in the distribution chain, so you can get them at your local store, but the newer books (including the new Rules & Magic) won't go to distribution until the Referee book is printed.
Which is why we're doing the crowdfunding push. Read on...

The previous edition of LotFP (the ""Grindhouse Edition"") is just about sold out. We're out of copies at the LotFP headquarters, and there are few copies left in distribution. We need the core in print.
The Rules & Magic book (basically the player book) has been printed and is on sale from the LotFP webshop in Finland, but the Ref book has not yet been printed so the new version of the game as a whole cannot yet go into the retail chain where it attracts new fans.
We could go to press right now effectively reprinting the Grindhouse Ref book as a hardcover, but that's not good enough. It needs the professional layout and presentation to match the Rules & Magic book. And it could use some new art, additional editorial input, and all the great things that money can buy but that small publishers have problems financing out of pocket since they're not essential to the production of a book for it to still turn out pretty good.
So we here at LotFP hope you help to finance all of that and make this Ref book one that will both completely bury the previous editions of the book and be impressive enough to attract legions of new fans!

It'll be in hardcover. More durable, more impressive. It will have fresh editing. It will have a professional layout to match the new Rules & Magic book.
It will also have expanded content. LotFP is a living, growing game and so the advice in the book needs to be updated. But it will not replace the old advice, rather it will be presented alongside the previous advice in the book to highlight the fact that there is no one right way to play the game.
It will have a brand new section with tons of crunchy play aids, including a brand new creature generator (specializing in extra-dimensional mockeries of reality) with an expanded roster of sample monsters (but still no official game bestiary!), adventure generators, and all sorts of (hopefully) useful charts and tables to make adventure creation easier that will ensure that you keep this Ref book at hand when preparing your next session.
And of course there is new art, with Jason Rainville, Aeron Alfrey, and Eric Lofgren already having turned in new interior pieces (yes, a good pile of money has already been put into the project, this isn't all being done just on all your backs):
Plus there is a new cover for the Ref book (standard edition) by Malcolm McClinton:
And exclusive to this campaign is the limited edition wraparound cover, by Yannick Bouchard:

We're doing two things differently than traditional crowdfunding campaigns:
First, the Levels 3 - 5 Perks DO NOT INCLUDE SHIPPING COSTS.
What will happen is when the book is ready, you will receive a coupon code for the value of the Ref book (or two), and you will purchase it from the LotFP Webstore, paying the regular shipping costs at that time (and adding whatever other items you wish at the time).
Many crowdfunding campaigns, even ones that are on schedule, either wind up producing larger books than originally planned (which should be a good thing for everyone, right?) or the post office raises their rates between the time the campaign ends and fulfillment begins. It has turned seemingly profitable crowdfunding campaigns into a shipping cost grinder that causes the loss of thousands of dollars.
The estimated weight that this Ref book + Death Frost Doom will be is 575g. Economy shipping for 575g in books would be 7,50€ according to current second-class rates. 1075g for both versions of the Ref book + Death Frost Doom would be 12,50€ to EU addresses and 15,00€ to non-EU addresses for second-class rates. But the book may be bigger. Or smaller. 
But to the customer's advantage here, the extras will be added to those shipments at no added charge. And if we load up on stretch goals increasing the retail price of the book, Perk Levels 3-5 still get you the voucher for the full price based on your backing of the project here.
And then we can just add the value of any additional Stretch Goal Adventures to the voucher, and as each of those books is estimated to weigh about 75g, that would result in a 2,50€ shipping cost increase for non-EU residents if more than one stretch goal adventure is funded.
But again, those are all according to current postage rates, which may change at any time and we don't get much advance notice, and that's why we're not just adding 7,50€ to the cost of the perk levels and calling shipping costs covered.
Second, Extras bought will not automatically count towards stretch goals.Extra bits and stretch goals have also been a frequent financial killer of ""successful"" crowdfunding campaigns.Publishers want to give you lots of cool stuff and extra tidbits. We really do. But this stuff costs money to produce. If you're running a campaign and you say the stretch goal for the next big improvement to the book is 2000€, and you get there because people bought 200 10€ fiddlydoos, and those fiddlydoos cost 5€ to produce... congratulations, you're on the hook for both the stretch goal improvements and the fiddlydoos, and you're down 1000€ out of pocket.But I still want to offer stretch goals, and I still want to offer fiddlydoos.So here's how we're going to do it.Some of the extras have absolutely fixed costs. These are the Commentary, New Monsters, and Personalized Art extras. Half of each purchased extra will go towards the costs of the extra (paying talent!), the other half will go towards stretch goals.Thulian Echoes will have half of each purchased extra go towards production costs for that adventure (its art budget in particular will be wholly dependent on the money the adventure earns), and half goes towards campaign stretch goals.The other extras (Slipcase, Screen, Shirts, Dice) will not count towards stretch goals at all until their own costs are cleared. At that point all ""profit"" from each item will go towards general campaign stretch goals. (And the more that are produced, the less each individual unit costs.) Think of it as mini-embedded sub-crowdfunding campaigns. Because while some of those prices allow break-even to come relatively quickly (the dice in particular), those pricey Slipcases and Ref screen are listed pretty much at cost for 100 units. Get them while you can.Now, IndieGoGo is not set up like a shopping cart, so if somebody picks Level 3 (30€ base) with 100€ in extras... I won't know whether that's going towards shirts or slipcases or Commentary or what. You can be helpful and email lotfp@lotfp.com right after pledging to let me know where you want your money allocated, to help us know where we are in relation to stretch goals. Otherwise, this tally won't happen until after the campaign ends... leaving a very good chance that we won't know about what stretch goals will be reached until after the campaign ends!Also, the budget for each extra and all stretch goal amounts assume that IndieGoGo + Paypal will take 10% of all pledges in as fees. That's worst-case scenario, with 8-9% in fees being more typical. After the campaign ends, I will know exactly what percentage has been taken in fees, and adjust the stretch goal costs. So it is possible yet again for stretch goals to be achieved after the campaign ends.This might sound complicated, and it is (you should see the scary database I've set up on my end to keep track of it all), but people who run these campaigns obsessively crunch numbers on their campaigns daily anyway, so might as well publish the numbers...And that's how LotFP is going to attempt to run a fiscally responsible crowdfunding campaign where all the money goes where it's supposed to go and you get the best frickin' book possible and nobody goes broke delivering it. Seems a better solution than inflating stretch goals by guessing what proportion of extras vs. core rewards people will choose.Each of these extra items may be added to your pledge. You may add multiples of each item if you wish. These prices already include shipping costs.These items are exclusive to this crowdfunding campaign. While there may be extras of any particular item after your rewards have all been mailed out, they will only be sold in person at conventions, never online. (Do note that the Retail option allows participating retailers to get some of these ""exclusive"" items - they are backers too! - so they may show up elsewhere after the campaign.)


50€ New Monster by Rafael Chandler and Aeron Alfrey!""LotFP doesn't have a bestiary!"" I'm sure you've heard that one before. Well... there will be an expanded selection of sample monsters. But this is your chance to expand that even more for everyone! Rafael Chandler and Aeron Alfrey will team up to write up and illustrate a new monster for the Sample Monsters section.


45€ Personalized Olli Hihnala Art!Artist Olli Hihnala will do a one-of-a-kind sketch for you inside your copy of the Ref book. (If you are getting both Ref books, the sketch will go inside the limited version.) Your perks would ship later than they otherwise would because of course Hihnala would need time to receive and work through the books to be sketched in.


25€ Commentary!When the new Referee book's text is finalized, your choice of Frank Mentzer, Michael Curtis, Kenneth Hite, or Zak S will read through it and offer at least 100 words of commentary/suggestions/advice 
where they see fit, to be included in the final text of the book. Every Commentary! 
extra added by a backer means at least 100 more words of commentary, expanding the scope of the book for everyone!


25€ SlipcaseA nice thick (1.8mm board) full color slipcase designed to hold this Referee hardcover and the Rules & Magic hardcover (which is not included in this campaign, but is available for purchase here), with brand new artwork from Olli Hihnala. This extra includes JUST the slipcase, not any books inside! (Hihnala's slipcase art... Summon gone wrong at the auto-da-fé!)


25€ Referee Screen(Ryan's Ref screen concept roughs.)A  large (estimated 21x89cm) three-panel Referee screen on heavy 2.5mm board with full color art by Matthew Ryan on one side, and a load of reference charts - many not in the Rules & Magic or Referee book endpapers, on the other! (Artwork is already underway and we hope/expect to be able to show the final art before the end of the campaign.)The screen art:

For example, if you choose the Level 3 perk and pay 50€, there is no indication exactly what extra you wanted in addition to the standard edition Ref book.So after the campaign ends, all backers will receive an email confirming the amount they contributed, to ask them exactly what extras they want. Within days of the campaign ending, everyone should be on the same page with no surprises as to what they will receive and what they will not.(You are of course free to email lotfp@lotfp.com at the time you back the project and specify where you want the money to go. In fact, if you have any questions at all about the process, leave a message on this campaign's comment page, or email, before spending any money.)Backers at the appropriate levels will receive a PDF of the current Ref book right after the campaign ends, as well as the current PDFs of any Stretch Goal Adventures that are attained. The Thulian Echoes PDF will be distributed as soon as it is ready (a completed draft is already in hand as the campaign starts).When the books are ready, they'll go on sale at the LotFP store and you will receive a notification email with your own unique coupon code to use. The coupon code will include the price of your Ref book plus any Stretch Goal adventures. This will be a general one-use coupon and not tied specifically to these items, so if you want to use it for different items in the store, you can. However, placing an order after this time that does not include the Ref book will mean a copy with the bookmark ribbons (and/or alternate cover copy) is no longer reserved for you.The extras will not be on sale through the LotFP store - they will simply be added to your order. If you just backed for the extras and not the Ref book itself, just say so in response to the notification email and your stuff will be shipped out on its own.If you're having budget problems at the time the books are made available and can't put in the order for the Ref book right away, let us know when we send the notification email so we can reserve your items.People with Finnish addresses don't pay shipping through the LotFP store, so the notification email for them will pretty much just mean ""update your address if you've moved.""Retail backers will be contacted directly and will not have to deal with the LotFP store at all.
Being honest... a great many crowdfunding campaigns greatly underestimate the time it takes to get the projects together and to the backers and end up being late. LotFP still has some stuff outstanding that's past deadline. Guessing a ""real"" date seems like a losing proposition.Because there is no real deadline for the book.But the Ref book is essential to LotFP as a game and as a business, and the company is basically in neutral gear until it's done. So it's in everyone's interest to get it done in as timely manner as possible. And we will do our best not to drag our butts. But we won't cut corners.Layout for the Rules & Magic book took longer than expected, but the same template will be used for this book so who knows how that will affect things. We might hit some of the stretch goals that affect the book's content (more art, color layout, developmental editing), and those will add unknown amounts of time to the project. Someone pointed out in the run-up to this campaign that ""You mean if 50 people add on commentary by Zak, he's going to write 5000 words?"" and if that happens to one (or more...! One can dream...) of the commentators, that might add more time in.While all of these things add time to the project, they also make the book better. And I hope they happen and will push for them to happen, but at the end of the day the people doing most of this stuff are freelancers who will need to fit this book into their schedules at the time it's ready for them.So the actual delivery date is ""When it's done."" That isn't an option to enter into IndieGoGo for a delivery date though, and any reasonable guess is still pretty much blindly throwing darts. So why not January 2019 and poke fun at myself and others who have failed to correctly divine past completion dates?So... You either want the book, or you don't. You either trust that it'll get done, or you don't.If you don't want the book or don't trust that it'll get done, then backing this project is a bad idea no matter what date we stamp on it.If you do want the book and do trust that it'll get done, we've put together some incentives to get you to back now instead of waiting until it's properly released.It's up to you to decide whether those incentives are effective.300€  gets you 20 standard Referee books (with the bookmark ribbons) at a 50% discount, shipping included - the standard LotFP direct retail discount at 20 units ordered. You get 2 more standard Ref books for every additional 30€ you pledge. In addition:
You may substitute 3 standard Ref books for 2 of the limited edition cover version.
You may substitute 4 standard Ref books for 3 of the Slipcases (just the slipcases, no books in them).
You may substitute 2 standard Ref books for 3 Rules & Magic hardcovers.
You may substitute 4 standard Ref books for 3 Referee Screens.

You may substitute 2 standard Ref books for 5 print copies of Thulian Echoes.
You may substitute 1 standard Ref book for 2 T-shirts.

You may substitute 2 standard Ref books for 5 sets of Dice.


Retail Package backers will also get 1 copy of each Stretch Goal adventure reached for every 5 standard Ref books (or the equivalent) pledged for at no extra charge (including Death Frost Doom!).

</h3></div><div>
<p>“That's a really long flight for a baby.”<br/>“You’ll have to pack so many things! What if they don’t have diapers and baby necessities?”<br/>“What about the hospitals? If he gets sick, you’ll be sorry.”<br/><br/>These were the questions and comments that we got on a daily basis from concerned family and friends who thought we were crazy for deciding to take our then two-month-old to Bangkok, Thailand. Since I love to travel any chance I can, I concocted a plan to make my husband’s international work assignment coincide with my maternity leave to create an epic adventure for our little family. Growing up in the Bronx, I experienced first hand how travel can completely open up ones perspective and provide a type of education that you could never get in a classroom. I knew early on that I’d want to provide the same opportunity for my children, and so I did just that.<br/><br/>My son Lenox was considered an anomaly for many reasons. He was only two months old embarking on a long trip most people don’t take until they are much older, if at all. Most notably, he is a Black boy, and is not represented in typical travel ads. As I scoured the shelves looking for anything that would help prepare him for our journey, I quickly realized that he wasn’t represented in books about travel. While flipping through the pages, one thing became painfully clear: none of the characters ever looked like him. It was important that he see himself as a traveler, and thus my book idea was born.<br/><br/>I am so grateful for the opportunity to fill a gap I saw in literature and write a book for young readers with diverse characters.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Book - <i>Lenox Takes Flight</i>
</h3>
<p>Lenox is an imaginative kid who loves airplanes and dreams of the day he will get to board one. When his parents announce that the family is taking a trip overseas, he learns that his great grandad was a Tuskegee Airman who earned pilot wings. He cannot wait to board his first flight and get a pair of his own, until the excitement causes him to lose his passport in the airport. He and his little sister, Teagan, slip away from their parents and set out on an adventure to find it before their flight takes off.<br/><br/>This is an <strong>early chapter book for middle-grade students</strong> that speaks to everyone, but especially parents, educators and children from all backgrounds. Through the incorporation of historical elements like the legendary Tuskegee Airmen, depicting the kids reciting affirmations in the mirror as I do with my children each day, and the sheer excitement of taking their first flight, young readers will be inspired to expand their perspective. This novel will help readers experience the magic of travel, appreciate the unique differences in people and take an adventure through an airport, where all journeys begin.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>Lenox Takes Flight</i>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Normalizes difference for middle grade readers so they understand that difference, is just different!</li>
<li>Inspires children of color to find comfort and gain confidence by seeing someone who looks like them represented in travel literature.</li>
<li>Helps children understand that travel is something anyone can experience, no matter their age or background.</li>
<li>Supports parents, teachers, and caregivers as they continue to foster curiosity and a sense of wonder in children.</li>
</ul>
<p>I look forward to exploring these topics and beyond with my readers!</p>

</div></div>","THE DREAM + THE PROMISE / WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU
We will make two extraordinary children's books. That's the dream and that's the promise. We cannot do it without you.
NO RISK
If we don't make our all or nothing goal, you will automatically be refunded 100% of your money. But don't count on it, because we're determined to make it and send you our little books instead. 

Tiny, pudgy baby hands signing the American Sign Language Alphabet. Enough said. If your heart just jumped looking at this illustration by Janice Wu for our book with a title too long to be included in our campaign heading, then you'll love what we have up our sleeve. The American Sign Language Hipster Alphabet For Babes - A Coffee Table Book For Young Humans is sure to make you smile out loud. 
And if that doesn't tickle you enough, then we're bringing you Ashley O'Mara's illustrations for our whimsical world of Henri Herald Honey Bee who dreams of being an investigative reporter for the Bee Bee See. Read and watch her break the story on how the polar bears do it on floating ice (hopefully well into our planet's future), the bats do it upside down and the whales do it under water. This milky tale may make you lactate, at least if you're still nursing. like me. 

THE HEAD LOON
Hello, I'm Linnie von Sky and we may have met before. If we did, I probably sprung a conversation on you while nursing my little lady and made you tell me much more about what floats your boat than you ever thought you'd share and then got so excited about it that I couldn't stop myself from spreading the word about your talent to my tribe.  I'm a guerrilla networker, story teller, author, relentless dream catcher, mama and wife. Bred in Berlin, I live deeply rooted in my Vancouver community. 
In 2012 I wrote a story on three Air Canada barf bags and the rest is history. My little indie publishing house is called Silk Web Publishing, because we elegantly weave webs of talented individuals who put their hearts together to make publishing dreams fly. THANKS to YOU, OUR CROWD, we have successfully published three extrodinary (if I may say so myself) children's books on Immigration, Bullying and Depression. Take a stroll through our Indiegogo campaign history here, here and here and see for yourself. 

Now we're making Books IV + V and I'm once again willing to risk a very public belly flop, knowing in my soul that the talent of those up on the dive board with me and THE POWER OF THE CROWD behind us will turn this into a swan dive.

THE COLLABORATORS AND ART MAGICIANS
Let me introduce you to some of the most talented and sparkling human beings I have the privilege to work with and call friends. 
ASHLEY O'MARA (click to open a magic window to pet portrait heaven)
Illustrator, Designer, Animal Lover. Ash is the illustrator of our Sadly The Owl (2015). She also illustrates pet portraits.
I can't wait for this chicken loving queen of the brush to illustrate The Birds And The Bees Don't Do It. I love this woman's brain and strokes and I can't wait for her to surprise us with details that live between the lines of my stories that are yet to be imagined. 
Norm the Pug thinks you should buy our books. (c) by Ashley O'Mara

JANICE WU (click to open a window into a world of illustration that you will blow your art loving mind)
Illustrator. Talent to the core. Out of my league. 
Janice is currently perfecting the art of illustrating pudgy ABC signing baby hands that make your heart melt for The American Sign Language Hipster Alphabet For Babes A Coffee Table Book For Young Humans. I think she succeeded. I'm so grateful to have landed her as the illustrator for my new future favourite coffee table book. 
Here is how Janice gets you to feel emotional about a plastic bag. This stunning illustration makes me weep.
(c) Janice Wu “Kiu Shum”, 2014,  18″ x 24″, pencil and gouache on paper. 

LEE ANN STEYNS (click to learn to speak with babies w/o moving your lips)
Lee Ann is the queen bee of signing babies. If you have a baby in Vancouver, you've hopefully met this bright light of a life saver. Now that Ella can sign 'milk please' she's no longer clawing my clothes for self service boob breaks. Thanks to Lee Ann, minimal levels of civility have re-entered our home, but then again...Ella's going on two. Enough said. 
It's such a gift to have this incredible mama on a signing mission be involved in our American Sign Language Hipster Alphabet For Babes and we found her the perfect title: American Sign Language Alphabet Consultant. Lee Ann consults with good vibes, an infectious laugh and hands that gracefully communicate on mute. 
*Lift flat hand to mouth with palm facing toward face and fingertips touching lips and then bow hand toward recipient. 
Hopefully she'll stay tuned for our upcoming project The American Sign Language Baby Survival Guide to the Universe. (life's not life if you don't have your dream after the dream lined up)

Lee Ann signing the letter B for BELIEVE (and we believe in our crowd).
THE BEAN COUNTING MUMBO JUMBO BEHIND THIS DREAM 
Insert an Abacus and a whole lot more money than I've ever seen or can imagine. FOURTYTHOUSANDOLLARSCANADIAN. That's the magic sum that will allow me to pay everyone involved. Illustrators, editors (namely one...the incredible Taisha who has stuck by my side through more than one book), book designers, art digitalizers (shout out to Ted at Image This Photographics Inc who has worked on every one of my books and saved our publishing butt more than once with his experience from his former life as an Emily Carr Professor) and of course the printer folks. We're outsourcing no part of this and are so proud to pay all fine humans involved, fair wages. 
THE TIMELINE
How about Easter 2018? Sound fair? We have finished every project within its promised delivery window of a year and apart from the odd package being returned by Canada Post, we have yet to hear that any of our previous books were not delivered. We hope we found you all in the end. 
NOTICE: pipe up NOW if you're still out there sitting on your stoop waiting on any of our previous books, because we don't know we didn't find you and we'd like to make it right. We're not in the business of cheating those who help us make our dreams come true.
YOU CAN ALSO HELP US...
by spreading the sweet dream nectar to your tribe via instagram, facebook, twitter, email or good old fashioned carrier piegeon. 
On behalf of the entire team I THANK YOU from the bottom of our hopelessly, artistic little big hearts. 
Warmly and sincerely, 
Linnie von Sky 
Chief Instigator of Publishing Dreams at Silk Web Publishing

<h3>The Story of Implants</h3>
<p>Implants follows a diverse group of college students who travel to Sweden and shortly after begin facing inexplicable experiences that set them on a mission to make it back home. The four students accepted into The School of International Relations face unique challenges the week before their Fall semester, a semester that never begins.</p>
<p>In this futuristic society, everyone relies on hand microchips for basic activities such as opening doors and making purchases. At one point, the students suspect that their strange experiences are related to these microchips. However, their struggles began before they got implanted. After witnessing the loss of one of their fellow students, the remaining classmates are determined to escape from the experimental program they have become a part of, only to face increasingly precarious barriers as they discover their fate.</p>
<p>My name is Amari Rae Pulido (they/them/theirs), and I am the author of <i>Implants</i>. I wrote this book because I love reading, and it has been my dream to write a story that people enjoy since the age of six. I hope that this book will encourage readers to think critically about the consequences of technological advancements. <i>Implants </i>takes readers on a multi-perspective journey that questions the figures we trust and how we perceive our realities through an intersectional lens.</p>
<p>The main characters are four study abroad students who travel to attend The School of International Relations in Sweden. Within the first week leading up to the start of classes, they learn more about each other and their program directors through conversations and excursions in the country. During one of these excursions, a student tells his classmates something strange has happened to him that they don’t believe. That is, until strange things begin happening to them, too.</p>
<p>After losing a classmate, the students question who they can trust while struggling to control themselves against external and seemingly internal factors. They seek help to leave the experiment they have unwillingly joined, but not all of the students or their program directors turn out to be helpful.</p>
<p>You will love this book if you enjoy science fiction, dystopian stories, psychological thrillers, mysteries, Ray Bradbury, or series like Black Mirror and Stranger Things. Implants speaks to adults and students everywhere who want to grapple with futuristic technology and intersectional journeys in a new way.</p>

<h3><strong>The Story of Aether Wuld</strong></h3>
<p><i>You don’t hear about the grief, the failings, the pressure that heroes go through, and that’s because heroes don’t exist, not in our world and not in Aether Wuld. Just people.</i><br/><br/>My name is Marlon Rodriguez. I wrote Aether Wuld to provide my readers with a realistic protagonist. I was tired of reading stories where the hero overcomes their obstacles with ease; where they are unfazed by the challenges they’re met with.<br/>Frankly, these kinds of people don’t exist.<br/>Everyone has their demons: trauma, grievances, mistakes. Some are able to face these challenges and move forward. Some cannot, and there’s nothing wrong with that. Eita’s Kihn, a city in the southwest of Aether Wuld’s single continent, Maan Kaal, is meant to be a haven for this latter group, for people that do not want to worry about the hardships of their reality. In Eita’s Kihn, they could be themselves and be protected from all the dangers of life.<br/>Pain is necessary to live, but that doesn’t mean we have to roll over and just let it happen.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you’ll discover the beauty of living. Life has more hardships than I can count and sometimes all you can see is red, but if you know where to look, you’ll be able to see rainbows. The world I created is cruel and unforgiving, but Ymir and her loved ones established Eita’s Kihn to be a safe haven. I welcome you to follow along and witness all that she’s willing to do and has endured to keep our promises.<br/><br/><br/>Our story takes place in the titular Aether Wuld, on the Pangaean continent of Maan Kaal. To the southwest, Ymir the four-armed giant and her friends search for their lost companions Roe and Marin. Little do they know it’s a race against time because they’re not the only ones searching: Arcvadasz, the High Spirit of Death, is also on the hunt.<br/><br/>In addition to Arcvadasz and his followers, Ymir and her friends need to watch out for the Anihu. Thousands of years ago they used to be humans, but have long since diverged into the depths of beasthood. Some retained their wits and humanity and went on to establish their own kingdom known as the Anih Kihn. Others lost themselves to their primal rage and become nothing more than mindless beasts that ravage everything in their path. But the Anihu are just one type of creature they need to evade.<br/><br/>Another is the Sötalo, who originally ripped their way into the world from a separate reality where their entire existence depended on their ability to slaughter and reproduce. For better or for worse, they continuously adapt through evolution to their ever-changing environment. The Sömek, even more scarce than their ancestors, have managed to integrate into the present societies through various means.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you want to read about epic and terrifying creatures, the true effects ‘heroism’ has on an individual, or if you’re like me and try to read into what’s really behind the pages.</p>
<p><br/>Aether Wuld speaks to the determined and the tired who want to experience the realities we share, from the other side of the coin.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that Aether Wuld inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How much, is too much?</li>
<li>How much do you really know about the people you care about?</li>
<li>Are you willing to be a part of change when it presents itself?</li>
</ul>
<p>I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers!</p>
<h3><strong>A Blurb From the Book</strong></h3>
<p><i>Atop the tower Ymir, the giantess, holds the handle of her bow with her two right arms, and draws the full length of the string with her other two. She exhales slowly, and in tempo with her heartbeat, looses the arrow with a deep twang from the bow.<br/>          One, silence fills the air as she watches the enemy advance into her home.<br/>          Two, she watches an overconfident fool revel in his unknowing last moments.<br/>          Three, she closes her eyes as the arrow releases a thunderous explosion in the sky on its way to its mark.<br/>She offers a final warning to the intruders but is met with a lust for death. Ymir draws another arrow before mumbling to herself, “I gave you all an out.” One after another, she looses arrows as a storm rages through the clear skies. She watches as the sturdy formation of the zealots crumbles into chaos. As they trip over each other she feels a weight on her heart but remains stalwart, feeding the storm.</i><br/> </p>
<h3><strong>About the Author</strong></h3>
<p>Marlon Rodriguez is a first-time author and son who can now brag about being the first author in his family.<br/>He wrote this book to be a safe haven for the weary as well as a means to explore the realities we live in.<br/>He’s also someone who spends way too much time in his own head, running unlikely and near-impossible scenarios through it at any given moment. Marlon has a tendency to overthink any and everything, including compliments.</p>

You don’t hear about the grief, the failings, the pressure that heroes go through, and that’s because heroes don’t exist, not in our world and not in Aether Wuld. Just people.My name is Marlon Rodriguez. I wrote Aether Wuld to provide my readers with a realistic protagonist. I was tired of reading stories where the hero overcomes their obstacles with ease; where they are unfazed by the challenges they’re met with.Frankly, these kinds of people don’t exist.Everyone has their demons: trauma, grievances, mistakes. Some are able to face these challenges and move forward. Some cannot, and there’s nothing wrong with that. Eita’s Kihn, a city in the southwest of Aether Wuld’s single continent, Maan Kaal, is meant to be a haven for this latter group, for people that do not want to worry about the hardships of their reality. In Eita’s Kihn, they could be themselves and be protected from all the dangers of life.Pain is necessary to live, but that doesn’t mean we have to roll over and just let it happen.My hope is that, in reading this book, you’ll discover the beauty of living. Life has more hardships than I can count and sometimes all you can see is red, but if you know where to look, you’ll be able to see rainbows. The world I created is cruel and unforgiving, but Ymir and her loved ones established Eita’s Kihn to be a safe haven. I welcome you to follow along and witness all that she’s willing to do and has endured to keep our promises.Our story takes place in the titular Aether Wuld, on the Pangaean continent of Maan Kaal. To the southwest, Ymir the four-armed giant and her friends search for their lost companions Roe and Marin. Little do they know it’s a race against time because they’re not the only ones searching: Arcvadasz, the High Spirit of Death, is also on the hunt.In addition to Arcvadasz and his followers, Ymir and her friends need to watch out for the Anihu. Thousands of years ago they used to be humans, but have long since diverged into the depths of beasthood. Some retained their wits and humanity and went on to establish their own kingdom known as the Anih Kihn. Others lost themselves to their primal rage and become nothing more than mindless beasts that ravage everything in their path. But the Anihu are just one type of creature they need to evade.Another is the Sötalo, who originally ripped their way into the world from a separate reality where their entire existence depended on their ability to slaughter and reproduce. For better or for worse, they continuously adapt through evolution to their ever-changing environment. The Sömek, even more scarce than their ancestors, have managed to integrate into the present societies through various means.You will love this book if you want to read about epic and terrifying creatures, the true effects ‘heroism’ has on an individual, or if you’re like me and try to read into what’s really behind the pages.
Aether Wuld speaks to the determined and the tired who want to experience the realities we share, from the other side of the coin.Ultimately, I hope that Aether Wuld inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:

How much, is too much?
How much do you really know about the people you care about?
Are you willing to be a part of change when it presents itself?

I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers!
A Blurb From the Book
Atop the tower Ymir, the giantess, holds the handle of her bow with her two right arms, and draws the full length of the string with her other two. She exhales slowly, and in tempo with her heartbeat, looses the arrow with a deep twang from the bow.          One, silence fills the air as she watches the enemy advance into her home.          Two, she watches an overconfident fool revel in his unknowing last moments.          Three, she closes her eyes as the arrow releases a thunderous explosion in the sky on its way to its mark.She offers a final warning to the intruders but is met with a lust for death. Ymir draws another arrow before mumbling to herself, “I gave you all an out.” One after another, she looses arrows as a storm rages through the clear skies. She watches as the sturdy formation of the zealots crumbles into chaos. As they trip over each other she feels a weight on her heart but remains stalwart, feeding the storm. 
About the Author
Marlon Rodriguez is a first-time author and son who can now brag about being the first author in his family.He wrote this book to be a safe haven for the weary as well as a means to explore the realities we live in.He’s also someone who spends way too much time in his own head, running unlikely and near-impossible scenarios through it at any given moment. Marlon has a tendency to overthink any and everything, including compliments.

The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in December 2021.

The Cover Design of my book. (The mockups you see currently are a placeholder!)

The Layout Design for the interior of my book (physical copy, ebook formats).

The Copyediting for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.

The Launch & Promotion Efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this Winter.
I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:
You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish it and a handwritten thank-you note.
Your name will appear in the Acknowledgments section of my book (“with Special Thanks to”).

You will have the opportunity to be involved in selecting my cover and title.
You will be invited to join my Author Community and get behind-the-scenes sneak peeks into the publishing process.
And much more!

Risks & ChallengesThe biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies are expected to ship.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Michael Chidester. I started HEMA in 2001, and for the past ten years, I've been leading a project called Wiktenauer. Wiktenauer grew out of a desire to set the text of our fencing manuals free from the page and put it into the hands of fencers. What I'd like to do with this project is slightly different: put the page, and the whole book, into your hands as well. We're going to produce a facsimile of one of the most beautiful 15th century fencing manuals, the København Talhoffer manuscript.</p>
<p>Facsimile is a word that's thrown around a lot, and means different things to different people. What I mean when I use it is a careful reproduction of the entire physical book in detail. Such facsimiles are often produced of famous manuscripts and early printed books for collectors, and they are also exhibited by museums and libraries in cases where the original can't or shouldn't be displayed.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1571683068/ksf4qcafoyifyp1dp4kg.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><i>Comparing the New Haven Gladiatoria manuscript to the Orbis Pictus facsimile of the Kraków version.</i></p>
<p>I have had the privilege in my day of handling several 15th and 16th century fencing manuscripts, as well as copies of most of the printed fencing manuals published before 1600, and I wish everyone in HEMA could have that same chance. It's a way of connecting to history that's hard to describe. A good facsimile can capture at least a small piece of that magic, and give you a sense of what the origin of our fencing reconstruction really is.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1571683682/kthlsriiy6qrddrrlkhj.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><i>The Extraordinary Editions facsimile of Royal Armouries ms. I.33 (now FECHT 1).</i></p>
<p>There are many treatises worthy of this sort of project, but to date only two have received it: the <a href=""https://wiktenauer.com/wiki/Gladiatoria_(MS_Germ.Quart.16)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Gladiatoria manuscript</a> held by the Biblioteka Jagiellońska in Kraków, Poland, and <a href=""https://wiktenauer.com/wiki/Walpurgis_Fechtbuch_(MS_I.33)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Walpurgis Fechtbuch</a>, held by the Royal Armouries in Leeds, UK. I would love to produce many more of these, but to start with, I've selected a manuscript written by the famous master Hans Talhoffer and held by Det Kongelige Bibliotek in København, Denmark, the <a href=""https://wiktenauer.com/wiki/Talhoffer_Fechtbuch_(MS_Thott.290.2%C2%BA)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Thott 290 2º</a>.</p>
<p>This manuscript is lavishly illustrated and contains not only the fencing teachings of Johannes Liechtenauer and Hans Talhoffer, but also a German translation of Konrad Kyeser's famous war book <i>Bellifortis</i>, and various esoteric teachings on subjects such as astronomy and physiology. You can learn more about this fascinating text in the National Geographic special <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26pNAZOg3KQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Medieval Fightbook</i></a>.</p>
<p>Should this campaign succeed, then many more such facsimiles may follow in the coming years. (I'd love to do a copy of Fiore next.)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Facsimiles like this are usually quite expensive. For example, the <a href=""http://www.orbispictus.pl/en/22,gladiatoria"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Orbis Pictus Gladiatoria</a> cost ~$900, while the <a href=""http://extraordinaryeditions.com/our-books/the-illuminated-fightbook-royal-armouries-manuscript-i33/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Extraordinary Editions I.33</a> was released in two different editions, costing ~$1,000 and $2,000. Other facsimiles can cost into the five figure range.</p>
<p>One of my objectives in this project is to see how inexpensively such a book can be produced. I've selected <a href=""https://www.grimmbindery.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Grimm Book Bindery</a> in Madison, WI, to do the printing and binding, and spent quite a bit of time discussing the project with them and ironing out every detail to be as precise as possible. We can't source the metal corner protectors and clasp while keeping costs low (the best price I could find for the type used in this period would add hundreds of dollars to the price), but everything else down to the blind tooling on the cover will be as close as we can make it using modern methods.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1571685054/jfav4plzqwfggsghqvwl.jpg"" src="""" style=""width:400px;""/></p>
<p>To do this, we need a minimum of 100 orders, so I have set the funding goal accordingly. I had originally hoped to offer each one for $100, but after tallying the costs up, $150 seems to be the lowest feasible price point.</p>
<p>This price depends on volume, so it will be a one-and-done print run, and people who don't order now will not have a chance again (unless we can scrape together another 100 orders). If we can get up to 250 orders, then some additional enhancements might become feasibly (more on that as we go).</p>

<p>But wait, there's more!</p>
<p>When I discussed this on the Wiktenauer page this summer, some people asked for a translation to go along with the facsimile. Unfortunately, the only complete translation that currently exists was authored by Jeffrey Hull, and I have been unable to contact him for permission to use it.</p>
<p>What I offer instead is a companion volume containing research and discussion of this manuscript by some of the best researchers in HEMA, both academics and auto-didacts, including Dr. Ariella Elema, Dr. Daniel Jaquet, Jens P.

<p>More on the contents of this book will be laid out as the campaign progresses.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I've never put together a project like this before, and neither has Grimm Bindery. It's possible that there will be problems along the way that we didn't anticipate, despite all of our discussion. We will produce the best book possible, and I will have a chance to make adjustments when a sample book is delivered, but there may be some aspects of the original manuscript that either aren't clear from the scans or can't be mass-produced, and those defects may not be correctable.</p>

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<i>Will Work for Pie</i> is a guide to how early-stage bootstrapped companies can use equity, instead of cash, to grow their business and get funded. Equity can be a powerful tool to attract resources and talent to your startup, but dividing it up improperly can cause irreversible damage to the team and derail an otherwise promising company. <i>Will Work for Pie</i> shows how to apply the logic of Slicing Pie — a model for equity splits that has been used by thousands of startups all over the world — to create a perfectly fair equity split.<br/><br/>My name is Mike Moyer and I am the author of <i>Will Work for Pie</i>. I wrote this book because conventional wisdom and advice regarding startup equity splits is just plain wrong and following it will virtually guarantee your team will wind up in an equity dispute that could ruin your working relationships and possibly your company.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that it’s easy to be perfectly fair with your partners, employees, and other participants in your startup. There’s nothing quite like building a startup company with a passionate, collaborative team; and making sure each member gets treated fairly should be a top priority.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn what fairness looks like in a startup and how to achieve it including:<ul>
<li>How the Slicing Pie model works and why it always creates a fair split</li>
<li>What motivates employees and teams and how to build an effective incentive program</li>

Story of My Book
Will Work for Pie is a guide to how early-stage bootstrapped companies can use equity, instead of cash, to grow their business and get funded. Equity can be a powerful tool to attract resources and talent to your startup, but dividing it up improperly can cause irreversible damage to the team and derail an otherwise promising company. Will Work for Pie shows how to apply the logic of Slicing Pie — a model for equity splits that has been used by thousands of startups all over the world — to create a perfectly fair equity split.My name is Mike Moyer and I am the author of Will Work for Pie. I wrote this book because conventional wisdom and advice regarding startup equity splits is just plain wrong and following it will virtually guarantee your team will wind up in an equity dispute that could ruin your working relationships and possibly your company.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that it’s easy to be perfectly fair with your partners, employees, and other participants in your startup. There’s nothing quite like building a startup company with a passionate, collaborative team; and making sure each member gets treated fairly should be a top priority.In this book, you'll learn what fairness looks like in a startup and how to achieve it including:
How the Slicing Pie model works and why it always creates a fair split
What motivates employees and teams and how to build an effective incentive program
How to determine the fair market value of just about anything your company needs

You will love this book if you have ever been involved in, or are thinking about getting involved in a new startup company. Few books offer such clear, concrete, actionable advice. Even if you are already familiar with the Slicing Pie model, this book will expand on the concept and show how it’s applied to different situations.Will Work for Pie is a non-fiction book that speaks to startup founders and early participants who are looking at building a team to start a company for the first time or seasoned entrepreneurs who may be wary of equity splits after a bad experience (or two).
Just contributed to this campaign. Mike Moyer has a been an inspiration and a mentor to me as well as many other businesses in Chicago. This follow-up book will really help folks in the startup space define and manage to a smart and fair equity model. Look forward to reading and learning.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><i>The Abuse Algorithm </i>shares the untold stories of child sexual abuse survivors, explores how Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) impact our lives, and how this all-too-common, widespread issue is a treatable, preventable public health crisis.<br/><br/>My name is Shavontana “Starr” Davis and I am the author of <i>The Abuse Algorithm</i>. I wrote this book to make good on a promise I made as a child: to help girls like me. As an adult, that vow extends to all youth, girls and boys, heterosexual, LGBTQ+, nonbinary, those who’ve been abused, and those who have not. <br/><br/>You’ll read actual experiences from women and men around the world who have never met but are connected by this issue. You’ll also gain insight from healthcare professionals who work with abuse victims.  <br/><br/>Sexual abuse is among the most serious issues that children and youth face. The thought of it is terrifying to parents and caring adults. Addressing the problem directly and responsibly is necessary to foster appropriate awareness and prevention of this difficult topic. <br/><br/><strong>If a conversation is hard, it's probably the one worth having</strong>. Treat this book as a resource guide. Read it from cover to cover with the understanding that it is an uncomfortable read. As you read <i>The Abuse Algorithm</i>: </p>
<p>1. Carefully consider the difficult topics that will be discussed; </p>
<p>2. Continue your education and meaningful dialogue;</p>
<p>3. Pledge to utilize this tool to become a trusted adult who will listen to young people, understand their needs, and meet them where they are.</p>
<p>I believe as we make awareness and prevention a priority, and not just a reactionary response to an outcry, then we will be in a better position to protect our children and youth from child sexual abuse and exploitation.  <br/><br/><strong>I hope this book sparks change so that young people can avoid abuse, not recover from it. </strong>It's intended for parents, caring adults, and professionals entrusted with the care of young people who are committed to improving the health, wellbeing, and quality of life of children, families, and communities.<br/><br/>We invite you to join the movement to protect our young people. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>What would you do if you discovered your mother gave you up for adoption to a wise and loving, Christian woman who happened to be married to a pedophile? What would you do with this truth as you also navigate the Jim Crow South as a young, black woman?<br/><br/>My name is Acasia Olson, and I am the author of <strong><i>The Book of Jo</i></strong>. <i><strong>The Book of Jo</strong></i> is my grandmother’s story and essentially a love letter to my Granny. I wrote this book because I became a mom 2.5 years ago and wanted to explore and unpack motherhood as it was passed down to me. I wanted to understand why and how my mom raised me the way she did, and the best place to start was with her mother, my Granny. But as I sat with my grandmother’s story and what she endured and overcame, I knew I wanted to honor her and all senior survivors of childhood sexual abuse by writing her story.<br/><br/><strong>A Catch 22!</strong><br/><br/>Jo is a precocious little girl who was adopted into the loving arms of Rosa, a God-fearing, older Black woman who can’t have children of her own. But Jo lives with the world of grand opposites. While her mother loves her sacrificially and unconditionally her dad commits horrible acts to her. Jo, who lives in Birmingham Alabama’s Jim Crow Era, must navigate the world of misogyny, racism and sexual abuse all while piecing together her identity and belonging.</p>
<p><br/>Jo comes of age and becomes a young mother at the dawn of the Civil Rights Era in Birmingham, Alabama. Will she draw from the love and wisdom of her mother or crash under the waves of the pain and trauma that shape her world?<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will sit with your own generational stories. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for women and mothers and, specifically, Black women who endured and raised children under exceedingly traumatic circumstances. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you tap into compassion and courage to heal any direct or intergenerational wounds that you have noticed in yourself and your own families.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about Black Motherhood in the Jim Crow South and the effects of transgenerational trauma on parenting. You'll hear stories such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The story of my Granny’s mom, who adopted and raised her as her own flesh and blood.</li>
<li>The story of “Pandora’s Box,” a piece of furniture that hid an earth-shattering secret.</li>
<li>The story of how my Granny bypassed a 5-year waiting list to become a nurse after dropping out of high school.</li>
</ul>You will love this book if you are a mother or celebrate motherhood, miss sitting at your grandmother’s feet and listening to her stories, have southern roots, and/or can appreciate the sweet little phrases and colloquialisms found within Southern dialects.<br/><br/>The Book of Jo is a nonfiction book that speaks to families and women who want to look at motherhood, resilience, and healing from generational trauma in a new way.<br/> <p><strong>The Book - The Book of Jo</strong></p>
<p>The book is written in 3 parts.<br/><br/><i>Part 1</i> - Chapters 1 - 14 focus on Jo’s childhood, her adoption story, and her upbringing in a culture of sexual abuse and racial trauma.<br/><br/><i>Part 2</i> - Chapters 15 - 20 chronicle Jo’s journey into motherhood and marriage. We learn what she felt and knew about motherhood from her own upbringing as well as how she navigated love given her only example of fatherhood and husband in her dad.<br/><br/><i>Part 3 </i>- The final few chapters detail Jo’s return to herself after faces a few reality checks. We learn about Jo as a working mom and, specifically, what she did to earn her LPN despite dropping out of high school when she became pregnant with her first child.</p>

<h3>The Author</h3>
<p>Acasia Olson is on track to be the world’s most interesting woman by the age of 60. A military kid turned military spouse, now raising her own Navy babies, Acasia has lived in and visited over 22 countries and is on track to add another to her travel maven portfolio by the end of the year. In her past lives, she worked as a public health professional in the non-profit and government sectors, managed a federal budget, and served as an educational consultant for a children’s ministry overseas. When she’s not writing books and traveling the world, she’s busy trying to figure out how to take milestone pictures of her girls, Lavender and Laurel, who look more like blurs than humans on her camera phone.<br/><br/>Acasia has always had a book in her hand, as if it were her security blanket. A little bookworm out of the womb, Acasia has written all manner of things, some of which are in the blogosphere, and others may never see the light of day. She comes from a family of modern, self-appointed griots who enjoy oral tradition and storytelling. This is one of the reasons she felt compelled to write this story, so that her grandchildren’s children will know the courage of the women who paved the way.<br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Acasia at:</p>

What would you do if you discovered your mother gave you up for adoption to a wise and loving, Christian woman who happened to be married to a pedophile? What would you do with this truth as you also navigate the Jim Crow South as a young, black woman?My name is Acasia Olson, and I am the author of The Book of Jo. The Book of Jo is my grandmother’s story and essentially a love letter to my Granny. I wrote this book because I became a mom 2.5 years ago and wanted to explore and unpack motherhood as it was passed down to me. I wanted to understand why and how my mom raised me the way she did, and the best place to start was with her mother, my Granny. But as I sat with my grandmother’s story and what she endured and overcame, I knew I wanted to honor her and all senior survivors of childhood sexual abuse by writing her story.A Catch 22!Jo is a precocious little girl who was adopted into the loving arms of Rosa, a God-fearing, older Black woman who can’t have children of her own. But Jo lives with the world of grand opposites. While her mother loves her sacrificially and unconditionally her dad commits horrible acts to her. Jo, who lives in Birmingham Alabama’s Jim Crow Era, must navigate the world of misogyny, racism and sexual abuse all while piecing together her identity and belonging.
Jo comes of age and becomes a young mother at the dawn of the Civil Rights Era in Birmingham, Alabama. Will she draw from the love and wisdom of her mother or crash under the waves of the pain and trauma that shape her world?My hope is that, in reading this book, you will sit with your own generational stories. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for women and mothers and, specifically, Black women who endured and raised children under exceedingly traumatic circumstances. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you tap into compassion and courage to heal any direct or intergenerational wounds that you have noticed in yourself and your own families.In this book, you'll learn about Black Motherhood in the Jim Crow South and the effects of transgenerational trauma on parenting. You'll hear stories such as:

The story of my Granny’s mom, who adopted and raised her as her own flesh and blood.
The story of “Pandora’s Box,” a piece of furniture that hid an earth-shattering secret.
The story of how my Granny bypassed a 5-year waiting list to become a nurse after dropping out of high school.
You will love this book if you are a mother or celebrate motherhood, miss sitting at your grandmother’s feet and listening to her stories, have southern roots, and/or can appreciate the sweet little phrases and colloquialisms found within Southern dialects.The Book of Jo is a nonfiction book that speaks to families and women who want to look at motherhood, resilience, and healing from generational trauma in a new way. The Book - The Book of Jo
The book is written in 3 parts.Part 1 - Chapters 1 - 14 focus on Jo’s childhood, her adoption story, and her upbringing in a culture of sexual abuse and racial trauma.Part 2 - Chapters 15 - 20 chronicle Jo’s journey into motherhood and marriage. We learn what she felt and knew about motherhood from her own upbringing as well as how she navigated love given her only example of fatherhood and husband in her dad.Part 3 - The final few chapters detail Jo’s return to herself after faces a few reality checks. We learn about Jo as a working mom and, specifically, what she did to earn her LPN despite dropping out of high school when she became pregnant with her first child.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Nam Cheah and I am the author of <i>It’s a Match</i>, publishing under Samantha Cheah. I’ve always been a fan of Sci-Fi and future, and I was inspired to write this novel by reading books and watching documentaries about technology and AI, in particular <i>Homo Deus</i> and <i>The Great Hack</i>. We are entering the era of big data, where information is the most valuable currency and people are becoming more heavily reliant on technology. What if we all have an Artificial Intelligence Virtual Assistant? And what if it can cast an invisible web that connects everything and everyone?<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1626876930/xrmekxw48dpg8wybmp8a.png"" src=""""/>The story follows Sarah, a final year student in London. Sarah is the last remaining single girl in her friendship group so she decides to try online dating. After a series of bad dates, Sarah authorizes her AI Virtual Assistant to help her get online dating matches to save time. That is, until matches start approaching her in the streets and she discovers that her AIVA has been doing more than just getting online dating matches for her. It has been influencing her decisions her entire life...<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the double-edge sword of technology and its morale implications. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to envision a future that’s neither dystopian nor utopian, where people must decide if they can live with their lives being shaped by engineered fate. A decision that we all might have or have already been faced with.<br/> </p>
<h3>Why would you like this book?</h3>
<p>You will love this book if you love a light Sci-Fi that intersects with chic-lit and a sprinkle of mystery. From the decade-old struggle of online dating to being a final year student in an international university, it is a similar world to ours with futuristic technology. The characters are not too different from us, struggling with many of the same challenges we all face every day. Most romance novels make love and dating look so dramatic and easy, but it can be awkward, confusing, and daunting, (and that’s without interference of technology) and the book will reflect that.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1626877017/o9t2ep7cmlgyz0pyqm6a.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>It’s a Match</i> speaks to new and young adult who grew up with technology, and those who are on the edge and saw its rise.<strong> As someone who split half her life in Hong Kong and the other half in the UK, I also wrote this book in the hope of finding more representation of people like me in fiction. </strong>It explores the world (and minefield) of online dating, something that many of us have experienced, and how ethics and morals are not evolving fast enough to catch up with it.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>It’s a Match</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you ok with AI, big data, and algorithms influencing you in any way? And in what way?</li>
<li>How can we keep relationships of our own when Facebook (and other AIVA in the future) reminds us of birthdays and important dates?</li>
<li>We increasingly rely on AI to better our lives, but at what point does it becomes too much? And what data should be off-limits?</li>
</ul>
<p>I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers!<br/> </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Being a traditionally published author is a convoluted journey that requires a lot of querying, finding an agent, then a publisher, and you have limited control over the edits and changes they make. I have also tried self-publishing, which lets you have all the control, but I also have to self-fund and find my own contractors for editing and cover design. I was happy with my cover designer but not at all with the edits.</p>
<p><br/>My experience with writing and self-publishing means that I know my way around the book creation process and will make this story the best book it can be. This is a story that I would love to share - a fun read that also explores the moral question that technology can bring. I also offer a package for a book chat if you're interested to learn more about the process beyond being in my beta-reading group.</p>
<p><br/>Hybrid publishing is a mixed approach - funds are raised in this campaign and the New Degree Press will help me polish the book, while I get to retain the rights to my book and decide on the changes. I realize that creating a book takes a community - which is why I have this Indiegogo campaign.</p>

<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>Samantha Cheah is a pen name used by Nam Cheah for her fiction works. She is a freelance writer based in Hong Kong who has written for National Geographic, <a href=""https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/siamese-portuguese-cupcake-recipe"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">GastroObscura,</a> Whetstone, Culture Trip, Matador Network, <a href=""https://www.scmp.com/author/nam-cheah"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">South China Morning Post</a>, and her own blog <a href=""http://laughtraveleat.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Laugh Travel Eat</a> to name but a few. But her first love of writing will always be fiction.<br/><br/>Nam has been writing since she was a young girl, mostly in the genre of Sci-Fi, fantasy, and romance. She was born in Hong Kong and used to scribble stories in Chinese. When she was 11 she went to UK to study and she switched languages when her English became better than her Chinese. But it wasn’t until she found Wattpad, an online platform for writers and readers, that she started to finish novels. Under the username, then author name, Shadow Cheah, she self-published a post-apocalyptic Sci-Fi trilogy -<i> the Protectors of Earth Chronicles</i> - which has garnered a combined 2 million views on Wattpad. It took her five years to write the trilogy, and she finished it when she graduated from Imperial College London.</p>

As much as she loves the dystopian genre, she believes that the future isn’t quite as bleak. It’s a Match is an amalgamation of her love for Sci-Fi, her online dating experience, a want for diverse and POC representation that resembles the world she knows, and a version of future that she can see take place.<br/><br/>Nam had adopted the new pen name Samantha Cheah to reflect her new writing journey and to keep her freelance writing separate. It’s a Match is a book for young and new adults who have grown up in an international setting, who want to or have tried online dating, and who are reliant on technology. She doesn’t believe in the dystopian outlook of many Sci-Fi movies like i-Robot and Eagle Eyes, but the moral question of big data, AI, and algorithms should not be ignored.<br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with me at samanthacheahauthor@gmail.com, as well as through Facebook (Samantha Cheah author), and Instagram (samanthacheahauthor).<br/> </p>

The Copyediting for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.
The Launch & Promotion Efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this winter.

I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish and a handwritten thank-you note.

Your name will appear in the Acknowledgments section of my book (“with Special Thanks to”).
You will receive early access to the Introduction and some excerpts from my book, with the opportunity to review it and give me early feedback.
You will have the opportunity to be involved in selecting my cover and title.
You will be invited to join my Author Community and get behind-the-scenes sneak peeks into the publishing process.

And much more!
 

The Impact
Being a traditionally published author is a convoluted journey that requires a lot of querying, finding an agent, then a publisher, and you have limited control over the edits and changes they make. I have also tried self-publishing, which lets you have all the control, but I also have to self-fund and find my own contractors for editing and cover design. I was happy with my cover designer but not at all with the edits.
My experience with writing and self-publishing means that I know my way around the book creation process and will make this story the best book it can be. This is a story that I would love to share - a fun read that also explores the moral question that technology can bring. I also offer a package for a book chat if you're interested to learn more about the process beyond being in my beta-reading group.
Hybrid publishing is a mixed approach - funds are raised in this campaign and the New Degree Press will help me polish the book, while I get to retain the rights to my book and decide on the changes. I realize that creating a book takes a community - which is why I have this Indiegogo campaign.
 
Campaign Goals
Tier 1: Hit $6,500 and the ebook/softcover editions get published (this is the minimum needed)Tier 2: Hit $7,500 and the book will get a hardcover editionTier 3: Hit $9,500 and we’ll get an audiobook edition.
 
About the Author
Samantha Cheah is a pen name used by Nam Cheah for her fiction works. She is a freelance writer based in Hong Kong who has written for National Geographic, GastroObscura, Whetstone, Culture Trip, Matador Network, South China Morning Post, and her own blog Laugh Travel Eat to name but a few. But her first love of writing will always be fiction.Nam has been writing since she was a young girl, mostly in the genre of Sci-Fi, fantasy, and romance. She was born in Hong Kong and used to scribble stories in Chinese. When she was 11 she went to UK to study and she switched languages when her English became better than her Chinese. But it wasn’t until she found Wattpad, an online platform for writers and readers, that she started to finish novels. Under the username, then author name, Shadow Cheah, she self-published a post-apocalyptic Sci-Fi trilogy - the Protectors of Earth Chronicles - which has garnered a combined 2 million views on Wattpad. It took her five years to write the trilogy, and she finished it when she graduated from Imperial College London.
After entering the work force, Nam got busy with the other side of writing, but the pandemic has given her the opportunity to pick up her (proverbial) pen again. As much as she loves the dystopian genre, she believes that the future isn’t quite as bleak. It’s a Match is an amalgamation of her love for Sci-Fi, her online dating experience, a want for diverse and POC representation that resembles the world she knows, and a version of future that she can see take place.Nam had adopted the new pen name Samantha Cheah to reflect her new writing journey and to keep her freelance writing separate. It’s a Match is a book for young and new adults who have grown up in an international setting, who want to or have tried online dating, and who are reliant on technology. She doesn’t believe in the dystopian outlook of many Sci-Fi movies like i-Robot and Eagle Eyes, but the moral question of big data, AI, and algorithms should not be ignored.For more information, you can connect with me at samanthacheahauthor@gmail.com, as well as through Facebook (Samantha Cheah author), and Instagram (samanthacheahauthor).

Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier (within US and Hong Kong). For International Preorder, do not select the tiers, instead, make a contribution of the same amount and fill in this form.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies are expected to ship.
 

Other Ways You Can Help
Not everyone can support, but that doesn't mean you can't get something out of it!I will reward the top 3 people who refer the most backers at the end of the campaign (30 days). Here's how:
At the top of the campaign page, you will see the ""share"" buttons. Click on the ""chain"" icon to get a custom link just for you. (Note: don't use the URL in the browser window as it won't work to track referrals and you won't get credit ?)

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><i>Soar Above Life’s Turbulence</i> is a memoir that testifies the power of perseverance. We often perceive life challenges as desist letters to our progress but this book explores how holdbacks can be harnessed and transformed into opportunities. It shows how a young school dropout man (the author) became a scholar at one of the world’s top best universities through perseverance.</p>
<p>My name is Elyse Uwimpaye and I am the author of <i>Soar Above Life’s Turbulence</i>. I wrote this book because I always wanted to share with the world how holdbacks and life challenges are sometimes opportunities presented in a different form. This book will give me a platform to share and hopefully inspire people as a young man who lost his parents at age 12, started to pay his school fees at age 13, and dropped out of school at age 17 - and how that was not the end but just the beginning of life.</p>
<p><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how patience and persistence are the fuels of progress. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to learn and enhance your ability to harness life challenges and turn them into opportunities and live a life of indistractable purpose.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll encounter multifaceted dimensions of personal development hacks and perseverance tricks through narratives like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maximising commitment: featuring insights about the lessons learnt from the Chinese bamboo tree seed.</li>
<li>Being loyal to our dreams: featuring the authentic story behind ‘the why’ we start the journey. Most of the time we give up on our dreams and defy our life purpose not because we are not a good fit for it but because we don’t have a clear vision of where we want to go and why we want to go there. Start with an end in mind.</li>
<li>Seek to be better than yesterday: featuring a story of how I made a better version of myself and can be better today than yesterday.</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>You will love this book if you are a great fan of inspirational stories or a person who is limited by challenges and feel like giving up on maximising his/her potential and want to find some source of inspiration. <br/><br/><i>Soar Above Life’s Turbulence</i> not only speaks to youths who are working hard to discover their potentials but also to anyone who wants to grapple with a new way of approaching challenges and turn them into opportunities.</p>

<p><strong>About the Author</strong></p>
<p>Elyse Uwimpaye is a third-year undergraduate student at the University of Edinburgh. He is pursuing his dreams of becoming an Aerospace Engineer through double majoring in Electrical and Mechanical Engineering. Elyse grew up in a community where education was not as much a priority as farming or looking after cattle, however he was able to challenge this norm through dreaming big far beyond farming. His determination, persistence, passion, and great sense of purpose chained down everything that would limit him from achieving his dreams. Growing up with such a crazy dream, he faced numerous challenges and holdbacks which led him to temporarily drop out of school. Now, he is the first person from his entire family and his entire community to ever become a scholar at one of the top 20 best universities in the world, the University of Edinburgh.<br/><br/>Elyse wrote this book because he firmly believes that passion and persistence is key to progress, and through telling his life story, he could inspire thousands of youths out there who may be at the edge of giving up on their dreams. Through his book, he shows while there is no dream too big to come true, there will always be a price to pay to make that burning dream become a reality. Here is one of his favorite quotes from his book: “With your crazy dream, people may call abnormal but when that dream becomes a reality, your abnormality makes you extraordinary.”<br/><br/>Apart from his engineering dream, Elyse is also passionate about youth empowerment, and advocate for education for all. He is a former World Literacy Foundation Ambassador, a former mentor in Critical Thinking for Peace Camp2019, and Global Buddy Program Group Leader.</p>

Thanks for checking out my campaign! Short Summary Poison frogs are popular pets all over the world because of their beautiful coloration and a broad variety of stunning behaviors. Although most of them are relatively easy to keep, there are some things about husbandry that can be improved. Observations from their natural habitats turned out to be essential for the way we keep and breed these stunning animals. This is where I want to contribute my part:Having spent over 20 years keeping and breeding over 50 species of poison frogs and the last few years working with them in both the field and the laboratory, I would love to share my knowledge and experience. My focus will lie on Colombian poison frog species, especially on the spectacular egg feeding Oophaga sp., which are highly endangered in the Wild. Through writing and publishing, I want to contribute to improving animal well-being, help improve ex-situ conservation projects, assure that my passion for frogs and the efforts will inspire fellow hobbyists and that it serves as a guide for both beginners to professionals.A must have for everyone interested in keeping amphibians! The manuscript will contain the following topics: (Order and structure might change a bit, but not topics. Best case I add stuff, but won’t take things out!)

Guest Chapter: Conservation by Ivan Lozano of Tesoros de Colombia 

Closing remarks 
The manuscript will cover the species that I have seen in the wild and observations from each biogeographic region that I have visited. It will contain trip reports written in my personal style with my sort of humor, and have detailed glossaries as well as contain brief summaries that will be provided for each topic.   It is an honor for me to have my friend and conservationist idol contributing to the book! So for those of you who don`t know Ivan lozano, here is a brief overview of what he is doing:Ivan Lozano is a Colombian animal scientist and conservationist whose principal interest is to develop practical solutions to stop species extinctions in his country Colombia.Ivan has been an International Wildlife Management Consultant for two decades and university lecturer for 8 years.He created, and is the head of, two revolutionary conservation projects in Colombia:La Reserva Biopark and Tesoros de Colombia Sustainable Farm.The Biopark is a conservation themed park located close to Bogotá, where thousands of people, mainly children, get to understand their role in ecosystem and species conservation and welfare. It serves as a sanctuary for hundreds of wild animals rescued from the illegal traffic and has a leading ecosystem restoration project of high Andean forests.Tesoros de Colombia is a project intended to protect the poison frog species which are being smuggled out of Colombia by offering a legal and ethic alternative to this demand and breed enough animals to start reintroduction programs. Also, Tesoros wants to create reserves for some species and looks to find economic alternatives to the communities that will protect this species once reintroduced. What I need Roughly €3000 will support me in finishing writing, self-publishing both digital and paperback forms. Everything raised above that goal will be inverted in quality of the prints and additional content! When will it be published and why I am self-publishing I am aiming to publish late summer 2020, preferably end of August.This campaign is for an english version of the manuscript! A additional german version would be nice, but I would have to see how things go in terms of time and effort for the english version.I love to have control over all processes and make sure that everything lives up to my standards in terms of quality and style. I will have and will seek input from professionals though, as I understand that publishing a book is a complex and time consuming process.A whooping estimated 35% of the book is already written and/or prepared. So that at current pace, I should complete the first version of the manuscript by the end of January 2020.     Parallel to all processes, design and layout will be aligned with the requirements for the print.After that, layout, editing and complementary material such as maps, frogs and other illustrations will consume the majority of the available time.I am aiming for 50-75 pages, both sides printed, two-column text with large photographs, illustrations and maps. Format A4 (30cm x 21cm) for both the softcover and hardcover versions.This edition will be limited to maximum 50 of each available style (Softcover magazine, Hardcover Books). All signed and numbered. Due to the limited number of printed versions available they all automatically turn into something special, as it is going to be a one time project I do not intend to further commercialize.Free PDF versions of the husbandry parts will be made available to whomever might be interested in ordering to assure the following: The Impact The manuscript is aimed at improving animal well-being in terms of standards for hobbyists and professionals. As I described earlier, some new observations have not made it into the hobby yet and as with everything, there is room to improve. I am convinced I can contribute significantly to that cause. Risk and Challenges As a person with Young onset Parkinson’s disease, I might have a few bad days every once in a while. So time will have to be very well spent and thoroughly organized without overwhelming me in the process.As english is not my native language, though I’d say I am pretty ok at it, I intend to distribute part of the funds raised towards getting proof reading and editing done professionally. Other Ways You Can Help Share, share, share. Everywhere and all over social media :-) About MeMy name is Andreas Zarling, I’m a biologist, traveler, enthusiast photographer and passionate story teller! … and a long term (really close to 20 years) frog addict. Yes, a frog addict! We exist :-)For as long as I can remember, frogs have been the most interesting creatures on this planet for me. Almost 15 years after for the first time setting foot in frog territory in South America, a good friend recently approached me asking why I haven’t published my stories and observations as a book yet. After a brief moment reflecting on that, I decided that it is a great idea!My „frogger“ Curriculum vitae
I am a Herpetologist (M.Sc)
Kept and bred 50+ poison frog species and managed laboratory frog populations for a few years
Have given twelve talks about frogs to international audiences so far!
Co-produced and wrote two documentaries on poison frogs!

<p>My fascination with natural health began long before I spent many years studying it.

<p>Fast forward to today, I have spent many years teaching people how to regain and reignite their health through my naturopathy clinics where I practise with Bioresonace - body natural life synergetics.</p>

<p>For this reason (and because of the persistent encouragement of my clients) I have decided to create “<i>The Secret Kitchen Book</i>” which will help you to understand how our bodies work together with the power of nature and it cycles. I would like this book to be an inspiration to shift us from rule based eating and living to intuitive eating and then more authentic living.  </p>

<p><u><strong>Content of the Book</strong></u></p>
<p>I will address in each chapter the many cycles of nature which are reflections of our inner body power and cycles, including the moon cycle. For example regular exposure to waxing and waning moonlight has even been known to regulate ovulation and menstrual irregularities. This is because most people innately have a pretty clear understanding of the seasons of the year and perhaps even of eating summer produce in summer and autumn produce in autumn. This will take each chapter into deeper understandings of the seasonal cycles, using folk remedies as examples.</p>
<p>My aim with this book is to allow you a golden moment, where you set aside all technology, which numbs our inner cycles, and instead give yourself the gift of authentic mindful natural health, through my recipes. I also hope reading “<i>The Secret Kitchen Book</i>” will bring back memories from your childhood: memories of smells, forgotten tastes and simple happiness. </p>

<h3>Hello, my name is Nnamdi.</h3>
<p>My name is Nnamdi Nwaezeapu and I am the author of <i>Doctor, Lawyer, Engineer: How to pursue your dreams without giving your parents a heart attack. </i>I wrote this book simply because I needed it a few years ago when trying to decide whether to pursue my interests in entrepreneurship or make my parents proud and focus on law school.</p>

<h3>About The Author</h3>
<p>My name Is Nnamdi Nwaezeapu and I am passionate about helping people live happier and healthier lives. I am from Washington, DC, I hold a BA in Psychology from Columbia University, and I am currently pursuing my interests in entrepreneurship as an Account Manager for Munich-based startup company, Mindshine. I also run a small online community called the University of Good where (you guessed it) I help imperfect people learn how to live happier and healthier lives (see: universityofgood.com).<br/><br/>I am the child of Nigerian and Bahamian immigrants. Like many children of immigrants, my parents impressed upon me, both subtly and overtly, that the Ivy league was my future and that a career in law would be a great way to earn a living, to earn them social standing, and to earn myself their love and affection. But after getting into Columbia Law School (with a scholarship) and still feeling unfulfilled, I sought out answers about what I should do. Aside from the occasional blog post, there was no real help to be found. So I wrote this book to solve this problem.<br/><br/>Now, it is important to note that despite the fact that I will be a published author in December, it is very apparent that my family largely still considers me to be a failure.

My name is Nnamdi Nwaezeapu and I am the author of Doctor, Lawyer, Engineer: How to pursue your dreams without giving your parents a heart attack. I wrote this book simply because I needed it a few years ago when trying to decide whether to pursue my interests in entrepreneurship or make my parents proud and focus on law school.
My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how to chart your own path without sacrificing the success and economic stability that your parents so desire. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for building a fulfilling life. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you design your ideal life, all while keeping your parents from experiencing existential anguish.

Here's what you'll be reading about:
In this book, you'll learn about employment outcomes for the legal, medical, and engineering professions, as well as hear stories and strategies around cultivating your passions while managing the psychological and relational impacts of immigrant and first-gen culture.

You will read about Pierre LaGuerre, a first-generation immigrant from Haiti, who exchanged his parents dream of becoming a Neuroscientist at Harvard, to become a truck driver, and eventually going on to found a prominent tech startup
You will learn from Yvonne Orji, the comedian and actress in the above clip, who traded med school for a career in comedy, and eventually ended up as a main character on popular HBO show, Insecure.
You will also read papers from researchers like psychologist, Mary Odafe, who has conducted extensive studies on the psychological impacts of immigrant parenting styles on various psychopathologies such as maladaptive perfectionism.

 
You will love this book if:

You are unsure about law, medicine, or engineering as a profession.
You are a parent or mentor trying to help someone make a decision about what to do with their future.
You want to pursue your dreams, but you are unsure how to do so without bringing heaping amounts of shame to yourself and to your family.

 
The Book - Doctor, Lawyer, Engineer: How to pursue your dreams without giving your parents a heart attack.
Doctor, Lawyer, Engineer  is a non-fiction book that speaks to those who want to build a fulfilling life and to their parents and mentors who, many for the first time, are looking at how they can help, and whether they should.

About The Author
My name Is Nnamdi Nwaezeapu and I am passionate about helping people live happier and healthier lives. I am from Washington, DC, I hold a BA in Psychology from Columbia University, and I am currently pursuing my interests in entrepreneurship as an Account Manager for Munich-based startup company, Mindshine. I also run a small online community called the University of Good where (you guessed it) I help imperfect people learn how to live happier and healthier lives (see: universityofgood.com).I am the child of Nigerian and Bahamian immigrants. Like many children of immigrants, my parents impressed upon me, both subtly and overtly, that the Ivy league was my future and that a career in law would be a great way to earn a living, to earn them social standing, and to earn myself their love and affection. But after getting into Columbia Law School (with a scholarship) and still feeling unfulfilled, I sought out answers about what I should do. Aside from the occasional blog post, there was no real help to be found. So I wrote this book to solve this problem.Now, it is important to note that despite the fact that I will be a published author in December, it is very apparent that my family largely still considers me to be a failure. Okay maybe not a failure, but you get the idea.
Thus, while I still love them very much, I would greatly appreciate your support in helping to make this book be a success. For their sake, and mine.

Then ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you spark fascinating conversations on space exploration - conversations that are critical to ensuring that the missions of tomorrow leave the drawing board and launch into the stars.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn how to have meaningful conversations on space without a doctorate degree in astrophysics. You'll be able to refute common objections to space exploration and demonstrate to others the importance of the missions of tomorrow. Among other things, you'll learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>The curiosity and sense of exploration that have propelled humanity to greatness. Through exercises such as understanding humanity's birthday on the Cosmic Calendar, you will discover that these instincts are within you too!</li>
<li>The threats to humankind's presence on Earth and how the myriad of past, current, and future missions around our Solar System are redefining how we understand these threats.</li>
<li>How the financing of space exploration is largely misunderstood and how many of our favorite science fiction novels, tv shows, and movies are not as far from reality as we may think.</li>
<li>What a Martian colony may look like, what a floating city in Venus may look like, and what other destinations humanity may one day call home.</li>

In Part 1, you will learn why humanity is on the brink of the next golden age of space exploration, why the quest to become a multi-planetary species is driven by the instincts that make us human, and why this ambition is necessary to ensure the survival of humanity. You will discover your innate sense of curiosity by learning humanity's birthday on the Cosmic Calendar, see how the sense of exploration that has propelled our species from the plains of Africa to the stars will drive us to become multi-planetary, and understand the existential threats that could potentially cripple our species.<br/><br/><strong>2. Part Two</strong> contains Chapters 3-6. In these chapters, you will be given a comprehensive overview of humanity's presence in space today. You will learn about the most important missions are currently operating in the stars in chapter 3, about the benefits that such missions are yielding to humanity on Earth in chapter 4, about how these missions are financed in chapter 5, and about how science fiction is playing a critical role in sparking enthusiasm for future missions in chapter 6.

Chapter 7 will bring you onto the first human colony on Mars and show you how the brave explorers of tomorrow will survive on our favorite cosmological neighbor.

<h3>¿Qué?</h3>
<p><strong>El cuaderno de Zineb</strong><i> </i>es una novela corta ambientada en los años ochenta en la ciudad de Santa Cruz de Tenerife.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">El profesor Gonzalo Arenas cuenta en primera persona, desde la perspectiva del narrador testigo, cómo fue su relación con algunos de los personajes del relato. Por un lado, está Zineb, una alumna árabe que ha llegado a las islas con su familia con el objetivo de buscarse la vida en un lugar mejor. Las clases de Educación Compensatoria a las que asiste deben servirle para encauzar su vida en el futuro, acceder a otros estudios superiores y llegar, si es posible, a la universidad. Sus ojos brillantes de color verde enamoran al profesor Gonzalo Arenas, el narrador que cuenta lo que va sucediendo a medida que avanza el curso.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">La llegada de Julián Álvarez dará al traste con algunos de los objetivos que se había marcado el profesor Arenas. Julián Álvarez es un joven profesor, apuesto e inteligente, que proviene de la universidad, de donde lo han echado por algún turbio asunto. Es también fotógrafo y en los últimos meses ha disfrutado de una beca en La Habana, donde ha estudiado fotografía en la Escuela Internacional de Cine de San Antonio de los Baños, a unos kilómetros de la capital. La relación entre Gonzalo Arenas y Julián Álvarez se irá afianzando, pero también complicando, en la medida en que los dos pretenderán a la misma mujer, Carolina, una profesora de inglés del mismo instituto.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Poco a poco, la verdadera protagonista de la historia, Zineb, se irá mostrando ante el lector más allá de sus simples cuadernos de redacción, como una mujer que esconde un gran secreto.</p>
<h3>¿Quiénes?</h3>
<p><strong>Tandaia</strong> es una editorial con voluntad de cambio, de dar la alternativa a autores que no la encuentran en otro lugar, con nuevas y refrescantes ideas como es el emplear una campaña preventa para valorar la aceptación y viabilidad de cada título.</p>
<p>De este modo eres tú, ahora que te estás planteando cómo colaborar, el que decide si la obra que te presentamos verá la luz pasando a formar parte de nuestro catálogo... porque consideramos al lector parte fundamental del proceso.</p>
<p>Hoy te presentamos a <strong>José Antonio Leal Canales</strong>.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Ha simultaneado el cultivo del relato breve y la novela corta, géneros a los que pertenecen «<i>El Valbanera o la esperanza</i>»<i> </i>(Premio Felipe Trigo, Universitas, 1987), «<i>Cita en La Habana</i>»<i> </i>(E.R.E., La Gaveta, 1998), «<i>Maneras de morir</i>»<i> </i>(Premio Rafael González Castell, Diputación de Badajoz, 2002), «<i>La sal en los labios</i>» (E.R.E, 2013), así como otros muchos relatos publicados en diferentes antologías y revistas.<br/>            En cuanto a las novelas, ha publicado la novela negra <i>Los pasos del camaleón </i>(Imagine, 2005), <i>El fuego y las cenizas </i>(Imagine, 2008)<i>, </i>obra con la que ganó el Premio Internacional de Novela Seseña,  <i>El testimonio del becario </i>(Algaida, 2009), con la que obtuvo el XIII Premio de novela Ciudad de Badajoz y <i>La colombiana </i>(Norbanova, 2016).<br/>            Ha recibido varios premios de cuentos y relatos, como el Barcarola (1988), Miguel de Unamuno (1989), Emiliano Barral (1990), Mislata (1990) y Benasque (2009), entre otros.</p>
<h3>¿Por qué?</h3>
<p>Y por aquí una muestra de lo que encontraréis en sus páginas:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">«Sus ojos me habían llamado la atención cuando pasaba lista el primer día de clase. No supe entonces, en el preciso instante, a qué otros ojos me recordaban. Fue algún tiempo después cuando caí en el parecido evidente. Sus ojos eran los mismos que los de Sharbat Gula, una niña afgana de apenas doce años, que Steve McCurry había fotografiado en el campamento de refugiados de Nasir Bagh durante la guerra contra la invasión soviética. Su imagen apareció en la portada de National Geographic en junio de 1985. Dieciocho años más tarde la fotografiaría de nuevo, tras una búsqueda ardua por el país de las montañas, último refugio de Bin Laden. Tenía ya treinta años cuando la encontró. Se había casado con un hombre también afgano y era madre de tres hijos. Parecía una mujer mayor, a pesar de que sus ojos seguían siendo los mismos. Sin el brillo de la infancia, pero los mismos. Sin la rebeldía descarada que proporciona el atrevimiento de la ingenuidad, pero aún sombreados con la pátina de la inquietud que siempre genera en la mirada la belleza. Aunque a la postre domesticados, al fin sometidos, amansados ante el rigor implacable de los años duros de la posguerra, subordinados a la autoridad incuestionable de un marido que habría consentido la fotografía seguramente a cambio de unos cuantos dólares.<br/>           Pero no era de Sharbat Gula de quien quería hablar, sino de Zineb. Tenía los mismos ojos de Sharbat».</p>
<h3>¿Cómo?</h3>
<p>Para arrancar el proyecto nos hemos fijado como objetivo 880€; esta es la cantidad que recaudaríamos si alrededor de cincuenta mecenas se hiciesen, cada cual, con un ejemplar de esta primera edición.</p>
<ul>
<li>Teniendo acceso a las galeradas de edición.</li>
<li>Recibiendo un ejemplar semanas antes de la salida al mercado de la obra.</li>
<li>Si bien, también podrías ver tu nombre en los agradecimientos aportando un poco más.</li>
</ul>
<p>Los fondos recaudados, se utilizarán como ayuda para sacar adelante esta primera edición de <i>El cuaderno de Zineb</i> que saldría después a la venta.</p>

</div></div>","¿Qué?
El cuaderno de Zineb es una novela corta ambientada en los años ochenta en la ciudad de Santa Cruz de Tenerife.
El profesor Gonzalo Arenas cuenta en primera persona, desde la perspectiva del narrador testigo, cómo fue su relación con algunos de los personajes del relato. Por un lado, está Zineb, una alumna árabe que ha llegado a las islas con su familia con el objetivo de buscarse la vida en un lugar mejor. Las clases de Educación Compensatoria a las que asiste deben servirle para encauzar su vida en el futuro, acceder a otros estudios superiores y llegar, si es posible, a la universidad. Sus ojos brillantes de color verde enamoran al profesor Gonzalo Arenas, el narrador que cuenta lo que va sucediendo a medida que avanza el curso.
La llegada de Julián Álvarez dará al traste con algunos de los objetivos que se había marcado el profesor Arenas. Julián Álvarez es un joven profesor, apuesto e inteligente, que proviene de la universidad, de donde lo han echado por algún turbio asunto. Es también fotógrafo y en los últimos meses ha disfrutado de una beca en La Habana, donde ha estudiado fotografía en la Escuela Internacional de Cine de San Antonio de los Baños, a unos kilómetros de la capital. La relación entre Gonzalo Arenas y Julián Álvarez se irá afianzando, pero también complicando, en la medida en que los dos pretenderán a la misma mujer, Carolina, una profesora de inglés del mismo instituto.
Poco a poco, la verdadera protagonista de la historia, Zineb, se irá mostrando ante el lector más allá de sus simples cuadernos de redacción, como una mujer que esconde un gran secreto.
¿Quiénes?
Tandaia es una editorial con voluntad de cambio, de dar la alternativa a autores que no la encuentran en otro lugar, con nuevas y refrescantes ideas como es el emplear una campaña preventa para valorar la aceptación y viabilidad de cada título.
De este modo eres tú, ahora que te estás planteando cómo colaborar, el que decide si la obra que te presentamos verá la luz pasando a formar parte de nuestro catálogo... porque consideramos al lector parte fundamental del proceso.
Hoy te presentamos a José Antonio Leal Canales.
Ha simultaneado el cultivo del relato breve y la novela corta, géneros a los que pertenecen «El Valbanera o la esperanza» (Premio Felipe Trigo, Universitas, 1987), «Cita en La Habana» (E.R.E., La Gaveta, 1998), «Maneras de morir» (Premio Rafael González Castell, Diputación de Badajoz, 2002), «La sal en los labios» (E.R.E, 2013), así como otros muchos relatos publicados en diferentes antologías y revistas.            En cuanto a las novelas, ha publicado la novela negra Los pasos del camaleón (Imagine, 2005), El fuego y las cenizas (Imagine, 2008), obra con la que ganó el Premio Internacional de Novela Seseña,  El testimonio del becario (Algaida, 2009), con la que obtuvo el XIII Premio de novela Ciudad de Badajoz y La colombiana (Norbanova, 2016).            Ha recibido varios premios de cuentos y relatos, como el Barcarola (1988), Miguel de Unamuno (1989), Emiliano Barral (1990), Mislata (1990) y Benasque (2009), entre otros.
¿Por qué?
Y por aquí una muestra de lo que encontraréis en sus páginas:
«Sus ojos me habían llamado la atención cuando pasaba lista el primer día de clase. No supe entonces, en el preciso instante, a qué otros ojos me recordaban. Fue algún tiempo después cuando caí en el parecido evidente. Sus ojos eran los mismos que los de Sharbat Gula, una niña afgana de apenas doce años, que Steve McCurry había fotografiado en el campamento de refugiados de Nasir Bagh durante la guerra contra la invasión soviética. Su imagen apareció en la portada de National Geographic en junio de 1985. Dieciocho años más tarde la fotografiaría de nuevo, tras una búsqueda ardua por el país de las montañas, último refugio de Bin Laden. Tenía ya treinta años cuando la encontró. Se había casado con un hombre también afgano y era madre de tres hijos. Parecía una mujer mayor, a pesar de que sus ojos seguían siendo los mismos. Sin el brillo de la infancia, pero los mismos. Sin la rebeldía descarada que proporciona el atrevimiento de la ingenuidad, pero aún sombreados con la pátina de la inquietud que siempre genera en la mirada la belleza. Aunque a la postre domesticados, al fin sometidos, amansados ante el rigor implacable de los años duros de la posguerra, subordinados a la autoridad incuestionable de un marido que habría consentido la fotografía seguramente a cambio de unos cuantos dólares.           Pero no era de Sharbat Gula de quien quería hablar, sino de Zineb. Tenía los mismos ojos de Sharbat».
¿Cómo?
Para arrancar el proyecto nos hemos fijado como objetivo 880€; esta es la cantidad que recaudaríamos si alrededor de cincuenta mecenas se hiciesen, cada cual, con un ejemplar de esta primera edición.

Teniendo acceso a las galeradas de edición.
Recibiendo un ejemplar semanas antes de la salida al mercado de la obra.
Si bien, también podrías ver tu nombre en los agradecimientos aportando un poco más.

Los fondos recaudados, se utilizarán como ayuda para sacar adelante esta primera edición de El cuaderno de Zineb que saldría después a la venta.
Aviso para navegantes: La opción RESPALDAR es únicamente para realizar donaciones a la edición, por lo que no habrá comunicaciones posteriores en busca de datos de envío... cualquiera de las opciones válidas de reserva exige cumplimentar formulario para poder servir el pedido.
Además...
Sabemos que son tiempos difíciles, también nosotros los sufrimos, y es posible que no te encuentres en disposición de apoyarnos con tu mecenazgo en estos momentos... pero esperamos que si esto te ha llegado al alma, incluso si tal vez conoces en persona al autor, trates de difundir esta campaña (facebook, twitter, blogger, boca-oreja... ) para que alcancemos nuestra meta y José Antonio Leal Canales vea publicada su obra.
Gracias por vuestro tiempo.

<h3>Who are you, and what is this book about?</h3>
<p>Great question! Here are the basic details:</p>
<ul>
<li>My name is Lloyd Evans. I am a former Jehovah's Witness elder from the UK. I am 37 years old, and currently living in Croatia with my beautiful wife and daughter. I am Senior Editor of JWsurvey.org, which is aimed at providing a resource for Jehovah's Witnesses who are beginning to awaken from their indoctrination. JWsurvey currently attracts 110,000 visits per month. I also create videos for the ""John Cedars"" YouTube channel, which currently has over 10,000 subscribers.</li>
<li>My campaign aims to pay the final costs for getting my book The Reluctant Apostate into print. This book is very important to me because, not only does it document my story of growing up as a Witness and finally leaving the religion - it also provides readers with a candid history of the religion and up-to-date overview of its beliefs and practices.</li>
<li>By getting this book launched in January 2017 (or possibly earlier) there is a real chance that we can reach out to indoctrinated Jehovah's Witnesses and give them the information they need to break free of cultic undue influence. We can also help inoculate the wider public (the primary audience the book is written for) against ever getting entangled with the Watchtower organization, with its harmful policies (i.e. shunning, blood prohibition, child abuse mishandling).</li>
</ul>
<p>I am hopeful that, with your help, this book will make a real difference!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need to raise $1,470 to pay for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>$500 in fees for a friend who is in the process of creating a beautiful design for the book, so that it is visually-pleasing as well as content-rich.</li>
<li>$585 to cover the costs of an initial print-run of 100 books, including fuel to go collect the books directly from the printers.</li>
<li>$250 to buy 10 ISBN numbers to officially register this book and future editions/translations.</li>
<li>$135 to cover the total anticipated fees taken by Indiegogo and PayPal for the above amounts.</li>
</ul>
<p>In exchange for helping me reach this goal, my backers can receive:</p>
<ul>
<li>For a $5 donation (toward making the project happen): my appreciation!</li>
<li>For $19: an advance copy of The Reluctant Apostate (before it is released on Amazon).</li>
<li>For $25: a signed advance copy of The Reluctant Apostate (before it is released on Amazon).</li>
<li>For $45: a signed advance copy of The Reluctant Apostate (before it is released on Amazon) with the backer's name in the Acknowledgments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any excess funds pledged will go toward printing and mailing extra books for reviewers, promoting the book, and otherwise assisting with my activism work (including upgrading equipment, paying web hosting costs, and buying a new 12-month subscription to the SurveyMonkey service for the JWsurvey.org Global Survey of Jehovah's Witnesses).</p>
<p>If I do not reach my goal, any funds will go toward meeting what costs I can, and I will explore alternative ways of raising the remaining money.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In case you are wondering why there is a need for this campaign, or what difference your contribution will make...</p>
<ul>
<li>There are currently 8 million Jehovah's Witnesses worldwide, many of whom have been raised in their religion from birth and never exposed to information that objectively scrutinizes their beliefs. This book offers a thorough debunking of the main Witness teachings and practices. It even has ""For Witnesses"" boxes with key points for indoctrinated Witnesses to consider.</li>
<li>The organization behind the Witnesses is intent on spreading its influence and attracting more converts from among those never raised as Witnesses. This book will assist those with little or no knowledge of the religion to prepare against ever getting roped in to the faith, perhaps at a time when they are emotionally vulnerable (which is when cults are most effective at recruiting).</li>
<li>By backing this project, you are supporting someone with (1) the knowledge and experience to tackle the subject, (2) the determination to make this book as thorough, readable and enjoyable as it can possibly be, (3) an established track record in anti-cult activism, and (4) a large audience that can give the book the head start it needs to be successful.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Whenever you involve multiple people in a project, there are bound to be risks. But I am being careful to only use the services of experienced colleagues known for their high standards. I also intend to check quality at every stage. For example, I will be ordering sample copies of The Reluctant Apostate from the printers to make sure the copies I will be sending out are printed to the same high standard I would expect. </p>
<p>As for the book itself, a team of 10 editors, some of whom have professional editing experience, are helping me with checking the quality of the text and making sure the spelling, grammar and punctuation are all up to a suitable standard.</p>
<p>I have every confidence that the finished book will be enjoyed by many, and I take my duty to send out copies to my backers extremely seriously.</p>
<p>In short:</p>
<ul>
<li>I am working with the right people, who are just as passionate about this project as I am.</li>
<li>I have extremely high standards for this book. I am not writing a book just for the sake of it - I want the finished article to make its mark on the planet and stand the test of time!</li>
<li>In the worst case scenario, I have other options for raising the needed funds. However, an Indiegogo campaign seems like the best way to let my supporters get involved and receive a special reward for their generosity.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>It might be that you are not in a position to order a book, or donate money. If so, you can still help me in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can share links to this Indiegogo campaign (or the trailer video) on Reddit, or on Facebook and Twitter. Doing this is ALWAYS appreciated!</li>
<li>You can spread the word among any friends, family or work colleagues who might be interested in reading the book, or backing the project.</li>
</ul>
</div><p>However you decide to get behind the project, you have my sincere gratitude!</p></div>","Who are you, and what is this book about?

<p>
<font size=""3""> Friends, I need your help to respond to an urgent cry from Christians of the Holy Land!  Many of these are people I know personally.  I've worshipped with them in Bethlehem and Jerusalem. I have been a guest in their homes and have seen first-hand the confiscation of their land and water, the destruction of their businesses,  and attempts to humiliate them at checkpoints built deep inside their own territory.

       These realities are not discussed in our newspapers, but are very real nonetheless, and are confirmed by many human rights organizations, missionaries, and witnesses of every faith.  Americans cannot begin to imagine the hardship Christians and Muslims of the Holy Land face under Israel's occupation.  The freedoms we take for granted here are denied to these warm and dignified people, simply because of their ethnicity.  Even water is distributed according to ethnic group in the occupied territories, with Israelis receiving <u>four times</u> as much water as Palestinians!  </font></p>

<p><font size=""3"">Palestinian Christians have urged us in a beautiful letter called the ""Kairos Palestine Document"" to put actions behind our words for a just peace.  I hope you'll support ""Kairos Response,"" a broad grassroots movement in the United Methodist Church which seeks to remove a contradiction between our church's words and actions.  We are setting an example for others to follow by urging removal of church funds from a small group of companies that play a direct role in the occupation.  These are not Israeli companies, and the measure does not involve divestment from Israel.  In fact, we have the support of many Jewish groups, rabbis and Israelis.  </font></p>

Gedruckt wird, wenn es uns gelingt, an dieser Stelle genügend Käufer für das Magazin zu finden. Für 11,00 Euro kannst du hier ab sofort unser Magazin bestellen. Damit sorgst du dafür, dass zahlreiche Geschichten zur Frage 'Was ist Zuhause?' das Licht der Welt erblicken. Und du leistest einen wertvollen Beitrag, den Markt der Independent Magazine um ein besonderes Gesellschaftsmagazin reicher zu machen. Seit 2013 – neugierig, lebendig und persönlichBereits seit April 2013 erzählt und bespricht ROSEGARDEN als Online-Magazin auf Talk-Veranstaltungen und im Radio die Themen, Ideen und Menschen unserer Tage. Ob Sharing Economy, Pop-Up Kultur, Multioptionalität, Musik, Bücher, Design oder Kunst – Rosegarden betrachtet unabhängig, neugierig, subjektiv, ironisch, klug, streitbar und lebendig die Welt, in der wir uns bewegen. Doch kein Glamour ohne dich: Unsere Themen sind persönlich. Mal reflektieren wir über Berlin, mal erklären wir die Foodie-Sprache, mal treffen wir Sophie Auster oder stellen euch das Kalecollective vor. Unsere Geschichten sind das, was unsere Leser leben. Jeden Tag. Sie sind der wahre Lifestyle unserer Zeit.Ein Heft sagt mehr als tausend KlicksNach vier digitalen Ausgaben, fast 300 Beiträgen, die über 40.000 Mal gelesen wurden, haben wir festgestellt, dass manche Themen mehr Raum brauchen als ein Lesezeichen im Browser. Sie gehören abgedruckt auf Papier, wo sie in Ruhe gelesen, wieder gelesen und vielleicht weitergegeben werden können.Titelthema: ""Was ist Zuhause?""Passend dazu vielleicht auch das Titelthema unserer ersten Printausgabe für die zahlreiche Autoren, Fotografen und Illustratoren bewegende, verblüffende und spannende Beiträge geliefert haben. Auf 116 Seiten bietet das Heft einen umfassenden Einblick in die Frage, was Zuhause heute bedeuten kann.Sneak Preview: Ein Blick ins HeftZuhause im Bürgerkrieg.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Miranda Doerfler, a 21 year old horror, espionage, mystery and thriller writer. I am doing everything I can to reach my goals, and that's what this campaign is about.</p>
<p>I recently wrote a zombie thriller novella called DEAD INSIDE, which I was lucky enough to get a publisher for. However, there are some printing and initial fees that go with getting the book published and getting it out there, and I need some help in covering those fees.</p>
<p>It's been a dream of mine to be published since I was seven years old, and this will be my first commercial publication. I'm hoping this will kick off my career as a writer.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This campaign is to raise $1000, total. About a third of that goes to publication fees, while the rest goes to paying the cover artist for his work, ordering copies, having keychains made and promoting the book.</p>
<p>The perks include the aforementioned limited edition keychains, copies of the ebook version of DEAD INSIDE, copies of my upcoming zombie short DECAY and a few autographed paperbacks of DEAD INSIDE.</p>
<p>If I don't reach my entire goal, anything I make will go to the publication fees and ordering copies of DEAD INSIDE for sales and promotion.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This is really about helping an ambitious indie writer who refuses to give up her dream of being published. I want this more than anything, and knowing that I have support means so much to me.</p>
<p>I have had the honor of being on an author panel at a zombie convention recently to promote DEAD INSIDE and discuss it with an audience of about 50 people, and in the company of four other authors.</p>
<p>I intend to continue attending conventions whenever I can to speak on panels about this book, as well as doing whatever I'm able to do to promote it. It's the most important thing to me, and reaching this campaign goal will help immensely.</p>

Since I know many of you are getting books as gifts, here's a <strong>unique and special perk </strong>to go with your Holiday Special: a short story from the Stories of the Third Brother collection about how Alaren halts a war on a magical night with a fiddle, a fire, and a great deal of courage.</p>
<p><strong>Community Publisher's Outtake:</strong> Gems of chapters are put to the side in the process of creating a novel.

<p><strong>Vision. Courage. Love.</strong> That's the recipe for my novels... and for the community of people, like yourself, who bring them into the world. <strong><i>The Lost Heir </i>is a fantasy with a purpose</strong>, swapping out swords for the tools of modern heroes and sheroes who follow in the mythic footsteps of people like Gandhi, King, Chavez, Dolores Huerta, Leymah Gbowee, and millions more. I'm a writer on a quest: to create loveable stories with strong sheroes (and heroes) that use nonviolence to wage peace and work for justice.</p>
<p>It's a tall order. But we're doing it. <strong>When we brought <i>The Way Between </i>into existence, children around the country and across the world fell in love with this story</strong>. I've received letters and photos, notes from parents and grandparents, paintings and drawings of Ari Ara. Grown men have told me they wept their way through its heartwarming story.</p>
<p><strong>Clearly, we're onto something.</strong></p>
<p>My editor says <i>The Lost Heir </i>is even better than <i>The Way Between. </i>High praise from a one-time skeptic of this series who then cried like a baby after reading the first book. He says this novel shows the power we all have inside to work for justice with nonviolence. He says the plot twist at the end (and no, I'm not going to tell you) is so moving he almost couldn't breathe - even reading the scene for the second (or tenth) time.</p>
<p><strong>Here's my hope</strong>: that you'll get a copy for yourself... and that <strong>you'll introduce a new young person to these books. Give a gift that inspires the next generation</strong>. Give the gift of strong characters - both real and fictional - to a world that desperately needs them. You can also donate a copy to your local library. It's a great way to give this book to hundreds of people all at once.</p>

Ari Ara Needs You! Bring a Great Novel Into the World!

This is the story your heart's been longing to hear! Let's bring this magical book into the world.

With all the fun of a sword-swinging adventure, but without the violence, The Lost Heir spins a spectacular story with strong female characters and powerful social justice themes. Young Ari Ara has been discovered to be the Lost Heir, the double royal daughter of two nations. When she learns that her mother's people have forced her father's desert people to sell their labor in exchange for water, she sets out on a quest for justice. 'Armed' with nonviolence and love, Ari Ara launches a youth movement to restore the honor and dignity of both her peoples. Unexpected allies rush to her side: the urchin queen, a monkish young scholar, a desert seamstress, and a mysterious hawk keeper. Before she knows it, she's sparked an uprising like nothing Mariana Capital has ever seen!
A shero with spunk and spark, Ari Ara confronts prejudice, discrimination, bullying, violence, and injustice with all the action, adventure, magic, and fantasy that readers love!
Kids, parents, and teachers agree: you'll love this book!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>In the Age of AI explores Artificial intelligence and the impact it will have on society and the economy. It argues that AI will transform society in many positive ways, but the consequence of that transformation will displace millions of jobs.<br/><br/>My name is Sam Mielke and I am the author of In The Age of AI. I wrote this book because I recognized that AI will cause every industry to go through incredible changes that we aren’t ready for. I also wrote this book to give you a detailed overview of how emerging technologies will affect the future of work.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that artificial intelligence is not something to ignore, but rather something to embrace and get “ahead of the pack” by dedicating time to learning how it will impact society. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for the future of technology. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you navigate this ever-changing world of technology and what you can do to prepare for it.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about AI and the impacts it has on jobs and why this technological change is different from previous ones. You'll read...</p>
<p>A story from Elon Musk about his first-hand experience with AI and how it scared him</p>
<p>A story about why Ray Kurzweil believes we may have the technical capabilities to make everyone double their lifespan by 2029 and then forever by 2045.</p>
<p>An interesting story from Mark Cuban about how AI is bigger than anything in history and what he advises all people do about it to prepare.</p>
<p>You will love this book if you want to be prepared for the AI revolution, enjoy learning about the future and are interested in technology.<br/><br/>In The Age of AI is a nonfiction book that speaks to young people pondering their career choices, as well as workers in every industry who want to look at technology and the future of work in a new way.</p>
<h3>The Book</h3>
<p>The book is written in 3 parts.<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the introduction + chapters 1-2. The first chapter explores what AI is and its history. It will give you a savvy understanding of AI and how many emerging technologies are evolving to change the world. Chapter 2 looks at the history of job displacement including the industrial revolution which is often compared to this AI revolution. I’ll explain why this change is different and the reasons automation will displace millions of jobs.<br/><br/>Part 2 contains chapters 3-9. In this section, each chapter will be dedicated to an industry where I analyze the impact AI has on the specific industry and subsequently the way it will impact jobs. This section includes numerous expert interviews and interesting stories that provide more opinions on the future.<br/><br/>Part 3 contains chapters 10-11. Here we take a look at the solutions to job displacement and the ways in which you can better prepare yourself for the impending change.</p>

<h3><strong>UPDATE:</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Today is the final day of my campaign!</strong></p>
<p>I am really quite close to my initial goal — as of 7am, I am at $2,944, out of the $3,500 wished for!</p>
<p><strong>I would really love to get the funds to $3,000.</strong> I think, if I am very careful, I could almost completely cover the cost of the trip with $3,000.</p>
<p>So, <strong>I’ve come up with one more perk</strong> to perhaps entice you on this last leg of the campaign! <span class=""caps"">ANY</span> contribution (over $1) made today will receive a nice, thickly-printed bookmark, designed by Sebastian (an extremely talented visual artist) and I, with my favorite poem (can you guess what it might be?) inscribed on the back.</p>

<h3><strong><span class=""caps"">UPDATE</span>:</strong></h3>
<p>In the first week following the launch of my campaign, I made over $1000. I find this astonishing. I have many generous friends. And I’ve found the world to be full of generous strangers. And I want to be generous, as well.</p>
<p>So I thought on it, and I’ve created a few more “perks” for my donors to choose from. If you have already donated in one of the amounts indicated below, have no fear! You can retroactively select a perk that matches your donation. I think I should be able to keep track of all of this through indiegogo — you might keep an eye out there for a message from me, if I don’t have your personal email…</p>
<p><strong>$35</strong><br/><strong> Summer Roadtrip Playlist</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the Postcard from Prague, you will also receive a link for a downloadable playlist of roadtrip music, carefully compiled by me.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>$100</strong><br/><strong> Personalized Reading List</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the postcard and playlist, you will also receive a reading list of 5 recommended books, selected especially for you and your reading adventures. Titles will be chosen per a questionnaire / email correspondence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And this is the one that I, personally, am most excited about…</p>
<p><strong>$250</strong><br/><strong> Online Writing Workshop*</strong></p>
<p>In this four week seminar / workshop hybrid, we will closely read through a range of short works and examine what a short story can be, and the various ways in which we might write one. You will receive feedback on assigned writing exercises, as well as a thorough, thoughtful written response to two works of short fiction submitted during the course.</p>
<p>*The course will focus primarily on short fiction, and will run (tentatively) through the month of January in 2013.</p>

<h3><strong><br/></strong></h3>
<h3><strong><br/></strong></h3>
<h3><strong><br/></strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Hello!</strong></h3>
<p><strong><br/></strong>I am Chelsea, a writer of fiction, a student of writing, and mama to two little boys.  For the longest time, I thought I only wanted to write short stories.  I love the form, the compactness of them, the fact that I can write them during the course of a nap.  But over this past year, in my MFA workshops, I realized that I was essentially writing the same voice in my stories over and over again.  And I realized that this voice, this character, she needs a novel. </p>
<p>Much of the book comes from stuff familiar to me -- a small-town Midwestern setting, the experience of a religious Roman Catholic upbringing, the weird world of beauty pageants, a pilgrimage to an apparition site.</p>
<p>But there are also elements of the book that I feel I needed more understanding of, in order to write them authentically: Namely, where and when my fictional apparition of the Virgin Mary would occur. </p>
<p>After months of digging around in the library, I found my way to Bílá Voda, a small village in the Czech Republic. </p>
<p>When the Communist Regime took power in the Czech Republic after World War II, thirteen different orders of nuns were pulled from their work in schools and orphanages and hospitals and were exiled to a monastery in Bílá Voda.  They lived there together until the fall of Communism in 1989.  Some still live there today.</p>
<p>This place and time -- Bílá Voda at the start of the Velvet Revolution – are really historically perfect for an apparition of the Virgin Mary to occur.  I feel so lucky to have found my way here.  But I am at a point where I feel I have exhausted the research I can do in libraries.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>The Plan</strong></h3>
<p>I am preparing for a two week trip to the Czech Republic at the end of summer.  I need to spend some time in Bílá Voda, speak with the nuns, walk the streets of the village, get a sense of the place, before I can move forward in writing it.  Next year is my last in the MFA program, and, after staying at home with my boys for three years, I know that I will never again have a time so dedicated to writing, with the support and thoughtful feedback of my talented peers and teachers. </p>
<p>This is my time for writing this book.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>What I need and What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>My fundraising goal for this campaign is $3,500.  This will help to cover airfare, ground transportation in the Czech Republic, and the cost of a translator. </p>
<p>As the mother of a young family living on a restaurant server’s wages in New York City, all help in making this magic happen will be deeply appreciated! </p>
<p>While any and all donations will receive my warmest gratitude, donors of $20 or more will receive a 5x7 “postcard” photograph from the Czech Republic, taken and printed by me. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>

<p> </p></div>","UPDATE:
Today is the final day of my campaign!
I am really quite close to my initial goal — as of 7am, I am at $2,944, out of the $3,500 wished for!
I would really love to get the funds to $3,000. I think, if I am very careful, I could almost completely cover the cost of the trip with $3,000.
So, I’ve come up with one more perk to perhaps entice you on this last leg of the campaign! ANY contribution (over $1) made today will receive a nice, thickly-printed bookmark, designed by Sebastian (an extremely talented visual artist) and I, with my favorite poem (can you guess what it might be?) inscribed on the back.
Already made a donation, but might like to contribute a few dollars more? No problem — the bookmark will be sent in addition to whatever perk you might have already selected!
Maybe you would like to make a larger contribution to match on of the bigger perks? The bookmark will, again, be an additional gift!
I am completely and absolutely heart-filled with the incredible support I have received from friends and “strangers” alike. I started the project driven by my own desire to tell this story. Now it is so much more than that.
And, you can keep up with the progress of my research trip (and the growth of the book!) on my blog, lady i swear by all flowers (www.chelseab.typepad.com) — or, email me (chelseaslaven {at} gmail {dot} com) with questions!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
We are two student girls from Belgrade, Serbia.
<ul>
<li>Dragana Kostica  aka Christine C. A blogger, couchsurfer, social activist, member of AESOP NGO, student of archaeology and huge music and arts fan. Her blog: <a href=""http://www.exploringbelgrade.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.exploringbelgrade.wordpress.com</a>
</li>
<li>Jovana Bogicevic  aka Johana B. Student of art and member of Banda Panda art collective. Article about Banda Panda:  <a href=""http://exploringbelgrade.wordpress.com/2012/02/14/omg-they-are-so-contemporary-the-art-collective-banda-panda"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://exploringbelgrade.wordpress.com/2012/02/14/omg-they-are-so-contemporary-the-art-collective-banda-panda</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea for this project originated from a non-profitable blog Exploring Belgrade that covered events in the city, which reached unexpected popularity and followers from all around the globe. Still in Belgrade will be a sort of an upgrade from this blog that will offer wider array of topics and opportunities for still not established authors.</p>
<div>
<div>The idea is to make a practical and useful website which will offer fresh updates on all major cultural events in the city.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need 1000$ to launch a website with a sophisticated design.</p>
<p>It is only with your help that we can make this project happen. Both of us are still students, and on our own it would be impossible to collect such funds.</p>
<p>Belgrade is a city with long history, and with an ever improving cultural scene, however it lacks a high quality on-line city guide with carefully selected and useful information. It is our goal to make such a guide and help foreigners as well as locals in making the most of it.</p>
<p>There are many very creative people who don’t get a chance to promote their ideas, and our web site will give them an opportunity to do so!</p>
<div>Belgrade is becoming a major cultural destination of the region, and of Europe, and we strongly believe it deserves all of our help.</div>
<p>By donating, you are supporting creativity and art. We hope you will use the information we provide prior to your visit to Belgrade.</p>
<p>See the list and descriptions of perks below.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>Still in Belgrade is a project conceived as an open, flexible interactive platform in which various authors from different countries will participate.</div>
<div>The idea is to create a website that combines a virtual city guide, an on-line magazine and a blog. </div>
<div>The primary focus will be on the cultural scene of Belgrade, however more global topics will include global culture, society, music, arts, design, club culture, travel and lifestyle.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Articles will be written in English and Serbian</div>
<div>
<div>Website will present the fallowing categories:</div>
<ul>
<li>Belgrade city guide</li>
<li>Local events</li>
<li>Culture &amp; Society</li>
<li>Music &amp; Club Culture</li>
<li>Arts &amp; Design </li>
<li>Travel &amp; Lifestyle</li>

<h3>PRESENTING PART ONE OF THE CITY SERIES: CUBISM IS SO SUPERANNUATED!</h3>
<p><em>Cubism is so Superannuated</em> is an in-progress novel -- due sometime September 2013 -- all about superheroes, weird tentacles (and other tropes!), and filing the proper Re-Alignment of Loyalty Forms (RALFs) for the next betrayal down the line.  It's mostly a comedy, sort of a romance (if throwing buses full of people can qualify..), and possibly a dig on art history along with all the cliches.  It really depends on how you look at it.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:30px;""><em>George Cuvier is the legendary superhero Iguanodon, his normal alter-ego being the rich lackadaisical man who wears couture because it's proper and lets his butler keep a bear around because it's easier not to argue.  As Iguanodon he is in a constant heroic struggle against the villainous Carnivora, this manipulative evil-doer who seems to steal signatures from everyone and never develops his own schtick.</em><br/><br/><em>But of course, Carnivora's alter-ego is really Étienne Hilaire, Cuvier's best friend from childhood.  And of course, instead of bad-guying it up all the time he tends to spend manic bursts of energy mooning over Cuvier and pestering him for a reaction.</em><br/><br/><em>Cuvier doesn't really care if his arch-enemy isn't dedicated.  He isn't dedicated either.  He'd rather collect collections from other government mandated Supers than tromp out to get another bus thrown at his head.</em><br/><br/><em>Regardless of all this, they're both rather popular.  Little boys adore Iguanodon!  Girls shriek at the name of Carnivora!  So when the Mayor of The City, Paul, is mysteriously in absentia and trouble by way of Alternate Universes, rogue tech from the University, and poor citizens sprouting tentacles from their eye sockets start to happen, the two men have to get involved.  Despite their adamant disinterest.</em><br/><br/><em>Humorously slanted and full of every sci-fi/fantasy trope there is with the intent of playing it straight, this is a story about doing your job, dealing with the repercussions, and possibly developing a concoction that takes care of the tentacles problem.  (WITHOUT driving the hosts of said tentacles mad during, please and thank you.)</em></p>
<h3>OKAY, SO WHO ARE YOU?</h3>
<p>I'm Sinead Malloy, but my nom de plume is Glitzy Babylon because it's easier to remember.. and spell!  I've been writing since I was seven -- something about Edgar Allen Poe and H.P. Lovecraft teaming up to solve crimes, it was really convoluted and incoherent, I am so so sorry Universe -- and have finally gotten around to figuring out how I can get my stories out to the world.</p>
<p>Self publishing via Kindle Direct (&amp; possible other places) is going to be the name of the game, oh boy.  I can write novella-length -- my <em>faaavourite</em>, why is this my favourite? -- and get them to a reading public without wading hip-deep through pudding while shackled to a sun bear.  It's a process, obviously.</p>
<p>I've got a weird living situation -- no electricity!  only solar.. eventually? -- and a desire to write.  And too many dogs, too.  Hold me?</p>
</div><div>
<h3>BUT WHY IS THIS A PROJECT <em>HERE</em>, JIM?</h3>
<p>Unfortunately as things are now, I'm having a hard time writing as much as I'd like, as I <em>need</em> to.  My laptop is dying a horrible, Julius Caesar death -- it's from 2001, I can't blame it for wanting to expire on the steps of the Roman Senate in a dramatic fashion and take all my files with it -- and I need to somehow find funds to hire someone to <em>edit</em> what I write before it gets flaunted all over the world.  (Because all over the world it shall go!) </p>This is where the campaign comes in.  I'm asking for funding to pay a freelance <em>unbiased</em> editor to whack at <em>Superannuated</em> with a chainsaw, keep my hosting bill paid for a few more months so I can try out this weird platform thing people keep telling me I need to get onto, and (hopefully) have enough left over to pay for a pawn shop special laptop.  It's okay if it has viruses.  My mother's got tech friends, I'll beg familial favours for a fix.</div><div> </div><div>The funds priority is as follows:</div><div><ol>
<li>Editing services for the final mss, so the published work is as poslished as possible.</li>
<li>Laptop.  One that doesn't cost more than $200 or so.  And doesn't take 6 hours to open a .pdf file, what the hell that was a freaky occurrence.</li>
<li>Hosting bill.  Not very high up on the list, but it weighs on the mind, so putting it here anyway!</li>
</ol></div><h3>WHAT DO I GET IF I THROW MONEY AT YOU?</h3><div>EVERY SINGLE LAST CONTRIBUTOR WILL GET:</div><ul>
<li>a copy of the novella once it's finished, edited, and swanked up.</li>
<li>a mention in the acknowledgements page in the final product.  INFAMY!  YOU WILL HAVE IT!</li>
</ul><div>
<h3>OKAY, SO.. HOW DO WE KNOW IF YOU CAN <em>WRITE</em>??</h3>Well, I've got the first five thousand words of the novella up on google docs for you to read?  Is that good?</div><div> </div><div><a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p6oA-h6D6skUBhiKi-V2Vgk0N_oFZnzswRdbFyroHkg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p6oA-h6D6skUBhiKi-V2Vgk0N_oFZnzswRdbFyroHkg</a></div><p>Nothing else I can really say here, sorry.</p><h3>YEAH, OKAY, SO. CONCLUSION, ERROL FLYNNS AND FLYNNETTES.</h3><div>My goal for this project is basically on the high end, because I don't know how much it'll cost to pay the editor.  Somewhere around $500 to $700 is what I'm going on right now.  The projected final count is going to be upwards of 60,000 words, but it might require multiple edits.  I don't really know.  But I <em>do</em> know that I need to make it tip-top and worth an absolute stranger's money, so.. Crowdfunding.  Gotta give it a whirl.</div><div> </div><div>If you like the provided opening and want to see more of the story, please consider chucking a few dollars in the tin.  If you'd like to, but haven't the cash, then please tell your friends! </div><div> </div><div> </div><div>My absolute endgame in life is to pay my bills and manage to entertain people at the same time.  The bills are being taken care of at the moment.  Please help me out with the entertainment portion if you can &lt;3</div></div>","PRESENTING PART ONE OF THE CITY SERIES: CUBISM IS SO SUPERANNUATED!

HOW DO WE KNOW IF YOU CAN WRITE??Well, I've got the first five thousand words of the novella up on google docs for you to read?  Is that good? https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p6oA-h6D6skUBhiKi-V2Vgk0N_oFZnzswRdbFyroHkgNothing else I can really say here, sorry.YEAH, OKAY, SO. CONCLUSION, ERROL FLYNNS AND FLYNNETTES.My goal for this project is basically on the high end, because I don't know how much it'll cost to pay the editor.  Somewhere around $500 to $700 is what I'm going on right now.  The projected final count is going to be upwards of 60,000 words, but it might require multiple edits.  I don't really know.  But I do know that I need to make it tip-top and worth an absolute stranger's money, so.. Crowdfunding.  Gotta give it a whirl. If you like the provided opening and want to see more of the story, please consider chucking a few dollars in the tin.  If you'd like to, but haven't the cash, then please tell your friends!   My absolute endgame in life is to pay my bills and manage to entertain people at the same time.  The bills are being taken care of at the moment.  Please help me out with the entertainment portion if you can <3",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Who am I? I am a mother of five, a grandmother of 13, a full-time hospice nurse, and an independent woman. My younger years were spent raising my children, most often alone. At 40, I obtained my RN license. At 58, I completed my bachelor's degree. As a mother, my purpose and passion was always my children. As a single mom, it was challenging, to say the least. They are all independent with their own lives. I am taking this opportunity to pursue my dreams. My biggest dream for a long time is to write my first children's book. The ideas have been in my head for a long time. </p>
<p>The purpose of my campaign is to raise the funds I need to write, obtain the illustrations and publish my first children's book. I have hired an illustrator to complete the illustrations for my book. This campaign is to help me pay for the illustration alone. I will be pursing a publisher while the book is being put together and I am not sure what costs I will ensue at that time. But, first things first.....I must have a book.   </p>
<p>If you choose to contribute to my campaign, you will help me to achieve my hopes and dreams of becoming a bonafide, published author. You will be supporting a strong and independent woman who believes in female entrepreneurs. You will support the reality that we can overcome any obstacle set before us, by believing that anything is possible and that one must never give up on making their dreams come true. </p>
<p>Reading to children when they are young is important because it promotes a love for books and reading at an early age. It is educational and provides a bonding time with parents and loved ones.  My goal is to make my books fun and easy to read for parents and children alike. My illustrator has captured the vision I had in my head for so long. My hope is that the illustrations and story will make the parent and the child laugh! </p>
<p>Being my first book, it does not speak to my success as an author. I believe my efforts and success as a mother, obtaining my education with five children at home, earning my bachelor's degree at the age of 58,  my dedication to my profession, and overcoming much adversity and opposition, illustrates my determination and ability to succeed with my book. I hope you will have faith in my ability to succeed. </p>
<p>To make this dream come to life, I need my illustrator will do her magic for about 18 pages of illustrations. Her fee is $130 per page. That illustration cost creates a challenge for me financially, but I believe in myself and my talent. I just cannot complete it without support. </p>
<p>It is my fervent hope that you will consider a contribution to my book's creation and success. If you would please share this site with people you know, who might have an interest in new authors, and in promoting entrepreneurs and women. There are ""share tools"" on my site that can help you spread the word! I would appreciate any interest in my endeavor and any contributions,</p>

<h3>Not
Your ""Normal"" Grief Book </h3>
<p>
Ever
since I can remember, I always pictured myself as writing a book one
day. I used to fall asleep to dreams of being on David Letterman's
show, bantering and joking with him and making him laugh, while
plugging my latest novel about life and comedy and whatever else I
was planning on writing about. </p>
<p>
Never
in a million years did I ever think I'd be writing a book about
loving, marrying, and then losing my beautiful husband. But life's a
funny thing, and now here we are, and that is what I'm writing. </p>
<p>
The
idea for this book began out of the very real desperation of me
reaching out in the days and weeks after my world collapsed - just
searching like mad to connect with someone, anyone - who would answer
me back. I began posting every emotion and feeling about the death
and the loss on my Facebook page. Eventually, that turned into me
writing everything down in my blog (<a href=""http://www.ripthelifeiknew.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.ripthelifeiknew.com</a>), which
at some point, morphed into turning all of it into this book. </p>
<p>
This
book is not like any other grief-related book that is
currently out there. Aside from being brutally honest and painfully funny, the book is unique because it is written in several
different forms: poetry, blog pieces, the original Facebook posts
taken from my page, actual dialogue snippets from my grief-counseling
sessions, quotes and thoughts from other widowed people I have met,
love letters that tell the story of the man who changed me forever,
and much more. Because the book covers everything , in real-time,
from the day he died until three years later - the reader is able to
witness first-hand, the ever-changing and fascinating world that is
grief. With each turn of the page, time moves forward, so the reader
watches as the tone, writing style, and topics all begin to slowly
change, as I slowly change. Trust me, you have never read anything
quite like this before. I should know, because I have never written
anything like this before - until, of course, I did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
<b>Where's
My Money Going, Bitch?</b></p>
<p>Well,
there's really no need to be cursing at me, as I am more than happy
to answer this very important question.  All the monies from
your generous donations will be used to cover the many different and
varied costs associated with the self-publishing of my book. These
costs include things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Copy
	and  Content Editing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Printing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shipping</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cover
	Design and Cover Art</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Internal
	Design and Layout</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Marketing
	and Publicity </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Traveling,
	Speaking Engagements, and Events to Help Promote the Book</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Book-release
	/ launch party in NYC, tentatively scheduled for November</p>
</li>
<li><p>Additional costs
	associated with self-publishing such as editing programs, software, website revisions, etc. </p></li>
</ul><p><b>Why am I asking?</b></p><p>My husband's death was sudden and completely unexpected. He was a paramedic, and I was a part-time professor, teaching Acting and Comedy Courses at Adelphi University<br/></p><p>We
were only 4 years into our marriage, and so we did not own a house
yet, or have a chance to start our family that we dreamed of.
Therefore, I was left with nothing. There was no life insurance, no
savings, and I lost my health insurance because I was covered under
his. Although we were extremely happy, we lived paycheck to paycheck
and struggled financially. His death led to me struggling even more,
and I was forced to move out of our apartment, sell his car, and get
a roommate. Twice. In the past 2.5 years since his death, I have been
known to work 2 and sometimes 3 jobs at once, just to stay afloat. </p>
<p>I do not have the funds to be able to publish this on my own. So the only way that I can make this a reality is with the help of others… of you. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
<b>Got
No Cash? You Can Still Help! </b></p>
<p>
Believe
me, if there is anyone who knows what it is like to be broke, it is
me. Trust me on that. So, if you truly cannot afford to help
financially, you can still help by making yourself heard. Spread the
word about this campaign to anyone and everyone you know. If you are
part of a large family or big group email list, share it with all of
them! Tell all of your friends to share this. If you don't have any
friends, I'm sorry about that. You should really go out and get some.
Hey - you know a great way to get friends? Buy them stuff. Like an
autographed copy of my book, for example. A simple donation of $45
will get you that, and then you will have a new friend. See, I told
you this book is going to help people. </p>
<h4>They
Like Me! They Really Like Me! </h4>
<p>
You
do not have to be widowed in order to benefit from this book. In
truth, this book is being written for everybody. If you have ever
been in love or wanted to be in love, or wished to be in love - then
you should read this book. If you have ever suffered from PTSD,
anxiety, or been through a trauma of any kind - you should read this
book. If you have lost anything in your life, or been through
hardships, and felt completely alone and like nobody could ever

""Kelley,
I want you to know what you have done for me. It's a gift you
probably haven't considered, but reading your blog has made me
straighten up and zip my lip whenever my husband does something.
Can't put his dish in the dishwasher? Could be worse. He could be
gone. Your strength is inspiring, but your insight is mindblowing.
Thank you."" - Karen B.</p>
<p>
""You
paint such beautiful and vivid pictures of your love through your
words. I feel like Im watching a movie whenever I read them. You
probably have no idea how much your words have helped others. You
have taught me to live each day, for we have no idea what tomorrow
will bring. Sometimes when I get discouraged, I remember your words
and I find it so much easier to see the humor in the difficult days.
You have reminded me how blessed my family is to still have our dad
here with us, and to be able to hug him.  Bless you, Kelley.
Keep writing, and keep sharing with the world, your story."" -

like a hermit in our apartment, letting the darkness overtake me.  I

found you. The first thing I clicked on was a post called ""I

almost scared myself. I had forgotten that I knew how to laugh, and

found myself in the fetal position, sobbing my face off for an hour,

months, I hadnt let out my emotions. Im not sure why, but I think its
because I was ashamed. Reading your words gave me the push and

Frank S.</p><p></p></div>","Not
Your ""Normal"" Grief Book 

Ever
since I can remember, I always pictured myself as writing a book one
day. I used to fall asleep to dreams of being on David Letterman's
show, bantering and joking with him and making him laugh, while
plugging my latest novel about life and comedy and whatever else I
was planning on writing about. 

Never
in a million years did I ever think I'd be writing a book about
loving, marrying, and then losing my beautiful husband. But life's a
funny thing, and now here we are, and that is what I'm writing. 

The
idea for this book began out of the very real desperation of me
reaching out in the days and weeks after my world collapsed - just
searching like mad to connect with someone, anyone - who would answer
me back. I began posting every emotion and feeling about the death
and the loss on my Facebook page. Eventually, that turned into me
writing everything down in my blog (www.ripthelifeiknew.com), which
at some point, morphed into turning all of it into this book. 

This
book is not like any other grief-related book that is
currently out there. Aside from being brutally honest and painfully funny, the book is unique because it is written in several
different forms: poetry, blog pieces, the original Facebook posts
taken from my page, actual dialogue snippets from my grief-counseling
sessions, quotes and thoughts from other widowed people I have met,
love letters that tell the story of the man who changed me forever,
and much more. Because the book covers everything , in real-time,
from the day he died until three years later - the reader is able to
witness first-hand, the ever-changing and fascinating world that is
grief. With each turn of the page, time moves forward, so the reader
watches as the tone, writing style, and topics all begin to slowly
change, as I slowly change. Trust me, you have never read anything
quite like this before. I should know, because I have never written
anything like this before - until, of course, I did.



Where's
My Money Going, Bitch?
Well,
there's really no need to be cursing at me, as I am more than happy
to answer this very important question.  All the monies from
your generous donations will be used to cover the many different and
varied costs associated with the self-publishing of my book. These
costs include things like:


Copy
	and  Content Editing


Printing


Shipping


Cover
	Design and Cover Art


Internal
	Design and Layout


Marketing
	and Publicity 


Traveling,
	Speaking Engagements, and Events to Help Promote the Book


Book-release
	/ launch party in NYC, tentatively scheduled for November

Additional costs
	associated with self-publishing such as editing programs, software, website revisions, etc. 
Why am I asking?My husband's death was sudden and completely unexpected. He was a paramedic, and I was a part-time professor, teaching Acting and Comedy Courses at Adelphi UniversityWe
were only 4 years into our marriage, and so we did not own a house
yet, or have a chance to start our family that we dreamed of.
Therefore, I was left with nothing. There was no life insurance, no
savings, and I lost my health insurance because I was covered under
his. Although we were extremely happy, we lived paycheck to paycheck
and struggled financially. His death led to me struggling even more,
and I was forced to move out of our apartment, sell his car, and get
a roommate. Twice. In the past 2.5 years since his death, I have been
known to work 2 and sometimes 3 jobs at once, just to stay afloat. 
I do not have the funds to be able to publish this on my own. So the only way that I can make this a reality is with the help of others… of you. 



Got
No Cash? You Can Still Help! 

Believe
me, if there is anyone who knows what it is like to be broke, it is
me. Trust me on that. So, if you truly cannot afford to help
financially, you can still help by making yourself heard. Spread the
word about this campaign to anyone and everyone you know. If you are
part of a large family or big group email list, share it with all of
them! Tell all of your friends to share this. If you don't have any
friends, I'm sorry about that. You should really go out and get some.
Hey - you know a great way to get friends? Buy them stuff. Like an
autographed copy of my book, for example. A simple donation of $45
will get you that, and then you will have a new friend. See, I told
you this book is going to help people. 
They
Like Me! They Really Like Me! 

You
do not have to be widowed in order to benefit from this book. In
truth, this book is being written for everybody. If you have ever
been in love or wanted to be in love, or wished to be in love - then
you should read this book. If you have ever suffered from PTSD,
anxiety, or been through a trauma of any kind - you should read this
book. If you have lost anything in your life, or been through
hardships, and felt completely alone and like nobody could ever
understand you - then this book is for you. If you know someone who
is grieving the loss of the person that they loved most in this
world, and you have no idea how to help them or how to be their
friend - then you should read this book, or give it to them as a gift
from you, when you don't know what to say. I know what to say. I have
been where they are. I am there now. I am still crawling through it.
This book is for anyone and everyone that has ever felt hurt or pain
or loss; anyone who is human and has a beating heart. 

Here
are a few words from a few of my readers. Reading their thoughts puts
in concrete what I already knew - that this book will change lives,
and make people feel less alone :

""Kelley,

<h3>The Short Version</h3>
<p>Create a service to support pro-indy groups and
help them with fundraising, merchandise, design, web hosting, and
administration. 
</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>One of the strengths of the Yes campaign was its
creative diversity. Hundreds of groups and thousands of individuals
stood up to carry forward the arguments for independence. It was a
mad, frenetic, vibrant, inclusive campaign crackling with positive
energy, like somebody had tipped the Fringe Festival into a national
political debate. And although we lost that vote, we're all proud of
the part we played in it, because it was an almost magical political
awakening for Scotland.<br/><br/>But one of the flaws of the campaign
was that these fantastic people were largely unsupported and had to learn on the run. They all had to plan and strategise for
meetings, demos, performances... but before they could do ANYTHING
they needed <i>money</i>. So everybody went on a fundraising learning
curve.<br/><br/>Then they needed 30 hours a day just to do <i>half </i>of
what they'd agreed to, and find time to package and label hundreds of
products - like some nightmarish version of last minute Christmas
shopping - and... <i>my God, is that how much postage costs these
days? </i><br/><br/>All of these wonderful, hard-working campaigners
went through the same journey. Many are still on that path, as folks
like <b>Wings, Bella, Newsnet, Wee Ginger Dug, WFI, Common Space </b>and
many, many more continue to do the job that the media has utterly
failed to.</p>
<h3>The Pitch</h3>
<p>We've been taking care of <b>Wings Over Scotland's
</b>fulfilment for the last three years, including distributing the
<b>Wee Blue Book</b>. When we first approached Stu our idea was quite
simple; let us take care of the admin stuff, and you can concentrate
on writing. And that's the idea behind ayeMail – we want to offer
everybody these services. It's a support system for pro-indy groups;
it's what Yes Scotland should have been, and what we need before a
second referendum.<br/><br/>We'll send out letters, posters, perks,
merchandise, books – you name it, we'll deliver. We'll hold  stock
so that campaigners are no longer tripping over boxes of product in
hallways, bedrooms or garages. We'll free up their time to do what <i>we
</i>all love them doing; campaigning for indy.<br/><br/>But it's not
just a gift wrapping service, we can do so much more. We can
<b>manufacture </b>many of the items needed at a fraction of the cost
of commercial suppliers; badges, keyrings, magnets, donor
certificates and much more. We can build websites; create posters,
banners and flyers; shoot and edit video; even publish books. <br/><br/>We've
got the skills, experience and technology to do all this, and by
co-ordinating across multiple pro-indy groups and individuals, we can
bring economies of scale to everyone.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What we need is time, <i>full-time </i>in fact. A
small part of the ask is towards equipment, but the majority of it is
to enable us to work full-time supporting not just Wings, but <b>all
</b>groups who campaign for independence. The sums are quite modest.
We don't need a lot, just enough to keep the lights on and the
computers running - but to us it would make a <i>huge </i>difference,
and enable us to support the work of hundreds of others.<br/><br/>So
first of all we're asking for <b>£2,000 </b>to fund two people to
work (mostly to volunteer, in fact) over an initial five month period (and if we have enough work after that, we'll keep going).
I know that's a heck of an ask in these cash-strapped times, but it's
only £200 a month apiece. That's enough to keep the bank manager off
our backs for the moment, so that's all that we humbly ask
for.<br/><br/>Secondly, we need some equipment;</p>

However, like a soldier returning from battle tested, I’ve never had such faith in my worthiness and readiness to make this contribution to the world.You have my gratitude for taking the time to read this; your help in the completion of this journey, and faith in me, will not be forgotten.Sam SpicherSamspicher@gmail.com",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Lovecraft For Six Year Olds</h3> <p></p>
<p>Mythos ABC
is an alphabet book where you at last get rid of Zebras and Xmas since Lovecraft liked to use the entire range of letters. But most of all, it's a tribute to his
mythos put into nursery rhymes. Imagine it as a way of exploring Lovecraft’s
world of ancient gods, monsters and otherworldly geometry with a six year old
in hand. That way the mythos may still be occasionally scary, but it’ll also
be funny, strange and wonderful.  </p>
<p>And it <i>is </i>going to be a wonderful book, with 26
beautiful illustrations made by talented artists who love the Cthulhu mythos as
much as I do - you can see some of the illustrations right here on this page. And very importantly - this is not going to be some small book that's easily lost. We’re
going to a produce a huge A4 wide-format book that really shows off the artwork and gives
the kids something to look at. After all, you don’t want to hide your mythos,
do you?<br/></p>

<h3>Hvad er Mythos ABC?</h3>

Hans univers kaldes for The Cthulhu Mythos, og bogen er et forsøg på at introducere børn til noget lidt uhyggeligt, men også sjovt, sært og fantastisk.

<p>I quit my day job to invest in my career as a novelist.</p>
<p>Now, in 2013, I have written a novel in a new genre. I have created a world in which African vampires have come to America during the transatlantic slave trade and have been imbedded in the New World since colonial days.</p>
<p>I'm no stranger to writing.  While an undergrad at Georgetown, I wrote my first play and participated in poetry readings on and off-campus.  Over the next several years, I wrote and independently published three novels and a book of poetry:  <em>Lazarus</em>, <em>Covenant</em>, <em>Epiphany</em>, and <em>The Life and Death of Savion Cortez</em>.  Each of my books averages no less than 4.8 of five stars on Amazon!  You can find out more about my career so far at <a href=""http://www.oldgoldsoul.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.oldgoldsoul.com</a> and <a href=""http://www.rashiddarden.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.rashiddarden.com</a>. </p>
<p>I want to add to the growing canon of vampire stories a legend that reflects the traditions and values of the African diaspora.  Although we all grew up with many wonderful, well-written, and successful vampire stories, it's high time that everyone gets a great story from a different cultural perspective.  </p>
<p>Your investment will help me publish and raise awareness of this novel.  It will also help me to inspire the next generation of novelists.</p>

<p>My goal is significant, but realistic: <strong>$3890</strong></p>
<p><strong>$220</strong> for the cover designer, Charlis Foster, who has provided an extraordinary discount for services which could easily be over four figures.</p>
<p><strong>$413</strong> for greatly reduced copyediting and editorial development fees.</p>
<p><strong>$220</strong> for printing and postage of promotional postcards.</p>
<p><strong>$606</strong> for printing of review copies.</p>
<p><strong>$616</strong> for shipping costs of review copies.</p>
<p><strong>$1815</strong> for travel and lodging for free writing workshops at 20 colleges and universities.</p>

<p>I write books to change the world.  This is how your investment in my career accomplishes that.</p>
<p>I have chosen 20 colleges and universities in several states that will receive a free writing workshop if this project is fully funded.  I have chosen universities that do not have large endowments and are not necessarily able to provide the same level of programming that other schools may be able to.  If I am able to reach 50 students at each school, then I will have inspired 1000 emerging writers to pursue careers as poets, novelists, essayists, and other noble paths in the writing professions.  I believe that I can reach many more than 1000 with cooperation from the schools themselves.</p>

I quit my day job to invest in my career as a novelist.
Now, in 2013, I have written a novel in a new genre. I have created a world in which African vampires have come to America during the transatlantic slave trade and have been imbedded in the New World since colonial days.
I'm no stranger to writing.  While an undergrad at Georgetown, I wrote my first play and participated in poetry readings on and off-campus.  Over the next several years, I wrote and independently published three novels and a book of poetry:  Lazarus, Covenant, Epiphany, and The Life and Death of Savion Cortez.  Each of my books averages no less than 4.8 of five stars on Amazon!  You can find out more about my career so far at www.oldgoldsoul.com and www.rashiddarden.com. 
I want to add to the growing canon of vampire stories a legend that reflects the traditions and values of the African diaspora.  Although we all grew up with many wonderful, well-written, and successful vampire stories, it's high time that everyone gets a great story from a different cultural perspective.  
Your investment will help me publish and raise awareness of this novel.  It will also help me to inspire the next generation of novelists.
 

My goal is significant, but realistic: $3890
$220 for the cover designer, Charlis Foster, who has provided an extraordinary discount for services which could easily be over four figures.
$413 for greatly reduced copyediting and editorial development fees.
$220 for printing and postage of promotional postcards.
$606 for printing of review copies.
$616 for shipping costs of review copies.
$1815 for travel and lodging for free writing workshops at 20 colleges and universities.

In the event that I raise an additional $2,110 beyond my goal, I will use the extra funding to hire a public relations assistant and add even more schools to the writing workshp tour! 
 

There are many fun perks for investing in the Black Vampire Project, including thank yous on my website, acknowledgements in the novel, an e-book, signed copies of Birth of a Dark Nation, Lazarus, Covenant, and Epiphany, a poster version of the cover, a Skype conversation with me, and even getting a character in the novel named after you!
 
 


I write books to change the world.  This is how your investment in my career accomplishes that.
I have chosen 20 colleges and universities in several states that will receive a free writing workshop if this project is fully funded.  I have chosen universities that do not have large endowments and are not necessarily able to provide the same level of programming that other schools may be able to.  If I am able to reach 50 students at each school, then I will have inspired 1000 emerging writers to pursue careers as poets, novelists, essayists, and other noble paths in the writing professions.  I believe that I can reach many more than 1000 with cooperation from the schools themselves.
 
 

I have conducted workshops and lectures at colleges and universities since 2005, including Georgetown, Howard, Ohio, Cal State LA, and the University of Maryland; for the National Multicultural Greek Council; and for the Deltas, AKAs, Lambda Psi Delta, Alpha Phi Omega, and the Links.
I am also committed to writing as a full-time job.  Your investment helps me get the right start on that career.  Prior to now, writing was always secondary to having a ""regular job.""  Now that I am making my dreams and my vocation one in the same, I could use help bridging the gap between my goals and my reality.  I can do this because I have the tenacity, endurance, and creatvity.

<h3>¿Qué?</h3>
<p><strong>Querido enemigo</strong> puede parecer una apuesta arriesgada, pero quizá va siendo hora de que las historias empiecen a cambiar.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:80px;""><strong>odio</strong><i> sust. masc. </i>1. Sentimiento profundo e intenso de repulsa hacia alguien que provoca el deseo de producirle un daño o de que le ocurra alguna desgracia.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Clara y Dante quieren empezar de cero. Ella carga con un presente que se hace cada vez más pesado, y él arrastra un pasado que amenaza con alcanzarlo a cada paso que da. Son dos polos opuestos que se encuentran en el escenario idóneo para iniciar un romance épico de esos sobre los que se escriben las canciones, pero por desgracia el amor no es algo de lo que sepan nada, así que su historia toma un rumbo totalmente distinto.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">En su escalada para salir del agujero en el que se encuentran, tanto Clara como Dante aprenderán, no sin ayuda, que la salvación se encuentra en los lugares (y en las personas) más inesperados.</p>
<h3>¿Quiénes?</h3>
<p><strong>Tandaia </strong>es una editorial con voluntad de cambio, de dar la alternativa a autores que no la encuentran en otro lugar, con nuevas y refrescantes ideas como es el emplear una campaña preventa para valorar la aceptación y viabilidad de cada título.</p>

<h3>Major Update</h3>
<p><strong>Several new developments have caused me to drastically change the focus of this campaign. I'm getting some significant press coverage for the website, and things are actually going quite well, with some money coming from an outside source.</strong></p>
<p><strong>But I've recantly launched a prgram to provide inexpensice eBook Readers to kids who can't afford them. eBooks are without doubt the wave of the future, and it won't be long before they're even being assigned in classrooms. Kids who can't access them will be like the kids who didn't have TV when I was young, and couldn't watch an assigned TV Special about history, or the Apollo Moon Landings. Those kids were alughed at, ostracized, because of their lack.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This program will provide e-Readers to such kids. The device I've found is simple. It has WiFi capability, can browse the web, and can display eBooks and play music or audiobooks. In volume purchases, my cost is around $20 each. </strong></p>
<p><strong>I can't change the whole campaign here, so I'm using this spot. Since I no longer need funding for the company itself, I'm asking you to contribute to this program. However much comes in will help.</strong></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm a guy who's come to understand just what it means to have a dream and not know how to make it a reality. I'd wanted to write novels all my life, but working kept me from it for years. When an accident put me in a wheelchair, I suddenly had nothing but time, and so I started writing.</p>
<p>But having written several novels, I soon found that the real work was only beginning. You can't sell a book if no one ever hears of it, and so I spent months doing nothing but promoting my work.</p>
<p>Now I've developed some ideas that work, and I want to share them with other writers. I've built an online publishing platform that is far better than most of the choices new writers face, and now I'm trying to expand it into something that will make a real difference for everyone who's trying to live that same dream!</p>
<p>And if you're not familair with eBooks, then check this out: I'm giving away one of my own novels, <em>Magic Trixie and the Crystal Witch</em>, for free, right now on the website. This is a book that has already delighted readers from 8 to 80! Feel free to download it and check it out, and see what the buzz is all about!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What I'm seeking is up to $35,000.00. With that money, I can hire the staff I need to take this to the nest level, and I can build a marketing campaign that will get it out in front of every new Author and millions of Readers.</p>
<p>The goal I've set may seem high, but it's not impossible to reach. I've seen many Campaigns here on Indiegogo raise far more. However, it isn't entirely necessary for me to raise it all right here and now. Every dime that does come in will help, as it will let me promote the benefits we can offer to more and more writers. And as the company becomes better known, it's quite likely that I'll find the investors who can see its amazing potential, and help me take it the rest of the way to the top!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This company will make it possible for many, many Authors to actually get their books published, and connect with Readers who will enjoy them. With all of the special services we offer, eBookOnFire.com can help a good writer become a Great Writer!</p>
<p>That means that every contribution, large or small, is going not only to help me expand this company, but to improving the lives of countless new writers who need the services we offer, and even more readers, who long for a good book! Help us make both of those dreams come true.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

Use the Shairng Buttons on this website to let others know about this campaign. Tell yur friends, especially if you know someone who is a writer!

Australia. About a year ago Daya, the author and my niece, sent us an email
stating ""That's it! I just finished writing my first novel -
Murderess"". After reading the 240 pages of Murderess and learning that
this is only the first of six books in ""The Exiles of Greywall'd
Saga"", we (my family and I) decided that this amazing fantasy cannot
remain unknown. </p><p>Together, with Daya and our family we started the long and
exciting journey of self-publishing a book. Murderess, will be published in two
languages. Hebrew, the language it was written in and of course, in English.
Today, we are at the final stage of making Daya's new world - Greywall'd, a
reality for all ages to read and enjoy.</p>
<p>We are inviting you to join our journey, support us and
become active members of our new community. Your support will help us overcome
the expensive secret of publishing a book in two languages.</p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/369377/files/20140213214322-Cover_9-1-1_Eng.jpg?1392356602"" src="""" style=""width: 134.4390243902439px; height: 208px;""/>             <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/369378/files/20140213214408-Cover_11-2_Heb.jpg?1392356648"" src="""" style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em; width: 135px; height: 209px;""/></p><p></p><p>Please feel free to download and
