By 1972 I was living in Laurel Canyon and performing on television and radio, at concerts all over LA, and opening for artists like the Doobie Brothers, Peter Gallway, and Leon Russell. In 1978 I went to England where I continued performing and in 1981 I got the attention of Paul McCartney, who gave me some serious consideration. I thought I'd finally get to make an album!

<p>If you're reading this, we probably know each other, so I'll skip my introduction and tell you about Strahan &amp; The Good Neighbors. To put it simply, we are an American Band or if you're into the whole sub-genre thing, then call it American Old School. It's funky but it isn't funk; there's country, soul, and blues in there, but it isn't any of these; it's American, but it's not Americana. Like my favorite bands from the 60s and 70s, we're steeped in old school American music, but we've evolved into something all it's own. I love this band and our new record, and I want to get both out to you. </p>

<p>Behind the curtains, getting a record out to the masses is a pricey endeavor. It takes many professionals connected in the industry's network of publications and radio stations to move, shake and hustle for any of these said entities to give your work just one listen, let alone consideration for review or airplay. The objective of this campaign is to pay for Public Relations (PR), Promotion, and Radio Placement. It's effectively a non-negotiable investment one has to make in order to be a successful touring band, and to get this music out to you.</p>
<p>Why is it important? Getting our record on the radio, into magazines, online blogs and such, lets people choose for themselves the music that plays on the airwaves, and the bands that play the nearby music venues. Movements of late in music, such as Sturgill Simpson's successful grassroots promotional campaigns, have proven this to be true. We all want to listen to good music! The Good Neighbors and I put in hours, days, weeks (months) on our new album. We're constantly tightening up our set, honing in our individual and collective crafts. We put on a good show and we have a solid record that deserves a chance to be heard.</p>

All that said, if the record is given a chance and we are given the opportunity to perform live, I can assure you, the audience WILL see a show they won't soon forget. We go all in!   SUPPORTING YOUR GOOD NEIGHBORS: Times are tough, and I don't want this to feel like we're asking for a hand out. If financial contributions aren't a possibility, then your simple support is enough. I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO BREAK THE BANK! Give what you can, if you can, and if you can't contribute, it's all good. Help us spread the word on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Email, Snail Mail, come to shows, invite your friends, and give us a listen.   And that's all there is to it.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

Somos un grupo de jóvenes que queremos marcar el genero de la salsa con un sonido nuevo y distinto, lleno de un mensaje de justicia y perseverancia para todos en general.

<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Actualmente, la cantidad de dinero necesaria para financiar un proyecto como este ha bajado en los últimos años en nuestro país dado a los efectos de la última recesión global y problemas económicos que tenemos a nivel local. Sin embargo, esa cantidad sigue siendo considerable para músicos que empezamos con poco pero queremos ofrecer mucho.  Para que tengan una idea, el grabar un solo tema musical puede salir entre $800 y $1,000, tomando en consideración que esto incluye un trabajo bien hecho por parte de los ingenieros de sonido y que una sesión de grabación en el estudio donde grabaríamos, de no hacerse en un día, cuesta aproximadamente $30 por hora y  esta suele tardar más de lo que muchos pueden imaginar. Nosotros tenemos una meta de llegar a una cantidad de $3,500 dado a que la grabación de cada tema nos puede costar unos $900. El resto del dinero se necesitaría para poder contratar al arreglista de la música a ser grabada y para darle una remuneración a los músicos que participarían de nuestra grabación. Ninguna cantidad del dinero a recaudarse en esta campaña se usará para correr con gastos que no tengan que ver con este proyecto.

The rest of the money would be used to pay for musical arrangements and the work our musicians would be doing.

<b>WHO IS ""The Inside Job""?</b><br/><div>
<p></p>
<p>We are three individuals [scroll down for pictures] from South Africa in a small region called the ""Boland"" which is about 60km from the very well known city of Cape Town. <b>We started playing together in May 2009</b> and did our first gig together in June in a venue (now closed down) called ""Corner Bar"". Individually we have very different taste in music. It is a dream making music with 3 different viewpoints and hearing the outcome. <br/><b><i><br/>To be in a country where rock 'n roll is seen as ""white"" music only, is already a barrier not easily broken down and because of this it is difficult getting in the right venues, events &amp; festivals. <br/><br/>What we want, is for you to hear our passion, everyone around the world.</i></b></p>

<p><b>MIX &amp; MASTER - R60 000</b></p>
<p>We are busy with a 12 track album, which means to <u>mix and master</u> each song will cost at most R5 000/song (Mixing R3900 + Mastering R1100). A mixing engineer makes everything sound great together, making sure the guitar isn't too loud and the voice fits in the mix. Makes the bass not blow your car speaker. The mastering engineer is the polisher. Once the mixing engineer is done, he hands it over to this 'master'. The volume is also greatly increased without distorting the track.</p>
<p><b>PACKAGING - R5000</b></p>
<p>For the printing of the covers, cd casing, compact discs, writing of cd's and wrapping of 400 cd's will be around R5000.</p>
<p><b>DISTRIBUTION - R10 000</b></p>
<p>This is the most important part for us, to be heard. For us to get our music heard on radio stations, cd's in shops and on <i>Itunes</i> it'll cost minumum R10 000. The reason why we say mimimum is because, we can not distribute enough. It's an on going procedure, but with the sales of our 400 albums, merchandise, etc we can keep it going. </p>
<p>It all comes down to an amount of R 75, 000 / $ 5, 750<br/><br/>                     _____________________________</p>

WHO IS ""The Inside Job""?

We are three individuals [scroll down for pictures] from South Africa in a small region called the ""Boland"" which is about 60km from the very well known city of Cape Town. We started playing together in May 2009 and did our first gig together in June in a venue (now closed down) called ""Corner Bar"". Individually we have very different taste in music. It is a dream making music with 3 different viewpoints and hearing the outcome. To be in a country where rock 'n roll is seen as ""white"" music only, is already a barrier not easily broken down and because of this it is difficult getting in the right venues, events & festivals. What we want, is for you to hear our passion, everyone around the world.
          Our dream is to be able to finish a full album and for it to be heard. 
                     
                      On the guitar and vocals is Lionel John (LJ) Maharajah.




                                                       On drums is Lionel's sister Melony (Phoenixx) Maharajah.



                                   
                                             On the bass is Shawn Adams.

WHY FUNDRAISING? 

 Since we started our journey together almost 6 years ago, we have always tried to do things on our own with the income we generated through shows or individually.

We have realised that we can not do what we have to do on our own, regarding recording a full studio album.

LJ will also be able to edit the mixes at his home studio. We have already shot the first music video of our album in faith that we will finish it.                                Here is a video of us on our way to the shoot...

          

Watch our first music video 'Out Of This World' below...

WHAT DO WE NEED?We need to mix, master, package and distribution. We could buy cheap covers and print the covers with an office printer (haha), but we would love to have a high quality recording, mixed, mastered and packaged so that it reflects what is on the disc as well. Below we have made a detailed description of what the costs are...



                   

                      ______________________________
“The Inside Job always leaves me thinking: “Why the hell aren’t they bigger on the local scene?” They are Main Stage quality and organisers should start realising that.” Dee Theart - Radio Sonder Grense (RSG Radio) ____________________________________________






MIX & MASTER - R60 000
We are busy with a 12 track album, which means to mix and master each song will cost at most R5 000/song (Mixing R3900 + Mastering R1100). A mixing engineer makes everything sound great together, making sure the guitar isn't too loud and the voice fits in the mix. Makes the bass not blow your car speaker. The mastering engineer is the polisher. Once the mixing engineer is done, he hands it over to this 'master'. The volume is also greatly increased without distorting the track.
PACKAGING - R5000
For the printing of the covers, cd casing, compact discs, writing of cd's and wrapping of 400 cd's will be around R5000.
DISTRIBUTION - R10 000
This is the most important part for us, to be heard. For us to get our music heard on radio stations, cd's in shops and on Itunes it'll cost minumum R10 000. The reason why we say mimimum is because, we can not distribute enough. It's an on going procedure, but with the sales of our 400 albums, merchandise, etc we can keep it going. 
It all comes down to an amount of R 75, 000 / $ 5, 750                     _____________________________
“This diversity emerges in a genre-bending blend of rock, pop and funk, and an extensive repertoire of standards and original compositions, presented in an appealing, high-energy package, with lashings of stage presence.”  Maggie Follet, JOURNALIST ____________________________



         PERKS! What you get for helping us out...
If you look on the right hand side of your screen you will see all the perks. We have            made a list of great perks and fan giveaways you'd love! CHECK IT OUT!


WHAT IF... we do not reach our fundraising goal? 
We will use that money to forward this project however possible. If it comes down to it, we will release an album with less tracks on it. 

We pledge to you that we will transparently use every cent raised on this specific album called ""Metal & Rust"".


THE IMPACT!!!
We have always been firm believers that music can change the world, one person at a time. We believe in our music and that is why we want to make sure it gets heard. Our first single, ""Out Of This World"" we released in 2013 we had a sold out show and within the first month of releasing it we were contacted by 2 European publishing companies that wanted to help us, but unfortunately things didn't go as planned. It was a massive letdown to hear the news of not completing a publishing deal, but how difficult it may be, we move forward.


    


RISKS & CHALLENGES? 

Of course there are! Time is always a major factor in any career. The 3 of us are all working and have to keep our head above water, while following our dream. We have cancelled personal events to make sure we keep on performing, bringing in some form of income. We will not give up on reaching our goal.Melony and Shawn have to drive at least 100km combined to practise or record every single time.____________________________________________________________________________

What we're asking for Typically Inspector Gadje is a home-grown and independent band.  We do all the music arranging, booking, and management on our own. But this is a heavyweight project and we’ll need your support to make this record.   We’ll have artist fees, recording fees, record production fees, and other costs outside of our usual budget.  Our community has supported us in so many ways – packing the concert halls, spreading the word and the buzz about the band, sharing sweet life celebrations such as wedding, and making so many great memories together. So we are inviting you into the making of this record. Join us in our biggest step yet!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</p><p>Greeting ladies and gentleman and welcome to my Indiegogo campaign to raise funds to record and produce my debut album <i>Some Enchanted Evening</i>
 which is really a snapshot of an era of Musical Theatre on Broadway 
featuring music which has made an impact on us until this very day. </p><div>
<p><b>The choice</b></p>
<p>Having enjoyed a varied career to date 
performing all kinds of repertoire, the choice for my first album was 
not easy. However, after months of consideration, contemplation and the 
all important market research with friends and family, I decided to 
record the songs from my new show <b>Some Enchanted Evening</b> so that I could represent myself in a genre that I have grown to love. </p>
<p><b>Forces</b></p>
<p>I am thrilled to announce that my pianist for the album will be <b>Christopher Gould </b>who
 actually played in the show itself. Christopher’s discography includes 
an English Song disc, The Water is Wide, with mezzo-soprano Diana Moore,
 and Who are these children?, a recording of Britten songs for BIS 
records with tenor Daniel Norman. His most recent CD of the Britten 
Canticles has just been released on Stone records. <br/></p>
<p><b>The Songs</b></p>
<p> <i>Lonely Town     </i>                        On The Town <i>                    Leonard Bernstein <br/></i></p>
<p><i>Ole Man River                            </i>Show Boat<i>                        Jerome Kern<br/></i></p>
<p><i>If I loved You                              </i>Carousel<i>                            Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein<br/></i></p>
<p><i>Soliloquy                                     </i>Carousel<i>                            Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein<br/></i></p>
<p><i>I Got Plenty O Nuttin               </i>Porgy &amp; Bess<i>                  George Gershwin<br/></i></p>
<p><i>Love Walked In                          </i>The Goldwyn Follies<i>     George Gershwin</i></p>

<p><i>The Impossible Dream           </i>Man of  La Mancha<i>       Mitch Leigh<br/></i></p>
<p><b>How your money will be spent</b></p>
<p>Your kind support will enable me to record, produce, market and distribute this 
album properly. I'm keen to share my renditions of these classics with 
as wide an audience as possible and also feel privileged to be able to 
say I made it with the help of those who care and appreciate my singing.
 </p>
<p>So, thank you for your support in which ever way you can show it.</p>
<p>I'll keep you updated throughout the progress!</p>
<p><b>Have a little listen</b></p>

<p></p>
<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>We will be recording throughout August 2015 with a release date 
planned for November 2015. This should cover any delays in the 
production of the album whilst also allowing plenty of time for the PR 
company to work its magic ahead of the album launch!</p>

performing all kinds of repertoire, the choice for my first album was 
not easy. However, after months of consideration, contemplation and the 
all important market research with friends and family, I decided to 
record the songs from my new show Some Enchanted Evening so that I could represent myself in a genre that I have grown to love. 
Forces
I am thrilled to announce that my pianist for the album will be Christopher Gould who
 actually played in the show itself. Christopher’s discography includes 
an English Song disc, The Water is Wide, with mezzo-soprano Diana Moore,
 and Who are these children?, a recording of Britten songs for BIS 
records with tenor Daniel Norman. His most recent CD of the Britten 
Canticles has just been released on Stone records.

How your money will be spent
Your kind support will enable me to record, produce, market and distribute this 
album properly. I'm keen to share my renditions of these classics with 
as wide an audience as possible and also feel privileged to be able to 
say I made it with the help of those who care and appreciate my singing.
 
So, thank you for your support in which ever way you can show it.
I'll keep you updated throughout the progress!

Risks and challenges
We will be recording throughout August 2015 with a release date 
planned for November 2015. This should cover any delays in the 
production of the album whilst also allowing plenty of time for the PR 
company to work its magic ahead of the album launch!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

CONTRIBUTION</b><br/></p>
<p>By supporting THE NEW QUORUM, you contribute directly to the
cultural life of New Orleans.  While most
artist residencies provide a tranquil and secluded environment, THE NEW QUORUM
offers visiting musicians full immersion in our city’s unique culture. Local musicians benefit tremendously from THE NEW QUORUM’s residencies,
as they discover musical
inspiration, new creative collaborations, and enhanced career opportunities by
participating in the program.</p>
<p>New
Orleans musicians currently face a wide array of challenges, ranging from a
global music industry that now undervalues and underpays artists to the accelerating
gentrification in our city, all of which makes it difficult for musicians and
artists of all types to survive. Given this reality, it’s imperative that New
Orleans musicians seize every opportunity for personal and professional
development.</p>
<p>THE NEW
QUORUM has assumed an important role in providing that support. Executive
Director and Founder Gianna Chachere has more than 20 years executive experience with non-profit
organizations. Artists and other local non-profits are quickly coming on board
to collaborate with us on fulfilling our mission. Your generous participation
helps ensures the program’s success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>THE NEW QUORUM takes
its name from The Quorum, the famous 1960s coffee house/artist collective (also
located on Esplanade Avenue) that<span> created a
successful model for multicultural exchange. The Quorum became a frequent target of
segregationist harassment in New Orleans after it opened to persons from all
racial backgrounds in 1963. Many musicians, poets, and artists spent time at
The Quorum including Ellis Marsalis and Jerry Jeff Walker, among many others.</span></p>
<br/>
<p><b>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN

<p>There are many ways to support the mission of THE NEW

artist residencies provide a tranquil and secluded environment, THE NEW QUORUM
offers visiting musicians full immersion in our city’s unique culture. Local musicians benefit tremendously from THE NEW QUORUM’s residencies,
as they discover musical
inspiration, new creative collaborations, and enhanced career opportunities by
participating in the program.
New
Orleans musicians currently face a wide array of challenges, ranging from a
global music industry that now undervalues and underpays artists to the accelerating
gentrification in our city, all of which makes it difficult for musicians and
artists of all types to survive. Given this reality, it’s imperative that New
Orleans musicians seize every opportunity for personal and professional
development.
THE NEW
QUORUM has assumed an important role in providing that support. Executive
Director and Founder Gianna Chachere has more than 20 years executive experience with non-profit
organizations. Artists and other local non-profits are quickly coming on board
to collaborate with us on fulfilling our mission. Your generous participation
helps ensures the program’s success.

THE NEW QUORUM takes
its name from The Quorum, the famous 1960s coffee house/artist collective (also
located on Esplanade Avenue) that created a
successful model for multicultural exchange. The Quorum became a frequent target of
segregationist harassment in New Orleans after it opened to persons from all
racial backgrounds in 1963. Many musicians, poets, and artists spent time at
The Quorum including Ellis Marsalis and Jerry Jeff Walker, among many others.

OTHER WAYS YOU CAN
HELP

QUORUM. At present, we need volunteers to help staff our upcoming public

Orleans.

<p>The music is what really matters here. It speaks for itself and doesn't need me prattling on about it. Go listen now. Then come back and we'll talk.</p>
<p><a href=""http://soundcloud.com/signalmusicdg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://soundcloud.com/signalmusicdg</a></p>
<p>The song creation process for me is like witnessing the magic of life unimpeded. Something takes me over and creates it all. My part in it is akin to the kid who claps is hands after a magician pulls a rabbit out of a hat. I never know what the end result is going to be, and I'm always only given the very next step. Once a song is completed I always end up thinking to myself ""who created that? it wasn't me but there's no one else in the room!"" I never have any idea where a song is headed, but it seems that the more my logical mind stays out of the equation, the better the end result becomes. When I get out of the way and release all attempts at control, the universe never disappoints.  I don't stop working on a song until it literally makes me jump out of my seat and dance around like a crazy person who just found out that it's everyone else who's crazy.</p>
<p>This music comes unfiltered from the magic of life and it is the greatest joy to experience that magic directly every time I sit down to work.</p>
<p>In terms of where i see all this headed, I will echo the words of Jonsi, lead singer of Sigur Ros, ""I will change the way people listen to music forever. You don’t think i can? I can and I will.""</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">How Khu.éex' Began</b></h2>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Khu.éex’ began with a chance meeting between Bernie Worrell and Preston
Singletary through a crowd-funding program where Bernie was raising funds for a tour bus. Preston invited Bernie to perform at his birthday party, where Preston sang Bernie a traditional Native song to welcome him. Bernie sat down
with his keyboards and began improvising on the melody that was still
lingering in the air. He created a spontaneous, psychedelic and soulful
composition right on the spot.</span>
</div><div>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The
next day Bernie asked Preston’s band, “A Little Big Band” (a Native funk/soul band)
to be the opening act for his show. After the concert Bernie shared with Preston
that he had been thinking about his music, had several exciting ideas, and that
they should record together. A union was formed.</span></p>

</div></div>","Khu.éex’
Tlingit tribal member Preston Singletary, an internationally known glass sculptor, honed this sonic vision
of collaboration with other major musicians including the legendary Bernie
Worrell, Skerik, Stanton Moore, Captain Raab, and tribal members, Clarissa
Rizal, Gene Tagaban and Nahaan.
Khu.éex’ (prounced koo-eex) translates to “Potlatch” in the Tlingit language, a Native tribal group from Southeast Alaska. Singletary thought of the name Khu.éex' because of the notion of
sharing culture, stories, and music. This is the intent of the project, to
present a contemporary interpretation of our culture and release our unique
project, ""The Wilderness Within"",  on double vinyl.


Khu.éex'
features spoken word, Native storytelling, and singing, performed with an
experimental approach with rock/funk aspects. Our band also performs in
traditional regalia and NW coast masks. 

Be part of this collaborative project by helping us release our debut album on double vinyl! Every gift matters, in any amount, to help us towards our goal of raising $25,000. Select your Perk at the right of this page.

How Khu.éex' Began
Khu.éex’ began with a chance meeting between Bernie Worrell and Preston
Singletary through a crowd-funding program where Bernie was raising funds for a tour bus. Preston invited Bernie to perform at his birthday party, where Preston sang Bernie a traditional Native song to welcome him. Bernie sat down
with his keyboards and began improvising on the melody that was still
lingering in the air. He created a spontaneous, psychedelic and soulful
composition right on the spot.

The
next day Bernie asked Preston’s band, “A Little Big Band” (a Native funk/soul band)
to be the opening act for his show. After the concert Bernie shared with Preston
that he had been thinking about his music, had several exciting ideas, and that
they should record together. A union was formed.




What We've Done and What We Need
Two
years, three recording sessions and three performances later there are four
hours of music already recorded. Khu.éex’ has been working hard at Avast Studio
in Seattle with the notable Randall Dunn (Engineer/Record Producer of the Cave
Singers, Boris, Earth, and a founding member of Master Musicians of Bukkake) to create our unique collaborative music project.

After three inspirational
recordings of basic tracks and several days of overdubbing, Khu.éex’ is asking for
your vital help to release our album, ""The Wilderness Within"",   on double vinyl.
In addition to releasing ""The Wilderness Within"" Khu.éex’ will use funds raised for future production costs for continuing our music. We expect that once funded our album will have a turn around time of 3-5 months.

<p>Great question! But first a little story. <b><a href=""http://blackmasala.com/home"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Black Masala</a> </b>came to fruition a little over 3 years ago in the basement of a row house in the groovy neighborhood of Bloomingdale in Washington, DC. Our first show in Columbia Heights was a smashing success and we knew then we might be on to something! We've seen several members come and go, but true to our passion and restless spirit, we've been able to log 200 plus shows over the last 3 years and record and release our own first record. <b>With no plan of stopping, we CALL ON YOU to help us continue our success by helping us fund the recording of a new 3 Year Anniversary Album.</b> It's the 3 Year Anniversary of the band this year. Let's celebrate and make an album.</p>

<br/><p></p><p><br/></p></div>","Great question! But first a little story. Black Masala came to fruition a little over 3 years ago in the basement of a row house in the groovy neighborhood of Bloomingdale in Washington, DC. Our first show in Columbia Heights was a smashing success and we knew then we might be on to something! We've seen several members come and go, but true to our passion and restless spirit, we've been able to log 200 plus shows over the last 3 years and record and release our own first record. With no plan of stopping, we CALL ON YOU to help us continue our success by helping us fund the recording of a new 3 Year Anniversary Album. It's the 3 Year Anniversary of the band this year. Let's celebrate and make an album.





We are Washington, D.C.'s own 8-piece Gypsy/ Brass/ Funk/ Rock Music inspired Brass Band, and winner of two Washington Area Music ""WAMMIE"" Awards for ""Best New Artist"" and ""Best World Album of the Year."" Members of the band include:


Mike Ounallah – Vocals,
Drums, Percussion

Kristen Long – Vocals,
Percussion

Monty Montgomery –
Sousaphone, Vocals, Percussion

Yannick LePage – Accordion

Kirsten Warfield – Trombone

Steven Cunningham – Trumpet

Duff Davis – Electric
Guitar

Tomas Drgon – Guitar, Vocals, Percussion

Matt Hotez - Trombone (Emeritus)



This campaign will help us to raise $5,000 towards the making of a brand new album being recorded in May 2015. We have many of the songs written already, and we feel like we will be putting out some of our strongest work to date.

Your contributions to this campaign will support: Recording, Mixing, and Mastering costs. Publicity and PR Representation. Tour Support. Remixes (Oh yeah!). Special guests... (It's a surprise). A New Tuba (Just Kidding! -- Monty plays Sousaphone). And a host of other costs that come into play when making a new album especially one with....count 'em.... 8 PEOPLE!!!!

Studio Invites to sit-in on the recording of Black Masala's new album

Custom Artwork and Clothing
VIP Passes to a live show of your choice
Live Performance/Party and Educational Clinics Packages 






Outside of the usual cost of recording an album, the funding for this campaign will help this DC band put out their second album and keep spreading the music around the country and worldwide. Independent artists thrive from support by music lovers and fans.


Your contribution to this campaign now only gets you personalized goodies from the band, but will also help us obtain the essential funding needed to record and produce our new album in May 2015. We will also be touring after the release of the new album, so any extra funds will go towards publicity and travel costs.   THE MUSIC:

<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>Guitarist, singer, songwriter and composer Dan Beck has been writing and performing original music for over 40 years. His music is a combination of Blues &amp; Jazz, with a bit of rock, Latin, and classical thrown in - a genre he calls Blue Jazz.  In the past he appeared as a solo musician, both vocal and instrumental, playing guitar with a unique finger picking style learned from his early classical training. Here is what Dan Beck has to say about his band:</p>
<ul>
<li>I moved to California from the east coast over 15 years ago and didn't know any local musicians.  When I met Robert Rosett at a downtown restaurant, we started jamming together and performing publicly as a duo. Often his son, Ben (founder and drummer in the Strawberry Girls) would sit in on percussion - it was inspiring to play with other musicians again!  I also met an amazing bass player and all around excellent human being, the late Stephanie  R. Woehrmann, who became my friend and co-conspirator.</li>
<li>As a volunteer at the Downtown Salinas Visitor Center, I met the band's drummer, Dave Prentice, as well as our violinist, Tyler Reilly. Both serendipitous encounters when they heard me playing guitar and walked in to see who it was. We started jamming together and suddenly we had a full band. After Stephanie passed away in early 2016, Pablo Nuñez, a longtime family friend joined in as the band's bass player.</li>
<li>In the past I've always recorded at my home studio using vintage reel to reel equipment because I love the rich analog sound.  I've produced four CDs as a solo artist in this manner. With your help, I, and my band will be able to achieve a special dream: a vinyl album - I'm sure the first of many! - in addition to compact discs and digital downloads on iTunes and Amazon.</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2016, the Dan Beck Band went into the studio to record an album, ""All The Fish Are Hoppin'"". They chose The Real to Reel Studio in Sand City, California because the owner, Gary Sousa, uses analog tape to record on, providing that rich, big sound that vinyl is popular for.  The band now has the material professionally recorded and mastered - ready for the next step, burning and pressing.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This is what we are asking for:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need funding to produce 1000 Compact Disc &amp; 500 Vinyl albums.</li>
<li>Our perks are so cool! CD, Vinyl, Collectable Limited Addition Poster, Band T-Shirt, Reusable Water Bottle, VIP Admission to the Album Release Party, and even a LIVE PERFORMANCE at your party or event!</li>
<li>If our goal is not completely realized, we will still produce CDs, posters, t-shirts, etc. as well as hold the release party on March 31st, 2017.  And the vinyl will come later.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We want you to know the difference your contribution will make:</p>
<ul>
<li>We know our music is great and this project is valuable to you, the contributor, and to the world by enabling us to share our awesome music on vinyl, continuing the audiophile tradition of many great music artists.</li>
<li>As a solo artist, Dan Beck has produced and released six and a half (an EP) CDs.</li>
<li>With the Dan Beck Band, he has released a limited edition EP compact disc and recorded many songs currently available as digital downloads on iTunes and Amazon. The culmination of this project, a vinyl album, is the epitome of the recording process.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have the music ready to go and we have done the research for the best value and quality of the project.  It is on a short timeline and there will not be a wait for perks.</p>
<ul>
<li>The biggest (and only) hurdle we need to overcome is funding to press &amp; burn All the Fish Are Hoppin'.</li>
<li>Our plan for solving this challenge was to launch our crowd funding 'Pre-Sale' campaign on IndieGoGo.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We know some of you just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't assist the cause:</p>
<ul>
<li>Help us to get the word out and make some noise about our album.</li>
<li>Share on your Facebook timeline, send a Tweet, give us a shout out on Instagram, and please feel free to use the Indiegogo share tools!</li>

<p>Hello! My name is <a href=""http://www.eunbikimmusic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Eunbi Kim</a>, and I'm a professional pianist based in New York City. I've previously created, produced, performed/toured in a music-theatre piece inspired by author Haruki Murakami in <a href=""http://www.MurakamiMusic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Murakami Music</a>.

Fred is widely known for his monumental work as a pianist, composer, improviser, bandleader, and educator in the world of jazz.

<h3>The Ale House String Band Presents: ""Chasing Gold""</h3>
<p>Hello Ale-Housians! It has been 4 years since the release of our debut album ""Affairs of Common Living,"" a live-recorded session album of Traditional songs. The recording/mixing/mastering/printing of that project was completely funded by our fans, and we are back to ask for your assistance once more! </p>
<p><strong>Who we are:</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491088639/gm9g1wfysynqe45mbbfm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p>Brian Dunn, vocal/mandolin/mandola</p>
<p>April Reed-Cox, vocal/cello</p>
<p>Oren Robinson, vocal/guitar/dulcimer</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are striking out on a new road as a band, and have written and recorded an entire album's worth of brand new songs! We created a small home recording studio in Oren and April's basement and have spent the last 4 months  recording and editing our songs. We had initially planned on mixing our album as well, thus creating an entirely self-produced CD, but a string of winter colds and some very meaningful (but time consuming) projects made this goal less and less viable as the weeks went on.</p>
<p>Due to these setbacks we have hired our friend Jud Caswell of Frog Hollow Studio, who recorded/mixed/mastered our last album, to take on the task of mixing and mastering our new album. We received his first mixes on March 30th and they sound AMAZING!</p>
<p>In addition, we are partnering with Jud to record our live show on April 15th, 2017, at <i>Johnson Hall</i> in Gardiner, Maine. Our goal is to capture a live studio recording of our four newest songs, with an interactive audience, so that we can add them to the 10 tracks that are already recorded.</p>
<p>We hope that you will consider donating to our project!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Breakdown:</h3>
<p>Our minimum goal is to raise $2,000.00, which will allow us to pay for the mixing/mastering, printing cost for 100 copies of our album, and most of Indiegogo's fee. Every dollar that we raise once we have met our initial goal will allow us to print more copies of the album.</p>

<p>If we are able to raise enough funds to print 500 copies of the CD, we will use any extra funding to update our website, hire a professional photographer to take new band photos, and expand our band-based merchandise offerings. Our goal is to hire a few of our amazingly talented friends to do this work, supporting our local artists and designers along the way.  </p>

The arts festival is a great opportunity for us to grow our offering and also link with other festival creators to possibly take our tour to continental and international stages.· This is my first nation-wide tour. Fans have been wanting to see me and I have never been able to bring my music to them until now.What We Need & What You GetWe need to raise $5000 that will go towards:Flights 6 people $1700Accommodation for 6 people 8 nights $1500S & T  $1300Technical Requirements  $500WHAT YOU GET.......... AN EXCLUSIVE NEW ACCAPELLA RELEASE!!!I Love creating music and its the best gift i can give to you. With whatever contribution you make you will receive some new music.  The Impact· Your contribution to this campaign will really help me in putting together an amazing show for the audience. Knowing that I don’t have to worry about transport and accommodation I will be able to just focus on the music. My music is so important to me and I really want to share my nest with you. You have waited long enough to see me, you deserve nothing but the best of me and that’s what I plan on show casing in Grahamstown.  ChallengesI have attempted to take a show to Grahamstown before as Samthing Soweto unfortunately the funders were unable to pull through. This year i will not allow that to happen. Do not underestimate your helping hand.  Other Ways You Can HelpI know that not everyone can help financially but you may know people that can. Please share the link with all of your friends and family, who knows I might gain new fans who are able to help make this a reality.And that's all there is to it.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Introduction

What's up everyone welcome to my Indiegogo! My name is Andrew Barrack and I'm a singer-songwriter from San Diego, CA. I create feel-good pop music with elements of jazz, reggae, and rock. It's my goal to connect people through the message and the power of the music itself.
My goal with your support is to release an EP of 8 perfectly produced and recorded songs. Your contribution will allow me to fully bring my songs and passion to life and in return you will receive a product that we can all share and be proud of. A New Story & New Direction
As some of you might know, I recorded a 7 song EP in 2014 and a single in 2015.
https://soundcloud.com/andrew-barrack/sets/some-ep-tracks-single
There's been a lot  happening since then and my new songs are here to tell you the story. They're a step in a new direction lyrically and musically. Every lyric on this album means something to me, the instrumentals have more bite, and the production will be, as they say...next level.
Your contribution will go directly towards the following:
• Studio time
• Production, Mixing Mastering
• Design & Duplication of the Album and Artwork
• Travel Expenses
• And Anything Else to Make this Record the Best it Can Be!

* My goal is to have this album finished & in your hands by December 2016.
* Perks will also be delivered in December, if not sooner.

Industry Challenges

The biggest challenge in this industry is being heard. There are so many musicians out there trying to do their thing, not only in San Diego but all over the world. That's no secret. However, this album will give listeners the opportunity to fully appreciate my unique sound and enable me to stand out among the crowd. I am fully confident in my team and in YOU  to help me achieve this goal. 



The Goods


To the right are some pretty cool perks that you can choose to receive in return for your support. Anything from a single download or a signed CD + stickers, to having me come play your next event, or cook you dinner, and tons more! In addition,  everyone who contributes will live on the album forever in the liner notes!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Please share this project with all your friends and ask them to share it with their friends. If you are press or have a blog feel free to link to this page and use anything from my site. You can message me via the ""contact"" button with any questions.
And THANK YOU so much for your support and contributions. I am very excited for what this album will bring and what we can do together!
Sincerely, 
Andrew Barrack

Ben and I met Earl at CMW's mentoring cafe and that's where the fire was truly sparked. incredibly, Earl and Ben have offered their services free of charge because they believe in the music I'm making; I can't even begin to explain how validating and overwhelming this is, and it is yet more fuel on the fire that proves this is an opportunity that cannot be missed.</p>
<p>Although Earl and Ben have offered their services for free, there are significant costs associated with flying Earl up from LA, and myself (with gear) from Vancouver, and keeping a roof over our heads, and food in our bellies while we're there. There is no way I can cover this cost, but I can't let this incredible chance slip by, and I can't let Earl and Ben incur any more financial burden than they already will be, by providing me with their amazing talents and services.</p>
<p>I'm a hard working musician, and I put my soul into every word I sing and every note I play, I live and breathe music, and with this team behind me, who knows what could happen!  If you too, believe in the music I'm making, and want to see it taken to the next level, please become a backer, donate and help make the magic happen.</p>

<p>""<i>I recently had the opportunity to record a live-off-the floor session with Matt Hoyles at Kensington Sound, where he proceeded to totally floor me. Matt oozes a sort of raw passion in his performances that I haven't really seen from anyone else to date. A true original, old soul, and heart-stopping musician. Seeing him live at the Paddock in front of a mesmerized crowd of professionals who gave him a standing ovation during CMW solidified my opinion.</i></p>

<h3>Where will your money be going?</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, Earl and Ben are donating their time and talents, we need funding for travel, accommodation, and daily costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Around $1400 in flights for Earl and myself, including excess fees for my instruments.</li>
<li>Lodging and food for Earl and myself for a week. </li>
<li>Travel within the city, between accommodation and the studio.</li>
<li>A per diem for Ben to prevent any extra losses of income.</li>
<li>coverage of paypal transfer fees, and credit card processing fees being deducted from the total</li>
</ul>
<p>This in total equates to a minimum of $3200, not including the ability to pay Earl and Ben for their services, or my loss of income from cancelling a week of work, so anything over the goal would be immensely appreciated.</p>
<p>I'm a full time musician, earning my daily wage as a guitar teacher, and as such I pretty much live hand to mouth. If I could achieve this without asking for help, I truly would. I am forever indebted for your support and understanding. In the music industry as it is today, we really depend on our fans more than ever, and I am grateful for every one of you.</p>
<p><strong>​Any funds raised over the goal will be put towards making the record. This means paying the guys for their work, and getting CD's produced and tracks put on </strong><b>iTunes/Spotify etc. If I want a full production run of CD's licensed and pressed, we're talking at least $1000 (including digital distribution and design fees), so absolutely anything over the goal would be a Godsend.</b></p>

“ The best live performance I've seen in the last 2 years. That's crazy, because my job requires me to check out live performances all the time. ""
Henca Maduro, Rotterdam, Netherlands -C.E.O at Epitome Entertainment - New Skool Rules 
""I love this guy! Dude can play and his vocals are worldly!""
Lou Plaia - Co-Founder/EVP Music Industry & Artist Relations ReverbNation
""...was very fortunate to see and hear more than several great bands @ 'CMW'. Matt Hoyles truly 'moved the needle' in a way that I haven't experienced in quite some time...""
a.T fortuna - Damp Interactive, NYC
""I recently had the opportunity to record a live-off-the floor session with Matt Hoyles at Kensington Sound, where he proceeded to totally floor me. Matt oozes a sort of raw passion in his performances that I haven't really seen from anyone else to date. A true original, old soul, and heart-stopping musician. Seeing him live at the Paddock in front of a mesmerized crowd of professionals who gave him a standing ovation during CMW solidified my opinion.
Matt is THE one to watch.All hail the return of real music!”
Ben Pelchat - Producer / Owner, Kensington Sound Studios, Toronto
 

Where will your money be going?
As mentioned above, Earl and Ben are donating their time and talents, we need funding for travel, accommodation, and daily costs:

Around $1400 in flights for Earl and myself, including excess fees for my instruments.
Lodging and food for Earl and myself for a week. 
Travel within the city, between accommodation and the studio.
A per diem for Ben to prevent any extra losses of income.
coverage of paypal transfer fees, and credit card processing fees being deducted from the total

This in total equates to a minimum of $3200, not including the ability to pay Earl and Ben for their services, or my loss of income from cancelling a week of work, so anything over the goal would be immensely appreciated.
I'm a full time musician, earning my daily wage as a guitar teacher, and as such I pretty much live hand to mouth. If I could achieve this without asking for help, I truly would. I am forever indebted for your support and understanding. In the music industry as it is today, we really depend on our fans more than ever, and I am grateful for every one of you.
​Any funds raised over the goal will be put towards making the record. This means paying the guys for their work, and getting CD's produced and tracks put on iTunes/Spotify etc. If I want a full production run of CD's licensed and pressed, we're talking at least $1000 (including digital distribution and design fees), so absolutely anything over the goal would be a Godsend.

<p>Would you risk everything you worked for, everything you’ve built, for a chance at a new life—a new love—one with limitless possibilities?</p>
<p>Hi there…we’re John Sparks, Jake Anthony and Patricia Zehentmayr—book writer, composer, and lyricist (respectively)—and that’s the question our protagonist John has to answer in our musical <i>Wanting Miss Julie, </i>currently having it’s first full production at the Loft Ensemble in downtown Los Angeles (Saturdays and Sundays through May 8th, tickets available at <a href=""http://www.loftensemble.com."" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.loftensemble.com.</a>) After having done many staged readings and workshop productions of this show both in Los Angeles and Chicago, we can’t begin to tell you how exciting/overwhelming it is to see the piece in a fully staged production, complete with lighting, costumes, choreography, and a fully orchestrated score…with a BAND! </p><h3><strong>Recording the score!</strong></h3>
<p>
</p><p>So of course, in the middle of our inaugural six week run, we’re starting to think about future productions (“limitless possibilities” right?), and we thought: we have a fully rehearsed band and a fantastic cast—let’s make a complete recording of the score! In the past, we’d made some simple piano/vocal demos, but this <i>Julie </i>that’s on stage now has new songs, new lyrics; it barely resembles the piece we hear in previous recordings. Over the years that we have been workshopping  this show we have had many requests from audience members to have a recording of the score- but we've been reluctant to share our piano demos because they were only a sketch of our total vision.<em><strong> ""this is an intense and musically diverse (score) where the music style and emotion actually move the story's own passions..."" -The Geek Authority.</strong></em></p><h3><strong>The future of <em>Julie</em></strong></h3>
<p>
</p><p>So…the next logical step in the evolution of <i>Wanting Miss Julie</i> is a fully produced recording of the entire score. In today’s theater market, new musicals are a hard sell. Producers, Artistic Directors—they all want to know exactly what they’re getting when they take a chance on a new show. Piano recordings, while they've gotten us this far, aren't enough anymore. Furthermore, the music of <i>Julie</i> comes alive in living color in its orchestrations in a way we don’t get in the piano version of the score. A soulful clarinet wail transports us to a seedy jazz club, where Julie serenades us with a torchy ballad. Castanets power Julie’s tango, as she attempts her first seduction of the unwitting John.  The flute soothes Julie into a numb reverie, while she waits for her long lost mother to return.   THIS version of the score reflects <i>Wanting Miss Julie </i>in its current (and strongest) form, and this orchestrated version is the one that will secure future productions.</p><h3><strong>Where the funding goes</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p> So here’s where YOU come in. We need to raise $2300 to make this recording happen. The funding will go studio rental, a sound engineer, musicians and vocalists. And by helping us reach this goal, you’ll get to hear the finished tracks, in their fully orchestrated and fully mixed glory!</p><p>

Our goal is to blend a centuries old art form with current music, in order to bring a more modern feel to the practice. Plus we love shaking our booty to Beyonce in down dog! We will be the first studio in Colorado to bring this new twist on yoga to the mat in our own unique style. Offered in both NYC and Colorado, Soulga has grown to be a fun and playful practice that supports growth, community, mindfulness and inspiration.<p></p> </div><div>

<div>
<b>Ashley - Founder and Teacher</b> </div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">A Pueblo Native turned New Yorker, Ashley has spent the last decade working in the Fashion industry. With a keen eye for aesthetic, she quickly learned how much atmosphere and visual surroundings affect the mood, clarity, and over all disposition people, as well as general happiness. After receiveing her certification, she started exploring different venues, styles, teachers, and of course music. Studying under some of the best teachers and most innovative styles, Ashley sought out to make her own mark on the Yoga and Movement world. She began by pairing yoga and modern contemporary music in unexpected venues, and Soulga was born.</span></div>

</div></div>","WHO WE ARESoulga's mission is to bridge the gap between the ancient tradition of Yoga and the contemporary world of music and pop culture. Our goal is to blend a centuries old art form with current music, in order to bring a more modern feel to the practice. Plus we love shaking our booty to Beyonce in down dog! We will be the first studio in Colorado to bring this new twist on yoga to the mat in our own unique style. Offered in both NYC and Colorado, Soulga has grown to be a fun and playful practice that supports growth, community, mindfulness and inspiration.

<p>The colorful cityscape of Havana.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>In the winter of 2016 I lived in Havana, Cuba for three months (thanks to my generous supporters on IndieGoGo!) studying Cuban music and dance. I met some talented musicians and, on a return trip this last December, started recording an album with a few of them. Moises Whittaker and Laura Napoles Martinez run a small studio called MO Records out of their home. As soon as we started making music together I knew it was something special and that I would have to return to continue the project with more time and a bigger budget.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501657848/geeoyxxxyspf6vasxbnx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Moises and I with some of the musicians who joined us at MO Records Studio.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I plan to bring along T Bruce Bowers (world class recording engineer who also happens to be my father...) to help us get the highest possible quality of recordings. We've worked together for many years in many capacities and have a great collaborative relationship, so his presence and expertise will be invaluable. My first trip to Cuba was cut a bit shorter than planned because he was diagnosed with stage 4 prostate cancer and I came home to be with my family. He is now in remission and feeling healthy and I'm looking forward to having him as part of this project. </p>

<p>Flashback to 2011 with my dad T Bruce Bowers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As some of you may know, I've been in love with Cuban music for many years over the course of my career as a pianist, songwriter, vocalist and dancer. I spent over 11 years learning all that I could about Cuban music, dance and culture. I've also spent a long time writing indie-folk songs and performing them. But now for the first time I'm bringing the two passions together into one beautiful melting pot. This has been my dream as an artist for a long time and the way it is unfolding is perfect and so, so exciting for me.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501653479/ysl9hqj8m8xpojz7vuoh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In John Lennon Park in Habana.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This particular album (working title ""SpiralBound"") made itself clear to me over the course of this last winter when I found myself writing a song once a month on the full moon. It was a long hard winter and each of these songs were steps along my journey, gifts from my deep, aching heart that helped me reach the next level of growth. As I pulled myself into the light one song at a time and finally looked back at where I'd come from, I saw something beautiful. A spiral. A series of patterns. The sum of everything I had once been. And so I became suddenly drawn to the Fibonacci sequence, spirals, the nautilus shell, and other patterns in the world. I saw how they were the same as my life, each chamber leading to the next and expanding upon itself, growing constantly bigger and more beautiful. 1 + 1 = 2, 1 + 2= 3, 2 + 3 = 5, 3 + 5 = 8... Each number is the sum of the previous two. Leading to infinity. </p>
<p>If all goes well, the album will be released in five portions, one each week, following the Fibonacci sequence starting on January 1st 2018. A new year. A full moon. A new spiral. I will share details as they are clarified. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to raise $12,000 to make this project happen. About half of that will be used up front for recording/traveling costs. The rest will go into post-production, making sure I delivery to your doorstep a beautiful product that I'm proud of.</p>
<p>Here's a breakdown of the budget:</p>
<p>Flights: $1,000</p>
<p>Travel/living expenses in Cuba: $2,000</p>
<p>Studio costs in Cuba: $1,000</p>
<p>Studio costs in USA: $2,000</p>
<p>Graphic Design and Layout: $900</p>
<p>Duplication: $2,000</p>
<p>Promotion/music video: $2,000</p>
<p>IndieGoGo Fees (10%): $1,100</p>
<p>______<br/>Total: $12,000</p>
<p>Bruce and I leave for Cuba on September 25th. If we don't reach our full goal amount by that time, I will find other funding sources for the post production upon our return. </p>
<p>My big picture plan is to buy a touring vehicle and live on the road for the next couple of years starting this spring, playing music around the country in support of this album. In the event that we surpass our funding goal, every penny will go towards the touring costs involved in this dream.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501658628/unx1traiie90uzepaxm0.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>My dream van!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I'm striving for simplicity, so I've limited the perks to a few really goods ones. The most obvious will be a shiny, signed copy of the album sent to you with lots of love and kisses. Other highlights are a solo Yazmin show in your living room, your name listed in the album booklet thank you's, a signed picture of the band, hand-written lyrics. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project is the next step for me as an artist, but it's also a personal chance to lessen the gap between two countries that are struggling to maintain relations right now. My last fundraiser was successful in getting me to Cuba for the first time and now the irresistible sabor of that country has gotten under my skin. It's become a part of me and part of my music that I want to share with all of you.</p>
<p>This is such a challenging and sensitive time in our country in regards to race, religion and gender equality. Part of me wonders if releasing an album of love songs is really that important. But then another part of me speaks up and says, ""YES!"" These songs come straight from my heart. My intention is that by sharing these I can shine a light on the love and humanity in all of us and inspire others to create and share their own stories. Let's all make art together!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Sharing this creation is scary. These songs are extremely personal and I'm terrified to put them out there. As a perfectionist, I'm already grieving the many ways the album will not be exactly as I picture it. But also, I'm excited for the many more ways it will become real and human and filled with beautiful flaws. I think it's only fitting, since the journey of these songs is all about realizing again and again that we are enough just as we are, human, struggling, loving, flawed.</p>

I am Cat Harris-White and I'm an independent artist located in Seattle WA.  I create, sing, perform and produce music under the name <strong>SassyBlack</strong>. You may know my work from my former group <a href=""https://www.subpop.com/artists/theesatisfaction"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>THEESatisfaction</strong></a> or my vocal appearances on Black Up &amp; Lese Majesty by <strong><a href=""https://www.subpop.com/artists/shabazz_palaces"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Shabazz Palaces</a></strong>.  </p><p>Last year I released my first solo album <i><strong><a href=""https://sassyblack.bandcamp.com/album/no-more-weak-dates"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">No More Weak Dates</a></strong> </i>to a fantastically warm reception, after finishing other project releases you might be familiar with – <i><strong><a href=""https://sassyblack.bandcamp.com/album/personal-sunlight"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Personal Sunlight</a></strong>, <strong><a href=""https://sassyblack.bandcamp.com/album/me-and-mines-cute-chicks"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Me and Mines (Cute Chicks)</a></strong>, <strong><a href=""https://sassyblack.bandcamp.com/album/pop-treasury-vol-1-nsync"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Pop Treasury Vol 1;*NSYNC</a></strong>,</i> etc.</p><p>Since then so much has happened including my first solo tour to Europe last fall! I spoke at <a href=""http://schedule.sxsw.com/2017/events/PP96530"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>SXSW</strong></a> &amp; <strong><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHcarIMqIT0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Pop Kultur Berlin</a></strong>, performed at several festivals (<strong><a href=""http://blog.kexp.org/2016/07/25/capitol-hill-block-party-day-3-sassyblack-navvi-absolute-monarchs-sashay/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Capitol Hill Block Party</a></strong>, <strong><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_5RILQXJj0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Treefort Music Fest</a></strong>, <strong><a href=""http://www.linecheckfestival.com/2016-edition/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Linecheck Festival (Milan)</a></strong>, <strong><a href=""http://www.mondosonoro.com/festivales-musica/bam-festival/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Barcelona Acciò Musical (Barcelona)</a></strong>, <strong><a href=""https://doebay.com/music-activities/doe-bay-fest/artists/#1465852027301-7155d70a-b80b"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Doe Bay</a></strong>, <strong><a href=""https://www.earshot.org/project/2016-earshot-jazz-festival-schedule/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Earshot Jazz Festival</a></strong>, <strong><a href=""http://www.daytrotter.com/live-shows/103.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Daytrotter Downs</a></strong>, etc.), performed a <strong><a href=""https://youtu.be/O2cwOqyY15I"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">KEXP Live In Studio</a></strong> as well as had my music featured on the <strong><a href=""http://www.adultswim.com/music/luxe/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Adult Swim compilation LUXE</a></strong>. As you can see, things in my solo career are moving pretty quickly!!</p><p>On June 23rd, I released my sophomore album <strong><a href=""https://sassyblack.bandcamp.com/album/new-black-swing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">New Black Swing</a></strong> independently. It's my seventh release in the past three years, can you believe it?! Like all my projects, this album was written, produced and performed by me.  And so far, this has been my most successful record yet, gaining praise not only from major publications like <strong><a href=""https://i-d.vice.com/en_us/article/papbvb/sassyblack-is-the-afrofuturist-funk-queen-watching-sci-fi-to-survive"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">i-d</a></strong>, <strong><a href=""https://www.nylon.com/articles/sassyblack-ill-wait-for-you-premiere"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">NYLON</a></strong> &amp; <strong><a href=""http://www.thefader.com/2017/05/10/sassyblack-games-premiere"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the FADER</a></strong>, but also from YOU, my family, friends and supporters!</p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>OH COOL, WHAT'S GOOD SASSY? WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?</strong></p><p>As I mentioned, people have responded so well to <i>New Black Swing</i> that it is definitely time for a full fledged North American and European tour! I manage and book myself and have been in contact with promoters and venues all over the world confirming venues for my live performances. So far, I have some great dates lined up including Seattle (8/31), Portland (9/6), London (10/13), Salt Lake City (9/9), Zürich (10/26) and many more to be announced.<br/> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS INDIEGOGO?</strong></p><p>As a Queer, Black woman, I rarely ever ask for help. With that said, this is what I like to call a ""vulnerability moment"". It's an opportunity for me to share myself in a different way and admit that I don't have all the answers and that I do need help from my fans and supporters. Going from being a indie artist to a signed (Sub Pop) artist back to an indie artist has been quite the journey and I wouldn't change a thing!  However, I have learned a lot during this time and asking for support for my tour will insure that I reach new venues outside the Pacific Northwest and share my music of love and empowerment. All in all, I am very excited to get to know my fans and supporters better and to continue to grow as a musician and share knowledge.</p><p><u>** For my Kickstarter supporters, a big THANK YOU for your support!!</u> As you know, Kickstarter is an “all or nothing” fundraising campaign platform. With your support, I was able reach a total of over $8,500 ($8,563), which I think is pretty stupendous, but fell short of the $20,000 goal I had listed. ! So, I am going to step out of my comfort zone and ask you a pretty big favor: PLEASE make that same pledge on this Indiegogo page!!    </p><p>I learned a lot from my Kickstarter campaign: I reduced my goal to $10,000, I reviewed the pledges to offer what intrigued you the most, and deleted others. The best thing about Indiegogo, is that it allows the artist to receive what is pledged!! This will allow you to truly fund my tour!!<br/><br/><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2cwOqyY15I&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;a"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503333534/quumvxft8d3scj1cgpdk.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/></a></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><br/>photo by Brady Harvey from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2cwOqyY15I&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;a"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">KEXP In Studio</a><br/> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>WHAT'S THE PLAN MA'AM?</strong></p><p>My tour kicks off August 31st and goes until mid November. Promoters and venues have been contacted, and so far 15 dates have been confirmed with more confirming almost every day!</p><p>- All perks will be scheduled in October and set in motion beginning in November when I return from tour.</p><p>- Merchandise Delivery has a few more steps involved which is below:</p><p>·        <u>October</u> = Buttons, Posters, CDs, Shirts, Vinyl go into production</p><p>·        <u>November</u> = Individual CD Mailings begins. If you ordered a package that includes a shirt (but not vinyl), your order will be shipped out by late November, which is great for holiday gift giving!</p><p>·        <u>February</u> = Vinyl inclusive packages mailings begin; If you ordered a package that includes Vinyl this will all be shipped together in February. * The wait on vinyl is so long because it takes 3 months to create and ship out vinyl and since it takes 2-4 weeks to process the Indiegogo funds, the vinyl cannot be ordered until October.<br/> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?</strong></p><p>It covers some of my expenses which include air, ground, and ferry travel, tour publicity &amp; media promotions, music videos, accommodations (I need somewhere to sleep and practice!) and of course, meals (I need to eat!). These are all things that are necessary to have a successful tour and many venues are unable to provide travel and accommodations for out of town artists.<br/> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT TO YOU SASS?</strong></p><p>It’s important to push yourself and try new things! My solo career is still a new thing for me and it is scary and magical, every day, but that’s why I love it!!

I am Cat Harris-White and I'm an independent artist located in Seattle WA.  I create, sing, perform and produce music under the name SassyBlack. You may know my work from my former group THEESatisfaction or my vocal appearances on Black Up & Lese Majesty by Shabazz Palaces.  Last year I released my first solo album No More Weak Dates to a fantastically warm reception, after finishing other project releases you might be familiar with – Personal Sunlight, Me and Mines (Cute Chicks), Pop Treasury Vol 1;*NSYNC, etc.Since then so much has happened including my first solo tour to Europe last fall! I spoke at SXSW & Pop Kultur Berlin, performed at several festivals (Capitol Hill Block Party, Treefort Music Fest, Linecheck Festival (Milan), Barcelona Acciò Musical (Barcelona), Doe Bay, Earshot Jazz Festival, Daytrotter Downs, etc.), performed a KEXP Live In Studio as well as had my music featured on the Adult Swim compilation LUXE. As you can see, things in my solo career are moving pretty quickly!!On June 23rd, I released my sophomore album New Black Swing independently. It's my seventh release in the past three years, can you believe it?! Like all my projects, this album was written, produced and performed by me.  And so far, this has been my most successful record yet, gaining praise not only from major publications like i-d, NYLON & the FADER, but also from YOU, my family, friends and supporters! OH COOL, WHAT'S GOOD SASSY? WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?As I mentioned, people have responded so well to New Black Swing that it is definitely time for a full fledged North American and European tour! I manage and book myself and have been in contact with promoters and venues all over the world confirming venues for my live performances. So far, I have some great dates lined up including Seattle (8/31), Portland (9/6), London (10/13), Salt Lake City (9/9), Zürich (10/26) and many more to be announced. WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS INDIEGOGO?As a Queer, Black woman, I rarely ever ask for help. With that said, this is what I like to call a ""vulnerability moment"". It's an opportunity for me to share myself in a different way and admit that I don't have all the answers and that I do need help from my fans and supporters. Going from being a indie artist to a signed (Sub Pop) artist back to an indie artist has been quite the journey and I wouldn't change a thing!  However, I have learned a lot during this time and asking for support for my tour will insure that I reach new venues outside the Pacific Northwest and share my music of love and empowerment. All in all, I am very excited to get to know my fans and supporters better and to continue to grow as a musician and share knowledge.** For my Kickstarter supporters, a big THANK YOU for your support!! As you know, Kickstarter is an “all or nothing” fundraising campaign platform. With your support, I was able reach a total of over $8,500 ($8,563), which I think is pretty stupendous, but fell short of the $20,000 goal I had listed. ! So, I am going to step out of my comfort zone and ask you a pretty big favor: PLEASE make that same pledge on this Indiegogo page!!    I learned a lot from my Kickstarter campaign: I reduced my goal to $10,000, I reviewed the pledges to offer what intrigued you the most, and deleted others. The best thing about Indiegogo, is that it allows the artist to receive what is pledged!! This will allow you to truly fund my tour!!    photo by Brady Harvey from KEXP In Studio WHAT'S THE PLAN MA'AM?My tour kicks off August 31st and goes until mid November. Promoters and venues have been contacted, and so far 15 dates have been confirmed with more confirming almost every day!- All perks will be scheduled in October and set in motion beginning in November when I return from tour.- Merchandise Delivery has a few more steps involved which is below:·        October = Buttons, Posters, CDs, Shirts, Vinyl go into production·        November = Individual CD Mailings begins. If you ordered a package that includes a shirt (but not vinyl), your order will be shipped out by late November, which is great for holiday gift giving!·        February = Vinyl inclusive packages mailings begin; If you ordered a package that includes Vinyl this will all be shipped together in February. * The wait on vinyl is so long because it takes 3 months to create and ship out vinyl and since it takes 2-4 weeks to process the Indiegogo funds, the vinyl cannot be ordered until October. WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?It covers some of my expenses which include air, ground, and ferry travel, tour publicity & media promotions, music videos, accommodations (I need somewhere to sleep and practice!) and of course, meals (I need to eat!). These are all things that are necessary to have a successful tour and many venues are unable to provide travel and accommodations for out of town artists. WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT TO YOU SASS?It’s important to push yourself and try new things! My solo career is still a new thing for me and it is scary and magical, every day, but that’s why I love it!! I challenge myself to take risks and learn more about myself and how I can help others and that is one of the best feelings in the world, outside of making music! RISKS AND CHALLENGESMy biggest risks are financial. My fans have been requesting that I come to their cities to perform live. With the support of all of you, as well as radio & print publicists, I can make their requests a reality. I have allotted myself a cushion in terms of the time it takes to get some of the perks done. If for some reason the timeline changes I will notify you immediately.The album is finished. I have researched the cost of merchandise and publicity firms. I have directors, designers, promoters, actors and videographers ready to create magic!There will always be fear in my line of creativity, but I feel that my nerves are healthy and proof that I am truly alive! It is also more important to me to try rather to give up before I give myself a chance to start.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>""Worthy of Love""</h3>
<p>My name is Matt Grigsby. I'm a 30 year old songwriter living in Denton, TX. I need your help producing an album I think is going to be special and meaningful to a lot of people. Let me explain. </p>
<p>I haven't put out an album in 4 years. I've written plenty of songs, I could put together another album right after this one but that doesn't mean I should. A good album is more than just a collection of songs. The songs should all work together towards the same message or feeling. And I think I finally have a group of songs that will do just that. </p>
<p>When we think of being ""Worthy of Love"" we immediately think of our romantic pursuits. And certainly romance is a huge factor in all of our lives, but there's more to it than that. There's also our sense of self-worth, and of finding our place in the universe, or even our own hometown. And I think we've all struggled with that. Because how much happiness is spent paying the rent is part of feeling worthy of love. And waking up Monday morning thinking, ""before long I may have to quit drinking"" is part of feeling worthy of love. Because looking back at failed relationships and hoping they're on the road to feeling good again is part of feeling worthy of love. And these songs have all that and more.</p>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>This album is currently being recorded in Denton, Texas at CaptivEar Studios and will be released October 5th with a release party at Dan's Silver Leaf. I'm seeking to raise $8000 to cover costs. This money will be used to pay for the amazing studio musicians we're bringing in to make this record worthy of your listening, as well as the packaging/duplication process, printing t-shirts, hiring a radio promoter, and promotions in general, and likely costs I don't even know exist yet. And your contributions will not go unrewarded. There are perks for donations as little as $5 or as much as $500. Some of the perks include an autographed copy of the CD, a CD and t-shirt, or a copy of the poster from the album release show. For a $250 contribution I will write a song based off any prompt you feed me. For a $1000 contribution I will come play a private concert in the comfort of your home, or wherever you choose. And if you find yourself unable to participate financially, as I often do, you'll still be able to help by sharing this campaign with friends and family who may want to be involved as well. Plus, Indiegogo provides several share tools to make this process easier. All of you can help make this a success.  </p>

<p>Hello, thank you for considering a donation to our Indiegogo campaign.  Burning Man is a giant art experience held on a large dry lakebed in the Black Rock Desert. Every year 70,000 people gather, build a huge city out of nothing - featuring incredible art and interactivity, and then dismantle it and leave the wonderful desert space in a condition better than when we arrived.</p>
<p>We love all that is Burning Man, and we want to support more diversity in the styles of music you can find there, so we bring high-quality, professional live Bluegrass music to the Playa!  Rootpile is a camp dedicated to exposing more folks to live Bluegrass music and Hillbilly culture and food (moonshine and BBQ!!).</p>
<p>This year we want to expand our offering to the community OUTSIDE of our camp, with <strong>The Rootpile Rolling Thunder Bluegrass Stage.</strong> This is a self-contained mobile stage and fire-shooting art car!  Rolling Thunder will be clad in North Carolina pine logs and look like your granny’s front porch!  Inside our camp, we host Bluegrass lessons and nightly concerts (with dinner!) by our professional house band, Black Rock Bluegrass.  Getting those pros out and about to other camps and spaces is what Rolling Thunder is all about!</p>
<p>Challenges with this project:  going to Burning Man is a challenge in itself, and coordinating a 75-person camp (and its infrastructure) with nightly live music and food is even more so.  But, in this - our fifth year out, we want to spread the Bluegrass love far(ther) and wide(r)!</p>
<p><strong>Our mission is to bring live Bluegrass somewhere it’s never been, and we are committed to that. We have set a fundraising goal that will be solely dedicated to the construction and transport of Rolling Thunder.</strong> Hey, if a guy can raise $55,000 to make potato salad then surely, we can raise the money to take the “greatest music in the world” to Burning Man?! Help us bring Bluegrass Music to the dusty masses!!</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Aloha... my name is Toni Childs, I am an Emmy Winner and three time Grammy nominated recording artist, installation artist, environmental activist and yoga teacher. In a nut shell, I am an impact artist, and I have developed a new music driven 3D Mapping Concert Experience - 'It's All a Beautiful Noise'. To listen to my new music click <strong><a href=""http://tonichilds.com/release/its-all-a-beautiful-noise/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a></strong>. </p>
<p>This is two hours of music and off-the-hook 3D mapping animations by Barcelona based Tigrelab. My show is designed to inspire a ground swell of support for our littlest angels - the Bees and other Pollinators who are facing collapse. (Click on the video below to watch Tigrelab's Projection Reel. This will give an idea of the quality and scope of their work.)</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/80477646?color=ffffff&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
<p>My show is unique on a few fronts, most notable is that it was designed to keep audiences engaged for up to five months - before, during and after the show by using life size Visy Recycled paper animal installations that are installed three months BEFORE the show comes to town, and six simple white paper hats of pollinators with addressable LED lights that are given to audience members at the show. And guess what? I get to control lights in the hats from the stage - fun fun fun!!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1510964684/vi4bwj6jou4pchul3rme.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Now the really cool part for me is that each hat is connected to a different environmental organization with the URL of the organization on the underside of the hat. Each organization is asked to take the audience member on a journey AFTER the concert- a treasure hunt so to speak - to experience five online hero moments that end asking the audience member to send their hat to a yet to be specified physical location where all the hats become part of a large public installation and a beautiful tremendous voice for our pollinators! I am presently in talking with Green Peace, World Wild Life Fund, ICUN Red List and NGOs local to different countries we will be touring.</p>
<p>Bee populations collapsed 41% in the US last year... !! To give these beautiful creatures a voice I have created a High-Tech inspirational interactive playdate with an environmental message.  The production will travel to regional areas of the US, Canada, Australia and Europe inspiring people to stop buying chemicals and the chemical laden products that are contributing to the collapse of our littlest angels our pollinators.</p>
<p>The theme for my show is ""We are all pollinators, what we buy we grow!"" </p>
<p>We are actually corporate farmers... if we don't buy it, it won't grow!</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need...</h3>
<p>My goal is to raise 350K for all the elements that make up the show in this crowd-funding campaign:</p>
<ol>
<li>The design, fabrication and build of three popup sets for my shows in the US, Europe and Australia. (I am fabricating three sets in three different countries to reduce international shipping costs to our touring company.);</li>
<li><p>Two hours of 3D animation mixed with live action footage;</p></li>
<li><p>An exoskeletal suit that brings the show together ;</p></li>
<li><p>Four weeks with a Dramaturge to really nut-out the flow of the show and tighten the storytelling elements; </p></li>
<li><p>And a full four weeks of production rehearsals in Barcelona bringing all the elements together: the music, the set, 3D animations, lights, sound and storytelling.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Your buy-in means we can bring contemporary art with an environmental message to cities and regional areas. This will give us a shot at changing some minds about the chemicals people use in areas where environmental activism is usually a dirty word. </p>
<p><i>""Where would we be without bees? As far as important species go, they are top of the list. They are critical pollinators: they pollinate 70 of the around 100 crop species that feed 90% of the world. Honey bees are responsible for $30 billion a year in crops.</i></p>
<p><i>That’s only the start. We may lose all the plants that bees pollinate, all of the animals that eat those plants and so on up the food chain. Which means a world without bees could struggle to sustain the global human population of 7 billion. Our supermarkets would have half the amount of fruit and vegetables.</i></p>
<p><i>It gets worse. We are losing bees at an alarming rate. Possible reasons include the loss of flower meadows, the crab-like varroa mite that feasts on their blood, climate change, and use of pesticides."" - BBC's Maddie Moate​ 2014</i></p>
<p>I have been recording music and touring internationally for more than 40 years and have garnered a faithful and growing fan base in 50 countries around the world. I am proud to collaborate with so many exceptionally talented artists on this project using spectacle and play to produce a cutting-edge show filled with technological delights to create an 'Awe' experience - proving art can change the world!</p>
<p><i>The awe experience takes us on a journey, It entices us into a mini revolution, an internal revolt that opens us. It evolves our perceptions, our beliefs and the way we relate to the world around us – without asking for permission. It is an experience that turns on a light inside us when we least expect it. </i></p>

<h3>Inspiration</h3>
<p>When I was 21 years old I had a dream.  In the dream, I’m standing at a stone balustrade in front of a French Chateau in the Hollywood hills; which, of course, you can do in the Hollywood hills, and you can do in a dream.</p>
<p>The sun had just set and I was gazing down over the city. I noticed to my amazement the city lights come on-line systematically in large sections across the valley. I had never seen that before.</p>
<p>It was the time of year when the sun goes down you feel the bite of the air on your skin and the clean smell of damp earth. In front of me off in the distance, I could see the silhouette of the Angeles Crest Mountain Range — a black sharp outline against a massive bandwidth of brilliant orange illuminating the sky where the sun had set. I had to look straight up into the night sky to see where it turned to turquoise blue and to see the first star. </p>
<p>This was epic!</p>
<p>I was fully immersed in the waves of beautiful feeling this stunning visual moment brought, when something caught my attention. I turned to look and behind me were two very tall narrow French doors, and inside was a full-blown Hollywood party, with people smoking and drinking and being all fabulous.</p>
<p>But I didn't want to go in. I just wanted to turn around and be back in the vibe of the epic moment. But when I did turn away something caught my eye, and I noticed, behind the far right door there was a woman -  floating a foot off the ground!! She had no clothes on, and no hair on her body. Strangely, her body was like a jellyfish… Now, don’t get me wrong, her anatomy was clearly like ours. Yet, parts of her body were transparent, and had the look and texture of a Box Jellyfish. In fact, I  would have to say her body’s opacity was a combination Box Jellyfish/Gecko.</p>
<p>What I mean was that her breasts and muscle pads were transparent like a Box Jellyfish and her torso had the opacity of a Gecko. Just like we can see its eggs inside a Gecko, I could see her ovaries and I could see her heart beating inside her chest. Her neck and arms and breast were clear like a jellyfish but the torso transparent like a gecko.</p>
<p>I became fascinated by every inch of her body. I noticed she had a blue caste to her body and I thought to myself, ""Oh it’s because our veins are blue.""</p>
<p>I could see her neck vein pulsing up and down, and as I watched closely I could see various systems moving inside her body. I became so wrapped up in her anatomy I forgot there was a person attached to this body, and when I finally did look into her eyes, I got freaked out.</p>
<p>She said, “Don’t be afraid!” But her lips didn’t move.</p>
<p>And I said, ‘Did you just talk to me inside my head?”</p>
<p>“When you reach a certain moment in your human development, you’ll no longer be afraid to allow people to know what you think or feel.”</p>
<p>I thought for a moment, ""That sounds right.""</p>
<p>Looking into her eyes I asked, “Who are you?""</p>
<p>She paused, and said, ""I’m your future self"",</p>
<p>and I woke up.</p>
<p>Meeting my future self all those years ago gave me a trajectory – a star on the distant horizon to point my compass toward. I have now shared this dream with many people in more than 20 countries around the world. I believe Mik Lavage's music created a portal for my future self to come through. The impact this story, and the new music from It’s All a Beautiful Noise has on people is really something special to experience. As part of ‘The Show’ I want to share my dream moment in a more dynamic and captivating way, by allowing my future self to come to life! I want to give my future self the opportunity to sing and talk directly to the audience, reflecting back to us what she thinks is happening on planet earth, and sharing her great belief in humanity’s capacity to evolve and meet the shifting dynamic of the natural world on planet Earth.</p>
<h3>Rewards</h3>
<p>I have many wonderful Rewards to entice you to pollinate It's All a Beautiful Noise and to signal your friends to do the same. I have been busy designing the merch for this show for the last couple of years, so I am really excited to finally share what's on offer here. I have everything from CDs to Concert Packages, Birthday Bundles, Songwriting Retreats, my Radical Alignment Retreats, Posters, Animal Chalkboards &amp; Whiteboards, T-Shirts and more.  Below are some large product photos of some of the things you can purchase as gifts for someone you love or just for yourself for this coming holiday season!</p>
<h3>Music</h3>
<p>The music for <a href=""http://tonichilds.com/release/its-all-a-beautiful-noise/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">It's All a Beautiful Noise</a> was written and produced in collaboration with Mik Lavage. Mik is a sound designer, noise maker extraordinaire, and AFI award nominee who creates music primarily for film, television and documentary. His vast and epic musical contributions inspired me to explore new possibilities vocally which led me into the territory of DubStep and Trip-Hop. I also wanted to create something unique for the CD cover, and I thought it would be cool to design a popup cover to interface with six Augmented Reality Animations that Tigrelab are creating specifically for this show.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I cannot foresee any challenges to producing all aspects of this ground-breaking, awe inspiring and educational show, or in fulfilling the Rewards I've listed in this campaign, other than, of course, failing to make my 350k goal. All of the collaborators on this project are top professionals in their respective fields, with excellent production credentials. The manufacturers producing my rewards also have a proven reputation for delivering quality products. With the combined expertise of these professionals, plus my success as a producer and performer over many years in the music and arts industry, I am fully confident I will reach my projected goal.</p>
<h3>Share what qualifies you to overcome these hurdles.</h3>
<p>I launched a Kickstarter campaign in 2013 and raised $111K, just over my target amount. In 2013, 699 individuals pledged to my Kickstarter to put it over the line. That was an average spend of $159 per person. To reach my present 350K target I will need approximately 2,202 individuals to buy-in at the same average. I believe this is absolutely possible given the number of fans and friends I have on Facebook and other social media sites, plus my always growing mailing list of 45,000. This was my very first crowd-funding campaign, and I learned a lot from that experience.</p>
<p>There were many issues I had to overcome, such as organizing the mailing list and finding the right fulfillment warehouses in China and the US. We recently linked our shop to our fulfillments centre warehouses. I am bringing all I learned to this campaign. Specifically, I am creating a video explaining the challenges of the first campaign and how I will avoid these issues this time around. This will give new, and past supporters, the chance to understand more fully the process of fulfillment, the processes I've put in place in order to make reward fulfillment easier, and where we are at presently with Citizens of the Planet.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

Aloha... my name is Toni Childs, I am an Emmy Winner and three time Grammy nominated recording artist, installation artist, environmental activist and yoga teacher. In a nut shell, I am an impact artist, and I have developed a new music driven 3D Mapping Concert Experience - 'It's All a Beautiful Noise'. To listen to my new music click here. 
This is two hours of music and off-the-hook 3D mapping animations by Barcelona based Tigrelab. My show is designed to inspire a ground swell of support for our littlest angels - the Bees and other Pollinators who are facing collapse. (Click on the video below to watch Tigrelab's Projection Reel. This will give an idea of the quality and scope of their work.)

 
My show is unique on a few fronts, most notable is that it was designed to keep audiences engaged for up to five months - before, during and after the show by using life size Visy Recycled paper animal installations that are installed three months BEFORE the show comes to town, and six simple white paper hats of pollinators with addressable LED lights that are given to audience members at the show. And guess what? I get to control lights in the hats from the stage - fun fun fun!!

Now the really cool part for me is that each hat is connected to a different environmental organization with the URL of the organization on the underside of the hat. Each organization is asked to take the audience member on a journey AFTER the concert- a treasure hunt so to speak - to experience five online hero moments that end asking the audience member to send their hat to a yet to be specified physical location where all the hats become part of a large public installation and a beautiful tremendous voice for our pollinators! I am presently in talking with Green Peace, World Wild Life Fund, ICUN Red List and NGOs local to different countries we will be touring.
Bee populations collapsed 41% in the US last year... !! To give these beautiful creatures a voice I have created a High-Tech inspirational interactive playdate with an environmental message.  The production will travel to regional areas of the US, Canada, Australia and Europe inspiring people to stop buying chemicals and the chemical laden products that are contributing to the collapse of our littlest angels our pollinators.
The theme for my show is ""We are all pollinators, what we buy we grow!"" 
We are actually corporate farmers... if we don't buy it, it won't grow!
“as Interaction with social media and its tools become more and more sophisticated so to has the expectation of audiences for more than just a music experience. People are seeking to belong, to engage, and participate in change.” - MIT Press




 
What We Need...
My goal is to raise 350K for all the elements that make up the show in this crowd-funding campaign:

The design, fabrication and build of three popup sets for my shows in the US, Europe and Australia. (I am fabricating three sets in three different countries to reduce international shipping costs to our touring company.);
Two hours of 3D animation mixed with live action footage;
An exoskeletal suit that brings the show together ;
Four weeks with a Dramaturge to really nut-out the flow of the show and tighten the storytelling elements; 
And a full four weeks of production rehearsals in Barcelona bringing all the elements together: the music, the set, 3D animations, lights, sound and storytelling.

Your buy-in means we can bring contemporary art with an environmental message to cities and regional areas. This will give us a shot at changing some minds about the chemicals people use in areas where environmental activism is usually a dirty word. 
""Where would we be without bees? As far as important species go, they are top of the list. They are critical pollinators: they pollinate 70 of the around 100 crop species that feed 90% of the world. Honey bees are responsible for $30 billion a year in crops.
That’s only the start. We may lose all the plants that bees pollinate, all of the animals that eat those plants and so on up the food chain. Which means a world without bees could struggle to sustain the global human population of 7 billion. Our supermarkets would have half the amount of fruit and vegetables.
It gets worse. We are losing bees at an alarming rate. Possible reasons include the loss of flower meadows, the crab-like varroa mite that feasts on their blood, climate change, and use of pesticides."" - BBC's Maddie Moate​ 2014
I have been recording music and touring internationally for more than 40 years and have garnered a faithful and growing fan base in 50 countries around the world. I am proud to collaborate with so many exceptionally talented artists on this project using spectacle and play to produce a cutting-edge show filled with technological delights to create an 'Awe' experience - proving art can change the world!
The awe experience takes us on a journey, It entices us into a mini revolution, an internal revolt that opens us. It evolves our perceptions, our beliefs and the way we relate to the world around us – without asking for permission. It is an experience that turns on a light inside us when we least expect it. 

Inspiration
When I was 21 years old I had a dream.  In the dream, I’m standing at a stone balustrade in front of a French Chateau in the Hollywood hills; which, of course, you can do in the Hollywood hills, and you can do in a dream.
The sun had just set and I was gazing down over the city. I noticed to my amazement the city lights come on-line systematically in large sections across the valley. I had never seen that before.
It was the time of year when the sun goes down you feel the bite of the air on your skin and the clean smell of damp earth. In front of me off in the distance, I could see the silhouette of the Angeles Crest Mountain Range — a black sharp outline against a massive bandwidth of brilliant orange illuminating the sky where the sun had set. I had to look straight up into the night sky to see where it turned to turquoise blue and to see the first star. 
This was epic!
I was fully immersed in the waves of beautiful feeling this stunning visual moment brought, when something caught my attention. I turned to look and behind me were two very tall narrow French doors, and inside was a full-blown Hollywood party, with people smoking and drinking and being all fabulous.
But I didn't want to go in. I just wanted to turn around and be back in the vibe of the epic moment. But when I did turn away something caught my eye, and I noticed, behind the far right door there was a woman -  floating a foot off the ground!! She had no clothes on, and no hair on her body. Strangely, her body was like a jellyfish… Now, don’t get me wrong, her anatomy was clearly like ours. Yet, parts of her body were transparent, and had the look and texture of a Box Jellyfish. In fact, I  would have to say her body’s opacity was a combination Box Jellyfish/Gecko.
What I mean was that her breasts and muscle pads were transparent like a Box Jellyfish and her torso had the opacity of a Gecko. Just like we can see its eggs inside a Gecko, I could see her ovaries and I could see her heart beating inside her chest. Her neck and arms and breast were clear like a jellyfish but the torso transparent like a gecko.
I became fascinated by every inch of her body. I noticed she had a blue caste to her body and I thought to myself, ""Oh it’s because our veins are blue.""
I could see her neck vein pulsing up and down, and as I watched closely I could see various systems moving inside her body. I became so wrapped up in her anatomy I forgot there was a person attached to this body, and when I finally did look into her eyes, I got freaked out.
She said, “Don’t be afraid!” But her lips didn’t move.
And I said, ‘Did you just talk to me inside my head?”
“When you reach a certain moment in your human development, you’ll no longer be afraid to allow people to know what you think or feel.”
I thought for a moment, ""That sounds right.""
Looking into her eyes I asked, “Who are you?""
She paused, and said, ""I’m your future self"",
and I woke up.
Meeting my future self all those years ago gave me a trajectory – a star on the distant horizon to point my compass toward. I have now shared this dream with many people in more than 20 countries around the world. I believe Mik Lavage's music created a portal for my future self to come through. The impact this story, and the new music from It’s All a Beautiful Noise has on people is really something special to experience. As part of ‘The Show’ I want to share my dream moment in a more dynamic and captivating way, by allowing my future self to come to life! I want to give my future self the opportunity to sing and talk directly to the audience, reflecting back to us what she thinks is happening on planet earth, and sharing her great belief in humanity’s capacity to evolve and meet the shifting dynamic of the natural world on planet Earth.
Rewards
I have many wonderful Rewards to entice you to pollinate It's All a Beautiful Noise and to signal your friends to do the same. I have been busy designing the merch for this show for the last couple of years, so I am really excited to finally share what's on offer here. I have everything from CDs to Concert Packages, Birthday Bundles, Songwriting Retreats, my Radical Alignment Retreats, Posters, Animal Chalkboards & Whiteboards, T-Shirts and more.  Below are some large product photos of some of the things you can purchase as gifts for someone you love or just for yourself for this coming holiday season!
Music
The music for It's All a Beautiful Noise was written and produced in collaboration with Mik Lavage. Mik is a sound designer, noise maker extraordinaire, and AFI award nominee who creates music primarily for film, television and documentary. His vast and epic musical contributions inspired me to explore new possibilities vocally which led me into the territory of DubStep and Trip-Hop. I also wanted to create something unique for the CD cover, and I thought it would be cool to design a popup cover to interface with six Augmented Reality Animations that Tigrelab are creating specifically for this show. If you've yet to hear about augmented reality click on the link and see what it's all about. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH_LfXnklRw

<p>It's me, Mil. The seven year old dreamer that once screamed and cried and kicked and spit people in the face in order to avoid singing in front of crowds has now written a song and is oddly proud and in love with it. This would be an honor and a lifelong dream of mine to share with all of you. The song called ""MoVE"" is written and performed by yours truly. The production is ready to, well, move. After 100 rough drafts on voice notes I realized it won't work this way. It needs studio time, producers, and a music video to follow... and it ain't even close to free. So I'll need your help. Anything goes such a long way, even a share of this page on your social sites will cause a ripple that can make waves. It takes an army to make a single three minutes of music come to life and I have faith we can make it happen.  I can't wait to share the final product with you all so you can blast it in your car or maybe at a bar. You can blast it in a club or bathing in a tub. You can blast it here, there...you see where I'm going with this, right? Anyhow, this one comes from the heart and I hope you all have as much fun listening as I will creating. </p>

<h2>
</h2>
<p>Dear AHMIR-ica.. yes, that's you, our devoted and loyal fanbase from ALL over the world.  You may likely know us from our YouTube covers and fell in love with how we breathed new life into your favorite songs. You always knew it was an AHMIR cover when you heard our signature group harmonies and lush vocals that just made your heart melt every time :)  We uploaded our first cover in 2008 and because of each of you, we are still here in 2016... 200+ videos and almost 100 million views later. We've performed all over the country, got a record deal, been featured in magazines, played on the radio, had our albums in stores in Japan, even been on TV a few times.  We've been privileged enough to also use our platform to help bring awareness and raise money for some awesome charities.  It's truly been an incredible ride so far and we can only thank you for making it possible. <br/></p>
<p>In all honesty, we're not quite sure where this ride will take us or when it will end, but we do know that before all is said and done we wanted to make a new album of all original R&amp;B music.  An album that is AHMIR at its core. An album that is raw, emotional, soulful and most importantly written by us as we've experienced life, love, lust, and loss.  Some of you may know we released our first original R&amp;B album called ""The Gift"" back in 2006.  We've lived a lot since then and as you can imagine, 10 years later we have a lot to say. <br/></p>
<p>For the past year, we've been secretly recording songs for this new album and it's almost done and we must say it's truly going to be a collection of songs that you'll cherish for a lifetime.  Our dream is to have this album heard by everyone possible, talked about by everyone possible, and most of all enjoyed by everyone possible.  Writing and recording the songs is only part of the process and now this next part is why we're launching this campaign. <br/></p>
<p>We no longer have the resources of a record label, but we're confident we can do something truly special with your help. We want to have the best possible sound engineers to make sure the songs sound amazing for you. We want to put out the best and most beautiful visuals for you. We want to put together the best team of people to give us the best chance at showcasing these songs so you can maybe see us on TV again, hear us on the radio, or even perform near YOU. We want OUR success to be YOUR success. As this may be our last original album, we would love nothing more than for you to lend us a hand to take us through this monumental part of our journey. <br/></p>
<p>Much luv ...KC, Sing-Sing, Big Mike &amp; Mr. Jones<br/></p>

</div></div>","Our Letter To YOU.


Dear AHMIR-ica.. yes, that's you, our devoted and loyal fanbase from ALL over the world.  You may likely know us from our YouTube covers and fell in love with how we breathed new life into your favorite songs. You always knew it was an AHMIR cover when you heard our signature group harmonies and lush vocals that just made your heart melt every time :)  We uploaded our first cover in 2008 and because of each of you, we are still here in 2016... 200+ videos and almost 100 million views later. We've performed all over the country, got a record deal, been featured in magazines, played on the radio, had our albums in stores in Japan, even been on TV a few times.  We've been privileged enough to also use our platform to help bring awareness and raise money for some awesome charities.  It's truly been an incredible ride so far and we can only thank you for making it possible. 
In all honesty, we're not quite sure where this ride will take us or when it will end, but we do know that before all is said and done we wanted to make a new album of all original R&B music.  An album that is AHMIR at its core. An album that is raw, emotional, soulful and most importantly written by us as we've experienced life, love, lust, and loss.  Some of you may know we released our first original R&B album called ""The Gift"" back in 2006.  We've lived a lot since then and as you can imagine, 10 years later we have a lot to say. 
For the past year, we've been secretly recording songs for this new album and it's almost done and we must say it's truly going to be a collection of songs that you'll cherish for a lifetime.  Our dream is to have this album heard by everyone possible, talked about by everyone possible, and most of all enjoyed by everyone possible.  Writing and recording the songs is only part of the process and now this next part is why we're launching this campaign. 
We no longer have the resources of a record label, but we're confident we can do something truly special with your help. We want to have the best possible sound engineers to make sure the songs sound amazing for you. We want to put out the best and most beautiful visuals for you. We want to put together the best team of people to give us the best chance at showcasing these songs so you can maybe see us on TV again, hear us on the radio, or even perform near YOU. We want OUR success to be YOUR success. As this may be our last original album, we would love nothing more than for you to lend us a hand to take us through this monumental part of our journey. 
Much luv ...KC, Sing-Sing, Big Mike & Mr. Jones

<p><b>CHALLENGES</b></p>
<p>We would not have gotten so far if we wouldn’t had taken into
account certain risks. In this campaign the most eminent risk is the fact that
we might not raise the entire amount of 4000 $ that we need for the production
of the music compilation. Therefore, we present you three scenarios of our next
steps in case we do not reach  campaign's goal in order to ensure you that the
compilation will still be produced, one way or another.</p>
<p><i>Scenario 1</i></p>
<p>If we raise less than 900 $ then we will distribute only a
digital version of the compilation album with 9 songs on it.</p>
<p><i>Scenario 2</i></p>
<p>If we manage to raise 1000 $ then we will produce 500 CDs with 9
songs on them.</p>
<p><i>Scenario 3</i></p>
<p>If we manage to raise more than 1000 we complete the 500 CDs
production (9 songs) with additional songs proportionally to the amount raised.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472476115/12973037_1732396253668089_6818009442872145534_o_pi3dgj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>IMPACT</b></p>

put together workshops with music industry professionals in order to improve
the learning outcomes of these emerging artists. We are also constantly working
on facilitating their access to stages all over Moldova at the same time
bringing along fresh alternative music to the public. Once the project
became a success, we decided to go further and register it as a non-profit
organization with the main focus on the development of alternative music in
Moldova. Moreover, we do our best to bring music closer to
youngsters that are in difficulties, such as the teenagers from boarding schools
or those from juvenile prison. </span></p><br/><p></p><p>**************************** ROMÂNĂ **********************************</p><p><i>                   POT este un proiect muzical din Republica Moldova, care a început în 2014, pentru a ajuta și a încuraja trupele tinere să-și aducă muzica în fața unui public mai larg.</i></p><p>Acesta acționează ca o platformă de decolare oferind acces artiștilor începători la scene, cunoștințe din industria muzicală și o rețea de oportunități cu profesioniștii din domeniu.

Aceasta va fi o oportunitate fantastică de a promova muzica alternativă moldovenească dincolo de hotarele țării noastre. Prin comercializarea albumului dorim să asigurăm continuitatea următoarelor ediții ale compilației.</span><br/></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">În Moldova producția unei piese costă în jur de 330 $, ceea ce este mai mult decât salariul mediu lunar, care poate fi rotungit la 200 $. Prin urmare, o astfel de compilație muzicală va oferi o șansă unică pentru 15 trupe începătoare de a-și demonstra talentul și rezultatul muncii lor. A avea un CD care include o piesă proprie este o mare realizare pentru orice tânăr artist și o șansă pentru un început grozav.

Această sumă include producția a încă 6 piese, ceea ce echivalează cu 20 de zile de muncă de studio pentru înregistrare. Pe lîngă aceasta, vom avea nevoie de mixing și mastering pentru toate piesele. Și nu în ultimul rând. mai avem cheltuieli de design și ambalare.

account certain risks. In this campaign the most eminent risk is the fact that
we might not raise the entire amount of 4000 $ that we need for the production
of the music compilation. Therefore, we present you three scenarios of our next
steps in case we do not reach  campaign's goal in order to ensure you that the
compilation will still be produced, one way or another.
Scenario 1
If we raise less than 900 $ then we will distribute only a
digital version of the compilation album with 9 songs on it.
Scenario 2
If we manage to raise 1000 $ then we will produce 500 CDs with 9
songs on them.
Scenario 3
If we manage to raise more than 1000 we complete the 500 CDs
production (9 songs) with additional songs proportionally to the amount raised.IMPACT
Your donation will make a difference, no matter
the size, because it will increase our chances of producing the first Moldovan
Alternative Music Compilation. And last, but not least, it will help us
promote the image of young Moldovan musicians in the international artistic
community. 
All in all, we strongly feel that our investment in the future
of young aspiring musicians will be worthwhile. We hope that your support
towards the production of the first POT Music Album will take this
initiative to the next level. 
Empower young Moldovan artists with a bright future by making a
contribution!A few more words about POT Music as an organization. Through our
program we have created a community of young
musicians who are determined to better their performing skills. We have
put together workshops with music industry professionals in order to improve
the learning outcomes of these emerging artists. We are also constantly working
on facilitating their access to stages all over Moldova at the same time
bringing along fresh alternative music to the public. Once the project
became a success, we decided to go further and register it as a non-profit
organization with the main focus on the development of alternative music in
Moldova. Moreover, we do our best to bring music closer to
youngsters that are in difficulties, such as the teenagers from boarding schools
or those from juvenile prison. **************************** ROMÂNĂ **********************************                   POT este un proiect muzical din Republica Moldova, care a început în 2014, pentru a ajuta și a încuraja trupele tinere să-și aducă muzica în fața unui public mai larg.Acesta acționează ca o platformă de decolare oferind acces artiștilor începători la scene, cunoștințe din industria muzicală și o rețea de oportunități cu profesioniștii din domeniu. De la bun început, 25 de trupe au avut posibilitatea de a evolua pe o scenă vie și să-și arate talentele lor în cadrul Concursului POT Music.2016 este un an interesant pentru că ne-am propus să producem prima Compilație de Muzică Alternativă din Moldova, care va include piesele mai multor trupe tinere ce sunt la început de cale. Aceasta va fi o oportunitate fantastică de a promova muzica alternativă moldovenească dincolo de hotarele țării noastre. Prin comercializarea albumului dorim să asigurăm continuitatea următoarelor ediții ale compilației.În Moldova producția unei piese costă în jur de 330 $, ceea ce este mai mult decât salariul mediu lunar, care poate fi rotungit la 200 $. Prin urmare, o astfel de compilație muzicală va oferi o șansă unică pentru 15 trupe începătoare de a-și demonstra talentul și rezultatul muncii lor. A avea un CD care include o piesă proprie este o mare realizare pentru orice tânăr artist și o șansă pentru un început grozav. Cu atât mai mult dacă vii într-o țară în care industria muzicală este subdezvolată și ai oportunități limitate.Noi avem acest vis de a vedea trupele POT Music pe arena internațională cântând la deschiderea unui concert a unor trupe precum Radiohead, Hurts, Red Hot Chili Pepper, Muse sau Arctic Monkeys. 
Iar primul pas spre realizarea acestui vis este promovarea muzicii alternative din Moldova prin intermediul unei compilații. Bugetul total pentru realizarea albumului se ridică la 7600 USD și include costurile de producție pentru o compilație de 15 piese și producerea a 500 de exemplare (CD-uri). Până în prezent, am reușit să strîngem cu forțele proprii 3600 USD pentru producția a 9 piese. Iar acum avem nevoie de suportul tău pentru a colecta cei 4000$ adiționali de care avem nevoie pentru a face această compilație o realitate! Această sumă include producția a încă 6 piese, ceea ce echivalează cu 20 de zile de muncă de studio pentru înregistrare. Pe lîngă aceasta, vom avea nevoie de mixing și mastering pentru toate piesele. Și nu în ultimul rând. mai avem cheltuieli de design și ambalare. Ne propunem să înregistrăm melodiile în cel mai bun studio din Moldova -  Polidisc Records, iar mixul și masteringul urmează să fie realizate de către NMP Studios din Londra. Și sigur că vechiul și dragul nostru prieten Imago va crea design-ul copertei pentru album. Ambele studiouri sprijină inițiativa noastră oferindu-ne prețuri extrem de generoase pentru munca lor de înaltă calitate, prin urmare micșorând costurile noastre considerabil!PROVOCĂRICu siguranță nu am fi ajuns atât de departe dacă nu am fi luat în considerație anumite riscuri. În această campanie riscul cel mai eminent este faptul că s-ar putea să nu reușim să colectăm întreaga sumă de 4000 $ de care avem nevoie pentru producerea compilației muzicale. Prin urmare, vă prezentăm trei scenarii a ceea ce urmează să facem în cazul în care nu ne vom atingem obiectivul campaniei.Scenariul 1Dacă vom colecta mai puțin de 900 $, atunci vom distribui doar versiunea digitală a albumului și va cuprinde 9 piese.Scenariul 2Dacă vom reuși să adunăm 1000 $, atunci vom produce 500 de CD-uri având 9 piese înregistrate.Scenariul 3Dacă vom reuși să colectăm mai mult de 1000 $, vom completa producția a 500 de CD-uri (9 piese), cu cântece adiționale proporțional cu sumei colectate.IMPACTDonația ta contează, indiferent de mărimea acesteia, deoarece ea va crește șansele noastre de a produce prima Compilație de Muzică Alternativă din Moldova și de a promova imaginea tinerilor muzicieni moldoveni în comunitatea artistică internațională.Într-un final, suntem ferm convinși că investiția noastră în viitorul tinerilor muzicieni se merită pe deplin. Sperăm că sprijinul tău pentru producerea primului album POT Music va aduce această inițiativă la un nou nivel.
Încurajează tinerii artiști moldoveni cu o contribuție și oferă-le un viitor strălucit!
***
Mai multe despre POT Music ca și organizație. Noi am reușit să creăm o comunitate de tineri muzicieni care sunt hotărâți să-și îmbunătățească abilitățile lor de performanță. Pe lângă aceasta, am organizat o serie de ateliere cu profesioniștii din industria muzicală, cu scopul de a le oferi o nouă experiență practică de învățare. Totodată, continuăm să lucrăm la facilitarea accesului acestor trupe la scenele din toată țara, aducând în același timp publicului larg muzică alternativă nouă.În momentul în care proiectul a devenit un succes, am decis că trebuie să mergem mai departe și să creăm o organizație non-profit, cu accent pe dezvoltarea muzicii alternative din Moldova. Mai mult decât atât, încercăm să aducem muzica mai aproape de tinerii care sunt în dificultate, cum ar fi adolescenții din școlile-internat sau cei din închisoarea pentru minori. Astfel, în 2015 și 2016 am pornit la drum spre școala internat din comuna Popeasca și spre închisoarea pentru minori din Goian cu cîteva trupe din POT, unde le-am organizat cîte un mic concert live.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Offer stipends to local artists.</strong> We offer our performing artists' stipends to participate in our festival. Help us maintain this program and add a new initiative that will support at least one art installation by an individual or group per month.</p>
<p><strong>Support our Artrepreneurship program. </strong>This year, we launched our Artrepreneurship program in partnership with <a href=""http://thegreenleef.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Green Leef</a> and offered Oakland artisan vendors a low-cost 10-week business course.

<p><strong>Hire and retain program staff. </strong>In order for us to do all of the above, we need to hire the staff who will help us with these three tasks: aid and support our participating artisans and artists, run new program initiatives like the Artrepreneurship program, and to cultivate new and impactful partnerships with other Oakland arts organizations.</p>
<p><strong>Keep our event free and vendor fees low.</strong> Finally, we want to keep our event free to the public all while retaining low vendor fees for the artisan community. </p>

Oakland First Fridays has grown from a small one-block street fair to a nationally known force that attracts tens of thousands of Bay Area residents each month to the KONO (Koreatown Northgate) arts district.Oakland First Fridays runs the festival outdoors in conjunction with Art Murmur's monthly gallery openings, blocking off five city blocks on Telegraph to host nearly 100 arts, artisan, and food vendors for nominal vendor fees.
In addition, our staff curates two stages and up to five performance areas, providing a platform and stipends to dozens of emerging Bay Area performing artists each month. 
In 2013, the festival grew larger than the community of artists who were running it could support, and the nonprofit business district successfully took over coordinating the festival and has done so for the past three years.
Now we need your help to grow and improve our festival.
The annual cost to run our event is nearing $250,000, which we are currently raising from gate donations, sponsorships, and vendor fees. But this does not include the cost of the additional staff and equipment we need to continue to run our event and deepen our impact.   
This fundraiser will allow us to buy much needed equipment for our local performing arts program, and enable us to hire and retain program staff for rest of  2016 through 2017. All while keeping our event free to the public and affordable for our artisan vendors.
Your support will not only help Oakland First Fridays this year, but for years to come. You will truly brighten our future.

Our Bright Future & Yours 
What we need to build our brighter future! Your donation will go directly to helping us:
Purchase needed stage and sound equipment. We offer a platform to over 100 local up-and-coming performing artists each year. In order to offer a better experience for both our emerging artists and Oakland First Fridays audience, we need to replace our aging sound and stage equipment.
Offer stipends to local artists. We offer our performing artists' stipends to participate in our festival. Help us maintain this program and add a new initiative that will support at least one art installation by an individual or group per month.
Support our Artrepreneurship program. This year, we launched our Artrepreneurship program in partnership with Green Leef and offered Oakland artisan vendors a low-cost 10-week business course. We are continuing this program in 2017, and will be adding free monthly courses for artisans participating in our festival.
Hire and retain program staff. In order for us to do all of the above, we need to hire the staff who will help us with these three tasks: aid and support our participating artisans and artists, run new program initiatives like the Artrepreneurship program, and to cultivate new and impactful partnerships with other Oakland arts organizations.
Keep our event free and vendor fees low. Finally, we want to keep our event free to the public all while retaining low vendor fees for the artisan community. 

What we will do to brighten your future! 

For your donation, you will receive some pretty rad limited-edition perks (listed to your right), such as:A long-lasting, UV-coated 3"" by 3"" I [heart] Oakland First Fridays Sticker

We are bringing in some top industry experts to bring this idea to fruition - including a sound engineer who worked on the last 3 James Bond soundtracks.
   What We Need & What You Get

We need the funding to cover the costs of the project.  To produce the highest professional output we can, the costs are large.We also want to make sure the stream and product is guaranteed.What is going to come from this project:  The show will be available as a stream for just over 24 hours from 1900 28th November to 2359 29th November 2016.  You will be able to start watching the stream (from the start of the show) at any point in that period. In addition, available in January 2017 will be a DVD and CDs of the show.  The DVDs will contain all the individual tracks performed, but not the compere spots and not the James Bond Radio presentation - for these you will need to watch the live show. We have a variety of perks available, including access to the stream (you will need to pay to get an access code), copies of the DVD/CD and other great options too.



    Risks & Challenges  To guarantee the streams (to ensure a good connection), and make sure our fans around the World can see the show, we are uploading and streaming the show for just over 24 hours after the show.  No matter where you are in the World, you will be able to begin the show and watch it as live, within that period.We very much want to give the feel of the live show - which is why we are only offering it in this method in this time period, after that, an edited down DVD will be available.

<p><strong>More about the project:</strong></p>
<p>No-land Bands is a series of four concerts of improvised music. Each event will be dedicated to stories of one city in the Middle East. There will be at least two performers with Middle Eastern instruments who are familiar with the music of the area and will define the main theme of the performance. The themes will be free melodic interpretations of known traditional motifs or tunes from that area.  </p>
<p>The musical experience will be accompanied by a visual journey as well. We will be working with visual artists to produce video art installation which will be projected on a screen during the show. The video art will be inspired by the city that will be be presented in the Middle East. Through this setting, a triangular relationship between audience, musicians and places is being shaped. The musical and visual experience will literally put the audience in those places, transforming  their understanding of a specific geographical location. These short journeys will take away all the abstraction and numbness of what we hear on everyday news , and replace it with a humane and tangible experience.</p> <p><strong>Who I am:</strong></p>
<p>I am an architect and a part-time musician interested in community based projects. Taking into account the recent events in Syria, as well as ongoing struggle of refugees all over the world, I understand that it is important to bring awareness towards these issues. This understanding inspired me to create a project that would unite like-minded musicians towards a noble goal. Being originally from Iran, I know how important it is to promote intercultural understanding.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get:</strong></p>
<p>A major portion of funding for this project will be dedicated to creative expenses, since it will be crucial that the collaborating artists and musicians are well compensated and able to produce their best work. We are hopeful that the outcome of this project will be a valuable asset in the cultural landscape of our era.</p>
<p>The outcome though, will not be limited  to a series of live performances. Therefore the quality of production and documentation of the work is quite important. Our goal is to have an impact on as large an audience as possible, making investment in publicity materials and the distribution of video and audio recordings is vital to the success of the project.</p>
<p>The minimum basic costs of each event will be approximately $2,500 which includes musicians’ fees, video art production and video and audio recording of the event.</p>
<p>If we go beyond our campaign goal, we will be producing an album from the selected musics produced during the entire length of the project. The cost of the album production will be approximately $2,500. Our supporters will receive a free copy of the album as soon as it is published.</p>
<p>Please check out our perks section and see what you get from us for your contribution.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact:</strong></p>
<p>One of the key aspects of this project is using music as a metaphor to reveal the possibility of peaceful dialogue between different nations and cultures. Music, as a universal language, has no borders, yet different music can resonate together. As one of the most important outcome of this project, at least 4 hours of original music will be produced and distributed, which can make an effective impact on the perspective of people and politicians dealing with some of the world’s current crisis.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help:</strong></p>
<p>- Please share this campaign with your network of friends, family and coworkers.</p>
<p>- If you are a musician or artist and you would like to contribute to this project, we definitely welcome you! Please send us an email and tell us how you would like to contribute.</p> <p>- If you know any organization or institute which might be interested in sponsoring or supporting this project please let us know.</p> <p>- If you know any venue, rehearsal space or recording studio that might be willing to support this project or you can facilitate a relationship with them, please share it with us.</p>

<h3>Read more about my campaign:</h3>
<ul>
<li>My name is Ashton York and I was born and raised here in Northern California. I've been surrounded by music my whole life. I began writing songs and playing different instruments by the time I was 11, and now at 22, I still have the same passion for playing as I always have.</li>
<li>This EP is made up of my strongest batch of songs yet, focusing on themes like friendship, family, faith/doubt, and life as a young adult. All of my favorite records are the ones in which the artist invites the listener into something that feels real. ""You Are My Sanity"" is an honest reflection of my story, and is something I'm confident many people will relate to. These songs are 100% me, and I couldn't be happier with them.</li>
<li>If you contribute, you're contributing to my future in music. This EP will be a giant stepping stone and tool in order to pursue a career in music.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>Here's why my EP is going to cost $8,000. A large portion of the funds are going towards studio time and hiring studio musicians. Five full days (10 hours) in the studio will cost on average (for audio engineer, musicians, recording studio fee) approximately $800, split between two studios. This recording process alone will cost $4,000. Then the mixing process will cost roughly $3,500 altogether for 7 songs. This is adds up to $7,500 total, which doesn't cover mastering costs. </li>
<li>If I make my $8,000 goal, every contributor will receive a free pre-download of the final product upon completion. The point of this campaign is to get some great music out for the world to hear. I am more than happy to give you the EP for free and in advance of the release date if you contribute. Of course, every contributor will receive a proper thank you whether or not I make my goal. </li>
<li>If we raise $10,000, I will be able to include a song that didn't quite make the cut for my $8,000 minimum. It's called ""Anymore"" and I'm crazy about it. If we raise $15,000, I will be able to invest in artwork and hard copies of the album. Physical CD's are always a plus, and I would include a really beautiful lyric booklet, something I've dreamed of for a long time.</li>
<li>If we do not make all $8,000 within the 30 days alotted, I will still be able to get started on the EP and book some studio time, which would still be incredibly helpful.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Honestly, the only thing that has prohibited me from making this album sooner, is lack of funds. I have been supporting myself completely since the age of 18. I work really hard, but on top of the cost of living, this project would take a long time to complete without your support.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>The best support possible, on top of contributing, is word of mouth! It would be so helpful if you participated with me in sharing and talking to other people about my project. Even if you don't contribute, spreading the word with family and friends would mean the world to me.</li>
<li>Though it might not be as effective as word of mouth, sharing this on social media is another HUGE help. I appreciate each and every effort to get the word out. Thank you again for your support!</li>

What We Need & What You Get

 Break it down for folks in more detail:  The goal is set at £1000 - This is to cover the pressing of the vinyl and to ensure that the compilation is the quality it deserves. As well as the compilation there is a number of other items in the Mai 68s Archive available including several unique live sets which are also available.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Welcome to my page! I'm Mikelangelo, but you can call me Mike (since we're friends now).  I'm an LA native at heart; my love for music grew in parallel with my struggles in South Central LA throughout the early 90's.  I define myself as an artist, songwriter, and engineer. I've been the in-house engineer for Kamaiyah (aka., 4Hunnid's and YG's first lady) since 2017 working directly for Universal Music Group / Interscope Records. Admittedly, I've been crafting my own music over the last few years in stealth mode, but was always scared to release it (until now). Nonetheless, I'm really looking forward to finally being able to share my songs and feelings with all of you special contributors. </p></li>
<li><p>To no surprise, my uphill journey led me to the studio, where I often found refuge and appreciation for my internal struggles through singing and engineering beats. I was fortunate enough to surround myself with some of the leading icons of our time. Not long after my obsession with mastering music turned into making music of my own, when I found myself working alongside icons Kamaiyah, YG, Hitboy, 808 Mafia, and Pierre Bourne, who ultimately helped me found my voice and new direction. </p></li>
<li><p>Fans have respectfully compared my music to the likes of Kid Cudi, Ginuwine, Drake, and Kendrick Lamar (in case your already a fan).  I'm known by the fans for flowy sounds, warm lyrics, and soulful pitch. What I enjoy most is capturing the love and kindness R&amp;B was always intended to bring in an age where there is too much division among each other. </p></li>
<li><p>This campaign is for my debut music video ""Used To"", and this project is important to me because I want the world to experience more love and kindness. I think it's time we share more soul, less divisiveness, more love, and less hatred. Simple as that.</p></li>

</ul></div>","Short Summary

Welcome to my page! I'm Mikelangelo, but you can call me Mike (since we're friends now).  I'm an LA native at heart; my love for music grew in parallel with my struggles in South Central LA throughout the early 90's.  I define myself as an artist, songwriter, and engineer. I've been the in-house engineer for Kamaiyah (aka., 4Hunnid's and YG's first lady) since 2017 working directly for Universal Music Group / Interscope Records. Admittedly, I've been crafting my own music over the last few years in stealth mode, but was always scared to release it (until now). Nonetheless, I'm really looking forward to finally being able to share my songs and feelings with all of you special contributors. 
To no surprise, my uphill journey led me to the studio, where I often found refuge and appreciation for my internal struggles through singing and engineering beats. I was fortunate enough to surround myself with some of the leading icons of our time. Not long after my obsession with mastering music turned into making music of my own, when I found myself working alongside icons Kamaiyah, YG, Hitboy, 808 Mafia, and Pierre Bourne, who ultimately helped me found my voice and new direction. 
Fans have respectfully compared my music to the likes of Kid Cudi, Ginuwine, Drake, and Kendrick Lamar (in case your already a fan).  I'm known by the fans for flowy sounds, warm lyrics, and soulful pitch. What I enjoy most is capturing the love and kindness R&B was always intended to bring in an age where there is too much division among each other. 
This campaign is for my debut music video ""Used To"", and this project is important to me because I want the world to experience more love and kindness. I think it's time we share more soul, less divisiveness, more love, and less hatred. Simple as that.

What We Need & What You Get

We're looking for a minimum of $3,500, and 100% of the proceeds whether the goal is met or not will go directly towards the music video production. We're working with a trusted industry-recognized production crew.

Our production team: AJ Favicchio & Miles Cable 
Projects include: Jaden Smith - Fallen, Billy Ellish - Bellyache, Bea Miller - To The Grave

Here's how the costs estimated break down for the music video to be a success: 
$2k+ production (lenses, lights, site location cost, etc.)
$1k directing fee
$500 edit
$500 styling  


What you will receive in return, other than being my day 1's, is an exclusive invitation to my video launch party, contributor video credits, signed merchandise, and special shout-outs across social media!

<h3>BIO</h3>
<p>•Nikki Allen is a singer/songwriter/musician whose artistic style crosses many genres, from R&amp;B, Pop, Hip/Hop to Contemporary Jazz.  Her five octave vocal range and sultry voice is not only unique and soothing, but satisfying to the soul.</p>
<p>•Straight Outta Chicago, Nikki landed in LA and began immediately working her talents, touring and performing with mainstream artists like Jon B., and working with artists like Angie Stone, and Mary J. Blige just to name a few.  Nikki later toured Asia on her own accord, not only as a singer but as a musician.  As a songwriter, she has teamed up with jazz great Jeff Lorber and producers Zack Harmon and Chris Troy.  Nikki has since released her first CD entitled, “The One” in which she wrote the majority of the songs, five of which were chosen for the Grammy ballot.</p>
<p>•Currently, Nikki has released her version of the Christmas song and “Sound of Music” cover, “My Favorite Things”, which is quickly becoming a holiday favorite as it plays on radio stations in Singapore, England, Miami and Chicago for starters.   Award-winning radio host Rick Party, (Hot 105 Miami) had this to say, “Not only is it a hit, but it's from my favorite all time movie, ""The Sound of Music”!</p>
<p>•2018 will be an even bigger year for Nikki as she plans to release her sophomore CD this summer, further solidifying her place as both writer and artist among the very best to ever do it.</p>
<p><u><strong>THE PROJECT</strong></u></p>
<p>This project aptly entitled, “Dangerous” is filled with 10 amazing tracks produced by Tyler “King Gas” Gaston, Peter Rafelson, and Damone Arnold thus far.  The flavor is R&amp;B/Hip Hop seasoned with Nikki’s sultry vocals along with some amazing featured mainstream artists like Dave Hollister (committed)  and Ty Dolla $ign (tentative).</p>

My name is Darren Cementina, and I’m a singer/actor/songwriter from Scranton, Pennsylvania, currently pursuing performing arts in NYC. I am raising funds to record and release my first EP!</p><p>Ever since high school, music has always been an outlet and an escape.

<h3>Help support Ottawa songwriter Steve St. Pierre record, release, promote, stress and agonize over his upcoming full-length release 'Dimes.'</h3>
<p>Steve St. Pierre is a songwriter from Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA (and he still feels it's unfortunate that he has to name the country, alas, people are daft). He's been writing and performing long enough that music is still exciting and beautiful and amazing, but not long enough that people know exactly who he is or what he's about.<br/><br/>St. Pierre performed major festivals inside and outside of his hometown, including Ottawa Bluesfest, NXNE, CMW and has nearly sold out the legendary Horseshoe Tavern. Yes, he will cling onto that 'nearly' and will until the day he dies. </p>
<p><strong>'Dimes'</strong> is a collection of songs that finally make sense, and at the age of 35, they couldn't come too soon. Honest, maybe a little too much at times, and lush thank you to the assistance of his producer Stephen Clarke (Ottawa rock royalty — he's going to hate that I put that in there). </p>
<p>Your support will bring 'Dimes' to life. From recording through production, release, promotion and touring and and and. Records cost an unfortunate amount of money if you want to make them work, and this one deserves all the work we can put behind it. </p>

<h3>Slavo Rican Assembly - our first album</h3>
<p><br/>Dear reader,<br/>Thank you for stopping by.<br/><br/>Slavo Rican Assembly is a group of devoted, passionate musicians, who met at the global crossroads that is New York City.<br/><br/>First, a short story about the concept's and the band's  genesis:<br/><br/>My name is Jan Kus (pronounced Yahn Koos), and I am an award-winning, Slovenian-born, NYC-based saxophonist, composer, producer, and bandleader. Since as early as I can remember, I've always been immensely fascinated by  music from all the corners of the world, every style and any genre, as long as it was sincere and heartfelt. I've always had a feel for Latin music, and my childhood stays in Sarajevo, Bosnia, with my extended family infused me with the ""Balkan blues"", or ""sevdah"" as it is called.<br/><br/>Fast forward for some years, and, as fate would have it, I crossed paths with Puerto Rican bassist, Dan Martínez, during our music studies in NYC. Through our friendship and musical connection, I became a sort of an ""adopted"" brother of the young generation of the city's thriving Puerto Rican musical community, most notably as a member of the esteemed Fernando Garcîa Band.<br/><br/>What started as a kind of a word play, a  joke based on my untypical background for a <i>bomba</i>, <i>salsa</i> and <i>rumba</i> playing Latin Jazz saxophonist, grew stronger during my two trips to Puerto Rico in 2014 and 2018, and finally flourished fully into a deep and profound musical concept - <strong>Slavo Rican</strong>!<br/>Slavic and Puerto Rican, Balkan and Caribbean, a sound that aims to connect with your spirit in various ways, by being melancholic and groovy at the same time, feeling ethereal, yet grounded.<br/><br/>It has been my TREMENDOUS honor  to have some of New York City's finest musicians from both sides of the Slavo Rican equation collaborate with me on this crazy scientists' formula of mine. :)<br/><br/>The group features Aleksandra Denda from Serbia on vocals, Žan Tetičkovič aka Jean John from Slovenia on drums, Puerto Ricans Dan Martínez on bass, Victor Pablo on percussion, and Gabriel Vicéns on guitar, along with Ahmed Alom Vega from Cuba on the piano and keyboards.<br/><br/>Through the bands' collective talents and efforts, I can honestly say that the music started growing FAR beyond my wildest dreams in our three years of existence so far, so it was a pretty easy, and very inspiring task to keep writing and writing new pieces for the group, until we got to a point where we now have enough material to probably record three albums at this point!<br/>It is with great joy and sense of fulfillment that I see the group starting to make some noise on the NYC music scene, where we regularly perform at various notable venues across town.<br/><br/><strong>MORE INFO ABOUT THE BAND IS AVAILABLE HERE:</strong><br/>Our website: <a href=""http://www.jankusmusic.com/slavorican"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.jankusmusic.com/slavorican</a><br/>Our Instagram page: <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/slavorican/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.instagram.com/slavorican/</a><br/>Our Facebook page:<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/SlavoRican/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/SlavoRican/</a><br/><br/>The group's chemistry and family-like bond  both on and off-stage, is also at an impressive high, which was on full display during our highly successful Summer 2019 tour of Slovenia, where we performed at some of the most acclaimed European musical festivals, next to names like Snarky Puppy and Kenny Garrett, to a highly enthusiastic response from our audiences.<br/>That response honestly means THE WORLD to me, since I feel this is the first time in my life I have truly cracked the code of writing something that speaks equally to my group's musicians, and to listeners from ALL WALKS OF LIFE, regardless of their musical knowledge or background, and across a wide variety of cultures, as well.<br/> </p>
<p>There is a quote from Ken Wilber that I hold very dear to my heart, and it goes:</p>
<p>""At integral consciousness we begin to be able to create new tribal connections, but this time they are more memetic than genetic, more organized around ideas than blood relations. We’re able to experience the juice of being deeply bonded to all kinds of people in ways that are not exclusive but expansive.""<br/><br/>I believe that with this group's unique musical concept, and with the chemistry of this specific group of musicians, we have a chance to achieve that!<br/><br/>We recently released our debut single to many heartfelt and MUCH APPRECIATED compliments from our listeners, but considering all of the above, it is now HIGH TIME for us to head into the studio and record the rest of our <strong>FIRST ALBUM</strong>!<br/>...<br/>To be able to achieve that, however, we could really use your support.<br/>Making an album these days is not cheap, since the old model of labels covering the costs of production are essentially over, and the musicians are left with kind of  the DIY (do it yourself) model. The expenses of making an album are more throughly broken down below.<br/><br/>We would really love to document this part of our musical journey forever, before the magic fades away, and making an album will SURELY give new breath to our creativity, as well as open many doors for us in our continuation of our common musical path.Most importantly, it  would also give <strong>YOU</strong>, our dear listeners, a chance to listen to our music every time when you feel like you might need some Slavo Rican medicine for your SOUL in this busy and overwhelming world we live in. :)</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get<br/> </h3>
<p>COSTS<br/><br/>As I mentioned earlier, here are the costs of making an album broken down.<br/>The money we are trying to raise will be used towards the following steps in the process of the creation of the album:<br/><br/>-Studio time</p>
<p>-Editing, Post-Production, Mixing, Mastering</p>
<p>-Musicians' fees</p>
<p>-Creation of promotional materials</p>
<p>-Artwork</p>
<p>-Printing of the album (of the disc and/or download cards)</p>
<p>-Publicity expenses</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are doing our best to keep all of these at a minimum, but believe us, 10000$ is really the minimum when you're trying to make all of that happen, especially at a level of high quality for a project of this magnitude. <br/><br/><br/>REWARDS (PERKS)<br/><br/>In return for your generous contribution, we will reward you with some pretty unique and interesting perks, such as:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>-Signed copies of the album</p>
<p>-Extra footage from  the recording session and our Summer 2019 tour</p>
<p>-Concert tickets and VIP hangout with the band at our potential CD release show</p>

</div></div>","Slavo Rican Assembly - our first album
Dear reader,Thank you for stopping by.Slavo Rican Assembly is a group of devoted, passionate musicians, who met at the global crossroads that is New York City.First, a short story about the concept's and the band's  genesis:My name is Jan Kus (pronounced Yahn Koos), and I am an award-winning, Slovenian-born, NYC-based saxophonist, composer, producer, and bandleader. Since as early as I can remember, I've always been immensely fascinated by  music from all the corners of the world, every style and any genre, as long as it was sincere and heartfelt. I've always had a feel for Latin music, and my childhood stays in Sarajevo, Bosnia, with my extended family infused me with the ""Balkan blues"", or ""sevdah"" as it is called.Fast forward for some years, and, as fate would have it, I crossed paths with Puerto Rican bassist, Dan Martínez, during our music studies in NYC. Through our friendship and musical connection, I became a sort of an ""adopted"" brother of the young generation of the city's thriving Puerto Rican musical community, most notably as a member of the esteemed Fernando Garcîa Band.What started as a kind of a word play, a  joke based on my untypical background for a bomba, salsa and rumba playing Latin Jazz saxophonist, grew stronger during my two trips to Puerto Rico in 2014 and 2018, and finally flourished fully into a deep and profound musical concept - Slavo Rican!Slavic and Puerto Rican, Balkan and Caribbean, a sound that aims to connect with your spirit in various ways, by being melancholic and groovy at the same time, feeling ethereal, yet grounded.It has been my TREMENDOUS honor  to have some of New York City's finest musicians from both sides of the Slavo Rican equation collaborate with me on this crazy scientists' formula of mine. :)The group features Aleksandra Denda from Serbia on vocals, Žan Tetičkovič aka Jean John from Slovenia on drums, Puerto Ricans Dan Martínez on bass, Victor Pablo on percussion, and Gabriel Vicéns on guitar, along with Ahmed Alom Vega from Cuba on the piano and keyboards.Through the bands' collective talents and efforts, I can honestly say that the music started growing FAR beyond my wildest dreams in our three years of existence so far, so it was a pretty easy, and very inspiring task to keep writing and writing new pieces for the group, until we got to a point where we now have enough material to probably record three albums at this point!It is with great joy and sense of fulfillment that I see the group starting to make some noise on the NYC music scene, where we regularly perform at various notable venues across town.MORE INFO ABOUT THE BAND IS AVAILABLE HERE:Our website: www.jankusmusic.com/slavoricanOur Instagram page: https://www.instagram.com/slavorican/Our Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/SlavoRican/The group's chemistry and family-like bond  both on and off-stage, is also at an impressive high, which was on full display during our highly successful Summer 2019 tour of Slovenia, where we performed at some of the most acclaimed European musical festivals, next to names like Snarky Puppy and Kenny Garrett, to a highly enthusiastic response from our audiences.That response honestly means THE WORLD to me, since I feel this is the first time in my life I have truly cracked the code of writing something that speaks equally to my group's musicians, and to listeners from ALL WALKS OF LIFE, regardless of their musical knowledge or background, and across a wide variety of cultures, as well. 
There is a quote from Ken Wilber that I hold very dear to my heart, and it goes:
""At integral consciousness we begin to be able to create new tribal connections, but this time they are more memetic than genetic, more organized around ideas than blood relations. We’re able to experience the juice of being deeply bonded to all kinds of people in ways that are not exclusive but expansive.""I believe that with this group's unique musical concept, and with the chemistry of this specific group of musicians, we have a chance to achieve that!We recently released our debut single to many heartfelt and MUCH APPRECIATED compliments from our listeners, but considering all of the above, it is now HIGH TIME for us to head into the studio and record the rest of our FIRST ALBUM!...To be able to achieve that, however, we could really use your support.Making an album these days is not cheap, since the old model of labels covering the costs of production are essentially over, and the musicians are left with kind of  the DIY (do it yourself) model. The expenses of making an album are more throughly broken down below.We would really love to document this part of our musical journey forever, before the magic fades away, and making an album will SURELY give new breath to our creativity, as well as open many doors for us in our continuation of our common musical path.Most importantly, it  would also give YOU, our dear listeners, a chance to listen to our music every time when you feel like you might need some Slavo Rican medicine for your SOUL in this busy and overwhelming world we live in. :)


 
What We Need & What You Get 
COSTSAs I mentioned earlier, here are the costs of making an album broken down.The money we are trying to raise will be used towards the following steps in the process of the creation of the album:-Studio time
-Editing, Post-Production, Mixing, Mastering
-Musicians' fees
-Creation of promotional materials
-Artwork
-Printing of the album (of the disc and/or download cards)
-Publicity expenses
 
We are doing our best to keep all of these at a minimum, but believe us, 10000$ is really the minimum when you're trying to make all of that happen, especially at a level of high quality for a project of this magnitude. REWARDS (PERKS)In return for your generous contribution, we will reward you with some pretty unique and interesting perks, such as:
 
-Signed copies of the album
-Extra footage from  the recording session and our Summer 2019 tour
-Concert tickets and VIP hangout with the band at our potential CD release show
-Private lessons with our band members
-Rehearsal access
-Bonus tracks
-Private in house concerts!!AND MORE!
 

The Impact
I like to believe that art has the capacity to, if not change the world, at least nudge it towards being a little better, a little more united, a little more connected, a little less estranged, a little more heartfelt, and a little less self centered.And, out of all the arts, music is probably the one that can bridge the biggest gaps, since it speaks equally to the body, the soul, and the mind, and is not bound by a specific language, but rather speaks in a common, universal tongue, the deepest expression of the truth of the human condition.Given the state of the world today, with all the political, socio-economical, tribalistic, and ecological tensions across numerous divides going on, I would humbly hope that a project like ours can, by using our media of communication, which is sound, touch a few hearts, open a few minds, or illuminate a few souls and demonstrate that AUTHENTIC connection between fellow humans from different backgrounds IS POSSIBLE.

<h3>WHO WE ARE</h3>
<p><i>Learn about San Antonio's newest chamber ensemble.</i></p>
<p>The San Antonio Harmonie Ensemble (a.k.a. SAHarmonie) is a group of like-minded musicians with a passion for performing chamber music at the highest level.

<h3>Who Am I?</h3>
<p>I am March, a songwriter/artist/musician from the village of Claygate, Surrey. I have just moved back home after living in Southampton for four years, a place that holds lots of the memories behind and the delivery of these songs. I have been writing and performing now for 6 or so years, with some of my recent highlights being playing at Glastonbury Fest '19, doing a BBC Introducing Live Lounge (watch <a href=""https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07h0hwz"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>) and writing and releasing an EP 'Wear Me Down'. I previously released an album 'Giving in to You' under the name Kitty O'Neal which you can listen to<a href=""https://open.spotify.com/album/0GQN3TIL00LZDu7gYVPxr4?si=Qdr57dP9TmOsSMhWBMGX9Q"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> </a><u><a href=""https://open.spotify.com/album/0GQN3TIL00LZDu7gYVPxr4?si=vHsS7wrsSiG4vlUfmWsenA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a></u><a href=""https://open.spotify.com/album/0GQN3TIL00LZDu7gYVPxr4?si=Qdr57dP9TmOsSMhWBMGX9Q"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>.</u></a> I am very proud of this work, but have taken a slightly different direction which I am very excited about - you can read more about this (and my name change) in a blog post on my website <u><a href=""http://marchofficial.uk/dear-friends-family-followers-fellow-artists-and-the-future/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</u> My new EP 'Wear Me Down' is available for streaming on Bandcamp <a href=""http://marchofficialuk.bandcamp.com/album/wear-me-down-2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a> and Spotify<a href=""https://open.spotify.com/artist/20OZN9cKdRFmYZcvtTgqSr?si=TSwwBKdJREWyngeLz8HINQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> here.</a> </p>
<p>After organising a short 2-week UK tour and spending my first year out of university trying to gig as much as possible, I entered into a phase of feeling rather musically uninspired, physically and mentally burnt out from working pretty hard at my day job (I was a co-ordinator at a quirky non-profit, volunteer run arts hub/vegetarian cafe called The Art House), and it took a while to get back into the flow of writing. 2018 held quite a lot of personal challenges, but by the end of the year I was full to the brim of stories, thoughts, conversations and reflections and so I finally returned home to my creative zone and have been on a little creating adventure ever since. I have taken the time to read books about creativity, writing, humans, history, the planet, dreams (where I have found a fair bit of inspiration for my new songs). I have listened to a lot of new music, met many new people from all walks of life in my job, lived with and surrounded myself with like-minded creatives, and played a lot of really cool shows all over the place. My new songs take inspiration from all of this information I have taken in, and all of the experiences I have had in the last year, making it a pretty personal selection of songs which I would love to put together on a record. </p>
<p>Because it is personal, I feel very protective over this work and it feels really special to me to potentially have the opportunity to record and release it. I am doing this completely independently, I don't have a record label but I do have all the power (mua ha ha) and I love the idea of being able to communicate and connect directly with the people who want to listen to my music. This means there is no support, managerial or financial, behind me which is why I have turned to you guys and IndieGoGo. The only funds I have to pursue creative projects like recording this album are what I can put in myself, which has proven difficult in the past, and I would really appreciate the help. In fact, without any help from supporters I just wouldn't be able to do any of this. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>If you're unsure about what a crowdfunder is, essentially it is just pre-ordering the album before I actually make it. That way, I can use the money raised to make the album now. There are also lots of other little treats that I have come up with, exclusive to you guys, which means I can connect with you in lots of other ways. (For example I have created some handmade rewards, the option to hold a house concert, download my unheard demos and more...)</p>
<p>I plan to dry-hire a studio space (this means hiring a space where you can take your own engineer and gear) which means I can work with my best friends on this project. I am going to be working with my bud Dan Keen (studio engineer/producer/composer) and some other musical pals and session musicians (not giving too much away yet!), making this a very collaborative project.</p>
<p>£5000 may sound like a lot of money to somebody who doesn't hang out in this industry, but actually I am doing this as DIY as possible and other projects of the same manner would probably be more like double this. I'm willing to put in as much of my own money (and time, love, willpower, energy, oomph), but really need to raise as much of this amount as possible to create the album that I hear in my head. The main costs are studio hire, recording fees, session musicians, mixing, mastering, pressing, PR...you get the idea! I want to give these songs the respect and professionalism that they deserve, and I trust that you'll be able to hear the difference when I do this right.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If you support me, I can make this album and continue trying to do the only thing I know how to do well! I have nearly everything ready to go - the songs are almost there, the humans I want to involve are beside me most days, I have a timeline in my head, I'm working on launch and tour plans...I just need some funds to help me get going. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I am totally confident that I will deliver all of your rewards. One way or another this album is going to get recorded. There is always a risk of a little extra cost here and there, perhaps an extra day needed in the studio, but it's nothing a couple of hours of busking won't fix. I trust in the process and have faith that I will get this out to you by the end of 2020. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I understand completely that some of you may not be able to help me financially. I would be eternally grateful if you could share this campaign around to your friends who may be able to help, and spread the word of a new album from March.</p>

This has been a dream of mine
and every time I thought about it, it seemed and still seems so impossible due to all the things
that’s involved in getting it done, but after a long journey of ups and downs,
though nothing is perfect yet, I am trusting the Lord and taking this step of
faith for him to walk me through this journey.</span></p>
<p>All I have is Him “God”, His songs of worship, and your
support to make this dream become a reality. 
Each one of us has a purpose, a divine assignment, a specific task, a call by the Father
himself to do something on his behalf. Though it’s encouraging and exciting to discover what
that purpose is, at the same time, it’s A DAUNTING task trying to accomplish
the very thing, that will define your purpose. Everyone needs a helping hand. And
today I need your hand of support to get to the finish line.</p>
<p>My assignment for this worship encounter on <b>Oct 24th 2015</b>, is to usher
everyone and anyone that is willing to go with me INTO HIS PRESENCE, and once we get before Him, my work is done and He the “LORD” will take over, depending on what the personal needs are. </p>

<p>This live worship
album recording will cost $25k to make! I know that is a lot of
money...and it IS!!.  Making a live album recording is expensive!  but I have thought (and budgeted) long
and hard, and at some point, I wanted to put this project off, but I feel like
I’ve struck a good balance between being frugal and turning out a quality
product for you to experience and also listen to!!  </p>
<p>Where is all this
money going to go?  I’ll break down the list of costs here for you: </p>

They believe is us… now we're asking for your support! Please consider donating whatever you can. You can also help us by spreading the word… and sharing our campaign with your friends and fellow jazz lovers. It goes without saying that we also hope you'll join us for the Festival to enjoy the music you've made possible! </p>

We have a great little team… but we can't do this alone! We have already secured funding from Taos County, the Town of Taos, Taos Community Foundation and Kind World Foundation, as well as local private donors. They believe is us… now we're asking for your support! Please consider donating whatever you can. You can also help us by spreading the word… and sharing our campaign with your friends and fellow jazz lovers. It goes without saying that we also hope you'll join us for the Festival to enjoy the music you've made possible! 


Not only that… you will have our endless gratitude and one of our special thank you gifts: from a great-looking Taos Jazz Bebop Society T-shirt, to autographed Grace Kelly CDs, or the one-of-a-kind silver ring worn by Frank Morgan himself! Most importantly, you will be making it possible for us to continue with our work of building a thriving scene for jazz in northern New Mexico.











If you love jazz, help us to make sure it flourishes in Taos, New Mexico!

<div>Two dreams with one campaign.</div>
<div>First: My dream of writing a song and having it professionally produced</div>
<div>Second: A couple's dream of having children</div>
<div> <h3>How?</h3>Step 1: Write a song<br/>
</div>
<div>Step 2: Find a professional singer to help perfect it, produce it and then perform it.</div>

<div>Simple, right?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>Why?</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>Ray and Julie Stewart have been married for 12 years and have been hoping to have children. They’ve tried every technique without success. Over a year ago they turned to adoption. Modern adoption, however, has changed dramatically in recent years. To adopt today, you basically have to market yourself through social media, blogging and profiles on adoption websites. Think <a href=""http://match.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>Match.com</span></a> for adoption. These changes overall are fantastic for the industry, but they aren’t without their problems. At 5’ 6” and 380 lbs it was very hard for Ray to feel comfortable marketing himself. Harder still as his wife is overweight as well. At the beginning of this year Ray and Julie didn’t see how they could possibly attract someone to give their child to them.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Ten months ago everything changed when Ray entered a contest to be on a new reality TV show all about losing weight. He won the contest and he and Julie have since transformed not only their bodies but their lives. In fact they have motivated hundreds around them to do the same. At the heart of their transformation has been their yearning to be parents. In the process Ray coined the phrase, “Do It Anyway” — pointing to how he treats doing very difficult things (he just finished doing the Spartan Beast!). </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>His personal trainer (a local trainer who agreed to train him on the TV show) and his nutritionist (his trainer’s wife) have helped him lose over 150 lbs. in less than seven months. One of the incredible by-products of his transformation is that his trainer and nutritionist have started a fitness challenge called ""The Simple Clean Eats 40 Day Challenge”. I was involved in the first one held in July and August. I ended up being the co-winner of the challenge. I lost 20 lbs. in 40 days. It was amazing! </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>As a result of Ray and Julie's story I wrote a country song called, “Do It Anyway”. I wanted to somehow ""give"" this song to Ray and Julie in celebration of what they've done and how much they've inspired me and others. The problem is, I don't have the voice nor the band for it.  So I decided to look for a local band to produce the song. I needed a very specific sounding, deep, resonating voice that could pump people up.</p>
<p>That's what this is all about. I want a professional band to help finish my song, produce it and sing it at a live event on October 19th. That's why I have such a lofty goal of $10,000. Producing a song is crazy expensive and renting a place to host a star performer is as well. Since I'm not exactly rolling, I've turned to crowdsourcing. I think I have a story worth sharing and there's no better way than a good old country song, sung by one of the hottest up and coming country stars to share it.</p>
<p>Now, I just need <i>your</i> help!</p>

<h2>Music has been my passion since I started singing at the age of 12. Since then, it's become who I am and what I am known for.</h2> <p>My name is Erin Burke,</p>
<p>I have started this campaign to fund my new record!   </p>
<p>I have had this new project circling my thoughts since the release of my first E.P. in early 2015. I knew I wanted my next project to show how serious I am about music. I needed to find a producer who had the skill and experience to help me make a statement for this new record.</p>
<p>Matt Troja, an outstanding producer that knows what it takes to produce the sound I’m looking for. He has recorded and worked with top artists like, Keith Urban, Sara Evans, Jeff Coffin from The David Mathews Band, and many other top musicians. This opportunity to work with Matt is so important to me. Working together as a team, we will find the right sound and style that's fit for me. With your help, we can achieve a dream I have held onto tightly since the beginning of my music career.</p>
<h3>Here's The Breakdown:</h3>
<p>For this campaign's ultimate success, we need to raise $15,000.</p>
<p>Yes! I know what you're thinking, ""what a fun number!""</p>
<p>Let me explain, we are looking to put 6-7 tracks on this record. With professional production of each song and the cost of mixing and mastering, the price becomes hefty.</p>
<p>This number can be met in the time span of 60 days that we have.</p>
<p>For this campaign, I've created an advertising plan for specific social media platforms that will reach beyond our local towns. This will help get the word out. But, I still need your HELP with contributions and much sharing. I wouldn't be reaching for this BIG GOAL if I didn't think we could do it!</p> <p>Here's some more detail about YOUR perks!</p>
<p>This is the most exciting part.</p>
<p>A contribution range of $10 to $1,000 means a wide variety of awesome gifts!</p>
<p>Items such as:</p>
<p>    </p>
<p>-Stickers</p>
<p>-Signed posters and hard copies of the E.P.</p>
<p>-Exclusive early downloads of the released single</p>
<p>-Individual acknowledgement on the records credits</p>
<p>-Choice of a 2 hour event where I will perform songs off the E.P. and many other favorites</p>
<p>-Personal thank you letters</p>
<p>-Original lyrics</p>
<p>-A video cover of your favorite song</p>
<p>-The grand gift: A personal at home concert for your family and friends. That's right! I'll be bringing the music right to you!</p>

<br/>THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND CONTRIBUTIONS!</h2>
</div></div>","Music has been my passion since I started singing at the age of 12. Since then, it's become who I am and what I am known for. My name is Erin Burke,
I have started this campaign to fund my new record!   
I have had this new project circling my thoughts since the release of my first E.P. in early 2015. I knew I wanted my next project to show how serious I am about music. I needed to find a producer who had the skill and experience to help me make a statement for this new record.
Matt Troja, an outstanding producer that knows what it takes to produce the sound I’m looking for. He has recorded and worked with top artists like, Keith Urban, Sara Evans, Jeff Coffin from The David Mathews Band, and many other top musicians. This opportunity to work with Matt is so important to me. Working together as a team, we will find the right sound and style that's fit for me. With your help, we can achieve a dream I have held onto tightly since the beginning of my music career.
Here's The Breakdown:
For this campaign's ultimate success, we need to raise $15,000.
Yes! I know what you're thinking, ""what a fun number!""
Let me explain, we are looking to put 6-7 tracks on this record. With professional production of each song and the cost of mixing and mastering, the price becomes hefty.
This number can be met in the time span of 60 days that we have.
For this campaign, I've created an advertising plan for specific social media platforms that will reach beyond our local towns. This will help get the word out. But, I still need your HELP with contributions and much sharing. I wouldn't be reaching for this BIG GOAL if I didn't think we could do it! Here's some more detail about YOUR perks!
This is the most exciting part.
A contribution range of $10 to $1,000 means a wide variety of awesome gifts!
Items such as:
    
-Stickers
-Signed posters and hard copies of the E.P.
-Exclusive early downloads of the released single
-Individual acknowledgement on the records credits
-Choice of a 2 hour event where I will perform songs off the E.P. and many other favorites
-Personal thank you letters
-Original lyrics
-A video cover of your favorite song
-The grand gift: A personal at home concert for your family and friends. That's right! I'll be bringing the music right to you!
