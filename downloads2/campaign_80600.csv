<a href=""http://twitter.com/weatnu"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">#WEATNU</a> is a collective effort to help the indie underground artist.

<div>To change how people receive electronic music and provide a career for the independent artist through self-promo and auto-promotion, including web presence.

<p><b>Recording <i>(Producer, Singers, Musicians, Recording Truck, Engineers,
Gear rental, techs, etc.): $15,000</i></b></p>

We pride ourselves on our high musical standards and our sense of community. Thanks to our outstanding instructors, our students learn amazing musical skills in a fun environment.</span></span></p>

</div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3> <p>In order to get this project off of the ground we will need $4,246 for equipment and supplies, such as:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>JamHub 7-Section System: For recording entire bands.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Music Production Software: Cubase software provides a great range of features to help mix the music track.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Video Production Software: Both the GoPro Software and PowerDirector will allow us to mix the video footage giving a personalized video recording.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Four GoPro Cameras: This will give a variety of angles with great video quality.</li></ul>

</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This equipment will not only allow for us to make the audio and video recording studio, but will give us the opportunity to expand the Drum &amp; Drummer reach by offering online lessons.</p>
<p>We will be able to provide one-on-one video conference lessons. Like the private lessons we offer here in Tucson, we will be able to take a personal hands-on approach to students all over the country.</p>
<p>This will also give us the chance to offer prerecorded online lessons and memberships; empowering students all over the world to learn the Colored Stick Program at their own pace anytime and anywhere.</p>

</div></div>","A Little About Drum & Drummer
Here at Drum & Drummer School of Music we have spent the last four years focusing on providing the best experience possible. Our students have dedicated themselves to learning a variety of instruments including: drums, piano, guitar, bass, and even the banjo. We pride ourselves on our high musical standards and our sense of community. Thanks to our outstanding instructors, our students learn amazing musical skills in a fun environment.
Drum & Drummer is also the only music school in the world to offer Erik Truelove's unique Colored Stick Program. Much like the martial arts, this curriculum is designed to allow the student to progress at their own pace, but in a very structured and rewarding setting.
We are now looking to expand our services. The audio and video recording studio will enable us to provide excellent recording quality for people who couldn't otherwise afford a top notch recording session. Whether it's a solo musician performing a cover song, or an entire band playing original music; we will be able to produce a high quality digital recording of their music as well as a multi-angled video of the recording session. 
In addition to our recording services, we will be providing online music lessons. This will allow us to reach a wider audience of developing musicians and help us grow as a school.
We already have the space, now we just need the equipment.






  What We Need In order to get this project off of the ground we will need $4,246 for equipment and supplies, such as:


JamHub 7-Section System: For recording entire bands.
Music Production Software: Cubase software provides a great range of features to help mix the music track.
Video Production Software: Both the GoPro Software and PowerDirector will allow us to mix the video footage giving a personalized video recording.
Four GoPro Cameras: This will give a variety of angles with great video quality.
Camera Mounts: What good is a camera without a mount.
A Desktop Computer: This will allow us to mix the audio and video recordings here at Drum & Drummer.

    The Impact
This equipment will not only allow for us to make the audio and video recording studio, but will give us the opportunity to expand the Drum & Drummer reach by offering online lessons.
We will be able to provide one-on-one video conference lessons. Like the private lessons we offer here in Tucson, we will be able to take a personal hands-on approach to students all over the country.
This will also give us the chance to offer prerecorded online lessons and memberships; empowering students all over the world to learn the Colored Stick Program at their own pace anytime and anywhere.

The Perks
So what do you get for your contribution?


$5 gets you a personal hand-written thank you card from everyone here at Drum & Drummer.

$6 gets you a Drum & Drummer key chain. 




$25 will get you one of our swag packs that will include a Drum & Drummer key chain, water bottle, and T-shirt. 






$26 gets you a one-on-one Skype style lesson from one of our outstanding drum instructors once the campaign has ended. *Email if you have any questions about scheduling.


$50 gets you Studio Recording Time, this includes up to 45 minutes of recording and 45 minutes of editing.              *Image above is not our actual studio.

$250 or $350, depending on the area, will get you a DJ Drum House Party. *Email if you have any questions about scheduling.




    Risks & Challenges 
So what happens if we don't reach our goal?
We still intend to build this studio. It has been an idea that we have wanted to move forward with for some time. However, If we are unable to purchase all of the items we want for our perfect recording studio, we will still budget to get the items we need to make a great studio. And don't worry, anyone who does contribute will still receive their perk items once the studio is up and running.
    Other Ways You Can Help 
We understand that not all who are reading this have money to donate, but fret not - there are other ways that you can help!
If you have any recording equipment that you are not using and would like to donate we will graciously accept it. 
Please share this page around with your friends and family, we have a lot of money to raise to make this dream a reality, so the more people that hear about it the better.

IF WE DONT REACH OUR GOAL:



 If we
don’t reach our Goal we must do our best to be a Band With a Van and Spread  our
Music across the states and beyond with what we have. 
Our first purchase would be a van to allow us to continue to be able to travel to our shows.

Our next priority is Road-ready amps and cases. This will ensure that we never have a problem with any of the equipment being provided as we perform at different venues across the country.
Following the purchase of our vehicle and our performance equipment, we will invest in band merchandise such as t-shirts, posters, stickers etc. The merchandise will not only give fans something to remember the show and experience by, but will be a sustainable revenue stream for us to invest in extending our tour from city to city.
Once we have purchased all of the items we need to make this tour possible, any left over funds will go to maintenance of the vehicle, feeding the band (Band Droidz have to eat too!), paying our various support team members (booking agent, manager, roadies etc), gas money
   The Impact
 While we have played many local shows in NYC and understood the impact our music had on our community here, we had no idea how our message would reach as many people as it did on our recent tour with the 
Desaparecidos and The So So Glos. Our fans left our shows energized and ready to take on the powers of oppression. 
    Risks & Challenges
 So far, we have overcome so many challenges that we are confident that we can conquer anything. 
Not having our own vehicle and equipment has led to us having to adapt to some extreme situations at times.
We have had a borrowed vehicle break down in the middle of a tour. We have slept in a van at a rest stop between shows.  We have driven long distances in between gigs to show up and find that the venue had been double booked.  But through all of this, we persevered.  We are serious about this mission that we are on and we are willing to put up with less than desirable situations in order to continue the fight.

<h3>Our Project<br/>
</h3> <p></p>
<p>Founded in 2013, Pronto Musica is
a non-profit organization which provides professional-quality performance
opportunities to promising classical musicians who are transitioning between
post-secondary education and the professional world. <strong>Our mission is to create a full-time professional training orchestra in Canada.</strong> <b></b></p>
<p><b>The need for an orchestral training program in Canada is
dire</b>.  Similar programs have existed
for almost 30 years in the United States and Europe with impressive audition success rates for
their fellows.  Aside from summer
training programs, there is no environment for musicians in Canada that enables
them to continue their orchestral development upon finishing their studies.  Many musicians have to turn to work in unrelated
fields to support themselves financially, usually at the expense of their
practice time.  We feel strongly that this initiative would
not only help the emerging musicians of today, but that it would also
contribute greatly to the future of classical music in Canada. <br/><br/></p>
<p></p>
</div><div>
<h3>

The Impact of Your Donation<br/>
</h3>
<p>Our initiative is one that we want to grow to a full-time, national scale, something which would be fully realized in the next 3 to 4 years.  In the short term, the campaign funds will go to financing our current season (details below!) and stipends for musicians, which means the immediate creation of, and accessibility to, orchestral training for these players.  The campaign funds will also go towards a marketing budget that will be used to pitch Pronto Musica to major financial and musical organizations who can give us the stable, large-scale funding required to fulfill our mission.  Not to mention, the contributions of people like you across the country will show them the enthusiasm and need for an orchestral training program in Canada!<br/><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Key Facts for Our 2015-2016 Season</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Our 2015/2016 season
consists of 2 orchestra concerts featuring professional soloists,
including Axel Strauss (violin), Matt Haimovitz (cello) and Philip Chiu (piano) in the Beethoven Triple Concerto in March 2016</li>
<li>An additional surprise event will be announced shortly, featuring the Montreal Symphony's Principal Trumpet, Paul Merkelo, as soloist! <br/>
</li>
<li>Repertoire is selected by
our Artistic Director, Maestro Alexis Hauser, based on ensemble size, relevance
to orchestral training and promotion of Canadian composers.  This season's highlights are the Fauré

Requiem,  Stravinsky's Pulcinella Suite and Beethoven's 8th Symphony.  Click<a href=""http://prontomusica.org/Events/englishEvents.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> here</a> for full details!<br/>
</li>
<li>Musicians are expected to
attend four 3-hour rehearsals in preparation for each concert</li>
<li>Chamber music concerts are
planned throughout the season depending on availability and initiative of
musicians in the program<br/><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Who are these young musicians you're supporting? <br/>
</h3>
<p>The musicians in Pronto Musica are a group of Canada's most promising classical music talent.  Presently, they are primarily graduates of McGill University, the University of Montreal and the Montreal Conservatory, though several members also hold degrees from international music schools, including the Yale School of Music, The New England Conservatory, the Manhattan School of Music and the San Francisco Conservatory.  Our orchestra is also home to many winners of major national competitions, including the Montreal Symphony Orchestra Standard Life Competition, McGill's Golden Violin Competition, and the Canada Council Instrument Bank Auditions, to name a few.   These young musicians are incredibly talented and at the top of their game.   We want to help them keep their momentum after graduation so that they are able to transition into the professional world and begin their careers in orchestras around the world.  <br/></p>
<h3></h3>
<br/><h3>Short-Term Goals (2016-2017 Season) <br/>
</h3> <p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase the number of
concerts in our annual concert series (6-8 per year)</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Increase the size of the
orchestra to include full brass and percussion sections</li>
<li>Offer masterclasses and coachings with professional orchestral musicians</li>
<li>Upgrade to a larger concert
venue with more seating and built-in box office</li>
<li>Create fund for percussion
instrument rental and transport</li>
<li>Create fund for paid
advertising/marketing <br/><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p> <ul></ul> </div> <div>
<h3>Long-Term Goals (2017 onwards)</h3>
<h1>
</h1>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Establish infrastructure
for a full-time training program (30 concerts per year)</li>
<li>Recruit musicians at a
national level<span></span>
</li>
<li>
<span></span>Offer housing and living
stipends to musicians <br/>
</li>
<li>Offer a salary to the
members of the administrative team</li>
<li>Provide travel stipends to
Pronto musicians for competitions and auditions</li>
</ul> </div> <br/><h3>Budget</h3>The more we raise, the better and more accessible we can make this program for musicians.  We want to be able to provide them with a stipend that makes it financially possible for them to devote the time to their training, but this amount will vary depending on funding.  We also have to deal with logistical costs —

 for example, logistics of one concert alone can cost $10,000 when considering the following: <br/><br/><ul>
<li>Venue rental and insurance: $3,500</li>
<li>Rehearsal space rental: $2,000</li>
<li>Library rental: $1,000</li>
<li>Audio and Video Recording: $500</li>
<li>Printing (programs, posters) and Translation: $500</li>
<li>Advertising: $500</li>
<li>Reception costs: $300</li>
<li>Percussion rental and transportation: $500 <br/>
</li>
</ul><div> <p><b>Every dollar contributes to the success of these talented young musicians.</b><br/></p>
<h3>
<br/>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>Please spread the word! Share our campaign via e-mail, Facebook, Twitter, Google+, word of mouth — every little mention helps us get closer to our goal of making our training program a reality.   Thank you! <br/><br/><br/>------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>
<h3><b>Notre Project</b></h3>
<p>Fondé en
2013, Pronto Musica est une organisation à but non-lucratif qui a comme but de
fournir des opportunités de performance au niveau professionnel aux jeunes musiciens
émergeants qui font transition du monde postsecondaire au monde professionnel. <strong>Notre but est de créer un orchestre de formation professionnelle (à temps plein) au Canada.</strong><span></span></p>
<p><b>Le besoin d’un tel programme d’orchestre au
Canada est d’une dure nécessité. </b>Des projets similaires existent déjà depuis une trentaine d'années aux
États-Unis et en Europe et les jeunes musiciens qui y participent connaissent
un grand succès lors de leurs auditions.<span>  Par
contre, </span>à part les programmes d’été, la possibilité de continuer leur développement
orchestral n’existe pas pour la plupart des musiciens canadiens qui doivent prendre
n’importe quel travail pour gagner leur vie au détriment de leurs poursuites
musicales.<span>  Nous croyons que notre programme
aurait non seulement un impact immédiat pour nos musiciens, mais qu’il contribuerait
aussi à l’avenir de la musique classique au Canada.</span></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3><b>L’impacte qu’auront vos dons</b></h3>
<p>Nous voulons
que notre initiative s’agrandisse dans les prochaines trois à quatre années
pour atteindre un niveau national à temps plein. Pour l’instant, vos dons serviront
à financer notre saison 2015-2016 et à fournir un revenu à nos musiciens, donc
créant une opportunité de formation
immédiate pour eux. Nous voulons aussi créer un budget de marketing qui nous permettra de lancer nos
idées aux institutions financières et aux organisations musicales. Il va sans
dire que vos dons montreraient non seulement l’enthousiasme des gens à travers
le Canada envers ce programme mais aussi le besoin!</p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3><b>Les points saillants de notre saison 2015-2016</b></h3>
<ul>
<li>Cette saison consistera de deux concerts
d’orchestre mettant en vedette des solistes professionnels, dont Axel Strauss
(violon), Matt Haimovitz (violoncelle) et Philip Chiu (piano), qui joueront
ensemble dans le Concerto Triple de Beethoven en mars 2016</li>
<li>Nous avons un évènement spécial qui sera
annoncé sous peu qui mettra en vedette le trompettiste solo de l’Orchestre symphonique
de Montréal, Paul Merkelo!</li>
<li>Le répertoire est sélectionné par notre
directeur artistique, Maestro Alexis Hauser, dépendant de la grandeur de
l’orchestre, de la pertinence aux études orchestrales et de la promotion des
compositeur(e)s canadien(ne)s. Cette année nous présenterons de grandes œuvres,
telles que le Requiem de Fauré, la Suite Pulcinella de Stravinsky et la 8<sup>e</sup>
symphonie de Beethoven. Pour plus de détails, vous pouvez cliquer <a href=""http://prontomusica.org/Events/frenchEvents.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://prontomusica.org/Events/frenchEvents.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ici</a>.</li>

Our Project
 
Founded in 2013, Pronto Musica is
a non-profit organization which provides professional-quality performance
opportunities to promising classical musicians who are transitioning between
post-secondary education and the professional world. Our mission is to create a full-time professional training orchestra in Canada. 
The need for an orchestral training program in Canada is
dire.  Similar programs have existed
for almost 30 years in the United States and Europe with impressive audition success rates for
their fellows.  Aside from summer
training programs, there is no environment for musicians in Canada that enables
them to continue their orchestral development upon finishing their studies.  Many musicians have to turn to work in unrelated
fields to support themselves financially, usually at the expense of their
practice time.  We feel strongly that this initiative would
not only help the emerging musicians of today, but that it would also
contribute greatly to the future of classical music in Canada. 




The Impact of Your Donation

Our initiative is one that we want to grow to a full-time, national scale, something which would be fully realized in the next 3 to 4 years.  In the short term, the campaign funds will go to financing our current season (details below!) and stipends for musicians, which means the immediate creation of, and accessibility to, orchestral training for these players.  The campaign funds will also go towards a marketing budget that will be used to pitch Pronto Musica to major financial and musical organizations who can give us the stable, large-scale funding required to fulfill our mission.  Not to mention, the contributions of people like you across the country will show them the enthusiasm and need for an orchestral training program in Canada!

Key Facts for Our 2015-2016 Season


Our 2015/2016 season
consists of 2 orchestra concerts featuring professional soloists,
including Axel Strauss (violin), Matt Haimovitz (cello) and Philip Chiu (piano) in the Beethoven Triple Concerto in March 2016
An additional surprise event will be announced shortly, featuring the Montreal Symphony's Principal Trumpet, Paul Merkelo, as soloist! 

Repertoire is selected by
our Artistic Director, Maestro Alexis Hauser, based on ensemble size, relevance
to orchestral training and promotion of Canadian composers.  This season's highlights are the Fauré

Requiem,  Stravinsky's Pulcinella Suite and Beethoven's 8th Symphony.  Click here for full details!

Musicians are expected to
attend four 3-hour rehearsals in preparation for each concert
Chamber music concerts are
planned throughout the season depending on availability and initiative of
musicians in the program


Who are these young musicians you're supporting? 

The musicians in Pronto Musica are a group of Canada's most promising classical music talent.  Presently, they are primarily graduates of McGill University, the University of Montreal and the Montreal Conservatory, though several members also hold degrees from international music schools, including the Yale School of Music, The New England Conservatory, the Manhattan School of Music and the San Francisco Conservatory.  Our orchestra is also home to many winners of major national competitions, including the Montreal Symphony Orchestra Standard Life Competition, McGill's Golden Violin Competition, and the Canada Council Instrument Bank Auditions, to name a few.   These young musicians are incredibly talented and at the top of their game.   We want to help them keep their momentum after graduation so that they are able to transition into the professional world and begin their careers in orchestras around the world.  

Short-Term Goals (2016-2017 Season) 
 


Increase the number of
concerts in our annual concert series (6-8 per year)

Increase the size of the
orchestra to include full brass and percussion sections
Offer masterclasses and coachings with professional orchestral musicians
Upgrade to a larger concert
venue with more seating and built-in box office
Create fund for percussion
instrument rental and transport
Create fund for paid
advertising/marketing 


   
Long-Term Goals (2017 onwards)





Establish infrastructure
for a full-time training program (30 concerts per year)
Recruit musicians at a
national level


Offer housing and living
stipends to musicians 

Offer a salary to the
members of the administrative team
Provide travel stipends to
Pronto musicians for competitions and auditions
  BudgetThe more we raise, the better and more accessible we can make this program for musicians.  We want to be able to provide them with a stipend that makes it financially possible for them to devote the time to their training, but this amount will vary depending on funding.  We also have to deal with logistical costs —

 for example, logistics of one concert alone can cost $10,000 when considering the following: 
Venue rental and insurance: $3,500
Rehearsal space rental: $2,000
Library rental: $1,000
Audio and Video Recording: $500
Printing (programs, posters) and Translation: $500
Advertising: $500
Reception costs: $300
Percussion rental and transportation: $500 

 Every dollar contributes to the success of these talented young musicians.

Notre Project
Fondé en
2013, Pronto Musica est une organisation à but non-lucratif qui a comme but de
fournir des opportunités de performance au niveau professionnel aux jeunes musiciens
émergeants qui font transition du monde postsecondaire au monde professionnel. Notre but est de créer un orchestre de formation professionnelle (à temps plein) au Canada.
Le besoin d’un tel programme d’orchestre au
Canada est d’une dure nécessité. Des projets similaires existent déjà depuis une trentaine d'années aux
États-Unis et en Europe et les jeunes musiciens qui y participent connaissent
un grand succès lors de leurs auditions.  Par
contre, à part les programmes d’été, la possibilité de continuer leur développement
orchestral n’existe pas pour la plupart des musiciens canadiens qui doivent prendre
n’importe quel travail pour gagner leur vie au détriment de leurs poursuites
musicales.  Nous croyons que notre programme
aurait non seulement un impact immédiat pour nos musiciens, mais qu’il contribuerait
aussi à l’avenir de la musique classique au Canada.

L’impacte qu’auront vos dons
Nous voulons
que notre initiative s’agrandisse dans les prochaines trois à quatre années
pour atteindre un niveau national à temps plein. Pour l’instant, vos dons serviront
à financer notre saison 2015-2016 et à fournir un revenu à nos musiciens, donc
créant une opportunité de formation
immédiate pour eux. Nous voulons aussi créer un budget de marketing qui nous permettra de lancer nos
idées aux institutions financières et aux organisations musicales. Il va sans
dire que vos dons montreraient non seulement l’enthousiasme des gens à travers
le Canada envers ce programme mais aussi le besoin!

Les points saillants de notre saison 2015-2016

Cette saison consistera de deux concerts
d’orchestre mettant en vedette des solistes professionnels, dont Axel Strauss
(violon), Matt Haimovitz (violoncelle) et Philip Chiu (piano), qui joueront
ensemble dans le Concerto Triple de Beethoven en mars 2016
Nous avons un évènement spécial qui sera
annoncé sous peu qui mettra en vedette le trompettiste solo de l’Orchestre symphonique
de Montréal, Paul Merkelo!
Le répertoire est sélectionné par notre
directeur artistique, Maestro Alexis Hauser, dépendant de la grandeur de
l’orchestre, de la pertinence aux études orchestrales et de la promotion des
compositeur(e)s canadien(ne)s. Cette année nous présenterons de grandes œuvres,
telles que le Requiem de Fauré, la Suite Pulcinella de Stravinsky et la 8e
symphonie de Beethoven. Pour plus de détails, vous pouvez cliquer ici.
Nos musiciens doivent participer à quatre répétitions
de trois heures en préparation pour chaque concert
Les concerts de musique de chambre sont organisés
au cours de l’année selon la disponibilité et l’initiative de nos musiciens

<h2>Story</h2>
<p>
I'm dilover, pianist and composer. I've been pursuit the way to life for music for more than 10 years. Today I have the chance to do a big step; A record label offers me to play in NYC.
</p>
<p>
I planned a trip to NY in december, saving money in september, october and november. I listed in musician classfields  and a record label called to me for playing in a band.
</p>
<p>
They expected I live in the US, but they didn't care about I live in Chile. 
I have the flight ticket date september 30th wow, so fast!
</p>
<p>
So, I have the flight ticket, the authorization from my boss, the visa and passport, but I haven't enough money for basic needs and emergencies. That's why I'm here asking to you for support to become my dream true and share my music with the world.
</p>
<h2>Budget</h2>
<p>
I need the help of all the fans for falling on one's feet inside NY. My goal is US$3.000 equal to a month of cheap living in Brooklyn. I calculated the amount in the following way:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>US$1.800 | Room.</b>
This is the monthly cost of a cheaper, but safe, room.
</li>
<li>
<b>US$600 | Food.</b>
This is the monthly cost of a daily lunch.
</li>
<li>
<b>US$600 | Marketing.</b>
New York is full of dreamers,so I must stress from head to toe. I never traveled so far, so I must buy everything. Also, this amount will be used to elaborate rewards.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The room and food costs are based in those websites:

</p>
<h2>¿Why should I help?</h2>
<p>
I feel this is the big chance to open wide my diffusion horizons of my music and change these years of bread, noodles and coin salary, for playing for first time outside of my country.
</p>
<p>
The support and vision of my family, friends, work mates, and the beautiful people of Valparaiso, make me feel committed to fulfill my aims.
</p>
<p>
“chances appear once in a lifetime” and “Nothing ventured, nothing gained.”. 
There is just one way to proof I'm right: tripping.
</p>
<p>
Finally, who helps to me will be part of a huge story, count on that!
</p>
<h2>Who am I helping?</h2>
<p>
I'm a secretary and carpenter son. At 13 I play the piano for the very first time, and I fell in love. At age of 16 I have my first keyboard I learned by 
myself.   
</p>
<p>
At age of 14 I was sick of 
<a href=""https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000684.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Guillaín Barré Syndrome</a>.
</p>
<p>
I said to myself I will live for music. But, first I must to prepare the scene. for that I entered to study computer science at 17yo. At 20 I left home.
</p>
<p>
I paid my career and my home, working in the same time as night watchman, butcher, programmer. In parallel I went to university and improved my technique at piano.
</p>
<p>
At 23 my father received a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spHcoV19UFc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">piano (click to see video)</a> from a client, and gave it to me. I done big steps in my technique with this jewel.
</p>
<p>
Then I met to <a href=""http://www.clr.cl/English-Idx-P-CruzHernan.asp?strng=Organ+performers%22%22"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hernán Cruz</a>, affiliated <a href=""https://www.rcmusic.ca/overview"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">RCM</a>'s teacher,

</p>
<p>
Hernán listened my music and decided to help me to improve my technique for a year. At the end of the season, he gave directions for walking in my path as musician. 
</p>
<p>
So today I work in

<h3>SO, DO YOU WANT TO HELP ME ;) ?</h3>
<h1>ESPAÑOL</h1>
<h2>Historia</h2>
<p>
Soy Dilover, pianista y compositor. Desde más de 10 años he estado buscando la manera de vivir de la música. Hoy tengo la chance de dar un gran paso; me han ofrecido tocar en Nueva York.
</p>
<p>
Planeaba un viaje a NY en diciembre, plazo suficiente para ahorrar dinero. En eso, me alisté en los clasificados de músicos y un sello musical me llama para tocar con una banda.
</p>
<p>
Ellos esperaban que viviera en los Estados Unidos, pero no les importó que fuera Chileno, y me han dado el boleto para el 30 de septiembre ¡no esperaba que me llamaran tan rápido!
</p>
<p>
Tengo el boleto, el permiso en mi empleo, la visa y el pasaporte, pero no he ahorrado lo suficiente para cubrir todas las necesidades básicas y emergencias que puedan presentarse.
</p>
<p>
Es por eso que estoy aquí, para pedirles ayuda para concretar mi sueño de vivir de la música y compartirla con el mundo.
</p>
<h2>Campaña &amp; presupuesto</h2>
<p>
Necesito la ayuda de todos los fans para poder caer de pie en NY. La meta es juntar USD$3.000 que equivale a un mes viviendo sin lujos en Brooklyn. He calculado el monto de la siguiente manera:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<b>US$1.800 | Hospedaje.</b>
Este es costo mensual de la habitación más barata, pero segura.
</li>
<li>
<b>US$600 | Comida.</b>
Este es el costo mensual de un almuerzo diario barato.
</li>
<li>
<b>US$600 | Difusión.</b>
Nueva York está lleno de gente que busca hacer realidad sus sueños; así que debo destacar desde la cabeza a los pies. Además como nunca he viajado tan lejos necesito comprar todo. Este monto será usado también para elaborar las recompensas.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Los costos de habitación y comida están basados en los sitios

</p>
<h2>¿Por qué debo ayudar?</h2>
<p>
Siento que esta es la gran oportunidad de ampliar los horizontes de difusión de mi música y cambiar estos años de panes, fideos y monedas por tocar por primera vez fuera de mi país.
</p>
<p>
El apoyo y visión de mi familia, amigos, compañeros de trabajo y la gente de mi querido puerto de Valparaíso, me hace responsable de luchar por mis sueños.
</p>
<p>
“las oportunidades se dan una sola vez en la vida” y “el que no se arriesga, no cruza el río”. Hay una sola forma de comprobar si estoy dando un buen paso: haciendo el viaje.
</p>
<p>
En definitiva, quien me ayude será parte de una gran historia, ¡se los aseguro!
</p>
<h2>¿A quien estoy ayudando?</h2>
<p>
Soy hijo de una secretaria y un carpintero. A los 13 conocí el piano y me enamoré. A los 16 tuve mi primer teclado, el cual aprendí a tocarlo en forma autodidacta. 
</p>

Story

I'm dilover, pianist and composer. I've been pursuit the way to life for music for more than 10 years. Today I have the chance to do a big step; A record label offers me to play in NYC.


I planned a trip to NY in december, saving money in september, october and november. I listed in musician classfields  and a record label called to me for playing in a band.


They expected I live in the US, but they didn't care about I live in Chile. 
I have the flight ticket date september 30th wow, so fast!


So, I have the flight ticket, the authorization from my boss, the visa and passport, but I haven't enough money for basic needs and emergencies. That's why I'm here asking to you for support to become my dream true and share my music with the world.

Budget

I need the help of all the fans for falling on one's feet inside NY. My goal is US$3.000 equal to a month of cheap living in Brooklyn. I calculated the amount in the following way:



US$1.800 | Room.
This is the monthly cost of a cheaper, but safe, room.


US$600 | Food.
This is the monthly cost of a daily lunch.


US$600 | Marketing.
New York is full of dreamers,so I must stress from head to toe. I never traveled so far, so I must buy everything. Also, this amount will be used to elaborate rewards.



The room and food costs are based in those websites:
Expatistan, 
Numbeo,
Airbnb y 
Trip Advisor.

¿Why should I help?

I feel this is the big chance to open wide my diffusion horizons of my music and change these years of bread, noodles and coin salary, for playing for first time outside of my country.


The support and vision of my family, friends, work mates, and the beautiful people of Valparaiso, make me feel committed to fulfill my aims.


“chances appear once in a lifetime” and “Nothing ventured, nothing gained.”. 
There is just one way to proof I'm right: tripping.


Finally, who helps to me will be part of a huge story, count on that!

Who am I helping?

I'm a secretary and carpenter son. At 13 I play the piano for the very first time, and I fell in love. At age of 16 I have my first keyboard I learned by 
myself.   


At age of 14 I was sick of 
Guillaín Barré Syndrome.


I said to myself I will live for music. But, first I must to prepare the scene. for that I entered to study computer science at 17yo. At 20 I left home.


I paid my career and my home, working in the same time as night watchman, butcher, programmer. In parallel I went to university and improved my technique at piano.


At 23 my father received a piano (click to see video) from a client, and gave it to me. I done big steps in my technique with this jewel.


Then I met to Hernán Cruz, affiliated RCM's teacher, 
disciple of  Karl Richter and Julio Pérceval, and Claudio Arrau's friend.


Hernán listened my music and decided to help me to improve my technique for a year. At the end of the season, he gave directions for walking in my path as musician. 


So today I work in  
Café con Grácià as pianist, 
I've invited to several national musician concerts, highlighting Chinoy.

SO, DO YOU WANT TO HELP ME ;) ?
ESPAÑOL
Historia

Soy Dilover, pianista y compositor. Desde más de 10 años he estado buscando la manera de vivir de la música. Hoy tengo la chance de dar un gran paso; me han ofrecido tocar en Nueva York.


Planeaba un viaje a NY en diciembre, plazo suficiente para ahorrar dinero. En eso, me alisté en los clasificados de músicos y un sello musical me llama para tocar con una banda.


Ellos esperaban que viviera en los Estados Unidos, pero no les importó que fuera Chileno, y me han dado el boleto para el 30 de septiembre ¡no esperaba que me llamaran tan rápido!


Tengo el boleto, el permiso en mi empleo, la visa y el pasaporte, pero no he ahorrado lo suficiente para cubrir todas las necesidades básicas y emergencias que puedan presentarse.


Es por eso que estoy aquí, para pedirles ayuda para concretar mi sueño de vivir de la música y compartirla con el mundo.

Campaña & presupuesto

Necesito la ayuda de todos los fans para poder caer de pie en NY. La meta es juntar USD$3.000 que equivale a un mes viviendo sin lujos en Brooklyn. He calculado el monto de la siguiente manera:



US$1.800 | Hospedaje.
Este es costo mensual de la habitación más barata, pero segura.


US$600 | Comida.
Este es el costo mensual de un almuerzo diario barato.


US$600 | Difusión.
Nueva York está lleno de gente que busca hacer realidad sus sueños; así que debo destacar desde la cabeza a los pies. Además como nunca he viajado tan lejos necesito comprar todo. Este monto será usado también para elaborar las recompensas.



Los costos de habitación y comida están basados en los sitios 
Expatistan, 
Numbeo,
Airbnb y 
Trip Advisor.

¿Por qué debo ayudar?

Siento que esta es la gran oportunidad de ampliar los horizontes de difusión de mi música y cambiar estos años de panes, fideos y monedas por tocar por primera vez fuera de mi país.


El apoyo y visión de mi familia, amigos, compañeros de trabajo y la gente de mi querido puerto de Valparaíso, me hace responsable de luchar por mis sueños.


“las oportunidades se dan una sola vez en la vida” y “el que no se arriesga, no cruza el río”. Hay una sola forma de comprobar si estoy dando un buen paso: haciendo el viaje.


En definitiva, quien me ayude será parte de una gran historia, ¡se los aseguro!

¿A quien estoy ayudando?

Soy hijo de una secretaria y un carpintero. A los 13 conocí el piano y me enamoré. A los 16 tuve mi primer teclado, el cual aprendí a tocarlo en forma autodidacta. 


Entre medio a los 14 me enfermé del 
Síndrome de Guillaín Barré.


Dije a mi mismo que viviría de la música. Pero primero tenía que preparar todo para aquello. a los 17 me puse a estudiar informática. A los 20 años decidí irme de casa.


Para costear los estudios y el costo de la vida trabajé de nochero, carnicero, programador al mismo tiempo, y también mejoraba mis destrezas en el piano e iba a la universidad.


A los 23, mi padre me entrega un piano (clic para ver video) que le había sido regalado por uno de sus empleadores. pude mejorar mucho mi técnica usando mi tiempo libre para practicar ya que vivía solo.


Poco después del regalo de mi padre, conozco a Hernán Cruz, profesor afiliado del RCM, 
discípulo de Karl Richter y Julio Pérceval, además de haber sido amigo de Claudio Arrau.


Hernán escucha mis composiciones y decide ayudar a mejorar mi técnica durante un año. Al final de la temporada, me entrega instrucciones para seguir mi camino como músico. 


Desde ese momento me he puesto a trabajar en 
Café con Grácià como pianista, y he sido invitado a distintos conciertos, compartiendo escena con artistas nacionales, destacando a Chinoy.

 Some people just can't contribute  You can help by sharing the campaign on sosial medias. Videos, pictures and links for campaign. Spread the word in your neighborhood, spread it on Facebook, twitter and so on.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

</div></div>","Hello - and thank you for stopping by to find out more about An American Landscape. My name is Laura Melanie Stein-Collins and I have been singing since I could speak, and performing in bars before I was old enough to drink in them.

    An American Landscape is a unique perspective of a woman (moi) who traveled across the country to find  home, community, love, and herself. The songs are a reflection of the changing landscape, looking forward, looking back.

    After decades of singing other peoples songs, I found exciting stories to tell. Having had a great experience previously recording with my former band, Blue Moon Prairie, the idea for a solo CD nagged at me.

  This CD is proof that is is never too late to make your dream a reality. 
The songs are written, the session players are on board - all that is needed is you .   What It Takes to Make a CD:
Not everyone reading this is a musician - so...what are the steps in bringing a CD to market?
This is where the money will go:
Pre-production:


Songwriting - the process of creating the lyrics & music
Arranging - who plays what, where & when
Musicianship - identifying the right musicians to bring the song from idealization to reality.
Rehearsals - playing with the musicians to avoid wasted time in the studio

Recording/Mixing/Mastering:
  Recording the vocal and instrumental tracks.
Once the tracks are recorded, we then ""mix"" each track so the levels are correct (e.g. vocals on top of the instruments, lead instruments ahead of rhythm etc.)
Mastering is a post-production process that prepares the final mix for duplication. 

Printing/Duplication:

Once the final Master is done, it is sent off for the actually CD to be made (duplication).
Graphic design and artwork is submitted for the CD cover and any liner notes

Perqs:
I've spent some time looking at other campaigns and seeing what would be interesting to offer. I'm going to bet you don't need stickers, a ""sweaty headband from the last performance"", or other tschotskes (Yiddish word - Google knows), that gather dust. So I've compiled some thanks you that I think will be fun and not add to your cleaning regime.


The perks will not only include the CD, but you get to sample my other passion - Cooking! My specialty is gourmet vegan cuisine and my fabulous Hatch Green Chile sauce (and recipe!) are available. Even tastier, is the opportunity to let me teach you some of my cooking techniques in your home. 
Like to sing? Can you sing? Doesn't matter - you may get a chance to on the CD~!
A verse written and recorded just for you!
Certain levels also include a house concert. If you have ever attended a house concert, than you know that it is the penultimate way of experiencing a show.
   

Risks & Challenges
My first effort - Stories and Lies, with Blue Moon Prairie, was successful and the process of producing a CD is now familiar and comfortable.I will once again be working with Don Richmond at Howling Dog Recording studios in Alamosa, Colorado. Don is reknown for his musical abilities and recording prowess.
  Some of the challenges may be logistical issues with guest musicians. However, the backup plan involves relying more on Don for instrumentation, and possibly having parts recorded elsewhere and mixing here.
Should the goal not be reached, the CD will be made, however, I may not be able to include the full compliment of songs, will have to scale down the packaging concept (no lyric sheets, use a different packaging type, etc.), and make different choices for photographic and graphic design.


OverFunding: In the event of overfunding:


Bonus tracks
The ability to bring in additional musicians
Expanded packaging (to include complete lyric book)

My name is Ella Tofaeono. I am 16 years old, I attend St. John Paul
II Catholic College in Quakers Hill (formally known as Terra Sancta College). 


I
am currently in Year 12/11 as I am doing pathways due to my demanding basketball
schedule. I train 6-8 sessions a week and currently compete at a national level
for basketball. 


I started playing basketball in 2010 and I was fortunate enough
to have height and skill to have been looked as a future star for basketball in
Australia. 

Basketball

I play representative basketball for the division one under 18 women
and Waratah Championship League (ABA senior women) at Penrith Panthers, I have
represented my school at NSW Combined Catholic Colleges, and I have represented
NSW Metropolitan women three years in a row. 


I was lucky enough to have
performed well at the under 16 Australian National Junior Championships held in
Adelaide 2013 to have earned a spot in the under 17 Australian Squad as a
bottom age athlete where I attended a trial selection camp. 

My Injury

Unfortunately I had
to withdraw from the NSW Women's Metropolitan State program this year after
sustaining a knee injury. 


I have also had to put important basketball pathways
such as National Intensive Training Program, National Players Program and
Sydney Flames Development Academy on hold. 


I have been diagnosed with an
osteochondral lesion over my medial trochlea which is pretty much cartilage
damage amongst the main bones in my knee. This injury requires an arthroscopy
procedure and intense rehabilitation/physio. 

What your donation means to me:

My goals for after the surgery is
to have a speedy recovery and be able to compete in other important basketball
events throughout 2015 at 110 %.


 My goals for the future are to represent
Australia at a World Championship or an Olympics, play in the Women's National
Basketball League and Women's National Basketball Association and to study a
degree in Exercise Physiology. 


Not only that but growing up in Western Sydney
has given me the motivation to persist with my studies and basketball as I want
to be an inspiration for Polynesian kids in the area to work hard at school and
sport. 


I also want to be able to support my family as they have persevered and
worked hard to get me to where I am today.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p><span>In a few short years, Ms. ANNIKA CHAMBERS has rapidly risen to be one of Houston’s</span><span> local favorite Blues artists. </span><span>She has captured the heart</span><span>s</span><span> of both Blues and non-Blues fans alike with </span><span>her natural vocal talent, powerful energy, and vivacious stage presence.  Annika</span><span> Chambers</span><span> was named </span><span>Houston Press</span><span> “Female Vocalist of the Year” in 2013, and she is currently nominated for a 2015 Blues Artist Award in the “Best New Artist” category with her band, The Houston All-Stars. </span><span>She has become a favorite of Houston Mayor </span><span>Annis</span><span>e</span><span> Parker, she sang America the Beautiful for Citizenship month in 2013 and was on the float in 2014 for the </span><b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Houst</span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">on Thanksgiving Parade. </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Annika was also recently honored with first SWAN (Support Women Artist Now) award by Houston SAG-AFTRA Conservatory and Women in Film Houston.</span></b></p>
<p><span>Annika Chambers’ debut album, “Making My Mark” was nominated for Best Blues in Houston by the Sammy awards.This notable CD has</span><span> also</span><span> ranked on the following Blues charts. </span></p>
<ul>
<li><p><span>#16 On Living Blues Charts</span></p></li>
<li><p><span>#1 ""Bakers Dozen""  Blues411.com</span></p></li>
<li><p><span>#20 Roots Music Report</span></p></li>
<li><p><span>#10 Bluesdebut.com</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p><span>As much as we would like to keep our Annika Chambers all to ourselves here in Houston</span><span>, Annika</span><span> has a true,</span><span> God-given gift that is meant to be shared with the world.  She is </span><span>rapidly </span><span>reaching a ceiling here in Houston in her ability to grow</span><span> professionally and personally</span><span> as an artist.  Her recent performance at the 2015 SXSW in Austin was met with rave reviews, and Annika continues to</span><span> receive invitations, make connections, and</span><span> broaden her potential for greater opportunities on the road. </span></p>
<p><span>Annika Chambers is driven, motivated, ambitious, and hard-working as an artist.  Besides playing regularly in her own performances around town, she is often seen around town as a guest vocalist for many of </span><span>our </span><span>other local favorite Blues artists.  In addition, to playing her music gigs, Annika</span><span> and her </span><span>band</span><span>mates</span><span> volunteer regu</span><span>larly performing for children in</span><span> local hospitals and playing at benefits for other local music artists and their family members. </span></p>
<p><span>After her dedicated </span><span> 7 ½ year </span><span>tour of</span><span> active duty in the US Army and then earning her degree in radio and TV broadcasting</span><span>, Annika is now able to focus on</span><span> her music career full</span><span>-</span><span>time, and she is ready to take on the world! </span></p>
<p><span>The only real way that an artist can move to the next level professionally is to take the band “ON THE ROAD!”</span><span> We all know this to be true. </span><span>We also know that a musician’s reimbursement package for playing locally does not </span><span>sufficien</span><span>tly fund major purchases like a “</span><span>Tour Van</span><span>,”  A decent</span><span>, reliable</span><span> Tour  Van </span><span>would allow Annika and her band to pursue their dream to take the music on the road safely and reliably. </span></p>
<p><span>Please listen to Annika’s special, heartfelt video message above and see her personal note below: </span></p>
<p><span>Hey y'all </span></p>
<p><span>First</span><span> of all, I would like to </span><span>thank you </span><span>from my heart</span><span> for taking the time to read through our campaign. </span><span> It is not easy asking for money as someone who considers herself to be a</span><span> dedicated, </span><span>independent woman</span><span> who </span><span>is used to standing</span><span> proudly on my two feet.  I am no stranger to hard work and giving it all both to my music and to my community.  Anyone who knows me knows that I BELIEVE IN THE PRINCIPLE OF “GIVING BACK.” </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>However, my band and I are on the brink of so many opportunities, and</span><span> WE NEED YOUR HELP! </span><span>  As most of you know, it is a huge dream for me and my stellar band to travel across the country sharing our music with the world.  The only thing holding us back is RELIABLE TRANSPORTATION for us and our music equipment. </span><span>As many of you know, Paul Ramirez and I were stranded las</span><span>t year in Arizona with a broken-</span><span>down vehicle.  With your help</span><span> then</span><span>, we made it home</span><span> after a few days of pure stress</span><span>!! </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Today, I am ask</span><span>i</span><span>ng for your help again to support our music. </span><span>I sincerely hope that you can help our cause. </span></p>

In a few short years, Ms. ANNIKA CHAMBERS has rapidly risen to be one of Houston’s local favorite Blues artists. She has captured the hearts of both Blues and non-Blues fans alike with her natural vocal talent, powerful energy, and vivacious stage presence.  Annika Chambers was named Houston Press “Female Vocalist of the Year” in 2013, and she is currently nominated for a 2015 Blues Artist Award in the “Best New Artist” category with her band, The Houston All-Stars. She has become a favorite of Houston Mayor Annise Parker, she sang America the Beautiful for Citizenship month in 2013 and was on the float in 2014 for the Houston Thanksgiving Parade. Annika was also recently honored with first SWAN (Support Women Artist Now) award by Houston SAG-AFTRA Conservatory and Women in Film Houston.
Annika Chambers’ debut album, “Making My Mark” was nominated for Best Blues in Houston by the Sammy awards.This notable CD has also ranked on the following Blues charts. 

#16 On Living Blues Charts
#1 ""Bakers Dozen""  Blues411.com
#20 Roots Music Report
#10 Bluesdebut.com

As much as we would like to keep our Annika Chambers all to ourselves here in Houston, Annika has a true, God-given gift that is meant to be shared with the world.  She is rapidly reaching a ceiling here in Houston in her ability to grow professionally and personally as an artist.  Her recent performance at the 2015 SXSW in Austin was met with rave reviews, and Annika continues to receive invitations, make connections, and broaden her potential for greater opportunities on the road. 
Annika Chambers is driven, motivated, ambitious, and hard-working as an artist.  Besides playing regularly in her own performances around town, she is often seen around town as a guest vocalist for many of our other local favorite Blues artists.  In addition, to playing her music gigs, Annika and her bandmates volunteer regularly performing for children in local hospitals and playing at benefits for other local music artists and their family members. 
After her dedicated  7 ½ year tour of active duty in the US Army and then earning her degree in radio and TV broadcasting, Annika is now able to focus on her music career full-time, and she is ready to take on the world! 
The only real way that an artist can move to the next level professionally is to take the band “ON THE ROAD!” We all know this to be true. We also know that a musician’s reimbursement package for playing locally does not sufficiently fund major purchases like a “Tour Van,”  A decent, reliable Tour  Van would allow Annika and her band to pursue their dream to take the music on the road safely and reliably. 
Please listen to Annika’s special, heartfelt video message above and see her personal note below: 
Hey y'all 
First of all, I would like to thank you from my heart for taking the time to read through our campaign.  It is not easy asking for money as someone who considers herself to be a dedicated, independent woman who is used to standing proudly on my two feet.  I am no stranger to hard work and giving it all both to my music and to my community.  Anyone who knows me knows that I BELIEVE IN THE PRINCIPLE OF “GIVING BACK.” 

However, my band and I are on the brink of so many opportunities, and WE NEED YOUR HELP!   As most of you know, it is a huge dream for me and my stellar band to travel across the country sharing our music with the world.  The only thing holding us back is RELIABLE TRANSPORTATION for us and our music equipment. As many of you know, Paul Ramirez and I were stranded last year in Arizona with a broken-down vehicle.  With your help then, we made it home after a few days of pure stress!! 

Today, I am asking for your help again to support our music. I sincerely hope that you can help our cause. 

We are asking your donationto help purchase our first reliable TOUR VAN. 
Our perks for your donation range from a signed CD to an “all-access pass” for six months to our shows. 

We also have some cool surprise perks for our FIRST 20 MUSIC TOUR BACKERS!!!
It's tough asking for money but I'm putting my pride aside and asking.
If you truly can't help us, PLEASE share this with your friends!!
THANK YOU IN ADVANCE!!!! 
Annika

<li>For two years, Hannah Frank Group has hosted ""Singing for Your Supper"", a monthly songwriter showcase in Rogers Park where we've welcomed hundreds of songwriters and musicians to share their music. On First Tuesdays, this has built community in the songwriter scene and provided fans with some great entertainment, for free!</li>

<p>In addition to being in my own band (which is pretty necessary, I suppose),  I'm also a Publicist for the international podcast Chicago Acoustic Underground, and it's record label, CAUDog Records.

<h3>Projet : Faire un bébé ""solidaire""... <br/>
</h3>
<p><i>(You will find hereunder the translation to english) </i><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Bonjour à toutes et à tous, <br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Je m'appelle Sarah. J'ai 32 ans. Et je souffre d'endométriose. Cette maladie me rend infertile et m'empêche de devenir Maman naturellement... <br/></p>
<p>Cette maladie ne vous dit peut-être rien, alors voici quelques explications... <br/></p>
<p>Découverte il y a plus d'un siècle, <b>incurable</b>, touchant <b>2 femmes sur 10 </b>dans le monde, cette maladie gynécologique reste pourtant méconnue, ses origines ne sont à ce jour pas identifiées, et la pathologie met en moyenne <b>6 à 7 ans à être diagnostiquée</b>... Pendant ce temps, elle fait des <b>ravages</b>... <b>Physiques</b> et <b>psychologiques</b>, <b>irréversibles</b>. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>L'endométriose</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<h4>
<i>Qu'est-ce que l'endométriose ? </i><br/>
</h4>
<p>L'endométriose se caractérise par la présence anormale de fragments d'endomètre (tissus qui tapissent la cavité utérine) ou endométriomes, à l'extérieur de l'utérus. Pour les femmes non atteintes, lorsque l'ovule n'est pas fécondé, l'endomètre est éliminé durant les règles puis renouvelé. Lorsque l'on est atteinte d'endométriose, ces tissus se 
développent à l'intérieur et à l'extérieur de l'utérus, et ne 
peuvent être évacués... Des <b>segments d'endomètre viennent alors se greffer et se nécroser</b> en dehors de l'utérus, sur des organes génitaux comme le corps de l'utérus ou les ovaires, mais également non génitaux comme le péritoine, membrane tapissant la paroi abdominale ou le rectum. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4>
<i>Comment se manifeste-t-elle et quelles sont ses conséquences ? </i><br/>

<h3>L'endométriose et moi</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p>En 2011, j'ai décidé de concevoir un enfant avec mon partenaire. J'ai donc arrêté de prendre ma pilule. Très rapidement, des douleurs très importantes et tous les symptômes listés ci-dessus sont apparus, et bébé n'est pas venu... Nous avons consulté plusieurs gynécologues qui, comme pour nombre de mes ""Endosisters"" ont jugé que le problème était psychologique, les kystes bénins, et mes douleurs exagérées... <br/></p>
<p>Jusqu'au jour où, en 2012, j'ai rencontré un ostéopathe dans le cadre de notre envie de procréer... Celui-ci a détecté la maladie et m'a envoyé chez un gynécologue spécialisé en Endométriose. Quelques jours plus tard, je rencontrais ce spécialiste, le diagnostic était posé. Sur le moment, je n'ai pas paniqué. Pour moi c'était un peu comme une MST bénigne, un petit traitement médicamenteux allait tout régler. Mais 1 mois plus tard j'étais opérée d'urgence. Les kystes étaient tellement gros qu'ils avaient pris la place des ovaires et les avaient endommagés, tout comme ma vessie, mon utérus, et mon colon. Après l'opération, je me pensais guérie, et je croyais que les problèmes étaient derrière moi... Mais quelques mois/années après, j'ai compris que la maladie ferait désormais partie de ma vie. Mon partenaire et moi avons tout essayé ou presque pour faire notre bébé, mais rien n'y a fait... <br/></p>
<p>2013, je n'ai plus de partenaire (car la maladie ne détruit malheureusement pas que le corps), mais toujours cette envie profonde, sincère et viscérale de donner la vie moi aussi... J'attends de trouver l'Homme de ma vie... <br/></p>
<p>Et puis début 2014, mon gynécologue m'annonce qu'<b>il ne me reste qu'1 à 2 ans devant moi si je veux un jour porter un enfant</b>... J'ai besoin de temps pour réfléchir, pour trouver des solutions... Pendant ce temps, je suis placée sous ""ménopause artificielle"", afin de mettre la maladie en sommeil quelque temps... <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Un bébé, malgré l'endométriose...</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Aujourd'hui en 2015, j'ai 32 ans, 4 ans se sont écoulés depuis que le diagnostic a été posé ; 1 an et demi se sont déroulés depuis l'annonce ""ultimatum"" de mon gynécologue, je suis toujours célibataire, et il n'est pas dans mes convictions de faire un enfant avec un homme de passage (chose qui serait d'ailleurs impossible puisque je ne peux pas concevoir un enfant naturellement). Le temps passe, le mien passe plus vite, et je ne veux pas laisser ma vie défiler sous mes yeux sans rien tenter. </p>
<p><b>C'est pourquoi aujourd'hui je vous demande de l'aide... Ma seule chance de concevoir un enfant est de passer par une ""FIV DO"" (Fécondation In Vitro à partir de mes ovules, avec un DOnneur de sperme anonyme). </b>Cela n'est pas autorisé en France pour une personne célibataire, mais les gynécologues français ont l'habitude de travailler avec des cliniques spécialisées, en Espagne et en Belgique... C'est ce qui m'a été conseillé. <br/></p>
<p>Après renseignements auprès de différentes cliniques, je sais que <b>chaque tentative coûte en moyenne 5000€</b>... Ce prix comprenant la visite préalable à la Clinique, les traitements hormonaux et les divers examens (non remboursés par la Sécurité Sociale française), l'acte de FIV en lui-même, les soins pré et post-intervention, les trajets et l'hébergement sur place (j'habite à Montpellier) durant les jours précédant et suivant l'intervention... <br/></p>
<p>A ce jour, je n'ai pas réussi à réunir cette somme à moi-seule... J'ai cherché comment faire pour y arriver, j'ai travaillé plus, j'ai dépensé moins, j'ai économisé... Et pourtant... Et un jour, alors qu'une amie lançait un projet de Crowdfunding, je me suis dit ""Tiens, si je faisais la même chose pour concevoir mon bébé !""... Au départ, j'avoue que l'idée m'a semblé un peu ""saugrenue""... Et puis j'ai réfléchi et je me suis dit que <b>ce serait si beau de faire cet enfant seule, mais avec vous tous... Quelle belle histoire que serait celle de mon enfant... Et quelle belle valeur il porterait en lui : la SOLIDARITE... </b><br/></p>
<p>Je suis donc très fière de vous présenter mon projet... Et j'espère de tout cœur que vous me soutiendrez dans ma démarche... <br/></p>
<p>Je vous remercie sincèrement de m'avoir lue et de l'intérêt que vous portez à mon projet. Et je vous remercie par avance pour votre participation généreuse et solidaire. Surtout ne soyez pas gêné de ne pas pouvoir donner, ou de ne pouvoir faire qu'une maigre contribution, les temps sont durs pour tout le monde... Je suis preneuse de tout soutien, moral, matériel ou financier, quelle qu'en soit la hauteur... </p>
<p>Surtout n'hésitez pas à me contacter si vous voulez en savoir plus, et n'hésitez pas non plus à partager au maximum ! <b>MERCI</b> !</p>

Bonjour à toutes et à tous, 


Je m'appelle Sarah. J'ai 32 ans. Et je souffre d'endométriose. Cette maladie me rend infertile et m'empêche de devenir Maman naturellement... 
Cette maladie ne vous dit peut-être rien, alors voici quelques explications... 
Découverte il y a plus d'un siècle, incurable, touchant 2 femmes sur 10 dans le monde, cette maladie gynécologique reste pourtant méconnue, ses origines ne sont à ce jour pas identifiées, et la pathologie met en moyenne 6 à 7 ans à être diagnostiquée... Pendant ce temps, elle fait des ravages... Physiques et psychologiques, irréversibles. 

L'endométriose


Qu'est-ce que l'endométriose ? 

L'endométriose se caractérise par la présence anormale de fragments d'endomètre (tissus qui tapissent la cavité utérine) ou endométriomes, à l'extérieur de l'utérus. Pour les femmes non atteintes, lorsque l'ovule n'est pas fécondé, l'endomètre est éliminé durant les règles puis renouvelé. Lorsque l'on est atteinte d'endométriose, ces tissus se 
développent à l'intérieur et à l'extérieur de l'utérus, et ne 
peuvent être évacués... Des segments d'endomètre viennent alors se greffer et se nécroser en dehors de l'utérus, sur des organes génitaux comme le corps de l'utérus ou les ovaires, mais également non génitaux comme le péritoine, membrane tapissant la paroi abdominale ou le rectum. 


Comment se manifeste-t-elle et quelles sont ses conséquences ? 

Les symptômes de la maladie sont très invalidants sur le plan physique, mais également psychique et social : 
- Présence d'endométriomes plus ou moins importants, détruisant entièrement ou partiellement, de manière définitive certains organes... ,
- Dysménorrhées (douleurs intenses précédant, accompagnant et suivant les règles),
- Dyschésies ou diarrhées (difficultés et douleurs intenses à la défécation), rectorragies, 
- Troubles urinaires (douleurs et brûlures lors de la miction, difficultés à vider la vessie ou hématurie),
- Dyspareunie (douleurs intenses pendant les rapports sexuels),
- Douleurs pelviennes très intenses, provoquant des bouffées de chaleur, une incapacité partielle ou totale à se mouvoir, des nausées voire des vomissements, des vertiges, des spasmes voire des convulsions, et parfois des pertes de connaissance, 
- Une fatigue chronique,
- Un isolement subi (incompréhension de l'entourage quant à la maladie, impossibilité d'honorer certains rendez-vous personnels et professionnels, etc) et un grand sentiment d'impuissance menant à la dépression, 
- L'infertilité voire la stérilité. 


Quels sont les traitements ? 

Il n'en existe pas. Cette maladie est aujourd'hui incurable et évolutive. Elle s’aggrave à chaque période de règles. 
Les seules alternatives à ce jour sont : des opérations très invasives et répétées par cœlioscopie (lors desquelles le chirurgien va vous enlever les endométriomes, kystes qui reviendront progressivement et implacablement à chaque menstruations...), et un traitement de ménopause artificielle (ce ""traitement"" vous empêche juste d'avoir vos règles et donc d’aggraver la maladie, mais il ne la soigne pas).

Dana hails from Detroit but now calls Nashville home after seven years in LA.

<p>On her self-titled self-released second solo CD,
the six instrumentals rock with a funky edge. Vocals
on the other five tracks are by McClinton, Jimmy

This, I find, is a stunning second solo album from the excellent saxophonist Dana Robbins and it features vocals from Delbert McClinton and Jimmy Hall. Long overdue a review. Dana hails from Detroit but now calls Nashville home after seven years in LA. She has played with John Mayall, Frank Zappa, James Brown and Steve Cropper amongst so many others and is a very highly rated and in demand player.(see full review on my website)____________________________________________________________________________AQUARIAN WEEKLY RANT N' ROLL     http://www.theaquarian.com/2014/08/20/rant-n-roll-dana-sean-orrin-the-rev/

On her self-titled self-released second solo CD,
the six instrumentals rock with a funky edge. Vocals
on the other five tracks are by McClinton, Jimmy
Hall (remember Southern rock’s Wet Willie?) and,
making her vocal debut, Robbins herself.

""The name Dana Robbins may not be familiar to you, but its almost certain you've heard her burnished work on saxophone, flute and piccolo on other artists' albums.""

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>Lance Carpenter EP presale and other cool stuff...</h3> <p>Hey y'all, thanks for checking out my indiegogo campaign.  I am so excited for you to hear some new music... you've been asking for it...and it's almost here!!!  </p>
<p>Before I start talking about my project I want you to know that this is not me asking you to fund my project.  This is just your chance to pre-order my EP and have the opportunity to score some other cool stuff like merch packages, special collectors items, and one on one experience's that I wouldn't be able to offer without this campaign.  </p>
<p>Each of YOU are so important to me!!!   Without you I would not have a career with my music so I want you to be as involved with my music and this process as I can.  </p> </div> <div> <h3>My goal says $5,000...but I want to be 100% transparent and break down my estimated expenses to you for this project so you know this money won't be going into my pocket...</h3> <ul> <li>Tracking - $5,400</li>
<li>Vocal recording - $600</li>
<li>Mixing - $1,000</li>
<li>Mastering - $400</li>
<li>graphics/photography - $400</li>
<li>Duplication - $1,500</li>
<li>i'm sure i'm forgetting something but I just wanted to let you in on the $ side of things....</li> </ul>
<div>So that's a little under $10,000 to get this EP recorded and in your hands!!!  So this is my way of involving you so let's make that process FUN!!!</div>
<div></div>
</div><h3>The Songs...</h3><div>I can tell you I am recording 6 songs...5 that I co-wrote with some amazing folks, and 1 song that I did not write...i repeat... DID NOT WRITE.  I discovered this song a few years ago and didn't think i'd be able to record it but I am beyond blessed that we made that happen.  As we get closer to the release date I will reveal the track listing, cover art, and other details.  I can tell you that I recored the music for the project at Jay Demarcus's house (Rascal Flatts). Jay is such a nice and I am blessed he allowed me to bring this project to life in his studio.  </div><div>
<h3>Looking back..and looking forward...</h3> <p>A few years ago, I recorded my first project and used a platform like this to raise the money for the project.  I can't thank y'all enough for making that happen!!!  It was a dream come true to release my first album and I can't wait for you to hear this new project and see what the impact is going to be.  </p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact...</h3>Just to let you know...i've had fans come up to me after shows and tell me how much they love my music but more than that...how a specific song has brightened their day, has helped them get over a break, has comforted them through a divorce an in at least one case helped a couple work through their differences and make their marriage work and they say they've never been happier.   Songs from my first album have been played at weddings and have even been the first dance for a few couples, it's made people laugh and reconnect with old friends.  The impact my music has made on these folks WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED WITHOUT YOU... Yeah i recorded and sang the songs but you have just as much ownership in this positive impact as I do.  It makes me wonder what kind of impact this new project can have!!!</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Short on funds...Other Ways You Can Help...</h3> <p>I understand that not everyone has extra money laying around to spend on things like this but if you want to help here are a few things you can do that would be equally appreciated:</p> <ul> <li>SPREAD THE WORD....Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about my campaign with indiegogo share tools and social media</li> <li>FIND ME...on social media, Facebook, twitter, instagram, youtube...and share those pages with your friends and family so they can discover my music.  </li>
<li>EMAIL....for those of you who still use it, send a personal email to your close friends and family with links to this campaign and my social media links and website.</li> </ul> </div> <p>And that's all there is to it ...Love y'all</p><p>Developed with a Southern accent!!!  </p></div>","Lance Carpenter EP presale and other cool stuff...

Each of YOU are so important to me!!!   Without you I would not have a career with my music so I want you to be as involved with my music and this process as I can.     My goal says $5,000...but I want to be 100% transparent and break down my estimated expenses to you for this project so you know this money won't be going into my pocket...  Tracking - $5,400
Vocal recording - $600
Mixing - $1,000
Mastering - $400
graphics/photography - $400
Duplication - $1,500
i'm sure i'm forgetting something but I just wanted to let you in on the $ side of things.... 
So that's a little under $10,000 to get this EP recorded and in your hands!!!  So this is my way of involving you so let's make that process FUN!!!

The Songs...I can tell you I am recording 6 songs...5 that I co-wrote with some amazing folks, and 1 song that I did not write...i repeat... DID NOT WRITE.  I discovered this song a few years ago and didn't think i'd be able to record it but I am beyond blessed that we made that happen.  As we get closer to the release date I will reveal the track listing, cover art, and other details.  I can tell you that I recored the music for the project at Jay Demarcus's house (Rascal Flatts). Jay is such a nice and I am blessed he allowed me to bring this project to life in his studio.  
Looking back..and looking forward... A few years ago, I recorded my first project and used a platform like this to raise the money for the project.  I can't thank y'all enough for making that happen!!!  It was a dream come true to release my first album and I can't wait for you to hear this new project and see what the impact is going to be.  

The Impact...Just to let you know...i've had fans come up to me after shows and tell me how much they love my music but more than that...how a specific song has brightened their day, has helped them get over a break, has comforted them through a divorce an in at least one case helped a couple work through their differences and make their marriage work and they say they've never been happier.   Songs from my first album have been played at weddings and have even been the first dance for a few couples, it's made people laugh and reconnect with old friends.  The impact my music has made on these folks WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED WITHOUT YOU... Yeah i recorded and sang the songs but you have just as much ownership in this positive impact as I do.  It makes me wonder what kind of impact this new project can have!!!
    Short on funds...Other Ways You Can Help... I understand that not everyone has extra money laying around to spend on things like this but if you want to help here are a few things you can do that would be equally appreciated:  SPREAD THE WORD....Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about my campaign with indiegogo share tools and social media FIND ME...on social media, Facebook, twitter, instagram, youtube...and share those pages with your friends and family so they can discover my music.  
EMAIL....for those of you who still use it, send a personal email to your close friends and family with links to this campaign and my social media links and website.   And that's all there is to it ...Love y'allDeveloped with a Southern accent!!!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

When we began this project 7 years ago, it was our mission to develop a professional-level concert band in which players would be paid per service in a manner similar to professional orchestras.  Currently, there is not one civilian, full-time, professional wind band in America. We estimate that there are between 30 to 40 million people in our country who have taken band sometime during their lives. Even if only a fraction of those numbers would still be interested, there would be a strong market for professional bands. For us, the cost of putting on a concert usually requires all of the proceeds coming from ticket sales, leaving us nothing to use for marketing, music purchasing and staffing. Without successful marketing, we will not be able to get ahead of our expenses enough to develop an  image or brand that would help to secure more patronage, sponsorships and to sell more tickets.</p>
<p>This crowdfunding proposal is intended to find supporters of bands and music who would be willing to contribute to the marketing and operational needs of the Florida Wind Band. Of the fundraising goal, 50% will be used to develop and execute a marketing strategy (including a marketing director) that would gain more positive exposure for the FWB. 10% would be used to purchase music for future concerts, and the other 40% would be used to fund a staff member responsible for the development (fundraising) efforts of the band.  If we are unable to reach our goal, the funds would be applied first to marketing (up to $10,000), then to the hiring of development staff  (up to $8,000) and finally to purchasing music ($2,000).<br/></p>
<p>Our band enriches the lives of those who attend the concerts. We have been received so positively that every performance has earned a standing ovation. The existence of a highly successful professional band is only going to enhance the position of bands in secondary schools. The FWB would serve as a model of quality for area bands, would provide in-school clinical services, and would create additional income for professional musicians in the Tampa Bay area who are constantly looking for opportunities to perform. Perhaps the biggest perk for the musicians is that the professional band would be able to perform wind band masterpieces at the highest level for people who love the wind band medium. <br/></p>
<p>Each dollar contributed will move the Florida Wind Band closer to the time when we would be able to generate sufficient funding from ticket sales, patronage and from the sponsorship of businesses in the Tampa Bay region. Without your support, we will continue to be locked in a cycle of performing a concert, paying the expenses of that concert, and then planning for the next concert with $0 with which to work.</p>
<p>This is an outstanding opportunity for those folks who support the existence and educational effectiveness of bands to fund a next logical step in the evolution of the band movement. </p>
<p>Our most immediate concert is on June 29, 2015 entitled ""Land of the Free, Home of the Brave."" It will occur in the Concert Hall at the University of South Florida School of Music at 7:30 pm. Tickets are available through Ticketmaster.</p>

<h3><b>Hi
there!</b></h3>
<p>I'd
like to invite you to help make history by supporting the start of
what will hopefully become a new paradigm: soundtracks for novels!</p>
<p>This one is for my upcoming young adult sci-fi / fantasy novel, Edge - a dark-ish love story involving liminal beings who walk the edges between dimensions, and that also takes a rather unusual perspective on climate change.<br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>This soundtrack is not music in an eBook.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>It's
not meant to be listened to while you're reading the book.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>It's
a closely connected but separate music project.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>It's
basically like the soundtrack (NOT score) for a film.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<h4>It's
an album of amazing music that aligns with and enhances the
atmosphere of the book, but also stands just fine on its own.</h4>
<p>
</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<h4>It's said that stories are how we understand our world, and that right now we're in need of some new stories.</h4>
<h4>Edge is a story of a radically transforming world - including a more compassionate post-meat world - and is my gift to that world. This soundtrack is a crucial part of that gift. <br/>
</h4>
<h4>It will help reach people's hearts - where change begins.<br/>

<p>
</p>
<p>Sharing
great music has always been a passion of mine. I can’t
tell you how excited I am to introduce you to my soundtrack artists
(below) and share their phenomenal music with all of you. I'm honored and humbled that they want to be
a part of it.<br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I'm
just the vehicle for this project, which has taken on a life of its
own.</p>
<p>But
I'm honored to be the facilitator and coordinator.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Let’s
make a soundtrack together!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>-CJK</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>WHY
SOUNDTRACK A NOVEL?</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>The
idea is that the music will help you feel for the story and the story
will help you feel the music.</p>
<p>The
two will cross-promote one another.</p>
<p>It's
a rough market these days for indie writers and musicians - which
is exactly why soundtracking novels could become an important new
paradigm.</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>The music helps with writing (I've actually written some scenes for
songs!)</li>
<li>The music helps to emotionally bond readers with the story, and vice
versa</li>
<li>The soundtrack expands the venue options for concerts, book tours, and especially
combination performances, and provides an unusual “hook” to help
music artists get shows - and authors get talks.<br/>
</li>
<li>It
expands promo reach – reaching the audience of every project artist
instead of just one person.</li>
<li>This crowdfunding campaign provides additional publicity for all</li>
<li>The project connects artists and creates a community of mutual
support</li>
<li>It's FUN!</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>For
the author, for the music artists, and for you our audience – it's
a WIN – WIN – WIN!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>THE
TEAM</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>My soundtrack
artists will have a basic contract and will retain the rights to
their songs.</p>
<p>Each
soundtrack artist will receive some CDs to give away or sell, as they
wish.</p>
<p>They
will have the option of purchasing future CDs at cost, to sell and
keep the money.</p>
<p>If
the soundtrack and novel do well, I hope to set up some future
combination music / book tours with soundtrack artists who are
interested.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>THE
$ GOAL $</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>This
might look like a lot of money, but a lot of it goes away before it
even gets to us, via Indiegogo commissions and taxes.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>If
we hit the goal we get a LOT better deal on Indiegogo commission
(paying only 4% as opposed to 9%).  This
means much more of your pledge goes to supporting the project instead
of paying fees.</b></p>
<p>So
here's hoping you can help us hit the goal!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I
don't believe in asking music artists to work for free and hopefully
you don't either. These artists have poured their hearts and souls
and piggy banks into their music. Many have written or adjusted songs
especially for this soundtrack. This Indiegogo is in part to
compensate them a little for their time and talent. Since there are
17 of them, it adds up.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>But,
17 artists translates to nearly 75 minutes of wonderfully diverse yet unified
music for your ears and soul and imagination. That's a lot of bang for the buck!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The
money is also needed to cover the costs of mastering and
manufacturing the CD, rewards, and shipping. I also hope to make at
least one music video for a soundtrack song, since this would be
invaluable for promoting the soundtrack and the artists on it.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>If
you would like to see the actual nitty gritty project budget, just
drop me an email at <u><a href=""mailto:edgethenovel@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">edgethenovel@gmail.com</a></u>
and I'll be happy to provide it.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>FAQs</h3>
<p>
</p>
<h4>If
we don't hit the goal will we still make the soundtrack?</h4>
<p>Yes
– even if only as a digital.</p>
<p>But
then I might have to ask the artists to work for free :(</p>
<p>And
it could get kinda demoralizing, depending. Let's not go there!</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4>If
we only raise enough money to release the soundtrack in digital form,
will folks who pledged for a real CD still get it?</h4>
<p>Yes.
The cost of making those, and all the rewards, is built into the
pledges even if worst came to worst. And, actually, they would be
even more valuable at that point because there would be far fewer of
them!</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4>If
we exceed the goal, what will we do with the extra money?</h4>
<p>The
plan is to use that money to make music videos for more of the songs,
which will boost promotion of the project, provide additional
exposure for artists, and give you the audience some extra sweetness.
Additionally, I'll be using those videos to help deliver some of the
critical messages of the novel (climate change, environment, homelessness, etc.) at a deep emotional level... using
them as a vehicle for positive transformation in the world.</p>

<h3>THE
REWARDS!</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>We've
put together some kickass rewards, some of them one of a kind that
will only and ever be available HERE and NOW.</p>
<p><b>AND
WE'LL BE ADDING MORE AS THE CAMPAIGN CONTINUES.</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Just
think: these soundtrack artists are achieving new levels even as you read. Some
may break out before this soundtrack even releases. These
rewards could end up being hot items in the near future!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>The
soundtrack CD itself is going to be a special, super sweet Indiegogo
version. We'll be doing a limited run with exclusive artwork. </b>Any
future manufacturing runs will have different artwork. (More on this coming in the days ahead!)<br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>If you
want to collect more than one reward (and of course you do), that's
great too!</p>
<p>And if you wish to support this project in other ways beyond or aside from this Indiegogo, we're open to considering that - drop us an email.<br/></p>

<p>A
Berlin singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist who has been
involved in various music projects and is currently working solo.
She's inspired by nature and is “drawn to the darker issues of
life, exploring edges, filling the gap of the unknown.” The dark
intricate mystery of her music slinks into the soul. Her underworld
siren voice and overall haunting sound will be so welcome on the Edge
soundtrack that I'm going to try and squeeze in a second song from

<p>A
quite unique Berlin/London based indie-electronic producer/songwriter
and multi-instrumentalist, who has played around the UK including
Glastonbury Festival, the TT motorbike festival and numerous concerts
for Rock Against Racism. She's also played Florida and New York,
including a show at the famous Trash Bar and for ZombieCon. Keen to
delve into electronic music, she moved to Berlin to soak up the vibes
and to work on new material. Using a combination of Ableton Live,
guitar and micro Korg, she has successfully blended her passion for
electronic music with the raw sound of her roots, creating something
unique which many find hard to pinpoint.</p>
<p>In
2014, she recorded and produced her debut solo album in London. She
says, ""I was inspired by <em>Rainer
Maria Rilke</em>'s,
'Letters to a young poet' and wanted to write an honest album
reflecting the events of that period.” She is currently in Berlin,
pursuing her interest in instrumental music and working on movie and
video game scoring and a new instrumental album, and was just signed
to a label.</p>

performed in the northwest for years. His musical style ranges from
blues to folk to classic rock, and some songs that are indefinably
all his own. He's been playing piano and guitar since his early teens
and in later years performed on Public Access and ITV in Seattle. In
2006 he signed a three-year publishing contract that garnered him
substantial airplay in Belgium and across the Netherlands, and is
currently playing at SeaTac Airport. Steve says, “Music has always

<p>Hell
Mary is the alter ego of Seattle Indie Folk artist, Rachel Mary Helen
Angerman. “Hell Mary embodies the duality of my nature. It’s a
way to symbolize the darkness and light that lives within us all.”
When I think of her I think of ravens; I suspect that may be her
totem spirit. She's just finished her debut EP “Worship Games” and will be touring the west coast this summer.<br/></p>
<p>On the Edge
soundtrack, she will be performing a duet, paired with the smokey
baritone of twinflame Patrick Galactic - solo acoustic artist and
frontman for the electro-punk trio Death By Stars.  Bathed in reverb and echo, Galactic’s work 
blends the weary introspection of Leonard Cohen, Nick Cave, and the 
Velvet Underground with the pop sensibilities of David Bowie, Elliot 
Smith and Harry Nilsson.<br/></p>
<p>""Hell
Mary's first single ""Damned"" is an equally appropriate
soundtrack for when you find yourself writhing with your face in the
dirt, or when the devil gives you enough strength to pick yourself
up, dust off and embrace your human side again."" - Northwest

<p>Ilana
is quite different from, yet reminiscent of, the very early Joni
Mitchell - there is a similar element of lyrical magic and sense of
promise. Her songwriting embodies both simplicity and depth. She is
also frequently compared to Taylor Swift. With a sweetly innocent yet
heartrendingly wise and expressive voice, accompanied by her acoustic
guitar and piano, she produces a warm, familiar and poignant sound.
She began playing guitar when she was eight, and at age 23 has
already realized her dream of playing music full time while being
completely independent. “Emotions inspire me,” says Ilana. “My
lyrics don't describe emotions in a dictionary-like manner, rather
they describe an individual, a moment, or a memory that causes the
listener to feel that emotion and not just hear about it.” She
seems to know my main character better than I do myself, and is
contributing two tracks, one a key song written from the innermost
being of that character.</p>
<p>“For
any fans of poetry, delicately woven into soft, acoustic strings,
this adept young lady might have a warm song you could serve with a
cup of tea.” ~ undergroundminds.com</p>

<p>Keu
Ndebele is a South African musician, composer, singer and songwriter
whose musical style embraces songs rooted in African indigenous music
and indie rock, using guitar, piano, horns, xylophone and whatever
weird or exciting new instruments he can find. His debut album Cry
the Beloved Country, with a lead single that reached the top 10 on
local radio charts, is available on iTunes. He has been writing and
performing since age 14 and has toured in South Africa with his band
Keu II. For the last few years he has been producing session work for
various local and international music groups, and is currently
working on fresh material for his next release and actively recording
and playing live radio shows. I'd been wanting a warm yet dark
African touch to the soundtrack, but it took me awhile to find an
artist with the right sound. Keu has written a brilliant, mostly
instrumental song.</p>

<p>“LANA
DEL REY meets METALLICA!” This progressive art music duo,
originally from Adelaide, Australia has been likened to Kate Bush,
Pink Floyd, Stevie Nicks, Devin Townsend – and in their more eerie
moments, Cradle of Filth. The songs have an atmospheric, theatrical
quality, often building to a crescendo of primal vocals, ethereal
harmonies, strings &amp; choirs.</p>
<p>“If
there’s one thing you can pin them down to, it’s that you can’t
pin them down to any one style. Ethereal acoustic pop, speed metal,
haunting vocals, beauty and power, often all in the one song and
invariably accompanied by intelligent lyrics. They are equally adept
at the varying moods and styles, as proven by the consistent quality
of the vocals and instrumental performances. 5 stars."" - Michael

David
hails from Stuttgart. Born and raised in Germany, he is self-taught
on piano, guitar, percussion, flute, and in composition. He grew up
with electronic and house music which later led him to working as a
DJ. But he soon fell in love with classical / orchestral music, and,
inspired by John Williams' scores for Prisoner of Azkaban and Star
Wars II, started doing film scoring. His style is theme-oriented,
melodic, and classical; his favorite genres to score are fairytales
and children's movies. His current project is for a computer animated
apocalyptic movie, which will release late this year. Being a
perfectionist, he only scores 1-2 films a year.... but he kindly and
enthusiastically agreed to write a delicate piano-based love theme
for the novel's soundtrack.  :)<br/><br/><br/>

Saint
John was born in Canada, busked around Europe, and now makes Seattle
his home base, performing almost nightly throughout the Pacific
Northwest solo or with his band. He has opened for performers such as
Jackson Browne, Colin Hay (Men At Work), Tom Morello (RATM, The
Nightwatchman), Wang Chung, Naked Eyes, VAST, and many others.
Recently he's started recording some of his songs with Peter Buck
(R.E.M.), Bill Rieflin (R.E.M., KMFDM, Ministry, King Crimson), and
Scott McCaughey (R.E.M., Fresh Young Fellows, Minus 5), with
production by Paul Fox (10,000 Maniacs, Wallflowers, Semisonic,
Bjork). He has a real knack for capturing atmosphere through vivid
snapshot moments, with an aching sweetness. His songs have found
their way around the world and deeply into people’s lives and
hearts. The one that will be on the soundtrack certainly found its
way into mine, and while some of the lyrics are not closely aligned
with the story, it somehow just had to be on there. (It also turned
out to have Peter Buck of R.E.M. on backup guitar.) If you think of
the story as a movie, this song will be the one that makes you wipe a
tear over the closing credits.<br/><br/><br/><b>*****</b><br/><p>

This
obscure Seattle rock band has just found their destiny in the form of
acoustic rock, and I think will soon be obscure no more. I was lucky
enough to be at their very first acoustic performance, which
goosebumped me to my core. They made me think of several other bands
– Live, Kings of Leon, Godsmack – though they don't really sound
like any of them; their sound is familiar but all their own. I boldly
walked up to frontman Brent Quick after the show and said, “Would
you like to be on my novel's soundtrack?” Amazingly, he said
“Sure!” They've ended up with two songs on board.<br/><br/><br/>

Emmy &amp; Academy Awards). He's a bit of a musical virtuoso, playing
harmonica, bass, synthesizer / keyboard, mandolin, and percussion as
well as guitar. He'll be accenting the soundtrack with a crucial
touch of wild and untamed tribal!<br/><br/><br/>

Tobias
the Owl is a band based on the songwriting, guitar and vocals of
Toronto native Elijah Dhawan, now residing in Seattle. He spent years
traveling, sometimes on foot, throughout the southwest and along the
west coast. His music reflects the traditions of his Moroccan
heritage, from the deeply spiritual of Sufi music to the community
folk music of Berber culture: using music to heal and transcend to a
higher spiritual awareness. His songs have been covered by artists
such as Deer Tick and Jonah Tolchin, and he has worked with
drummer/percussionist Scott Seiver and legendary producer Marvin
Etzioni. He has been named “Best Songwriter” in the 2014 Seattle
Sound Music Awards, and also “Best Singer/Songwriter” in the 2014
Toronto Independent Music Awards. The band was recently signed with
London Tone Music. They'll be closing the story just before the
“credits” with a dark and deeply haunting song.<br/><br/><br/>

I
first connected with Pierre about two and a half years ago while
booking an international music tour. He makes his home in Hong Kong,
but started his musical career in Montreal as a jazz performance
major. He co-founded a world beats music group that won the Rythmes
Du Monde contest in Montreal; the group toured extensively through
Europe, and received a Juno nomination – the Canadian equivalent of
a Grammy Nomination. He has worked with choirs, singers, theatres,
dance companies and instrumentalists, exploring fresh approaches to
arranging and expanding his mastery of music software. In Hong Kong,
he has founded a jazz network, and is helping to build the next
generation of performance artists, regularly taking time out to teach
young, local musicians. Now he brings his smokey mysterious jazz
trance to the Edge soundtrack, with a touch of Oriental and an almost
Arabic overtone that oddly enhances the dark northern atmosphere.<br/>

Thanks to all
of my amazing soundtrack artists, who are listed in detail below!
Note: we'll be ADDING MORE GREAT REWARDS AS THE CAMPAIGN GOES ON! 
(Yeah, we're saving some of the goodies for later...)


~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 


I want to be clear that this Indiegogo is strictly for producing the soundtrack, not the actual novel.  But folks have been asking for more info on the story. You can find that at edgethenovel.blogspot.com.
You can also check out the trailer... because any novel with a soundtrack really should have a trailer.... ;)


Last week's


SOUNDTRACK TEASER: the great psych-folk sound of Tiny Messengers featuring the just-wow voice of Kimo Muraki! Kimo's many music credits include singing backing vocals on the debut 
album ""Dream Your Life Away"" from Vance Joy (Riptide, Mess Is Mine) on 
Atlantic Records, and he composed, arranged, and performed the horns for
 that entire album, including the sax, trumpet, coronet, 
baritone, mellophone, trombone, and flute!


Previous soundtrack teaser:
**The video is NOT related to the novel or soundtrack!! It's just the only direct link available to the song!


Previous soundtrack teaser:










Hi
there!
I'd
like to invite you to help make history by supporting the start of
what will hopefully become a new paradigm: soundtracks for novels!
This one is for my upcoming young adult sci-fi / fantasy novel, Edge - a dark-ish love story involving liminal beings who walk the edges between dimensions, and that also takes a rather unusual perspective on climate change.




This soundtrack is not music in an eBook.


It's
not meant to be listened to while you're reading the book.


It's
a closely connected but separate music project.


It's
basically like the soundtrack (NOT score) for a film.



It's
an album of amazing music that aligns with and enhances the
atmosphere of the book, but also stands just fine on its own.





It's said that stories are how we understand our world, and that right now we're in need of some new stories.
Edge is a story of a radically transforming world - including a more compassionate post-meat world - and is my gift to that world. This soundtrack is a crucial part of that gift. 

It will help reach people's hearts - where change begins.

Learn
more at http://edgethenovel.blogspot.com/



Sharing
great music has always been a passion of mine. I can’t
tell you how excited I am to introduce you to my soundtrack artists
(below) and share their phenomenal music with all of you. I'm honored and humbled that they want to be
a part of it.


I'm
just the vehicle for this project, which has taken on a life of its
own.
But
I'm honored to be the facilitator and coordinator.


Let’s
make a soundtrack together!


-CJK





WHY
SOUNDTRACK A NOVEL?


The
idea is that the music will help you feel for the story and the story
will help you feel the music.
The
two will cross-promote one another.
It's
a rough market these days for indie writers and musicians - which
is exactly why soundtracking novels could become an important new
paradigm.



The music helps with writing (I've actually written some scenes for
songs!)
The music helps to emotionally bond readers with the story, and vice
versa
The soundtrack expands the venue options for concerts, book tours, and especially
combination performances, and provides an unusual “hook” to help
music artists get shows - and authors get talks.

It
expands promo reach – reaching the audience of every project artist
instead of just one person.
This crowdfunding campaign provides additional publicity for all
The project connects artists and creates a community of mutual
support
It's FUN!



For
the author, for the music artists, and for you our audience – it's
a WIN – WIN – WIN!





THE
TEAM


My soundtrack
artists will have a basic contract and will retain the rights to
their songs.
Each
soundtrack artist will receive some CDs to give away or sell, as they
wish.
They
will have the option of purchasing future CDs at cost, to sell and
keep the money.
If
the soundtrack and novel do well, I hope to set up some future
combination music / book tours with soundtrack artists who are
interested.





THE
$ GOAL $


This
might look like a lot of money, but a lot of it goes away before it
even gets to us, via Indiegogo commissions and taxes.


If
we hit the goal we get a LOT better deal on Indiegogo commission
(paying only 4% as opposed to 9%).  This
means much more of your pledge goes to supporting the project instead
of paying fees.
So
here's hoping you can help us hit the goal!


I
don't believe in asking music artists to work for free and hopefully
you don't either. These artists have poured their hearts and souls
and piggy banks into their music. Many have written or adjusted songs
especially for this soundtrack. This Indiegogo is in part to
compensate them a little for their time and talent. Since there are
17 of them, it adds up.


But,
17 artists translates to nearly 75 minutes of wonderfully diverse yet unified
music for your ears and soul and imagination. That's a lot of bang for the buck!


The
money is also needed to cover the costs of mastering and
manufacturing the CD, rewards, and shipping. I also hope to make at
least one music video for a soundtrack song, since this would be
invaluable for promoting the soundtrack and the artists on it.


If
you would like to see the actual nitty gritty project budget, just
drop me an email at edgethenovel@gmail.com
and I'll be happy to provide it.



FAQs


If
we don't hit the goal will we still make the soundtrack?
Yes
– even if only as a digital.
But
then I might have to ask the artists to work for free :(
And
it could get kinda demoralizing, depending. Let's not go there!


If
we only raise enough money to release the soundtrack in digital form,
will folks who pledged for a real CD still get it?
Yes.
The cost of making those, and all the rewards, is built into the
pledges even if worst came to worst. And, actually, they would be
even more valuable at that point because there would be far fewer of
them!


If
we exceed the goal, what will we do with the extra money?
The
plan is to use that money to make music videos for more of the songs,
which will boost promotion of the project, provide additional
exposure for artists, and give you the audience some extra sweetness.
Additionally, I'll be using those videos to help deliver some of the
critical messages of the novel (climate change, environment, homelessness, etc.) at a deep emotional level... using
them as a vehicle for positive transformation in the world.







THE
REWARDS!


We've
put together some kickass rewards, some of them one of a kind that
will only and ever be available HERE and NOW.
AND
WE'LL BE ADDING MORE AS THE CAMPAIGN CONTINUES.


Just
think: these soundtrack artists are achieving new levels even as you read. Some
may break out before this soundtrack even releases. These
rewards could end up being hot items in the near future!


The
soundtrack CD itself is going to be a special, super sweet Indiegogo
version. We'll be doing a limited run with exclusive artwork. Any
future manufacturing runs will have different artwork. (More on this coming in the days ahead!)


If you
want to collect more than one reward (and of course you do), that's
great too!
And if you wish to support this project in other ways beyond or aside from this Indiegogo, we're open to considering that - drop us an email.


If
you have any questions on rewards, feel free to email us at
edgethenovel@gmail.com.
NEWLY ADDED: contribute just ONE DOLLAR to our project and we'll immediately email you a sheet (in both PDF and JPEG format) of 8 bookmarks, with the classy Edge photo and 8 different Edgy quotes and taglines. Yes you must print and cut them yourself, but that means you can print as many as you want! Pass them out to all your friends!






Contribute just $5 and get the above bookmarks PLUS a sheet of Edge SONGQUOTES bookmarks! Poetic words from the soundtrack. You could even punch a hole in the top and add one of those classy little tassled cords...

AND
NOW...
MEET
THE ARTISTS!


This
is an assembly of truly impressive talent! 



Two of these artists were
recently signed; 


one got a Juno (Canadian equivalent of Grammy)
nomination; 


one was named “Best Songwriter” in the 2014 Seattle
Sound Music Awards and “Best Singer/Songwriter” in the 2014
Toronto Independent Music Awards;

A
Berlin singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist who has been
involved in various music projects and is currently working solo.
She's inspired by nature and is “drawn to the darker issues of
life, exploring edges, filling the gap of the unknown.” The dark
intricate mystery of her music slinks into the soul. Her underworld
siren voice and overall haunting sound will be so welcome on the Edge
soundtrack that I'm going to try and squeeze in a second song from
her if space allows!

A
quite unique Berlin/London based indie-electronic producer/songwriter
and multi-instrumentalist, who has played around the UK including
Glastonbury Festival, the TT motorbike festival and numerous concerts
for Rock Against Racism. She's also played Florida and New York,
including a show at the famous Trash Bar and for ZombieCon. Keen to
delve into electronic music, she moved to Berlin to soak up the vibes
and to work on new material. Using a combination of Ableton Live,
guitar and micro Korg, she has successfully blended her passion for
electronic music with the raw sound of her roots, creating something
unique which many find hard to pinpoint.
In
2014, she recorded and produced her debut solo album in London. She
says, ""I was inspired by Rainer
Maria Rilke's,
'Letters to a young poet' and wanted to write an honest album
reflecting the events of that period.” She is currently in Berlin,
pursuing her interest in instrumental music and working on movie and
video game scoring and a new instrumental album, and was just signed
to a label.

HELL
MARY and PATRICK GALACTIC

Seattle,
U.S.

http://www.hellmarymusic.com/
https://www.facebook.com/hellmarymusic


http://www.patrickgalactic.com/






Hell
Mary is the alter ego of Seattle Indie Folk artist, Rachel Mary Helen
Angerman. “Hell Mary embodies the duality of my nature. It’s a
way to symbolize the darkness and light that lives within us all.”
When I think of her I think of ravens; I suspect that may be her
totem spirit. She's just finished her debut EP “Worship Games” and will be touring the west coast this summer.
On the Edge
soundtrack, she will be performing a duet, paired with the smokey
baritone of twinflame Patrick Galactic - solo acoustic artist and
frontman for the electro-punk trio Death By Stars.  Bathed in reverb and echo, Galactic’s work 
blends the weary introspection of Leonard Cohen, Nick Cave, and the 
Velvet Underground with the pop sensibilities of David Bowie, Elliot 
Smith and Harry Nilsson.
""Hell
Mary's first single ""Damned"" is an equally appropriate
soundtrack for when you find yourself writhing with your face in the
dirt, or when the devil gives you enough strength to pick yourself
up, dust off and embrace your human side again."" - Northwest

ILANA
HERST

New
York City, U.S.

http://undergroundminds.com/2015/01/20/featured-ilana-herst/

https://soundcloud.com/lana-herst




Ilana
is quite different from, yet reminiscent of, the very early Joni
Mitchell - there is a similar element of lyrical magic and sense of
promise. Her songwriting embodies both simplicity and depth. She is
also frequently compared to Taylor Swift. With a sweetly innocent yet
heartrendingly wise and expressive voice, accompanied by her acoustic
guitar and piano, she produces a warm, familiar and poignant sound.
She began playing guitar when she was eight, and at age 23 has
already realized her dream of playing music full time while being
completely independent. “Emotions inspire me,” says Ilana. “My
lyrics don't describe emotions in a dictionary-like manner, rather
they describe an individual, a moment, or a memory that causes the
listener to feel that emotion and not just hear about it.” She
seems to know my main character better than I do myself, and is
contributing two tracks, one a key song written from the innermost
being of that character.
“For
any fans of poetry, delicately woven into soft, acoustic strings,
this adept young lady might have a warm song you could serve with a
cup of tea.” ~ undergroundminds.com

https://www.facebook.com/KeuII?fref=ts



Keu
Ndebele is a South African musician, composer, singer and songwriter
whose musical style embraces songs rooted in African indigenous music
and indie rock, using guitar, piano, horns, xylophone and whatever
weird or exciting new instruments he can find. His debut album Cry
the Beloved Country, with a lead single that reached the top 10 on
local radio charts, is available on iTunes. He has been writing and
performing since age 14 and has toured in South Africa with his band
Keu II. For the last few years he has been producing session work for
various local and international music groups, and is currently
working on fresh material for his next release and actively recording
and playing live radio shows. I'd been wanting a warm yet dark
African touch to the soundtrack, but it took me awhile to find an
artist with the right sound. Keu has written a brilliant, mostly
instrumental song.

https://www.facebook.com/orsinonation?fref=ts




“LANA
DEL REY meets METALLICA!” This progressive art music duo,
originally from Adelaide, Australia has been likened to Kate Bush,
Pink Floyd, Stevie Nicks, Devin Townsend – and in their more eerie
moments, Cradle of Filth. The songs have an atmospheric, theatrical
quality, often building to a crescendo of primal vocals, ethereal
harmonies, strings & choirs.
“If
there’s one thing you can pin them down to, it’s that you can’t
pin them down to any one style. Ethereal acoustic pop, speed metal,
haunting vocals, beauty and power, often all in the one song and
invariably accompanied by intelligent lyrics. They are equally adept
at the varying moods and styles, as proven by the consistent quality
of the vocals and instrumental performances. 5 stars."" - Michael

Stuttgart,

David
hails from Stuttgart. Born and raised in Germany, he is self-taught
on piano, guitar, percussion, flute, and in composition. He grew up
with electronic and house music which later led him to working as a
DJ. But he soon fell in love with classical / orchestral music, and,
inspired by John Williams' scores for Prisoner of Azkaban and Star
Wars II, started doing film scoring. His style is theme-oriented,
melodic, and classical; his favorite genres to score are fairytales
and children's movies. His current project is for a computer animated
apocalyptic movie, which will release late this year. Being a
perfectionist, he only scores 1-2 films a year.... but he kindly and
enthusiastically agreed to write a delicate piano-based love theme
for the novel's soundtrack.  :)

SAINT
JOHN AND THE REVELATIONS

Seattle,
U.S.

http://www.sjatr.com/
https://www.facebook.com/saintjohnandtherevelations?fref=ts



Saint
John was born in Canada, busked around Europe, and now makes Seattle
his home base, performing almost nightly throughout the Pacific
Northwest solo or with his band. He has opened for performers such as
Jackson Browne, Colin Hay (Men At Work), Tom Morello (RATM, The
Nightwatchman), Wang Chung, Naked Eyes, VAST, and many others.
Recently he's started recording some of his songs with Peter Buck
(R.E.M.), Bill Rieflin (R.E.M., KMFDM, Ministry, King Crimson), and
Scott McCaughey (R.E.M., Fresh Young Fellows, Minus 5), with
production by Paul Fox (10,000 Maniacs, Wallflowers, Semisonic,
Bjork). He has a real knack for capturing atmosphere through vivid
snapshot moments, with an aching sweetness. His songs have found
their way around the world and deeply into people’s lives and
hearts. The one that will be on the soundtrack certainly found its
way into mine, and while some of the lyrics are not closely aligned
with the story, it somehow just had to be on there. (It also turned
out to have Peter Buck of R.E.M. on backup guitar.) If you think of
the story as a movie, this song will be the one that makes you wipe a
tear over the closing credits.*****

Seattle,

http://www.reverbnation.com/shadesofstatic
https://www.facebook.com/pages/Shades-of-Static/471605746192327?fref=ts




This
obscure Seattle rock band has just found their destiny in the form of
acoustic rock, and I think will soon be obscure no more. I was lucky
enough to be at their very first acoustic performance, which
goosebumped me to my core. They made me think of several other bands
– Live, Kings of Leon, Godsmack – though they don't really sound
like any of them; their sound is familiar but all their own. I boldly
walked up to frontman Brent Quick after the show and said, “Would
you like to be on my novel's soundtrack?” Amazingly, he said
“Sure!” They've ended up with two songs on board.

A
Boston area Berklee graduate, Frank is currently working as a singer

Europe. He has also recorded television and radio commercial tracks.
He describes his approach to music composition as “mining for gems.
I believe musical ideas are around us all the time, waiting to be
discovered for anyone willing to make the effort.” One of his

Musical
sorcerer Wes Speight is listed as one of the “Seattle bands to
watch in 2015” by NadaMucho.com -
http://www.nadamucho.com/41-seattle-bands-were-...
  He
has been hailed as “gritty and gutty,” with “sometimes
otherworldly voice and music [that] ensnare the soul.” He has
played across the nation including Nashville, Manhattan, San Diego,
Portland and Seattle, and has released four full length albums (one 
brand new on July 1, the same day this Indiegogo launched!) and
several EPs. His songs have been heard on various stations around the
country including Lightning 100, WRVU, NWCZ radio, Seattle Wave Radio
and Radio Crystal Blue. He is signed with Washington Street
Publishing in Nashville, which represents some of Nashville's top
songwriters (including those with #1 Country songs, BMI, ASCAP, CMA,
Emmy & Academy Awards). He's a bit of a musical virtuoso, playing

https://www.facebook.com/tobiastheowl?fref=ts




Tobias
the Owl is a band based on the songwriting, guitar and vocals of
Toronto native Elijah Dhawan, now residing in Seattle. He spent years
traveling, sometimes on foot, throughout the southwest and along the
west coast. His music reflects the traditions of his Moroccan
heritage, from the deeply spiritual of Sufi music to the community
folk music of Berber culture: using music to heal and transcend to a
higher spiritual awareness. His songs have been covered by artists
such as Deer Tick and Jonah Tolchin, and he has worked with
drummer/percussionist Scott Seiver and legendary producer Marvin
Etzioni. He has been named “Best Songwriter” in the 2014 Seattle
Sound Music Awards, and also “Best Singer/Songwriter” in the 2014
Toronto Independent Music Awards. The band was recently signed with
London Tone Music. They'll be closing the story just before the
“credits” with a dark and deeply haunting song.

PIERRE
VENIOT

Hong
Kong

https://www.youtube.com/user/VeniotPierre




I
first connected with Pierre about two and a half years ago while
booking an international music tour. He makes his home in Hong Kong,
but started his musical career in Montreal as a jazz performance
major. He co-founded a world beats music group that won the Rythmes
Du Monde contest in Montreal; the group toured extensively through
Europe, and received a Juno nomination – the Canadian equivalent of
a Grammy Nomination. He has worked with choirs, singers, theatres,
dance companies and instrumentalists, exploring fresh approaches to
arranging and expanding his mastery of music software. In Hong Kong,
he has founded a jazz network, and is helping to build the next
generation of performance artists, regularly taking time out to teach
young, local musicians. Now he brings his smokey mysterious jazz
trance to the Edge soundtrack, with a touch of Oriental and an almost
Arabic overtone that oddly enhances the dark northern atmosphere.

D.C. once played host to a number of Jazz clubs, jam sessions and the like during the 20th century but in the last few decades those venues and musicians have become scarce. It is the CHJJ's mission to create a space where musicians of different levels can come together and play with hopes that the advanced musicians will bring up the beginner musicians. The Jam session is a communal activity that strengthens the Jazz scene and makes musicians want to play on a higher level, spend more time practicing and rehearsing and creates a friendly sense of competition.Since its inception the CHJJ has hosted a number of well known and legendary Jazz musicians in the house band and even revived an old Jazz tradition of musical competition with the infamous Cuttin' Contest. The Cuttin' Contest has become the highlight of the CHJJ. From March to May of 2015 musicians competed in three rounds of elimination for the top prize of $50 or a $25 gift card to the runner-up and the winners were chosen by the audience's applause. And in a effort to give back to the community, the CHJJ held a Back to School Drive to donate school supplies to the Two Rivers Public Charter School. We would like to do more to build bridges in our community. 

In our short time we have:Been picked by the Washington City Paper as the Best, Oldest Newest Jazz VenueParticipated in the D.C. Jazz Fest's Jazz in the Hood program as part of the DC Jazz Fest 2015Have been a part of the Fox 5 Zip Trip Special on the Capitol Hill/Eastern Market neighborhoodHeld a Back to School Drive for the Two Rivers Public Charter SchoolGiven out $300 in cash and $150 in gift cards to musicians in the Cuttin' ContestWe would love to increase our ability in the community but we need your support:We would like to pay our house band more than we do. These are legendary musicians with decades of experience and we want to make sure that they are justly compensated for their talent and time.We want to offer a higher prize for our Cuttin' Contest and Finale Contest. We believe that a competitive Jazz scene is a healthy Jazz scene. We want to form more partnerships with local schools and arts programs as part of our effort of giving back. We need to be able to sponsor deserving students with materials they need to be successful studentsWe want to have special guest musicians, local and out of state and compensate them.If you would like to see more please visit Mr. Henry's website, the Capitol Hill Jazz Jam Facebook Page our Youtube channel. We are also on Twitter @CapHillJazzJam and Instagram @CapitolHillJazzJamWe greatly appreciate any and all of your support and invite you to come check us out live every Wednesday 8-11pm at Mr. Henry's Restaurant 601 Pennsylvania Ave. S.E.",5.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>The statement above has been my defining purpose for as long as I can remember. I wasn't born into a musical family, but one day when I was about 15, something in me allowed me to believe I have the ability to do music, so I pursued it and have been doing it ever since.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Around mid-2012, I did my first official studio recording--a single entitled “Who Are We”, an original song that’s dear to my heart. Well, 2012 was a long time ago, and aside from some travelling, I've been writing and performing many more songs since then and I want you to hear them. It’s time to hit the studio again, and this time, I'm recording a 4-song EP called “#LoveLifeAndGod”

<h2><b>What is my music about?</b></h2>
<p>I was born and raised in Jamaica, where I spent the first half of my life. I later migrated to the U.S. where I spent the next half, and then a year ago, I moved to Africa--a long way from my small island. This has put me in the interesting position of having lived in both the 1st and 3rd world, and from this viewpoint, I've observed that quite a number of people either think the grass is always greener or browner on the other side. My conclusion is this: it’s just grass, and grass changes color. Regardless of our religion, race, or grass, our humanity binds us together. A man is my brother because he is human, therefore, he is entitled to my love regardless. As a songwriter, I desire to simply write about the world through the lens of my faith, experience, and understanding. I see the many problems that exist, and I see how easily men lose hope. If my songs can inspire and encourage, I have accomplished my goal.</p>

<div>These songs were carefully selected from my vault because I feel that, with everything that's going on today, I want to use my music as a way to help uplift the human spirit. My hope is to embolden my audience as they navigate the confusions and tumults along the way.<br/><br/><p></p>

<strong>The Recording Process</strong>
</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Currently, I’m living in Uganda where I serve with an empowerment organization, and will not be able to travel back to the U.S. to record this EP (although that would be nice). However, with today's technology, a cross-continental production is as easy as pushing a button. I’ll do the pre-production work in Uganda, then send it to my producer in Philly where we will collaborate remotely on producing the tracks. After we produce the tracks, we will fly them back to Africa via the internet where I will record vocals. After vocals are done, we will send it back to America again for mixing and mastering, and after that, I will make it available online so the whole world can have access. Cool huh?</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2><b>Why I need you</b></h2>
<p>Good production is really expensive! It takes a lot of hours put in by musicians, recording engineers, producers, and other music professionals. For me to bring this project to completion, I need a team of backers and supporters like you.</p>
<p>To complete this project, we need to raise $5,000.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>Here's a quick breakdown:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>$150 for pre-production costs</li>
<li>$1,000 for recording</li>
<li>$500 for mixing</li>
<li>$400 for mastering</li>
<li>$1,500 for CD printing</li>
<li>$300 for artwork</li>
<li>$600 for merchandise (t-shirts, posters, etc.)</li>
<li>Plus digital distribution, promotion, crowdfunding fees, and other expenses!</li>
</ul>
<div>
<b>Everyone can help</b><p></p>
<p>Let’s say you don’t have any money to back to the campaign. I still need you on my team.

The statement above has been my defining purpose for as long as I can remember. I wasn't born into a musical family, but one day when I was about 15, something in me allowed me to believe I have the ability to do music, so I pursued it and have been doing it ever since.

Around mid-2012, I did my first official studio recording--a single entitled “Who Are We”, an original song that’s dear to my heart. Well, 2012 was a long time ago, and aside from some travelling, I've been writing and performing many more songs since then and I want you to hear them. It’s time to hit the studio again, and this time, I'm recording a 4-song EP called “#LoveLifeAndGod”
Click here to listen, get lyrics, and download the single for free


What is my music about?
I was born and raised in Jamaica, where I spent the first half of my life. I later migrated to the U.S. where I spent the next half, and then a year ago, I moved to Africa--a long way from my small island. This has put me in the interesting position of having lived in both the 1st and 3rd world, and from this viewpoint, I've observed that quite a number of people either think the grass is always greener or browner on the other side. My conclusion is this: it’s just grass, and grass changes color. Regardless of our religion, race, or grass, our humanity binds us together. A man is my brother because he is human, therefore, he is entitled to my love regardless. As a songwriter, I desire to simply write about the world through the lens of my faith, experience, and understanding. I see the many problems that exist, and I see how easily men lose hope. If my songs can inspire and encourage, I have accomplished my goal.



The EP


This is an Indiegogo exclusive campaign— meaning that the perks here will not be available anywhere else at any time after this campaign has ended.
This EP will consist of 4 songs, plus a bonus track (available depending on your backing amount). These songs are meant to give everyone a taste of my message, and it'll also allow the opportunity to take my musical journey to another level.
The tracks to be included are:


Peace Must Come to Earth
Everything is Alright (Once there is Love)

Reason to Sing
Lift my Hands (God of my Life)
Bonus track (can’t tell you the name--it’s a surprise)

These songs were carefully selected from my vault because I feel that, with everything that's going on today, I want to use my music as a way to help uplift the human spirit. My hope is to embolden my audience as they navigate the confusions and tumults along the way.




The Recording Process


Currently, I’m living in Uganda where I serve with an empowerment organization, and will not be able to travel back to the U.S. to record this EP (although that would be nice). However, with today's technology, a cross-continental production is as easy as pushing a button.

After vocals are done, we will send it back to America again for mixing and mastering, and after that, I will make it available online so the whole world can have access. Cool huh?

Why I need you
Good production is really expensive! It takes a lot of hours put in by musicians, recording engineers, producers, and other music professionals. For me to bring this project to completion, I need a team of backers and supporters like you.
To complete this project, we need to raise $5,000.


Here's a quick breakdown:

$150 for pre-production costs
$1,000 for recording
$500 for mixing
$400 for mastering
$1,500 for CD printing
$300 for artwork
$600 for merchandise (t-shirts, posters, etc.)
Plus digital distribution, promotion, crowdfunding fees, and other expenses!

<h3>Overview of Guitar-Jo</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Though guitars and banjos are both stringed instruments, they are very different. Guitar players who desire to play the banjo often do not follow through for several reasons: A banjo uses metal finger picks to pluck the strings versus a guitar pick or bare fingers, they have a very different tuning and playing style, it requires time to learn a completely new instrument and it is an extra expense. That is where Guitar-Jo comes in.</p>
<p>Guitar-Jo is an electric guitar accessory that mounts onto the body of a guitar and produces the sound of a banjo. It is more affordable, easy to use, and gives guitarists the opportunity to broaden the sound of their guitar. Watch the video at the top of the page to see how it works!</p>

<p>I am Nubia Emmon, an R&amp;B artist from Austin, Texas. I've been singing since the age of 3 and performing since I was 7 years old. My goal is to become a world-class performer while making a meaningful contribution through my Foundation, especially by raising awareness about breast cancer, research and detection.<br/></p>
<p>What I hope to accomplish through Indiegogo and with YOUR help is twofold: convene our 2nd annual ""Pretty Girls that Rock the Mic for Breast Cancer Awareness"" Benefit concert and complete my EP. In addition to the many perks listed, ALL contributors will have their names listed in the Acknowledgements as having made this all possible.<br/></p>
<p>This campaign is soooo important to me because I absolutely love music and I made a promise to myself AND to my Mother that I would make it in the music industry. Unfortunately, my Mother passed away about a year ago from breast cancer, I cannot begin to describe to you how much I miss her and would give anything to have her back! With that said, I made a promise to her that I would succeed as a Musician and I want to keep that promise.</p>
<p>Prior to her passing, with my Team, I had been involved in raising awareness about this deadly disease and the importance of early detection.  About a couple of years ago, we organized our first ""Pretty Girls that Rock the Mic for Breast Cancer Awareness"" concert. The purpose was to showcase some of Austin's brightest women artists from a variety of music genres while raising breast cancer awareness in a benefit concert. We worked with the Susan G. Komen Foundation/Austin Affiliate in educating the public and my Mom gave a personal testimony. With only 3 weeks of planning and on a shoestring budget, we drew over 600 people and it was held at a local club. <br/></p>

<br/><p>This project is important to me because with your help, my Team and I want to Rock our next Pretty Girls concert at a larger-family friendly venue so we can reach more people (5000 is our target)--especially young people who may think ""it can't happen to me"" (My Mom was only 44). My vision is for this to become an annual educational/musical event.</p>
<p>Some of the exciting things I've been part of with help from my Team:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pretty Girls that Rock the Mic benefit concert (2012)<br/>
</li>
<li>Breast Cancer Awareness Mixer (2012)<br/>
</li>
<li>Invited to sing the National Anthem at the Susan G. Komen/Austin Race for the Cure (11/2012); also participated in other Komen/Austin events<br/>

<h3>The Impact</h3>By joining this Movement, your support will not only help us to convene the next Pretty Girls that Rock the Mic concert, but you will be helping to educate our youth and families whom we hope to inspire to join the breast cancer awareness movement. In addition, you will be helping me to release my very first EP as an Indie Artist. I describe my music as fun, fresh, and ""relatable"" to the things teenagers and people in general go through. I am extremely excited about that!!!<br/><p></p> <ul></ul> <p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>My goal is to raise $20,000. Here is the breakdown of where funds will go:</p>

<b>Production</b> ($7000); We've raised funds for the music that I am currently working on but we're still short and so funds are needed for new music in order to complete the EP. This also involves Mixing &amp; Mastering, Studio recording, CDs (pressing and packaging) and music videos. This budget also includes Sound and Lighting for the Pretty Girls concert.<br/><br/><p><b>Marketing </b>($7000); Advertising (Online, TV &amp; Radio spots), Online Wire services, Website design &amp; maintenance, Videography (event documentation), Photography, Promotional giveaways,</p>
<p><b>Professional Fees and Living/Misc. fees</b> ($4000)</p>
<ul>
<li>Publicist and Event Planner ($1800)</li>
<li>Indiegogo fees + S/H of our perks to you = 15%</li>
<li>My music is my first job. My second job helps me pay the bills. I've had
 to scale down on my work hours in order to give the time necessary for 
this project. (.08% of the total budget will go to living expenses)   
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Travel </b>($2000); Even while we are organizing this
event, shows are still being booked in and out of town and so funds are needed to
help me get from city to city as well as out of state. </p>
<p><b>If I surpass my goal of $20,000, funds will be used to:</b><br/></p>
<ul>
<li>Begin planning for the 2016 Pretty Girls that Rock the Mic Concert<br/>
</li>
<li>Begin work on next EP<br/>
</li>
<li>Use surplus funds to organize fundraisers<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>If we don't reach our entire goal on  Indiegogo:</b><br/></p>
<p>We will continue to raise money through sponsorships, angel investors, local fundraisers, in-kind contributions and personal efforts.<br/></p> Please be sure to check out our wonderful GIFTS for you!<br/><ul> </ul> </div> <div><br/></div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> Musicians face the challenge of being in a very risky industry where you have to create your own opportunities to make it to the top. Knowing that there are other talented artist who want the same thing as I do, I understand that I have to work hard to distinguish myself.<br/></p>
<p>One of my greatest assets is my very knowledgeable team and primarily my manager who has over 20 years experience in the music industry. Having started with nothing but the power of belief, help from family and friends, we've come this far so I believe that when you start from the bottom, you're unstoppable<br/></p>

Use surplus funds to organize fundraisers


If we don't reach our entire goal on  Indiegogo:
We will continue to raise money through sponsorships, angel investors, local fundraisers, in-kind contributions and personal efforts. Please be sure to check out our wonderful GIFTS for you!     Risks & Challenges  Musicians face the challenge of being in a very risky industry where you have to create your own opportunities to make it to the top. Knowing that there are other talented artist who want the same thing as I do, I understand that I have to work hard to distinguish myself.
One of my greatest assets is my very knowledgeable team and primarily my manager who has over 20 years experience in the music industry. Having started with nothing but the power of belief, help from family and friends, we've come this far so I believe that when you start from the bottom, you're unstoppable

Hello, I'm Joy Stuhr,  a

In September
2014, I was invited to go to Ghana with the German/Ghanaian artist Philip Metz  to and participate in his project, Eagle Africa.  (Click for more info!)


(Philip Metz, on left, being introduced at his exhibition in Accra, Ghana at the Goethe Institute)
My role
was to create music that represented both Germany and Ghana, by
working and composing with local artists in Ghana and combining their
traditional music and instruments with Western classical elements. 

(In the practice room with Dela!)The result
was one of the best musical experiences of my life. I had the honor to meet and play
with Dela Botri, who is well-established in Ghana with his traditional Ghanaian band, and
together we combined our original music to create something beautiful and new.
We were able to record one song, and afterwards, we wanted to repeat the
experience. (Curious? Look to the right: You can purchase the song in the PERKS!)

(Day of the exhibition!)The reaction from the audience the day of the exhibition was
enthusiastic and inspiring. The people sang along, while I played a Steinway
piano with Dela and his drummer!

Click HERE to listen to Dela Botri's music! 
The whole
trip inspired me to return to Ghana and record, not just one song, but a whole
CD. I don't want to stop with Ghana, though - I want to work in other countries, learn from them and
their traditional music as a way to honor it, value it and expose it to others. This is just the start!
Dela Botri mentioned that he teaches flute to youth at “Street Academy”.  A school  that provides free education to children in Accra, Ghana.

 While I am working on the CD
project, I also plan to give one week of intensive lessons and workshops to students that could benefit from the experience, and otherwise could not afford it!  


Through all
my past experiences in Panama, South America and New York, with music and
education, my heart has a calling to this project. I cant wait to get started, and
I want to thank you in advance for your support!

  What We Need & What You Get Where your donation will go:  Fund the cost of recording in Ghana: 150€ per track for the musicians, 100€ per track for the recording and mastering. That's 250€ per track. We would like to do at least 6 tracks for 1,500€.  Support a track and the original song will be dedicated to you! Fund the teaching expenses. I want to pay a donation to Dela Botri so he can take time off to join me in teaching the students. 
 
Instruments and costumes to donate to ""Street Academy's"" Drum team. 

Costs and travel expenses to go there, stay there, and get around: 1.000€ flight, 700€ Lodging, 350€ travel expenses for moving equipment, etc, 550€ food and other expenses. 2.600€ estimated total

Invite Philip Metz to come make a documentary about the creation he started. 1000€ minimum budget.

After the trip, I will have the CD production and design costs, which could be about another estimated 1.000€

In sum: we need minimum 5.000€ at least ($5,600) to make the project happen! If we don't make the full goal, we will still send a donation to ""Street Academy"" and post-pone the project until the summer.
We will keep raising funds while we are there, until we leave Ghana, and the ideal goal is to reach $9.000 so we can afford everything listed above! Anything above that will be donated to the academy and used to make more tracks!

""perks"" your interest--from a CD, to a copy of the finished documentary, to having
 a song written in dedication to you, or a shout-out from the artists on Youtube!   The Impact Your donation will make a difference with this project in many ways:  Create the possibility for new music with traditional Ghanaian instruments to exist in the world that otherwise wouldn't! 
 As a musician, I will get to learn and grow from the beautiful, traditional music of Ghana and bring it back to the USA and Europe. 

You will be making my dream come true to do this project!
 A select group of children with musical talent will have the opportunity to grow musically and learn more about their traditional music.  Many of these children would otherwise not be able to afford it.

<p>In 1989, two years before Magic Johnson announced he was HIV positive, My uncle and godfather lost his life to AIDS; he was a mere 28 years old. Although his life ended far too soon I am working on his legacy will lasting forever with this Indiegogo project to bring the recently found rare recording to life. I'm working with my uncle and godfather's music to raise awareness about HIV, encouraging everyone to know their own HIV status. This is important everywhere, but especially in Miami-Dade County, which <a href=""http://www.careresource.org/hivaids/statistics/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Care Sources </a>indicates is the number one county in Florida for new cases of HIV.</p>

The harmonious sounds of his my late uncle and godfather, Daniel Coulanges, filled the room as Daniel played an unaccompanied classical guitar adaptation of:</p>

I came to the US to study jazz at Berklee College Of  Music.<br/>I always liked to play music the same way I like to listen to music: from Bach to Charlie Parker, from the Beatles to Jobim, from Piazzolla to Burt Bacharach…<br/>Each style gives me the opportunity to “sing” melodies and enjoy the most beautiful game for me that is improvisation. <br/>Since moving to New York I have had the great privilege to record and perform with legendary artists <strong>Paquito D'Rivera, Eumir Deodato</strong>, <strong>Al Di Meola</strong>, <strong>Dave Samuels /The Caribbean Jazz Project</strong>, <strong>Dizzy Gillespie’s United Nations Orchestra</strong>, <strong>Bebo Valdes</strong>, all of whom helped me nurture my vision of music. <br/>I have released two albums, “El Angel” and “Oscar E Familia,” collaborating with  Grammy award-winning musicians Gato Barbieri, Paquito D‘Rivera, Alex Acuna, Claudio Roditti, Mark Turner and many others.<br/>Most recently I have recorded material for what is going to be my third album 'GOL' with some of the hottest musicians on the jazz scene today: drummer <strong>Antonio Sanchez</strong>, bassist <strong>John Benitez</strong>, pianist and keyboardist <strong>Leo Genovese</strong> and composer <strong>Guillermo Klein</strong>.<br/>And I am hoping to have you onboard to help me give birth to this CD!</p><p><br/><strong>About the CD 'GOL'</strong><br/>This is probably my most adventurous recording.<br/><strong>GOL</strong> represents emotion, interaction and teamwork. All elements necessary to score a goal, not only in soccer but also in life.<br/>Everyone on board was eager to embark on such a journey, where we were ready to leave our comfort zone, being free from interpretive and stylistical boundaries, “without the net” … Our rendering, our sound turned more poetic and dreamy and quite personal.<br/>The songs we chose to play are standards and originals, that even though are traditional in form, gave us the opportunity to stretch boundaries and surprise ourselves…<br/>From the traditional Cuban bolero from the 1930’s <strong>“Murmullo”</strong> to a modern modal composition of mine <strong>“Viva Belgrano de Cordoba”</strong> dedicated to my favorite soccer team. From an exquisite swing tune by Duke Pearson <strong>“Is That So”</strong> to a pop song by Beck <strong>“Nobody’s Fault But My Own“</strong>, of which we made a video during the recording session.</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/1lgjEWwxFXw?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><div><strong>“Nobody’s Fault But My Own“</strong></div><p> <br/> </p><p><strong>About the musicians</strong><br/>I would like to speak briefly about each of the musicians who played in the album, starting with four time Grammy Award-winner and Golden Globe nominee drummer <strong>Antonio Sanchez</strong>, who played and recorded with the likes of the Pat Metheny Group and Chick Corea. Antonio composed and played the groundbreaking original drum score for “Birdman”, the 2015 Oscar winner for Best Picture.<br/><strong>John Benitez</strong>, one of the hottest bass players on the jazz scene. who has played with great artists such as Eddie Palmieri and Chick Corea.<br/>A great pianist and emerging young keyboardist <strong>Leo Genovese</strong>, who has performed with Esperanza Spalding and Wayne Shorter.<br/>Another fellow country man who played on the album is <strong>Guillermo Klein</strong>, a great composer who contributed with two of his songs and vocals on “La Cancion Que Falta”.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479680598/nvzcghfxjlgoazopi1zx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>From left to right: Antonio Sanchez, John Benitez, recording engineer Luis Bacque, Leo Genovese, Oscar Feldman<br/> </p><p> </p><p><strong>Why I need You</strong><br/>For a musician, releasing a CD is somehow bringing to the world a little piece of eternity… I am reaching out to you in the hope of your support in doing so. <br/>There are so many expenses involved in producing an album of this scale. At this point I am halfway through the process. <br/>Only with your generous help will I be able to complete the project and make it come to life.<br/>So far I was able to cover the following expenses: <br/>Studio recording<br/>Musicians fees<br/>Transportation and lodging<br/>Video song production<br/>Mixing and mastering<br/> <br/>Your financial support will cover the following crucial expenses: <br/><strong>CD Manufacturing <br/>Art work<br/>Liner notes<br/>Distribution<br/>Promotional expenses</strong> <br/> <br/>As you can see there are many reward-categories to choose from.

I came to the US to study jazz at Berklee College Of  Music.I always liked to play music the same way I like to listen to music: from Bach to Charlie Parker, from the Beatles to Jobim, from Piazzolla to Burt Bacharach…Each style gives me the opportunity to “sing” melodies and enjoy the most beautiful game for me that is improvisation. Since moving to New York I have had the great privilege to record and perform with legendary artists Paquito D'Rivera, Eumir Deodato, Al Di Meola, Dave Samuels /The Caribbean Jazz Project, Dizzy Gillespie’s United Nations Orchestra, Bebo Valdes, all of whom helped me nurture my vision of music. I have released two albums, “El Angel” and “Oscar E Familia,” collaborating with  Grammy award-winning musicians Gato Barbieri, Paquito D‘Rivera, Alex Acuna, Claudio Roditti, Mark Turner and many others.Most recently I have recorded material for what is going to be my third album 'GOL' with some of the hottest musicians on the jazz scene today: drummer Antonio Sanchez, bassist John Benitez, pianist and keyboardist Leo Genovese and composer Guillermo Klein.And I am hoping to have you onboard to help me give birth to this CD!About the CD 'GOL'This is probably my most adventurous recording.GOL represents emotion, interaction and teamwork. All elements necessary to score a goal, not only in soccer but also in life.Everyone on board was eager to embark on such a journey, where we were ready to leave our comfort zone, being free from interpretive and stylistical boundaries, “without the net” … Our rendering, our sound turned more poetic and dreamy and quite personal.The songs we chose to play are standards and originals, that even though are traditional in form, gave us the opportunity to stretch boundaries and surprise ourselves…From the traditional Cuban bolero from the 1930’s “Murmullo” to a modern modal composition of mine “Viva Belgrano de Cordoba” dedicated to my favorite soccer team. From an exquisite swing tune by Duke Pearson “Is That So” to a pop song by Beck “Nobody’s Fault But My Own“, of which we made a video during the recording session.“Nobody’s Fault But My Own“  About the musiciansI would like to speak briefly about each of the musicians who played in the album, starting with four time Grammy Award-winner and Golden Globe nominee drummer Antonio Sanchez, who played and recorded with the likes of the Pat Metheny Group and Chick Corea. Antonio composed and played the groundbreaking original drum score for “Birdman”, the 2015 Oscar winner for Best Picture.John Benitez, one of the hottest bass players on the jazz scene. who has played with great artists such as Eddie Palmieri and Chick Corea.A great pianist and emerging young keyboardist Leo Genovese, who has performed with Esperanza Spalding and Wayne Shorter.Another fellow country man who played on the album is Guillermo Klein, a great composer who contributed with two of his songs and vocals on “La Cancion Que Falta”.From left to right: Antonio Sanchez, John Benitez, recording engineer Luis Bacque, Leo Genovese, Oscar Feldman  Why I need YouFor a musician, releasing a CD is somehow bringing to the world a little piece of eternity… I am reaching out to you in the hope of your support in doing so. There are so many expenses involved in producing an album of this scale. At this point I am halfway through the process. Only with your generous help will I be able to complete the project and make it come to life.So far I was able to cover the following expenses: Studio recordingMusicians feesTransportation and lodgingVideo song productionMixing and mastering Your financial support will cover the following crucial expenses: CD Manufacturing Art workLiner notesDistributionPromotional expenses  As you can see there are many reward-categories to choose from. But I want you to know that every contribution will get me closer to my goal.Thank you for your help and support!Let’s score this GOL together! Ahora en Español..Hola a todos!Mi nombre es Oscar Feldman.

<p>Let me present you my shopping list and from where the ""Wind of Change"" must pass. Due to non-professional equipment, there is distortion of sound and bad noise so we cannot satisfy our customers at full capacity.</p>
<p>First of all you must have the right gear for your tasks so that's why I will be needing  these:</p>
<p>1)  Console to establish a better connection between main speakers of the coffeehouse, the microphones, the headphones and the server that radio broadcasts. Till now this is my biggest problem.</p>
<p>2) Professional microphones and headphones so we can broadcast equally good inside the coffeehouse and on the internet. Also with the right equipment we could satisfactorily accommodate artists, bands and others for interviews and presentations.</p>
<p>3) Build the studio to be a real studio. As you will see at the video,  the place I named ""studio"" it's a part of the coffeehouse I made myself with materials I had or found since the moment I took the decision to make The Old School Project true. So to build the studio I will need the right materials such as wood, plasterboard etc.</p>
<p>4) Make it soundproof! No need to explain that I think .... I must isolate the sound coming from the coffeehouse to the studio, preventing echo and miking.</p>
<p><b>'nough said for the gear, although I had a few more to say!</b></p>
<p><b>Let's talk about the environment</b></p>
<p>The place where the studio is, has enough free space and I am willing to do what we call lounge. A comfortable place that my guests will wait for the time to present their work on air, enjoying the best coffee.</p>
<p>Let's see what I will need for the proper environment.</p>

<p>2)  Materials and hardware to build it.</p>
<p>3) The things everyone want in their living room. Sofa, chairs, lights etc.</p>
<p>4) Safety first. Secure the equipment. Therefore a part of your contributions will buy a few cameras and an alarm.</p>
<p>5) For all above I will need extra hands so as you can understand I will need workers fit for the job. Construction, paint, cleaning etc.</p>

<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<p><b><u>BRIEF REVIEW</u></b></p>
<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<p>My name is<b>Angel Irizarry</b>, and I am a
Dominican Musician. In early 2015, seeking to fulfill my
biggest dream, I applied to the prestigious <b>college of music,Berklee</b> and got average academic
scholarship.  Few months later, I
got some support from my country’s <b>Ministry of Education</b><span> and the <b>Latin Grammy Foundation</b>.
Thanks to them, I completed the academic scholarship.</span></p>
<p>However, they still
lack<b>US$20,000</b> since this
scholarship does not cover maintenance and must be enrolled for the <b>2016
Summer (by May)</b>because
the grant expires and I cannot let it pass. So, because of this crucial
reason, I decided to start a <b>Pro-Fundraising Campaign with
Indiegogo called “One Step for Angel!”</b> All the proceeds will be used
to cover the necessary expenses. Hopefully, we will achieve, at least, a year
for studying.</p>
<p>I've waited my
whole life for this unique opportunity, and with your help and support,
this will be possible and will become a reality. Your contribution (big or
small) will make a difference... and it will become a big step.</p>
<p></p>

<p><b><u>YOUR
GIFT OF APPRECIATION:</u></b></p>
<p>I would like to show you my appreciation by offering guitar
lessons! You can choose your class throught different ways (<i>Skype, Google Video</i>) You can send me a
message specifying what exactly would you like to achieve and I
will do my best to teach you!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b><u><br/></u></b></p>
<p><b><u>INVESTMENT OF COLLECTED FOUNDS</u></b></p>
<p>The estimated goal is <b>US $ 20,000.00</b>
of which US $ 1,000.00 Indiegogo will retain for the service
agreement page.</p>
<p>With the remaining funds, I can pay for my
first year of maintenance, as well as, travelling costs, local
transportation, buy computers and software that requires Berklee, books, health
insurance and other added expenses.</p>

<p>The music is a tie that binds people to people, from
my early days as a student and as a teacher, I could see how it transforms
people, and ultimately, I would like that my music transcends
borders. With your help you will be helping to spread this universal language
and transforming lives through music.</p>
<p>I am very grateful that Berklee has been fixed in my
work, who has valued my talent and my compositions, it is a big commitment that
I accept. I take great pride in my music and accept this great
opportunity to demonstrate my roots and show the great artistic
diversity of the Dominican culture.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I'm really anxious to see, with your help, the results of this career,
to continue creating, composing, playing my music to feel the adrenaline that
gives and the thrill of hearing the applause at each stage.</p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<p><b><u>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</u></b></p>
<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<p>After the first year, I shall be able to work and seek more
opportunities to continue paying such expenses over the next years of the career.
After all, at the end of this Indiegogo’s campaing first stage, they provide
the option to continue raising funds through its associated page called <b>InDemand</b>.</p>
<p>Even if we cannot collect the necessary funds, I, at least, hope

<p>Mi nombre es <b>Angel Irizarry</b>,
músico Dominicano.  En busca de cumplir
uno de mis sueños, a principios del 2015 aplique a la prestigiosa
universidad <b>Berklee College Of Music </b>y obtuve media beca
académica. Unos meses después logre el apoyo del <b>Ministerio de
Educación</b> de mi país y de la<b> Fundación Latin Grammy</b>.
Gracias a ellos pude completar la beca académica.</p>
<p>Sin embargo, <b>aún hacen faltan
U$20,000</b>, pues esta beca no me cubre manutención y debo inscribirme
en <b>verano del 2016 (mayo)</b>,  porque ese mismo año se vence la
Beca y no puedo dejar pasar la fecha.  Debido
a esto, decidí tomar la iniciativa de emprender una <b>campaña pro
recaudación de fondos con Indiegogo, ""One Step For Angel""</b>  Los fondos
recaudados serán destinados a cubrir los gastos necesarios.  Espero recaudar lo suficiente  para lograr mantenerme al menos un año
estudiando.</p>

de ser un sueño y se convertirá en una realidad.  Por grande o pequeña que

</div></div>","BRIEF REVIEW

My name isAngel Irizarry, and I am a
Dominican Musician. In early 2015, seeking to fulfill my
biggest dream, I applied to the prestigious college of music,Berklee and got average academic
scholarship.  Few months later, I
got some support from my country’s Ministry of Education and the Latin Grammy Foundation.
Thanks to them, I completed the academic scholarship.
However, they still
lackUS$20,000 since this
scholarship does not cover maintenance and must be enrolled for the 2016
Summer (by May)because
the grant expires and I cannot let it pass. So, because of this crucial
reason, I decided to start a Pro-Fundraising Campaign with
Indiegogo called “One Step for Angel!” All the proceeds will be used
to cover the necessary expenses. Hopefully, we will achieve, at least, a year
for studying.
I've waited my
whole life for this unique opportunity, and with your help and support,
this will be possible and will become a reality. Your contribution (big or
small) will make a difference... and it will become a big step.




YOUR
GIFT OF APPRECIATION:
I would like to show you my appreciation by offering guitar
lessons! You can choose your class throught different ways (Skype, Google Video) You can send me a
message specifying what exactly would you like to achieve and I
will do my best to teach you!




INVESTMENT OF COLLECTED FOUNDS
The estimated goal is US $ 20,000.00
of which US $ 1,000.00 Indiegogo will retain for the service
agreement page.
With the remaining funds, I can pay for my
first year of maintenance, as well as, travelling costs, local
transportation, buy computers and software that requires Berklee, books, health
insurance and other added expenses.

THE IMPACT
The music is a tie that binds people to people, from
my early days as a student and as a teacher, I could see how it transforms
people, and ultimately, I would like that my music transcends
borders. With your help you will be helping to spread this universal language
and transforming lives through music.
I am very grateful that Berklee has been fixed in my
work, who has valued my talent and my compositions, it is a big commitment that
I accept. I take great pride in my music and accept this great
opportunity to demonstrate my roots and show the great artistic
diversity of the Dominican culture.

I'm really anxious to see, with your help, the results of this career,
to continue creating, composing, playing my music to feel the adrenaline that
gives and the thrill of hearing the applause at each stage.





RISKS AND CHALLENGES

After the first year, I shall be able to work and seek more
opportunities to continue paying such expenses over the next years of the career.
After all, at the end of this Indiegogo’s campaing first stage, they provide
the option to continue raising funds through its associated page called InDemand.
Even if we cannot collect the necessary funds, I, at least, hope
to be able to cover main registration costs, and after that, figure my way up
by myself! 
You can help make a difference!




OTHER WAYS YOU CAN
HELP

You can also help me by sharing the link of my Indiegogo’s
campaing ""One Step For Angel"". I’ll also be presenting concerts. Go
to my site on these social networks, give me one ""Like and Share"" and use the #onstepforangel Hashtag throught Facebook,
Twitter and Instagram. 
There is no small contribution, your help give me a
big push in my career.

<h3>Ghosts from Two Towns Over</h3>
<p>My name is Kevin Michael Thompson and I am in the finishing stages of recording my newest record-Ghosts from Two Towns Over. This is a record that I am really proud of. I’ve been working on some of these songs for over ten years and some of them were finished during the recording process.</p>
</div><div>
<p> </p>
<h3>How You Can Help</h3>
<p>In the past,  I have always self-released and self-funded my records. This meant that I had a whole bunch of creative freedom but it also was extremely limiting as I could not bring in outside musicians, engineers and production help.</p>
<p>I want to be able to represent these songs in the best way that I can which means I need to have other ears on the project to help me mix, master and finalize the record. </p>
<p>Your help also enables me to hire a graphic artist and photographer for the record cover.</p>
<p>I also want to be able to do the things that a good release should have such as videos, promotional materials, tee-shirts, stickers and all of that good stuff! </p>
<p>And while having a digital record is important-I really need to create physical CDs and that is the bulk of the expense. The recording is almost done and I am almost ready to send the record to be mix, mastered and into production.</p>
</div><div>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I invited a bunch of great musicians to play on the record. Players from all over the country as well from Europe, Canada and even Israel. I’ve also been able to place a few of these songs on television and hope to do even more of that</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Danny Wright, I'm a singer songwriter from Reading in the UK, currently living in London. I've been writing songs since I picked up the guitar at 14 years old and have ever since loved music. My passion for writing and performing has grown over the years and has led to some amazing experiences from touring in bands, sharing the stage with my favourite bands and even performing at Wembley arena!!. Over the years I have always self funded my career while balancing jobs and bills, as an independent musician it at times can be very difficult and can leave you feeling jaded and down. A few times I have wanted to stop doing music all together. After a horrible yet eye opening incident last year I ended up in therapy sessions, my passion for music was cemented and I have written some of the best songs of my life.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This campaign will allow me to release these songs that are so important to me in their best format and will allow for a great music video that showcases the songs in their best light.<br/><br/><br/><br/>With your help I can continue what feels like the beginning of a magical, exciting, new chapter of my musical journey.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The funded will go towards a music video which will be shoot with an awesome production company who have worked with many of todays top UK artists. The funds will also go towards Marketing and PR, making sure the EP is in the right places and getting heard by the right people</p>
<p>Im really excited about these perks, I love writing, I love performing, I love creating and I love talking to you and getting to know you</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All these perks will involve you in this journey, I document almost everything I am doing from recording to filming to writing. And with the power of live streaming you guys can watch this campaign grow with me.</p>
<p>If the target is not met the funds will go towards maintenance of music equipment, guitars, amps, recording set up and rehearsal sessions.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>My journey has been amazing so far and I am so grateful for the support and experiences, I really believe that if this target is met then it will take me to the next level and really help me bring these visions to life and create some amazing art    </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The music industry can be a costly and very risky challenge to make a sustainable career out of. (trust me, Im broke!) BUT I dont believe that should stop anyone chasing their dreams. There is strength and power in support!</p>

My journey has been amazing so far and I am so grateful for the support and experiences, I really believe that if this target is met then it will take me to the next level and really help me bring these visions to life and create some amazing art    

Risks & Challenges
The music industry can be a costly and very risky challenge to make a sustainable career out of. (trust me, Im broke!) BUT I dont believe that should stop anyone chasing their dreams. There is strength and power in support!

We were very apprehensive since people simply don't buy CDs anymore and the music industry has very little interest in music, but THEY WON! We had to accommodate these lovely people, and we are now proud to present to you with the first official release of Benoit Viellefon Hot Club, a Hot Jazz &amp; Gypsy Swing album packed with the sounds of the small bands of the 1930’s and 1940’s.</p><p>Here is the ne album! We have tried to replicate that raw energy of the live shows in the studio. Without alcohol and women, it was bound to be a real challenge but somehow it happened.

We recorded a total 22 songs over 3 days, with most of the band’s regular musicians, so it reflects the ever flexible line up, with sometimes piano or guitar, and violin or trumpet plus inevitably double bass, and myself on guitar and vocals.

<h3>About me</h3>
<p>I am a musician, composer and percussion tutor based in London with more than ten years of experience. I am specialised multi-percussionist; some of the percussions I am playing are the Drum kit, Darbuka, Daouli, Djembe, etc. I hold a BA (Hons) Music degree from Middlesex University of London and Certificates from Trinity College London with excellent grades. I work as a member of music bands as a percussionist, I accompany various dance companies and I am the exclusive composer and music consultant for <i>imprint dancES </i>Dance Company. My debut album was released in March 2015 under the name <i>T.I.M.E. </i>and in September of 2016 I released three EPs online <i>(Trio., Sahara )</i> including the second release of <i>T.I.M.E.</i></p>
<h3><strong>The Book Project</strong></h3>
<p>In 2015 I decided to collect all the information and knowledge I've gained along my journey in Darbuka playing.</p>
<p>My idea was to create a syllabus for those who want to learn to play this amazing instrument. The reason is that is very hard to find a book based on Darbuka. Alongside my teaching career I've met students who are fascinated by Darbuka, even though they are not coming from Middle East.</p>
<p>So, after one year of working on this project, I am happy to announce that I'm holding my final draft in my hands!</p>
<p>My book is written in English so that anyone around the world can read it as there is limited access to books about Darbuka worldwide. 'Darbuka in Middle East' is written in plain language and everyone can have access to it, whatever his age or gender is. By reading the book, the reader can easily learn how to play the Darbuka by himself or even if he knows the right way, he can improve his skills and broaden his knowledge. </p>
<p>The publishing of this book is very important to me because in this way I can transfer my knowledge on the Darbuka to those who want to learn how to play this particular instrument and make them learn about Middle East music. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>However the publishing company cannot cover all the costs for publishing and marketing the book.</p>
<p>As I am a new author they ask me to share with them the costs of the book.</p>
<p>So to publish my book on a paperback of 2000 copies &amp; E- book Edition I need to cover the amount of £1900.</p>
<p>The Production Programme and the Marketing Plan of the book publishing are available to anyone who wants to have a look and contribute. </p>
<p>The publisher will deliver a copy of my book to the British Library and include it in the British National Bibliography. They will also deliver a copy of the book to the University Libraries at Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh, Aberystwyth and Dublin. </p>

The theme of the album is based on the concept of Truth, to reflect the name of our group - Axiom.  Each track on the album contains the thread to the idea of Truth or lack of Truth. 
A unified sound with specially written transitions between each track, with one song morphing into the next. To achieve these effects, we are working with only one composer and arranger, Karl Blench.

The Album will be a cohesive single work rather than a collection of songs. The end of the album will transition to the beginning creating endless listening pleasure. 
We are excited to release our album with Parma Recordings, one of the finest labels in the record industry. PARMA will also release our album on Navona and will be distributed by Naxos. 
We will be working on the album in one of the best studios in Houston - Wire Road Studios, with engineer Andrew Bradley, who has decades of experience with the world’s best musicians, and some of the best equipment in town.
 Track ListTo whet your appetite for this exciting album even more, here is the list of songs you’ll hear:
Haywyre, “Insight”
Claudio Monteverdi, “Pur Ti Miro”
Fleetwood Mac, “Little Lies”
Charles Ives, “The Alcotts”
Elliott Smith, “Everything Means Nothing to Me”
Karl Blench, Original composition, title TBA
Billie Holiday, “Don't Explain”
Johann Sebastian Bach, “Erbarme dich”
Bob Dylan/Old Crow Medicine Show, “Wagon Wheel”
This album is only the beginning of really big things to come in our next five years. Join us in making this album, and you can tell all your friends about how you ""knew Axiom when..."" Critical Acclaim""The Axiom Quartet™ has become a fixture on Houston's classical music scene. It was the concerts the quartet played at the Cave Without a Name that became the model for the kind of programs the group likes to present - shorter pieces between five and 10 minutes in length. 'We were the very first strictly classical ensemble to play [at the Cave],' Moore says. 'And every time we go out there we have a fully sold-out cave.'""~ Houston Chronicle""I LOVE These Guys/Gals!! Wanted them for my Daughter's wedding/Shower, but the dates didn't work out! I Get to hear them on Wed. At the Airport!! They are Passionate, Current, and Wonderful!!!"" ~ Tracey“We just wanted to express our delight and appreciation for the thoughtfulness of your concert mix. As non-musicians the selection of pieces we are not familiar with, sometimes a stretch for us, combined with more contemporary, entertaining numbers, always leaves us wanting to return to your concerts. Also, your obvious delight and courtesy towards each other, coupled with your concern for us by each speaking about the next piece is most helpful. Keep up the good work!” ~ Vic and Dee Use of Funds

<h3>PURE AXESS</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1538780790/lca8xcnj2ppjfj2nhhrl.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>WHY THIS MATTERS</strong></h3>
<p>70% of youth stop attending church after they graduate from high school. If you aren’t aware of this phenomenon, our children and grandchildren (born after 1999) are poised to leave the Christian community in record numbers as they grow up. </p>
<p>One of the reasons why this is happening is because there are very few Christian online platforms and apps that provide the music, sports and entertainment that they love – on the mobile and web platforms that they use every day. </p>
<p>In the past, Christians have pioneered and leveraged new media so that every person can hear the message of Christ. Today, we have an opportunity to extend that message and engage our youth using the most common platform in the world: the mobile phone.</p>
<p>We want our children and grandchildren to be happy, healthy and whole. With a strong foundation in Christ, they are more likely to make good decisions throughout their lives. If they are not engaged in a positive and constructive way (such as through our mobile app), then they are at risk of finding other outlets that may take them down the wrong road.</p>
<h3><strong>THE VISION</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>With the capital raised through this campaign, we will launch a mobile app offering unique content and experiences to engage this generation of young Christians to come together and enjoy relevant Christian talent and entertainment. </p>
<p>We are building a connected and interactive Christian community through music, sports, ministry, and beyond. Our vision is for people of all ages to find relevant information and entertainment through this mobile app that will draw their attention, entertain and answer questions they have about their faith. The app will also connect those looking for a church home with Bible-based churches in their local area.</p>
<div><h3><strong>THE NEXT STEP</strong></h3></div>
<div>
<p>Great news— we’ve completed the initial version of the app to live-stream music and sports on iPhones. This is completely paid for, and the next phase is to complete the app for iPhones and build a version for Android phones. </p>
<p>Our $250k fundraising goal will help us finalize the existing iPhone app and adapt the app for Android phones. Beyond that, the funds will go towards creating content for advertising on social media platforms to reach our audience of young adults and teenagers and encourage them to download the app on their phones. This part is critical because of how active this group is across social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat— they are easily reached on there and therefore more receptive to hearing our message.</p>
<p>A sneak peek of how the app looks:</p>

<p> </p>
<h3><strong style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>THE POWER OF MUSIC TO REACH YOUTH</strong></h3>
</div>
<p>Christian and gospel music is one of the fastest-growing areas in recorded music history, according to Business Insider. </p>
<p>More and more music is being purchased and streamed through mobile devices, and in the digital age, live experiences are more important than ever. Audiences are hungry for singular experiences, and they want to be part of these shared moments. We are adapting to the technology and social media revolution to create a more engaging experience.</p>
<p>As Rick McDonnell at Harmony Passion puts it; “what is it about music that connects people in such diverse areas of life?  I'm sure there are many ways to explain it, but I attribute it to this: that God has placed His image within the heart and mind of man. I believe God is musical, and has given man the ability to use this gift of music. This attribute is universal, not limited by language, culture, or occupation. This is how we can connect to anyone through music.""</p>
<p>“Music communicates on a deeper level than any other form of communication— it engages the soul,” says Jason Howard, Amplify's senior associate pastor. “My connection with God began through music when I was a teenager.”</p>
<p><strong>MOBILE</strong> - More and more music is being purchased and streamed through mobile devices.      Any experience created must operate on the mobile platform.</p>

<strong>THE POWER OF LIVE</strong> - In the Age of Digital - Live is more important than ever...Audiences are hungry for singular  experiences. They want to be part of these shared moments.  “Music Fans Want Experiences Over Downloads According to Nielsen Report.” *Sept 2016</li>

<p>*Must Be Approved By Artist</p>
<div><p><strong>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</strong></p></div>
<p>Obviously our greatest risk is that we will not reach our funding goal.  Should that happen I will continue to seek ways to fund this app to completion. Our biggest challenge will be to secure the talent needed to attract young people to the app and to continually create new content that will keep them coming back.  </p>
<p><strong>CHARITY</strong></p>
<p>Donating to the causes you care about not only benefits the charities themselves, it can be deeply rewarding for us as well. Millions of people give to charity on a regular basis to support causes they believe in, as well as for the positive effect it has on their own lives.</p>
<p>We believe in Charity.  We will strongly encourage each Christian celebrity involved in AXESS CHRISTIAN to donate a portion of their fees earned through our app to the Christian Charity of their choice.  During certain live streamed events users will have the opportunity to donate a few $$ to their chosen charity if they so choose.  In addition a portion our our $$ will also go to a Christian charity.  Each time you sign up for a paid event a portion of your $$ will go to charity.  Keep in mind most of the fees for events will be just a few dollars but it all adds up.  Our Charities will be listed on our website and our app.</p>
<p>As Martin Luther so eloquently put it: ""Christian life consists in faith and charity""</p>

<p>My name is Mark McVey.  My wife Madeleine and I have 5 awesome children and 7 perfect grandchildren.  At least we think so.  Their parents may not agree at times.</p>
<p>I spent the better part of 40 years in the business world.  Prior to starting my own medical company in 1992  which I was in the finance industry.  After almost 25 years growing my company I felt a new calling.  I transitioned into the ministry with the local church I attended.   I  love my church and I love the ministry but I still felt a calling that was greater and I transitioned my ministry this year and set out to see what God had in mind for me.  I was only good at a few things, I love the Lord, I love people and I know business.  How can I combine these to impact His kingdom?  Only a few months later I began the journey to PURE AXESS.</p>
<p>My wife and I lead a Young Adult Group at our church and we have become passionate about making a difference in the lives of young Christians and those window shopping.  My prayer is that others will be as passionate as I am about the mission of this app.</p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>So here we are.  You know my story and the story behind PURE AXESS.   I guess the best way to summarize this is let you know right up front that building an app is not in my wheel house, not even close.  So I have been blessed with a team of experts who do what they do best, build a killer app and offer me the best possible technical, professional and spiritual advice.  Here is a little background on our team:</span></p>
<p>The Development Team behind AXESS CHRISTIAN has developed and published some of the biggest video game franchises in the world, with lifetime sales of over $6.5 billion worldwide.</p>
<p>Our Advisory Team has extensive global expertise in building brands, platforms, programs and partnerships in sports, media and entertainment. </p>
<p>Our Talent Development Partner is a 45 + year veteran of the international entertainment industry.  Based in Nashville Tennessee, he has worked in all areas of entertainment, and has worked in various capacities for a long list of dignitaries and recording artists from around the world. </p>
<p>I saved my most special adviser for last.  Some of you know him very well and all of you have at least heard of Him.  He goes by many names but I call him Heavenly Father.  As Paul puts it, “God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that having all sufficiency in all things at all times, you may abound in every good work” (2 Cor. 9:8). God doesn’t call us to something only to leave us to fend for ourselves. He is with us, he provides for us, and he enables us to finish the assignment.</p>
<p>If we reach our goal of $250,000 it will allow us to properly launch this app and allow us the resources to take it World Wide.  But this is only the beginning.  If we exceed our goal this will allow us to move to begin future experiences.  </p>
<p>It is my belief that through this app we can reach and engage the next generation of Christians.  I pray that you will join me on this mission.  Lets build this thing and then see what God can do with it.  And as one of my favorite teaching pastors say s and I paraphrase, ""help us to make Jesus famous"".</p>
<p><strong>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP</strong></p>
<p>To all of you who help us achieve our goal I am eternally grateful.  But there are additional ways that you can help.  Please help us get the word out to your family, friends, churches, businesses and social media.  You know how compound interest works in finance, well this works the same way.  If you send this to 5 people who send it to 5 people who send it to 5 people, well you get where I am going.  </p>
<p>Thank you for your time and blessings to each of you.</p>

In the past, Christians have pioneered and leveraged new media so that every person can hear the message of Christ. Today, we have an opportunity to extend that message and engage our youth using the most common platform in the world: the mobile phone.
We want our children and grandchildren to be happy, healthy and whole. With a strong foundation in Christ, they are more likely to make good decisions throughout their lives. If they are not engaged in a positive and constructive way (such as through our mobile app), then they are at risk of finding other outlets that may take them down the wrong road.
THE VISION

With the capital raised through this campaign, we will launch a mobile app offering unique content and experiences to engage this generation of young Christians to come together and enjoy relevant Christian talent and entertainment. 
We are building a connected and interactive Christian community through music, sports, ministry, and beyond. Our vision is for people of all ages to find relevant information and entertainment through this mobile app that will draw their attention, entertain and answer questions they have about their faith. The app will also connect those looking for a church home with Bible-based churches in their local area.
THE NEXT STEP

Great news— we’ve completed the initial version of the app to live-stream music and sports on iPhones. This is completely paid for, and the next phase is to complete the app for iPhones and build a version for Android phones. 
Our $250k fundraising goal will help us finalize the existing iPhone app and adapt the app for Android phones. Beyond that, the funds will go towards creating content for advertising on social media platforms to reach our audience of young adults and teenagers and encourage them to download the app on their phones. This part is critical because of how active this group is across social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat— they are easily reached on there and therefore more receptive to hearing our message.
A sneak peek of how the app looks:

 
THE POWER OF MUSIC TO REACH YOUTH

Christian and gospel music is one of the fastest-growing areas in recorded music history, according to Business Insider. 
More and more music is being purchased and streamed through mobile devices, and in the digital age, live experiences are more important than ever. Audiences are hungry for singular experiences, and they want to be part of these shared moments. We are adapting to the technology and social media revolution to create a more engaging experience.
As Rick McDonnell at Harmony Passion puts it; “what is it about music that connects people in such diverse areas of life?  I'm sure there are many ways to explain it, but I attribute it to this: that God has placed His image within the heart and mind of man. I believe God is musical, and has given man the ability to use this gift of music. This attribute is universal, not limited by language, culture, or occupation. This is how we can connect to anyone through music.""
“Music communicates on a deeper level than any other form of communication— it engages the soul,” says Jason Howard, Amplify's senior associate pastor. “My connection with God began through music when I was a teenager.”
MOBILE - More and more music is being purchased and streamed through mobile devices.      Any experience created must operate on the mobile platform.


THE POWER OF LIVE - In the Age of Digital - Live is more important than ever...Audiences are hungry for singular  experiences. They want to be part of these shared moments.  “Music Fans Want Experiences Over Downloads According to Nielsen Report.” *Sept 2016

BUSINESS MODEL TRANSFORMATION - The future business model needs to adapt to the technology and social media revolution in order to create a more engaging experience.

SCREENSHOTS: These are actual screen shots from the app

 
MUSIC DELIVERY THROUGH THE APP

Through our app, we will offer unique events by top Christian artists such as:
Live-streamed backstage events before and/or after a live show

We will connect those looking for a church home with bible based churches in their area.
Frequently Asked Questions:
Frequently Asked Questions about Life and Religion:Through the app, today’s Christian leaders will present video answers to frequently asked questions by youth. Young Christians need their questions addressed by top Christian leaders relatable to their age and stage in life. We are not changing the message, just the medium through which it is delivered.
We will also address topical issues such as:

Relationships/Marriage
Education
Career
Fitness
Health
Trends
Issues not listed above that are important to youth

Our focus throughout this app will be to always consider the needs of others and show them what true Christian love and unity is like as we engage with them.

RISKS AND CHALLENGES
Obviously our greatest risk is that we will not reach our funding goal.  Should that happen I will continue to seek ways to fund this app to completion. Our biggest challenge will be to secure the talent needed to attract young people to the app and to continually create new content that will keep them coming back.  
CHARITY
Donating to the causes you care about not only benefits the charities themselves, it can be deeply rewarding for us as well. Millions of people give to charity on a regular basis to support causes they believe in, as well as for the positive effect it has on their own lives.
We believe in Charity.  We will strongly encourage each Christian celebrity involved in AXESS CHRISTIAN to donate a portion of their fees earned through our app to the Christian Charity of their choice.  During certain live streamed events users will have the opportunity to donate a few $$ to their chosen charity if they so choose.  In addition a portion our our $$ will also go to a Christian charity.  Each time you sign up for a paid event a portion of your $$ will go to charity.  Keep in mind most of the fees for events will be just a few dollars but it all adds up.  Our Charities will be listed on our website and our app.
As Martin Luther so eloquently put it: ""Christian life consists in faith and charity""

 
TO SUMMARIZE

My name is Mark McVey.  My wife Madeleine and I have 5 awesome children and 7 perfect grandchildren.  At least we think so.  Their parents may not agree at times.
I spent the better part of 40 years in the business world.  Prior to starting my own medical company in 1992  which I was in the finance industry.  After almost 25 years growing my company I felt a new calling.  I transitioned into the ministry with the local church I attended.   I  love my church and I love the ministry but I still felt a calling that was greater and I transitioned my ministry this year and set out to see what God had in mind for me.  I was only good at a few things, I love the Lord, I love people and I know business.  How can I combine these to impact His kingdom?  Only a few months later I began the journey to PURE AXESS.
My wife and I lead a Young Adult Group at our church and we have become passionate about making a difference in the lives of young Christians and those window shopping.  My prayer is that others will be as passionate as I am about the mission of this app.
So here we are.  You know my story and the story behind PURE AXESS.   I guess the best way to summarize this is let you know right up front that building an app is not in my wheel house, not even close.  So I have been blessed with a team of experts who do what they do best, build a killer app and offer me the best possible technical, professional and spiritual advice.  Here is a little background on our team:
The Development Team behind AXESS CHRISTIAN has developed and published some of the biggest video game franchises in the world, with lifetime sales of over $6.5 billion worldwide.
Our Advisory Team has extensive global expertise in building brands, platforms, programs and partnerships in sports, media and entertainment. 
Our Talent Development Partner is a 45 + year veteran of the international entertainment industry.  Based in Nashville Tennessee, he has worked in all areas of entertainment, and has worked in various capacities for a long list of dignitaries and recording artists from around the world. 
I saved my most special adviser for last.  Some of you know him very well and all of you have at least heard of Him.  He goes by many names but I call him Heavenly Father.  As Paul puts it, “God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that having all sufficiency in all things at all times, you may abound in every good work” (2 Cor. 9:8). God doesn’t call us to something only to leave us to fend for ourselves. He is with us, he provides for us, and he enables us to finish the assignment.
If we reach our goal of $250,000 it will allow us to properly launch this app and allow us the resources to take it World Wide.  But this is only the beginning.  If we exceed our goal this will allow us to move to begin future experiences.  
It is my belief that through this app we can reach and engage the next generation of Christians.  I pray that you will join me on this mission.  Lets build this thing and then see what God can do with it.  And as one of my favorite teaching pastors say s and I paraphrase, ""help us to make Jesus famous"".
OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP
To all of you who help us achieve our goal I am eternally grateful.  But there are additional ways that you can help.  Please help us get the word out to your family, friends, churches, businesses and social media.  You know how compound interest works in finance, well this works the same way.  If you send this to 5 people who send it to 5 people who send it to 5 people, well you get where I am going.  
Thank you for your time and blessings to each of you.

<h2><strong>Hi, I'm a folk singer from Kingston, ON.</strong></h2>
<p>I started playing and writing music when I was about 14. I've played in rock bands, blues bands, and even a fairly bad punk band, but my acoustic guitar and performing as a solo artist has always been my staple.<strong> </strong>I play somewhere around 100 shows a year these days. <strong>After 25 years of performing and writing music, it's finally time to put out an album.</strong><br/><br/>Sure, I recorded a couple of tapes in high school, but they are mostly lost and awful. So, for all intents and purposes, <strong>this is my first album.</strong>  And I'm crazy excited to get it done and into your ears. </p>
<p>I'm not a prolific songwriter, but I try to write 'em well. Most of these songs have been tested in front of hundreds of audiences, either solo or with one of my bands (Strung Out To Dry or The Goodnight Irenes). That said, I'm too close to the songs, so I asked <strong>one of Kingston's best and hardest working musicians, Tom Savage, to produce this record.</strong> I was immediately impressed with Tom's work as producer of Al Duquette's solo album last year, and I asked him right away if he'd like to be a part of it. Tom really has a fantastic ear for these songs, sometimes bringing them exactly where I wanted them, other times pushing them in exciting new directions.</p>
<h2><strong>About the album and this campaign</strong></h2>
<p>As you probably know, any musician can record their songs pretty much anywhere, what with computers and all. But it often doesn't sound very good. So, seeing as I've waited over 20 years to do this, I want you to think it's a great folk album. That's why I have a great producer, a great engineer, and some incredible backing musicians. About half the songs were recorded at the beautiful North of Princess Studio, the others at Kevin Bowers' studio nearby. I also have plans to do a music video, and some merch, both of which are firsts for me!  </p>
<p>All told, it's going to cost about $3500. My goal with this campaign is to sell as many records in advance as possible. I've worked hard and put together a great team to make an album that I'm extremely proud of, and I'm excited for you to be a part of this musical journey with me.  <strong>PLUS, all of the perks over $10 for this campaign come with an exclusive outtake that will only be available to backers. </strong>You can also follow along here for videos from some of the recording sessions.</p>
<h2><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h2>
<p>If you aren't able to contribute now, please follow along anyway, share with your friends on social media, and help spread the word! I'll be posting regular updates with some footage from the studio, as well as details on the CD release concert, merch availability, and more. Thank you!</p>

I wanted to focus less on releasing in quantity, and focus more on releasing quality. Tracks that I could stand behind for years, and tracks that I wouldn't get sick of by the time they had been released (the release process can sometimes take months).

It has been described as cinematic, vast, epic, emotional and many other things. Musically it sits somewhere between dub, drum & bass, ambient, dub-techno, downtempo, chill out, post dubstep, deep techno and bass.I have spent around 10 years making and releasing music. First under the alias DFRNT, and now under the name Stillhead. As DFRNT, there were 4 albums, 20 or so EPs, stacks of remixes and compilation appearances alongside my Echodub and Cut labelsIn 2013, I decided that I wanted to make a shift in my production work. I wanted to focus less on releasing in quantity, and focus more on releasing quality. Tracks that I could stand behind for years, and tracks that I wouldn't get sick of by the time they had been released (the release process can sometimes take months). Stillhead (and a new label: Brightest Dark Place) was born.With Stillhead I have tried very carefully to release quality over quantity, and as a result it's been almost 2 years since I released my debut album ""Iceberg"". It's about a year since my last EP (the Spiders EP), and to date, there have only been a handful of remixes, a few compilation appearances, and aside from a short film soundtrack, not much else.CopenhagenThe time has come, however, to release another collection of tracks. This time produced around and during the time I spent in the Danish capital city, Copenhagen.It seemed fitting to give the album the name ""Copenhagen"", and the release will serve as something of a catalogue of my time there. I'd almost call it a tribute, but I'm not sure I can do the city justice with my humble productions.New Original TracksI have created 10 brand new, previously unheard original Stillhead tracks, including a collaboration with a new Estonian vocalist, a track with previous collaborator and woozy rap aficionado Mu Vonz, and a track co-written and produced with a good friend and recent father Lee Chapman. RemixesNot content with just a single disc's worth of audio, I have also sourced remixes from some of the producers who I really respect and enjoy right now. These include Bop, Hatti Vatti, Versa, Tonik Ensemble, Mr. Roque, Another Channel, Other Spectrum and Generate.Alongside these remixes, I have also provided a couple of alternate versions and re-edits of my own to round out the package.All in all, it's a 20-track offering, which I hope fills people's ears, minds and hearts.The ReleaseMy first album, Iceberg felt like it went a little under the radar.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm Jay, I was born in Northern New Jersey. I've had some troubles, but decided that rather than being ashamed of it, I'd embrace and write music to try and connect with other people who maybe grew up depressed or feeling hopeless. Music was never the plan, but it kept creeping into the background until I had no choice but to embrace it. I hope that if you know me, my music can tell the story better than I can. And if you don't, I hope something resonates with you.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Every hour of recording is usually 100 dollars. A friend of a friend is willing to record for half of that. Mixing is usually 150-300 a song. To record a song, under perfect conditions, will stay take nearly a full day of recording. I'm hoping to be able to rent the studio for a week, record 8 songs, have them mixed, mastered, and begin playing shows around Los Angeles, and eventually the country. I have some solid people in my corner, I simply need to record this album. Any leftover money will help with living expenses, as I quite literally am putting everything I have into this. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I don't believe there's a sincere voice in music to represent the disenfranchised, marginalized, forgotten folks of this generation, the next, or the last. There's been a lot of bad times, but I think I've found a way to translate those struggles into something beautiful.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I will probably end up living in my car-- blissful, happy, and content. All I want is for my music to have integrity, I don't very much care about anything else right now.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Share this campaign, donate if you can, and definitely look forward to new music coming very soon. Thank you, lots of love, and all the best to each of you. Also, feel free to reach out if you or someone you know is struggling.. I'll do my best to help..</p>

<h3>My Beautiful Friends,</h3>
<p>                                                     I'm Sioux Robbins, a singer songwriter and piano player. I grew up listening to so many styles of music and it all just stayed in my ears. The first song I taught myself on piano when I was about 5 years old was the intro to My Girl, it runs straight across the black keys, and it was all uphill from there. My mother put me and my older sister, who was also musical, in the Performing Arts School of the Philadelphia Dance Academy where I met Mrs. Mary Hardy. She was a piano teacher and ethnomusicologist who also taught at Juliard. She would show me a few tricks, help me work through an obstacle and then back out of the way. I was so headstrong about what I wanted to play. It was there where I wrote my first serious composition at age twelve, and it was also there where I first studied classical voice and learned about the great jazz vocalists. As an adult I went on to perform in clubs and lounges singing jazz standards for a while. But I reached a point where I just wanted play my originals. My influences range from Debussey to B.B. King via Miles Davis. From Nina Simone to Joni Mitchell. With the Beatles, Paul Simon, Antonio Carlos Jobim, and Lionel Ritchie thrown in for good measure. As a young woman I hung out with Gil Scott-Heron on numerous occasions and often played my songs for him. He taught me some very important things about lyric writing that I've kept as my foundation when I approach writing a song. These days I'm studying with renowned vocal coach Owen Brown Jr. who has coached Mary J. Blige, Jill Scott, Wyclef Jean, Teddy Pendergrass, and numerous other successful recording artists and stage performers.</p>
<p>                                                        Call me a late bloomer. Getting this album made has been a long time coming. The late, wonderful Wayne Dyer said: ""Don't die with your music still in you."" I know for a fact he was talking directly to me. And this project is just the beginning of me not dying with my music still in me. Here's the link to listen to the demo tracks of half the album.</p>

<h3>Who is Lew Sid?</h3>
<p>From the 757, the soul of<strong> Virginia</strong>, I am a super creative Hip-Hop artist/songwriter. <strong>Born on my parents last hope</strong> <strong>after failing twice, I believe my life's purpose</strong> <strong>is to deliver my story through music</strong>. This past year I've become so much more, a Father myself, life has tested me in many ways and I spill out all my experiences in my music. Saga One was released in the winter of 2016. <strong>100% independent,</strong> we conquered so much with that project. I was blessed to have my singles ""Whole Squad"" and ""How You Feelin' ?""featured on worldwide radio like Shade45, played at NBA games, countless clubs and gained so many listeners and supporters. My music saw amazing numbers on streaming sites like Spotify and Apple Music. I've performed some amazing shows and opened for artists like Rick Ross and T.I.. <strong>Music is my life and I work as hard as possible to keep my product building and still get chills at the chance to share it with the world</strong>.</p>
<p>Your contribution and support here will play a huge role in helping me to do it all again, but on a bigger scale, with more capabilities. These songs not only share my story, they inspire my listeners, paint different perspectives. So much of me is in this music, and to get this project to it's peak potential, <strong>I certainly need the help of not just supporters of Lew, but fans of the art of music as well!</strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What do you gain by supporting?</h3>
<p><strong>Everyone who supports this campaign will be given reward options</strong> depending on how much you chose to contribute. That ranges from invites to the private listening/release party, to merchandise, to exclusive complete packages! The decision on how much to contribute and what <i>Perk</i> you would like in return is completely your choice<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Not reaching my goals would hinder my process some, but all money gained will still be put towards the effort.<strong> I've learned so much on my quest and the financial side was so key that I know how important this is, </strong>and don't want to fall short of the capabilities I can reach that I know the art can attain. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Lacking the financial backing of a label, as a indie Artist, working a 9-5 with my first born daughter, <strong>getting the craft to its full ability and in the markets in needs to be in becomes expensive.</strong> This sometimes requires a call for help from supporters, believers, to aid in this process while at this level so the work reaches the pinnacle its capable of. As i've said, music is my life, this isn't a hobbie and I invest all I can and all of myself into it. My goal as an artist is to stay true to myself and those around me as we build, something rare in todays industry due to what most will do for money, or support.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute, <strong>you can still show your support by SHARING THIS CAMPAIGN</strong> any and everywhere possible. Regardless of who it is,<strong> I urge your support anyone you like in the arts</strong>, hopefully this time or one day it will be me! It isn't easy being a creative and definitely isn't cheap. Spread love!</p>

Everyone who supports this campaign will be given reward options depending on how much you chose to contribute. That ranges from invites to the private listening/release party, to merchandise, to exclusive complete packages! The decision on how much to contribute and what Perk you would like in return is completely your choice.
Not reaching my goals would hinder my process some, but all money gained will still be put towards the effort. I've learned so much on my quest and the financial side was so key that I know how important this is, and don't want to fall short of the capabilities I can reach that I know the art can attain. 

The Impact
Lacking the financial backing of a label, as a indie Artist, working a 9-5 with my first born daughter, getting the craft to its full ability and in the markets in needs to be in becomes expensive. This sometimes requires a call for help from supporters, believers, to aid in this process while at this level so the work reaches the pinnacle its capable of. As i've said, music is my life, this isn't a hobbie and I invest all I can and all of myself into it. My goal as an artist is to stay true to myself and those around me as we build, something rare in todays industry due to what most will do for money, or support.

Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't contribute, you can still show your support by SHARING THIS CAMPAIGN any and everywhere possible. Regardless of who it is, I urge your support anyone you like in the arts, hopefully this time or one day it will be me! It isn't easy being a creative and definitely isn't cheap. Spread love!

<p>The vision of turning our original songs into a recorded album is finally becoming a reality.</p>
<p>Its been almost exactly a year since HO∆X was formed from the hallways of Hofstra. This year has been a roller coaster trying balance out college life, working full-time jobs, and letting the music evolve naturally and organically. After months of perfecting and deliberating, we finally feel like we are at the point where timing, music, and our overall goals all align so that we can make this album happen. And that is where you all come in!</p>

<p>Being an indie band doesn’t only mean that we make music of a certain style, but instead also means that we hold all the financial burdens of being a band and making music. Of course this independence comes with creative freedom and the ability for us to make an album that is truly representative of us as individuals, and also as a band. We really care about the music we make, in honesty we live the music we make, and it just a sonic extension of our beings. Obviously there is a financial breakdown of what we need in order to record this album, but we believe you should really know what you are buying into: </p>

Finalmente, mi madre me tomaba en sus brazos y me llevaba a otra habitación para alejarme del enchufe ya que yo no dejaba de intentarlo.
Algunas personas han dicho que nací sin instinto de conservación. Esta afirmación suele ser la preferida de las personas que tratan de entender como soy capaz de abandonarlo todo para ir detrás de mi sueño.
¿Cómo ha sido mi vida en los últimos años?
En esencia, he tratado de luchar por mis sueños:
Le envié mi disco al CEO de Warner Music Group - Edgar Bronfman Junior


Vendí todo lo que poseía, excepto mi guitarra y mi computador y me mude a Irlanda para intentar conseguir un record deal.
Estando en Irlanda le pedí trabajo a U2 para aprender todo sobre el negocio de la música
36 Days To Work For U2 - My Story
36 Days To Work For U2 - 1era. Parte

36 Days To Work For U2 - 2da. Parte




36 Days To Work For U2 - 3era. Parte


Sin embargo, a pesar de todo, NO LO LOGRÉ.
Volví a mi país, Uruguay, con mis sueños rotos y absolutamente quebrado tanto emocional como económicamente.
Me tomo 4 años recuperarme, y de hecho, siendo sincero aún trabajo en ello.
Muy probablemente muchas personas pensarían que después de todo lo que pase, ya tendría que haber aprendido mi lección, y ya en este punto, lo más probable es que hubiera aceptado mi realidad, abandonado mis sueños, y simplemente hecho lo que la mayoría hace: buscar un trabajo de 8 horas.
Pero resulta que nunca fui como la mayoría.
Seis años después de mi primer intento, volví a pedirle trabajo a U2; y  esta vez me dirigí a  Bono:

OneWishForChristmasBONO.com
Aún no he tenido respuesta.
Los que realmente me conocen a fondo, saben que jamás voy a parar hasta alcanzar mi sueño. Que jamás voy a desistir y que después de todo lo que he vivido, estoy más decido que nunca a grabar mi disco “Day 36”.
Es cierto…
Aun no soy conocido.
Aun no estoy en la radio.
Aun no toco en estadios.
Por lo cual he decidido comenzar con lo más importante con lo que cuenta un músico:
Con mi público.
Ustedes son mi primer público.
Ustedes son mis primeras raíces.
Ustedes son las primeras plumas.
Los necesito a USTEDES, mi público, para hacer cada vez más fuerte mi voz.
Hoy… ahora… en este mismo momento, ustedes pueden contribuir y ser parte de esta historia única en el mundo.
Hoy te pido a ti que me ayudes a grabar mi primer disco: Day 36. Te invito y te pido que seas parte de mi primer público.
¿Para qué necesito tu contribución?
Con tu contribución estarás apoyando la creación, grabación, filmación y publicación de mi Disco Day 36
Day 36 - Mi Disco
Day 36 es un disco, es una forma de vida y una forma de sentir.
Day 36 es una utopía y una realidad.
Day 36 es esa línea en el horizonte que nunca se alcanza pero que nos mantiene caminando.

Day 36 es la última pieza de mi primer puzle.

<p><b></b></p><p><b>Short Summary</b></p><p><i>In consideration of helping Beauregard &amp; the Down Right fund and properly promote a masterpiece sophomore record, here are a few key things:</i></p><ul>
<li><p>Beauregard &amp; the Down Right is a four-piece rock/reggae band fronted by songwriter Beauregard Higgins. Beauregard and the band have been working tirelessly for five years touring the United States. Beauregard and the Down Right's proverbial mission is to foster a musical brand that identifies with the current state of social climate while encouraging listeners to be compassionate, altruistic and empathetic human beings. Beauregard Higgins is an aspiring international songwriting who in the past year has performed and written music in Ireland, Scotland, England and in many other parts of the United Kingdom.  <br/></p></li>
<li><p>For samples of previous work by the project please visit this link. <a href=""https://www.reverbnation.com/beauregardmusic"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.reverbnation.com/beauregardmusic</a></p></li>

</li>
</ul><br/><ul>
<li><p>The purpose of this funding campaign is to empower Beauregard &amp; the Down Right with the monetary means to release to the public, potential peers and current affiliates a radio worthy, expertly produced sophomore record. A quality record of this scope will globally enable Beauregard &amp; the Downright to be placed in far-reaching independent and mainstream media, international festivals and industry standard, top-tier markets. The quality production of a sophomore record will be the next step for the band to excel to new heights in their endeavors.</p></li>
<li><p>Being a completely self-funded, grassroots, blue-collar band can be a tough position.  Being able to put out the best quality of music and promote an album where it will be seen and heard by the appropriate people is difficult if not impossible without resources to reach the next level. With contributions to this campaign from investors like you, Beauregard &amp; the Down Right could present proposals and secure contracts for international tours, record deals, public relations campaigns, and finally break through to the next level of a professional artist career.</p></li>

<li><p>The main goal of this funding venture is to bring to market a fully produced radio worthy sophomore record and begin a public relations campaign to promote it properly in the industry.</p></li>
<li><p>No contribution is too small, and the campaign has perks and incentive packages that work for any budget. $10 contributions will get a signed copy of the new album before it is available for commercial purchase. More generous contributions will be awarded  private event performances from the band in any private venue of your choosing including your home. The band even has perks where they will come out to  prepare a gourmet meal for you of your choosing (steak, lobster, vegan lobster...etc.) with masterful culinary skills!</p></li>
<li><p>In the event that the campaign does not reach the entire goal and does not secure the funds to begin a PR campaign, all contributed funds will still be used to finish the album and any perks ascertained by your contribution will still be honored regardless of the final amount.</p></li>
</ul><br/><br/><p><b>The Impact</b></p><p><i>We feel this record could have a positive impact on music fans for generations to come and could align the project with key players in the industry to propel the band into an international market:</i></p><ul>
<li><p>The band feels that these songs need to be heard around the world.  The quality of the band's new material has matured in lyrical content and heart grasping melodies. The music has already received a variety of professional exposure,  and the amounting fans around the world have expressed how touched they are by the message of the music.  We feel passionately about the impact this material could have on generations of music fans. It will inspire fans to show a simple kindness to one another and build a brighter future for the next to come.</p></li>
<li><p>Beauregard and the Down Right have never once solicited for help of this nature. The band has always been determined to do things independently since day one, building an extremely passionate and supportive fan base one town at a time by actually going out into the world and performing and sharing their ideas with people intimately.  The band has had rapid success in building a brand and being offered some amazing opportunities to support, on stage, some legendary international artists right out of the gate. </p></li>
<li><p>With that said, the time has come to really make these next steps as strategically as possible starting with the quality of every single musical release we put into the world. With the help of people like you on this funding campaign we believe we can really make a difference on this path we have chosen.</p></li>
</ul><br/><p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p><p><i>There will always be risks and hurdles to overcome with an artistic project, but we are confident that the project is prepared to excel:</i></p><ul>
<li><p>With any artistic endeavor there are obstacles to overcome. For example, finding the right company to work with to promote this album will be a challenge, as the band has no intentions of working with anyone that doesn’t wholeheartedly believe in the project, but we will find our team.<br/></p></li>
<li><p>The album that we will produce, with your help, will be a gateway for introduction to major international artist agencies such as William Morris Endeavor Agency, Free Trade Agency (London), and Red Ryder Entertainment to name a few.  Being able to start a relationship with agencies like these, we could most definitely embark on international tours with the proper support and press coverage needed to flourish in the industry. Without these kinds of connections in the industry we will certainly still be building one brick at a time, and now is the moment to take some big steps towards the future.</p></li>

<h3>About Me</h3>
<div>I am a lawyer turned entertainer, was born and raised outside of Chicago in Gary, Indiana. Although raised in the foster care system, I managed to escape the merry-go-round of foster homes that some children endure. As one of the lucky ones, I thrived in a loving family environment, surrounded by music, theater, and the arts.<br/><br/>I attended Indiana University in Bloomington where I began to develop my artistic abilities. Subsequently, I went on to earn a Juris Doctorate from the John Marshall Law School in Chicago and spent several years working for the Baltimore City States Attorney’s office where I prosecuted child abuse and domestic violence cases. Later, I joined the Law firm of Semmes Bowen &amp; Semmes, before starting my own firm of Collins &amp; Harris, and being called to the Ontario Bar.<br/><br/>As my passion for the arts grew, I put his legal career on hold, debuting in the Orpheus production of “Rent” in 2011 as a member of the ensemble and understudy for the role of Tom Collins. After moving to Tel Aviv, I burst into Israel’s English Language Theater as Seaweed J. Stubbs in “Hairspray,” followed by Audrey II in “Little Shop of Horrors,” and as Richie Walters in “A Chorus Line.”<br/><br/>In the spring of 2015 I appeared as Benjamin Coffin III in a concert version of Rent at the renowned Habima 4 stage in Tel Aviv, I reprised the role of Benny in Starcatcher’s production of “RENT” in Jerusalem. With your help I am sure to become a multi-faceted performer in the entertainment industry: theater, television, motion pictures, and music!!</div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Shooting a video can range in price, I am trying to produce a quality clip that will reach the masses on a very meek budget of $6,000.00.  The video is scheduled to shoot on January 9, 2016 in LA.  I had the great pleasure of meeting the very talented film marker Matthew Mishory while living in Tel Aviv and very blessed that he took a liking to my music project and offered to work with me on a music video.  But in order to get this done I need the help of all of you.  </p>
<p>As a unique perk I am offering the following:</p>
<ul> <li>donations $50.00 or over will receive an autographed copy of Somewhere Along The Way with extra download cards to give to family or friends</li> <li>donations $500.00 or over will receive one of my famous Sweet Baby desserts (limited to the Ottawa and Gatineau area)</li>

The genre ranges from ragtime to present day jazz stylings with its heavy use of improvisation, polyrhythms, syncopation, swing note, blue notes, brass, European harmony and American popular music, and continues to develop a sound and feel all of its own.</div><div>Antoine’s distinctive vocal style is perfectly complemented by a very talented group of musicians: double bassist Guy Levi, Saxophone player Kobi Salomon, drummer Roi Oliel and jazz pianist Asaf Finkelstein.

<p>Fusiorama is a project created by Lucho Benzaquen

to do everything in our power to make Peruvian music
to be heard around the world.</p>
<p>That is why we need your support to achieve our
goals; that is to say, shooting our first music video and the
project’s official launching live.</p>
<p><b>WHAT
DO WE NEED AND WHAT DO YOU GET IN RETURN?</b></p>
<p>We are fortunate in having very talented people
who want to contribute in taking our music much further for
it to be heard around the world. One of them is Alberto
Fernández, leading AV producer, who has offered to direct
the music video for free. Consequently, we only need to cover
the production’s costs.</p>
<p>We need the money for two specific activities:</p>
<p><b><u>Music

<p>- Rental facility for the music video’s
shooting.</p>
<p>- Rental of cameras, lights, and generator.</p>
<p>- Transportation fees.</p>

<p>- Set design.</p>
<p><b><u>Album’s launching live:</u></b></p>
<p>- Equipment rental.</p>
<p>- Technical staff’s fees.</p>
<p>- Flyers and posters’ design and printing.</p>
<p>We offer you the band’s musical material including:

<p><b>ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES</b></p>
<p>If we do not achieve our goal, we will use the funds
raised to involve the media in the live concert so as to
raise the lacking funds. If we succeed, we will be able to

<div>I love creating music. I've been singing for most of my life, and almost a year ago realized my intense passion for songwriting. I play several different instruments and my own kind of indie music, drawing influences from an eclectic set of musicians including Zee Avi, Regina Spektor, Joni Mitchell, and Norah Jones, among many others. </div>

As a kid, I used music as a tool; it helped me focus and navigate my thoughts &amp; feelings. I started writing songs when I was nine. I learned how to write by listening to artists I looked up to, I wasn't just a listener... they were my teachers.  I would take a song break down the lyrics, study the structure and this is how I learned how to write.<br/>Music has gotten me through some of the hardest times in my life and helped me overcome great challenges. When I felt lost and alone and had no one to turn to, music was there for me. A big reason of why I became a singer/songwriter is to try and help others with my music by sharing my experiences and hopefully help others the way music helped me.<br/><br/>Music is power. And as a musician, I want to empower my fans to follow their dreams and know they can make a change. Anything is possible! It is my goal to make music that people can connect to.

<p>Hey everybody!</p>
<p>My name is Alexis Taylor and I'm a singer/songwriter from Canada.  Growing up in the small town of Huntsville, Ontario, I spent most of my childhood and teenage years both singing and songwriting. Two years ago when I decided  to move to Nashville, Tennessee to pursue my dream of becoming a musician, I didn't know anybody.  I had to overcome the fear of moving to a city a thousand miles from my friends and family, with hopes of one day making it big in the music industry.</p>
<p>Since I've moved to Nashville, I've been writing more than ever and am finally ready to record my first album!  <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I'm excited to be recording my album with record producer and engineer, Matt Gordon.  Like myself, Matt is also a Canadian who moved to Nashville to pursue his dreams in music, and now owns and operates 1092 Studios. Matt is a graduate of the Music Production &amp; Engineering program at Berklee College of Music and is nothing short of extremely talented. </span></p>
<p>However, without a major label funding me, I won't be able to make this record without your help.  My project cost itself will be roughly $10,000.00 USD. My goal amount not only includes the cost to record, mix, and master the album but also distribute the album, promote it and market it. I am determined to make this the best album I possibly can and promise not to let you down. </p>
<p>I cannot tell you how much your support and donations mean to me - I truly appreciate it and sincerely am so grateful. Any size donation helps and means the world to me, and I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for allowing me to continue to do what I have always dreamed of doing. </p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Alexis Taylor</p>

Now, on June 18, we're presenting our NINTH Festival and need some help from you to help make it another wonderfully eclectic feast for musical omnivores. 
Where does the money go?
 Our single biggest expense is paying our incredible musicians—they are also the most rewarding checks we write all year. 

We've already raised about 60% of funds for the Festival, but really need that other 40% to get these folks what they deserve. 
We pride ourselves on supporting live music, and over 95% of the 150+ sets (that's almost 1,000 musicians) we have presented hail from the Bay Area. Supporting artists financially is as important as providing creative outlets, and we've spent nearly 10 years doing both.
