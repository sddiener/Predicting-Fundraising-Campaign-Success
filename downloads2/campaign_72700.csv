<p></p></div>","CareerCortex: Join the Movement to Easier EmploymentIn our uber efficient society, HR seems to be the last business component to catch up. We can have an international meeting with the click of a button, we can mass message potential clients, and we can have live streaming video almost anywhere we need it, but when it comes to the hiring process, the answer is not so simple. The hiring process includes posting job criteria with daunting details to be proactive and then reviewing potential candidates, interviewing (sometimes up to five times) then of course hiring and hoping for the best. And when all is said and done many employee positions have a very high turn around.                     Overview
Our popular culture also reinforces the idea that the hiring process is dated, daunting and extensive. We're out to change that fallacious idea one digital recruiting program at a time! The age of modern recruitment has arrived and CareerCortex is at the heart of this fast-paced, interactive and digital era. Our aim is to empower and invigorate recruitment practices like never thought possible. Help us establish our process for HR departments everywhere. A small donation to this project gets you access to our website and can change your ideas about what you can accomplish for the rest of your life through hiring accomplished and trustworthy employees. Empower us to break the hiring stereotype with a donation to this project today! The average cost of a bad hiring decision can equal 30% of the individual’s first-year potential earnings. (From the US Department of Labor and Statistics) – This fact prompted us to dig deeper into a solution. This is where we started to envision CareerCortex and all the possible benefits:

--We know resume writing is challenging so we want to aid in applicant’s ability to extenuate their unique personality and ability to contribute to their prospective employer.


 -- We understand what it takes to hire great talent and we know that nothing can replace a face-to-face conversation, but we also believe that modern technology has radically changed the way a first-time meeting should happen. That’s why we want to create virtual interviewing and resume solutions that save time and money but still maintain a personal, authentic experience.


--We also encourage users to take the initiative and post their background check info along with their resume to take pride in showing that they have nothing to hide. This gives them a chance to prove their education or employment history.


--We want to encourage applicants to make a video of their resume to add their personality to their page and application.


We feel these features make us incredibly qualified to succeed. This paired with attention to detail, and quality service will make us the leader in the industry.

</div><p>Yeboah International Farms is 607-acre farm that grows mangoes, cashews, and maize. We are prepared to put 4,000 Ghanaians to work growing and harvesting the crops that grow right here: the crops that the world wants. We believe this is the most sustainable way to bring long-term employment to Ghanians, and help our country as a whole.</p><p>Mangoes are one our biggest exports thus we have developed 20/607 acres and we simply can’t produce enough to keep up with demand. It’s got to the point where one of our biggest processing and production manufacturers is having to airlift the fruit in from Brazil, Mali and South Africa at a vast cost just to keep going and that is where we want to change the game.</p><p>Yeboah International Farms owns more than 607 acres of prime farm land in a country that has several weather ecosystems. This allows us to extend our growing season beyond normal, thus increasing our output. We have 100 acres earmarked for cashew nuts, 200 acres earmarked for mangoe and we also plan to plant at least 6000 bags of maize every single year. We already have the updated technology to help us achieve this.</p><p><b>What is the demand for mangoes and cashews?</b> </p><p>Mango-growing nations exported over five times as much mangoes in 2010 as they did in 2001. This owes to a growing global population, and increased demand from nations where the mango cannot be grown, such as the United States and European countries. As for cashews, Nigeria and Côte d’Ivoire are among the top five producers of the nut worldwide. These countries are Ghana’s neighbors. The only thing keeping Ghana from joining these countries is viable farmland, which is exactly what this campaign seeks to develop.</p><p><b>  How has Yeboah secured its farmland?</b></p><p>The equipment secured by this campaign will be available for use by small producers of mangoes, cashews, and maize. This allows us to cover more climatically diverse territory, and put more money back into the hands of these farmers. As it stands now, we have over 607 acres of prime farmland slated for this project. </p><p><b>Who will be served by this campaign</b>?</p><p>Over 4 million people in Ghana’s rural population live below the poverty line – some 39% of the rural population, and 28% of the nation. Life is hard for these people. Many have been making a living by processing fruit that has been airlifted in from other countries. These circumstances have existed because not enough local farmland has been developed for agriculture – until now. </p><p><b>What will be the effects of growing more mangoes here in Ghana?</b></p><p>Ghana is essentially paying to stay in business as a mango and cashew processor. To meet orders from our buyers, we make up the difference by airlifting in fruits from Mali, South Africa, and Brazil. Though this practice helps us keep our clients, it’s not a sustainable long-term solution. Getting Ghana to produce more of the food it processes benefits the farmers, the producers, and the national economy. Employing local growers and processors means bringing Ghana’s rural population out of poverty – something we are prepared to do on a large scale.</p><p><b>Why crowd funding?</b></p><p>Though we think our idea has merit, resources from organizations which give large grants are limited, especially at the local and national level. Getting small contributors to work together is the business model for our farm operation, and, we believe, will serve us well at this stage too.</p><p><b>What makes Yeboah different from other farms?</b></p><p>We have superior maize production technology that can allow local producers to increase their output. We cover more ground with our land holdings, so we can custom-build a season’s crops according to what grows best where. We are a culturally-aware and technologically-advanced company with the good of the country in mind, and know what can be done when we put our resources together.</p><p>We are seeking your help to set up; to help the people of Ghana survive poverty and bring the world the best fruits and nuts from a country that grows the best but cannot keep up with demand. We need to raise $150,000 and this will be used to purchase:   <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">excavators, planters, harvesters, and seeds.</span></p><p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Breakdown of Cost</b><br/></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">11,000 for four head Tatu planter from Brazil.</span><br/></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">

We are prepared to put 4,000 Ghanaians to work growing and harvesting the crops that grow right here: the crops that the world wants. We believe this is the most sustainable way to bring long-term employment to Ghanians, and help our country as a whole.Mangoes are one our biggest exports thus we have developed 20/607 acres and we simply can’t produce enough to keep up with demand. It’s got to the point where one of our biggest processing and production manufacturers is having to airlift the fruit in from Brazil, Mali and South Africa at a vast cost just to keep going and that is where we want to change the game.Yeboah International Farms owns more than 607 acres of prime farm land in a country that has several weather ecosystems. This allows us to extend our growing season beyond normal, thus increasing our output. We have 100 acres earmarked for cashew nuts, 200 acres earmarked for mangoe and we also plan to plant at least 6000 bags of maize every single year. We already have the updated technology to help us achieve this.What is the demand for mangoes and cashews? Mango-growing nations exported over five times as much mangoes in 2010 as they did in 2001. This owes to a growing global population, and increased demand from nations where the mango cannot be grown, such as the United States and European countries. As for cashews, Nigeria and Côte d’Ivoire are among the top five producers of the nut worldwide. These countries are Ghana’s neighbors. The only thing keeping Ghana from joining these countries is viable farmland, which is exactly what this campaign seeks to develop.  How has Yeboah secured its farmland?The equipment secured by this campaign will be available for use by small producers of mangoes, cashews, and maize. This allows us to cover more climatically diverse territory, and put more money back into the hands of these farmers. As it stands now, we have over 607 acres of prime farmland slated for this project. Who will be served by this campaign?Over 4 million people in Ghana’s rural population live below the poverty line – some 39% of the rural population, and 28% of the nation. Life is hard for these people. Many have been making a living by processing fruit that has been airlifted in from other countries. These circumstances have existed because not enough local farmland has been developed for agriculture – until now. What will be the effects of growing more mangoes here in Ghana?Ghana is essentially paying to stay in business as a mango and cashew processor. To meet orders from our buyers, we make up the difference by airlifting in fruits from Mali, South Africa, and Brazil. Though this practice helps us keep our clients, it’s not a sustainable long-term solution. Getting Ghana to produce more of the food it processes benefits the farmers, the producers, and the national economy. Employing local growers and processors means bringing Ghana’s rural population out of poverty – something we are prepared to do on a large scale.Why crowd funding?Though we think our idea has merit, resources from organizations which give large grants are limited, especially at the local and national level. Getting small contributors to work together is the business model for our farm operation, and, we believe, will serve us well at this stage too.What makes Yeboah different from other farms?We have superior maize production technology that can allow local producers to increase their output. We cover more ground with our land holdings, so we can custom-build a season’s crops according to what grows best where. We are a culturally-aware and technologically-advanced company with the good of the country in mind, and know what can be done when we put our resources together.We are seeking your help to set up; to help the people of Ghana survive poverty and bring the world the best fruits and nuts from a country that grows the best but cannot keep up with demand. We need to raise $150,000 and this will be used to purchase:   excavators, planters, harvesters, and seeds.Breakdown of Cost11,000 for four head Tatu planter from Brazil.
13,000 mini corn harvester from China
11,000 corn shelled meant to shell corn from the cob
15,000 for mango and cashew nut seedlings sold at $1.00 per
seedling. 
5k cashew nut seedlings sold will be planted on a 100 acres in 2
years 
10k mango seedlings will be planted on a 200 acre land within 2

$100,000 earmarked for caterpillar excavator 320DL model. Since
Ghana has a 
tropical climate the land for farming is mostly forrest with a lot
of big trees, which 
need to be uprooted to prepare the land for planting. That
is the most challenging 
aspect of the farming project. 
     The excavator will be offered to small holder farmers in the
community to expand 
the acres of land they usually cultivated averaging from 5
acres to about 20 acres or
 more.  Yeboah International Farm is in with 300
small holder farmers who will

<p><span>MIC PGH stands for Music Industry Connected, Pittsburgh -- we act as a “startup incubator” for local musicians to turn their hobbies into careers through research, consulting, and connecting them with the resources they otherwise wouldn’t have access to.</span></p>
<br/><p>We develop the IMBM, the “Indie Music Business Model” in real-time by constantly doing music projects so our advice is never outdated.</p>
<br/><p>We’re not a label, we don’t own musicians, we educate them on how to make money off of their music, and find success in Pittsburgh so they don’t have to move away, because now this is all possible right here in this technology-driven music era.</p>
<br/><p>We’re a totally new concept to the music industry – during our public debut these past few weeks, we’ve taken the chance to break down some of the barriers and misconceptions about music careers. We’ve been all around town and online talking to people, meeting people, and sponsoring events -- and the reaction has been overwhelmingly positive.</p>
<br/><h3>The money we raise here will allow us to do the following things:</h3>
<br/><ol>
<li><p><b>Next IMBM Project: Great Oaks.</b> We will launch our next Indie Music Business Model project (Great Oaks) so we can further our research and staff a team of local freelancers at living wage salaries.</p></li>
<li><p><b>More Relationships/Resources.</b> We will continue to develop and cement the relationships with more resources our musicians need (like publishers and distributors) through that Great Oaks Project.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Book. </b>More details coming soon. (Secret status!)</p></li>
</ol>
<br/><p>Along the way you’ll get more Sanctuary video/blogs as behind-the-scenes explanations of everything the MIC team is doing. Transparency is important to us. (Visit <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/mic-pgh-the-1st-startup-incubator-for-musicians/www.MICPGH.com/Sanctuary"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.MICPGH.com/Sanctuary</a>)</p>
<br/><p>We’re an unconventional startup in a tech startup city, and so finding investors has been incredibly hard. I’ve been actively seeking them and if you’re out there, please talk to me!</p>
<br/><p>No one else is doing what MIC PGH is doing:  we don’t want to own musicians, we are here to educate them, at a low cost to them.  And we will not give up on this mission. MIC is going to help so many musicians not give up or move away from their hometowns and families.</p>
<br/><br/><p>And to the awesome MIC Lovers who already pitched in (and those of you that are about to!): thank you.</p>
<br/><p>I’m Emily Plazek, the founder of MIC Pittsburgh. Much love, and peace.</p>
<br/><br/><p>Special Thanks to...</p>

We're featuring it
because we believe in their mission to shift perception of the value of local
music (which is currently undervalued!) Here's the idea:</p>
<p>Think about your favorite local brew. It's
unique, delicious, and doesn't have that
""tastes-like-everything-else"" manufactured quality. It's probably a
little more expensive, too, isn't it? Well good. It should be!</p>
<p>It's a unique product that is unbridled and
the brewery that makes it isn't lorded over by some larger overbearing entity
telling it what to do in order to make it <b><i>sound</i></b>... I
mean, ""taste"" like everything else. </p>
<p>""<i>So, you mean we can get a quality,
unique product when it's made locally!?""  </i>Why yes, that's exactly
what we mean. </p>
<p>That's exactly why local music should be
treated the way we treat local brews. It's unbridled, bold, different, and free
to be a breath of fresh air in an industry where a few big names run the
market. </p>
<p>#CraftMusic encourages Pittsburgh to look at
local music the way it looks at local craft beer – <b>bold, unique, and
uninhibited</b>. </p>

THE MIC PGH PROJECT
                                         



MIC PGH stands for Music Industry Connected, Pittsburgh -- we act as a “startup incubator” for local musicians to turn their hobbies into careers through research, consulting, and connecting them with the resources they otherwise wouldn’t have access to.
We develop the IMBM, the “Indie Music Business Model” in real-time by constantly doing music projects so our advice is never outdated.
We’re not a label, we don’t own musicians, we educate them on how to make money off of their music, and find success in Pittsburgh so they don’t have to move away, because now this is all possible right here in this technology-driven music era.
We’re a totally new concept to the music industry – during our public debut these past few weeks, we’ve taken the chance to break down some of the barriers and misconceptions about music careers. We’ve been all around town and online talking to people, meeting people, and sponsoring events -- and the reaction has been overwhelmingly positive.
The money we raise here will allow us to do the following things:

Next IMBM Project: Great Oaks. We will launch our next Indie Music Business Model project (Great Oaks) so we can further our research and staff a team of local freelancers at living wage salaries.
More Relationships/Resources. We will continue to develop and cement the relationships with more resources our musicians need (like publishers and distributors) through that Great Oaks Project.
Book. More details coming soon. (Secret status!)

Along the way you’ll get more Sanctuary video/blogs as behind-the-scenes explanations of everything the MIC team is doing. Transparency is important to us. (Visit www.MICPGH.com/Sanctuary)
We’re an unconventional startup in a tech startup city, and so finding investors has been incredibly hard. I’ve been actively seeking them and if you’re out there, please talk to me!
No one else is doing what MIC PGH is doing:  we don’t want to own musicians, we are here to educate them, at a low cost to them.  And we will not give up on this mission. MIC is going to help so many musicians not give up or move away from their hometowns and families.
And to the awesome MIC Lovers who already pitched in (and those of you that are about to!): thank you.
I’m Emily Plazek, the founder of MIC Pittsburgh. Much love, and peace.
Special Thanks to...
Interns Eric Praniewicz, Joe Pileggi and Lucia Vento; editor Eric Schwartz - and, of course, the whole MIC Team of interns & freelancers, 
Crystal Sounds Management & the #CraftMusic Campaign,
And our long-time mentor, Kellee Maize -- the video featured her song ""Anyway (feat. J. Glaze)"".

This is how we planned to allocate the funds raised here for our original 5 deliverables -- but now any money raised will be reconfigured into our strategy pivot:














...and wait, what are the #CRAFTMUSIC Mystery Bags?



#CraftMusic is a campaign run by another
creative company in Pittsburgh: Crystal Sounds Management (CSM). We're featuring it
because we believe in their mission to shift perception of the value of local
music (which is currently undervalued!) Here's the idea:
Think about your favorite local brew. It's
unique, delicious, and doesn't have that
""tastes-like-everything-else"" manufactured quality. It's probably a
little more expensive, too, isn't it? Well good. It should be!
It's a unique product that is unbridled and
the brewery that makes it isn't lorded over by some larger overbearing entity
telling it what to do in order to make it sound... I
mean, ""taste"" like everything else. 
""So, you mean we can get a quality,
unique product when it's made locally!?""  Why yes, that's exactly
what we mean. 
That's exactly why local music should be
treated the way we treat local brews. It's unbridled, bold, different, and free
to be a breath of fresh air in an industry where a few big names run the
market. 
#CraftMusic encourages Pittsburgh to look at
local music the way it looks at local craft beer – bold, unique, and
uninhibited. 


So, our main prizes are #CraftMusic
“Mystery Bags"". 

These bags feature local music products, and
craft brewery coupons/prizes for music listeners and musicians alike – so MIC
PGH can support the Crystal Sounds Management vision for #CraftMusic.




OTHER
WAYS YOU CAN HELP
Of course raising our goal amount will help make the MIC
PGH mission come true — but you know what’s also super valuable? Spreading the
word!
Here
are some actions we recommend:


Pick out a cool prize like that “Mystery Bag” and
get pumped for the mailman to deliver it!
Follow & support & meet that local musician!
(They’re probably just as awesome as you are!)
Buy a megaphone & shout “MIC PGH RULES” from atop Steel Tower!
Tell the guy standing next to you on the elevator!
Follow us on social media! 

Sign up for the email list! 


If you see any of the MIC team, ask for a hug. (We’re incredibly grateful for every little bit you help us out.)


And most importantly: Support your local musicians by going to their shows, buying their CDs and merch, listening to their music, and recommending them to your friends!

PGH is a most
livable city, a sports nation, a foodie paradise, a tech city, an
education city, and we are also a music city with a ton of talent – here’s our
chance to break the norm of letting our musicians move away or give up.To the
MIC PGH Mission to help musicians.To
Pittsburgh’s music industry hitting its mini-hub potential through the
successes of our own musicians.To
You.THANK
YOU!!!

<p>If by chance the goal is not met, that's OK! All donation will be an investment towards this and future Cafes! I hope to be able to use pre-sale RSVP tickets and day-of sales to reimburse the extra expenses like food and drink supplies.

<p>The original goal was to be able to lease the space next to Challenges Games &amp; Comics at North Dekalb Mall and to run a daily cafe with the Maid theme. Rent, time, fees, and market research still make that dream a little ways off--but still burning! I would like at least a year to understand the needs of a fully-functional coffee shop before committing to a permanent location.</p>
<p>What's great about this location is that it's not only next to a busy comic book and gaming store, it's near the mall's movie theater, the food court, and the mall is a shuttle stop for Emory University students. Location, location, location!</p>
<p>I have help from those close to me and I'm open to recommendations from those who have industry experience I could use! I've seen the idea blossom in other parts of America and it gives me so much hope, but any dream takes getting dirty to make it real! I don't expect things to go smoothly and I'm scared of my own procrastination and possibly money loss, but I'm too deep in this idea to back out--and the ideas I have for these desserts MUST come to life!</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If donating just isn't for you, we would still love to see you at the event on March 5 and 6! Check our Facebook page for updates and ticket pre-sales!</p>
<p>If you are a coffee shop owner, coffee barista, or food service professional, your knowledge is as beneficial as your donation, and both are welcome during this campaign!</p>

<p>*~Renee C. {AKA Maid Michiko}</p>
</div></div>","Welcome, Sir! Ma'am!

(Youkoso, Goshujinsama! Ojosama!)

My name is Renee (you may also know me as Little Wren or NOW Maid Michiko)  and I am NOT Japanese, but I do enjoy many aspects of Japanese culture, like anime, manga, and cosplay. So much so that I planned my first Maid Cafe event in December of 2015 and would like to continue these adorable, interactive, and delicious events throughout the year! 

This next chapter of what is now Peachy Maid Cafe has new ideas for upgraded desserts and popular drink options, plus a temporary new space! The theme is ""Cookie Fantasy,"" occurring March 5 and 6 at the Atlanta Sci-Fi & Fantasy Expo, and will feature a weekend of cookie dough treats, coffee, tea and an overload of sweetness like you don't often see!
Planning is underway and will be documented on the Peachy Maid Facebook and Instagram Pages!

What We Need & What You Get I'm asking for up to $1200 to manage the following: 



Coffeemaker and grinder (Hamilton Beach brand ~$115) OR

Commercial coffee machine (Bunn brand ~$500)
Portable cooler (Rubbermaid or Coleman ~$50-100)

Milk Frother/Heater (Epica brand ~$20)


Vinyl wall stickers (~$60)

Other wall and table decoration (~$50)

Cups, dessert plates, serving and eating utensils (like toothpicks, straws, and long spoons) (~$150)


Entertainment for guests like simple board games, manga, comics, and books (~$50 or may be used or donated)


Food and drink ingredients for initial testing (Baking supplies, storage, baked goods, candy, etc) (~$60)

Cleaning services (~$75)
Printer paper and ink for photos (~$40)
Maid costumes and accessories for sizing and styling (~$75)
Miscellaneous equipment (milkshake blender, cocktail shaker)
Miscellaneous licensing and documentation


 

The best part of the food testing stage is that it allows us to post photos of our dessert progress (and possible epic fails), and hopefully get you excited for Cookie Fantasy treats!

If by chance the goal is not met, that's OK! All donation will be an investment towards this and future Cafes! I hope to be able to use pre-sale RSVP tickets and day-of sales to reimburse the extra expenses like food and drink supplies. A worse case scenario is that we have a limited amount of the really pretty desserts to serve, but the experience will still be available for anyone wanting to visit the Cafe. 
The Impact
 

The very first event was the Hot Cocoa Maid Cafe and featured 6 Maids, 1 Butler, the back room of a game store, and a LOT of cocoa mix!  I invested my own money towards food, drinks, and equipment, and was thankful to have the owner of Challenges Games & Comics donate space and a printer (for the adorable cheki pictures). 

Though a bit hectic, customers told us they had a great time and would be willing to see a Maid Cafe as a regular occurrence in the area. I loved completing the first event and hearing the feedback, and it's fueled my fire to make the next event exponentially better!
While I may be far from the level of professionalism of Akihabara Maid Cafes, my overall goal has always been to give fellow fans in the community a place to enjoy a little piece of Japanese culture with local comforts and originality. Your contribution will boost my vision to turn an abandoned mall space into a functional cafe with blossoming decor, hand-crafted dessert and drink options, and interactive fun. The equipment and knowledge I can procure for this event will help ease the pressure off future Maid Cafes.
Risks & Challenges

 I have a 9 to 5 day job. It's convenient because I am always in front of a computer and able to constantly research and plan, but the real planning can't happen on the internet. From today on I'll be touring the aisles of Asian markets, visiting pastry shops, destroying my kitchen, learning to dance and sing in Japanese, auditioning new Maids, cleaning and decorating this new temporary event space! PHEW!


The original goal was to be able to lease the space next to Challenges Games & Comics at North Dekalb Mall and to run a daily cafe with the Maid theme. Rent, time, fees, and market research still make that dream a little ways off--but still burning! I would like at least a year to understand the needs of a fully-functional coffee shop before committing to a permanent location.
What's great about this location is that it's not only next to a busy comic book and gaming store, it's near the mall's movie theater, the food court, and the mall is a shuttle stop for Emory University students. Location, location, location!
I have help from those close to me and I'm open to recommendations from those who have industry experience I could use! I've seen the idea blossom in other parts of America and it gives me so much hope, but any dream takes getting dirty to make it real! I don't expect things to go smoothly and I'm scared of my own procrastination and possibly money loss, but I'm too deep in this idea to back out--and the ideas I have for these desserts MUST come to life!
    Other Ways You Can Help If donating just isn't for you, we would still love to see you at the event on March 5 and 6! Check our Facebook page for updates and ticket pre-sales!
If you are a coffee shop owner, coffee barista, or food service professional, your knowledge is as beneficial as your donation, and both are welcome during this campaign!


If you are a fan of Japanese culture and media, American small businesses and entrepreneurship, or new possibilities to have your cookie fantasies unleashed, help spread the word anyway you can! Please follow Peachy Maid Cafe on Facebook and Instagram to get first peeks are all progress! Thank you for reading and I am SO EXCITED for future of Peachy Maid Cafe! 
Thank You Very Much! 
Arigatou gozaimashita!

</h3>
<p>From 1847 to 1996 Rhode Island had an amusement park to call its own… Rocky Point Park was a wonderful place that still holds a special place in the hearts and minds of the public here in New England. For more than 18 years that park has been gone, leaving the public of Rhode Island with nothing to do for summertime recreation.</p>
<p>In 2010 the people of Rhode Island voted to save the land at Rocky Point for future generations – unfortunately the cold truth was that this Vote was about saving the land, NOT about bringing the amusement park back. </p>
<p>Ultimately the park has become an “open space coastal park” with no attractions. It will never truly take the place of immersive and involved recreation that New Englanders desire.</p>
<p><strong>NOW</strong> is the time for the people to speak up, to take action to build something we as a State can enjoy in this generation and for future generations to come. Our program is in place, the business plan is sound, now we need <strong>YOUR SUPPORT</strong> to make it a reality.</p>

<p>As the saying goes “when one door closes another one opens”. We are happy to share that the very forward thinking Mayor of Woonsocket opened that door!</p>
<p>Mayor Lisa Baldelli-Hunt made us aware of locations in her city that supply us everything we need to develop a successful water park.</p>
<p>Not only are the sites excellent, access is exceptional. The sites are easily reached from both RI and MA by I-95, I-295, Rt.146 &amp; Rt.146A plus I-495 and Rt.99 as well as from I-195 via I-95. In Woonsocket we have finally found all the requirements in one place and are working with the administration.</p>

<h3><strong>How many attractions?</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p>The proposed water park will feature 12 slides including a children’s interactive area. The slides will all be of superior height and complexity compared to its competitors. The park will also include a 20,000 sq.ft. wave pool and a lazy river of at least 900′ x 16′ wide. Also featured at the park will be a 50′ diameter Children’s spray pad and a 60′ diameter Children’s interactive play unit with water cannons, slides, dump bucket and more…</p>

<p><br/></p>
<h3>The Local Impact</h3>This WaterPark will attract about 100,000 visitors or more from MA into RI, who would not have any other reason to venture into RI. The RI economy will be stimulated by this new visitorship spending from MA., at local area RI businesses. Jobs will be created to build the park and jobs created to operate the park. Yes, we understand that these may not be year round jobs yet, but the long term plan is to make the water park a year round destination.<br/><p></p>

<h3>So, what's Llama Lloyd?</h3>
<p>March 1st 2015 I opened up Llama Lloyd, my little culture cafe that encourages people to bike here in Gothenburg, Sweden. Right now the building the cafe is being renovated so there's scaffolding around and will be so until the middle of the summer. For this reason I kept the cafe closed during the winter months but will re-open again this spring. I'm still paying rent so I need to kickstart the cafe again with a little cash from you guys! Together with local designer <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/kurtlightnermakesthings/?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kurt Lightner</a> we've designed a new limited edition tote bag! You can either buy a tote bag to have me continue biking or a tote bag to have me turn back home and open up the cafe already! There's also ten cups of coffee cards <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/drawnbynina/?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Drawn by Nina</a> – why not buy one for a friend? </p>

<br/><h3>You wanna bike too? Rent the bike!</h3>
<p>When I get back back to Gothenburg you will be able to rent a foldable Brompton bicycle, the same kind I'm using on this trip. Maybe you're commuting by car into Gothenburg and want to try how it would be to bike to the train, fold up the bike, take the train and then continue by bicycle? My main goal with the cafe is to get more people on bikes – that's why everybody who arrives on a bike get 10% off food and drinks! So this campaign is for the people that live a little further away from their work places in Gothenburg and get them to bike a bit of their way to work! Would you like to rent the bike when I'm back? Simply book a rental. The rental period would be Tue-Thu, Thu-Sat or Sat-Tue so you will be able to go back and forth to work on a weekday. We'll set up a schedule when the campaign is over and I'm back home.</p>
<h3>The bicycle is the simple solution to a lot of complex problems. </h3>
<p>So why do I want more people to bike? I feel that the bicycle is the answer to so many of today's problems and on top of that biking is a sense of total freedom, you can go anywhere by bike! If you commute by bike you spend the same (or often less) time of your day getting to work. You get a little exercise and you save money since there's no congestion charges on the bike lanes and your vehicle runs on fat, not oil! And another thousand reasons!</p>

The good news is, through Timu it no longer takes years to build trust.  Our users can sign-up in seconds, and start winning trust immediately.  By getting involved, they will meet a community of people with localised job opportunities, find educational programs that are close by, connect with brain boxes who have the solutions to their most pressing challenges, and even identify trustworthy do-gooders to help them through a crisis.

Let’s face it, we all need someone
to trust and to be trusted in return, don’t we? Learning to trust used to be one of life's most difficult
tasks - til Timu. Now you can meet your individual or organisational needs, prove
your trust-worthiness, get people to vouch for you, and discover interesting
ways to build relationships that open more opportunities for you.







We believe that Timu can help solve the massive education and unemployment challenges we are facing as a nation, so please
support our Indiegogo campaign and help us to finish building our online
platform. Together, we can help thousands of people to help
themselves.  You can make a real,
tangible difference by bringing Timu into the world.  We have the vision, conviction, skills and
determination to make Timu a resounding success but we lack the financial

commissioned the first ship, the ""Aberdeen"" to service the growing

<p><b>The
Ship</b></p>
<p>Today the Fintry Queen lies idle,
tethered to large pilings in Sutherland Bay, waiting for the next chapter in
her life story. For more than 60 years, she has been a part of Kelowna's
downtown waterfront, carrying an average of more than 28,000 passengers each
summer. </p>
<p>Originally named the ""M.V.
Lequime"", the Fintry Queen was built in Vancouver in 1948 and shipped by
rail in sections to Kelowna, where she became one of three car and passenger
ferries crossing Okanagan Lake. </p>
<p>In the the 1960’s, the Lequime was
transformed into the ""Fintry Queen"" to transport travelers and
tourists to the new development at Fintry Estates.  The ship was built as
a paddlewheeler to reflect the sternwheeler tradition on Okanagan Lake.</p>
<p>The first version of the Fintry
Queen was all open deck. Passengers were issued with raincoats for the first
few years. Fortunately, times have changed and today the ship can carry up to
325 passengers in comfort year-round. The enclosed Main Deck is both heated and
air conditioned, featuring a commercial galley, an indoor forward lounge that
seats 80 and a rear main dining room with a bar and dance floor for another 120
seated guests. On the Upper Deck, there is a covered outdoor area, open sun
deck, barbeque, snack bar and kids fun room. The ship formerly held a food
liquor license for 280 patrons and a pub license for 225 passengers, where
minors were permitted.  Two fuel efficient turbo diesel engines power the
vessel at an average cruising speed of 6-8 knots. Initially designed as an
all-season car ferry with an extra thick hull for breaking through the ice, the
Fintry Queen's unique hull and bow shape, enables her to get close to shore where
she can utilize her bow boarding ramp to safely load and unload passengers
where there are no docking facilities.</p>
<p>When last operated in 2008, the ship was in excellent mechanical
condition.  An estimated $800,000 had
been spent in the immediate years prior to completely refit the mechanical
systems.  Engines were rebuilt, new
shafts and propellers added, fire control systems, kitchen equipment, all the
electrical wiring panels and breakers were replaced.  What is required is a new coat of paint on
the exterior and renovations to the interior to give her a better theme appeal.</p>
<p>The new moorage site in Penticton will be located at the foot of Main
Street, adjacent to the existing Kiwanis Pier, in the heart of the downtown
core.  Design plans, engineering for
utilities and environmental permits have all been completed.  The dock could be built and the ship readied
for Summer 2017 if this crowd-funding program is successful.</p>
<p>The first phase of the funding will go towards a new coat of paint and
general preparations. A second round of funding would go towards building the
public pier and installing the utilities. Anyone interested in becoming a

<p>In 2009, after working about a year in the 'big city' of Birmingham, AL, I moved back to my hometown of Selma, Alabama and decided to give entrepreneurship a try.</p>
<p>I took a lien against my car, got $7,500, and started the Selma Good Company and the G Mommas' Cookies. For the next few weeks Gammy(Gmomma) taught me everything there was to know about baking the cookies. I was 24 at the time and had no clue what I was doing. </p>
<p>I found an abandoned restaurant with a 400 sq. ft. kitchen in downtown Selma and started baking cookies. I started with 3 stores and grew it to 35 over the next year and half. Things grew so fast I couldn't keep up.  So in late 2011 I was forced to put the business on pause in order to find another way to grow. In 2013 we were finally able to re-launch with a re-vamped brand and also a contract bakery to help with production.</p>
<p>Outsourcing the baking was the key in getting the brand exposure and distribution we needed, but it's now time to bring production HOME...to Selma, Alabama. </p>

<p><b>Selma</b></p>
<p>The business is about more than Cookies. It's about my hometown. Selma is the 'Queen City' of the Black Belt and is one of the richest towns when it comes to hospitality and southern culture. It's still one of the 'jewels' of the deep south, but it has struggled economically for the last 50 years or so and is now located in one of the poorest areas in the country.  </p>
<p>My dream and passion is to see my hometown as well as this area make a comeback and to see all people here prosper economically.</p>
<p>The next 10 years in Selma are the most important time in the life of our city, and although we've struggled economically, we believe there is a Revival starting to bubble up here. </p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>To start, we will hire up to 6 employees and will hire the majority from a program called the *Fatherhood Initiative Program. </p>
<p><i>*The Fatherhood Initiative Program is designed to not only help young fathers become better fathers but also help them find employment. The program exists to help them get going in the right direction. </i></p>
<p>We've already had success partnering with the program by hiring more than 16 guys on a part-time basis. We will hire straight from the program once we get up and going.</p>
<p>Our goal is to ultimately be a piece to the puzzle for bringing economic growth here in Selma. This facility will also give us the ability to contract bake / pack for other 'up-and-coming' brands and in turn driving more positive attention and economic dollars to Selma.</p>

The next 10 years in Selma are the most important time in the life of our city, and although we've struggled economically, we believe there is a Revival starting to bubble up here. 
The Impact
To start, we will hire up to 6 employees and will hire the majority from a program called the *Fatherhood Initiative Program. 
*The Fatherhood Initiative Program is designed to not only help young fathers become better fathers but also help them find employment. The program exists to help them get going in the right direction. 
We've already had success partnering with the program by hiring more than 16 guys on a part-time basis. We will hire straight from the program once we get up and going.
Our goal is to ultimately be a piece to the puzzle for bringing economic growth here in Selma. This facility will also give us the ability to contract bake / pack for other 'up-and-coming' brands and in turn driving more positive attention and economic dollars to Selma.

Capital Needed:

My goal is: $50,000+ 

In order to put the bakery in Selma it will take purchasing equipment, inventory, and renovating the building. I'm selling cookies and putting on a launch party to help fund the Building Renovations ($50,000+)

Perks are explained Below:

 
4 Bags







 
Launch Party


When we get ready we will have party to officially launch the bakery. Live Music, Cold Beverages, and other Selma made products.

<p>Hi, My name is Ron Menne. I have been working on Barf Buddy for a number of years now, as of this date I have sold approximately 15 to 20,000 Barf Buddy buckets. Barf Buddy is a novelty item with a purpose. For kids Being sick is no fun, throwing up on yourself is less fun. Barf Buddy provides a piece of mind for the child as well as the parent. There is nothing worse  while traveling 70 mph down the expressway with your family than to hear ""I don't feel well"" coming out of the back seat. Lets face it, kids give you about a 3 second notice that they are going to throw up. So as your panicking try desperately to get off the road, risking your live and your families lives, as well as the well being of other drivers, when you finally make it to the side of the road where is semi safe by the time you do your child throws up all over the back seat. And lets face it, that is a smell you are never going to get rid of. Barf Buddy comes with a handle and lid, to contain the mess and the smell.</p>
<p>Barf Buddy is also great for the home as well. Kids are great at throwing up,(mine where) but horrible at making it to the bathroom, they throw up in every room in the house but/except the bathroom. Barf Buddy is there very own personal barf bucket. My kids knew as early as two years old what Barf Buddy was for. I always knew when my kids didn't feel well. All my kids had a Barf buddy in their rooms I knew, when they weren't feel well they simply would go to the closet and get it. Barf Buddy has saved me many times from having to clean up vomit, not to mention the stains in the carpet, cloths, furniture.</p>
<p>To be able to bring Barf Buddy to parents, grand parents, hospitals, schools, or who ever, costs money. Barf Buddy is a simple product but it costs a lot of money to do. I have spent probably over 20,000 dollars. With the moneys I hope to collect, that will go towards a second run of Barf Buddy buckets, which a minimum order is 15,000 at over a dollar a bucket, now that's just buckets. Now the more I order the less  they will cost, but real discounts only happen when I sell over 100,000 buckets. The monies will also go toward supplies like advertising, shipping supplies, Barf Buddy products, t-shirts, sports bottles, ball caps etc. etc. </p>
<p>I believe in Barf Buddy, other parents believe in Barf Buddy, the hospitals that carry Barf Buddy mainly in pediatrics, believe in Barf Buddy.  I hope you believe as well. thank you!</p>
</div></div>","Hi, My name is Ron Menne. I have been working on Barf Buddy for a number of years now, as of this date I have sold approximately 15 to 20,000 Barf Buddy buckets. Barf Buddy is a novelty item with a purpose. For kids Being sick is no fun, throwing up on yourself is less fun. Barf Buddy provides a piece of mind for the child as well as the parent. There is nothing worse  while traveling 70 mph down the expressway with your family than to hear ""I don't feel well"" coming out of the back seat. Lets face it, kids give you about a 3 second notice that they are going to throw up. So as your panicking try desperately to get off the road, risking your live and your families lives, as well as the well being of other drivers, when you finally make it to the side of the road where is semi safe by the time you do your child throws up all over the back seat. And lets face it, that is a smell you are never going to get rid of. Barf Buddy comes with a handle and lid, to contain the mess and the smell.
Barf Buddy is also great for the home as well. Kids are great at throwing up,(mine where) but horrible at making it to the bathroom, they throw up in every room in the house but/except the bathroom.

<h3>The Dream</h3>
<p>Over the years I have dreamed of owning and operating a
specialty boutique. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">However<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">, it wasn't until recently, that I had the </span>opportunity to<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> take some time to
formulate my business ideas into one clear, solid, and cohesive vision.</span></span></p>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span>
<p><b>This is what I envision:</b></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I see <b><i>sásta</i></b> as an intimate and friendly independent retail shop <span>where I can share my skills and
passions with others by creating &amp; displaying original art and helping customers choose
beautiful flowers &amp; thoughtful gifts. I also see <b><i>sásta </i></b>as
a very special boutique in that all merchandise, flowers and packaging will be
purchased with care keeping in mind the impact and sustainability of the environment. This is especially unique with the floral
aspect of <b><i>sásta</i></b>, as unlike most flower shops, I
will be practicing ""<a href=""http://www.sastaflowers.com/green-floristry.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">green floristry</a>"" by not using any chemically based products, flowers that have to be shipped
across the world, or wrapping materials that are not recyclable and/or biodegradable.</span></p>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></span>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span>
<p><b>Synchronicity happens!</b></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p> Not long after my vision became crystal clear, a small vacant retail space
appeared only a short walk from my home in the""up-and-coming"" Pawtuxet Village! Suddenly,
my dreams of wanting to open a business highlighting my creative talents in an
""eco-friendly"" environment are literally ""just around the
bend""! </p>

<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span>
<p>So now, armed with a clear vision, an empty shop waiting to be filled with happy things, and loads of experience as an artist, floral designer and retail manager, I believe it is my time to go forward and open <b><i>sásta</i></b>! And with your help I can reach my goal and share a little happiness and beauty with others!</p>

passions with others by creating & displaying original art and helping customers choose
beautiful flowers & thoughtful gifts. I also see sásta as
a very special boutique in that all merchandise, flowers and packaging will be
purchased with care keeping in mind the impact and sustainability of the environment. This is especially unique with the floral
aspect of sásta, as unlike most flower shops, I
will be practicing ""green floristry"" by not using any chemically based products, flowers that have to be shipped
across the world, or wrapping materials that are not recyclable and/or biodegradable.


Synchronicity happens!

 Not long after my vision became crystal clear, a small vacant retail space
appeared only a short walk from my home in the""up-and-coming"" Pawtuxet Village! Suddenly,
my dreams of wanting to open a business highlighting my creative talents in an
""eco-friendly"" environment are literally ""just around the
bend""! 


So now, armed with a clear vision, an empty shop waiting to be filled with happy things, and loads of experience as an artist, floral designer and retail manager, I believe it is my time to go forward and open sásta! And with your help I can reach my goal and share a little happiness and beauty with others!







The success of sásta !

The success of opening sásta relies on two very important factors:



Crowdfunding by contributors like you, who believe in the vision and success of sásta.


The love and support from my campaign team of family and friends who have been a tremendous help with editing, multi-media & business advising, and initial funding! They are: Ricardo, Emma, Aaron, Pauline and Al.








So what do we need?
       Our goal of $4000 is what we need!



Part of
     the funds will go towards fitting the shop with basic retail necessities such as a point of sale system, fixtures, displays and packaging. 




The
     remaining portion will go towards the initial retail inventory of art,
     flowers, candles, greeting cards, and other tidbits to bring a smile to
     your face!





What's in it for you?
We've got some really nice perks in return for helping us out!










Your contribution matters!

The success of our campaign is so very important, as it will provide a
livelihood where I can blend my talents, passions, and work experiences into an environmentally friendly space, which I believe will bring happiness into the
lives of many, while contributing to the well being of the earth.
So thank you in advance for your contribution! 
I will be forever grateful for your generosity and belief in sásta!

Hafiz was born here and has lived here most of his life; Jana is a biologist who worked in Malaysia and moved to Nipah after falling in love with the nature and with Apis. In 2013, we opened a hostel on a cliff behind the beach to run a homestay in accordance with the exceptional natural beauty of the beach.</p><p>Nipah is a stunningly beautiful beach, backed by a mangrove-lined lagoon and untouched mountainous rainforest. It is a very small, close-knit community  consisting of traditional livelihoods and tourism. Apart from our hostel, there are two other homestays. It is very simple living, and there is no mobile phone coverage or internet connection, and it can only be reached by boat.</p><p>On December 29th, 2014, Nipah was devastated by an unprecedented flash flood which broke through the small river coming down the mountain. In its wake, many structures were destroyed, the mangroves, vital to a healthy ecosystem, were demolished, and most boats washed out to sea. The flood carried huge amounts of debris such as fallen trees, shrubs and rocks which are now littering the area.</p><p>We are trying to raise funds in order to clean up Nipah and support the locals to continue their businesses and maintain their livelihood. At the moment, life has come to a complete standstill, and most locals struggle to find the funds to get back on to their feet and cover their losses.</p><p>We need money to clean up the debris, rebuild the houses, buy boats, replant the mangroves, pay for food, clothes lost in the flood and various everyday essentials. Whatever money we will raise, will be implemented in rebuilding the community - whether it reaches our goal or not or goes above it.</p><p>Please note that we cannot stress enough that we do not try to raise money for our own hostel but to get the local community back on their feet! Most people have lost their livelihood and we try to bring the beach back to its former glory.</p><p>For you to get an idea on what your contribution may be used for, here are some examples:</p><p>10€ will pay to bring in local people from other villages to help clean up the beach and replant the mangroves.</p><p>15€ will buy one set of clothes for one person.</p><p>100€ buys most basic essentials such as gas, pots etc. to be able to cook again.</p><p>500€ pays for a carpenter to rebuild a hut.</p><p>Even if you cannot donate any money, please spread the word. Nipah is so remote that we depend on you to make our case known. The Malaysian government has promised funds to help with the damages the monsoon brought this year in the affected areas of Malaysia, but it could be years until it reaches Nipah if it reaches us at all - by then, it might be too little too late for Nipah.</p></div>","Short Summary We are Jana and Hafiz, a German-Malaysian couple who live in Nipah Beach on Tioman Island in Malaysia.

At the moment, life has come to a complete standstill, and most locals struggle to find the funds to get back on to their feet and cover their losses.We need money to clean up the debris, rebuild the houses, buy boats, replant the mangroves, pay for food, clothes lost in the flood and various everyday essentials. Whatever money we will raise, will be implemented in rebuilding the community - whether it reaches our goal or not or goes above it.Please note that we cannot stress enough that we do not try to raise money for our own hostel but to get the local community back on their feet! Most people have lost their livelihood and we try to bring the beach back to its former glory.For you to get an idea on what your contribution may be used for, here are some examples:10€ will pay to bring in local people from other villages to help clean up the beach and replant the mangroves.15€ will buy one set of clothes for one person.100€ buys most basic essentials such as gas, pots etc. to be able to cook again.500€ pays for a carpenter to rebuild a hut.Even if you cannot donate any money, please spread the word. Nipah is so remote that we depend on you to make our case known. The Malaysian government has promised funds to help with the damages the monsoon brought this year in the affected areas of Malaysia, but it could be years until it reaches Nipah if it reaches us at all - by then, it might be too little too late for Nipah.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<a href=""http://www.bootylandkids.com/Default.asp"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bootyland</a>
opened in<b> 1996</b> in the Chester Building on E. Pine St in Seattle. In
2005 we moved two doors down in the same building to our present
location. Bootyland was conceived by two moms who realized that there
was no neighborhood shop where Capitol Hill parents could  procure
out-of-the-mainstream parenting goods. So Bootyland was born, a kid's
shop featuring vintage, urban, non-commercial clothing, kid
equipment, and a few new handmade items.</p><p>Ellie
Cassidy was working at the shop but she saw the potential for
<b><a href=""http://www.bootylandkids.com/Default.asp"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bootyland</a></b> to be so much more. She envisioned a shop for modern,
city-dwelling families where all of the goods would be ethically made
using sustainable materials, would promote healthy ideas, and would
be hip, cool, and full of style. She took ownership of the store in
2000 and began
cultivating her vision.She created and implemented ethical
guidelines to ensure that Bootyland
would only stock items that are good for people and good for the
planet. Today we are an <a href=""http://awards.redtri.com/2013/kids-clothing-gear-retail-store/?location=seattle"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">award-winning</a> independent retail shop. Noted as one of the <a href=""http://seattle.cbslocal.com/2011/08/03/best-clothing-stores-for-kids-in-seattle/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">best clothing shops</a> in the city as well as the <a href=""Winning%20the%20totally%20Awesome%20reward%20in%202013%20"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">most awesome</a> kids clothing store.

help right now will make this transition smooth. Since we always have
sustainability in mind, we will reuse what we can from our current
location. Of course, we will have needs for new fixtures made from
up-cycled materials and we are hoping for bamboo hangers. Your support
may also allow some new collaborations with local makers and artists,
such as creating a mural in the new space. We are also considering
the viability of earlier opening times so parents can meet and have
discussions or baby &amp; toddler playtimes. We even hope to have
more baby wearing and cloth diapering classes. The more support we
have, the more we can give back. 
</p>
<p>
With
all this new space in the works we are celebrating! We are
celebrating the past 18 plus years in an amazing community. We

</div>","Bootyland
opened in 1996 in the Chester Building on E. Pine St in Seattle. In
2005 we moved two doors down in the same building to our present
location. Bootyland was conceived by two moms who realized that there
was no neighborhood shop where Capitol Hill parents could  procure
out-of-the-mainstream parenting goods. So Bootyland was born, a kid's
shop featuring vintage, urban, non-commercial clothing, kid
equipment, and a few new handmade items.Ellie
Cassidy was working at the shop but she saw the potential for
Bootyland to be so much more. She envisioned a shop for modern,
city-dwelling families where all of the goods would be ethically made
using sustainable materials, would promote healthy ideas, and would
be hip, cool, and full of style. She took ownership of the store in
2000 and began
cultivating her vision.She created and implemented ethical
guidelines to ensure that Bootyland
would only stock items that are good for people and good for the
planet. Today we are an award-winning independent retail shop. Noted as one of the best clothing shops in the city as well as the most awesome kids clothing store. Bootyland provides a thoughtfully curated collection
of items from a wide variety of designers and makers. Thank you AlelaPhotography for these lovely images.Bootyland
is on the look-out for a new space. After over 18 years in the
Chester Building we are looking for a space that will better suit our
customers. Capitol Hill has seen much growth and redevelopment over
the last few years, significantly changing the face of the
neighborhood, and Bootyland must change too. We are asking for your
support and participation. This is what we are about and what we are
asking from you:



	Help
	us continue to do what we love...all ethical all the time



	A
	curated collection of local made, small designers that merge design
	with sustainability.



	Our
	focus on baby clothing, soft goods, and toys that are kind to the
	earth and the humans who make them



	Shout-out for toddler and kids clothing and toys that have style and creativity
	
	



	For
	all the ladies, clothing focused on function and style



We
will continue this tradition and with your support, you will be an
integral part of it! We need $5,000 to $10,000 to complete our
transition into a new home. Your funds will enable us to cover the
cost of moving and setting up an amazing space full of vibrant,
creative goods. Your support will help us put the word out about our
new digs and our passion for design and ethics. Your
help right now will make this transition smooth. Since we always have
sustainability in mind, we will reuse what we can from our current
location. Of course, we will have needs for new fixtures made from
up-cycled materials and we are hoping for bamboo hangers. Your support
may also allow some new collaborations with local makers and artists,
such as creating a mural in the new space. We are also considering
the viability of earlier opening times so parents can meet and have
discussions or baby & toddler playtimes. We even hope to have
more baby wearing and cloth diapering classes. The more support we
have, the more we can give back. 


With
all this new space in the works we are celebrating! We are
celebrating the past 18 plus years in an amazing community. We
celebrate all the connections we made and all of those to come. We
will have a Party on Feb 13th at our current location at 1317 E. Pine
Street. 
Here
are some other ways you could participate and support us:

1
Shop in the store this next month

2
Create a gift registry for your next special event

3
Purchase a gift certificate for yourself or a friend

4 Tell your friends and family about our campaign5 Come party with us

<p>We’ve always had a dream - to <b>start a family business, like an Italian pizzeria</b> - passed down through generations, with a history and tradition behind it. With an original taste, a family atmosphere, full of passion, smiling faces and support from regular customers.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we have no idea how to make a pizza or run a restaurant, but… we do know the IT industry VERY well. That’s why we decided to start “Apperia” - a family startup that builds pizza...ehm, apps :) </p>
<p>Here we are - team of relatives with lots of IT relevant, innovative ideas:</p>

<p>First things first - what is the most important thing when creating a pizzeria? A great menu of course!</p>
<p>So, we’ve done a lot of research, observed the world around us, talked with lots of people around the world, had over 100 brainstorming sessions and created “a menu” - a list of fresh mobile apps we want to build for everyone. To give everyone joy, to make every life easier and happier. Currently we have several <b>innovative apps in mind that we want to create.</b> The main, healthy “ingredients” are: a bunch of organic personal data, a cup of great user experiences, a few tablespoons of bio commercial, mixed with new technologies and a pinch of high quality passion, plus the essential secret ingredients (just a few !).</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1205732/files/20150208043340-secrets.png?1423398820"" src="""" style=""width: 100%; margin: 20px 0px;""/></p>
<h3 style=""margin-top: 25px;"">“Waiter! There’s a hair in my soup! Call the chef!!”</h3>
<p>Ok, so, we’ve got a menu. What next?<br/>
    Friendly, kind-hearted and happy staff that create a warm atmosphere. In our family, we’ve got a manager that will keep the business running, we’ve got waiters and bartenders (SEOs and marketers) and interior decorators (UX designer and graphic designer) but what <b>we are missing</b> is…  <b>...an experienced pizzaiolo – the chef, maestro, pizza virtuoso.</b> Actually, a software developer that will make those apps.  </p>

Apps are often like pizzas - they can bring a smile to your face and make your life feel better - even bring you joy! Like the Margherita pizza changed the 19th century, our apps will change today.


From the rendezvous to the idea
We’ve always had a dream - to start a family business, like an Italian pizzeria - passed down through generations, with a history and tradition behind it. With an original taste, a family atmosphere, full of passion, smiling faces and support from regular customers.
Unfortunately, we have no idea how to make a pizza or run a restaurant, but… we do know the IT industry VERY well. That’s why we decided to start “Apperia” - a family startup that builds pizza...ehm, apps :) 
Here we are - team of relatives with lots of IT relevant, innovative ideas:


Interactive Director - professional and sophisticated in wide front-end technology. Started coding websites after started reading and writing. Knows how people interact with applications and electronic devices. Interested in mobile world and promising new, unconventional technology. Passionate and dedicated his creativity. Worked with various companies, from small to huge what helped understand different way of thinking. Loved working with people and being a mentor. Sensitive on pixel perfect precision. Agile methodology believer.



Product Manager - qualified expert with continuous experience in broad range of product management and marketing roles. Specialised in mobile and cloud with strong technical background. Visionary of new products driven by market needs. Precursor of innovative solutions and founder of many prototypes which turned into real successful products used by thousands of users. Obsessed with making people much more productive in business and daily activities.



UX Designer - over 8 years of experience in user interfaces creation and products development by concentrating on users' needs rather than on particular pieces of interface or styles. Worked for various of companies - from small creative agencies to well known, international IT giants. Lived in, worked, and travelled to many countries across the world which helped to better understand cultural differences and user needs. Coach, mentor, startup supporter, academic lecturer and a very energetic person.



Technical Program Manager - dedicated and skilled program manager, with over 7 years in technical projects - from small internal tools to highly innovative cloud solutions for Fortune TOP500 giants. Excellent leader, coach and technical trainer successful in managing programs/projects budgets (over $1M) and schedules, in fast-paced, enterprise environment. Ingenious influencer with extensive hands-on background in cloud computing, virtualization and mobile solutions. 



Ingredients we love
First things first - what is the most important thing when creating a pizzeria? A great menu of course!
So, we’ve done a lot of research, observed the world around us, talked with lots of people around the world, had over 100 brainstorming sessions and created “a menu” - a list of fresh mobile apps we want to build for everyone. To give everyone joy, to make every life easier and happier. Currently we have several innovative apps in mind that we want to create. The main, healthy “ingredients” are: a bunch of organic personal data, a cup of great user experiences, a few tablespoons of bio commercial, mixed with new technologies and a pinch of high quality passion, plus the essential secret ingredients (just a few !).

“Waiter! There’s a hair in my soup! Call the chef!!”
Ok, so, we’ve got a menu. What next?
    Friendly, kind-hearted and happy staff that create a warm atmosphere. In our family, we’ve got a manager that will keep the business running, we’ve got waiters and bartenders (SEOs and marketers) and interior decorators (UX designer and graphic designer) but what we are missing is…  ...an experienced pizzaiolo – the chef, maestro, pizza virtuoso. Actually, a software developer that will make those apps.  
 
So here’s where You can help us.
Help us hire the best developers to bring our “pizzas” to life, so we can deliver them to the mobile world. Of course it’s not only about hiring the talent, it's also about their training, a good environment and the right atmosphere at work. Help us expand their talents in a good way, in a company that will help them grow and will take good care of them and their work.

So what can we serve?
We think that the best way to say “Thank You” is to give something back.
    When our apps are ready, You’ll get them according to this model:

5$ donation - Blue Card - 1 free pro app version.


A baker’s dozen!

<p>Imagine you are a husband whose wife was in a terrible car accident and now suffers from debilitating and constant pain. </p>

Imagine you are a mother with a happy healthy child. Suddenly one day your child starts to have seizures and becomes unresponsive. The seizures become more and more frequent and your child is in pain and unable to do any of the things that used to make them happy.
Imagine you are a husband whose wife was in a terrible car accident and now suffers from debilitating and constant pain. 
Imagine you have worked hard your whole life in a 50 hour a week job and are now retired. You deserve to have your retirement be easy and laid back but you have a repetitive stress injury and laying back to rest causes you extreme pain.
Now imagine if someone came up to each of these people and offered them a solution to their pain, to their stressful lifestyle of caring for a loved one, offered them a natural solution to their family member’s pain? And imagine if the solution could be delivered to their door?
This is where our company, GoDoja comes in.  We understand that for many patients, accessing a licensed facility is difficult. GoDoja will make that process easier for these deserving patients.
We are creating an online marketplace where consumers can shop, compare, rate, and buy cannabis products from many different sources and dispensaries for pickup or delivery. In addition, we will phase in supporting services like aiding consumers in registering and renewing with their state, allowing independent doctors to video conference with and prescribe to patients, and enabling UBER-style independent drivers for delivering products. 
In addition to the front end marketplace, we have discovered that dispensaries are facing a wide variety of integration problems which are preventing them from fully scaling. Many of these problems are relatively simple to solve once we have all of the integration pieces needed for the GoDoja marketplace. To provide additional incentives for dispensaries to partner with us, we will provide an array of back office tools that dispensaries can utilize to streamline their operations.

<br/><p>It is also very hard for the dental practice to track a patient that has been given a referral.  The dentist will wonder if the patient scheduled an appointment with the specialist or if the patient received the treatment that they needed?  It is near impossible to know the answers to these questions with the outdated referral system that is currently used by many dentists.</p>
<p>I have set out to conquer all of the problems associated with the current method of referring dental patients from office to office.</p>
<p>Relay Referral is an e-referral solution that will quickly transmit private patient information from office to office via a secure HIPAA compliant network.  Relay Referral will posses a simple intuitive interface that will allow the referring doctor to quickly select the destination office from a list of saved, commonly used contacts.  The patients private information, images, dental notes and additional pertinent information can easily be attached to the referral and quickly sent over the secure HIPAA compliant network.  The destination doctor would receive instant notification, through the secure application, that a patient has been referred to their practice.  The referral could then be reviewed along with the patients private information, images, chart notes and other pertinent information.</p>
<p>Relay Referral also makes two way communication a breeze.  Once the patient receives the necessary treatment, an update to the  referral can be sent back to the original dentist explaining the treatment received, any complications or outcomes of the procedure.</p>
<p>Relay will also give the user the ability to set automatic notifications.  Lets say a patient never schedules an appointment or receives treatment with the specialist where they were referred, a notification can be sent back to you explaining that there are no updates for the patient and that they should be contacted, via Relay Referral, to follow up with either office.</p>
<p>Relay Referral can be customized to meet the needs of any dental practice.  It will offer a quick and secure method for referring patients from office to office.  It will give dental offices the ability to track their patients and ensure they are receiving beneficial dental care.  It will greatly reduce the inefficiencies and lost time that the current, outdated referral system poses, which will increase dental practice efficiency, security, and provide improved treatment outcomes for patients.</p>
<p>Every contribution received will be instrumental in providing a solid foundation for Relay Referral.  We have already selected a reputable team that focuses all of their time and energy on creating amazing web applications.  All of these contributions will allow them to complete the initial research and definition of terms and functions.  They will also be able to complete the detailed outline for the project, define the database, and complete the wire framing for the entire web application.  This is the most crucial aspect of the project since any programming will be based on this blueprint.  A strong foundation will create a solid performing web application that will have exceptional functionality, unmatched aesthetics and be a breeze to use.</p>

<div style=""text-align: justify;"">I am Larisa and together with my family I've been living on the beautiful island of Rhodes, Greece for the last 16 years. My husband Victor is a very talented interior designer, craftsman and musician; our daughter Nefeli - a 16 years old, ongoing musician (playing flute, piano, cello and double bass), our son Aris - a 12 years old (playing drums and saxophone) and myself - a professional massage therapist, trying to be creative with ceramics and jewelry making.<br/><br/>

<h3>The house that needs us all ...</h3>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<br/>Being always in love with the beautiful old buildings of Rhodes, we decided to save one from falling apart and with Victor's last savings we bought it this January. The house was built in the 1870s and it's part of the so called ""<i>Pyrgospita</i>"" - tower houses in the west part of the island.<br/><br/>

<div style=""text-align: justify;"">Our project has two phases: the first one for which we need a contractor (restoring the walls, changing the roof and repairing the floors, installing new windows and doors) and a second phase which we will do it by ourselves (build the needed furniture and decorate the interior and exterior of the house).</div>

<div><br/></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">Our contractor estimates the restoring of the walls, changing the roof and repairing the floors at approximately 35.000 euro and installing new windows and doors at about 15.000 euro.<br/><br/>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The village goes by two names , one is <i>Ialysos </i>- together with Lindos and Kamiros being one of the 3 ancient cities of the island, and the other name is <i>Trianda </i>- it means 30 and comes from the number of tower houses (pyrgospita)  built in the area in the 19th century by the wealthy residents of the city of Rhodes (turkish, greeks and italians) as summer houses due to the cooler breeze on the west of the island. <br/><br/></p>
<p>The house we are renovating is one of the last ""standing"" so it's of vital importance for the local community and as well for people all over the world visiting Rhodes.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Everyone will be able to enjoy it's beauty and serenity once the renovation process is complete as we intend to use it as a guest house and as a creativity meeting point for artists from everywhere hosting workshops and exhibitions of any artistic genre. </p>

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p> </div> <h3>Thank you so much for your support!</h3></div>","Dear friends,
I am Larisa and together with my family I've been living on the beautiful island of Rhodes, Greece for the last 16 years. My husband Victor is a very talented interior designer, craftsman and musician; our daughter Nefeli - a 16 years old, ongoing musician (playing flute, piano, cello and double bass), our son Aris - a 12 years old (playing drums and saxophone) and myself - a professional massage therapist, trying to be creative with ceramics and jewelry making.


Meet the family


The house that needs us all ...

Being always in love with the beautiful old buildings of Rhodes, we decided to save one from falling apart and with Victor's last savings we bought it this January. The house was built in the 1870s and it's part of the so called ""Pyrgospita"" - tower houses in the west part of the island.



Plants were growing all around and inside the house



Garbage and its friends were living full time here

Unfortunately most of these historical houses were left to ruin due to people's lack of funding and they are literally falling down.


The backside with the garden
Details on the house front


With your help we can finish renovating it to it's original form and use it as a guest house and creative hub for artists (e.g. musicians, painters, photographers) from all over the world.




What We Need & What You Get


After we bought the house we started making a plan with the help of local architects and now we have the approved restoration blue prints, water and electrical connections on site and bought part of the construction materials. 





Our project has two phases: the first one for which we need a contractor (restoring the walls, changing the roof and repairing the floors, installing new windows and doors) and a second phase which we will do it by ourselves (build the needed furniture and decorate the interior and exterior of the house).



Our contractor estimates the restoring of the walls, changing the roof and repairing the floors at approximately 35.000 euro and installing new windows and doors at about 15.000 euro.



The village goes by two names , one is Ialysos - together with Lindos and Kamiros being one of the 3 ancient cities of the island, and the other name is Trianda - it means 30 and comes from the number of tower houses (pyrgospita)  built in the area in the 19th century by the wealthy residents of the city of Rhodes (turkish, greeks and italians) as summer houses due to the cooler breeze on the west of the island. 
The house we are renovating is one of the last ""standing"" so it's of vital importance for the local community and as well for people all over the world visiting Rhodes.

Everyone will be able to enjoy it's beauty and serenity once the renovation process is complete as we intend to use it as a guest house and as a creativity meeting point for artists from everywhere hosting workshops and exhibitions of any artistic genre. 


The perks!








A signed photograph postcard of the house delivered to your mailbox worldwide.




Hand made key-ring, with the logo of the house ""The plane-tree house"" on one side and with your name on the other side.   Plus a signed photo post-card of the house.



While having your holidays on the beautiful island of Rhodes, we'll make sure you'll enjoy a full hour of relaxation !  Plus a signed photograph of the house.






A long weekend (of 3 nights) accommodation and breakfast for two at the house you helped save from destruction so that you get to know the island and our family.



Or ...
A weekend (of 2 nights) accommodation and breakfast with two special sessions of aroma therapy relaxing massage to make you feel relaxed and invigorated.



This is our Premium Perk and your chance to spend your holidays together with your family in Rhodes, Greece!   We offer you one week of accommodation for 4 persons in the house and we will give you a day tour of the island!

My name is Irene Fulton, president of Sitealicious Inc, and I am seeking funding to support my  project ""<b>Websites From The Heart</b>"".   As a web designer and developer for over 17 years now, I am often approached by charities and other non-profit organizations seeking help to get them online with a website and social media presence.  However, since these groups have limited resources and since I am limited as well in how much work I can extend for free or after-hours, I usually have to reduce the scope of what gets done for them in the short-term or turn these folks away until they can afford to purchase services.  <br/></p>
<p>I've created ""<b>Websites From The Heart</b>"" in order to bridge this gap.  I want to try to realize this dream to ensure that any charity or non-profit that needs a website can get one. <br/></p>
<p>With the ever-increasing importance of digital communications in our everyday lives, ""<b>Websites From The Heart</b>"" aims to ensure that the agents of positive change in our local communities and around the world have the means to participate in online dialogue.<br/></p>
<p>When you donate to ""<b>Websites From The Heart</b>"" you'll be helping a charity or non-profit organization receive a quality website at no cost to their group or cause.  The website that they receive will be customized with their logo, be fully-featured to their requirements and connected to popular social media accounts on sites such as Twitter and Facebook.  If they don't have these accounts, we will create these social pages as well to match the look and feel of the website we make.  Their web pages will be editable by any lay person with a minimal degree of technical proficiency in order to promote self-sufficiency online.  <br/></p>
<p>And very importantly, their website will include the ability to collect donations online, thus promoting future self-sustainability.  <br/></p>Providing websites to charities and non-profit organizations will help ensure that the important work being done by these groups in our communities, towns and cities around the world can continue to enrich our lives!<br/><p><br/></p>
<h3>Who We Want To Help</h3>
<p>""<b>Websites From The Heart</b>"" is looking to work with charities and non-profits endeavoring to improve the human condition. Our focus is humanitarian in nature. We want to connect with people who are helping people, with people being the main beneficiaries of the group's goals.</p>
<b>Focal Areas</b>:
<ul>
<li>Arts &amp; Culture - helping people grow through the arts<br/>
</li>
<li>Health &amp; Wellness - helping people heal through wellness programs<br/>
</li>
<li>Social Progress - helping people gain all types of equality<br/>
</li>
<li>The Environment - helping people steward our resources</li>
</ul>
<p>""<b>Websites From The Heart</b>"" does not work with projects that are allied with political or religious movements 
for the majority purpose of proselytizing that agenda.  <br/><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need<br/>
</h3> <p>As a pilot project, we are looking for enough capital to fund 10 websites. Each small website of this nature costs on average about $1470 to create. The total amount we hope to raise is $14700, but if we raise more, we will build more! <br/></p>
<p>Each site typically takes between 30 - 50 working hours, from initial consultation, design mock-up, website set-up, graphic work. logo design and functionality testing to the final delivered product.  These costs are primarily labour-related, meaning it is time spent in 
front of the computer by a person working specifically on setting up the
 site and creating social media accounts.  This includes material donated by ""<b>Websites From The Heart</b>"" digital caregivers in order to keep our costs as low as possible.  Digital Caregivers are folks who believe in what we are trying to do and volunteer with us in their area of expertise.<br/></p>
<p><b>Each Charity or Non-Profit Will Receive</b>:</p> <ul> <li>Wordpress Setup</li> <li>Up To 8 Pages In Size<br/>
</li> <li>Custom Logo (If A Logo Is Needed)</li>
<li>Customized Web Look and Feel<br/>
</li>
<li>All Relevant Plugins Installed</li>
<li>Fully Responsive Design (Works On Phones Or Desktops)</li>
<li>Search Engine Friendly</li>
<li>Integration with Social Media</li>

<li>Capable Of Receiving Donations<br/><br/>
</li>
</ul>

</h3>
<h3>
</h3>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>Our perks work on a ""give and get"" principle:</p> <ul>
<li>Give enough to help get a link to a charitable website, you receive a link from our site <a href=""http://www.websitesfromtheheart.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.websitesfromtheheart.com</a><br/>
</li>
<li>Give enough to support the creation of social media profiles, you get one new (or redesigned) social media profile page<br/>
</li>
<li>Give enough to fund a whole website donation to someone else, you get a mini Wordpress or responsive one-pager website of your very own!  <b>Give a site, get a site</b>!  Awesome!<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<br/><h3>The Impact</h3> <p>The ""<b>Websites From The Heart</b>"" project is intended to address the very real problems charities and non-profit organizations face - how to get their message into the world when they can't afford to get their message into the world.  You will be helping these organizations continue and expand their day-to-day work, but most importantly, you will be helping them become self-sustaining.  Having the ability to raise funds from the www on their own enables ongoing growth and success and an element of autonomy for the long-term.  Having a professional web presence to share with others is one of the most vital elements to spreading the message!  <b>Be a part of it</b>!</p>
</div> <div> <h3>
<br/>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> There are few risks to this project.  Every amount raised in multiples of $1470 funds one website.  We will make as many websites with our digital caregiving partners as funds we raise.  If we raise enough for 10 sites, we will create 10 sites.  If we raise enough for 100 sites, that's what's going to happen, and WOW are we going to be busy!  The progress of our fundraising efforts and the resulting websites created will be chronicled on our own website blog at <a href=""http://www.websitesfromtheheart.com."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.websitesfromtheheart.com.</a>  <br/></p> <ul> <li>If for any reason I am not able to coordinate these projects, I have a partner ready to take on the work of ensuring all funds go towards getting our charity partners online.<br/>
</li>
<li>If we are able to fundraise enough to create WAY more sites than I can reasonably coordinate, I have a network of digital caregivers ready to outsource to and I'll still be overseeing all projects to retain high quality control.<br/>
</li>
</ul> </div> <div> <h3>
<br/>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you can't contribute, can you help spread the word?  Share in your social networks, share us with charities and non-profit organizations you know could use our help and services - and then those members can actually fundraise enough through our fundraiser to get their sites created too!</p> <ul> <li>Make some noise for us and help us help the world!<br/>

""Websites From The Heart"" is looking to work with charities and non-profits endeavoring to improve the human condition. Our focus is humanitarian in nature. We want to connect with people who are helping people, with people being the main beneficiaries of the group's goals.
Focal Areas:

Arts & Culture - helping people grow through the arts

Health & Wellness - helping people heal through wellness programs

Social Progress - helping people gain all types of equality

The Environment - helping people steward our resources

""Websites From The Heart"" does not work with projects that are allied with political or religious movements 
for the majority purpose of proselytizing that agenda.  
  What We Need
 As a pilot project, we are looking for enough capital to fund 10 websites. Each small website of this nature costs on average about $1470 to create. The total amount we hope to raise is $14700, but if we raise more, we will build more! 
Each site typically takes between 30 - 50 working hours, from initial consultation, design mock-up, website set-up, graphic work. logo design and functionality testing to the final delivered product.  These costs are primarily labour-related, meaning it is time spent in 
front of the computer by a person working specifically on setting up the
 site and creating social media accounts.  This includes material donated by ""Websites From The Heart"" digital caregivers in order to keep our costs as low as possible.  Digital Caregivers are folks who believe in what we are trying to do and volunteer with us in their area of expertise.
Each Charity or Non-Profit Will Receive:  Wordpress Setup Up To 8 Pages In Size
 Custom Logo (If A Logo Is Needed)
Customized Web Look and Feel

All Relevant Plugins Installed
Fully Responsive Design (Works On Phones Or Desktops)
Search Engine Friendly
Integration with Social Media
Twitter, Facebook and Google+ page
Contact Form with Google Map
Capable Of Receiving Donations


    



What You Get
Our perks work on a ""give and get"" principle: 
Give enough to help get a link to a charitable website, you receive a link from our site http://www.websitesfromtheheart.com

Give enough to support the creation of social media profiles, you get one new (or redesigned) social media profile page

Give enough to fund a whole website donation to someone else, you get a mini Wordpress or responsive one-pager website of your very own!  Give a site, get a site!  Awesome!


The Impact The ""Websites From The Heart"" project is intended to address the very real problems charities and non-profit organizations face - how to get their message into the world when they can't afford to get their message into the world.  You will be helping these organizations continue and expand their day-to-day work, but most importantly, you will be helping them become self-sustaining.  Having the ability to raise funds from the www on their own enables ongoing growth and success and an element of autonomy for the long-term.  Having a professional web presence to share with others is one of the most vital elements to spreading the message!  Be a part of it!
  
Risks & Challenges  There are few risks to this project.  Every amount raised in multiples of $1470 funds one website.  We will make as many websites with our digital caregiving partners as funds we raise.  If we raise enough for 10 sites, we will create 10 sites.  If we raise enough for 100 sites, that's what's going to happen, and WOW are we going to be busy!  The progress of our fundraising efforts and the resulting websites created will be chronicled on our own website blog at http://www.websitesfromtheheart.com.    If for any reason I am not able to coordinate these projects, I have a partner ready to take on the work of ensuring all funds go towards getting our charity partners online.

If we are able to fundraise enough to create WAY more sites than I can reasonably coordinate, I have a network of digital caregivers ready to outsource to and I'll still be overseeing all projects to retain high quality control.

   
Other Ways You Can Help If you can't contribute, can you help spread the word?  Share in your social networks, share us with charities and non-profit organizations you know could use our help and services - and then those members can actually fundraise enough through our fundraiser to get their sites created too!  Make some noise for us and help us help the world!

</h3> <p><b>We are a community group of about ten people who have been gathering for two and a half years to co-create a dream we all share: Thriving together on a beautiful piece of land out in nature with our friends and family.  </b>We also share a passion for holistic healing and are creating a healing center where people can come to learn more about all aspects of healthy living.  This retreat center where many of the healers will live on-site will be the location for our wide variety of classes and workshops as well as longer retreats and conferences.  Our group also currently hosts activities in which we offer healing to the public, including those with limited resources.<br/></p>
<p>In addition to providing the community with wellness resources, we will also offer permaculture and natural building certification courses.  We will be taking steps to learn all we can about living lightly on the planet and growing our own organic food.  Other ideas we envision for our future eco-village include a birthing 
center, a hostel, a bed and breakfast and a you-pick berry farm.  We plan to serve as a model for others to emulate, making sure to keep all of our village building information public for use as open-source documents.  <br/></p>
<p>Once Emerald Grove is complete, the long-term goal is to replicate similar villages world-wide and link them all.  We are creating a huge network of like-minded individuals who feel passionately about natural, simple, peaceful living.  People will then be able to travel from one village to the next, contributing their expertise and skills as they go.</p>
<p>Our group shares an optimistic view of the current state of the world, 
knowing that we have the power to co-create our future together.  We are
 also taking practical measures to prepare for the realities of 
dwindling global resources and growing populations.  We would like to serve as a
 harbinger of change, inviting all those who resonate with our values 
and message to support us in this challenge.  <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Planting the seeds of change<br/>
</h3> <p><b>We excitedly anticipate raising enough money to cover the costs of starting a 501(c)3 federal non-profit corporation called the Co-Creative Living Foundation as well as those related to beginning the search for land to call home. </b> We have been working with a local lawyer who specializes in serving non-profits and we plan to have him oversee the process of incorporation.  We are looking to keep costs as low as possible, finding ways to save and accomplish tasks on our own whenever we can.</p>
<p>Building a village will obviously take much more than $3,000, so this is only the beginning!  We anticipate getting a little startup cash from you, our devoted supporters, to get us off the ground.  Once we have non-profit standing we will begin applying for grants and partnering with existing non-profits.  <i>Donations will all be put towards these IRS fees and startup costs mentioned above, regardless of the final outcome of this campaign.</i><br/></p>
<p>One of our founders has experience helping another local community acquire a 60-acre piece of lake front property with a conference center as a gift with no money down.  We, too, are confident that we may acquire the land needed for our eco-village in a similar manner, based solely on the purity of our collective intentions.  Hence, we are sharing our dream for the right investors to catch wind of it.  In the meantime we are rallying support from donors large and small to get the ball rolling! </p>
<p><b>Each contribution will be rewarded,</b> whether with good karma, a personal healing session with one of our esteemed community healers or a week-long retreat at our future healing center and eco-village complete with organic meals from our garden.  We appreciate all levels of support, since our community is designed to facilitate ways for everyone to get involved to the level at which they feel comfortable. <br/></p>

</h3>
<p><b>The success of this project is essential for helping people to start taking control of their world once again.  </b>Too long have we been 
controlled by mass media and corporations!  It is time to bring the focus 
back to ourselves, our families and our communities.  We can choose how 
we live and with whom we create community.  That is the beauty of 
intentional communities!  <br/></p>
<p><b>We, the members of Emerald Grove, share a common vision of a green future.</b>  What does that mean?  It means the world we envision functions sustainably with renewable energy and resources.  It means the people act as stewards of the earth, taking actions each day to lessen our carbon footprints, leaving this planet better than we found it.  It means people live peacefully on earth, always looking for ways to improve communication and interpersonal relationships.<br/></p>
<p>We are coming together to co-create this world, creating a strong bond among community members.  We are healing ourselves and each other, making us better able to be of service.  We are learning to build homes using natural materials found locally.  We are experimenting with new forms of commerce including trade, barter and the gift economy.  <br/></p>
<p>We are learning to grow life-affirming organic foods and use them to cook delicious healthy meals.  We are learning ways of planting that can utilize nature for pest control and nutrient building in the soil.  We are learning how to grow food using aquaponics and create a safe supply of mercury- and radiation-free fish for our community to eat.  </p>
<p>We are creating a community of inter-generational members.  We value everyone, from children to elders, and find that interactions between different age groups are beneficial for all. We envision our village having about 20 members to start plus however many children they bring along.  Everyone will be an influence to our youngest members, and will do their best to teach and learn with them about healthy living.  <br/></p>
<p>Classes and workshops will be the central focus of the retreat center, as well as an in-town healing clinic (the clinic exists now.)  We will offer classes on many health-related topics, as well as permaculture, natural building.  This way, we can offer our knowledge and skills and also host instructors from all over the globe. Conferences will be held at our center, featuring some of the world's foremost experts on new-paradigm topics such as quantum physics, spirituality, holistic healing, midwifery, non-violent communication, sustainability, permaculture and bioremediation. </p>
<p><b>Since this is just the first chapter of an epic adventure tale of one community helping to start a movement, the whole world can benefit!</b>  We will take our village-building skills on the road, linking new communities to existing ones and creating a vast network of positive change hubs.  <i>Your contributions will keep us moving as we do what we can to bring balance to the planet and it's people. </i><br/></p>

This active ingredient is permanently bound to the fabric’s fibers and is designed to remain effective throughout the life of the product, even after as many as to 70 washings.<br/><br/><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p><img alt=""nfz graphic"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.burlington.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/nfz-graphic.png"" src="""" style=""width: 407.744px; height: 301px;""/><br/></p><p><i>Registered with the EPA, No Fly Zone Insect repellent technology works as a contact repellent.  NFZ affects the insect's nervous system causing ""hot foot"", making the insect fly away before it may bite.  This technology works to prevent the spread of insect borne diseases by repelling insects away from the body through apparel or gear.</i><br/></p><br/><h2>Why should you support us?</h2>Based on our early success, we know our Made in USA products are well received and have kept dogs safe nationwide.  We have kept Dog Not Gone an efficient business model.  The company is run out of our home and the only employees are myself and my husband Bill.  All labor is outsourced to our own manufacturing facility where we are able to control quality and employ just in time inventory.  <br/><br/>We purchased our manufacturing facility last year when the owner told us he was retiring and closing the doors in the Fall.  Bill and I made the decision that we wanted to keep our products Made in USA so we made the investment and secured the employment of the 10 seamstresses, many of whom have been working there for 30 years.   <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1362308/files/20150407064143-MaineStitching-0149_720x480_72_RGB.jpg?1428414103"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><br/>What we need now is help to put our new line of No Fly Zone dog vests into production.  Your support will help us with working capital to sustain this growth and better position our business in this competitive market.<br/><br/>If we can surpass our goal, we will apply the funds toward 
development of a new line of tick repellent products for people.  We 
have started the development process of gaitors that are worn above the 
sock to protect against ticks when walking through the woods or fields.

This active ingredient is permanently bound to the fabric’s fibers and is designed to remain effective throughout the life of the product, even after as many as to 70 washings.Registered with the EPA, No Fly Zone Insect repellent technology works as a contact repellent.  NFZ affects the insect's nervous system causing ""hot foot"", making the insect fly away before it may bite.  This technology works to prevent the spread of insect borne diseases by repelling insects away from the body through apparel or gear.Why should you support us?Based on our early success, we know our Made in USA products are well received and have kept dogs safe nationwide.  We have kept Dog Not Gone an efficient business model.  The company is run out of our home and the only employees are myself and my husband Bill.  All labor is outsourced to our own manufacturing facility where we are able to control quality and employ just in time inventory.  We purchased our manufacturing facility last year when the owner told us he was retiring and closing the doors in the Fall.  Bill and I made the decision that we wanted to keep our products Made in USA so we made the investment and secured the employment of the 10 seamstresses, many of whom have been working there for 30 years.   What we need now is help to put our new line of No Fly Zone dog vests into production.  Your support will help us with working capital to sustain this growth and better position our business in this competitive market.If we can surpass our goal, we will apply the funds toward 
development of a new line of tick repellent products for people.  We 
have started the development process of gaitors that are worn above the 
sock to protect against ticks when walking through the woods or fields. 
 Other items that we plan on developing include vests, tshirts and hats.Our campaign will contribute
 a percentage of monies raised during this campaign to our local 
shelter, Franklin County Animal Shelter.   We adopted our dog, Max, from this shelter and continue to support them in any way we can.In return for your contribution, you will be one of the first to own a No Fly Zone tick and insect repellent dog vest at a discounted price.  We have a variety of our tick repellent products in the rewards program for your support.  We will ship your products out in June so that you can defend your dog against ticks and other biting insects.Another way you can help is to spread the word about our campaign.  Word of mouth has been the foundation of building our business. Your support will not only help launch our new product line, it will create real jobs for Americans and helps preserve Maine’s time honored textile tradition.  And I thank you very much for that.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>Risk &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>There are risks and challenges in everything you do in life. That
being said, I believe I thought of this project for a reason beyond
myself.  I thought long and hard about
the money it will require to adequately fund a location that will enable others
to enjoy the benefits of being charged low costs.</p>
<p>The main challenge is funding. I’d like to open this business and make
it successful, while staying true to my initial plan to help others. Therefore,
raising more money is extremely important. Fear of not reaching my goal is a
bit intimidating, however, I'm a strong believer that my blessings will
continue to flourish by helping others. </p>
<p>In the event I do not reach my goal, I will continue to work extremely
hard to bring this project I have worked so hard on to light. :)</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>The services Petite Fete offers for free or minimal costs are not
available anywhere else. The potential for cost-savings is tremendous  for our local non-profits, entrepreneurs and
artists. I hope to give these individuals the opportunity to spend more time
developing their ideas, building their networks, and sharing their greatness
with our city while spending less time worrying about how they will foot the
cost and still make a profit.</p>
<p><b>Other Ways To Help</b></p>
<p>There are so many ways you can contribute, even if you
cannot show your support financially:  </p>

<p>Arizona Extreme Sports Camp is a non-profit extreme sports camp for kids.  Our goal is to crate a safe and constructive environment for kids.  The kids in our community need a place to learn. grow, and become motivated in a positive way.  We can help teach our kids to share, protect each other, trust one another, self motivation, determination, pride, setting goals, rewarding self improvement, and so much more.  I personally believe for every opportunity we provide for our kids is one more kid we keep safe and goal oriented.  The more we teach the better the kids will learn.  Activities such as camping, survival skills, rock climbing, mountain biking, hiking, river rafting, snow skiing, snowboarding, water skiing,  skateboarding, dirt biking, trust exercises, carpentry, and many more activities as we expand and grow.  Our wish is for a new future for our kids and ourselves.  With donations, volunteers, and sponsorships we will help all of our kids become the best, brightest,and the most motivated  and goal oriented individuals, in the first few steps to their bright futures.<br/><br/><br/>MUCH MORE TO COME……….</p>

<div>
<p>We are proud to announce the official release from the state of Arizona to conduct operations, fundraising, and all other aspects for us to get the doors open as soon as possible. The website will be built as soon as enough funds are raised. A bank account will be open in the next few days.</p>
<p>If you would like to see our funding goals, look at all the recent updates in the past few months. In the next few days we will be organizing details and hopefully receiving checks for donations. The more funding the faster the property is purchased, developed, and open for use. Liability insurance is another big step in the right direction. Again, all depends on funds being donated for operations and purchasing or leasing land.</p>
<p>Look for updates about an address to send donations. We will also be accepting donations through credit card donations.</p>
<p>Life is good if we spread our love in every direction. Our future kids involved in our programs will be thrilled and excell in life through our experience and lessons. Hope to be hearing back from our followers.</p>
<p>Thank you to all whom reads the posts. I hope one day we will all be at the grand opening of Arizona Extreme Sports Camp Non-profit organization. Built for our youth and future of our communities.</p>

<p></p>
<div>The new generation of inspiration has begun. The first step has been taken to create a new life for our kids in Arizona and across the country. The Arizona Extreme Sports Camp non profit organization is here to help our local kids be more productive in society and learn new lessons in life to teach other kids in the future.<br/><br/>Our goal is to inspire our youth to find different ways to explore their environment and positive activities. Most children do not have an opportunity to explore the possibilities of hiking, camping, outdoor survival skills, mountain biking, rock climbing, dirt biking, wake boarding, water skiing, snowboarding, snow skiing, and so many other extreme sports and positive activities to be explore.<br/><br/>The world is endless for a positive place for our future productive adults in our communities. We are here to help and provide a safe place for our kids.<br/><br/>There is only one way to change the future and we start with our youth and expand their possibilities of a bright future.<br/><br/>Sports and extreme activities take the edge off of the daily grind our kids go through everyday. Our kids find destructive and misleading activities when they are bored or just tired of listening to the world around them. Our goal is to change the less fortunate kids lives into a positive and enlightening world around them.<br/><br/>Once a month there will be three different activities for the kids to participate in. Hopefully with the combined efforts of everyone in our communities. We all can raise money to put our organizations dream in production to help create new dreams for our kids.<br/><br/>Our dream for your futures starts with all of us coming together and donating for this cause.

MAKING DREAMS BECOMING REALITY
Helping our kids now….  Will create a bright future.
EXPLORE HEREPAVING OUR OWN PATH

Arizona Extreme Sports Camp is a non-profit extreme sports camp for kids.  Our goal is to crate a safe and constructive environment for kids.  The kids in our community need a place to learn. grow, and become motivated in a positive way.  We can help teach our kids to share, protect each other, trust one another, self motivation, determination, pride, setting goals, rewarding self improvement, and so much more.  I personally believe for every opportunity we provide for our kids is one more kid we keep safe and goal oriented.  The more we teach the better the kids will learn.  Activities such as camping, survival skills, rock climbing, mountain biking, hiking, river rafting, snow skiing, snowboarding, water skiing,  skateboarding, dirt biking, trust exercises, carpentry, and many more activities as we expand and grow.  Our wish is for a new future for our kids and ourselves.  With donations, volunteers, and sponsorships we will help all of our kids become the best, brightest,and the most motivated  and goal oriented individuals, in the first few steps to their bright futures.MUCH MORE TO COME……….




THANK YOU TO EVERYONE
4/24/2015



We are proud to announce the official release from the state of Arizona to conduct operations, fundraising, and all other aspects for us to get the doors open as soon as possible. The website will be built as soon as enough funds are raised. A bank account will be open in the next few days.
If you would like to see our funding goals, look at all the recent updates in the past few months. In the next few days we will be organizing details and hopefully receiving checks for donations. The more funding the faster the property is purchased, developed, and open for use. Liability insurance is another big step in the right direction. Again, all depends on funds being donated for operations and purchasing or leasing land.
Look for updates about an address to send donations. We will also be accepting donations through credit card donations.
Life is good if we spread our love in every direction. Our future kids involved in our programs will be thrilled and excell in life through our experience and lessons. Hope to be hearing back from our followers.
Thank you to all whom reads the posts. I hope one day we will all be at the grand opening of Arizona Extreme Sports Camp Non-profit organization. Built for our youth and future of our communities.
Thank you again and God bless all of you.

Blessings to all!




POSITIVE INFLUENCE
2/1/2015
The dream in life for our children is a positive influence. Friends, family, teachers, coaches, and especially the outside world help creat the influence our children receive everyday. Media and daily interaction helps shape the kids in our lives. The interaction needs to be an influence towards a positive reaction. The reaction in our future extreme sports camp will be unrivaled. The experience and trust within our staff and volunteers will help shape a new future for our children in our communities. The motivation and daily involvement with the kids whom belong to our program will bring such joy and appreciation to everyone involved. The future is here and we as a non profit organization will make a new life for our communities to strive and build off of.

In the near future there will be updates on how to donate and participate in our future ventures.
We hope everyone has been in good health and full of blessing this New Year.

THE NEW WARM HEART FROM ARIZONA
12/16/2014


The new generation of inspiration has begun. The first step has been taken to create a new life for our kids in Arizona and across the country. The Arizona Extreme Sports Camp non profit organization is here to help our local kids be more productive in society and learn new lessons in life to teach other kids in the future.Our goal is to inspire our youth to find different ways to explore their environment and positive activities. Most children do not have an opportunity to explore the possibilities of hiking, camping, outdoor survival skills, mountain biking, rock climbing, dirt biking, wake boarding, water skiing, snowboarding, snow skiing, and so many other extreme sports and positive activities to be explore.The world is endless for a positive place for our future productive adults in our communities. We are here to help and provide a safe place for our kids.There is only one way to change the future and we start with our youth and expand their possibilities of a bright future.Sports and extreme activities take the edge off of the daily grind our kids go through everyday. Our kids find destructive and misleading activities when they are bored or just tired of listening to the world around them. Our goal is to change the less fortunate kids lives into a positive and enlightening world around them.Once a month there will be three different activities for the kids to participate in. Hopefully with the combined efforts of everyone in our communities. We all can raise money to put our organizations dream in production to help create new dreams for our kids.Our dream for your futures starts with all of us coming together and donating for this cause. Our future depends on you to donate today.May your year and life be full of blessings.Let's help make dreams come true.Our production Goals$150,000 of donations-Property and equipment will be  purchased$250,000 of donations-Activities will start with one per month$400,000 of donations-Trails and outposts will be built$750,000 of donations-More activities will be added$950,000 of donations-At these levels we will be able to maintain and provide more sports and activities$1,500,000+ donationsWill provide a cabin for overnight stays for activities.

Den norske skolen forvalter den største verdien nasjonen Norge har, nemlig barna våre.  Barna som skal bli selvstendige, trygge og bærekraftige voksne som skal være med å utvikle og berike samfunnet vårt videre. Hvem blir holdt ansvarlige og straffet når disse barna blir brutt ned til ingenting av de voksne som skal ivareta og utvikle de?I over 3 år nå har jeg kjempet det som mest sannsynligvis vil være mitt livs største kamp. Kampen om oppreisning og rettferd for min kjære umistelige sønn på 12 år. Hans situasjon er vond og tragisk………og, dessverre ikke unik. Jeg har prøvd å beskrive saken vår så ukomplisert og forståelig som mulig da det er umulig å beskrive alle aspektene ved den i et slikt innsamlingsprosjekt hvor jeg ber om den hjelpen jeg ber om. Ta gjerne kontakt om du/dere skulle ønske mer info :)Den 24 september 2015 blir Vår hjemkommune stevnet inn for Tingretten av meg på vegne av min sønn, og på vegne av alle barn som ikke får den hjelpen de etter loven skal ha. Jeg som mor og menneske kan ikke leve med at barn blir behandlet slik som min sønn har blitt i den norske skolen, og jeg kan ikke leve med at ingen blir holdt ansvarlig, hverken strafferettslig eller på annen måte. Rettsikkerheten til barna våre i skolen er svært mangelfull og det er foreldres ressurser, både økonomiske og psykiske som avgjør om barna våre får den hjelpen de trenger.Da jeg ikke oppfyller de økonomiske kravene for fri rettshjelp og har fått avslag på dette hos fylkesmannen er jeg forberedt på å ta saken i retten for egen hånd, helt uten juridisk bistand da jeg som alenemor ikke har økonomi til å betale for advokatbistand. Men jeg har håp, håp for rettssikkerheten til min sønn og andre barn og foreldre i lignende situasjon, håp om at noen kan hjelpe.En slik sak på vegne av min sønn vil koste, selv uten advokatbistand, så nå strekker jeg ut en hånd og ber om hjelp. Økonomisk hjelp til å kunne bruke kyndig juridisk bistand i kampen om rettferd og oppreisning. Denne situasjonen har allerede kostet oss, mye, både psykisk og økonomisk, men jeg nekter å gi opp, det kan jeg bare ikke. Kort og brutalt:Min sønn er en gutt på 12 år som har vært igjennom store traumer pga måten han har blitt behandlet på i grunnskolen. Han har over flere år blitt behandlet på en slik måte at hans psyke, selvtillit og egenfølelse og livskvalitet er brutt ned til omtrent ingenting.Min sønn ble over lengre tid mobbet av andre elever og av voksne ansatte/lærere/rektor. Senvirkningene av denne mobbingen er ille. Han viser tegn på posttraumatisk stress, sliter med selvmordstanker og har utviklet kraftig depresjon og sosial angst. Noe som har resultert i at vi nå sitter hjemme med en sønn som er livredd for å nærme seg skole og klasserom og som har mistet over 2 år med skolegang, lek, sosialisering og læring. Hans funksjonsnivåer er ekstremt tilbakesatt og han har tilnærmet ingen livskvalitet pr i dag.Dette kommer til å ta flere år å bearbeide, om han i det hele tatt blir frisk igjen. Senskadene ved slik behandling og mobbing generelt er massive, både for barnet som blir utsatt for det og familien rundt barnet. Ikke bare har vi foreldre lidd store psykiske belastninger og økonomiske tap i denne saken som følge av alt vi har vært igjennom, men lillesøster på 11 år har også vært igjennom mye og har måttet ofret mye av sin trygge barndom på bakgrunn av alt dette.Mer utdypende informasjon rundt historikken finnes på bloggen min:  http://episteme.blogg.no/1369302799_pent_brev_til_landets.htmlVi foreldre er tydelige på hvem vi mener har ansvar for det vår sønn har vært igjennom på skolen, hans psykiske helse pr i dag og familien rundt sine belastninger som følge av dette. Uansett hvilken grunnproblematikk ett barn har, uavhengig av diagnoser, sosiale vansker osv, er det alltid de voksnes ansvar at et barn blir ivaretatt i skolenAvtroppende barneombud i 2012, Reidar Hjermann, tok i et åpent avskjedsbrev til kunnskapsminister Kristin Halvorsen et kraftig oppgjør med innsatsen mot mobbing i skolen.

Halvparten av disse oppgir at de blir mobbet av voksne som arbeider i skolen. Fire av ti skoler i Norge har ikke fattet vedtak i mobbesaker slik opplæringsloven krever.  Vi foreldre står omtrent maktesløse i kampen for våre barn når skolen svikter på så grov måte  I 2012 klaget jeg inn kommunen/skolen til Fylkesmannen.

<h3>Meet Brian AM Williams - The Guy Behind It All</h3>
<div>Im a guy that loves to learn, loves to make a difference, loves to be dressed up, but doesn't take myself too seriously.  What I do take seriously is using the blessings of education and opportunity towards something greater than myself.  PurchaseBlack.com is how I do it, because I get to put real money into the hands of people who will use it to make life better for people with every sale on our website.</div>
<div>I have worked really hard all of my life, from poverty &amp; homelessness to the honors college of engineering at Purdue University, to a full tuition scholarship to McCombs MBA program, to founding my own small business.  Through it all, I have never lost the sense of doing something that helps others.  I hope that this campaign will help me be more effective.</div>

Im a guy that loves to learn, loves to make a difference, loves to be dressed up, but doesn't take myself too seriously.  What I do take seriously is using the blessings of education and opportunity towards something greater than myself.  PurchaseBlack.com is how I do it, because I get to put real money into the hands of people who will use it to make life better for people with every sale on our website.
I have worked really hard all of my life, from poverty & homelessness to the honors college of engineering at Purdue University, to a full tuition scholarship to McCombs MBA program, to founding my own small business.  Through it all, I have never lost the sense of doing something that helps others.  I hope that this campaign will help me be more effective.





    The Impact Research shows that when Black Businesses have increased revenue, special things happen.  They give to charity, they hire within their community, property values increase, crime decreases, unemployment decreases, and the community is a happier place.
By supporting Black owned businesses, you are supporting the best of what America has to offer, simply by buying great products in an intentional way.  We support making this into a reality, and we need you to be a hero to get us there!
    Risks & Challenges Online retail is a tough business.  To make sure we are successful, we are taking a smart approach.  We use smart partnerships with great organizations, only sell products that we trust and that will deliver on their promises, and make it a point to do business with integrity.  We know that other companies have similar goals, but we believe that we have something special with our education, traction, awards, and pure passion to make a difference.  The road is rough to realize big dreams, but we believe!  We are here to change the world!
    Other Ways You Can Help There are a million ways to help!  The greatest is with a donation!  We can't grow without them!  
Next is spreading the word.

You can volunteer your skills to PurchaseBlack as well.  We have lots of volunteers, and we'd be happy to have you!

<p>Since Rozan’s birth 15 years ago, we have been steadily raising an

<p>As in most developing countries, issues related to the emotional health

<p>The donations for building Rozan Ghar would help to provide sustained
and life transforming assistance to women and child survivors of violence and
contribute to promoting peace and harmony in Pakistan.</p>
<p>We have selected Malot area in Islamabad capital territory to domicile
Rozan Ghar, and have already successfully raised funds to secure four kanals (21,598

</ul>
</ul>
<ul><li><p>To encourage like minded individuals to take action in promoting Filipino culture in their own way by means of: blogs (wordpress, ‘morefuninthephilippines’), videos and activities.</p></li></ul>
<br/><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p> <ul> <li>I have set up a total budget estimated at £7000, I have saved up some money myself (about half of the budget) to make sure this trip happens at the very minimum.</li>
<li>I need your help to raise at least £2500 or more to make this project really come to life. The Money raised will allow me to visit even more key food destinations in the Philippines and participate in Culinary and cultural activities / events such as ""Madrid fusion Manila 2016"".</li>
<li>The money will also assist me by helping to pay for food, transportation and necessities for my 3 months duration in the Philippines.</li> <li>There are of course great perks as a way of saying thank you for contributing to my crowd fund, you can view this in the perks section of this page.</li> <li>If i do not achieve my target budget, the research for my project will be very limited as I will have to compromise on my spending.</li> </ul>
<div>
<p><span><b>AREAS OF FOCUS</b></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>HOUSEHOLD &amp; FAMILY (RECIPES): </b>I believe that the Filipino Household plays a crucial part in the essence of Filipino Cooking as many Filipino dishes are typically one pot cooking and food that was designed to share amongst the family kitchen table. It is vital that I visit different family households (especially my own) to see the dishes that they live on and the ingredients that sustain their livelihood</p></li>
<ul><li><p>I would like to design a questionnaire which will be answered by locals in different provinces and compare the data to see the differences and similarities.</p></li></ul>
<li><p><b>STREET FOOD: </b>I am interested  in learning about what is classified as Filipino street food , why it is so popular and how it is treated as a social part of Filipino livelihood.</p></li>
<li><p><b>MARKET / PALENGKE: </b>As a main source of food, produce &amp; materials. Its a Chef &amp; foodies dream to see all the exotic produce that is commonly found in the Philippines.</p></li>
<li><p><b>RESTAURANTS: </b>Visiting  the local Carinderias around the Philippines would give me a great idea of the most popular dishes in their region. Eating in Restaurants will also show me examples of how Chefs are innovating Filipino Cuisine in their own way.</p></li>
<li><p><b>SPECIFIC INGREDIENTS/ FLAVOURS -</b> Varieties of Rice, Coconuts and their many uses, the utilization of Vinegar, Our Love for Sour flavours, Calamansi, The unlimited uses for Pork, </p></li>
<li><p><b>INDIGENOUS FOOD:</b> A lot of the indigenous tribes have inhabited The Philippines long before the Spanish era of colonization would like to learn more about the Aeta and the Ifugao to understand more about the history of their origins and the food that they have lived on for so long and their methods of preparation.</p></li>
<li><p><b>AGRICULTURE - FARMING, FISHING</b></p></li>
<li><p><b>COOKING METHODS &amp; PRESERVING</b></p></li>
</ul>
<br/>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <ul> <li>By contributing, you are choosing to entrust me to become an ambassador for Filipino cuisine. As I embark on this incredible journey, I will do everything I can to record my experiences and knowledge gained to share with you.</li>
<li>How does this impact you and others? Whether Filipino or not, this culinary research expedition will be a leap in allowing me to pioneer contemporary Filipino Cuisine in London which brings us a step closer to making great Filipino food available to London and the British public.</li> </ul>
<div><b>WHY CHOOSE ME?</b></div>
<div>Although young, I have the drive and ambition to spearhead Filipino Cuisine into the UK. Here is a summary of work and achievements so far.</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><p><span>7 Years professional experience as a Chef.</span></p></li>
<li><p>Launched pop-up restaurants serving contemporary Filipino cuisine under the brand ‘LeHappyChef’ which soon gained followers. I have successfully run 4 pop-up restaurants events since</p></li>
<li><p>Over 1000 Followers on Twitter</p></li>
<li><p>Over 1100 Followers on Instagram</p></li>
<li><p>Over 1400 Likes combined on two Facebook pages </p></li>
<li><p>A Combined total of over 20,000 views on my Youtube Channel</p></li>
<li><p>Raised £1000 for ‘Bantay Bata 163’ by running a fine dining event which included a 5 course meal, live music and Filipino Cultural Dancers known as ‘Anahaw dance artists’.</p></li>
<li><p>Worked with other organizations within the ‘Filipino Food Movement’ such as ‘Next Day Better’ and ‘Maynila’</p></li>
<li><p>Co-Founded contemporary Filipino restaurant concept known as ‘LUZON’ and ran a 3 month pop-up restaurant in Russell Square </p></li>
<li><p>Most recently, I was requested by the Philippine Department of Tourism (PDOT) to prepare, cook and serve canapes for up to 500 guests at the World Travel Market 2015 in London Excel<span style=""background-color: initial;"">.</span></p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div><div>
<div>
<p><span><b><u>RISKS &amp; CONCERNS</u></b></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Safety &amp; Security</b> - My trip will involve communication as well as commuting. I am partnering up with a close friend, Rina Atienza, who will tour the 3 months with me but she has advised that we tour as a “Crew” which should be a minimum of 3 or 4 people including myself and Rina. This creates a sense of security in numbers.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Budget</b> - This project is quite ambitious as well as a long duration. The budget needs to be carefully broken down to cover all the necessary costs with extra funds for back up. The budget greatly affects all aspects of the project and will determine how much we can get done, what we can see, what we can spend on and how we can commute and document everything. We can reduce costs where possible but it would be a great deal of help to get assistance from others with discounts and accommodation.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Communication </b>- While a lot of Filipinos speak and understand english the mother tongue Tagalog is more widely used. Unfortunately I do not speak Tagalog so i may find it difficult in trying to communicate and create relationships with others in the Philippines. However, I am trying my best to learn basic Tagalog and I will be assisted by friends to help me communicate.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Food Hygiene -</b> Street food and Markets are commonly known to be more unhygienic due to less safer food preparation practices so I will have to be careful what I eat. </p></li>
</ul>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you believe in this trip but can't contribute money, you can still help!</p> <ul> <li>Please like the video, and share this crowd funding campaign with your friends and family to help spread awareness.</li> <li>You can do this with the indiegogo share tools provided!</li> </ul> </div> <p>Thank you for your time and consideration and I hope that you will contribute and support me in my effort to learn more about Filipino Cuisine and Culture to share with you.</p></div>","My name is Rex De Guzman, 23 years old, I am a British born Filipino born and raised in London.  Since the end of secondary school education, I had the desire to study and learn about the culinary arts and my passion and love for food developed during my college years.

What We Need & What You Get Break it down for folks in more detail:  I have set up a total budget estimated at £7000, I have saved up some money myself (about half of the budget) to make sure this trip happens at the very minimum.
I need your help to raise at least £2500 or more to make this project really come to life. The Money raised will allow me to visit even more key food destinations in the Philippines and participate in Culinary and cultural activities / events such as ""Madrid fusion Manila 2016"".
The money will also assist me by helping to pay for food, transportation and necessities for my 3 months duration in the Philippines. There are of course great perks as a way of saying thank you for contributing to my crowd fund, you can view this in the perks section of this page. If i do not achieve my target budget, the research for my project will be very limited as I will have to compromise on my spending. 

AREAS OF FOCUS

HOUSEHOLD & FAMILY (RECIPES): I believe that the Filipino Household plays a crucial part in the essence of Filipino Cooking as many Filipino dishes are typically one pot cooking and food that was designed to share amongst the family kitchen table. It is vital that I visit different family households (especially my own) to see the dishes that they live on and the ingredients that sustain their livelihood
I would like to design a questionnaire which will be answered by locals in different provinces and compare the data to see the differences and similarities.
STREET FOOD: I am interested  in learning about what is classified as Filipino street food , why it is so popular and how it is treated as a social part of Filipino livelihood.
MARKET / PALENGKE: As a main source of food, produce & materials. Its a Chef & foodies dream to see all the exotic produce that is commonly found in the Philippines.
RESTAURANTS: Visiting  the local Carinderias around the Philippines would give me a great idea of the most popular dishes in their region. Eating in Restaurants will also show me examples of how Chefs are innovating Filipino Cuisine in their own way.
SPECIFIC INGREDIENTS/ FLAVOURS - Varieties of Rice, Coconuts and their many uses, the utilization of Vinegar, Our Love for Sour flavours, Calamansi, The unlimited uses for Pork, 
INDIGENOUS FOOD: A lot of the indigenous tribes have inhabited The Philippines long before the Spanish era of colonization would like to learn more about the Aeta and the Ifugao to understand more about the history of their origins and the food that they have lived on for so long and their methods of preparation.
AGRICULTURE - FARMING, FISHING
COOKING METHODS & PRESERVING


   The Impact  By contributing, you are choosing to entrust me to become an ambassador for Filipino cuisine. As I embark on this incredible journey, I will do everything I can to record my experiences and knowledge gained to share with you.
How does this impact you and others? Whether Filipino or not, this culinary research expedition will be a leap in allowing me to pioneer contemporary Filipino Cuisine in London which brings us a step closer to making great Filipino food available to London and the British public. 
WHY CHOOSE ME?
Although young, I have the drive and ambition to spearhead Filipino Cuisine into the UK. Here is a summary of work and achievements so far.


7 Years professional experience as a Chef.
Launched pop-up restaurants serving contemporary Filipino cuisine under the brand ‘LeHappyChef’ which soon gained followers. I have successfully run 4 pop-up restaurants events since
Over 1000 Followers on Twitter
Over 1100 Followers on Instagram
Over 1400 Likes combined on two Facebook pages 
A Combined total of over 20,000 views on my Youtube Channel
Raised £1000 for ‘Bantay Bata 163’ by running a fine dining event which included a 5 course meal, live music and Filipino Cultural Dancers known as ‘Anahaw dance artists’.
Worked with other organizations within the ‘Filipino Food Movement’ such as ‘Next Day Better’ and ‘Maynila’
Co-Founded contemporary Filipino restaurant concept known as ‘LUZON’ and ran a 3 month pop-up restaurant in Russell Square 
Most recently, I was requested by the Philippine Department of Tourism (PDOT) to prepare, cook and serve canapes for up to 500 guests at the World Travel Market 2015 in London Excel.




RISKS & CONCERNS

Safety & Security - My trip will involve communication as well as commuting. I am partnering up with a close friend, Rina Atienza, who will tour the 3 months with me but she has advised that we tour as a “Crew” which should be a minimum of 3 or 4 people including myself and Rina. This creates a sense of security in numbers.
Budget - This project is quite ambitious as well as a long duration. The budget needs to be carefully broken down to cover all the necessary costs with extra funds for back up. The budget greatly affects all aspects of the project and will determine how much we can get done, what we can see, what we can spend on and how we can commute and document everything. We can reduce costs where possible but it would be a great deal of help to get assistance from others with discounts and accommodation.
Communication - While a lot of Filipinos speak and understand english the mother tongue Tagalog is more widely used. Unfortunately I do not speak Tagalog so i may find it difficult in trying to communicate and create relationships with others in the Philippines. However, I am trying my best to learn basic Tagalog and I will be assisted by friends to help me communicate.
Food Hygiene - Street food and Markets are commonly known to be more unhygienic due to less safer food preparation practices so I will have to be careful what I eat. 

   Other Ways You Can Help If you believe in this trip but can't contribute money, you can still help!  Please like the video, and share this crowd funding campaign with your friends and family to help spread awareness. You can do this with the indiegogo share tools provided!   Thank you for your time and consideration and I hope that you will contribute and support me in my effort to learn more about Filipino Cuisine and Culture to share with you.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>Simple, quality nutrition without compromising.</h2>
<p>Seven and a half years ago, a decision was made that would at the time seem so irrational, yet it would become one of the best decisions I have ever made. That decision was to adopt a puppy named Rue, who happened to be a bit of a problem child in the health department. I had personally been very sick at the time, having just turned 19 and diagnosed with a chronic, debilitating autoimmune disease while in my sophomore year of college. Rue had chronic food and environmental allergies, and the number of hours spent reading pet food labels, trying new brands that held empty promises, and vet visits that only pushed heavy medications, was simply absurd. I watched the dog that provided me with unconditional love despite my own downfalls struggle daily due to my inability to provide her with a food that fit her needs. One day, I stumbled into a community of like minded individuals, all experiencing the exact same issue. On that day, SoCo Raw was born, and while it took a solid 5 years, it has blossomed. And my sweet baby girl Rue is 7.5 years old and not just surviving anymore, she is thriving.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1572498062/vqf59oqnljq7dn1mifn5.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>After a year of business development, SoCo Raw officially began producing product in the small kitchen that resided in my boyfriend's and my personal home. The purpose of the company was simple: to provide complete and balanced raw diets, in which the ingredients were entirely sourced from local farms practicing the most ethical, humane and sustainable farming practices, that could be completely customized to fit each individual pet's needs, in addition to the pet owner's budget, needs, and time constraints. Our hope was to provide an affordable, convenient and customized raw product without all of the stress associated with properly balancing and ethically sourcing ingredients for each and every diet. This hope became reality within the first few weeks of accepting orders, and it has continued to grow each and every day as we fulfill orders and develop new exciting ideas on how to expand our product line and how to continue to provide the absolute best nutrition to as many pet's as we possibly can.</p>

<h3>How You Can Help</h3>
<p>Being fully transparent, I am a 26 year old single female, and I have been told very bluntly that due to these reasons, regardless of maintaining rock solid business and financial plans, exemplary sales history and book keeping, that I am too much of a risk to invest in or loan to. We were advised to look towards the people in our life who have loved and supported this company just as much as we have for support in reaching that next step in the growth of SoCo Raw, and in the growth of knowledge regarding pet nutrition, proper sourcing, and proper overall care for your pet.</p>
<p>This is where you wonderful individuals come in.</p>
<p>In order to achieve this goal, there are three primary elements that this funding is needed for:</p>
<ul>
<li>To cover initial rental and and construction costs for new facility and retail store front</li>
<li>The ability to purchase equipment that will fit the needs and the demands of the company now, as well as moving forward</li>
<li>To allow us to hire more wonderful staff to play a crucial role in expanding this company (as well as personally training and funding the Canine Nutrition certification courses for each employee)</li>

<p>At the end of the day, we are animal loving, scientifically driven, passionate individuals who are fully fed up with the lack of change in an industry that very well can and will either provide your pets with the fuel they need to live long, healthy, fruitful lives or they will riddle your pets with disease and cause the deaths of millions of pets worldwide every year. It is time for change. And if not now, then when? If not us, then who? The thing is that this change cannot just happen with one company or one individual, it will take a village. And our hope is to build that village with people so strong and so determined that the big box companies who produce toothpaste and candy, who dominate the pet food industry, will no longer exist in a field they are not qualified to be in - one that has lives on the line. We hope you too see that need for change, and that you are willing to help us achieve it together. </p>

<li>Reach out to us - we want to meet you, talk to you, and find a way for you to be a part of the SoCo family</li>
<li>Share our campaign - we cannot do this alone, getting the word out to as many animal lovers as possible will help more than anything!</li>
<li>If you are in the greater Houston area - we can use as many helping hands as possible, and if you are looking for an awesome animal loving company to work with, we may just know the perfect place for you ;)</li>

<p>Growing this company has been the absolute best ride of my life, and the greatest part is that it is just getting started.

<p>As a Nepal based project, we have gained vital support from a long-time supporter in Australia to assist in reaching a wider audience. This is why our campaign is in Australian Dollars.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Tara &amp; Nirdesh met through a mutual friend and instantly clicked with the idea of opening a café that sells the Nepali dish Mo Mo’s and of course coffee. We have created 15 unique home-made Mo Mo’s. On the surface the mission of the café is to provide healthy, homely food to the customers and serve organic Nepalese coffee in a living room concept café, but there was more to it…. </p>
<p>The café donates Rs. 5 per cup of coffee to educate those in the remote area of Upper Dolpo. (Approx. 350km N-W of Kathmandu on the Tibet Border).</p>
<p>Through many years of personally seeking out opportunity, we believe in empowering local youth and giving back to society. We give jobs and train those who have never worked before &amp; have little likelihood of employment. They gain work experience and the required hospitality skills. </p>
<p>Over the past 5-years we have created two cafés that operate in the bustling heart of Kathmandu, where we source all of our products locally, and profit share with the local people. Our wonderful hardworking people make all the difference. They have always been the heart and soul of our business.</p>
<p>All that is threatened due to Covid-19 and the closure of business. The Pandemic is only now gaining ground in Nepal. Prior to closure we supported 10 staffs and their families relying on staff wages.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Problem:</h3>
<p>In February, as COVID-19 started to spread, our business declined, mimicking what was happening to small businesses, like us, around the world. Now Government restrictions have forced our closure with no options to innovate our service i.e. via take-away meals etc. We understand that the pandemic is challenging even the most developed countries. However, with a Government struggling with a myriad of country-wide issues that sees no opportunity to save our business in the short term. Landlords will not give rent relief, nor Banks defer loan payments. The immediate reality is that we will be forced to close and forfeit our fit out. As a defaulting tenant the option to start up again is unlikely.    </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Currently, we are trying to raise funds that will give us the ability to service our current liabilities (rent and bank loan) and as a result sustain our business so that we can re-open once restrictions ease and no doubt in a stronger form with our existing staff still on-board. We created this campaign because we wanted something sustainable, created over many years. To close and see a close to the inspiring results we have achieved is heart breaking for more than just the two pioneers of the business. We want to see you as part of our future and created some perks to our fund supporters.</p>
<p>If we manage to raise our funds obviously, we survive, keep our staff and get to add our ideas to innovate the business that were planned for early 2020. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Since we opened the café we have been able to contribute to funding education in Upper Dolpo schools. We have trained our staff with skills and expertise which is very useful for them in the real world. Some of the staffs have been Tara's students from school who got the chance experience real life experience through providing them work in the cafe. Our main kitchen cook is Tara's former student who now has been with the company for 3 years. We feel overwhelmed to trained more than 20 kids to date and many of which have gone onto obtaining further employment.</p>
<p>We want to continue doing what we love and not make the money to be the real problem. In the past few years, we have planned, managed and built the business and the future looked bright. A lot of memories &amp; moments have been created for our customers (foreign and local) which are priceless. As the situation is uncertain and that we do not know when things will get back to normal, closer is anticipated. This is a last resort move given its longer implications on our ability to reopen, the loss of our vision and the many fond memories created that deserved building upon. Also, we have created a beautiful connection between patrons and staff through the cafe which wouldn't have been possible if it wasn't there. Wee are not giving up and trust you can support our plans.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
<p>Thank you all for being part of our growing community and joining hands<br/>together to support us through these difficult times. Invest in future experiences with <br/>MO: MO la Palpasa coffee and let’s get through these difficult times together. <br/>The times are tough, but our resolve is strong. It's completely okay if you cannot support us this time as we are aware that this is a global crisis, you could still help us by spreading the word and letting others know who could possibly be part of our community.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

 please click the link to get to know more about us. My Republica newspaper covered our story hearing about us through locals.


 
Problem:
In February, as COVID-19 started to spread, our business declined, mimicking what was happening to small businesses, like us, around the world. Now Government restrictions have forced our closure with no options to innovate our service i.e. via take-away meals etc. We understand that the pandemic is challenging even the most developed countries. However, with a Government struggling with a myriad of country-wide issues that sees no opportunity to save our business in the short term. Landlords will not give rent relief, nor Banks defer loan payments. The immediate reality is that we will be forced to close and forfeit our fit out. As a defaulting tenant the option to start up again is unlikely.    
 
What We Need & What You Get
Currently, we are trying to raise funds that will give us the ability to service our current liabilities (rent and bank loan) and as a result sustain our business so that we can re-open once restrictions ease and no doubt in a stronger form with our existing staff still on-board. We created this campaign because we wanted something sustainable, created over many years. To close and see a close to the inspiring results we have achieved is heart breaking for more than just the two pioneers of the business. We want to see you as part of our future and created some perks to our fund supporters.
If we manage to raise our funds obviously, we survive, keep our staff and get to add our ideas to innovate the business that were planned for early 2020. 
 

The Impact
Since we opened the café we have been able to contribute to funding education in Upper Dolpo schools. We have trained our staff with skills and expertise which is very useful for them in the real world. Some of the staffs have been Tara's students from school who got the chance experience real life experience through providing them work in the cafe. Our main kitchen cook is Tara's former student who now has been with the company for 3 years. We feel overwhelmed to trained more than 20 kids to date and many of which have gone onto obtaining further employment.
We want to continue doing what we love and not make the money to be the real problem. In the past few years, we have planned, managed and built the business and the future looked bright. A lot of memories & moments have been created for our customers (foreign and local) which are priceless. As the situation is uncertain and that we do not know when things will get back to normal, closer is anticipated. This is a last resort move given its longer implications on our ability to reopen, the loss of our vision and the many fond memories created that deserved building upon. Also, we have created a beautiful connection between patrons and staff through the cafe which wouldn't have been possible if it wasn't there. Wee are not giving up and trust you can support our plans.
 


Conclusion:
Thank you all for being part of our growing community and joining handstogether to support us through these difficult times. Invest in future experiences with MO: MO la Palpasa coffee and let’s get through these difficult times together. The times are tough, but our resolve is strong. It's completely okay if you cannot support us this time as we are aware that this is a global crisis, you could still help us by spreading the word and letting others know who could possibly be part of our community.
Thank you.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

Yet companies can be powerful engines of sustainable development. How? Keeping profit as the main objective, they can simultaneously create value and impact in the local community.</p>
<p>Adopting CSR requires time and a change of culture, especially in a country where the risk of corporate failure is very high (according to the Doing Business Report). However, companies can in the long term, go beyond its legal obligations and provide innovative solutions that produce social and environmental benefits.</p>
<p>Our ambition is to encourage companies to generate more impact, for both stakeholders and for themselves, by promoting dialogue and providing them with the necessary tool that foster the transition to action.</p>

<li>A tool for value creation and competitiveness improvement,</li>
<li>A response to stakeholder expectations,</li>
<li>A shared responsibility.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>But achieving Sustainable Development requires the Sharing of Responsibilities.</b></p>
<p>This is actually a shared responsibility between different stakeholders, namely the regulatory authorities, civil society, communities. In short, all the persons, entities and organizations whose needs and interests are linked to the company.</p>
<p>The Sustainable Development conference, June 16-17 2016</p>
<p>This platform aims to share that vision and encourages the transition to action.</p>

</div></div>","The Corporate Social Responsibility, a change lever. Let’s mobilize companies!The Sustainable Development event is more than a conference. This is a first step in a revolution that is changing the way companies run their business. The event will bring the business community, civil society, the public and the public sector together. It is a platform that will redefine the way people do and receive Social Responsibility.How are doing that?Our motto: Being a bridge between companies and communitiesCSR is a relatively new approach in Madagascar and businesses often lack the means to formalize a CSR policy. Yet companies can be powerful engines of sustainable development. How? Keeping profit as the main objective, they can simultaneously create value and impact in the local community.
Adopting CSR requires time and a change of culture, especially in a country where the risk of corporate failure is very high (according to the Doing Business Report). However, companies can in the long term, go beyond its legal obligations and provide innovative solutions that produce social and environmental benefits.
Our ambition is to encourage companies to generate more impact, for both stakeholders and for themselves, by promoting dialogue and providing them with the necessary tool that foster the transition to action.
CSR is a change lever. It is:

A business contribution to sustainable development,
A tool for value creation and competitiveness improvement,
A response to stakeholder expectations,
A shared responsibility.

But achieving Sustainable Development requires the Sharing of Responsibilities.
This is actually a shared responsibility between different stakeholders, namely the regulatory authorities, civil society, communities. In short, all the persons, entities and organizations whose needs and interests are linked to the company.
The Sustainable Development conference, June 16-17 2016
This platform aims to share that vision and encourages the transition to action.
By facilitating meetings between companies, stakeholders and the general public; the aim is to reflect on how stakeholders can play their full role in the development and success of social and environmental business initiatives; initiatives that will lead to Sustainable Economic and Community Development.
Our vision: Develop a serie of conferences on Sustainable Development for years to come and draw public attention to global challenges such as resource scarcity, climate change, CSR...
The agenda: workshops and conferences with CSR specialists and practitioners, an exhibition held by the different actors wishing to demonstrate their services and investment in sustainable development. The Fair is open to everyone: students, professionals, NGO…
Step
More than 12 companies met and contacted that will be part of the panelists. We will be working with governmental organizations and public entities and make this event an impactful event.
Support this event! It is an opportunity for sharing and mobilization of companies and their stakeholders to the cause of Sustainable Development.
Your support will:

Create a meeting and exchange opportunity between corporate-general public and civil society,
Develop an opportunity for sharing,
Establish a showcase of CSR initiatives and Sustainable Development,
Raise awareness in CSR issues and perspectives,
Expose companies to CSR solutions enabling them to take action,
Expose participants to CSR and Sustainable Development experiences from abroad and Madagascar based companies,

We can help us to find experts as well. This will substantially reduce our budget.

responsabilité sociale de l’entreprise, comme levier de changement. Mobilisons
les entreprises !Le
salon du développement durable est bien plus qu’une conférence. C’est une
première étape dans une révolution qui consiste à changer la façon dont les
entreprises gèrent leurs affaires. Le salon va rassembler le monde des
affaires, la société civile, le grand public et le secteur public. C’est une
plateforme qui va redéfinir la façon dont les gens font et perçoivent la
Responsabilité sociale de l’entreprise.
Comment?

Notre devise : Etre un pont entre les entreprises
et les communautés

La RSE
est une approche relativement nouvelle à Madagascar et les entreprises manquent
souvent de moyens nécessaires pour formaliser une politique RSE. Et pourtant,
les entreprises peuvent être de puissants moteurs de Développement Durable.
Comment ? En  gardant le profit
comme principal objectif, elles peuvent simultanément créer de la valeur et de
l’impact au niveau de la communauté locale. 
Nous
sommes conscients qu’adopter la RSE nécessite du temps et un changement de
culture, surtout dans un pays où les risques d’échec des entreprises sont très
élevés (Doing Business Report). Néanmoins,
les entreprises peuvent s’engager dans la durée, aller au-delà de ses
obligations légales et fournir des solutions innovantes produisant un bénéfice
social et environnemental.  
Notre ambition
est d’encourager les entreprises à générer plus d’impact, autant pour les
parties prenantes que pour elles-mêmes, en favorisant le dialogue et en mettant
à leur disposition les moyens informations nécessaires pour instrumenter le passage à
l’action. 
Pour nous la RSE est un levier de
changement qui est :


Une
contribution des entreprises au développement durable,


Un
outil de création de valeur et de compétitivité,


Une
réponse aux attentes des parties prenantes.


Mais l’atteinte du Développement Durable
passe par le Partage des Responsabilités. 
Il s’agit
en fait d’une Responsabilité Partagée entre différentes parties prenantes, à
savoir les autorités de régulation, la société civile, les communautés, bref
toutes les personnes, entités et organisations dont les attentes et les
intérêts sont liés à la compagnie.                                                                                  Le salon du Développement durable, 16-17 Juin 2016

<h3><b>The Impact</b></h3>
<p></p>
<div>We truly care about the impact that our business has upon our community's health and vitality. We have made every effort to not only buy locally, but also advertise and promote for the small farms and businesses we passionately support through direct customer sales and on all our media platforms. The financial risks we have taken by not going to large corporations for our supplies have only helped build trust, love, loyalty, and support from our customers and purveyors.</div>

</div><div>
<div>
<p>Getting the licensing for our alcoholic line will not come without its challenges, but many small companies have been more than successful, we are just as persistent and motivated...it will be done. We have built our company from the ground up, without the help of large investors or loans. That has not paved the smoothest road, but each success feels well earned.</p>
<p>There is often a delay or hiccup with reward expectations, but we have taken every step to ensure all rewards will be available and ready to send. <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">If there are any shipping issues or delays we will do our very best to efficiently remedy any unforeseen obstacles that may arise.</span></p>
<p>The spicy brew we make is filling a gap in the market that is screaming for ginger beer that actually tastes likes ginger, and this is what Timber City Ginger Beer is striving to do everyday. In the past two years our customer base has continued to grow and even depend on our products. This need alone will help our company motivate through any brewing, growing, logistical, or general life issues we may encounter; sometimes everything collides and creates the perfect storm and the strong always weather it with a smile, determination...and perhaps an occasional cocktail :)</p>

With these tools we will be able to become a legitimate force in the craft beverage world. Crowdfunding platforms like Indiegogo are the grand machines making success and funding attainable for independently driven folks like us!


We Need
~ The hoses, valves, and attachments that will make our fermentation tanks run smoothly and dispense like a charm~ 1 Hobart buffalo chopper for the processing of the pounds of fresh ginger we use in every brew~ And we REALLY need more kegs! An increase in production and distribution means that we need 40 new keg shells, in every size from 1/6 barrel to 1/2 barrel ~ Can size has been a hurdle for us, (our big 32 oz crowlers are a tricky retail sell), but we are now going to be able to produce enough to entice a mobile canning unit to come and visit ~ 1 glycol system which will enable us to keep all of the ginger beer in our tanks nice and chilly




The Impact

We truly care about the impact that our business has upon our community's health and vitality. We have made every effort to not only buy locally, but also advertise and promote for the small farms and businesses we passionately support through direct customer sales and on all our media platforms. The financial risks we have taken by not going to large corporations for our supplies have only helped build trust, love, loyalty, and support from our customers and purveyors.





Risks & Challenges


Getting the licensing for our alcoholic line will not come without its challenges, but many small companies have been more than successful, we are just as persistent and motivated...it will be done. We have built our company from the ground up, without the help of large investors or loans. That has not paved the smoothest road, but each success feels well earned.
There is often a delay or hiccup with reward expectations, but we have taken every step to ensure all rewards will be available and ready to send. If there are any shipping issues or delays we will do our very best to efficiently remedy any unforeseen obstacles that may arise.
The spicy brew we make is filling a gap in the market that is screaming for ginger beer that actually tastes likes ginger, and this is what Timber City Ginger Beer is striving to do everyday. In the past two years our customer base has continued to grow and even depend on our products. This need alone will help our company motivate through any brewing, growing, logistical, or general life issues we may encounter; sometimes everything collides and creates the perfect storm and the strong always weather it with a smile, determination...and perhaps an occasional cocktail :)

<blockquote>Hiking and dining in nature together with Garden of Sweden (2015)</blockquote>
</div><h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2><p>Our new nomadic work-style is an experiment. Every experiment has its challenges. These are ours:</p><p></p><ul>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><b>How can we be a company without a pshysical location or a steady physically reachable network? </b>Our concept solution for this is promoting this experiment via social media and digitally in our existing network. We create new connections and build new relationships online. From there we plan our new projects and travels. </span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><b>How do we live in a community setting when we originate from an individualised society?</b> Our concept solution for this question is to just force ourselves into a community setting by travelling as a pact. The last five months we have been living closely together seeing eachother and working together every day. We got used to living and working together, whitout a lot of personal space. This way we learned a lot of new knowledge about working and living together contructively as a community. The World Tour will teach us even more. As we will face more uncertanties together.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><b>What legal challenges do we face as a travelling company, changing locations and countries reguarly?</b> Our solution for this is taking it one step at the time. We have tried to unfold the legal structures for travelling and working. So far we cannot find our answers easilly. Part of this is the fact that the common protocols and systems cannot answer our questions and find solutions for our challenges. What we do is something new and has a lot of uncertanties. People working at legal or goverment facilities so far were not able to answer our questions, because they did not know how to work outside of the protocols.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><b>How do we connect and involve people that we meet and support in a more global setting, to help create the higher purpose that we seek?</b> It would be great if all the people we visit, support and capture can become connected to each other to keep supporting eachother to keep up the movement even when we are not there. We havent found a way to realise this. We need to experience and research first trough our travels. That way we can also ask our contacts about what they would want and requier to make this possible.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><b>How do we travel the world and keep a nomadic company on a low budget?</b> So far we havent specifically build up our savings. We are a start-up on a low budget. We have only made enough money to keep a low maintenance lifestyle going for the past couple of months. We will offer our services in exchange for what we need to stay alive and keep travelling. This campaign is also part of easing our experimental process.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><b>How do we (physically) reach ‘purpose’ driven people that wish to requier support and work together with our team?</b> As soon as we find the right people and projects we need to be able to physically reach them. We have no plan to always be able to achieve this. If we have enough money or the contact can pay for our travels, than this wont be a problem. If we don’t have enough money we will have to come up with more creative solutions or work for a while to save up.</span><br/>

Visit our website www.joyofworking.nl/english. What We Need & What You GetTradingWe are looking for (passion) projects where we exchange our active support as a team for accomodation, food and if possible money to be able to continue our work-style. You can find a list of our skills below.You can help us by opening up your network, to find more people and places to visit and support. We are willing to stay for a certain period of time to make things happen and contribute to something bigger than ourselves. Capturing the story of Mr. Bigsby (2015)To enlist yourself for a new project or destination please send an e-mail to: mail@joyofworking.nl. DonationsWe are raising €8000,-. This funding is a kickstarter for this World Tour. The amount of money is based on what you need to provide five people for three months (food, water, necessities). After three months we want to be able to rely on the work-style it self. We need these three months to experiment with: how to work and live in this new environment. We have several perks for you if you wish to make a donation to the World Tour. Some examples: 

Inspirational stories in high quality film; 


For Dutch people we have a brand new card game that improves creative thinking and is a lot of fun; 


We offer adventure, nature and bushcraft courses in Sweden. 

Check out this film of Mr. Bigsby (our treat ;)):https://vimeo.com/149986739By donating an amount of money you ease our experimental process. Visiting Masaaki Oyamada (2016)If there are any other ways you would like to support us with, please contact us at: mail@joyofworking.nlThe ImpactBesides the stories we create and the movement that we build, we have a lot to offer as a team.

Start With Why workshop for students (2016)
All the people in our team have finished at least one bachelor's study in college. We prefer to do a lot and have a positive impact on the world in a short amount of time. If you have faith in our abilities, we can do a lot more than mentioned. Our passion projectsThese are a couple of projects we loved working on in the past:

The 'Let's Start a Fire Festival': organising an accecible and affordable festival for all people to get inspired in active ways through more than 25 inspirational workshops and activities, executed by artists and creative entrepreneurs;


The 'A Journey Into The Unknown' documentary: a dream of making a documentary became reality when we made a documentary about personal development and got to know a lot of our current friends and aqcuaintances. 


The 'FCXL teacher team development project': melting two teams together in a fun and exciting way? We gave it a shot. One of the things we did is use a pubquiz format to give feedback about their team analysis. 


Start up support for 'Garden of Sweden': we still support our good friend Indiana with his startup company Garden of Sweden. We organize travel experiences for Dutch people to Sweden who want to work on their personal development and who want to broaden their horison. The trips focus on adventure, lifestyle and reconnecting with nature. 



Hiking and dining in nature together with Garden of Sweden (2015)
Risks & ChallengesOur new nomadic work-style is an experiment. Every experiment has its challenges. These are ours:

How can we be a company without a pshysical location or a steady physically reachable network? Our concept solution for this is promoting this experiment via social media and digitally in our existing network. We create new connections and build new relationships online. From there we plan our new projects and travels. 


How do we live in a community setting when we originate from an individualised society? Our concept solution for this question is to just force ourselves into a community setting by travelling as a pact. The last five months we have been living closely together seeing eachother and working together every day. We got used to living and working together, whitout a lot of personal space. This way we learned a lot of new knowledge about working and living together contructively as a community. The World Tour will teach us even more. As we will face more uncertanties together.


What legal challenges do we face as a travelling company, changing locations and countries reguarly? Our solution for this is taking it one step at the time. We have tried to unfold the legal structures for travelling and working. So far we cannot find our answers easilly. Part of this is the fact that the common protocols and systems cannot answer our questions and find solutions for our challenges. What we do is something new and has a lot of uncertanties. People working at legal or goverment facilities so far were not able to answer our questions, because they did not know how to work outside of the protocols.


How do we connect and involve people that we meet and support in a more global setting, to help create the higher purpose that we seek? It would be great if all the people we visit, support and capture can become connected to each other to keep supporting eachother to keep up the movement even when we are not there. We havent found a way to realise this. We need to experience and research first trough our travels. That way we can also ask our contacts about what they would want and requier to make this possible.


How do we travel the world and keep a nomadic company on a low budget? So far we havent specifically build up our savings. We are a start-up on a low budget. We have only made enough money to keep a low maintenance lifestyle going for the past couple of months. We will offer our services in exchange for what we need to stay alive and keep travelling. This campaign is also part of easing our experimental process.


How do we (physically) reach ‘purpose’ driven people that wish to requier support and work together with our team? As soon as we find the right people and projects we need to be able to physically reach them. We have no plan to always be able to achieve this. If we have enough money or the contact can pay for our travels, than this wont be a problem. If we don’t have enough money we will have to come up with more creative solutions or work for a while to save up.



Energising teachers with the power of music (2016)
The idea is that these questions can never really be figured out if we don’t just try them out. This is why we leave our lifes behind in search of answers and a large network of common purpose seekers. Join the movement if you want to work out the answers to these questions together. Other Ways You Can HelpWe love all the help we can get. If physically working with us, or donating money is not your thing, please contact us: mail@joyofworking.nl. We love to hear about your alternative ideas. Thank you for reading our story. Who knows: we might be seeing each other soon!",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Greetings from the Farm</h3>
<p>Reroot farm lives on 70 acres of paradise in Wellington County, Ontario, Canada, where we grow organic vegetables and raise pastured livestock. One of the first things you notice when you arrive at the farm is our 150-year-old heritage bank barn. <strong>Our barn provides winter housing for our cattle, sheep, pigs and hens, hay and straw storage, a place to park farm equipment and even a spot to cure the onions and garlic we grow in our market garden</strong>. The barn is not only a beautiful piece of rural heritage and architecture, but also a functional central part of our farm.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474249164/x27d6ovnygtkjagedrt1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Reroot Farm is celebrating it's tenth anniversary this year! That's 10 years of growing and raising healthy, happy food, feeding our community and training more young farmers to help grow the local, sustainable food movement.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>A Barn Worth Saving</h3>
<p>Our barn is a relic of a time when all farms were small, family-run, diversified operations. Sadly, over the past century, many of these beautiful bank barns – made from locally sourced stones and wood, crafted with hand-hewn beams and stone and mortar foundations – have been replaced by more specialized steel barns, or simply crumbled due to years of neglect.  </p>
<p>While our barn was in need of some repairs when it first became ours just over six years ago, <strong>the required repairs became urgent earlier this summer when a tractor we were using to put hay in the barn crashed through the floor</strong>, breaking boards and beams and crumbling the foundation along the bank wall.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474248896/wxb9agmgoli877a6hxjp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The rush is on to get these urgent repairs done before winter as we've been told <strong>if the frost gets behind the bank wall it will surely heave and buckle and cause the barn to fall taking with it not only a part of our livelihood but also a piece of rural heritage</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>We Need $20,000 to Save the Barn</h3>
<p>Farmers are by nature self-sufficient, resilient and stoic folk. It's hard for us to ask for help!</p>
<p>We've consulted with a local expert in bank barn restoration and have received estimates to repair the damage and correct other issues before the barn suffers more catastrophic damage. </p>
<p><strong>The labour and materials required to repair the foundation, replace the boards and beams, and reinforce the walls total approximately $20,000</strong>.</p>
<p>In addition to the daunting barn repairs, this season has been incredibly challenging:</p>
<ul>
<li>One of our greenhouses was destroyed, and another damaged in pre-tornado winds earlier this year</li>
<li>Our hay crop was poor due to lack of rain, forcing us to buy in hay to feed our animals this winter; and</li>
<li>The planting season has been fraught with troubles stemming from the season's drought, making it our worst growing season in 10 years.</li>
</ul>
<p>Being a small farm, we don't have a lot of expendable income. Everything we've made over the last 10 years has been reinvested back into the farm: a farm store in 2013, new greenhouses and farm equipment, and constant investment in the health of our soil.  </p>
<p>Needless to say, we could really use your support! We are reaching out to our broader community of friends, customers, local food lovers, history buffs and farm fans to help lighten our load.</p>

<h3>Become A Permanent Part of Rural Heritage</h3>
<p>We're not asking for a hand out: we have lots to offer in exchange and of course we'll sing your praises from the highest barn roof we can find!</p>
<p><strong>In exchange for your kind and generous support we will honour all donors on a donor wall in the barn once repairs are complete. </strong>This is your chance to become a permanent part of rural heritage.</p>

We're not asking for a hand out: we have lots to offer in exchange and of course we'll sing your praises from the highest barn roof we can find!
In exchange for your kind and generous support we will honour all donors on a donor wall in the barn once repairs are complete. This is your chance to become a permanent part of rural heritage.
We also have a number of great perks to offer including farm experiences and products, beautiful works of art featuring our heritage barn by our friend and talented artist Wesley Bates, and Reroot swag such as engraved walnut cutting boards and postcards featuring photos from around the farm.
 

The Impact
By supporting our Heritage Barn Restoration you will not only be helping to repair and restore a beautiful piece of history on our farm, you'll also be supporting a small, sustainable farm and the young farmers who make a living from and life on this farm.  

We hope to be growing and raising good food for many years to come here at Reroot and your support will enable us to do just that.

<p>It is no secret that Central Asia has been elusive from history books and encyclopedias. Members of our team sought education in developed cities as Moscow, London, and Melbourne, and experienced how little was known of our culture beyond borders. Besides, most of the people had no clue about where it is located. For us, Central Asia is home to history and earthy cultures, from its assortment of nomads in its territory. As patriotic Kyrgyz youth, we decided to promote our culture beyond borders, and propagate of its rich history and artifacts through our organization. Our handicrafts are a first hand story of our country, and many talented artists in remote villages have the product, but not the market. So putting these two factors together, ArtAsian aims to help these artists monetarily while promoting their art and Central Asian culture.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>What happens if we don't make our goal? Well, we will still use the money you give to make some of our purchases. Our first priorities are getting licensed and purchasing the brewing equipment. </p>
<p>Sometimes $30,000 seems like an overwhelming goal. Because, hey, it's a lot of money. However, when we talk about Panther Creek Brews with our friends, family, brew masters, community members, and government agencies, we receive so much excitement and reassurance that we're doing a great thing that $30,000 becomes a very real, attainable goal. </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We know that not everyone who would like to contribute money are able to. There are other ways that you can help:</p>
<p>Make some noise! Share this campaign with your friends, family, and networks. </p>
<p>Let us know about any connections you think would be good for us to make.</p>

What happens if we don't make our goal? Well, we will still use the money you give to make some of our purchases. Our first priorities are getting licensed and purchasing the brewing equipment. 
Sometimes $30,000 seems like an overwhelming goal. Because, hey, it's a lot of money. However, when we talk about Panther Creek Brews with our friends, family, brew masters, community members, and government agencies, we receive so much excitement and reassurance that we're doing a great thing that $30,000 becomes a very real, attainable goal. 

Other Ways You Can Help
We know that not everyone who would like to contribute money are able to. There are other ways that you can help:

</div></div>","Welcome to Trust Nanny.
And what exactly is Trust Nanny you
might ask?
It’s an on demand babysitting
service in the form of a smart phone app, where with the push of a button, a
certified, background checked and fully capable sitter will arrive at your home
in no time to take care of your loved ones.
(Customer Interface)


Much like other on demand services,
the service providers will be independent contractors who will form a
commercial partnership with Trust Nanny, one providing the service, the other,
the platform. Therefore nannies will determine their own schedules and working
hours.
(Nanny Interface)


Check out the survey we conducted where 36.3% of voters agree that at some point they would be interested in said services

Also, please feel free to access both customer and nanny wireframe interface so you can experience and get to know how the app will look like.

There are two ways to use Trust Nanny
and book a service

Schedule Nanny
Use this option when you want to
schedule a service for a determined date
State date and time for scheduled
appointment
State address for scheduled
appointment (map)
Choose time-lapse for set appointment



Choose care receivers (new or previously
saved)



State care receivers' special needs and schedules, if any

The
app will determine the number and type of nannies needed based on number of children,
age range, and special needs.
                                                                                                                                      Please keep in mind Trust Nanny's algorithm will always throw the most convenient (economic) result based on care receiver characteristics, always looking to client's  best interest. You can always upgrade experience (say 1 nanny per care receiver), but you can never downgrade service since we cannot expose quality and care receiver safety.
The app will also determine the
type of nanny needed 
There are three types of nannies
Basic: less than 2 years’ experience; can take care of children 4 years old and up.
Professional: more than 2 years’ experience; can take care of new
born babies and up.
Medical:
more
than 2 years’ experience; can take care of anyone (including special needs and
adults) (has nursing experience)

Note: all Trust Nanny Babysitters are certified in CPR/first aid training.


                        
In this case, a Basic Nanny is more than enough to take care of provided care receivers, but as we explained earlier, you can upgrade for a higher fee.



                         In this case, only professional and medical are available (perhaps a new born is involved in the mix)You
will be provided with a list of all nannies that meet the minimum requirements
for said care receiver(s). 
   

User
can look at nanny’s profile (personal info, experience, screening results, user
ratings, CPR/first aid certificates)



User must choose which nanny or
nannies to send invitation to. 
User may send invitation to many
nannies, or can look up for a specific nanny
Scheduling sends push notifications to the selected
nannies, whichever responds first will be confirmed to perform the service on the
established date.





Urgent Nanny
Use this option when an emergency
arises and you need the service ASAP
State address for scheduled
appointment (map)
Choose care receivers (new or previously
saved)


You will be provided with a list of
all online (immediately
available) nannies that meet the minimum requirements for said care
receiver(s). They will be sorted by ETA.


(from this point on, process is fairly similar to Schedule Nanny)


User may send invitation to many
nannies.
This sends push notifications to
the selected nannies; whoever responds first will be confirmed to perform the
service and must be on user doorstep as soon as possible (as stated by their
ETA)





Actual Appointment
A nanny from Trust Nanny should
appear on your doorstep at the precise time you requested. Nannies must
identify themselves.

At

events you should know of, and leave the premises.
The total cost of service will appear on screen, where it will be automatically deducted to your previously provided credit card


A small survey will appear in your app where you’ll rate your nanny according to service satisfaction



Screening process
Needless to say, the Nanny screening
process will be hard and arduous, it will consist of:



 ON LINE INTERVIEW


 PSYCHOLOGICAL TEST


RESUME
CHECK


DRUG TEST


BACKGROUND CHECK


CPR and FirstAid
Certification

<h3>Heavy Metal Playground and Making a Difference </h3>
<p>Hi! My name is Mark Stevanus and I am owner and operator of Heavy Metal Playground. Heavy Metal Playground is unique place where people can come and do something they have always want to do...play on heavy equipment! We launched this business as an entertainment venue but found out that there was so much more that we could to do to help people and give back to the community. Partnering with local educational institutes, we have developed certified training classes for heavy equipment. This is a much needed opportunity for people that want to learn a skill and have a better chance of getting a job. And with your help, we will be able to put people through classes to give them that chance. </p>
<p>By contributing to our cause we will be able to use the funds to broaden our reach to individuals, provide training and skills and give them an opportunity to pursue a career in the construction field. Many people cannot afford college or continuing education classes and we want to help these motivated individuals. A career in the construction field is a growing need. We can help better the chances of job placements for many people.</p>
<p>We also will be working with local groups and non-profits to find the right individuals that need a chance to succeed.</p>
<p><strong>What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We developed some fun perks including shout outs, t-shirts, Heavy Metal Playground coffee and kick butt party at our Playground. Plus you can contribute to pay for motivated individuals to become certified in heavy equipment training.</p>
<p><strong>If We Do or Don't Reach Our Goal</strong></p>
<p>All funds, whether we reach or goal or not, will be used for class and materials, marketing and to pay for students to become certified in heavy equipment training. We want to pay for all expenses for as many people as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Please Help Any Way You Can</strong></p>
<p>Any amount of funding will make a difference but you can also help by getting the word out about our campaign. Please share any way you can!</p>

<p>I’m Israa Hilles. I am Palestinian, but I was born and raised in the United Arab Emirates. At the age of 18, my family and I returned home. There, I witnessed three consecutive wars. I experienced unimaginable terrifying moments, yet I was luckier than many others as I worked for the USAID. This provided me with the opportunity to join a US international training program for entrepreneurship. Lucky me!</p>
<p>A year after my arrival to Montreal with no luck in finding a job, I decided to follow most of the new immigrants path. I followed my passion and started working on an idea for developing a co-working space that is affordable and accessible for other freelancers like me who struggle to find a space that they can call ‘office’! I’m proud to say that because of this space idea, I won two competitions; the first one <i>Osentreprende</i> Quebec, and the second competition is the entrepreneur of the year 2018 across Canada.</p>
<p>My mission in creating such a space aims at bringing a community of entrepreneurs together through networking, communication and collaboration. Without family here in Montreal and young woman, single and without a strong knowledge of the French language, I’m so proud to say that in one year, I have created a great space.</p>
<p>The main challenge I have now is to move my business to the next level. I would like to enhance my marketing strategies, hire one new staff and create a new product to add event hosting to my services. I need about $60,000 to make that possible.</p>
<p>Your generous support will help me to move forward with this mission to ensure the greatest community impact and contribution.</p>

<h3>OSO COFFEE CO.</h3>
<p>OSO Coffee Co. is a new coffee shop that is so close to officially opening it's doors in Houston's East End, aka 2nd Ward or Eado. This area of town is on the immediate East side of Downtown.  We began build out in the Summer of 2019 and have completed about 85% of build out and construction.</p>
<p>We had hoped to be completed and ready to open our doors by the Fall of 2020, but Covid-19 put a halt to a lot of shop progress and funding.  This Indiegogo Campaign, is our effort to make up for the remaining funding, asking friends, family, and the community for any help or donations.  Donations will help OSO with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Final build out of prep-kitchen and other minor repairs to the house</li>
<li>Kitchen plumbing &amp; grease trap installation</li>
<li>Kitchen fixtures, 3 compartment sink, hand wash sink</li>
<li>Commercial Fridge and Ice machine</li>
<li>Misc Kitchen equipment</li>
<li>Misc shop furniture, i.e. custom bar height table &amp; chairs, retail fixtures, custom patio furniture / lounge furniture</li>
<li>(2) Commercial Espresso Grinders.  Mahlkonig K30 grinder</li>
<li>(1) Commercial batch grinder.  Mahlkonig EK43</li>
<li>(1) Commercial Dual Coffee Brewer.  Fetco CBS-2132 XTS Twin</li>
<li>2 Group Espresso Machine (La Marzocco Linea PB, Victoria White Eagle, or La Marzocco GB5)</li>
<li>3 - 4 months of operating capital</li>
<li>Various occupancy &amp; city permits</li>
</ul>
<p>OSO Coffee Co. is located at 2603 Navigation in Houston. The shop's founder, Hector Garcia, named the shop after his mom, Yolanda, who's nickname is ""Oso"".  Oso means ""bear"" or ""mama bear"" in Spanish. As the oldest of 4 sisters, she helped raise them all, and this shop is being built in her honor.  Yolanda turns 82 years old October 31st, 2020 and we plan on revealing the shop to her before this date.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>WHAT DOES ""OSO"" MEAN?</h3>
<p>""OSO"" is the Spanish word for ""bear"" or in this case ""mama bear"".  It's the nickname of the Founder's mother, Maria Yolanda Garcia, who will be celebrate her 82nd birthday on October 31, 2020.  Yolanda is the oldest of 11 brothers and sisters and has always been the matriarch of the family.  She was forced to become the ""mama bear"" at an early age, to care and watch over her baby sisters and brothers after their mother left them with an aunt.</p>
<p>To this day, her nickname has been ""Oso"" and this coffee shop is built in her honor.  She isn't aware of the shop yet and our plan is to surprise her with a shop reveal before her October 31st birthday.  Pics and video of that reveal will come soon.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>HOW MUCH DOES OSO NEED?</h3>
<p>Our fundraising goal for this campaign is $60,000. </p>
<p>This is a conservative number, but it helps cover everything listed above and gives us a little ""cushion"" for the first 2 months of operation. </p>
<p>Our largest perk is set at $5,000 and if you'd like to contribute more than that, please contact us and we can discuss and provide more information. </p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>THE PERKS</h3>
<p>We have created a variety of perks that reward a wide range of donation amounts.  Whether you donate $25 or $500, you will see that each perk has been carefully curated to represent your donation amount. </p>
<p>Note that the OSO perks are not ""equal trades"" for each dollar amount, but we show our appreciation by providing more collateral as the donation amounts increase.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>SPONSOR SPECIFIC ITEMS</h3>
<p>In addition to OSO Perks, we have provided a few items in the list as specific pieces of equipment that you can sponsor.  For example, if you'd like to provide the funds needed to purchase one of the grinders or brewers on our list, you can choose that option in our list of perks. </p>
<p>We won't have every item listed as a ""sponsorship"" item, but if you'd like to know what other specific needs we have, please contact us at info@oso.coffee.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>OSO'S IMPACT TO THE COMMUNITY</h3>
<p>Though we are not officially open for business, we have been hosting weekend ""pop ups"" on either Saturday or Sunday from 9am - 1pm.  These popups have allowed us to meet our neighbors, build some hype, and give visitors a sneak peak of the shop.  Every popup is packed and we can already see how busy and popular OSO Coffee shop will be. </p>
<p>OSO will be the only coffee shop on Navigation Blvd, which is a several mile stretch of high traffic road between Downtown and the Ship Channel.  The shop is surrounded by a variety of restaurants and a booming neighborhood, which contribute to OSO's traffic on the weekends. There is also a Sunday morning farmers market that takes place in the Navigation esplanade, across the street from OSO, that contributes to our shop traffic.  New home develop is constantly growing and new businesses are rising up along Navigation Blvd.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>GIVING BACK</h3>
<p>OSO Coffee will stand out as a business that will always be giving back to the community and we'll do that through two of our biggest loves:  dogs &amp; bikes. </p>
<p>With the owner being the creator of two of Houston's largest and longest running dog festivals, DogPop and Puppies for Breakfast, OSO will continually use a portion of profits to give back to dog rescue and help homeless dogs in the various Wards that surround the shop. </p>
<p>We also have a passion for cycling and anything bike friendly, so we hope to serve as a hub for the cycling community.  We will also give back to youth in the greater downtown area through our very own bike charity movement called The Byke Project, which started in 2000 and continues to date.  Through this project we provide free bike repair and new bikes to those less fortunate. </p>
<p>With this said, know that your donation will go to a business that will go above and beyond simply providing food and drinks to the neighborhood.</p>

<h3>ABOUT THE FOUNDER</h3>
<p>Hector Garcia is a Houston native and has been an active member of the community for over 25 years.  Through his love for people, animals, and cycling, Hector has always looked for ways to give back to the city through the things that he loves.  He continues to do that today and is now adding coffee to his list of passions.</p>
<p>Hector developed his passion for coffee after being surrounded by other enthusiasts, roasters, baristas, and other coffee shop owners.  He immersed himself into the industry several years ago and in the process of working on a bike shop / coffee concept, he discovered the little bungalow on Navigation Blvd.  This little space birthed the idea for OSO Coffee and Hector still has future plans to launch the BykeShop Coffee concept.</p>
<p>As mentioned, Hector has worked to give back to this city that he loves through his passions and he's created a variety of memorable brands and events in the process.  Below are a list of accomplishments and passion projects:</p>
<p><strong>PUPPIES FOR BREAKFAST: </strong> Houston's largest and longest running dog festivals, created in 2010.  Will celebrate 10 years in the Spring of 2021. </p>
<p><strong>DOGPOP: </strong> the little brother dog fest to Puppies for Breakfast.  DogPop has quickly grown to be Houston's second largest dog festival, each giving back to dog rescue and dog charities in Houston.</p>
<p><strong>HTX BIKE FEST:</strong>  Houston's only bicycle festival, created in 2012 with cycling partner Cisco Nira.  This bike fest has been the city's largest bicycle festival, making its run from 2012 - 2016.  This event was designed and created to bring the cycling community together and give back through the industry.</p>
<p><strong>THE BYKE PROJECT: </strong> In 2000, Hector and friends created this charitable project as a way to give back to low income areas of the city through free bike repair and new bike donations.  The project continues to date and OSO coffee will give back through this project once officially open.</p>

We started as a pop-up with 3 sweat-equitors, and grew over 10 years into a 3-location operation, employing around 35 people. We also thrive on local partnership. Wakin' Bakin' uses as much local product as we can get our hands on (from the honey &amp; produce farmer, to the local tofu artisan), and use locally-owned purveyors for the rest.  We always call the neighborhood guys for maintenance and repairs, and trade with the corner mechanic to keep operations running. We believe in supporting the roots of commerce and maximizing the resources at hand. </p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">We’re fortunate to have the support of a dedicated network of management and long-term employees who deserve a piece of the pie. They’ve carried us through some of our hardest times, and we want to support that merit with a tangible investment that they can grow with. We value our team's time, and strive to nurture their strengths. This like minded team values healthy and progressive quality-of-life standards for the oft under-appreciated service-industry professional, and we want to fuel that fire. </p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Your support means opportunity to a New Orleans service professional. Our industry's backbone tends to suffer a stressful and thankless career, often left without opportunity for growth or support in times of hardship. We do our best to support our people on a case-by case basis, but in an industry with notoriously tight margins we know that a savvy investment in their health and stability is key to strengthening our workforce.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""> When the time comes, we plan to support future campaigns to sponsor the ownership of the individuals eligible for buy-in. </p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""> </p><h3><i>Risks &amp; Challenges</i></h3><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">While opening our new location in 2018, we were faced with about $70k in unforeseen challenges, such as having to replace the entirety of a promised-functional kitchen, expensive broken pipes under the building (despite appropriate inspections!), a storage shed collapse due to termite damage, one brick thru the window (complete with missing safe), and a fair amount of heartache to follow.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">As a husband &amp; wife team with 3 restaurants and two toddlers, we’ve relied heavily on this team that has supported us tirelessly through all of the pits and valleys. There's no price tag on this level of dedication, as it can really only measure up to the manic passion of entrepreneurship. We've carried ourselves so far with so little that we know Wakin' Bakin's opportunities are endless with this talented and eclectic team, and a touch of your support. </p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1581738957/f7oulmiwdfmx2nwzr9cj.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3><i>Other Ways You Can Help</i></h3><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">We appreciate more than just monetary support!

While we can continue to sustain our incredibly aggressive plan to pay off debt from 2018's expansion ( back to debt free within the next year! ), with your support we could simultaneously get the legal leg-work started on our ownership offerings.  The closer we get to our goals, the more we can pursue other efforts to increase our employee-support capabilities. The ImpactWakin’ Bakin’ has grown tremendously as a local, family-owned operation. We started as a pop-up with 3 sweat-equitors, and grew over 10 years into a 3-location operation, employing around 35 people. We also thrive on local partnership. Wakin' Bakin' uses as much local product as we can get our hands on (from the honey & produce farmer, to the local tofu artisan), and use locally-owned purveyors for the rest.  We always call the neighborhood guys for maintenance and repairs, and trade with the corner mechanic to keep operations running. We believe in supporting the roots of commerce and maximizing the resources at hand. We’re fortunate to have the support of a dedicated network of management and long-term employees who deserve a piece of the pie. They’ve carried us through some of our hardest times, and we want to support that merit with a tangible investment that they can grow with. We value our team's time, and strive to nurture their strengths. This like minded team values healthy and progressive quality-of-life standards for the oft under-appreciated service-industry professional, and we want to fuel that fire. Your support means opportunity to a New Orleans service professional. Our industry's backbone tends to suffer a stressful and thankless career, often left without opportunity for growth or support in times of hardship. We do our best to support our people on a case-by case basis, but in an industry with notoriously tight margins we know that a savvy investment in their health and stability is key to strengthening our workforce. When the time comes, we plan to support future campaigns to sponsor the ownership of the individuals eligible for buy-in.  Risks & ChallengesWhile opening our new location in 2018, we were faced with about $70k in unforeseen challenges, such as having to replace the entirety of a promised-functional kitchen, expensive broken pipes under the building (despite appropriate inspections!), a storage shed collapse due to termite damage, one brick thru the window (complete with missing safe), and a fair amount of heartache to follow.As a husband & wife team with 3 restaurants and two toddlers, we’ve relied heavily on this team that has supported us tirelessly through all of the pits and valleys. There's no price tag on this level of dedication, as it can really only measure up to the manic passion of entrepreneurship. We've carried ourselves so far with so little that we know Wakin' Bakin's opportunities are endless with this talented and eclectic team, and a touch of your support. Other Ways You Can HelpWe appreciate more than just monetary support! The time you’ve taken out of your day to read about Wakin’ Bakin’ and its hopes and dreams wasn’t for nothing. Please share!Maybe you know someone who plans to visit New Orleans soon? Or someone who just enjoys punny word-play and the local workaholic? The more people we reach, the better chance we stand to reach our goal! If you're in the neighborhood, we welcome you to dine in our restaurants, pick-up some merch, and let the team know you’re rooting for ‘em!Follow us on Facebook https://www.facebook.com/WakinBakinNOLA/Instagram https://www.instagram.com/wakinbakin/ and Twitter https://twitter.com/WakinBakinNOLA",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

Rich in vitamin E and antioxidants, it protects against the visible signs of aging. Saponins and triterpenoids in argan oil promote healing and hydration, and the unsaturated fatty acids omega-9 (oleic acid) and omega-6 (linoleic acid) help improve the condition of your skin and hair, and the sterolins support cell turnover and help retain moisture.  Avocado oil is absorbed by the deep layers of the skin and because of its ability to retain water, it acts as an emollient, promoting soft and supple skin. The sterolins help produce more skin collagen and reduce age spots.  Sesame Oil is nutrient rich, containing Vitamins E, K, B6, as well as phosphorus, copper, calcium, zinc, magnesium, omega-3 and phytosterol.

<div>     About a year ago we purchased an 87 acre parcel of land to start our dream farm on.  We intended to build a small homestead for the function of providing for ourselves, but it didn't take long to take on bigger dreams of a legitimate farm that provides for the community, not just ourselves.  We sunk all our savings and even cashed out our retirement to start the infrastructure of the farm.  We have accomplished a lot in a year.  But we have so much more we want to do!  </div>
<div>     Here at Olde Haven Farm, we believe in knowing where our food comes from.  We believe that our animals deserve a happy healthy life with the ability to do what comes natural to them.  Chickens forage for bugs in the fields.  Sheep graze on lush green pastures with the goats near by.  Ducks have access to ponds any time they want.  We also believe in using the resources that our land provides for us, and being good stewards of our land.  We do not want to destroy the land but build it up, improving soil, trees, and fields.  We practice rotational grazing to allow land to recover from animals and to provide the animals with the best grazing and nutrition available.  <br/>
</div><div><br/></div>
<h3>Why you should care</h3><div><p>The number of farmers in America keeps declining and the farmers that are left are getting older.  The average age for a farmer in the US is 58.3 (2012 Census statistics).  That number has continually risen over the past 30 years.  While it may seem like farming is trendy right now, the statistics show that the number of new farmers dropped 20% from 2007.  It’s not clear what contributes most to the lack of younger farmers.  Perhaps it’s the notion of hard work that scares people, or how difficult it seems to be to make a profit off a farm, or maybe it has more to do with the big farming corporations that exist today.  But unless younger people get involved in farming, we risk losing farms all together.  </p></div>
<h3><b>Project Hay </b></h3>
<div>     We have a hay shortage in our area right now.  People just can't find the hay they need.  Suppliers and farmers alike are sold out of what they can provide to others.  And hay is such a vital resource to any farmer with animals.  We have heard many stories of farmers having to downsize herds simply because they cannot find the hay they need to get through the winter months.  <br/>
</div>
<div>     Our plan all along has been to do our own haying.  We have purchased all the equipment we need.  Right now we have just been cutting a smaller front field.  But we have dreams of getting a larger 20 acre hayfield in the our back field up and running. </div>
<div>     This is a picture of our back field right now:</div>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1450111429/sh0qyxd2jqwilrpfke1v.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>
<div>     It needs to be destumped (which will require renting an excavator and/or bulldozer) and cleaned up, then plowed, fertilized and seeded to create a 20 acre field that we can hay.  The hay field is our top priority right now so we can provide hay for our animals during the winter months as well as provide hay for the community.  </div>
<div>          Costs:</div>
<div>                         Equipment Rental/Fuel Costs  $3000</div>
<div>                         Manure  $2000</div>
<div>                         Lime  $3000</div>
<div>                         Seed $4000</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>Project Raise The Barn</h3>
<div>     We have slowly been building a new barn to house animals and store hay.  This is exactly where we are at right now:</div>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1450113548/ucupw2hzsmxqnwdl2kan.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>     The roof is on, and we have started the framing on the back.</div>
<div>     We want to be very honest about this, we do already have a bunch of the materials for the framing and we plan on siding with wood cut and milled from our own lot.  So while we still need to do a lot of work, a lot of the materials are already taken care of.   But things add up so fast, here's what we still need to finish the barn:</div>
<div>         Costs:</div>
<div>                        Screws &amp; Hardware  $1000</div>
<div>                        Additional framing materials  $1000</div>
<div>                        Gravel   $1000</div><div>                        Equipment Rental (for grading)  $500</div>
<div>                        A Helping Hand     priceless.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>Project Paddocks A'Plenty</h3>
<div>     Here at Olde Haven Farm we believe in rotational grazing.  We have sheep and goats in one fenced in paddock for a time, then before the paddock gets overgrazed we move them to the next paddock.  We'd like to add at least 3 more fenced in paddocks for our sheep and goats.  </div>
<div>     An example of our current paddocks:</div>
<div>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1450112787/sakz6t4uoytfqrqboxs0.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div>
<div>And this is an area that we would like to create paddocks in:</div>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1450112814/moy3ej6uupzxfeuovsda.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>
<div>Simple as that.</div>
<div>          Costs:</div>
<div>                        Fence Posts $1500</div>
<div>                        Field Fencing  $2000</div>
<div>                        Gates (4)  $600</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>Project Hog Alley</h3>
<div>     We've already talked about how we like rotational grazing, well it's even more important for us with our pigs.  We raise our pigs in a wooded part of our land.  We have paddocks to rotate the pigs through because pigs can be wonderful for the ground, but let's face it, they can also do a lot of damage if kept too long in one area.  </div>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1450114193/iarf80hbpbeequjev4vx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

</div>
<div>     We want to have a path that that goes pretty far back that is just lined with pig paddocks on each side of it.  We've got a few already, but we are hoping for at least 10 more paddocks!  That may sound like a lot, but like I said, pigs can do damage if they stay in the same place too long.  Plus we have noticed that they love being able to explore new areas.  </div>
<div>
<p>        Costs:</p>

<h3>Who should contribute</h3>
<div>     We want people to contribute to this campaign because they are passionate about farms or our personal farm values.  We want to reach those people who can be excited about providing more space for sheep grazing, who love hearing of chickens that run all over the farm instead of being cooped up in small spaces, and who enjoy hearing of farmers who value the land and the soil as much as the animals.  You can be a part of this farm, even if you never step foot on it.  But for some, you just want to support our family, and we thank you for that as well (even if you think we may be a little crazy).  We are dreaming big, and you can be a part of that.  Thank you!  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3></div>
<div>     If you cannot give money at this time, there are other ways to help out!  If you are local, we have many jobs around the farm you could give us a helping hand with.  But if you are not local, there is one important way you can help: you can help spread the news of this campaign.  Tell your friends who may be interested.  Share the link on Facebook.  I cannot even express how thankful we are for you sharing about our farm.  That is what is going to get the farm up and running.  </div>

<div><br/></div></div>","About Us
     About a year ago we purchased an 87 acre parcel of land to start our dream farm on.  We intended to build a small homestead for the function of providing for ourselves, but it didn't take long to take on bigger dreams of a legitimate farm that provides for the community, not just ourselves.  We sunk all our savings and even cashed out our retirement to start the infrastructure of the farm.  We have accomplished a lot in a year.  But we have so much more we want to do!  
     Here at Olde Haven Farm, we believe in knowing where our food comes from.  We believe that our animals deserve a happy healthy life with the ability to do what comes natural to them.  Chickens forage for bugs in the fields.  Sheep graze on lush green pastures with the goats near by.  Ducks have access to ponds any time they want.  We also believe in using the resources that our land provides for us, and being good stewards of our land.  We do not want to destroy the land but build it up, improving soil, trees, and fields.  We practice rotational grazing to allow land to recover from animals and to provide the animals with the best grazing and nutrition available.  

Why you should careThe number of farmers in America keeps declining and the farmers that are left are getting older.  The average age for a farmer in the US is 58.3 (2012 Census statistics).  That number has continually risen over the past 30 years.  While it may seem like farming is trendy right now, the statistics show that the number of new farmers dropped 20% from 2007.  It’s not clear what contributes most to the lack of younger farmers.  Perhaps it’s the notion of hard work that scares people, or how difficult it seems to be to make a profit off a farm, or maybe it has more to do with the big farming corporations that exist today.  But unless younger people get involved in farming, we risk losing farms all together.  
Project Hay 
     We have a hay shortage in our area right now.  People just can't find the hay they need.  Suppliers and farmers alike are sold out of what they can provide to others.  And hay is such a vital resource to any farmer with animals.  We have heard many stories of farmers having to downsize herds simply because they cannot find the hay they need to get through the winter months.  

     Our plan all along has been to do our own haying.  We have purchased all the equipment we need.  Right now we have just been cutting a smaller front field.  But we have dreams of getting a larger 20 acre hayfield in the our back field up and running. 
     This is a picture of our back field right now:

     It needs to be destumped (which will require renting an excavator and/or bulldozer) and cleaned up, then plowed, fertilized and seeded to create a 20 acre field that we can hay.  The hay field is our top priority right now so we can provide hay for our animals during the winter months as well as provide hay for the community.  
          Costs:
                         Equipment Rental/Fuel Costs  $3000
                         Manure  $2000
                         Lime  $3000
                         Seed $4000

Project Raise The Barn
     We have slowly been building a new barn to house animals and store hay.  This is exactly where we are at right now:

     The roof is on, and we have started the framing on the back.
     We want to be very honest about this, we do already have a bunch of the materials for the framing and we plan on siding with wood cut and milled from our own lot.  So while we still need to do a lot of work, a lot of the materials are already taken care of.   But things add up so fast, here's what we still need to finish the barn:
         Costs:
                        Screws & Hardware  $1000
                        Additional framing materials  $1000
                        Gravel   $1000                        Equipment Rental (for grading)  $500
                        A Helping Hand     priceless.

Project Paddocks A'Plenty
     Here at Olde Haven Farm we believe in rotational grazing.  We have sheep and goats in one fenced in paddock for a time, then before the paddock gets overgrazed we move them to the next paddock.  We'd like to add at least 3 more fenced in paddocks for our sheep and goats.  
     An example of our current paddocks:




And this is an area that we would like to create paddocks in:

Simple as that.
          Costs:
                        Fence Posts $1500
                        Field Fencing  $2000
                        Gates (4)  $600

Project Hog Alley
     We've already talked about how we like rotational grazing, well it's even more important for us with our pigs.  We raise our pigs in a wooded part of our land.  We have paddocks to rotate the pigs through because pigs can be wonderful for the ground, but let's face it, they can also do a lot of damage if kept too long in one area.  




     We want to have a path that that goes pretty far back that is just lined with pig paddocks on each side of it.  We've got a few already, but we are hoping for at least 10 more paddocks!  That may sound like a lot, but like I said, pigs can do damage if they stay in the same place too long.  Plus we have noticed that they love being able to explore new areas.  

        Costs:
                        Fence Posts  $2000
                        Wire  $400
                        Insulators  $1000
                        Gates (11)  $1100
                        Shelter Hardware & Roofing  $1600

bringing a brand new craft beer destination to Bethesda, Maryland. We’ll brew
the Washington DC region’s best beer and serve it in an open, communal, tap
room meant for long stays shared with great company.</p>
<p>This project is ambitious; we know
that. Bethesda is expensive, urban, and relatively unfamiliar with the destination
brewery and tap room concept. However, it's also wealthy, densely populated,
and nearly barren of delicious, local craft beer. We see an opportunity to
become the beating heart of a newly burgeoning craft beer scene in Bethesda and
throughout the Washington D.C. region.</p>
<p><b>What We Need</b></p>
<p>We are humbly asking you to help us achieve
our crowdfunding goal of $225,000 so that we may reach the Small Business
Administration's liquid cash requirement for loan approval.</p>
<p>The SBA has required that we show
proof of possessing 30% of our entire project's projected capital costs in
liquid cash before we may be approved for an SBA loan to fund the remainder of
the project. We are currently $225,000 short of reaching that critical
goal. Once we've acquired enough cash and the SBA has decided to approve
us for the loan, the project will move full steam ahead.</p>
<p>It is important for you to
understand that we, the founders, will be personally guaranteeing 100% of that
True Respite loan. We are quite literally putting every single dime we have and
every asset we own on the line to acquire this loan. We believe in this
business and we believe in ourselves.</p>
<p>Please help us finally make our
dream come true as we bring the people of Bethesda, Maryland, the destination
brewery and tap room they deserve.</p>
<p><b>What You Get</b></p>
<p>In addition to our sincerest
gratitude, we are honored to reward cash contributors with the following:</p>

<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>You could be our hero; our legend,
even. This could be your legacy. This is that big. Today, our business plan,
some legal documents, and a pretty neat logo and crest are all we have to show
for the past year and a half of endless hard work and thousands of dollars spent.
But with your help, we could be breaking ground on an iconic destination
brewery in very short order.</p>
<p>This isn't just for us, though.
Sure, it's our dream. It's our passion. It's our raison d'être. But this is
also for our customers. Bethesda, Maryland's only brewery is a small setup
inside the Rock Bottom restaurant located in town. For those unfamiliar, Rock
Bottom is a national restaurant and brewpub chain owned under the same
corporate parent as the Gordon Biersch brewpubs, the Denver ChopHouse, the
Walnut Brewery, and that neat little brewpub at the Boardwalk hotel in Disney
World. Although they make pretty good beer, the business is hardly local and
certainly not unique.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, craft beer is growing by
leaps and bounds all across America. Denver, Colorado, alone has over 90
breweries and is still growing. Yet despite its meteoric growth nationwide,
Bethesda, Maryland, a city with over 450,000 people living within just 5 miles
of its central downtown area, has somehow managed to play host to one single
brewery stuck inside a national restaurant and brewpub chain. That's it. This,
in the city ranked the #1 most educated place in America by Forbes and the top
earning town in America by Time in 2014 alone.</p>
<p>It's not a coincidence.</p>
<p>Montgomery County, the county in
which Bethesda resides, previously prohibited the sale of beer from producers
to on-premise customers and off-premise retailers. That all changed in July of
2014 when a new law was passed that finally allowed breweries to sell their
wares directly to customers and retailers alike. However, in the wake of this
monumental law change, only two craft microbreweries have subsequently managed
to open their doors in the entirety of the county.</p>
<p>It's time to fill that void. We can
stand up and usher America's craft beer revolution straight into Bethesda. Its
residents are primed and ready. We are primed and ready. All we need is your
help.</p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>The biggest risk lies in the SBA's
formal underwriting process. We are raising these funds to meet the liquid cash
requirement that our SBA rep team has quoted to us after providing them with
our personal and business financials. Our rep team indicated that with our
current financial status, we would need at least 30% of the total project costs
in liquid capital to go forward with underwriting. This fundraising campaign
will get us to that mark. At that point, it is in the hands of the SBA's
underwriting team to approve the loan.</p>
<p>As with any underwriting process,
there is always the risk, however small, that the loan is not approved and cash
is not disbursed. To the best of our knowledge, we do not know of any reason
why this might happen and we have the utmost confidence that our SBA rep team
is leading us towards success. However, it is important to note that SBA loan
denial is possible and is the primary risk to the project. In the case of SBA
loan denial, we will evaluate where we stand and make an informed decision on
how to proceed. We will keep all of our contributors in communication as we
move through the process. We do not take your generous contributions lightly.</p>
<p>The other risk for this crowdfunding
campaign is that we do not meet our cash fundraising goal, thereby preventing
us from entering into the underwriting process in the first place. In
order to mitigate this risk, we are continuing to pursue alternate routes of
raising cash in parallel to this crowdfunding campaign. One avenue we are
pursuing is the sale of equity in the business to private investors. Please
contact Bailey or Brendan O'Leary at True Respite if you are curious about
purchasing an equity stake in the business. For reference, the minimum cash
requirement for equity investment is $9,000.</p>
<p>In the unfortunate case that we do
not meet our crowdfunding campaign's fundraising goal by the campaign deadline,
we will still continue our efforts to sell equity in the business privately
until such a point that we are either fully funded, capable of reapplying for
an SBA loan, or no longer believe that our business plan is feasible as it
exists. Should the latter occur, we will be reevaluating all facets of the
business including the option to cancel the project and reimburse the funds
contributed back to the contributors, less any costs, fees, etc. that we have
incurred <i>only </i>as a direct result of the crowdfunding process.
We will not spend the money unless we have raised enough to complete our
project. </p>
<p>This potential reimbursement is not
required of the platform nor any laws that we are aware of, but we feel it is
the right thing to do for our supporters. However, let's hope that the day
never comes.</p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>Sharing is caring! We'd really
appreciate your help in getting this fundraising campaign absolutely as much exposure
as possible. We know sometimes it's hard to think of who you might share us

understand that we, the founders, will be personally guaranteeing 100% of that
True Respite loan. We are quite literally putting every single dime we have and
every asset we own on the line to acquire this loan. We believe in this
business and we believe in ourselves.
Please help us finally make our
dream come true as we bring the people of Bethesda, Maryland, the destination
brewery and tap room they deserve.
What You Get
In addition to our sincerest
gratitude, we are honored to reward cash contributors with the following:


Merchandise!


Private Tours!


Private Parties!


A brew day with the Brewmaster in
the True Respite brewery!


The right to name a fermenter!


Invitation to join our secret
society, The Chilluminati


I dunno, bees?


So much more!


Check out the ""Perks""
section for more specific details on the contribution tiers and their perks. If
we hadn't already poured so much cash into this thing, we'd be all over those contribution
tiers. Maybe not the bees, though.
The Impact
You could be our hero; our legend,
even. This could be your legacy. This is that big. Today, our business plan,
some legal documents, and a pretty neat logo and crest are all we have to show
for the past year and a half of endless hard work and thousands of dollars spent.
But with your help, we could be breaking ground on an iconic destination
brewery in very short order.
This isn't just for us, though.
Sure, it's our dream. It's our passion. It's our raison d'être. But this is
also for our customers. Bethesda, Maryland's only brewery is a small setup
inside the Rock Bottom restaurant located in town. For those unfamiliar, Rock
Bottom is a national restaurant and brewpub chain owned under the same
corporate parent as the Gordon Biersch brewpubs, the Denver ChopHouse, the
Walnut Brewery, and that neat little brewpub at the Boardwalk hotel in Disney
World. Although they make pretty good beer, the business is hardly local and
certainly not unique.
Meanwhile, craft beer is growing by
leaps and bounds all across America. Denver, Colorado, alone has over 90
breweries and is still growing. Yet despite its meteoric growth nationwide,
Bethesda, Maryland, a city with over 450,000 people living within just 5 miles
of its central downtown area, has somehow managed to play host to one single
brewery stuck inside a national restaurant and brewpub chain. That's it. This,
in the city ranked the #1 most educated place in America by Forbes and the top
earning town in America by Time in 2014 alone.
It's not a coincidence.
Montgomery County, the county in
which Bethesda resides, previously prohibited the sale of beer from producers
to on-premise customers and off-premise retailers. That all changed in July of
2014 when a new law was passed that finally allowed breweries to sell their
wares directly to customers and retailers alike. However, in the wake of this
monumental law change, only two craft microbreweries have subsequently managed
to open their doors in the entirety of the county.
It's time to fill that void. We can
stand up and usher America's craft beer revolution straight into Bethesda. Its
residents are primed and ready. We are primed and ready. All we need is your
help.
Risks & Challenges
The biggest risk lies in the SBA's
formal underwriting process. We are raising these funds to meet the liquid cash
requirement that our SBA rep team has quoted to us after providing them with
our personal and business financials. Our rep team indicated that with our
current financial status, we would need at least 30% of the total project costs
in liquid capital to go forward with underwriting. This fundraising campaign
will get us to that mark. At that point, it is in the hands of the SBA's
underwriting team to approve the loan.
As with any underwriting process,
there is always the risk, however small, that the loan is not approved and cash
is not disbursed. To the best of our knowledge, we do not know of any reason
why this might happen and we have the utmost confidence that our SBA rep team
is leading us towards success. However, it is important to note that SBA loan
denial is possible and is the primary risk to the project. In the case of SBA
loan denial, we will evaluate where we stand and make an informed decision on
how to proceed. We will keep all of our contributors in communication as we
move through the process. We do not take your generous contributions lightly.
The other risk for this crowdfunding
campaign is that we do not meet our cash fundraising goal, thereby preventing
us from entering into the underwriting process in the first place. In
order to mitigate this risk, we are continuing to pursue alternate routes of
raising cash in parallel to this crowdfunding campaign. One avenue we are
pursuing is the sale of equity in the business to private investors. Please
contact Bailey or Brendan O'Leary at True Respite if you are curious about
purchasing an equity stake in the business. For reference, the minimum cash
requirement for equity investment is $9,000.
In the unfortunate case that we do
not meet our crowdfunding campaign's fundraising goal by the campaign deadline,
we will still continue our efforts to sell equity in the business privately
until such a point that we are either fully funded, capable of reapplying for
an SBA loan, or no longer believe that our business plan is feasible as it
exists. Should the latter occur, we will be reevaluating all facets of the
business including the option to cancel the project and reimburse the funds
contributed back to the contributors, less any costs, fees, etc. that we have
incurred only as a direct result of the crowdfunding process.
We will not spend the money unless we have raised enough to complete our
project. 
This potential reimbursement is not
required of the platform nor any laws that we are aware of, but we feel it is
the right thing to do for our supporters. However, let's hope that the day
never comes.
Other Ways You Can Help
Sharing is caring! We'd really
appreciate your help in getting this fundraising campaign absolutely as much exposure
as possible. We know sometimes it's hard to think of who you might share us
with, so we've compiled a short list to help get your brain kickstarted:


Your friends


Your parents


Your siblings


Your estranged niece (and her rich
uncle)


Your dog


Rick Steves


Notch


Your college roommate


That strange person you met on the
bus that one time


Your ex (even though you've totally moved
on)


Your fantasy league


Your dungeon dwelling peers


A pragmatic urban explorer (yes, any
one will do)


Your SCUBA instructor


That cute Starbucks barista at that ultra-convenient
corner location


EVERYONE!


It takes a healthy combination of
personal messages to close friends and family along with shares on social media
for projects like this to realize their greatest potential. Whatever you can
spend a moment doing to make a difference will really help us. We know it's
tough, but this is our dream and we can't do it without you.
Thank you, and...
