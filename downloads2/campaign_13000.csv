<p>Hi, we're <strong>CAKE</strong>. The Chicago Alternative Comics Expo. Separately, we are Edie Fake, Grace Tran, Jeff Zwirek, Max Morris, and Neil Brideau. Together we've spent the last 2 years organizing the first alt. comics festival to come to Chicago in over 15 years.</p>
<p>The <strong>Chicago Alternative Comics Expo</strong> [CAKE] is a weekend-long celebration of independent comics, inspired by Chicago’s rich legacy as home to many of underground and alternative comics’ most talented artists– past, present and future. Featuring comics for sale, workshops, exhibitions, panel discussions and more, CAKE is dedicated to fostering community and dialogue amongst independent artists, small presses, publishers and readers.</p>
<p>CAKE is <strong>free and open to the public</strong>, but due to some unexpected expenses, we've fallen a little short of our budget.</p>
<p>In addition to helping us remain solvent this year, any money you contribute will <strong>help us remain independent</strong> and to grow the show for next year and hopefully for many years to come.</p>
<p>The organizers for CAKE are <strong>all volunteers</strong>, so any money you give will go directly into the festival and making it the best festival for attendees and exhibitors.</p>
<h3>What we need from you</h3>
<p>We're looking to raise $3000. Why $3000? That's basically the amount it will take to cover the expenses we didn't expect. (First year shows sheesh!)</p>
<p>It will also provide the nest egg for next years show.</p>
<p>Once again, all organizers for CAKE are volunteers (i.e. we aren't getting paid anything) so whatever you give towards all the things that make a festival great, like...</p>
<ul>
<li>Attracting top level talent</li>
<li>Exhibiting in a convenient and vibrant location</li>
<li>Advertising, so other cool people like you find out about our event</li>
<li>And the really fun stuff, like table rentals!</li>

Jack O' Lanterns have always been considered creepy and crafting scary ones with a knife has always been a Halloween mission. Creating a story about living, monsterous Jack O' Lanterns indigenous to another planet seemed like a natural place to go for a fun sci fi/ horror project.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The synopsis of the story started with the idea of a marine squad with high tech weaponry sent to investigate the disappearance of prison terraformers on the new found planet Maia. Because of the abundance of pumpkin-like vegetation on Maia, the planet was deemed habitable by the human race because of the oyxgen the plants produced. And there lies the rub... A Venus Fly trap, if you will..</p>
<p>Heres an excerpt: ""(Corporal)DAD(aka Dorothy) hears him and alerts the rest of us, “…CONTACT! 5 O‘CLOCK, 20 METERS” Before we know what has happened…they’re on us. Large gangly, misshapen demonic-looking Jack O’Lanterns with spindly, vine-shaped bodies smacking at us from all different directions. Somehow, these innate looking pumpkins awoke from the pumpkin patch and were now demons from Hell and far worse then any Nightmare Before Christmas I could ever imagine.""</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Putting this 24 page book together and seeking publishing is no small task. I'm hoping to raise a minimum of $3000 to pay for a good amount of the project and printing(if need be). I have a beautiful cover already, pencilled by comics great, TOM RANEY, inked by myself, MARK McKENNA, and to be colored by old ally and great comic artist, MIKE McKONE. I have secured the interior pencil art by the excellent JASON BAROODY(soon to post art!) with interior inks by myself. TBD as for colors and letters...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Heres the interesting part... I have a couple of publishers ""informally"" interested in looking further into the possibility of publishing JACKS. If that were to happen that would take away the possibility of me as a self publisher or an indie publisher taking the helm. That would change the game as far as the rewards coming from me personally, but I will see to it that all pledges are honored, even if I have to buy and supply the comics from a 3rd party...</p></div>","COMBAT JACKS is my new creator-owned project and is being treated as a ONE SHOT sci fi/horror comic in the vein of the old EC WEIRD SCIENCE FANTASY meets VAULT of HORROR books from the 50's.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi there! We are Freaks Don't Bite, a company created by 3 strange, artistic and driven women made to infiltrate the illustrative community, with wit, positivity and a different approach to individuality.</p>
<p>We met in college and hit it off, realized even with our varying styles to art and creativity, our message is the same:</p>
<p> That the world is becoming more and more diverse, that more canadians are mixing nations, that our country is becoming a hot bed of nations within nations. It can be confusing, frustrating and most importantly alienating. We want to reach out to the world and show that being different is not so different. That there are more people looking to experience the beauty that resides in all cultures. That no matter your sex, cree, background or upbringing we all want the same thing. To be happy, fed and to feel good about being who we are. </p>
<h3>What we do</h3>
<p>Our team is made up of illustrators, graphic designers, web designers and artists. We all work as independent artists in order to continue to work on our collective project: Freaks Don't Bite. We are all versed in HTML, CS Suites and anything art oriented. We are available for commission pieces, or contract work.<br/><br/></p>
<h3>What we want to do</h3>
<p>Using FDB as a platform we would like to keep creative projects running, There are graphic novels and cartoons in the works and most importantly we would like to give back to the community by giving workshops for children.</p>
<p>Considering the arts are getting less and less funding in our schools we would like to donate our time and expertise to those less fortunate, as well as support other artists getting launched who may have a harder time getting noticed. We believe in teamwork and positivity, there is enough exploitation in the world, lets work together to fill it with more exuberance! </p>
<p>With your contribution, you will not only help our business but help the artistic community by allowing us to spread the word of creativity and passion for all things weird.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We will need $3,000 in funding to grow our business. Our intention is to have another computer to streamline our workflow. We would like to grow and continue working on  our projects, things like graphic novels and cartoons to help spread the word! We have put a lot of blood sweat and tears into this company, and we still believe that we can make a difference.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Freaks Dont Bite is based on the idea that being weird isn't a bad thing. Because of our similar up-bringings, we noticed that there is a lack of confidence, especially when it comes to self-expression within our community.</p>
<p>Sex has become too much of a focus when it comes to impact, amd as much as we can appreciate human rights, we also believe that being playful doesn't necessarily mean exposing yourself. By accepting our inner misfit we are all still beautiful and can thrive.</p>
<p>We hope to celebrate this with our creativity, intelligence and ingenuity, using our products, we hope to shed light on these issues and spread positivity and hopefully create a community in which people learn to be more accepting of differences and people can express themselves more freely without having to worry about trends or media expectations.</p>
<p><br/>We have already began making changes within our community and spread positivity to all the people we encounter. But we need to reach greater heights if we want to continue to grow.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If your bank account is empty, never fear! You can still help us by getting the word out!</p>
<p>Just share the link or use the indiegogo share tools to spread the news about our campaign. Any contribution will help us immensely! Thank you for your time and stay classy!</p>

<h3>Ugly Monsters</h3>
<p>Ugly Monsters is a naughty and humoristic comic celebrating gay urbanite life. The Monsters' nights (and morning afters) are all about dating, partying, self-reflection and underwear brands. While H-P discovers the content of his pants, Jojo is trying to get his phone-addicted boyfriend's attention and Lulu craves fast food and hot guys. And so on. All of them are way too old to still be in their 20s (shh, it's a secret) but the Monsters don't mind and keep on goofing around. </p>
<p>Ugly Monsters promotes sex and body positivity, plays around with gay stereotypes and gives attention to gay topics that have not been on display that much before. Regardless of the gay aspect, Ugly Monsters are characters that anyone can relate to. </p>
<p>The comic is created by Joakim Juvelén, a graphic designer and comic artist from Finland, who sometimes uses himself and his friends as material for his comics. With his comics Joakim wants to increase conversation about being gay and in this way improve knowledge of minorities.  It's not okay that being gay is still an ugly thing nowadays. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><i>Rumat Möröt</i></h3>
<p><i>Rumat möröt on roisi ja riemukas homosarjakuva, jossa mörkökaverukset seikkailevat deittailun, bilettämisen, itsetutkiskelun ja kalsarimerkkien kyllästämässä maailmassa. Siinä missä yksi ihmettelee housujensa sisältöä, toinen on perso roskaruualle ja miehille. Kolmas kiukuttelee, jotta saisi huomiota kännykkäriippuvaiselta poikaystävältään. Parikymppisiksi möröillä on liikaa ikää (hys, salaisuus), mutta se ei näy käytöksessä – asioita tehdään ja möläytellään sen enempää ajattelematta. </i></p>
<p><i>Rumat möröt  rummuttaa seksi- ja kehopositiivisuuden puolesta, leikittelee homomaailman stereotypioilla sekä käsittelee myös siihen liittyviä, vähemmän esillä olleita puolia. Möröt ovat hahmoja, joihin voivat homonäkökulmasta huolimatta samaistua kaikki.   </i></p>
<p><i>Sarjakuvan on luonut Joakim Juvelén, helsinkiläinen graafikko ja sarjakuvataiteilija, joka toisinaan ammentaa aiheita sarjakuviinsa niin omasta kuin ystäviensäkin elämästä. Sarjakuvillaan Joakim haluaa lisätä keskustelua homoudesta. Ei ole ok, että homous ruma asia vielä nykypäivänäkin.</i><br/> </p>

</div></div>","Ugly Monsters
Ugly Monsters is a naughty and humoristic comic celebrating gay urbanite life. The Monsters' nights (and morning afters) are all about dating, partying, self-reflection and underwear brands. While H-P discovers the content of his pants, Jojo is trying to get his phone-addicted boyfriend's attention and Lulu craves fast food and hot guys. And so on. All of them are way too old to still be in their 20s (shh, it's a secret) but the Monsters don't mind and keep on goofing around. 
Ugly Monsters promotes sex and body positivity, plays around with gay stereotypes and gives attention to gay topics that have not been on display that much before. Regardless of the gay aspect, Ugly Monsters are characters that anyone can relate to. 
The comic is created by Joakim Juvelén, a graphic designer and comic artist from Finland, who sometimes uses himself and his friends as material for his comics. With his comics Joakim wants to increase conversation about being gay and in this way improve knowledge of minorities.  It's not okay that being gay is still an ugly thing nowadays. 
 
Rumat Möröt
Rumat möröt on roisi ja riemukas homosarjakuva, jossa mörkökaverukset seikkailevat deittailun, bilettämisen, itsetutkiskelun ja kalsarimerkkien kyllästämässä maailmassa. Siinä missä yksi ihmettelee housujensa sisältöä, toinen on perso roskaruualle ja miehille. Kolmas kiukuttelee, jotta saisi huomiota kännykkäriippuvaiselta poikaystävältään. Parikymppisiksi möröillä on liikaa ikää (hys, salaisuus), mutta se ei näy käytöksessä – asioita tehdään ja möläytellään sen enempää ajattelematta. 
Rumat möröt  rummuttaa seksi- ja kehopositiivisuuden puolesta, leikittelee homomaailman stereotypioilla sekä käsittelee myös siihen liittyviä, vähemmän esillä olleita puolia. Möröt ovat hahmoja, joihin voivat homonäkökulmasta huolimatta samaistua kaikki.   
Sarjakuvan on luonut Joakim Juvelén, helsinkiläinen graafikko ja sarjakuvataiteilija, joka toisinaan ammentaa aiheita sarjakuviinsa niin omasta kuin ystäviensäkin elämästä. Sarjakuvillaan Joakim haluaa lisätä keskustelua homoudesta. Ei ole ok, että homous ruma asia vielä nykypäivänäkin. 


 
About the book
The comic book is going to be a hardcover book, 120 pages, 18 × 18 cm (7 × 7 inches) and over 50 % of the content is going to be new, never published material. The book content is going to be black and white with pink highlights and full color covers. The book will be published in two different language versions (English and Finnish) in October 2020.

<p>I'm Megan Uosiu. I'm a freelance illustrator and I work for game development companies 
when I get the opportunity to. In my free time I do illustrations and 
comics. My dream from a long time ago is to be a mangaka, or a comic 
book artist.<br/>I've been drawing since I was a little child and I think
 it is finally time for me to turn this hobby into a real full-time 
work. But before that I want to make at least one of my dreams come 
true  - to get a copy of my printed comic book on my shelf. <br/>I've 
been drawing comics for some time now, but due to some circumstances 
(like a hard disk crashing xD) I was never able to. So this will be my 
very first comic book published EVER. I'm really excited for this and I 
hope this campaign will help me make it true.<br/>Since I started talking about my dreams, I will share another one with you all.<br/>For
 over 10 years now me and my artist friends have had this art club 
called MDH, that is like a drawing circle to us. Together we started 
many projects, but haven't quite finished most of them. By making this 
project successful I would also like to get their motivation in place, 
so that all of them will finish their own personal projects like mine 
(which all of them are awesome, by the way). So I hope this project will
 be just a beginning. For me. And for all of us. <br/><br/><b>THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT!</b></p>

<h1>Plot summary</h1>
<p>An utterly lazy god, an anthropomorphic personification of the Snow Leopard, rests upon his favourite tree, when suddenly woken up by a thrown stone.  The thrower turns out to be a young admirer of his former self. The youngster persuades the lazy god to begin a quest for fame, glory and world salvation. While the one concerned would have preferred to just lie down and go back to sleep.</p>

Hello! My name is Megan Uosiu and I'm the author of the ""Lazy Snow Leopard"" webcomic. The goal of this project is to gather enough money to print this webcomic into an actual, physical comic book. And then get it delivered to your house!




About me

| DeviantArt | SmackJeeves | Tapastic | Tumblr | Twitter | Instagram | Facebook |
I'm Megan Uosiu. I'm a freelance illustrator and I work for game development companies 
when I get the opportunity to. In my free time I do illustrations and 
comics. My dream from a long time ago is to be a mangaka, or a comic 
book artist.I've been drawing since I was a little child and I think
 it is finally time for me to turn this hobby into a real full-time 
work. But before that I want to make at least one of my dreams come 
true  - to get a copy of my printed comic book on my shelf. I've 
been drawing comics for some time now, but due to some circumstances 
(like a hard disk crashing xD) I was never able to. So this will be my 
very first comic book published EVER. I'm really excited for this and I 
hope this campaign will help me make it true.Since I started talking about my dreams, I will share another one with you all.For
 over 10 years now me and my artist friends have had this art club 
called MDH, that is like a drawing circle to us. Together we started 
many projects, but haven't quite finished most of them. By making this 
project successful I would also like to get their motivation in place, 
so that all of them will finish their own personal projects like mine 
(which all of them are awesome, by the way). So I hope this project will
 be just a beginning. For me. And for all of us. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT!

... So, what is my comic about?

Plot summary
An utterly lazy god, an anthropomorphic personification of the Snow Leopard, rests upon his favourite tree, when suddenly woken up by a thrown stone.  The thrower turns out to be a young admirer of his former self. The youngster persuades the lazy god to begin a quest for fame, glory and world salvation. While the one concerned would have preferred to just lie down and go back to sleep.


Comics

This is the main idea of my story, set in the universe that is a mix of the samurai and fantasy world, with a touch of modern times. You can read the first three chapters of it on SmackJeeves' ""Lazy Snow Leopard"" webcomic page already. 
But I would be really happy to see my book printed and to put it on my shelf as well. With your help, I can make this happen!
The plan is to print it on A5 format, black and white on 80g/m2 white paper, with a laminated paperback full-colour one-side print cover. 




If I can gather at least 1000$ I should be able to print about 100 copies and send it to the receivers without using my own funds. And that would be really awesome!



Goals
If I can gather 1000$ the comic will be printed. But that's not all...!

If I can gather 1500$ I will redraw some of the pages of chapter 1 and add tones to make it look more similar to the rest of the comic.

And if I can gather 6000$ I will redraw the first few pages in colour, to make it look even more like a real manga.
With 7000$ I will add chapter 5 to the comic book vol. 1. 
And if by some miracle I can hit 10 000$ with this, I will start working on volume 2 of the comic book right away, instead of looking for another job. ;D

And finally - here's how you can help me make it all happen:

<p>Meet Juan Quintanilla, a hero-watcher in a world inhabited by masked superheroes and villains. When Juan's favorite heroine, Badger Babe, suddenly goes missing, replaced by a strange doppelganger, Juan sets out on a journey to find her. The 3-part series: Journey of the Juan,  follows Juan's transformation from meager internet e-celeb to the most unlikely of superhero: JUANPOOL!!!</p>
<p>The evolution of Juanpool from concept to the page has been an incredible story. Originally created as a meme for a tongue-in-cheek contest for a YouTube channel, Juanpool quickly gained a life of his own as a fan favorite, and would eventually become Troy's very first self-produced comic book. Created while on hard times, living out of the back of his car, Troy's first effort would go on to be nominated for ComixCentral's Comic of the Year award, where it consistently holds a spot in the Top 10. Now, with the backing of the Science Wizard Comics label, Troy can finally do what less than a year ago seemed impossible: Do a print run!</p>

<p>In the long forgotten realm of 2020 in the inkiest of tobers a scroll detailing the escapades of certain coven of witches was revealed. I set straight to work documenting the existence of this Eclectic Coven in pen rendered pictographs. For the first time these original 32 drawings from October 2020 are being collected along with some older and newer witch art, sketches and ramblings from my archive. There will also be a bonus mini comic featuring the witch Phoebe.  All together over 40 pages of bewitching goodness. Looking forward to sharing this collection with you.</p>

</div></div>","In the long forgotten realm of 2020 in the inkiest of tobers a scroll detailing the escapades of certain coven of witches was revealed. I set straight to work documenting the existence of this Eclectic Coven in pen rendered pictographs. For the first time these original 32 drawings from October 2020 are being collected along with some older and newer witch art, sketches and ramblings from my archive. There will also be a bonus mini comic featuring the witch Phoebe.  All together over 40 pages of bewitching goodness. Looking forward to sharing this collection with you.


All artworks for the book are already complete. Each rendered in beautiful black ink. Elegant and bold. Also never before seen process sketches for some of the drawings will be included.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><i><strong>The Abyssal Tournament of Champions has begun. Achilles has proven himself worthy of his place through his clash with the first hero Gilgamesh! However, Achilles' return to peace has been stalled as Hades makes an offer he just can't refuse. He now joins the ranks of the Champions of Hades alongside Theseus, slayer of the Minotaur, and Herakles, the mighty hero who conquered the 12 labors. Together they will fight to win this tournament, and their next opponent is a foe that has yet to be defeated in the arena.... the champion of Egyptian Lord of the Dead, Osiris.</strong></i></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong><i>Elysian Fields</i></strong> is more than just a book at this point, it's a statement of change. That the industry is becoming a place where the fans of these books no longer have to be ignored by the Big 2 and instead of having their criticisms ignored, they can instead strike out on their own and make a book that appeals to themselves and other likeminded fans. There is a dire need of Escapism in the world right now, a break from all the misery and darkness, an escape to a world of heroes that preservere and the rules of reality need not apply. This is what is at the heart of <i><strong>Elysian Fields</strong></i>, a fantasy for its readers to escape to and enjoy as mythic legends clash in a grand, epic scale!</p>

out there, film fans!  </b><br/><p><a href=""http://youtu.be/A6E5ZTT6flo?list=UUvM15Qpkut4QMTlRGOl2eWQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Campaign Pitch from YouTube Land</a><br/>
We’ve been working hard to produce a series of parody films that will let you
see some of your favorite iconic characters in media pit themselves against the
Joker himself inside the walls of the Asylum!</p><p>
</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1157548/files/20150118144449-JG2Web.jpg?1421621089"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
This little idea all started with Lucky Mangione sitting on a couch watching
The Dark Knight for the bajillionth time. 
As the interrogation room scene played out on the screen in front of him
again, he casually thought, “What would happen if Joker was questioned by all
these other random people instead of Batman?” 
The conversation that came afterwards led to him meeting with JC
Kingsley over in Charlotte, North Carolina, to discuss what it might take to
make something like that happen.<p>
<br/>
Lucky also got in touch with Heath Simms and Kiefer Diaz to come in as sound
and camera on the project and lined up a sweet spot to film out in Belmont,
North Carolina.  The Old Stone Steakhouse
is connected to the old Belmont Jailhouse, and they let us film there
repeatedly watching us go in and out of their back rooms in a myriad of
costumes constantly.  JC got in touch
with his Brother-in-law, Kaden Suon, to come in and help act out some parts,
and Lucky brought in Jennifer Smith on Makeup and Eric Helda as an extra
security guard type in the Asylum.  </p><p>
</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1157557/files/20150118144556-_TJK3706.jpg?1421621156"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
It really looked like things were going to come together, and we all began to
discuss getting these episodes together and getting them out there to you
guys!  Well, we got a cool trailer done
already that we want you to see right here:<br/>
<a href=""http://youtu.be/M7kS_lWKXJ0"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://youtu.be/M7kS_lWKXJ0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Trailer HERE!</a> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> If
you like what you saw there, then stay tuned for the series debut on January 22<sup>nd</sup>,
2015!  The first episode will go out that
Thursday, and we plan to be able to release one per week EVERY THURSDAY for a
six episode run.  And we got that far on
our own and think you can see our progress as we went!  We’re all independent film-makers and actors
in the Charlotte area, and we want to see our film community continue to grow
even as lawmakers decide to restrict the tax programs that support the larger
business end of things.  We also LOVE the
Carolina communities that get behind the arts and help them thrive, and we
believe that things like this indy project help people like us make our own
Hollywood right here at home to support our home environment in ways that
support our dreams and goals, too!  All
while supporting local businesses that feel the same way and provide equipment
and filming locations to our efforts!<br/><h3>The Impact</h3> 
We
got six of these in the can already to show you that we mean business as
film-makers.  We didn’t want to be just
another one of those campaigns that puts together a trailer and then never gets
past that point even though we asked for all your money.  We did it. 
We made six, and we wanna keep making six as long as you keep laughing
at ‘em!  We WOULD like some help though,
so if you can spare a few bucks towards us hopeful film enthusiasts to get some
of that cool stuff over there on the right side of the screen, we’ll cut
backflips and bother people on the street with songs of praise in your
name!  Sometimes… On Saturdays… past two
a.m.  No, seriously, we’d love to be able
to keep doing these and even make some other series lines for you folks in the
future, but we all gotta eat, too. 
Sometimes, we spent a full work week for free typing, editing, filming
while some of us worked full time jobs at the same time.  We’d love to know that you thought this stuff
was cool enough to keep going, and that you didn’t mind out of all those hits
on YouTube to spare a five dollar bill here or spring for some of those cool
extras that we’re offering as perks to go along with your at home enjoyment of
our show!<br/><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FOxdQTVCRwDQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DOxdQTVCRwDQ&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FOxdQTVCRwDQ%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

cool stuff as we go along, so we promise it won’t get boring!  Come along for the ride and if it’s past the

<p>Hey, folks!<br/>
JC Kingsley here!  <br/><br/>
As Director/Producer/Writer of the “ASYLUM: the lost interrogations” series, I’m
constantly looking for and listening to ways we can upgrade our production and
release continuously more refined material for your viewing pleasure.  I just wanted to take a second and show you
guys what we’ve used so far and what the results were of using that equipment.<br/>
<br/>
Also, we’ve started an Indiegogo Campaign to help raise funds for further
equipment needs and other needs going forward, and I wanted to let you folks
know what the money would be used for should you choose to help us out in this
endeavor.<br/>
<br/><b>
Here’s what we’ve used so far:</b><br/>
<br/>
<b>Camera </b>- Black Magic 2.5 (Prologue and Episode 1) and Canon 5D (Episode 2)<br/>
<b>Lighting </b>– Standard LED block light of about 5 inches by 3.5 inches for
overhead swinging interrogation room light  (Prologue and Episode 1); Two 500 Watt Fresnel Lights, One 1K Watt Fresnel Light, 250 Watt Bare Bulb Incandescent.  (Episode 2)<br/><b>Sound </b>– Zoom H4N (<a href=""http://www.guitarcenter.com/Zoom-H4N-Portable-Digital-Recorder-106869043-i1712724.gc?country=us&amp;currency=usd&amp;source=4WWRWXGP&amp;gclid=CMuksqyMnsMCFdEdgQodcwEADA&amp;kwid=productads-plaid%5e65674144602-sku%5e106869043@ADL4GC-adType%5ePLA-device%5ec-adid%5e46499340282"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.guitarcenter.com/Zoom-H4N-Portable-Digital-Recorder-106869043-i1712724.gc?country=us&amp;currency=usd&amp;source=4WWRWXGP&amp;gclid=CMuksqyMnsMCFdEdgQodcwEADA&amp;kwid=productads-plaid^65674144602-sku^106869043@ADL4GC-adType^PLA-device^c-adid^46499340282</a>)

(Prologue and Episode 1);  Zoom H4N Field Recorder, Sennheiser ME 65 and ME 66 shotgun mics (Episode 2).<br/>
<b>Location </b>– Old Stone Steakhouse in Belmont, NC has the original town jailhouse
attached to the back end of it.  <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1157564/files/20150118144833-d29f0ff15e5aecb56fd5705bc3965187.jpg?1421621313"" src="""" style=""""/></p>They use
the lower part of the jail for restaurant storage and equipment like freezers
and such, but the top floor of the jail is pretty much empty.  Lucky Mangione contacted them and asked them
about it, and they let us use the place for credits listed in the films.  Can’t beat that with a stick.  It’s a little bit limited on Electrical
outlets, but we haven’t run into any problems yet on it.  We even made one of our Indiegogo perks a
dinner at the steakhouse with a special appearance by Joker and Commissioner
Gordon, so check it out if you’re interested. 
It comes with a tour of the filming location after dinner!<br/>
<b>Editing Software</b> – We’ve been using Pinnacle Studio 15 for our editing
needs.  It’s one of the most overlooked
editing programs out there due to market saturation in school by Adobe/Apple,
and it costs a tenth of what the Final Cut or Premiere programs will run
you.  <br/>
<b>Soundtrack</b> – We’ve had a lot of luck pulling our soundtrack material from
YouTube’s royalty free music selection. 
Jingle Punks has been a big help to us in making this sound impressive
through the soundtrack, and we highly recommend fellow film-makers to check
them out!<br/>
<b>Sound FX</b> – FreeSounds.org has been where most of our Sound FX have been
located, and what we didn’t use from there, we were grabbing off of the
Pinnacle Software.<br/>
<b>Make Up</b> – Nimbus Creations has been used in the Prologue Episode as well as the
Deathstroke Episode for the scars on the Joker. 
We also have used home-made gelatin make-up prosthetics from Carolyn
Kingsley’s stash of makeup goodies and find those to be a little better than
most store bought prosthetics, and they’re CHEAP!  So, there’s that.  You can find out how to make your own gelatin
based prosthetics on YouTube and have fun with them!<br/>
<b>Costumes</b> – We have all been responsible for putting together our own costumes
on this project and all guest spots on the show come to set with their own
costumes as well.  That way the guests
get a credit for acting on the program but also for costuming as well!  <br/>
<br/>
Here’s what we’d like to upgrade to in the future with your help:<br/>
<br/>
<b>Camera</b> – We’re pretty happy with the DSLR (Canon 5D and Canon 70D) for this
series and think the Black Magic may be overkill for the most part.  The Black Magic also exports as RAW files
with no color correction in place.  They
expect you to use DaVinci Resolve to color correct the footage after importing,
but any color correction program can really be used for it.  What we DO want to do for our camera crew in
supply them with a few extra nuances like having a Focus Puller on set to assist
in getting scenes put together for our Director of Photography.  A Focus Puller just sets stops (marking a
place on the camera focus ahead of time) on the camera’s focus to let the guy
shooting the scene know exactly where the focal points of a scene are so that
it’s not left to guess work on the fly. 
Basically, a guy comes in and has the actors stand in their spots
through the scene, and then he adjusts the focus to each position that they’re
standing and marks those spots off using zip ties and a marker or an actual
piece of equipment like this:<br/>
<a href=""http://www.bhphotovideo.com/bnh/controller/home?O=&amp;sku=1049634&amp;gclid=CI6DuoWLnsMCFQ_l7AodFTkAIg&amp;Q=&amp;is=REG&amp;A=details"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.bhphotovideo.com/bnh/controller/home?O=&amp;sku=1049634&amp;gclid=CI6DuoWLnsMCFQ_l7AodFTkAIg&amp;Q=&amp;is=REG&amp;A=details</a><br/>
As you can see, this is a minimal purchase to increase our quality by a
LOT!  It’s only going to cost around 50
bucks of the 3,500 we’re asking.<br/>
You can read more about the idea here:<br/>
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_puller"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_puller</a><br/>
<br/>
<b>Lighting and Sound</b>:  <br/>
We’ve found our solution for Lighting and Sound by pulling in a pro, Mr. Willie
Kimbrough.  Willie costs us a little bit
(and by industry standards, I mean a LITTLE bit), but he’s worth his weight in
gold when it comes to lighting a shot and pulling all the extra sound we
need.  Basically, some of the money
collected will go to paying the 100 bucks it costs to get him out there, and
that 100 bucks gets us pro light and sound, so we think you’ll agree that it’s
well warranted.  We’ve got four more
episodes to get filmed so that’s at least 400 of the 3,500 we’re asking via the
campaign.<br/>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1157573/files/20150118144959-willie.jpg?1421621399"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Here’s a bit about what Willie uses on our set for you other film-makers out
there:<br/>
Two 500watt fresnel lights, one 1k fresnel light, Zoom H4n
field recorder, Sennheiser ME 65 and ME 66 shotgun mics, 250 watt bare bulb
incandesant bulb.
<p><b>Editing Software</b>:<br/>
We’d like to upgrade our old Pinnacle 15 to Pinnacle’s newest release @
18.  You can find out more about the
software here:<br/>
<a href=""http://www.pinnaclesys.com/publicsite/us/home/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.pinnaclesys.com/publicsite/us/home/</a><br/>
We also will begin using Final Cut Pro on our material every other episode as
we bring in Ernest Eich to work with us. 
He will be editing every other episode with it, so there will be a good
comparison of the two programs for people to see and judge for themselves.  We may end up choosing one or the other, but
we wanted to let folks see the difference in the two if all the equipment used
on a shoot was the same.  The upgrade on
Pinnacle costs around 120 of the 3,500 we’re asking.<br/>
<b>Soundtracking</b>:  <br/>
We’re stoked that it’s been so easy to find music online for this project, but
we have heard some of these tunes on other shows as well.  That being said, Charlotte has some great
local artists in all different genres of music, and we’d love to give them a
shot at being on the show as well.  We
don’t want them to necessarily pony up their song for free though.  We’d like to pay at least 50 per song used to
the local artists that help us out with their music, so if you guys can help
out in that regard that would be great! 
Typically we look for a song at the beginning creds, ending creds and
sometimes something in the middle to keep things lively.  So with four episodes left to go, that’s
between 400-600 dollars in music money for local artist support!<br/>
<br/><b>
Guest spots and Acting Talent:</b><br/>
We’d like to be able to pay each guest spot at least 35 dollars for the four
hours it takes us to shoot one of these episodes.  With four episodes left this season, that’s
140 buckaroos of the 3500.  No sweat
right?<br/>
<br/><b>
Make-up and Costuming Fund:</b><br/>
We’ve been ponying up all the money for supplies on costumes and make-up on our
own, so any help there would be appreciated. 
We also want to have a little on-hand to grab props that would help
round out an outfit for our guests, so that they can stay focused on making the
costume look the best that they can. 
Things like a big Mallet for Harley, or a microphone prop for Oprah,
etc.  We’re looking for around 300
dollars of the fund to go towards those needs.<br/>
<br/><b>
Additional costs:</b><br/>
We’re doing our best to publicize the series, market it, distribute it and all
those trimmin’s, so that, of course, costs us as well.  In January, we spent about 200 on Printed
Goods, Online Ads, and additional video shots to make the campaign info and
other adverts, so we’re looking at that as the baseline expense per month on
that kind of thing.  We should wrap the
first season’s film dates in March/April so we’re looking for 200-400 dollars
to carry us through on that end.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1157577/files/20150118145101-Deathstroke2ofClubs.jpg?1421621461"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<br/><b>

out there, film fans!  Campaign Pitch from YouTube Land
We’ve been working hard to produce a series of parody films that will let you
see some of your favorite iconic characters in media pit themselves against the
Joker himself inside the walls of the Asylum!

This little idea all started with Lucky Mangione sitting on a couch watching
The Dark Knight for the bajillionth time. 
As the interrogation room scene played out on the screen in front of him
again, he casually thought, “What would happen if Joker was questioned by all
these other random people instead of Batman?” 
The conversation that came afterwards led to him meeting with JC
Kingsley over in Charlotte, North Carolina, to discuss what it might take to
make something like that happen.

Lucky also got in touch with Heath Simms and Kiefer Diaz to come in as sound
and camera on the project and lined up a sweet spot to film out in Belmont,
North Carolina.  The Old Stone Steakhouse
is connected to the old Belmont Jailhouse, and they let us film there
repeatedly watching us go in and out of their back rooms in a myriad of
costumes constantly.  JC got in touch
with his Brother-in-law, Kaden Suon, to come in and help act out some parts,
and Lucky brought in Jennifer Smith on Makeup and Eric Helda as an extra
security guard type in the Asylum.  

It really looked like things were going to come together, and we all began to
discuss getting these episodes together and getting them out there to you
guys!  Well, we got a cool trailer done
already that we want you to see right here:
Trailer HERE! What We Need & What You Get If
you like what you saw there, then stay tuned for the series debut on January 22nd,
2015!  The first episode will go out that
Thursday, and we plan to be able to release one per week EVERY THURSDAY for a
six episode run.  And we got that far on
our own and think you can see our progress as we went!  We’re all independent film-makers and actors
in the Charlotte area, and we want to see our film community continue to grow
even as lawmakers decide to restrict the tax programs that support the larger
business end of things.  We also LOVE the
Carolina communities that get behind the arts and help them thrive, and we
believe that things like this indy project help people like us make our own
Hollywood right here at home to support our home environment in ways that
support our dreams and goals, too!  All
while supporting local businesses that feel the same way and provide equipment
and filming locations to our efforts!The Impact 
We
got six of these in the can already to show you that we mean business as
film-makers.  We didn’t want to be just
another one of those campaigns that puts together a trailer and then never gets
past that point even though we asked for all your money.  We did it. 
We made six, and we wanna keep making six as long as you keep laughing
at ‘em!  We WOULD like some help though,
so if you can spare a few bucks towards us hopeful film enthusiasts to get some
of that cool stuff over there on the right side of the screen, we’ll cut
backflips and bother people on the street with songs of praise in your
name!  Sometimes… On Saturdays… past two
a.m.  No, seriously, we’d love to be able
to keep doing these and even make some other series lines for you folks in the
future, but we all gotta eat, too. 
Sometimes, we spent a full work week for free typing, editing, filming
while some of us worked full time jobs at the same time.  We’d love to know that you thought this stuff
was cool enough to keep going, and that you didn’t mind out of all those hits
on YouTube to spare a five dollar bill here or spring for some of those cool
extras that we’re offering as perks to go along with your at home enjoyment of
our show!Other Ways You Can Help 
We’ll
keep you updated with cool social media content, photography stills, posters,
playing cards, vid clips of behind the scenes stuff, and all kinds of other
cool stuff as we go along, so we promise it won’t get boring!  Come along for the ride and if it’s past the
January 22nd release date as you read this, go here to check out
some episodes and find the link to the new support campaign!
LuckyKings YouTube Page - Subscribe Now!Our Equipment List Current and Desired:

Hey, folks!
JC Kingsley here!  
As Director/Producer/Writer of the “ASYLUM: the lost interrogations” series, I’m
constantly looking for and listening to ways we can upgrade our production and
release continuously more refined material for your viewing pleasure.  I just wanted to take a second and show you
guys what we’ve used so far and what the results were of using that equipment.

Also, we’ve started an Indiegogo Campaign to help raise funds for further
equipment needs and other needs going forward, and I wanted to let you folks
know what the money would be used for should you choose to help us out in this
endeavor.

Here’s what we’ve used so far:

Camera - Black Magic 2.5 (Prologue and Episode 1) and Canon 5D (Episode 2)
Lighting – Standard LED block light of about 5 inches by 3.5 inches for
overhead swinging interrogation room light  (Prologue and Episode 1); Two 500 Watt Fresnel Lights, One 1K Watt Fresnel Light, 250 Watt Bare Bulb Incandescent.  (Episode 2)Sound – Zoom H4N (http://www.guitarcenter.com/Zoom-H4N-Portable-Digital-Recorder-106869043-i1712724.gc?country=us&currency=usd&source=4WWRWXGP&gclid=CMuksqyMnsMCFdEdgQodcwEADA&kwid=productads-plaid^65674144602-sku^106869043@ADL4GC-adType^PLA-device^c-adid^46499340282)
; Rode NTG Shotgun Mic Bundle (http://www.austinbazaar.com/rode-ntg2-multi-powered-shotgun-microphone-rod-ntg2-combo-dlx.html?utm_source=google-pads&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=ROD-NTG2-COMBO-DLX&channel5=true&coupon=yes&gclid=CIX908eMnsMCFdgKgQodtj0AmQ)
(Prologue and Episode 1);  Zoom H4N Field Recorder, Sennheiser ME 65 and ME 66 shotgun mics (Episode 2).
Location – Old Stone Steakhouse in Belmont, NC has the original town jailhouse
attached to the back end of it.  They use
the lower part of the jail for restaurant storage and equipment like freezers
and such, but the top floor of the jail is pretty much empty.  Lucky Mangione contacted them and asked them
about it, and they let us use the place for credits listed in the films.  Can’t beat that with a stick.  It’s a little bit limited on Electrical
outlets, but we haven’t run into any problems yet on it.  We even made one of our Indiegogo perks a
dinner at the steakhouse with a special appearance by Joker and Commissioner
Gordon, so check it out if you’re interested. 
It comes with a tour of the filming location after dinner!
Editing Software – We’ve been using Pinnacle Studio 15 for our editing
needs.  It’s one of the most overlooked
editing programs out there due to market saturation in school by Adobe/Apple,
and it costs a tenth of what the Final Cut or Premiere programs will run
you.  
Soundtrack – We’ve had a lot of luck pulling our soundtrack material from
YouTube’s royalty free music selection. 
Jingle Punks has been a big help to us in making this sound impressive
through the soundtrack, and we highly recommend fellow film-makers to check
them out!
Sound FX – FreeSounds.org has been where most of our Sound FX have been
located, and what we didn’t use from there, we were grabbing off of the
Pinnacle Software.
Make Up – Nimbus Creations has been used in the Prologue Episode as well as the
Deathstroke Episode for the scars on the Joker. 
We also have used home-made gelatin make-up prosthetics from Carolyn
Kingsley’s stash of makeup goodies and find those to be a little better than
most store bought prosthetics, and they’re CHEAP!  So, there’s that.  You can find out how to make your own gelatin
based prosthetics on YouTube and have fun with them!
Costumes – We have all been responsible for putting together our own costumes
on this project and all guest spots on the show come to set with their own
costumes as well.  That way the guests
get a credit for acting on the program but also for costuming as well!  

Here’s what we’d like to upgrade to in the future with your help:

Camera – We’re pretty happy with the DSLR (Canon 5D and Canon 70D) for this
series and think the Black Magic may be overkill for the most part.  The Black Magic also exports as RAW files
with no color correction in place.  They
expect you to use DaVinci Resolve to color correct the footage after importing,
but any color correction program can really be used for it.  What we DO want to do for our camera crew in
supply them with a few extra nuances like having a Focus Puller on set to assist
in getting scenes put together for our Director of Photography.  A Focus Puller just sets stops (marking a
place on the camera focus ahead of time) on the camera’s focus to let the guy
shooting the scene know exactly where the focal points of a scene are so that
it’s not left to guess work on the fly. 
Basically, a guy comes in and has the actors stand in their spots
through the scene, and then he adjusts the focus to each position that they’re
standing and marks those spots off using zip ties and a marker or an actual
piece of equipment like this:
http://www.bhphotovideo.com/bnh/controller/home?O=&sku=1049634&gclid=CI6DuoWLnsMCFQ_l7AodFTkAIg&Q=&is=REG&A=details
As you can see, this is a minimal purchase to increase our quality by a
LOT!  It’s only going to cost around 50
bucks of the 3,500 we’re asking.
You can read more about the idea here:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_puller

Lighting and Sound:  
We’ve found our solution for Lighting and Sound by pulling in a pro, Mr. Willie
Kimbrough.  Willie costs us a little bit
(and by industry standards, I mean a LITTLE bit), but he’s worth his weight in
gold when it comes to lighting a shot and pulling all the extra sound we
need.  Basically, some of the money
collected will go to paying the 100 bucks it costs to get him out there, and
that 100 bucks gets us pro light and sound, so we think you’ll agree that it’s
well warranted.  We’ve got four more
episodes to get filmed so that’s at least 400 of the 3,500 we’re asking via the
campaign.
Here’s a bit about what Willie uses on our set for you other film-makers out
there:
Two 500watt fresnel lights, one 1k fresnel light, Zoom H4n
field recorder, Sennheiser ME 65 and ME 66 shotgun mics, 250 watt bare bulb
incandesant bulb.
Editing Software:
We’d like to upgrade our old Pinnacle 15 to Pinnacle’s newest release @
18.  You can find out more about the
software here:
http://www.pinnaclesys.com/publicsite/us/home/
We also will begin using Final Cut Pro on our material every other episode as
we bring in Ernest Eich to work with us. 
He will be editing every other episode with it, so there will be a good
comparison of the two programs for people to see and judge for themselves.  We may end up choosing one or the other, but
we wanted to let folks see the difference in the two if all the equipment used
on a shoot was the same.  The upgrade on
Pinnacle costs around 120 of the 3,500 we’re asking.
Soundtracking:  
We’re stoked that it’s been so easy to find music online for this project, but
we have heard some of these tunes on other shows as well.  That being said, Charlotte has some great
local artists in all different genres of music, and we’d love to give them a
shot at being on the show as well.  We
don’t want them to necessarily pony up their song for free though.  We’d like to pay at least 50 per song used to
the local artists that help us out with their music, so if you guys can help
out in that regard that would be great! 
Typically we look for a song at the beginning creds, ending creds and
sometimes something in the middle to keep things lively.  So with four episodes left to go, that’s
between 400-600 dollars in music money for local artist support!

Guest spots and Acting Talent:
We’d like to be able to pay each guest spot at least 35 dollars for the four
hours it takes us to shoot one of these episodes.  With four episodes left this season, that’s
140 buckaroos of the 3500.  No sweat
right?

Make-up and Costuming Fund:
We’ve been ponying up all the money for supplies on costumes and make-up on our
own, so any help there would be appreciated. 
We also want to have a little on-hand to grab props that would help
round out an outfit for our guests, so that they can stay focused on making the
costume look the best that they can. 
Things like a big Mallet for Harley, or a microphone prop for Oprah,
etc.  We’re looking for around 300
dollars of the fund to go towards those needs.

Additional costs:
We’re doing our best to publicize the series, market it, distribute it and all
those trimmin’s, so that, of course, costs us as well.  In January, we spent about 200 on Printed
Goods, Online Ads, and additional video shots to make the campaign info and
other adverts, so we’re looking at that as the baseline expense per month on
that kind of thing.  We should wrap the
first season’s film dates in March/April so we’re looking for 200-400 dollars
to carry us through on that end.

All together, our costs look like this:
Camera – 50 bucks for a focus puller, and 50 bucks for the camera Folks (150
total)
Lighting/Sound – Willie costs 100 bucks
Soundtracking – Local artist fund of 400-600 dollars
Guest Spots – 140 dollars for the remaining episodes in this season
Makeup and Costume Props – 300 Dollars
Editing Software Upgrade – 120 Dollars
Editing Team Pay – 50 per (100 dollars)
Printed Goods and other Marketing – 200-400 dollars

Total costs listed :  1,510 – 1,910 for
remaining episodes in Season 1
Remaining Costs:  1990 – 1590 for next
season’s costs

I've created a lot of different packages with different perks.  Please go through them and see which suit your taste.  When you select one, you'll be asked for your payment info and a shipping/contact address.
Thank-You!


Retailers of book stores and comic shops!

Want to stock Stardrop on your shelves and support this campaign?  That's wonderful!  I've put together basic packages of 5 and 10 copies.  You get a 40% discount and I pay shipping.  Please see the side bar perks section under the retailer options.  (I apologize; Indiegogo puts all perk packages in descending order based on cost, so the two I designed for you are mixed in with the others.  Just look for the label, ""RETAIL"")
 
$30 - 5 copies, Free Ship (Retailers only - copies signed)$60 - 10 copies, Free Ship (Retailers only - copies signed)You can also order copies of the FIRST volume of Stardrop.  Simply specify in your order using the above two options.
 
 

 
 

The hard numbers. . .

Here's the project cost breakdown; where those dollars will be going:
$4200 - Printing cost and taxes on 2000 copies. Printing is done in Canada.$2376 - Rough estimate for shipping costs of individual and retail copies pre-ordered during this campaign.$274 - Indiegogo takes 4%.$6850 -- TOTAL
 
Please note: none of the money raised during this campaign will end up in my pocket; it all goes toward printing and shipping.
How do I pay myself for the hundreds of hours invested in writing and drawing this book? Why, with all the left over copies! I will endeavor to sell these over the next few years on my own. For me, the end of this campaign will represent the beginning of the next stage of my work, but that can't happen without a book in hand. This campaign will make that possible!

<h2><strong>Our friend Aaron has dreamed up a concept for a claymation series that he would like to pitch to MTV, Adult Swim, Cartoon Network, etc.  I've read the treatment and heard the verbal pitch...and I think it's brilliant!  Without giving too much away I will say that it's about a classic mythical creature...that drinks, smokes, chases women, eats celebrities, and generally reeks havoc on American pop culture.  It's hilarious.  </strong></h2>
<h2><strong>Aaron has been experimenting with stop-motion animation since he was a young child.  One of his earliest attempts was around middle school age, when he animated a toilet transform into a robot!  He begin working seriously again with the claymation technique in 2008, during his production of a documentary called Fatty (which you can see the results of in the video above). </strong></h2>
<h2><strong>Recently Aaron was laid off from his job in LA and moved off-the-grid with a friend, so that he could concentrate full-time on this project.  His plan is to create a short sample segment from the show, to use in order to get funding to create a full pilot episode. The thing about claymation is that in order to create even 30 seconds of animation, it takes hours upon hours to complete.  And that's just the animated aspect.  Before even getting to that stage Aaron must build the set, the props, and sculpt the characters.  </strong></h2>
<h2><strong>He needs about $1000-$2000 to complete this project.  So far he's built half of the set, created some props (see the ""gallery"" for pics) and has started sculpting one of the characters.  The scene consists of two characters sitting around a campfire next to the fuselage of a crashed airplane containing marijuana plants.  Your contributions would go towards materials including fabric, wood, expensive clay, glue, and more.  In addition your money would contribute towards Aaron's basic living expenses while he completes this endeavor.  To even get to the point of pitching this to a major network, Aaron must have something which visually demostrates his concept, plus show that he is capable of handling the animation aspect of the job.  That's why he needs to create this scene and ultimately a full-length pilot episode.  </strong></h2>
<h2><strong>Over the past decade Aaron has produced a string of short and full-length films and documentaries for other people.  Now it's his time to shine.  So please help us make this a reality and help get some Wachholz-vision out into the universe!!  </strong></h2>

<h2>What is The Editors?</h2>
<p><strong>The Editors</strong> is an ongoing comic book series from artist <strong>Davy Shirley</strong> (the webcomic <a href=""http://angelk.at/fera/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fera</a>) and writer <strong>Paul Burr</strong>. <strong>The Editors</strong> are a clandestine group who are controlling the lives of the world's various heroes and villains, until a two bit crook wakes up during one of their procedures.</p>
<p>Follow his adventures as he attempts to unravel the mystery that lies at the heart of <strong>The Editors</strong> and at the same time stop himself from becoming just another cape.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Who?</h2>
<p><strong>The Editors</strong> is a new project from <strong>angelKat Entertainment</strong> - with the creator of the popular LGBT romance/adventure webcomic ""<a href=""http://angelk.at/fera/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fera</a>"", <strong>Davy Shirley</strong>, and the talented writer of dark fiction, <strong>Paul Burr</strong>.</p>
<p>With the success of <strong>Fera</strong>, and with a new writing team working on various new projects at <strong>angelKat Entertainment</strong>, between us we have experience of producing both print and digital comics since 2009, as well as having writing experience both in fiction, and in articles for national magazines.</p>
<p><strong>angelKat Entertainment</strong> and all of our creators are based in the <strong>United Kingdom</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What are you funding?<br/></strong></h2>
<p>Any money raised from these pre-orders, will go towards the first print run of <strong>issue #1</strong> of <strong>The Editors</strong>. Issue #1 will be a <strong>24 page</strong> long, <strong>full colour</strong>, comic book, professionally printed by <strong>Ka-Blam</strong> in the USA. This will partially fund the print run, and the rest will be coming out of our pockets. We will be printing enough books to cover all pre-orders and stock for conventions/online sales. We hope to have the first books in our hands by <strong>July 2012</strong> (and hopefully available at <strong>London Film and Comic Con</strong>).</p>
<p>If we manage to surpass the goal on IndieGoGo, we'll also be using the extra funding to promote the new comic to national/international press, at events, and possibly for printing of future titles - such as the already scripted sequel, a short story compilation, and the new instalment of Fera (issue #3).</p>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; In fact, for each instance where the funding amount increases by $100 over the goal amount of $500, we'll throw in extra goodies for donators - including extra artwork, and other existing and future titles from <strong>angelKat Entertainment</strong> (depending on perk tier). &lt;&lt;</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em><strong>NOTE FOR FUNDERS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED KINGDOM:</strong> <strong>Please add $5 to your order on top of the minimum for the bundle that you wish to receive (at least). This is to allow for postage and packaging. Thank you.</strong><br/></em></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What do you get?</h2>
<p>The main purpose of this IndieGoGo campaign is a pre-order for our new comic, but to show our appreciation for your interest, and because services like IndieGoGo make it simpler to make a reality... We are including extra perks, <strong>bundle deals</strong> if you will, depending on how much you wish to spend. You can get anything from a <strong>PDF</strong> for your favourite eReader, to a whole host of extras including <strong>cameos</strong>, <strong>commissioned artwork</strong>, <strong>limited edition comics</strong>, and even <strong>your very own super hero story</strong>.</p>
<p>For every bundle/perk tier that you go up, you include every item from the lower tiers. Take a look at the list on the right hand side for more details and choose what bundle you feel is right for you. And it's completely up to you how much you pay - it can be anything so long as it's above the minimum for your chosen bundle.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>

<h3>The Humor Times: 'The World's Funniest News Source!'</h3>
<p>The <strong>Humor Times</strong><sup>®</sup> (already nationally trademarked) is a monthly publication, featuring the ""news in cartoons"" – a humorous review of the latest in national and international events and politics.</p>
<p>It features editorial cartoons by some of the finest artists in the business, organized by subject and strung together into a storyline by ""quips"" above each one. This way of presenting the great work of political cartoonists makes for a ""comic book"" feel, and summarizes each issue in such a way that even folks who are unfamiliar with the particular subject being covered can follow along, and get some real news along with the humor!</p>
<p>The magazine also features non-political cartoons, humor columns, ""fake news,"" and many other fun features. It is based in Sacramento, California.</p>
<p>The <strong>Humor Times</strong> appeals to people who like to follow politics and the news, and enjoy our irreverant take on it. It might be described as a print version of Comedy Central's ""The Daily Show,"" although it was founded in 1991, long before that show debuted -- so maybe the show is actually a TV version of the Humor Times!</p>
<p>It attracts a similar audience to the Daily Show, yet most of that national demographic doesn't yet know it exists.</p>
<p>And that is why we are raising funds: for a national marketing campaign for the publication, to raise awareness, and grow our subscription base.</p>
</div>
<p>While many of those who have discovered the <strong>Humor Times</strong> love it and subscribe to it, we have never had the budget to help it to grow nationally. We've been struggling financially through the years, and the time has come to expand.</p>
<p>The <strong>Humor Times</strong> is a publication that we believe -- as do our loyal readers -- has a lot of merit. It helps people to laugh, rather than cry, about our current national politics, and so gives them fortitude to keep going, to believe things can and will get better.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking to fundraise $20,000. You can help America smile again, by helping the <strong>Humor Times</strong>!</p>
<p>We're offering different perks for different levels of support. Please check them out, and give what you can.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<div>
<p>If you can’t contribute, that doesn’t mean you can’t help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Help us to get the word out and make some noise about our campaign! Share this page on Twitter, Facebook, by email, or however else you want. </li>
<li>Use the Indiegogo share tools!</li>
<li>Check out our website at <a href=""http://www.humortimes.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.humortimes.com</a>, and share it as well. We get a lot of subscriptions from people discovering us through the site.</li>
<li>Buy a subscription! It's cheaper than donating, but still helps us. The cheapest one is getting the magazine in downloadable form, rather than a physical copy. That is only $9.95 a year!</li>

It features editorial cartoons by some of the finest artists in the business, organized by subject and strung together into a storyline by ""quips"" above each one. This way of presenting the great work of political cartoonists makes for a ""comic book"" feel, and summarizes each issue in such a way that even folks who are unfamiliar with the particular subject being covered can follow along, and get some real news along with the humor!
The magazine also features non-political cartoons, humor columns, ""fake news,"" and many other fun features. It is based in Sacramento, California.
The Humor Times appeals to people who like to follow politics and the news, and enjoy our irreverant take on it. It might be described as a print version of Comedy Central's ""The Daily Show,"" although it was founded in 1991, long before that show debuted -- so maybe the show is actually a TV version of the Humor Times!
It attracts a similar audience to the Daily Show, yet most of that national demographic doesn't yet know it exists.
And that is why we are raising funds: for a national marketing campaign for the publication, to raise awareness, and grow our subscription base.

While many of those who have discovered the Humor Times love it and subscribe to it, we have never had the budget to help it to grow nationally. We've been struggling financially through the years, and the time has come to expand.
The Humor Times is a publication that we believe -- as do our loyal readers -- has a lot of merit. It helps people to laugh, rather than cry, about our current national politics, and so gives them fortitude to keep going, to believe things can and will get better.
What We Need & What You Get
We are looking to fundraise $20,000. You can help America smile again, by helping the Humor Times!
We're offering different perks for different levels of support. Please check them out, and give what you can.
Other Ways You Can Help

If you can’t contribute, that doesn’t mean you can’t help:

Help us to get the word out and make some noise about our campaign! Share this page on Twitter, Facebook, by email, or however else you want. 
Use the Indiegogo share tools!
Check out our website at www.humortimes.com, and share it as well. We get a lot of subscriptions from people discovering us through the site.
Buy a subscription! It's cheaper than donating, but still helps us. The cheapest one is getting the magazine in downloadable form, rather than a physical copy. That is only $9.95 a year!

<p>Hi, horror and comics fans! I'm Graham Nolan, a 35+ year veteran writer/artist of the comic book gulags. Over the years you've probably seen my work for DC and Marvel Comics and if you don't already know, I'm the designer and co-creator of the iconic Batman villain, BANE! I'm also the creator of <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/graham-nolan-s-return-to-monster-island/x/23547517#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">MONSTER ISLAND</a> (which is still available on Indiegogo) and the artist on the successful, <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-expendables-go-to-hell-graphic-novel/x/23547517#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">THE EXPENDABLES GO TO HELL</a> (also still available) to name a few!</p>
<p>THE CHENOO is a story I've been kicking about for a couple years now but because it's a self-contained story there was never an outlet for it with the major comic book publishers. I think readers are looking for good  stories that don't require them to invest in multiple issues when the story could have been told in one without all the padding.</p>
<p>People like YOU, with crowdfunding, have changed the paradigm of graphic storytelling. Now there are no limits on the types of stories that can me told. Your trust and investment in these new ideas and ways of doing things is really ushering in a new GOLDEN AGE OF COMICS!</p>
<p>So a big thank you for checking out my story!</p>

<h3>THE STORY:</h3>
<p>In 1977 a once in 500 year winter storm hit the city of Buffalo, paralyzing the region. 23 deaths were <i>attributed</i> to the storm but the truth could never be revealed. There was something hiding in the snow and wind. Something evil and malignant.  And it was hungry.</p>
<p>Today, another monster storm is brewing over the lake and once again it is bringing more than wind and snow. It's bringing death!</p>
<p>Paul Jackson was a kid during the storm of '77 when his father, Jimmy was the chief of police. His dad told him stories about the storm that couldn't and <i>shouldn't</i> be shared.</p>
<p>Stories of the Chenoo. A giant frozen creature of Native American lore that comes off the ice to eat the hearts of its victims in search of the warmth it will never have.</p>
<p>Now Paul is a cop and it's happening all over again.</p>

OUR HERO: PAUL JACKSONHello and welcome!
Hi, horror and comics fans! I'm Graham Nolan, a 35+ year veteran writer/artist of the comic book gulags. Over the years you've probably seen my work for DC and Marvel Comics and if you don't already know, I'm the designer and co-creator of the iconic Batman villain, BANE! I'm also the creator of MONSTER ISLAND (which is still available on Indiegogo) and the artist on the successful, THE EXPENDABLES GO TO HELL (also still available) to name a few!
THE CHENOO is a story I've been kicking about for a couple years now but because it's a self-contained story there was never an outlet for it with the major comic book publishers. I think readers are looking for good  stories that don't require them to invest in multiple issues when the story could have been told in one without all the padding.
People like YOU, with crowdfunding, have changed the paradigm of graphic storytelling. Now there are no limits on the types of stories that can me told. Your trust and investment in these new ideas and ways of doing things is really ushering in a new GOLDEN AGE OF COMICS!
So a big thank you for checking out my story!
 

THE STORY:
In 1977 a once in 500 year winter storm hit the city of Buffalo, paralyzing the region. 23 deaths were attributed to the storm but the truth could never be revealed. There was something hiding in the snow and wind. Something evil and malignant.  And it was hungry.
Today, another monster storm is brewing over the lake and once again it is bringing more than wind and snow. It's bringing death!
Paul Jackson was a kid during the storm of '77 when his father, Jimmy was the chief of police. His dad told him stories about the storm that couldn't and shouldn't be shared.
Stories of the Chenoo. A giant frozen creature of Native American lore that comes off the ice to eat the hearts of its victims in search of the warmth it will never have.
Now Paul is a cop and it's happening all over again.

<p>“For years I’ve been dreaming up an insane comedy sci-fi series called SHRINKAGE about an all-out battle against nano-scale alien invaders, all taking place inside the President of the United States’ brain,” said Kutner. “But these days, with so many comic book houses focused on in-house superhero properties, it was hard for a comics ‘noob’ like me to sell the idea.""</p>
<p>""Then <a href=""http://www.farragocomics.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Farrago Comics</a> came along, which already had a ton of cool comics on their app and wanted to do something special for their first original comic.

Now this story no longer needs to battle within my brain, but is becoming a reality.""</p>
<p>As opposed to television for which Rob regularly writes, the average person does not have a comic book reading habit. We all believe that by making comics free to read and thus lowering the entry barrier to a medium that everyone can (and once did) enjoy, Farrago Comics is doing both fans and creators a mammoth service. Fans don’t have to pay anything but attention to try out great comics, and creators win by sharing in-comic ad revenue each time their comic is read. So help us not only make a funny comic book, but impact a whole industry by helping spread the Farrago Comics platform to bring joy to readers and a new avenue for both appreciation and remuneration, to creators.</p>

There has been a great response over the last couple days so we have decided to extend the campaign for SIX MORE DAYS! As a thank you for all the wonderful support for SHRINKAGE we are reducing the VIP Conan Pack to $500 and adding four more slots for the Cameo Appearance Pack. We are overwhelmed from everyone's support and are very excited about finishing SHRINKAGE.
Short Summary Rob Kutner's SHRINKAGE is a comedic, sci-fi action tale about how the most unknowable battleground we face is the one within our own craniums. An 8-part comics series, written by 5-time Emmy Award winning writer Rob Kutner (""The Daily Show with Jon Stewart,"" ""Conan"") and illustrated by renowned comics artist John Lucas (X-Men, Deadpool), it will be distributed digitally and offered to readers FREE, via the new Farrago Comics app. This is the first original comics series produced by Farrago Comics, a FREE app for Apple and Android devices, that provides FREE comics by today’s top creators, as well as Golden Age goodies galore. By helping SHRINKAGE happen you’ll also be a part of the movement to make it easier for everyone to read comics. If you have yet to download the Farrago Comics app, you can do so for iOS & Android here: iOS and Android


So What is Shrinkage?

Aliens have invaded.
Not in giant motherships – inside the brain of the President of the United States. They are nano-scale, feed on radiation, and are trying to use their host to turn the Earth into one giant, glowing bon-bon of radioactivity.


But not if barrel-chested, quasi-mystical uber-patriot 3 1/2-STAR GENERAL (long story) STURGE McCRAIN has anything to say about it.
He and brilliant, dysfunctional, embittered brain scientist DR. LANA PERCY undergo experimental (as in, they're its first-ever test subjects) Pentagon miniaturization technology and are shot right up the Most Powerful Nose in the Free World to find and kill or be killed by the Nano-invaders.


And all they’ll have to do in the midst of battling is...

Steer clear of the MICROGLIA, immune-system macrophages that devour hostile bodies… or imprison them in an unbreakable scar;
Survive the treacherous MEMORY FOGS of the hippocampus (particularly brutal: “The Battle of That Time Mom Walked in On Him Masturbating”)
Defeat the totally unhinged creations of the DREAM LABYRINTH (ever heard a US Corporal say, “Deploy the gangsta-rapping burrito – STAT!”?);

Oh, and did I mention Sturge and Lana also have to keep PRESIDENT BENNETT DULLARD functioning normally? (Imagine major global arms talks where a brain-battled Chief Executive suddenly pisses himself and heils Hitler).


That’s because they’re the only ones who can know about the aliens – and their mini-mission – besides BART, a Secret Service agent with a twisted hero complex, and DR. BENARI, the President’s exhaustingly cheerful Physician.And decidedly NOT on our heroes’ side is FIRST LADY ELIZA DULLARD who suspects something’s happening inside our man, and determined to root it out – by any drug necessary.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">AIC Comics Presents:</h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Tales From The Streets Of Guangzhou</h3>
<p>Hi folks, my name's Michael. In April 2017 I launched my self-published line of comics and graphic novels called AIC Comics. My first series, Shexie Meiren, was released later that year. To help with the high cost of publishing comic books, I created a crowdfunding campaign that was very successful - so much so that I was able to publish a second comic. This one was about a side character from Shexie Meiren called 'The American,' a vigilante who's tough on crime and not afraid to cross the line. I called it 'Tales from the Streets of Guangzhou."" The overwhelmingly positive comments it received blew me away and the book nearly outsold the first issue of Shexie Meiren. Backers wanted to know if they would see more of the The American in his solo outing.</p>
<p>Well, I'm happy to announce that we at AIC Comics have been working on an expanded story line for the fan-favorite character. 'Tales from the Streets of Guangzhou' will be a four-part, 100+ page paperback graphic novel full of action as The American faces off against the rising threat of the Liu Mang Triad. The story is written by myself and the artwork is done by the original artist Allen Warner, along with some well-known comic pros such as Netho Diaz (GI:Joe - A Real American Hero, IDW &amp; Halo, Dark Horse) and amazing indie creators like Jarret Katz.</p>
<p>Your support will help us to complete this book that is nearly two years in the making. As of now, three of the four parts are already finished! Work on the final part will begin immediately following this campaign and will incorporate elements from the backer perks, including the chance for you to become a major recurring character!</p>
<p>Thank you for your consideration in backing this project. We at AIC Comics are very passionate about this story and we're excited to have you be a part of it. Read on to learn more about our campaign and the sweet perks we're offering to backers. If you have any questions, check out the FAQs below or feel free to send us a message. As always, stay awesome, my friends!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We're asking for $2,000 to go towards costs of completing and publishing the book. This includes: interior page artwork, cover artwork, ISBN registration, printing, shipping, marketing, and other various expenses. Should we exceed that goal, the additional funds will go toward the other projects we have going on at AIC Comics, including costs of other publications (of which we have many - see the FAQs for more info) and expenses for comic-con appearances (our appearance schedule is also in the FAQs, which we will keep updated). In the unfortunate event that we don't reach our entire goal, we will use the funds raised to complete the book with other resources. Either way, 'Tales from the Streets of Guangzhou' will see the light of day.</p>
<p>We hope very much to avoid the latter scenario and so we've come up with perks that will appeal to backers of every kind, including a variety of low-, middle-, and high-end items. Check them out below and please don't hesitate to ask us any questions.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Perks</h3>
<p>Here you can find more information on the perks we're offering to our backers. We'll be updating this section as more perks come along, including milestone rewards and stretch goals. Is there something you'd like in particular, but don't see it here? Send us a message and we'll see what we can do! We like to work with our backers to come up with some great rewards for supporting us.</p>
<p><strong>The Book:</strong> First and foremost, we're offering both digital and print copies of Tales from the Streets of Guangzhou - all 100+ pages on high quality paper that highlights the artwork by Allen Warner.</p>
<p><strong>Chibi Stickers:</strong> We asked frequent collaborator Rey Ramos of Rain Art Studios (Spiderman, Marvel) to design a set of chibi stickers from some of AIC Comics' most popular titles, including: The American, Shexie Meiren, Agent Sparx, and Um Khuzi. The designs are adorable. For digital backers, we're still giving you the set in PNG format.</p>
<p><strong>Wallpaper Set:</strong> Put The American in the background of your desktop, phone, or tablet with this set of wallpaper designed by comic pro Netho Diaz and rising indie star Jarret Katz. The American has never looked so good.</p>
<p><strong>Comic Art Prints:</strong> The same amazing illustrations used for the wallpaper are also available in standard comic-size prints, plus more that you haven't seen yet! All are included in both digital and print perks and they are gorgeous.</p>
<p><strong>Cosplay Prints:</strong> We recently did a fun photo shoot with models who portrayed two of our more popular characters, Shexie Meiren and Agent Sparx. The shoot was a blast and the pictures are great! Both digital and print perks will include an autographed photo.</p>
<p><strong>Become a Major Recurring Character:</strong> This is one perk that I'm very excited to offer. This is a chance to have your likeness used to design one of five recurring characters - all of whom will be introduced in the fourth and final part of this book! In addition, indie creator Jarret Katz will design an exclusive poster with all five characters that will be used in promotion of the book. You'll need to provide us with images of your face, which we'll ask for at the conclusion of this campaign. The five characters will be leaders of a worldwide criminal organization and will be the main antagonists of the sequel to this book, but will also play an important role in the fourth part of this book!</p>
<p><strong>Custom Cover by Staz Johnson:</strong> Do you like one-of-a-kind perks? Do you like comic book covers drawn by industry pros? You may just want to consider claiming this perk! Staz Johnson has been drawing comics since the late 80's and has done work for both Marvel and DC, among other publishers, including Spider-Man and Batman. He's one of my personal favorite comic artists and he's an all-around awesome guy. You'll get to provide us with your idea for a cover and Staz will draw it! It's as simple and amazing as that!</p>
<p><strong>Custom Cover by Netho Diaz:</strong> These custom cover perks are very limited, but we want to offer as many as possible. Netho's work is included in other perks, but this time you decide what you want to see on the cover of your copy of Tales from the Streets of Guangzhou. </p>
<p><strong>Custom Cover by Diego Bernard:</strong> Diego is another brilliant comic pro who recently finished a run of X-Men. He's done work with AIC Comics in the past and we can't love him enough. Again, you provide us with your idea for the cover of your copy of Tales from the Streets of Guangzhou and we'll pass it along to Diego. <u>For all custom cover perks, we'll ship your one-of-a-kind copy once it's ready, which will be around the same time as when other perks are sent out.</u></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This will be our third crowdfunding campaign, albeit the first on Indiegogo. While our most recent Kickstarter was unsuccessful, we can attribute that to an unfortunate injury that beset me and took me away from doing the work necessary for a successful campaign. However, we've had two very successful Kickstarters prior to that and we're excited to make the move to Indiegogo for our fourth project. We have a lot of experience not just in crowdfunding, but also publishing and so the risks are easily identifiable and planned for.</p>
<p>Being in China, shipping tends to be the biggest issue. However, we've worked with customs to figure out the best and most efficient ways to get your perks to you, no matter where you are in the world. If for any reason there is a delay, we'll work with customs to clear any issues.</p>
<p>In the past, we've had issues with the quality of printing - the end product always turned out great, but it used to take a few tries before we got it right. The reason for this is that printers in China - and most people for that matter - aren't familiar with the format of western comics. There's no market for them here. But recently we were introduced to a printer in Suzhou (outside of Shanghai) who's been working with comic creators for years and knows exactly what's needed. He's been a breath of fresh air for us and so printing is much more efficient and cheaper, which means we're able to sell our products at a lower price.</p>

Tales From The Streets Of Guangzhou
Hi folks, my name's Michael. In April 2017 I launched my self-published line of comics and graphic novels called AIC Comics. My first series, Shexie Meiren, was released later that year. To help with the high cost of publishing comic books, I created a crowdfunding campaign that was very successful - so much so that I was able to publish a second comic. This one was about a side character from Shexie Meiren called 'The American,' a vigilante who's tough on crime and not afraid to cross the line. I called it 'Tales from the Streets of Guangzhou."" The overwhelmingly positive comments it received blew me away and the book nearly outsold the first issue of Shexie Meiren. Backers wanted to know if they would see more of the The American in his solo outing.
Well, I'm happy to announce that we at AIC Comics have been working on an expanded story line for the fan-favorite character.

<p>In October of 2012, I confronted the worst of an injury I had been strategically ignoring since that spring. After consulting a doctor, I was told that the intense and enduring pain around my vocal cords was a very bad strain and in my case, the severity of the injury would determine the length of the recovery—six months, if not more. It has now been two years, with no end in sight.</p>
<p></p>
<p>DUMB is the story of living day to day without a voice. I spent almost three months speaking less than 30 minutes a day, sometimes going for a few days or a week at a time without speaking at all. Since then, I’ve been increasing my painless speech time every day, little by little, and now find myself able to speak normally for up to three hours at a time before I need to rest.</p>
<p>My recovery continues, but the comics will end. If you want your copies before anyone else, this is your chance!</p>

What's <i>State's Evidence</i> and why the hell should I give you my money?</h3> <p>I'm Alan Brash from <a href=""http://shootfirst-productions.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Shoot First Productions</a> in Auckland, New Zealand. My bio is <a href=""http://shootfirst-productions.com/about-alan-brash/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a> but in short, I'm a screenwriter, producer, development executive, writing tutor &amp; film-maker with more than 20 years' experience in the film &amp; TV industry. This is my first foray into comics and graphic novels. (If you've watched the video, you'll know that my place is definitely <i>not  </i>in front of the camera!)</p>
<p><i>State's Evidence</i> is a crime thriller which started life as a feature film screenplay. It placed well in a couple of script competitions and a few years ago I came across Italian artist, Giuseppe D'Elia, on-line (when we found out we'd been ripped-off by the same scam artist!) We formed an awesome long-distance working relationship, powered by Skype and email, and created the first 52 pages of a full-color graphic novel, which represented about 1/3 of the screenplay. </p>

<p>But life intervened and I never pursued the project further - despite always believing in it. Which brings us to Indiegogo. </p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 24px; background-color: initial;"">This campaign seeks to raise funds to create the 2nd (&amp; even 3rd) installment of the graphic novel which will be shopped to publishers - or self-published as an ebook (and potentially also a limited edition hard copy).</span><br/></p>
<div>
<p><b>So what's it about?</b> 'State's Evidence' is about Joe. Joe's an ex-con,  who was tangentially involved in a massacre of illegal immigrants years earlier by a white supremacist gang. Haunted by what happened, Joe turned state's evidence in order to put the key perpetrator in jail. Wanting to just quietly get on with his life in witness protection after serving his reduced sentence, he's coerced into infiltrating the gang, now run by the imprisoned leader's brother and plotting a comeback. His motivation? His old flame, Belle, is still associated with the group... and they have a son. Joe agrees to go undercover to save the son he never knew from the gang's destructive influence. (Plus, of course, he still holds a candle for his old flame...)</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">But aren't indie-published projects usually, you know... complete s**t?</span><br/></p>
<p>At some time or other, we've all bought something from someone without a track record. And we've all - at least once - been disappointed it didn't live up to our expectations. It's these experiences that make us wary of backing something new - whether it's buying a washing machine of an unknown brand or sampling a new author's work.</p>
<p>I can't <u>guarantee</u> this story will be for you. But I can assure you I'll use my twenty years' experience of writing for film &amp; TV - and teaching screenwriting - to give you the most gripping, entertaining story I can over 150-odd pages.</p>
</div>
</div><div>
<p>I wanted to ensure that this project stood out from the pack. That it would <u>enhance</u> the reputation of self-funded, indie comics, rather than diminish it. To this end, I assembled an awesome team to turn the story into a graphic novel. But these guys are professionals - this is what they do to pay their bills. Which is why I'm seeking funding to pay them. They are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<b>Giuseppe D'Elia:</b> Giuseppe is back to continue his awesome work taking my story and turning it into sequential art.

Salamoff</a>.</li>
<li>
<b>Mukesh Singh:</b> I came across Mukesh on-line and was blown away. I'd enjoyed Guy Ritchie's crime thriller <i><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Guy-Ritchies-Gamekeeper-Omnibus-SC/dp/160690177X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1405491613&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Guy+Ritchie%27s+The+Gamekeeper"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Gamekeeper</a></i>, (even sending it to Giuseppe as an example of what I was going for) never knowing who was responsible for the evocative art . Mukesh has come on board to provide covers for the first and second (and maybe third) installment of the graphic novel. Check out a few of his illustrations in the gallery or <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/mukeshsingh?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/mukeshsingh?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">go here for his facebook page</a> or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=dp_byline_sr_book_4?ie=UTF8&amp;field-author=Mukesh+Singh&amp;search-alias=books&amp;text=Mukesh+Singh&amp;sort=relevancerank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here for the work of his that's available on Amazon</a>.

By bringing Shawn on-board, Giuseppe is freed-up from doing the lettering, and can focus on the pencils, inks and coloring that he's already responsible for.  Shawn showed me the great work he's capable of when I commissioned him to do some lettering previously (see gallery). He also has a crowd-funding campaign on the go (on that <i>other</i> crowd-funding website...). It's called <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shawnwrites/the-galaxy-girls-graphic-novel"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Galaxy Girls and you can check it out here</a>. If one campaign's not enough to get involved with, then pop over to his campaign and give him some love, too!</li>

</div></div>","Who are you? What's State's Evidence and why the hell should I give you my money? I'm Alan Brash from Shoot First Productions in Auckland, New Zealand. My bio is here but in short, I'm a screenwriter, producer, development executive, writing tutor & film-maker with more than 20 years' experience in the film & TV industry. This is my first foray into comics and graphic novels. (If you've watched the video, you'll know that my place is definitely not  in front of the camera!)
State's Evidence is a crime thriller which started life as a feature film screenplay. It placed well in a couple of script competitions and a few years ago I came across Italian artist, Giuseppe D'Elia, on-line (when we found out we'd been ripped-off by the same scam artist!) We formed an awesome long-distance working relationship, powered by Skype and email, and created the first 52 pages of a full-color graphic novel, which represented about 1/3 of the screenplay. 

Page 1 of the graphic novel.
But life intervened and I never pursued the project further - despite always believing in it. Which brings us to Indiegogo. 
This campaign seeks to raise funds to create the 2nd (& even 3rd) installment of the graphic novel which will be shopped to publishers - or self-published as an ebook (and potentially also a limited edition hard copy).

So what's it about? 'State's Evidence' is about Joe. Joe's an ex-con,  who was tangentially involved in a massacre of illegal immigrants years earlier by a white supremacist gang. Haunted by what happened, Joe turned state's evidence in order to put the key perpetrator in jail. Wanting to just quietly get on with his life in witness protection after serving his reduced sentence, he's coerced into infiltrating the gang, now run by the imprisoned leader's brother and plotting a comeback. His motivation? His old flame, Belle, is still associated with the group... and they have a son. Joe agrees to go undercover to save the son he never knew from the gang's destructive influence. (Plus, of course, he still holds a candle for his old flame...)
But aren't indie-published projects usually, you know... complete s**t?
At some time or other, we've all bought something from someone without a track record. And we've all - at least once - been disappointed it didn't live up to our expectations. It's these experiences that make us wary of backing something new - whether it's buying a washing machine of an unknown brand or sampling a new author's work.
I can't guarantee this story will be for you. But I can assure you I'll use my twenty years' experience of writing for film & TV - and teaching screenwriting - to give you the most gripping, entertaining story I can over 150-odd pages.


I wanted to ensure that this project stood out from the pack. That it would enhance the reputation of self-funded, indie comics, rather than diminish it. To this end, I assembled an awesome team to turn the story into a graphic novel. But these guys are professionals - this is what they do to pay their bills. Which is why I'm seeking funding to pay them. They are:


Giuseppe D'Elia: Giuseppe is back to continue his awesome work taking my story and turning it into sequential art. I love the cinematic style of Giuseppe's work and he's proven to be a fantastic collaborator. Here are some examples of his work or check out the gallery. His recent work includes the sci-fi graphic novel Discord, written by film, TV and comics writer Paul J. Salamoff.

Mukesh Singh: I came across Mukesh on-line and was blown away. I'd enjoyed Guy Ritchie's crime thriller The Gamekeeper, (even sending it to Giuseppe as an example of what I was going for) never knowing who was responsible for the evocative art . Mukesh has come on board to provide covers for the first and second (and maybe third) installment of the graphic novel. Check out a few of his illustrations in the gallery or go here for his facebook page or here for the work of his that's available on Amazon. I promise you won't be disappointed!

Shawn Depasquale: Shawn is a writer in his own right (film, TV, comics), but he's also a highly experienced letterer. By bringing Shawn on-board, Giuseppe is freed-up from doing the lettering, and can focus on the pencils, inks and coloring that he's already responsible for.  Shawn showed me the great work he's capable of when I commissioned him to do some lettering previously (see gallery). He also has a crowd-funding campaign on the go (on that other crowd-funding website...). It's called The Galaxy Girls and you can check it out here. If one campaign's not enough to get involved with, then pop over to his campaign and give him some love, too!

But as a great war rages, the Kaiser is found dead, and one sister -- Giselle Grey -- is accused of his murder. Pursued by her enemies across the battlefields of Mitteleuropa Giselle must unravel the prophecy of the Carbon Grey -- before history itself unravels. 


Carbon Grey have been over eleven years in the making. This book meant so much to us and we wanted to do it justice by bringing all three volumes into one massive collection. Featuring gorgeous, fully-painted artwork throughout, Carbon Grey is an epic saga of honor, betrayal and redemption spanning generations. Includes all three volumes of the original series, stories from Carbon Grey: Origins, additional scenes and a new ten-page prologue.""Add On"" - We have a few items added, including, the ""Art of Carbon Grey"" - 128 pages Hardback in full colors. ""Memories Lost"" art book with slipcase, ""Carbon Grey Trading Cards"" collector set and a preview of ""Metal Militia"" comic, not available anywhere else. See more details here:

Here is scene from a ball room dance, one of a rare moment where we get to see Giselle and Mathilde in a dress. Notice how uncomfortable Giselle is (she wearing the red dress) Mathilde on the other hand is quite happy.


Below are the three volumes (wrap-around-covers) trade paper back we plan to collect into one massive volume. Over 300 pages of excitement!

Risks and challenges
We successfully completed our last three campaigns and delivered all rewards. We feel confident that we can do it again, but with any project, there are certain risks that will arise.
We have plans in placed that will mitigate these issues, however there are factors that are beyond our control, like manufacturing scheduling.
We're now using multiple toy manufactures to better schedule various products. Hopefully this will prevent delays in getting the rewards to you.
We learned a great deal from our previous three campaigns and feel confident that we'll manage any problem should it arise.
Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions or concerns.",23.0,0,"1 Campaign

This new imprint is completely independent from the Amryl Universe, and will offer a different, darker take on the Cavewoman character as well as explore the new shared universe with Razor and the returning London Night universe of characters that will soon be relaunching as well under Amryl Dark. This ""parallel world"" will be darker, the tales will be bigger, and the stories &amp; characters will connect in exciting new ways. Amryl Dark will change the status quo, but unlike most reboots we will not be throwing out the existing history of Cavewoman or Razor, but rather building upon what is already established  and taking that in a new and exciting direction. You are in for a wild ride with Amryl Dark Entertainment!</p><p> </p><p><strong>Meet the Amryl Dark Entertainment team:</strong></p><p><strong>Dave Kopecki – Writer &amp; Editor</strong></p><p><strong>Andrew Mangum – Artist &amp; Art Director</strong></p><p><strong>McLain McGuire – Lettering &amp; Graphics   </strong></p><p><strong>Kevin Alsop - Publisher</strong></p><p><i>The Amryl Dark imprint is overseen and managed by Dave Kopecki as the Writer &amp; Editor of the line, Andrew Mangum handles the art and oversees Art Direction for the entire line, and McLain McGuire handles all the lettering, graphics, and design.</i></p><p><i>We three independently produce and deliver the finished product to the publisher at Amryl Entertainment, who prints and distributes the books for us under our imprint. We do not even solicit our books until they are already completed so that we always deliver as promised. As such, our books will be released as a series of one-shots or miniseries rather than regular monthly comic books.</i></p><p> </p><p><strong>OUR MISSION:</strong></p><p>Our goal is to deliver fun, '90s-style comic books! We love how comics used to be in the '90s heyday, as opposed to the more traditional modern storytelling in comics that are ""written for trade"" and that slowly build over 6 issues or more to tell a story. Each series we do will be a 1 or 2-issue self contained story while also part of the larger whole of an interconnected universe.</p><p> </p><p><strong>OUR SOCIAL MEDIA:</strong></p><p>Check us out on the following pages!</p><p><strong>Amryl Dark Entertainment has its own Facebook page</strong> - <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/amryldarkentertainment"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/amryldarkentertainment</a> </p><p><strong>Cavewoman Comics also has its own Facebook page</strong> - <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/cavewomancomics"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/cavewomancomics</a> </p><p><strong>Follow Amryl Entertainment on Twitter</strong> - <a href=""https://twitter.com/amrylent"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://twitter.com/amrylent</a></p><p><strong>Follow Amryl Entertainment on Instagram</strong> - <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/amrylent/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.instagram.com/amrylent/</a></p></div>","Amryl Dark Entertainment returns to Indiegogo with the exciting followup to our last successful campaign here for Cavewoman: Metal Age #1!

Eventually making it to the castle of Lord Heinous, General of the Armies of Limbo, they manage to sneak inside and spy on Lord Heinous and even Malevolence herself before all hell breaks loose! Now they must fight their way through an army of demons and the evil General himself! Meriem is about to learn just why these monsters are the Lords of Limbo! Much blood will be shed and it quickly goes from a fight to the death to a race for their lives.

This new imprint is completely independent from the Amryl Universe, and will offer a different, darker take on the Cavewoman character as well as explore the new shared universe with Razor and the returning London Night universe of characters that will soon be relaunching as well under Amryl Dark. This ""parallel world"" will be darker, the tales will be bigger, and the stories & characters will connect in exciting new ways. Amryl Dark will change the status quo, but unlike most reboots we will not be throwing out the existing history of Cavewoman or Razor, but rather building upon what is already established  and taking that in a new and exciting direction. You are in for a wild ride with Amryl Dark Entertainment! Meet the Amryl Dark Entertainment team:Dave Kopecki – Writer & EditorAndrew Mangum – Artist & Art DirectorMcLain McGuire – Lettering & Graphics   Kevin Alsop - PublisherThe Amryl Dark imprint is overseen and managed by Dave Kopecki as the Writer & Editor of the line, Andrew Mangum handles the art and oversees Art Direction for the entire line, and McLain McGuire handles all the lettering, graphics, and design.We three independently produce and deliver the finished product to the publisher at Amryl Entertainment, who prints and distributes the books for us under our imprint. We do not even solicit our books until they are already completed so that we always deliver as promised. As such, our books will be released as a series of one-shots or miniseries rather than regular monthly comic books. OUR MISSION:Our goal is to deliver fun, '90s-style comic books! We love how comics used to be in the '90s heyday, as opposed to the more traditional modern storytelling in comics that are ""written for trade"" and that slowly build over 6 issues or more to tell a story. Each series we do will be a 1 or 2-issue self contained story while also part of the larger whole of an interconnected universe. OUR SOCIAL MEDIA:Check us out on the following pages!Amryl Dark Entertainment has its own Facebook page - https://www.facebook.com/amryldarkentertainment Cavewoman Comics also has its own Facebook page - https://www.facebook.com/cavewomancomics Follow Amryl Entertainment on Twitter - https://twitter.com/amrylentFollow Amryl Entertainment on Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/amrylent/",31.0,3,"3 Campaigns

<p>Following up on successful publishing campaigns for the <a href=""https://www.wahprods.com/collections/shop/products/p-craig-russell-sketchbook-archives"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>P. Craig Russell Sketchbook Archives</i></a> and a trio of <a href=""https://www.wahprods.com/collections/shop"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Fine Art Editions</i>,</a> we're proud to announce the pre-order campaign for our <i>fifth</i> hardcover art book—<i>101 Drawings by P. Craig Russell!</i></p>
<p>This oversized 12x12 inch hardcover features the crème de la crème of P. Craig Russell's black and white illustrations from the past 45-47 years—carefully chosen by the artist himself and presented in chronological order. The book also includes a number of all-new images that will be appearing in print for the very first time. Each and every book purchased via this campaign will be personally signed by P. Craig Russell!  The book is expected to be approximately 112-120 pages.</p>
<p>P. CRAIG RUSSELL: ""I think artists especially like seeing the work in black and white—the line work before color is added. It gives it another dimension and it’s just fun to see. In addition to a carefully curated collection of vintage illustrations, the book will include recent pieces that we’ve done for our crowdfunding adventures over the past few years, various commissions that were created as original art rewards. Also, all of the new black and white squares that I’ve done this year—I’ve just finished the 7th one—will be seen for the very first time. I haven’t counted yet, but I would say that out of 101 drawings, a good 25-30% are pieces that haven’t seen print before.""</p>

<h3>Purgcomic.com</h3>
<p>Help me make my second book and put my two books to print. Purg is a horror/cyberpunk comic.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, I am J Murrin, a Canadian freelance illustrator and Comic book artist. </p>
<p>Purg is my original story, I write, ink, and paint it all, and I need your help to bring my story into the world.</p>
<p>It has been a dream of mine to tell this story in comic format for years.  I completed book 1 which is viewable for free online <a href=""http://www.purgcomic.com,"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.purgcomic.com</a> , there is also a .cbr file you can download on the page to view it anywhere. Warning: mature viewers suggested. </p>
<p>Help me make this dream come true and get this book made and printed.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My goal is to self publish and distribute 500 hundreds of copies each of book 1 and 2 in full color front to back.  As well as have time and resources to make it happen in a reasonable amount of time.  Any contribution is appreciated, even if it's just spreading the word about my comic.  Any contribution will get a big thank you and a shout out on twitter and facebook (unless you wish to be annonymous).  See the perks bellow that you'll recieve in addition to that.  The first X amount of books are free to download in .cbr format on my webpage, so anyone is welcome to them regardless of donation.</p>

<h3>What is Purg?</h3>
<p>Purg is set in 2040, in a city that the kids nicknamed 'Purg' out of mutual hatred for it. The world is a dark cyberpunk dystopia full of wondrous and/or terrifying technology, psychotic deceitful global corporations, riots in the overcrowded cities and marauders raping and pillaging rural areas. The rich sit in their well secured zones looking down on a city full of the lower class; those not homeless and starving in the streets are sitting in their shoddy homes hard wired into the ether, escaping the horrors of the world around them.</p>
<p>Something stranger and darker exists unknown to the common person - practitioners of black magic, terrifying suicide and chaos cults, secret societies, and creatures of nightmares. This story follows a gang of ""malc"" (malcontent) teens who, during their foolish but amusing adventures, discover that there is more to the world around them, bizarre and terrible things, things even worse than humans.</p>

What is Purg?
Purg is set in 2040, in a city that the kids nicknamed 'Purg' out of mutual hatred for it. The world is a dark cyberpunk dystopia full of wondrous and/or terrifying technology, psychotic deceitful global corporations, riots in the overcrowded cities and marauders raping and pillaging rural areas. The rich sit in their well secured zones looking down on a city full of the lower class; those not homeless and starving in the streets are sitting in their shoddy homes hard wired into the ether, escaping the horrors of the world around them.
Something stranger and darker exists unknown to the common person - practitioners of black magic, terrifying suicide and chaos cults, secret societies, and creatures of nightmares. This story follows a gang of ""malc"" (malcontent) teens who, during their foolish but amusing adventures, discover that there is more to the world around them, bizarre and terrible things, things even worse than humans.

<p>So here's the deal:</p>
<p>As you may know, I have been touring overseas doing comedy. I did well at the Edinburgh Fringe last year, and since then I have been working tirelessly. Its been a blast, but its taken a lot of energy, sacrifice &amp; hard work.

<p>The DVD:</p>

<p>The funds that we are raising are to help bring our first FULL length issue into the world! Last year we successfully funded, via another online funding site, our first preview issue, where we introduced you to the amazing women of Chunky Girl Comics- Rosie, Candy, Sweet Pea &amp; Sage. Now, the story has been set and it's time for these chunky and beautiful super heroes to show you what they can REALLY do!</p>
<p>The money raised via IndieGoGo, will ensure that the artwork, the printing and the availability of this comic book will be the same high quality of standards that were met with the Preview Issue #0. Every little bit helps! And the more we raise, the more availability we'll have! Thank you for your support!  Below is our press release, for some background information about me and Chunky Girl Comics.</p>
<p>Chunky Girl Comics is breaking down barriers and introducing the world of comics to Rosie, Sage, Sweet Pea and Candy, a group of ladies with curves in all of the right places that are determined to break the standards of what a typical superhero should look like.</p>
<p>Chunky Girl Comics is a small, independent organization based in Stockton, California comprised of husband and wife team, Jose and Marisa Garcia. A destined union at first meeting, Jose is the ever talented artist who continues to build his abilities in various mediums and Marisa, who cannot even draw a stick figure, is the creativemind behind the Heavy Response Unit and Chunky Girl Comics other creative projects. Both Garcia’s are lovers of comic art, both new and classic and after a few years of talking about starting a project together, it was in 2011 that Marisa and Jose decided to make their dreams of bringing their overweight superheroes to life and put pen to paper. With the huge help of their good friend, Grant Miller (who does the digital images and colors), the preview issue of the Heavy Response Unit was completed and made available to the public on August 5, 2012 at the Stockton-Con convention at the University of Pacific.</p>
<p><em>“I am a proud overweight woman who loves comic book art. But it was so hard to actually relate to any of the characters because no one that I’ve ever met looks like any of those women,”</em> stated Marisa, <em>“It was time to have characters that looked like me, had the same issues as me.” </em></p>
<p>The Heavy Response Unit storyline follows four friends who go from being happy, well adjusted, overweight women in Northern California to having to fight for equality when it essentially becomes illegal to be overweight in America. Not only are the girls curvy, but they are all of different ethnic backgrounds.</p>
<p><em>“It is so fun to write these characters because they are all so different and so strong in their own ways. They go from being confident and comfortable with their bodies to being shunned and forced into hiding. It’s basically an exaggerated take on what society has done to plus size women in the real world. I want anyone, no matter their size or race, to be able to look at these girls and find themselves in one of them,” </em>commented Marisa.</p>
<p>Jose and Marisa have completed their first preview issue which introduces readers to the girls and begins to tease about what is to come. Stories are written and ideas are flowing and more products are being created in whatever spare time they can muster. Jose and Marisa have two beautiful children, Olivia, 8 and Dominic, 6. Most of their days are spent doing laundry, going to soccer and baseball practices, helping with homework, attending violin recitals and taking care of their three dogs, Manny, Oscar and Abby. But occasionally on weekends you will find the Garcia’s at comic conventions all over California sharing their comic book, stickers, prints and bracelets with comic lovers.</p>
<p>Future projects for Chunky Girl Comics include an anti-bullying children’s book illustrated by Miss Olivia Garcia, a Chunky Boys line and the ultimate goal is to have the Heavy Response Unit transformed into a cartoon.</p>
<p><em>“Our dream is to bring awareness to how bullying and singling out differences effects everyone, not just children. We love to celebrate women, men and children of all sizes and show that despite size and having a little extra padding, we can do all that everyone else can do!”</em>, said Marisa, passionately<em>. “We believe that the world of comics and cartoons are ready for this story, for these women. The feedback we’ve gotten over the last year has been extremely positive and we will keep pushing and pushing until Sage, Candy, Rosie and Sweet Pea have their place at the top! Fierce. Fab. Fluffy! Who says superheroes have to be skinny!?” </em></p>

<h3>Waitasec? Didn't you just do a Kickstarter ?</h3>
<p>Yessir! We successfully ran a campaign for <b><a href=""http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1455635042/kung-fu-skratch-2-a-martial-arts-manga-mixtape"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">KFS! Issue 2</a></b> that ended on September 29th.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Yo! <span style=""letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">So why do another crowdfunder ?</span>
</h3>Due to the success of the previous campaign, we've decided to extend it via Indiegogo for anyone who missed it or back only on Indiegogo. Also, I believe we can reach some more goals (like extending the pages and getting Issue 3 funded) to make KFS! the best comic as much as possible.<br/><p></p>

<p>Essentially a teen comedy, martial arts, and action comic, <strong><em>Kung Fu Skratch!</em></strong> is a love letter to comics,manga,martial arts, hip-hop culture, gaming, and a little bit of other things that I grew up with (you'll catch a ton of references within the comic). <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p> Kung Fu Skratch! (also known as KFS!: Welcome 2 Brickhaven EP) is a black and white (with tones), six-issue, 22-24 page comic book mini-series, self-published (if we can't find a publisher within the timeframe) and distributed digitally on <strong><em><a href=""http://www.comixology.com/KUNG-FU-SKRATCH-1/digital-comic/SUB000081"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Comixology</a></em></strong>.</p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Along with wanting make a kickass martial arts comic, I truly wanted to positively introduce a diverse cast of characters of multiple ethnic and cultural backgrounds - - each of them representing the melting pot of American (if not the world) culture. </span><br/></p>
<p>Hip-Hop as a worldwide movement is the type of lifestyle that transcends race, religion, gender, and nationalities - - at its peak can bring people all over the world together. It also is about competition, swagger, and a rebelliousness! </p>
<p>Hopefully in reading the book, the reader can find characters and stories that they can either relate to and identify with.</p>

<p>With the production and completion of Issue 1 during the year, I learned comics are fun to make but also very expensive and stressful without any type of support; especially when you are working on a independent comic and self-publishing it yourself. Through crowdfunding, I was able to fulfil my lifelong dream to create and publish a comic of my own and share it with others. The funds donated to this campaign will go towards payment for the publishing, production, and expenses towards the creative team. </p>

""If issue #1 and early peeks at issue #2 are any indication, Mr. Engman and crew plan on maintaining a standard of excellence that can only help this title to become a fan favorite. Check it out, it’s a read that’s well worth it!"" - Mark Turner from The Examiner.com

Waitasec? Didn't you just do a Kickstarter ?
Yessir! We successfully ran a campaign for KFS! Issue 2 that ended on September 29th.

Yo! So why do another crowdfunder ?
Due to the success of the previous campaign, we've decided to extend it via Indiegogo for anyone who missed it or back only on Indiegogo. Also, I believe we can reach some more goals (like extending the pages and getting Issue 3 funded) to make KFS! the best comic as much as possible.



""We learn martial arts as helping weakness. You never fight for people to get hurt. You're always helping people.""  - Jackie Chan 

Essentially a teen comedy, martial arts, and action comic, Kung Fu Skratch! is a love letter to comics,manga,martial arts, hip-hop culture, gaming, and a little bit of other things that I grew up with (you'll catch a ton of references within the comic). .

 Kung Fu Skratch! (also known as KFS!: Welcome 2 Brickhaven EP) is a black and white (with tones), six-issue, 22-24 page comic book mini-series, self-published (if we can't find a publisher within the timeframe) and distributed digitally on Comixology.



Along with wanting make a kickass martial arts comic, I truly wanted to positively introduce a diverse cast of characters of multiple ethnic and cultural backgrounds - - each of them representing the melting pot of American (if not the world) culture. 
Hip-Hop as a worldwide movement is the type of lifestyle that transcends race, religion, gender, and nationalities - - at its peak can bring people all over the world together. It also is about competition, swagger, and a rebelliousness! 
Hopefully in reading the book, the reader can find characters and stories that they can either relate to and identify with.

Aimed to teens and adults. KFS! is inspired by video games, movies,comics and animated series like Double Dragon, Streets of Rage, Final Fight, 2-D and 3-D Fighting games (ie: KOF, TEKKEN, SF) Barry Gordy's The Last Dragon, Sharknife, Kung Fu Hustle, the Scott Pilgrim series, Ranma 1/2,Samurai Champloo, Tenjo Tenge, Black Dynamite, and River City Ransom! 
What's different about the (re) release of physical copy of Issue 1 is that it'll be a Director's Cut. It will have 8-12 pages of bonus material including behind the scenes materials including character information, developmental art, sketches, script excerpts, among other things and will only be available via this campaign.


It's the story of Jason Stonewall, a teenage martial artist who has returned to the United States after training in the East for a year. Back in his hometown of Brickhaven, Jason's about start his his first freshman day of high school to run into the school's reigning tyrant, Fa'Sho! 
Now Jason must use his righteous fists of fury to take down the Gangsta Bancho and his gang, The Sho'Gunnz in a battle that will crack the school in half!

Kung Fu Skratch! is written and created by Adrian Engmann, and is his first creator owned comics project. Issue 2's interior art is provided by the returning Erwin Prasetya (BLADE BUNNY, MONSUNO), and  Dong Zhang (SUPERNOVAS) and Steve ""Kandoken"" Mack. Frank Cvetkovic (MOLLY DANGER, ARTFUL DAGGERS) is on letters while Andeh Pinkard (MEGAMAIDEN, PANTY BRIGADE, SHONEN PUNK!) on design duties. 
Each and every one of the these guys are creative and help to bring the world of Kung Fu Skratch! to life and I, for one am fortunate to collaborate with. We're putting all we've got on in this book and hopefully it shows to you, the reader!

With the production and completion of Issue 1 during the year, I learned comics are fun to make but also very expensive and stressful without any type of support; especially when you are working on a independent comic and self-publishing it yourself. Through crowdfunding, I was able to fulfil my lifelong dream to create and publish a comic of my own and share it with others. The funds donated to this campaign will go towards payment for the publishing, production, and expenses towards the creative team.

My name is Nick Brand. I have been illustrating cartoons and comics for several years now. I've spent a lot of time writing stories and perfecting my art style, and now, I feel I'm ready to share a story I've been writing for over ten years. I call this story ""Spike Storm""</p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><font size=""5""><span style=""line-height: 30px;""><b><br/>What is ""Spike Storm""?</b></span></font></span><p></p><p>More like WHO is Spike Storm, however this question works too. Spike Storm centers around a teenage boy named Nicky Callaghan, who lives with his family in the city of Happydale. Their apartment actually doubles as a comic book store!</p><p>Everything was going normally for Nicky until he snuck into a weapons demonstration with the help of his best friend Axel. The demonstration was going well until the experimental weapon started going haywire, forcing everyone in the area to evacuate. Nicky was accidentally hit by the special energy surging from the experiment and was knocked out cold. </p><p>He woke up in a hospital and eventually found out that he wasn't the same “normal” boy anymore. Now lightning shoots from his hands, he has the power to control and manipulate plasma, he can run faster, jump higher, think and react to things quicker than any human being!</p><p>After quickly getting used to these abilities, he decides that with Axel's help, he will don on the name Spike Storm, and fight the criminals that plague Happydale.</p><p>However, he soon finds out that fighting petty criminals is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to creating a super powered secret identity. He must overcome villains far more powerful than him, tend to his normal life responsibilities, maintain his new relationship with his girlfriend Meredith, and protect the innocent at all costs, all while making sure nobody discovers his secret.<br/></p><h3>
<br/>Meet Spike Storm!<br/><br/>
</h3><p>Many of you guys asked for a more detailed description of the main character, so here it is!<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/595997/files/20140521193925-shocking_by_sonofadj617-d7fotej.jpg?1400726365"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; width: 275.1285930408472px; height: 420px; background-color: initial;""/> <br/><br/>As mentioned above, Nicky Callaghan is a 16 year old nerd, and living in a comic book store that sells things from movies, video games and comic books definitely play a big factor in his love for these things. Nicky is a kind hearted individual, and keeps to himself, especially when he's pushed around by the bullies at his school. He usually hands out wisecracks and puns when he can. However, when under pressure, he can be very close minded, and can have a very hard time coming up with a solution to a problem.<br/><br/>This all changes when he gets involved with the lab accident that gives him his powers. His remarkable reaction time and improved thinking speed, while doesn't make him intelligent, does help rectify his former disability to handle situations while under stress. <br/><br/>Nicky's powers also have a small side effect. Due to his faster thinking, his mind creates a second consciousness that can think on its own. It causes Nicky to hallucinate, and can see it manifest in things like mirrors and reflections in the form of Nicky himself. It talks to him and usually offers a voice of reason. Or just insults him, either way, it's here to stay!<br/><br/>When Nicky finally dons on the super hero name ""Spike Storm"", he is usually challenged with a powerful villain. Spike Storm is strong, but his villains are stronger, MUCH stronger.

Or if you would like to help cover the shipping costs all together, please contact me!Quick Note* This page will have more images and previews to come! Including a short few pages to show how the final product should look!Short SummaryHey there! My name is Nick Brand. I have been illustrating cartoons and comics for several years now. I've spent a lot of time writing stories and perfecting my art style, and now, I feel I'm ready to share a story I've been writing for over ten years. I call this story ""Spike Storm""What is ""Spike Storm""?More like WHO is Spike Storm, however this question works too. Spike Storm centers around a teenage boy named Nicky Callaghan, who lives with his family in the city of Happydale. Their apartment actually doubles as a comic book store!Everything was going normally for Nicky until he snuck into a weapons demonstration with the help of his best friend Axel. The demonstration was going well until the experimental weapon started going haywire, forcing everyone in the area to evacuate. Nicky was accidentally hit by the special energy surging from the experiment and was knocked out cold. He woke up in a hospital and eventually found out that he wasn't the same “normal” boy anymore. Now lightning shoots from his hands, he has the power to control and manipulate plasma, he can run faster, jump higher, think and react to things quicker than any human being!After quickly getting used to these abilities, he decides that with Axel's help, he will don on the name Spike Storm, and fight the criminals that plague Happydale.However, he soon finds out that fighting petty criminals is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to creating a super powered secret identity. He must overcome villains far more powerful than him, tend to his normal life responsibilities, maintain his new relationship with his girlfriend Meredith, and protect the innocent at all costs, all while making sure nobody discovers his secret.
Meet Spike Storm!
Many of you guys asked for a more detailed description of the main character, so here it is! As mentioned above, Nicky Callaghan is a 16 year old nerd, and living in a comic book store that sells things from movies, video games and comic books definitely play a big factor in his love for these things. Nicky is a kind hearted individual, and keeps to himself, especially when he's pushed around by the bullies at his school. He usually hands out wisecracks and puns when he can. However, when under pressure, he can be very close minded, and can have a very hard time coming up with a solution to a problem.This all changes when he gets involved with the lab accident that gives him his powers. His remarkable reaction time and improved thinking speed, while doesn't make him intelligent, does help rectify his former disability to handle situations while under stress. Nicky's powers also have a small side effect. Due to his faster thinking, his mind creates a second consciousness that can think on its own. It causes Nicky to hallucinate, and can see it manifest in things like mirrors and reflections in the form of Nicky himself. It talks to him and usually offers a voice of reason. Or just insults him, either way, it's here to stay!When Nicky finally dons on the super hero name ""Spike Storm"", he is usually challenged with a powerful villain. Spike Storm is strong, but his villains are stronger, MUCH stronger. So Spike Storm will usually have to rely on his wits and other means besides his newfound strength to take down villains that range from a ""living computer avatar"", ""a crazy homicidal scientist with god like powers"", ""a powerful mob boss with the strength to crush a human skull in his hands"" to even ""a rage induced cyborg from another dimension"".Can he handle it all? You'll have to help make this project a success to find out!Supporting CastAxel Smith: Nicky's best friend and mechanical genius.

<h3>About Sean Eike</h3>
Thank you for taking the time to view my project!<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am an illustrator from Des Moines, Iowa. After getting a Graphic Design and Fine Arts degree from Grand View College (now Grand View University) in 2003, I decided that the world of corporate or industrial design was not for me. So I signed up for a crash-course year at The Kubert School in Dover, New Jersey and found my love for comic book art.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For the better part of 10 years I worked on projects that did not have much recognition or that I did not receive credit for. After the death of my hero, Joe Kubert in August of 2012, I decided to take my career into my own hands. So I started work on my series ""Rocket Transfer's Secret Files""... a series that is print-on-demand with Black and White artwork.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>

<p>You may ask what happens if the $25,000 goal is not met? Fear not. I will find a way to get this book made and all of the perks will be sent to the gracious donors.

Please help me take the next step in my independent comic book career!</p>

I may have to cut corners but I can say for sure that without the $25,000 I will be back to square one on my next project from the standpoint of being able to reach new audiences. Please help me take the next step in my independent comic book career!




Other Ways You Can Help
My friends, I know that it is not possible for everyone to give money. There are many ways that you can help!



Tell your friends and family about this project! Let them know the importance of independent comic books!
Use the resources of Indiegogo to spread the word!
Use social media to direct people to this page!
Talk to your local comic book shop owners and ask if you can put up information!

Any help.... ANY help is greatly appreciated. Thank you so much for your time!

If the goal is not reached, everyone will be refunded and this edition will not be printed, but ... it would be sad, no?The perksPlease, read carefully what exactly is included in the perks. As some of them are including a donation, they might offer less according to their price.- Eternal thanks: Your name will be listed in the thanks section of the book and in the website, for ever! (In every of my Devlok's autoproductions). - The book: Like indicated upper, it's 56 pages, 21x30cm / 8,3x11,7 inch format, 200gr Paper and 300gr. soft cover. - Dedication: Small color drawing in the book, signed.- Ex-Libris (Bookplate): Small sheet of nice paper with a thick ink stamped Devlok. Signed.- Poster A3: (42x30cm - 16,5x11,8 inch) 300gr. Paper. Signed  (It will not be possible to choose, probably it'll be this one)​- Poster A2: 200gr. Paper. Signed. (No picture available yet)- Printed Bookmark (7x25cm / 2,7x9,8 inch). Signed. (No picture available yet)- Illustrated Bookmark (7x25cm / 2,7x9,8 inch). Yes, it's a real original illustration. And it's Signed of course.​​*Obviously bookmarks with original illustrations are all different, this one is an example commissioned by a fan.Notes:*Every perk include shipping costs wordwide.*I will probably make a new cover for the book.*There might be small differences between the pictures and the final product.You can't participate?Legit! Still, talking and sharing this page with your friends will make you earn some extra Karma points!Also, keep an eye on Haedre Fb's page, I will probably launch a contest to win free copies!The authorI was born in the french part of Belgium in 81. Very early, masters of science fiction like Giger, Moebius, Druillet, Otomo, Shirow, Nihei and many many more influenced me a lot. Later, I also produced electronic music which somehow converged perfectly towards my obsessions of machines and cables. And because I am connected to this field, I did a bunch of commissionned illustrations for technoish records.Today, I live in Berlin, Germany.​If you want to know/see more, I invite you to visit my pages:http://haedre.comhttp://facebook.com/haedrearthttp://facebook.com/vonkor-labThank you for your visit!",32.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>My name is Regine L. Sawyer and I am the owner of Lockett Down Productions Publications as well as the writer and creator of the comic book""The Rippers"". The story is about an intergalactic bounty hunter, who works for a government agency whose sole purpose is to disassemble all factions of a criminal organization. In the mist of doing that, she gets accused of a crime she doesn't remember commiting.</p>
<p>I love writing this series. It's my baby. Nuturing it since 1997, it was my pleasure and honor to debut it to the public at last year's New York Anime Festival. And it was overwhelming to receive so much support at the convention, as well as conventions since then, especially from female comic book readers. The success of this project will prove that comic books with a female lead can bridge gaps, as well as encourage even more female readership without snubbing the industry staple of male readers.   </p>
<p>As the owner of a fledgling comic book company it's a challenge promoting The Rippers on a small budget, and that's where I need your help. $3,000.00 is the amount I need to suppliment book, poster, and flyer costs for up coming conventions such as: the New York Comic Con/Anime Festival and the San Diego International Comic Con.  To thank you all for your support I have an awesome list rewards that include tickets to a much anticipated Comic Con, Personalized Pin-Ups drawn by one of my featured artists, Gift Cards from a famous Comic Book Store in New York City, and more!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I want to thank everyone in advance for all your help! And please, tell your friends, family, co-workers, and aquiantences about my company and this site. When something comes along as good as this project, you have to pass the word, don't keep it to yourself! Again I thank you!</p></div>","Our Story

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Christina, and for the last few years I've run the blog ""Dragons, Zombies &amp; Aliens,"" which review books and movies with a critical feminist lens.</p>
<p>They say write what you want to read. I want to read sci-fi and fantasy stories with powerful women, with lands that are not based off of Medieval Europe, with ugly truths and burning hope. I've managed to get a few short stories and novellas published with traditional publishing companies. But this time, I want to try something a little different: self-publish a graphic novel series.</p>
<p>Of course, this will not be possible without an illustrator, editor, or marketing. That's where I need your help. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In May, I'll be running a crowdfund campaign for $10K (subject to change). Most of that will go to the illustrator, a little will go to the editor, and a little more for production.</p>
<p>This campaign for $700 is for preliminary marketing. We need to get the word out! That means commissioning more posters from our fabulous illustrator, hitting social media, guests posts and advertising, etc. </p>
<p>In return, you'll get a variety of perks. A free, signed copy of the graphic novel itself, sneak peaks of character designs and scenes, and you might even get a character named after you!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I'm not going to lie: I have never self-published before. (Before this month, I've never done a crowdfund campaign before!) </p>
<p>So to work the kinks out and ensure ""Sovadron"" doesn't fall flat on its face, I'll first be self-publishing two smaller pieces: a collection of short stories and a novella. They'll be perks for the larger May campaign. </p>
<p>While I have plenty of experience writing stories and traditional books, this is also my first time writing a graphic novel. Luckily my illustrator, John Hawkins, does have experience, which is why he's worth all the money I'm raising. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The goal for this campaign is set at $1200. As the artwork is entirely complete, I plan to use any funds raised to specifically get the darn thing printed as well as a few swag-like items like stickers, high-end prints, t-shirts, eight-foot-tall Chloroplast standees, you know...as one does.</p>
<p>The reward tiers are hopefully geared towards expressing my sincere appreciation for every positive comment of encouragement this project has received.

</div></div>","I Fratelli Blasteroid
presentano: il più terrificante horror di retro-fantascienza mai realizzato a
fumetti!THE SHADOW PLANET è il quarto progetto, dopo il successo di ""Rim
City"", ""Quebrada - Seconda caduta"" e di ""Zeroi"",
dell'etichetta indipendente RADIUM. Un film a fumetti di 80 pagine a colori, formato comic book, per rivivere il brivido dell’orrore cosmico creato
da H.P. Lovecraft in
un’ambientazione di retro-fantascienza alla “Pianeta Proibito”. Razzi, bulloni, scafandri spaziali e pianeti
alieni non sono mai stati più spaventosi… e sexy!Firmano questo cocktail di retro-SF, exploitation e horror i
Blasteroid Bros, il collettivo
creativo formato dallo sceneggiatore Giovanni ""James"" Barbieri, dal
disegnatore Gianluca ""Johnny"" Pagliarani e dal colorista Alan ""Junior""
D'Amico. A controllare che i fratellini facciano tutto per bene c’è l’Editor ospite Stefano Vietti,
creatore con Luca Enoch di Dragonero,
il celebre fantasy di Sergio Bonelli Editore.
RADIUM è orgogliosa di offrire ai suoi affezionati funders
questa eccitante storia in due sontuose edizioni stampate, piene di contenuti
extra esclusivi e arricchite dalle
copertine di due superstar del fumetto: Mario
Alberti e Jacen Burrows! La vicenda inizia quando l’astronave Vidar del Comando Stellare
riceve un debole segnale di SOS proveniente da un pianeta disabitato.
Il comandante Jenna Scott sbarca con una pattuglia e trova i
resti di una precedente spedizione scientifica, misteriosamente scomparsa. 
Qualcuno o qualcosa, però, inizia a uccidere… è solo
l’inizio di una terrificante lotta per la sopravvivenza che svelerà lo
sconvolgente segreto di THE SHADOW PLANET!IL CASTJenna ScottIl comandante Scott può sembrare solo un bel bocconcino, ma
sa come farsi obbedire e risolvere ogni situazione... finché non atterra su THE
SHADOW PLANET.
John VargoIl sergente Vargo ha brutte abitudini e un pessimo
comportamento. Dovrà combattere fino all’ultimo per sopravvivere su THE SHADOW
PLANET.
Nikke LarssonIl luogotenente Larsson è un ottimo ufficiale alle
comunicazioni, ma resterà senza parole davanti all'orrore di THE SHADOW PLANET.

<p>‘Anubis: Dog of Death’ is an action comedy series about the Egyptian god of death. While once a powerful being, this comic sees him reduced to a tiny purse-dog due to how few people believe in him. All gods need believers to stay powerful. This <span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">comic sees Anubis meet many other gods from different religions, in similarly degenerated forms.</span></p>

While once a powerful being, this comic sees him reduced to a tiny purse-dog due to how few people believe in him. All gods need believers to stay powerful. This comic sees Anubis meet many other gods from different religions, in similarly degenerated forms.
Each issue has 24 story pages + the cover + pages for summaries, backer rewards & credits.
The comic is written by me (SindrElf), and drawn by John Barry Ballaran.
 


 
Both issues have already been funded through Kickstarter, and John has finished almost all the art needed for issue #2.
I wanted to see if there's anyone interested in the comic on this platform, before we're ready to send it to print. Any additional funding we acquire can go toward funding issue #3.
 
 
Issue #1 - Standard cover in the middle stack. Limited edition cover for #1 is now unavailable.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey there! the Hush anthology came about from a group of friends desire to create a zine. I reached out on social media and found that a lot of people were interested in producing short term comics on a deadline that would help them stay focused. The Hush anthology currently counts over 50 artists under our umbrella and is signed with Nerdantix comics. This fundraiser will help us launch a website for hosting our work and also allow us to print our own books to distribute and also give to our artists.</p>

<strong>GOALS FOR THIS CAMPAIGN</strong><ul>
<li>Raise enough to print a decent amount of books to be sold at conventions and comic book stores locally ( also to give to our artists and contributors)</li>
<li>Create a website where our artists have an easy, convenient way to display their work.</li>
<li>Introduce new artists to our project.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<strong>THE VISION</strong><p>   This project is meant to create a support system of artists, and also a base for many people to get their work noticed or in print. We plan to take this project past volume one and volume two and eventually expand to specific cities and themes as our focus. Money was never a factor in the creation of this anthology, so many of our friends and artists worked for free, because they enjoy it, I do believe they deserve all the support and to see their work in print.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Anthology was created by: 12 artists, sketched in one month, inked and finished in three. This was a challenge for many involved but they still all finished on a deadline.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest risk we have is not meeting a high enough goal to print books. We need at least two grand to print enough books for backers and our needs. We are going through Printninja because the samples we've seen look amazing.</p>
<p>Challenges may also include delays in shipping, printing or website launch. Everything is anticipated in spring of 2018.</p>

Hi everyone !!
What the heck is LIBERIA ??

 Well, it's 99 and 44/100% dead, lots of dead, plus a huge lot of heat, blood and sweat. LIBERIA is a total immersion  in a world filled with dangers and fears! A world in which a team of bad-asses mercenaries will try to survive chaos in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Hired by a shady company based in north Liberia, colonel Greg BLASZCZYK – leader of the Blaszczyk Division (D.B.)- has to come up with a plan for a mission involving the rescue of a scientist from an entire hostile city. His team is somewhat unorthodox, the main characters being an autistic orphan, an ex free fighter and an aristocratic sniper, but their skills compensate widely. Will the plan come together?
Loosely based on reality (corruption, poverty, high mortality rate in this part of the world), the plot mixes horror, action, humor and emotion. LIBERIA thrives to become a huge hit among other frangas.
What's this CheeseMonkey Studio ?°_°?

Basically, we are a franga production studio. Our design aesthetic borrows respectfully from the Japanese manga style designs(black and white, dynamics...), but adds a bunch of westernized touches. 
So, here we are, two motivated professionals with one goal: give you our best to keep you “on the read” and provide you with over-the-top comics.
The CheeseMonkey arose from our common will to share and make others profit from our skills and creativity. We want to make a difference and create the next manga generation. Our motto: Let them make “classics”, we draw “captivatings”! 
You will quickly notice our graphical approach is new and medley efficiently dynamism and sensitivity. 
The CheeseMonkey comes up with various themes:
You'll be able to read beautiful stories to your kids and share unforgettable memories with them; travel through the world and catch up with your dreams.
But wait, there's more!
You'll be able to get plenty of action, combat, fight and adrenaline! 
Would you like even more?
You'll also be able to experience delighting romance, feel tenderness and passionate love.
LIBERIA will give you all those exiting sensations and much more !
What we need :
One million dollars, a helicopter and pizzas for everyone. 
But seriously, here are the numbers and milestones:


4 months : it's more or less what we need to produce LIBERIA Volume I (between 150 to 200 pages). Time estimated on the production of a first franga titled “The Martin Stream”(Le Ruisseau Martin). Could we hire just one assistant and we could increase production two times this rate.



20 000€ : This is the basic amount we need to launch the studio. It covers production costs, derivative products, the Franga publication, postal packaging and communication including the website regular update.Plus, it will allow us to create a business able to hire an increasing number of employees, increase productivity and go further in the creative process.


This is a very promising and exciting project we are talking about ! We need your support !

LIBERIA
Bonjour à tous !
Qu'est ce que LIBERIA ??

Une chaleur écrasante, de l'hémoglobine et de la sueur. LIBERIA va vous plonger dans l'univers oppressant du mercenariat ! 
Une équipe endurcie va devoir, pour accomplir sa mission, survivre dans l'univers hostile d'une Afrique noire en plein chaos!
Sous contrat pour une société peu scrupuleuse, le capitaine BLASZCZYK est chargé de secourir un chercheur dans la ville de Monrovia. Son équipe : un ex-orphelin autiste, un free-fighter reconverti, une aristocrate sniper... Mais la mission ne se déroulera pas comme prévue...
Ancrée dans la réalité*, mêlant humour, action et sentiments, LIBERIA s'annonce comme le nouveau genre incontournable du franga.
*(corruption, misère économique, mortalité élevée, etc.)
Qu'est-ce que le CheeseMonkey Studio ?°_°?

Le CheeseMonkey Studio est un studio de production de Franga ! Le Franga est une bande dessinée occidentale basée sur un style graphique de type manga (noir et blanc, cases dynamiques et sens de lecture... de gauche à droite bien sûr!).
Au delà de ces termes techniques, nous sommes deux professionnels dynamiques et motivés qui donnons le meilleur de nous même pour satisfaire vos envies d'intrigues et de passions en tous genres !
Le CheeseMonkey est né d'une volonté commune de partager et de transmettre notre créativité et notre savoir faire. C'est ce qui fait la différence entre un scénario qui sera « classique » et celui qui sera « captivant ». De plus vous remarquerez rapidement que notre style graphique est novateur et associe efficacement dynamisme et émotion. 
Le CheeseMonkey aborde des thèmes variés.
Vous pourrez lire de belles histoires à vos enfants et partager avec eux des instants inoubliables. Vous pourrez également apprécier de magnifiques paysages et retrouver vos rêves d'enfants. 
Mais aussi ! 
Vivre l'ivresse du combat, de l'action, voir l'hémoglobine tâcher vos vêtements et recouvrir les murs !
Egalement !
Vous régaler de romances pulpeuses et enivrantes. Ressentir le souffle chaud d'une sublime créature embraser votre nuque !
LIBERIA vous apportera toutes ces sensations exaltantes et bien plus encore !
De quoi avons-nous besoin ?
Il est osé de faire des prévisions lorsqu'une activité comme la notre démarre. Néanmoins, voici quelques chiffres et dates qui vous permettront d'y voir plus clair :


4 mois : Ceci est la date prévisionnelle de la parution de LIBERIA Tome I (Production d'un tome allant de 150 à 200 pages). Cette estimation est basée sur la production d'un premier Franga (Le Ruisseau Martin). Avec ne serait ce qu'un seul assistant nous pouvons diviser par deux ce délais !



20 000€ : Cette somme représente la mise de base dont nous avons besoin pour lancer l'activité. Elle englobe tout; coûts de production pour les produits dérivés, la parution du Franga, les emballages pour les envois, la communication dont l'entretien du site internet.

<p><strong>The Book</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong>The book will be DIN A4 size (Landscape), Hardcover</p>
<p>32 (or 36?) pages in Black &amp; White + little bit red.</p>
<p>Language : English</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>About me and What I need.</strong></p>
<p>I, the author of this book, am Emiko Takano. I was born in Tokyo, Japan. I graduated from the University of Art in Germany and have worked as a freelance illustrator since then (also in Germany).  </p>
<p>To tell you the reason why I am asking for the support on this website, firstly, I must explain the current state of the art and design profession field here in Germany. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In Germany It is very difficult for a freelance illustrator to obtain a sufficient income to sustain a stable life. </p>
<p>It is particularly difficult for many novice illustrators and designers, who just graduated from art school to get a first job. It is thought that the reason for that is the overly cautious stance of corporate customers, publishers and agents, who buy the illustrations and design.</p>
<p>German publishers and companies, especially the large ones, are overly cautious, in other words very passive, about their businesses. They are reluctant to hire (use) a new illustrator unless they are absolutely convinced that it will be commercially successful.  This makes particularly hard for the novice illustrators to get into the field. Unless the illustrator has won a well-known award when he or she was a student, it takes between 2-3 years before an illustrator can get their first paying job. Many friends from art college have given up along the way and became office workers, retail assistants, housewives, etc. The current state is extremely hard for the young creators to have chance to develop their careers and many of them are forced to take another career path to earn an income to sustain themselves. </p>
<p>Although an illustrator could imagine stories alone, and create graphic novels or picture books, if the creations were a little unique, and not in a main-stream style, they will not be purchased by the publishers, as the German publishers do not do any business unless they are sure it will sell.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As a result, Japanese manga and “weird” american comics (such as Lenore and Emily the strange) took a lot longer to get published in Germany, compared to other european countries - such as France or Italy.</p>
<p>There are some illustrators who start up a small publisher themselves and produce high quality books, but those books would hardly be seen by the general public, and only known among the insiders. </p>
<p>This condition leads to the German illustration industry as a whole to be even more tedious and less interesting. As the publishers and companies only take the “safe bet,” i.e. by hiring only known veteran illustrators, outsourcing them from the other countries, or buying the copyright, Germany is now flooded with the same old illustrations. Even if some interesting ones come up, they often come from abroad. </p>
<p>On the other hand, there are times when new and young illustrators get hired abruptly. Most of the time, however, it is because they can be used “cheaply”. It is not because they wanted to hire the particular illustrator, but rather to take advantage of novice illustrators who have no knowledge of copyrights and average pricing. In these cases, the illustrator is to fully comply with the style that the publisher wants. The quality of the work would often be put aside. And the illustrator would be over-worked on very low wages and treated like a machine. If the illustrator requests better treatment, the response would be that “there are plenty of others”. I also have had a similar experience. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>So those illustrators, who want to try something different, or to stick to their own style, find it extremely hard to develop their careers, even if they are very competent.  I find this current situation surrounding the illustrators in this country to be extremely disappointing and must be changed. </p>
<p>In America, in that respect, that there is a spirit that even if it is a little different, people, not only the publishers and corporations, want to have a try. So this is the reason why I wanted to ask the support on this wonderful website. </p>

About the project
A picture book ""The story of Lilim""
I would like produce a picture storybook, that is not for little kids, but written for teenagers and young adults.
I came up with the concept several years ago and have thought about it for long time. I now feel it is now the right time to realize it.
The pictures are mainly in black and white, and drawn with pens.
Visually, it is in the style of Japanese comics mixed withGerman Expressionism, like Edward Gorey or Tim Burton. The atmosphere can be likened to the world of Edger Allan Poe.
So a little bit gloomy and strange, but also funny and lovely; after my visual Motto ""biting sweet"".
The Theme of the story is maternal love and change of the character's heart.

 
The Story
This is the story of a little girl called “Lilim”.
Lilim is not a human being, she lives in a different world to the one we live in. 
Her father works relentlessly each day, as a collector of the human souls, and she (almost) always accompanies her father when he comes to this world to do his job, as she has already lost her mother.
 
One day, when she was accompanying the father as usual, but this time they get separated.
A strange girl from another world, landed in London at the end of the 19th century. Humans get horrified by her appearance and try to attack her.
A lady comes to her rescue,  when she looked her up, her face looked very similar to the portrait of her mother, which hangs at her home...

 
 
 
The Book
The book will be DIN A4 size (Landscape), Hardcover
32 (or 36?) pages in Black & White + little bit red.

<p>The website is currently in an open beta test and available for anyone to try out.  To use the inventory system, you'll just need to sign up for a free account.  You can visit the site at <a href=""http://www.mastrova.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.Mastrova.com</a>.  Also, <a href=""http://www.mastrova.com/community/threads/whats-working-whats-not-and-whats-coming-in-the-future.7/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here is a forum post</a> about what's working and what's not. </p>
<p>Our current focus is on sports trading cards and comic books.  At present our database has over 1.7 million baseball cards and we’re in the process of finalizing the initial data for over 2.5 million football, hockey and basketball cards.  We are also hard at work on building up our comics database, which now stands at 25,000 issues.  We’re adding thousands of issues weekly and should have this fleshed out to over 500,000 issues by the time the price guide portion of the site launches.  Once we have this information up to date, we’ll be adding other sports such as boxing, tennis, soccer, golf, wresting, etc. as well as non-sports and entertainment cards.</p>

<div class=""template asset""> </div>
<p>Many of our features will also be offered completely free!  This includes our ""Vault"" inventory system which is currently up and running for sports cards and available for testing.  You can create your own inventory folders and then add items that you own, items that are on your want list, or items that you have available for trade or sale.  We are currently working on the code to make this active for comic books as well.  Our checklists and search engine will also be available without any fees whatsoever.  </p>

<p> </p>
<p>The price guide portion of the site will be subscription fee based feature.  While we would love the make this free as well, unfortunately we need to pay for the cost of running the site and will need to hire additional employees as the site grows.  There is a ton of work involved with the validation of the data we grab and syncing it with our database.  With all the features we want to add and the amount of data we want to track, it just isn't feasible to offer this for free.  Having said that, we think the pricing levels we have come up with are very fair, flexible and affordable.  </p>

<p>So what are we going to use the funding for?  The main project we have at Mastrova right now, is getting the <a href=""http://www.mastrova.com/comic_sample.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">price guide</a> up and running.  Our main source of pricing is going to be finalized sales from eBay of graded cards and comics.  Basically for us to display the finalized sale prices from eBay, we need to pay them to license the data.  We would also like to use a portion of the money to hire another employee to help with the data entry and validation, it’s quite a bit of work and we can use the help!  Another portion of the money would go to buying a couple software tools that we think will really improve our site and make it stand out, while greatly enhancing the experience for our customers.</p>
<p>Once we get the price guide and data established, we have many more ideas and plans in the works.  We'll be adding more inventory features in the coming months, as well as special checklisting features tailored to collectors of individual players, sets and comic titles.  We hope to have a full featured marketplace and trading system by the end of 2013 that will allow our customers to create virtual store fronts or run auction style sales.  We will also continually be updating our databases with new releases, adding images, and adding as much info as possible.</p>
<p>Thanks for checking us out and we hope you enjoy our site and are as excited about it as we are!</p></div>","Mastrova.com is a new website aimed at being the best collectibles resources available.  We want to provide detailed information for every comic book and trading card that exists, as well as up to date pricing using data from actual completed sales (sample pricing page).  Not only that, but we also want to build a great community for collectors to come and share their knowledge and experiences, keep a detailed inventory of their collectibles and also show them off!  The reward tiers we're offering are a substantial discount from what our normal subscription prices will be (non-backer pricing is listed in each tier), so be sure to take advantage of the special pricing!

Our current focus is on sports trading cards and comic books.  At present our database has over 1.7 million baseball cards and we’re in the process of finalizing the initial data for over 2.5 million football, hockey and basketball cards.  We are also hard at work on building up our comics database, which now stands at 25,000 issues.  We’re adding thousands of issues weekly and should have this fleshed out to over 500,000 issues by the time the price guide portion of the site launches.  Once we have this information up to date, we’ll be adding other sports such as boxing, tennis, soccer, golf, wresting, etc. as well as non-sports and entertainment cards.
 

Search results page
 
Many of our features will also be offered completely free!  This includes our ""Vault"" inventory system which is currently up and running for sports cards and available for testing.  You can create your own inventory folders and then add items that you own, items that are on your want list, or items that you have available for trade or sale.  We are currently working on the code to make this active for comic books as well.  Our checklists and search engine will also be available without any fees whatsoever.  

Vault inventory system
 
The price guide portion of the site will be subscription fee based feature.  While we would love the make this free as well, unfortunately we need to pay for the cost of running the site and will need to hire additional employees as the site grows.  There is a ton of work involved with the validation of the data we grab and syncing it with our database.  With all the features we want to add and the amount of data we want to track, it just isn't feasible to offer this for free.  Having said that, we think the pricing levels we have come up with are very fair, flexible and affordable.  
 


Sample pricing page

 
So what are we going to use the funding for?  The main project we have at Mastrova right now, is getting the price guide up and running.  Our main source of pricing is going to be finalized sales from eBay of graded cards and comics.  Basically for us to display the finalized sale prices from eBay, we need to pay them to license the data.  We would also like to use a portion of the money to hire another employee to help with the data entry and validation, it’s quite a bit of work and we can use the help!  Another portion of the money would go to buying a couple software tools that we think will really improve our site and make it stand out, while greatly enhancing the experience for our customers.
Once we get the price guide and data established, we have many more ideas and plans in the works.  We'll be adding more inventory features in the coming months, as well as special checklisting features tailored to collectors of individual players, sets and comic titles.  We hope to have a full featured marketplace and trading system by the end of 2013 that will allow our customers to create virtual store fronts or run auction style sales.  We will also continually be updating our databases with new releases, adding images, and adding as much info as possible.
Thanks for checking us out and we hope you enjoy our site and are as excited about it as we are!",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><img alt=""What is War Dance Comics?"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.wardancecomics.com/art/IndieGoGo/wiwdc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p>War Dance Comics will be a small press, creator owned comic book publishing company, with a desire to offer a constructive, effective environment for up and coming comic book creators to share their stories to the world. We want to provide creative teams a place that they can turn to who understands what it can be to be a comic book creator and have a day job. For many creators, this is a hurdle that isn't easily leapt, and can be a rapid deterant from working in the industry. </p>
<p>War Dance's debut comic will be Sancte, a tale by War Dance founders Aaron Pierce and Kitty Patterson. It will follow the story of Frank Rames, a man who's lost his past, and can't see his future. He finds himself dragged into a world of super natural occurance, and in the middle of a war between angels and demons. </p>
<p>Our goal for this campaign is to raise the funds necessary to publish our comic, and establish our presence at cons to start gathering more creaters into our fold. With this, we should be able to get our publishing company on the ground and start moving toward bigger and better goals in the future for all comics coming together under the Wardance label. </p>

<h3><img alt=""What we need and What you get"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.wardancecomics.com/art/IndieGoGo/wwnwyg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p>War Dance comics needs to get a few things handled in order to get ourselves in the active market:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sancte #1 Published - A comic book publisher isn't much without a comic to boast. We'll be working with top quality printers to get our debut comic published at an economical price for the best quality we can find. </li>
<li>Convention Display - We want to present ourselves as a professional company, not some fly by night operation. As such, our presentation at cons is essential to our success. We need signage and display racks etc, as well as table covers and other con essentials so we can put our best foot forward. </li>
<li>Convention Fees - We have very little money to foot our own project, so if we want to get out there, we need your help! Your contributions would go toward purchasing a table at one or two conventions so that we can represent what we're selling. Tables at these events are no cheap ordeal!</li>
<li>Operational Expenses - Office supplies, domain name registrations, incorporation expenses, etc. We are running a business and as we do so, the money will also be used to help run it.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we do not raise our total goal, we'll begin prioritizing our funds. Any money beyond our target goal would go toward more con appearances, and publishing more books, either our own or fellow creators if we get other projects quickly enough. Either way, it will all be put toward the development and growth of our company.</p>
<p>As a way of saying thank you, we'll be giving you all something, be it praise on our website and in our books, issues of Sancte, prints, or original art. You'll also have the knowledge that you helped launch a publishing company that is by the creators, for the creators, to help our community grow!</p>

<p>Kitty is a writer, I am an artist. We've both been struggling to get our messages out to the world for years now. We've finally come together as a creative team on Sancte, and we're having a blast putting it all together and making something cohesive out of it. With War Dance we want to help other creators in similar situations get past the hump of ""How do I get this out there?"" and ""How do I get this done"" by providing our own on the job experieince and management for them. We want to be the publisher that will accept their schedules and understand when they can't quite make it due to the day job or personal issues arising.</p>
<p>We are the publisher for the indie, the small-press, the young guns. The ones who desperately need a door into the industry but don't have it just yet. We're not trying to compete with Marvel or DC, we're trying to tell our stories and help our fellow creators tell their's. By funding our project, you're helping dreams come true, and drive and ambition pay off. You're opening the market to a whole knew generation of storytellers and visionaries, and helping us expand our forrays into the realm of art.</p>

<p>In the early seventies, the second one was a kid from Kenya, Sanogo. He was fast! Oh man, he was fast! His legs were like the paws of a cheetah, reaching 60 miles per hour! His tribe adored him like a God. One day he disappeared too. The tribe since then has a song that describes the “hand of Pasusu” coming to kidnap Sanogo and bringing disgrace on the village.</p>

After an epic battle with Astaroth's minions
 



Welcome to...                                                                            


the amazing world of 



Your contribution will help us acheieve our goal of printing a comic book consisting of 20 full colored pages in A4 format!


  


Devil 's legacy is an animated adventure, which speaks of the eternal conflict between good and evil inside us and how a person can always change in life when he has to defend the values in which he believes and fight for the loved ones.
it's like Berserk will meet Ghost In The Shell under the direction of Go Nagai, with a dip in Death Note, a story worthy of the Dante's Divine Comedy, spectacular animations of Akira and the power of the super robot's coming from the 80', all mixed up and shaked with Devilman.





Vincent and the mythological Fenrir


This is a deep story, which takes place through a thousand years of history till our presents days. An incredible cast, more than 100 characters perfectly described one by one, a universe created entirely for this television series, 2000 pages of script are waiting for bring you in this amazing world.






The Renegade roams the wastelands of purgatory ...






The chronology of the tale on which is based the whole project embraces almost a millennium, starting from 1123 A.D. till nowadays.
It develops in parallel in two different dimensions, Earth and Purgatory. As for the “butterfly effect”, what happens in one world can, in our case too, affect events in the other.And that is the theory and the philosophy underneath. 
The tale is based on three main characters: Vincent McKane, Sir William McKane and Astaroth the demon. 




Vincent Mc Kane




Sir William Mc Kane




The Evil Astaroth



 That makes it a choral play in which the fatal flow of these three heroes creates a thread that will include the destiny of many others complex characters, any one with his - or her - heritage of life and death experiences.




Everything begins when, in 1123 A.D., Sir William McKane, a Scottish Templar knight, and his heroic crew fought against a bunch of witches trying to summon the most evil and powerful demon from the other side of the “mirror”: Astaroth.
The lord of evil forces is about to reach our world when William, showing great courage, sacrifices his mortal life in order to prevent this disaster. He jumps against Astaroth and they both fall into a dimensional hole. They end up in an other dimension, unknown to both of them; a world that is in between Earth, land of the livings, and Hell.








Sir William rises back to life in the afterworld as a bodied soul and his fight against Astaroth has just begun and Purgatory becomes the battleground. During the fight William breaks one of Astaroth’s horns and manage to escape with the splinter.




Astaroth with his powers could eventually leave that crappy place, but he cannot, as he is “incomplete” missing a part of his horn. So the prince of darkness is stuck there! Both for rage and to prevent Sir William to leave Purgatory – eventually by being “elected” for Heaven – Astaroth summons his four generals from Hell.
The cruel Aamon, the smart Malphas, the crazy Pruslas and the faithful Barbatos the clairvoyant gather around their leader and together they cast a spell that produces the most horrifying of the earthquakes. It's a catastrophe; any type of natural disaster shakes Purgatory, the gates to Heaven and Hell collapse and nothing lasts of them but relics…




The Evil Army!



 What happens now is that people in the world of the living they keep dying and their souls keep ending up in Purgatory. But there are no exits anymore now that the gates have collapsed! So it happens that the population of souls waiting to be judged rises day after day, for the eternal cycle of the Universal Judgment being interrupted.
Wherever people gather they tend to create society. So it happens in Purgatory where a new syncretism creates a world where past and future links together, mixing cultures, technologies and human kinds; it is an amazing melting pot, a human miracle, under the oppression of a tyrant called Astaroth.
He imposes his power spreading terror all around the five continents with his army of demons. He wants to find Sir William and get back the splinter of his horn. In the meantime Sir William got organized. After having realized all that happened to him, he started to wander across the unknown land. Along his journey he has met many people that have decided to join him in his will to fight against that monster and try to put the Universe back to balance.



So, the “Resistance” was born. With Sir William McKane now ride Sir Ryan, Shizuko the Japanese warrior, the young Eric and other soldiers of any origin. Along the centuries this war goes on. The Resistance has established five bases, one in each continent. They have built castles and fortresses to protect the five entrances to Purgatory, and that for one reason. They know that one day Astaroth will try again to get into our dimension to rule over the living.





The Heroes of the story!



They also know that to do that he needs a new body, a special body, composed by the pieces of five different special kids, the Star Children. One day those kids will maybe get into Purgatory and when they will, it will be through one of the five passages. The Resistance must be ready to save them before Astaroth finds them.






The 5 star children



The struggle between the two sides goes on for almost nine centuries until in XX century something changes in Astaroth’ strategy. The Astral alignments are favorable, so Barbatos has forwarded. The time to rule the Universe has come. Malphas is the only demon that can step in the world of the leavings as a sort of ambassador of evil.
As a spirit he wanders on Earth and he finally finds what he was looking for. He gets in touch with a powerful lodge, the Lodge of Illuminati, introducing himself as a hermit magician. He provides them a Grimorium, a spell book, and lure them with the promise of great power. They just have to follow his indications and help him to find five particular kids and send them into another dimension.



Along the years of the XX centuries four of these kids have been found. One is a German kid, Mark Weigart, whose peculiarity was to be the best violin player ever, his fingers so sensitive that the sound coming from his violin was considered the most incredible sound of the century; then WWII arrived and during that terrible time, one mysterious day, Mark disappeared.
In the early seventies, the second one was a kid from Kenya, Sanogo. He was fast! Oh man, he was fast! His legs were like the paws of a cheetah, reaching 60 miles per hour! His tribe adored him like a God. One day he disappeared too. The tribe since then has a song that describes the “hand of Pasusu” coming to kidnap Sanogo and bringing disgrace on the village.
In the eighties two twins, Jesse and Megan, a couple of geniuses with ESP powers had the same destiny in the Canadian prairies.
The Last Child







Vincent and Aura



In this amazing series he will be placed in front of his incredible destiny and he will accept unknown challenges and a foggy future and so he will end up in the same place where the other Star Children have been taken: Purgatory. Vincent will join Sir William and the other fellows of the Resistance and, along with you, he will play a key role in the development of the future of the Universe.
Along his journey many other characters will join him. The relationships among them won't always be fine… His courage, morality, sense of honor and justice will be challenged and tested.
Until he will finally decide weather to be the savior of the Universe or the force that could destroy it forever… 




Vincent can't always control his darkside...

<h3>Dave Sim and Aardvark-Vanaheim have partnered with The Waverly Press to present Sim’s new modified version of this classic tale published nearly three decades ago, expanded with rarities from this comics milestone!</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1605299147/kvxs3an5ncoryqit3yvf.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>1992: After departing his enormously successful record-breaking run on SPIDER-MAN for Marvel Comics, Todd McFarlane launched his creation SPAWN which has since earned its place as the most successful independent comic-book of all time. Shortly after the initial launch, McFarlane invited 4 of the most respected writers in comics—Alan Moore, Neil Gaiman, Frank Miller, and Dave Sim—to collaborate with him on a string of single issues. At the time, Dave Sim was riding his own wave of success and popularity with his groundbreaking, award-winning series CEREBUS. Sim accepted McFarlane’s offer (as did Moore, Gaiman and Miller) and the two of them embarked on their collaboration which appeared in issue No.10 of SPAWN in 1993. McFarlane illustrated Sim’s story, bringing their popular characters together in a tale about Creator’s Rights called ""Crossing Over."" The issue made such an impact that their collaboration went on to win the 1993 WIZARD WORLD AWARD for “Best Single Story” and remains one of the most memorable collaborations in the history of comics.</p>
<p>2020: Dave Sim and Aardvark-Vanaheim have partnered with The Waverly Press to present Sim’s new modified version of this classic tale published nearly three decades ago, expanded with new content and rarities from this comics milestone. It’s still as fresh and relevant today as when it first appeared. While the original edition of SPAWN No. 10 was published in full color, this special edition - at Dave Sim’s insistence - presents the story in black and white. In the original edition, McFarlane drew what Dave Sim has called “the definitive Cerebus” (“...more people saw Todd’s Cerebus that one month than had seen my Cerebus in the decade prior to SPAWN No. 10”). Working gingerly and painstakingly around his career-ending (2015) wrist ailment, Sim fulfilled what he calls a “last ambition” to render the Kitchener Sequence as he originally pictured it, and to produce three new covers. He also redrew the Cerebus figures throughout the issue. McFarlane’s loose, detailed, energetic art alongside Sim’s cartoon realism brush and line work highlights the power of each artist in the pages of this new edition of SPAWN No. 10!</p>

<p>My name is James Mascia, I am an English teacher at a high school in Maryland who is passionate about writing novels and comics for children and teens. I like coming up with new ways to interest young people in reading.</p>
<p>I am working on a project called ""The Poe Murders"" which is a graphic retelling of many of Edgar Allan Poe's mystery and horror stories meshed into a single tale. The stories included in this graphic-novel are: <em>The Cask of Amontillado, The Tell-Tale Heart, The Masque of the Red Death, The Purloined Letter, The Fall of the House of Usher, The Raven</em>, as well as others.</p>
<p>The graphic-novel will be told in the style of a mystery, in which the characters are searching for the mysterious source causing rational men and women to commit these horrific murders.</p>
<p>It is my hope that by creating this, it will interest young people in some of Poe's tales.</p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p><strong><br/></strong>By funding this project, you will be helping in the creation and production of ""The Poe Murders."" It will be used to pay the artists for their work on the pages as well as the printing and distribution of the books themselves.</p>
<p>For helping to fund the project, you will recieve:</p>
<p><strong>For a contribution of $2</strong></p>
<ul>

<div>

Whatever funds we receive for the comic will be used toward paying the artists and creating a great graphic-novel that anyone would be excited to read. Even if we do not make our goal, this is where the funds will be going.

The Impact
Each and every contribution will make a huge difference in getting this graphic-novel produced.
My YA series, High School Heroes has been greatly reviewed and has sold very well. The webcomic of the same series won WeVolt's Lord of the Rumble competition and has also received many great reviews.
This graphic-novel will get just as much inticate attention as my other projects to make it the best it can possible be, but that can only be done with funding.


Other Ways You Can Help

<p><strong><span>Why You Need Mark Rudolph's Closing Doors:</span></strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong><a href=""http://cvcomics.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mark Rudolph’s</a></strong> Closing Doors is the story of struggling record store owner Elvin Cherry who is torn between the necessities of living in a stark urban landscape where mom and pop stores are quickly becoming a thing of the past and his love of the store that is not only his life’s work but also the hub of a small eccentric community.</p>
<p>Our communities have changed so much in the 21<sup>st</sup>century that many people no longer remember the thrill of digging through dusty crates and high-piled boxes for hidden gold.  We rely more on yelp reviews for guidance than a learned shop owner behind a counter and showcase shop for the best deals instead of indulging in the age old tradition of haggling.    Closing Doors is a love story for everyone who laments the loss of the record store down the block that started your obsession with Stax Records, the newsstand stand on the corner that sold you your first copy of Punk Magazine or local comic shop that showed you that there was more to there was more to funny books than DC vs. Marvel.  </p>

<p><strong>ABOUT MARK RUDOLPH</strong></p>
<p>Mark Rudolph is a Detroit cartoonist who works within the framework of heavy metal and caricature. Bringing a sense of humor to a genre of music widely known for it's seriousness, his work combines elements of 60s comics, album cover paintings and political cartoon to magazines, album covers and comics. Drawing from the rich history of comics illustration, his work shrugs off the stereotypical stylings of heavy metal imagery and focuses on the musicians themselves rather than fantasy or gore aesthetics associated with the genre. The grotesqueness is conveyed in the exaggerated human form rather than subject matter of the lyrics and album covers.</p>
<p>Growing up in the 80s, he learned the analog forbearers of digital coloring, art reproduction and printing, which has influenced his digital work to still possess imperfections and the look as if a hand has touched the art. Nearly all of his illustration process is still analog. Ink on paper with minimal digital postproduction. Having a tactile finished piece that relies only on a few simple tools rather than a computer, electricity and software is deeply satisfying in its simplicity for him. Simplicity is what Rudolph is striving toward. </p>
<p>He's been working in the extreme music underground since the early 90s where he published fanzines, created album covers and co-hosted a podcast about heavy metal.  Combining his love of music and art, Rudolph has recently published <em>Satan is Alive: A tribute to Mercyful Fate</em> which includes prose, comics and illustration by a group of renowned artists and cartoonists. He is currently working on the graphic novel <em>I, Barbarian</em>, the <em>Henry and Glenn Forever and Ever </em>comic series and monthly illustrations for <em>Decibel</em> and <em>Metal hammer </em>magazine. </p>

<h3><strong>Update 1:</strong></h3>
<div class=""activity-content"">
<p>Hey gang! Thank you so much for you support, it really has been overwhelming and humbling to me, and I can’t thank you all enough. What started off as a small fundraiser to get a few books printed has definitely turned into a full-on preorder, and I can’t wait to see my comics in print and get them out to everyone! I’m so excited, just thank you all so so much!</p>
<p>I also want to add that after a lot of thought and consideration, I’ve decided to add in my Memory Lane strips to conclude the series of comics in the book. Those strips highlight a huge part of my life, and I really feel that they are an incredibly important part of my comic as a whole. Not to mention that a big reason I wanted to make those strips was to reach out to people who have gone through something similar, and to let them know they are not alone. It is my hope that by including them in the book that they will reach even more people.</p>
<p>We’re a bit past the halfway point for this fundraiser (21 days left as of this writing), and I sincerely appreciate and thank every one of you for making this possible. &lt;3</p>

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>Hey Guys! My name is Christopher Williams, author of a journal comic of the same name called Christopher! I'm 30 years old, and I've been drawing for as long as I can remember, and have had a love of comics for who knows how long. </p>
<p>My journal comic is about my everyday life, and also about how my wife I handle being a new parents to a toddler (!!). When I started this comic, it was originally made just to announce to our friends and family that my wife and I had gotten pregnant. But I had always wanted to DO a journal comic, so I figured it would also be a good way to keep track of the pregnancy as we went along. Soon afterward I became addicted to making comics, and decided that I would make this comic as long as I possibly can, especially to catalog my son's growth.</p>
<p>Since starting my comic, it has also become a sort of therapy to me. Some of the times that I am at my happiest are when I finish a comic, and know that people are reading it. I've also used it to work out personal issues and stress, and surprisingly to me, it's worked rather well! My comic has essentially become my life on display for everyone to read.</p>

I've also used it to work out personal issues and stress, and surprisingly to me, it's worked rather well! My comic has essentially become my life on display for everyone to read.

It is inspired by a Japanese story telling device by which personal characteristics are present in the fictional world as a sort of super power or pseudo-science.

If we are able to meet our goal and ultimately release Ahura online for reading with (at least) weekly updates, then it will be available online for your viewing anytime. Plus, we will hopefully create a store for the site using Society6, and other sources, where you will be able to buy merchandise based on the story world. In addition to merchandise that will be available for purchase, we hope to include backer rewards.

<p>(Map of North America as per the time period of Ahura)</p>
<p>The world of Ahura is a near-distant future where magic and science are used synonymously, and the United States of America has long since been broken into several independent countries with their own respective shadows of American culture. (Example: Amerigo, a rather peaceful land which is more or less America as it is today. Montania, a dystopian federation that embodies all the evil that American politics stands to succumb to.)</p>
<p>The artistic style of the tale is heavily inspired by Japanese anime/manga, and the story's imagery borrows from a number of various religions and folklore including Japanese, Mayan, Australian Aborigines, North American Tribal Culture, and much more. I am currently overseeing the illustrations personally, but as the project grows, I hope to include illustrations from a separate artist.</p>
<p>We also hope to eventually incorporate audio book style readings into the chapter pages, but the first priority will be getting the serial itself produced.</p>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>As stated before, our finances are somewhat limited. So with our day jobs, this makes finding time to work on illustrations difficult. Our original intention was to release Ahura (First book title: Alali) as a physical book via a publishing agent. However, due to the highly detailed nature of our illustrations and hectic work schedules, the images were being produced slower than we had hoped. Thus, we decided to skip to our Plan B: The Web Serial. Once the site is up, readers will be able to read the finished chapters while we work on the next set, but we need money to make it happen. The bare necessities are the website and the copyright, but we need the extra to make sure we have something extra to give back to the readers and supporters. Then there is also the matter of our equipment. One of the computers we use is a Dell Inspiron that was purchased as a floor model close over three years ago. Just recently it came close to suffering a memory failure preventing me from working on the site and its assets. If we are able to meet our goal, we will be able to purchase updated equipment to ensure that we are delivering the best quality product we can, and all funds left over will go towards progressing the project in other ways such as merchandise, translation, extended hosting, etc.</p>

<h3>Donation Perks</h3>
<div>With us being a rather small operation, and sorting out the funding of the project itself, deciding upon perks has been difficult, BUT below are some descriptions of cool items you can get if you donate to Ahura.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Chosen Value Below $30- While certain donation packages will yield gift rewards, you do not have to donate that much. I intend to post a list of all backers in the ""thanks"" page when it is complete.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>$30- The demon masks will be made out of cotton so that they are breathable. The masks will ideally be one-size-fits-all, but this may be subject to change.<br/>

If we are able to meet our goal, we will be able to purchase updated equipment to ensure that we are delivering the best quality product we can, and all funds left over will go towards progressing the project in other ways such as merchandise, translation, extended hosting, etc.

Donation Perks
With us being a rather small operation, and sorting out the funding of the project itself, deciding upon perks has been difficult, BUT below are some descriptions of cool items you can get if you donate to Ahura.

Chosen Value Below $30- While certain donation packages will yield gift rewards, you do not have to donate that much. I intend to post a list of all backers in the ""thanks"" page when it is complete.

$30- The demon masks will be made out of cotton so that they are breathable. The masks will ideally be one-size-fits-all, but this may be subject to change.

$50-
The Regulatory Order perk gets you a Montanian propaganda poster. The image below is a rough draft of the final product. Your copy will be cleaned up and with some added deatails. It will be 24x18 inches in size.

$150-
The seal of the demon is an approximately 8-inch wide plate of clay symbolic of the seal of the Demon that abducts Alali. On the back of the crest is a message, but will yours depict the message of Mitsuuchi, or something unique to your copy? (MYSTERY) It will hopefully be glazed and pigmented to have an ethereal purple tint. You can see the seal again in the picture above of Teril with her father.
