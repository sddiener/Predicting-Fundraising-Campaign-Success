<p>The numbers are appalling. Just here in the US, we generate 250 Million tons of garbage each year or about 5 lb person per day – Yikes! About 6 months ago we came across these beautiful sets of plates, bowls, trays and spoons that are 100% biodegradable and compostable, and have only one single ingredient --- a leaf.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>And the idea was born. We have been using them in our personal lives and believe they are a welcome option for everyone when you have a party or a get-together and would prefer using single-use dinnerware.</p>
<p><strong>The facts</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Most of the waste we generate finds its way to landfill or worse still, the oceans.</li>
<li>Over 60 percent of what we put in our landfills is organic waste, such as food scraps. </li>
<li>Decomposing landfills release large amounts of greenhouse gases including methane.</li>
<li>Aerobic decomposition from composting produces almost no greenhouse gases.</li>
<li>Compost improves soil, adds important nutrients for plants, and reduces the need for expensive commercial fertilizers.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Our solution</strong></p>
<p>4eSync products are completely natural and made from the leaves of the arecanut tree. The arecanut leaves completely decompose within a period of 50-60 days. There are no colors or any external additives added to make these products giving them a natural look and feel. Water and heat are the only two components used in the production process.</p>
<p>They are microwave safe! You can use these products to heat food in the microwave or store food in the refrigerator. The leaves are washed with fresh water during the production process. They are also heated to temperatures above 90-degree centigrade which ensure that they are completely germ-free.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The dimensional stability of the product is amazing. It is as light as other disposable plates, such as styrofoam, and nearly as sturdy as melamine or glass. The extra edges of the products make it very comfortable for holding. These qualities make it ideal for a buffet or sit down dining.</p>
<p>Though the material is light, it is 2-3 mm thick which enables it to hold liquids very easily. It can hold liquid items for several hours without affecting its shape. Thus it works for serving soups and foods with sauces which would make other single-use plates soggy. 4eSync leaf plates have all the qualities of a regular plate, but the benefit of being disposable, compostable and biodegradable.</p>
<p>Thanks to progressive communities around the country, composting activities are catching on. Over 198 communities across various states such as CA, WA, OR, CT, IL, MA, KY, and Maryland have adopted food waste and compost collection programs. In SF over 80% of the waste is either recycled or marked for compost.</p>
<p>We provide a viable compostable and biodegradable option for single use dinnerware.</p>
<p><strong>***NO TREES ARE CUT DOWN OR HARMED DURING THE PRODUCTION OF OUR PRODUCTS***</strong></p>
<p>Our products are made from the fallen leaves of arecanut (betel nut) plants.</p>
<p>These products made out of arecanut leaves have better dimensional stability besides being hygienic and are biodegradable. The leaves are collected from arecanut plantations, brought to manufacturing units, cleaned and processed to make high-quality products. No chemical is used in the production process - just the leaf, water &amp; heat.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>With over 40 years of combined experience in product management, across various industries, we are equipped with the knowledge to ensure a steady supply and react quickly to increase in demand.</p>

<p><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></p>
<p>As with any production, the primary challenge here is the possibility of delays. Since the products are made in India there is the additional challenge of accounting for the delivery time</p>
<p>However, since we anticipate these products to be in high demand, we will be planning for some safety inventory as well as tight coordination with our partners. We plan on having multiple purchase orders open with scheduled delivery times. We also anticipate carrying about one month of inventory at the minimum. With these checks and balance in place, we seek to ameliorate the risk.</p>

Most of the waste we generate finds its way to landfill or worse still, the oceans.
Over 60 percent of what we put in our landfills is organic waste, such as food scraps. 
Decomposing landfills release large amounts of greenhouse gases including methane.

<h3>What's it all about? </h3>
<p>I'm Jason, an eco-conscious entrepreneurs concerned with a couple of things: Making great beer, and helping to save the planet, starting with our little friends the bees. We're crowdfunding so we can hit the ground running. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552673217/jqtuf1swwomgbzwn28nh.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We are a super eco-friendly beer company looking to launch our first product called The Pollinator. A 5% highly sessionable pilsner lager brewed in Essex, UK. It has a complex and balanced bitter finish and a crisp clean taste. It's vegan and our whole ethos is around sustainability and providing pragmatic solutions with our business, starting with our wildflower packaging. Our wildflower coasters literally grow a habitat for bees, butterflies and other insects, and each time you plant them you can get money off your next order with us (more on that later). Our aim is to grow 1 million square meters of wildflower space to help save our bees and have a real impact on these eco-systems. 97% of all wildflower habitats have disappeared since WW2 and we want to directly change that. </p>
<p>We are crowdfunding to get our project off the grand and gauge consumer interest. Think of us like fair trade coffee, sure you can drink someone else's beer, but what are they doing for the planet? We'd love you to be a part of our journey to make a positive change. </p>

</div><div>
<h3>Our perks </h3>
<p>We are pre-ordering our first full scale batch of beer. We are asking for £50,000 so we can start out business, the minimum we need to produce the contracted brew itself is much lower but obviously we would like to raise this amount or far more in order to fulfil our commitments. We give 10% of our profits to bee saving charities and to have a wider impact on our causes we'd obviously like to produce lots of beer! </p>
<p>The perks are literally vouchers to pre-order our beer, there's no prototyping or fear of you not being able to get this beer for your money, and range from £5 - £100 so anyone can try our beer and see our packaging concept for themselves. </p>
<p>If the whole goal is not reached we can supply our backers with beer no problem, but we'd obviously like to spread our message far and wide, which is why we picked indiegogo and the crowdfunding route. </p>
</div><div>
<p>By backing our campaign you are advocating for these causes and supporting a small business truly trying to change how they operate from the very beginning. We want to build a business on the basis of our ethics. For instance there are several mainstream beer brands that are vegan, but they don't promote. We want to promote these things and they are at the heart of everything we do. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>In terms of challenges for our crowdfund, we don't really have any, we would just like you to be a part of our journey and be our first customers. We have grand ambitions and would like to affect our charitable and environmental concerns by expanding more rapidly than traditional craft beer entities. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Ryan, co-owner of Juice for Joy Oklahoma City and I am seeking to raise funds to help get us kickstarted after COVID-19 setbacks! For now, it is just myself and the owner of the company, my best friend, Benoris. We are an Oklahoma City based, raw, cold-pressed juice company! Since 2018, Benoris has been deeply inspired by juicing and knew when he first started that he would find a way to build his own company. He's been motivated since then to figure out how to make his dreams come true. In March 2020, we were on the brink of beginning the journey together - only to have our course change due to COVID-19. Now we're back and more motivated to prosper than EVER!</p>
<p><strong>More About The Owners:</strong></p>
<p>Oklahoma City born and raised - our lives lead us to a passion for cold-pressed juice and healthy living! Since a young age we've both had a strong desire to help others - from our families to people of all walks of life. Ryan has an extensive background in Customer Service and has a Holistic Health Certification. Ben has a background in Horticulture and is almost done with his Associates in Biology! They both met in early 2019 and with their passion for healthy living, this dream started to become a reality!</p>
<p><strong>What We Need and What You Get:</strong></p>
<p>We are seeking $8,000 for several things we will need to officially open our business.</p>
<p>In March 2020, we were on the brink of beginning, only to have the United States declare a state of emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic. All of our efforts were halted. Since then, things have been difficult at times but we haven't taken our thinking caps off! We have a couple of pending partnerships with successful businesses in the Oklahoma City area. This money will go towards a couple things, including: a commercial fridge, part of our first month's rent, product labelling, equipment, manufacturers licensing.</p>
<p>For providing us with this help, we're offering two gifts, including:</p>
<p>- a Juice for Joy logo sticker </p>
<p>- if you are local, a Juice ""Sample Pack"", consisting of our four signature juices in 8 ounce bottles! </p>
<p>*PLEASE REACH OUT IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN BEING A PRIVATE INVESTOR! </p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>What This Means To Us</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This company means the world to us. We each began our own health journey several years before we met and we can each say that these experiences have changed our lives in an unimaginable way! Cold-pressed juice was the CORNERSTONE of the vibrancy we now feel and we want nothing more than to share this joy with the WORLD, hence the name, ""Juice for Joy"". Long term we wish to have our juice distributed in stores and restaurants all over Oklahoma. ""Health and Wellness"" is something that many Oklahomans (including ourselves) weren't all too keen on and the community is growing day by day. As well as the vegan community in the Oklahoma City metro area!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have done everything we possibly can to get ourselves set up for success. We have talked with our health department multiple times and with the items we are seeking funding for, we truly can't see much of ANYTHING else stopping our momentum! The biggest challenge for us has been financial - due to us both being laid off from our day jobs due to COVID-19 earlier this year. </p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The Goal of this Campaign</strong></h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The reason for this campaign is to raise the funds we need to take MannaBrew to the United States and make this a global project by scaling the awareness, demand, and production of MannaBrew. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We want to scale up hard and fast, in order to broaden the reach of the positive impact MannaBrew has in its various stages to as many people as possible. This includes creating jobs, having a positive impact on the environment, and helping more people make healthy choices. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">In the end, it is not about how many units have been sold, but how many lives have been changed for the better - that's why we are here. </p>

<h2><strong>MannaBrew: The mesquite superfood coffee that's changing the lives of everyone involved. </strong></h2>
<p>We're not another coffee brand trying to convince you that our coffee is the best, because this is <b>NOT coffee in the traditional sense</b>.</p>
<p>MannaBrew is, in fact, made from a superfood known as Mesquite, roasted in almost the same way as coffee. </p>
<p>So you still get to enjoy a cup of rich, smooth, delicious dark liquid - but it is unlike anything that you have ever tasted before.</p>
<p><strong>To summarise... </strong>It looks like coffee, can be brewed by the same methods as coffee, enjoyed the same way coffee would be, but it is a superfood and tastes super good!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>""As an avid coffee addict -this is possibly one of the most palatable beverages."" - Joy</i><br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>What exactly is ""mesquite""? </strong></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://mannabrew.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MannaBrew-Gif-Story.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Quite simply, mesquite is a type of thorn tree. It bears its ""fruit"" in the shape of a long, pod-shaped legume. These legumes are what we use to craft the delicious beverage called MannaBrew. <strong>BUT </strong>the Mesquite tree is an invasive species in South Africa and is using up precious resources on our farmlands!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The story of MannaBrew </strong></h3>
<p>We like to break the story behind Mannabrew into four parts, and it goes a little something like this...</p>
<p><strong>1. Harvesting: <i>Wild Harvested</i></strong></p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://mannabrew.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MannaBrew-Gif-Harvest.gif"" src=""""/>
</div><p>The Mesquite tree is one of the hardiest trees on earth. Its roots can grow up to 50 meters, seeking precious water in desert areas.</p><p>As an invasive species in South Africa, it can cause havoc when it takes over precious farmland.<br/><br/>Once a year, in the scorching summer months, the beans are ready to be collected and the harvesters must work fast before the animals eat these nutritious fruits.</p><p><br/>​The poorest of the poor within this community get the opportunity to collect the beans which we purchase from them according to the weight they have collected. This helps to provide them with seasonal work and supports their local economy.</p><p>These trees only grow in the wild and are not cultivated, farmed, or nurtured in any way.</p><p> </p><p><strong>2.

</div></div>","The Goal of this Campaign
The reason for this campaign is to raise the funds we need to take MannaBrew to the United States and make this a global project by scaling the awareness, demand, and production of MannaBrew. 
We want to scale up hard and fast, in order to broaden the reach of the positive impact MannaBrew has in its various stages to as many people as possible. This includes creating jobs, having a positive impact on the environment, and helping more people make healthy choices. 
In the end, it is not about how many units have been sold, but how many lives have been changed for the better - that's why we are here. 
 

 

 

 
MannaBrew: The mesquite superfood coffee that's changing the lives of everyone involved. 
We're not another coffee brand trying to convince you that our coffee is the best, because this is NOT coffee in the traditional sense.
MannaBrew is, in fact, made from a superfood known as Mesquite, roasted in almost the same way as coffee. 
So you still get to enjoy a cup of rich, smooth, delicious dark liquid - but it is unlike anything that you have ever tasted before.
To summarise... It looks like coffee, can be brewed by the same methods as coffee, enjoyed the same way coffee would be, but it is a superfood and tastes super good!
""As an avid coffee addict -this is possibly one of the most palatable beverages."" - Joy 

What exactly is ""mesquite""? 

Quite simply, mesquite is a type of thorn tree. It bears its ""fruit"" in the shape of a long, pod-shaped legume. These legumes are what we use to craft the delicious beverage called MannaBrew. BUT the Mesquite tree is an invasive species in South Africa and is using up precious resources on our farmlands!
 
The story of MannaBrew 
We like to break the story behind Mannabrew into four parts, and it goes a little something like this...
1. Harvesting: Wild Harvested

The Mesquite tree is one of the hardiest trees on earth. Its roots can grow up to 50 meters, seeking precious water in desert areas.As an invasive species in South Africa, it can cause havoc when it takes over precious farmland.Once a year, in the scorching summer months, the beans are ready to be collected and the harvesters must work fast before the animals eat these nutritious fruits.​The poorest of the poor within this community get the opportunity to collect the beans which we purchase from them according to the weight they have collected. This helps to provide them with seasonal work and supports their local economy.These trees only grow in the wild and are not cultivated, farmed, or nurtured in any way. 2. Processing: Slow RoastedProcessing the beans is quite a challenge… We first have to clean them, and then they are slow-roasted in a specialized oven at exact temperatures to get the perfect roast.The roasted beans are milled in two stages, with specially made grinders, and then blended to get the right consistency in order to be used in as many different coffee-brewing devices as possible. 3. Packaging: Sustainable & Effective The blended Mesquite Coffee is packed in specially made bags that are designed from fully recyclable materials.MannaBrew has a stated shelf life of 24 months, although it has been tested for up to 48 months, after which it still retains its freshness, flavor, taste, and utility when stored correctly. Unlike coffee, it does not oxidize and lose its flavor over time. This means that it can be kept for much longer - although we doubt that would be the case once you have tasted how delicious it is! 4. The Final Product: Flavor-Rich & Delicious Mesquite CoffeeThe slow roasting process brings out the natural sweetness and unique flavors of this superfood from nature.The Mesquite Coffee has no caffeine, but the essential sugars from the Mesquite beans are known to energize and uplift, similar to caffeinated coffee, but without the negative side effects.Also, MannaBrew will not cause acidity in the body, nor acid reflux.The Mesquite beans are hand-selected in the wild to secure consistent flavor, batch after batch.Once you have tasted the amazing flavor MannaBrew offers, everything else may taste a bit bland in comparison.Love it! You can taste the goodness of this superfood coffee straight away!! Remember it’s stronger tasting than usual coffee, so halve your coffee to water ratio, add a dash of milk, and no sweetener necessary as it’s naturally sweet!! - Lize-Marié      I’m a huge cappuccino fan.

<h3>Short Summary </h3>
<p>My Name is Raymond and I am a Namibian Refugee in the United Kingdom, I've been an asylum seeker since 2016 and received my refugee status 2020. I am a collage trained chef an entrepreneur and a business degree student at the University of London Birkbeck. </p>
<p>Culinary arts training, coupled with 12 years cooking experience and loads of passion, I have the opportunity to launch my Namibian street food business, the first of its kind in the United Kingdom. Through various migrant help entrepreneur support organisations, i was able to build and test my product. I entered a cooking competition and won, the prize is a free stall in a renowned high end street (40 stalled) food market with traffic of 50 000 people a week. For 3 months I have the opportunity to run/trial my business in this market (and else ware) for free (0% commission to the market). In the next 3 years I would like to replicate this street food stall in three different markets around London and continue through out the country!</p>
<p>All I need is saving grace to get the most essential cooking equipment, transportation, stall branding, salaries for 2 people for 1 month and start up stock. These things will not only enable me to successfully launch my business but change my story. Coming from a family of 15 transitioning form Africa to Europe as a refugee, getting an education, surviving, all this has culminated to end of 2021 when my destiny will change and my struggling story rewritten. for this to happen I NEED YOUR HELP!</p>

The berries are also rich in minerals, B-vitamins, high in fiber, very high in protein, and contain a potent amount of Omega-3, Omega-6, and Omega-9 fatty acids. And, if that’s not enough, they also contain a high level of vitamin C, along with a plethora of other powerful nutrients that naturally help boost our immune systems and reduce inflammation.</p><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497152551/bj19emja2sh9jnad7qm0.png"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p><ul>

It has a whopping ORAC score (anti-oxidant value) of approximately 27,600 per 100mg compared to Acai's 16,700. The antioxidants contained in this berry combat free radicals. Maqui berries are also an excellent source of vitamin c, calcium, potassium, and iron. They are sustainably harvested from the Patagonian rain forest in Chile.</p><p><strong>Acai Berry</strong> – our sustainably harvested acai is a low-sugar energy boost which contains minerals that help aid muscle activity and regeneration. The berry is loaded with antioxidants that fight free-radical molecules.  Acai also contains Omega-6 and Omega-9 fatty acids as well as excellent amounts of iron, calcium, fiber, and Vitamin A. </p><p><strong>Green tea</strong> is also a great source of antioxidants that support immune function, cardiovascular health — oh yeah, and fat loss.</p><p><strong>Ginseng</strong> has traditionally been taken in order to aid a number of medical conditions.

Our good friend and co-founder Jorge is from Argentina where Yerba Mate is the national drink. It’s well known for providing a clean energy boost that’s been described as gentle and calm.

Organic on-site inspections account for every component of the operation, including, but not limited to, seed sources, soil conditions, crop health, weed and pest management, water systems, inputs, contamination and commingling risks and prevention, and record-keeping.

IT'S TIME FOR A NEW GENERATION OF ENERGY DRINKS.Our team started LET'S GET GOOD! with the mutual dream that we can create a new generation of healthy beverages. We wanted something better than what we were seeing in the local grocery stores. With our team from South America, we were lucky enough to be introduced to the Maqui Berry. It’s also known as the Patagonian Superfruit — sustainably harvested and blended with our other amazing ingredients. Our sparkling antioxidant beverage will be low calorie, low sugar and use the highest quality ingredients. Yum!A FOUNTAIN OF YOUTHIn our journey to find the best functional ingredients, we were introduced to the Patagonian Superfruit – Maqui Berry. The Maqui Berry is considered to be a “modern day fountain of youth” because of the high level of antioxidants the berries carry. The berries are also rich in minerals, B-vitamins, high in fiber, very high in protein, and contain a potent amount of Omega-3, Omega-6, and Omega-9 fatty acids. And, if that’s not enough, they also contain a high level of vitamin C, along with a plethora of other powerful nutrients that naturally help boost our immune systems and reduce inflammation.
It's time for a new generation of functional organic beverages. Sure there's already some out there — but they taste horrible and the ingredients are not clean.
Our team is comprised of beverage industry pros and millennial entrepreneurs. 
We intend to bring our unique formulation and superior flavors to a store near you.
As a contributor, you can make a difference. You can help us choose our flavors, weigh in on our packaging design, and collaborate with our founders. You can be a part of our movement.
It’s up to you to help this young group of passionate “makers” create a new product for a new generation.
“Our brand is already established in South America. Now it’s time to bring it to California — and beyond.” – Mauricio De Pablo, Co-Founder - LET’S GET GOOD!  THE EXPERIENCE AND THE PASSION:Our team has the passion, skills, and determination to make this brand a reality. We want to raise a million dollars in order to purchase our first batch of product and get it into the retail distribution channels.The funds that we generate will allow us to order our first production batch — and continue our growth, enabling our team to build our dream.

We’re just getting started and you will be a part of this critical moment in our company history.
Let’s come together to create a better tasting, healthier alternative to all of the crappy energy drinks, sodas and nasty tasting so-called healthy energy drinks.
Our team is comprised of beverage industry veterans who have had success launching juices, beers, sodas, teas, coffees, and liquor for some of the biggest brands in the world.
We decided it was time to launch our own brand – but we need your help.

“I went to college in Santa Cruz to study organic farming, I also worked on a farm in Hawaii and worked in Napa making wine. To prepare for our launch, I studied mixology and started mixing ingredients in the kitchen. I studied other brands, researched the best ingredients and crafted the best flavors — using things like ginger, limes, lemons, blood oranges and maqui berries.” – Jackson Patrick, Chief Tastemaker/Mixologist - LET’S GET GOOD!Risks & ChallengesLet’s be honest, it’s not easy to start a beverage company. LET'S GET GOOD! is already an established brand in Chile and Argentina but has not cracked the US market yet. We’ll be competing against some established brands and some organic energy drinks that already have a head start. We know it’s going to be a struggle but we’re willing to work hard and be relentless in our pursuit of greatness…THIS AIN’T OUR FIRST RODEO!
Our veteran team has been in the business for 20+ years. We’ve seen a lot of concepts come and go and we’ve been involved in some doozies.
Our integrated team includes beverage manufacturing, distribution and marketing experts – as well as a veteran financial executive to guide us on this journey.
We already have a solid track record with our juices in South America.

<p>My name is Chibuike Wogu, the managing director of Carl Commodities Nigeria Limited.</p>
<p>I am passionate about processing agricultural products into edible snacks. So for the past five years, I have been working hard to setup a peanut snack processing factory that will process raw peanuts into edible peanut snack.</p>
<p>I strongly believe that achieving my goal of setting up a peanut snack processing factory will be of a great benefit not just to me as an individual and the satisfaction that comes with achieving a set goal but also to the peasant Nigerian farmer who will find market for his farm produce and the jobs my business venture will create for unemployed Nigerians.</p>
<p>Through self-funding, I have successfully purchased the complete set of peanut snack machines production line. My efforts so far serves as a demonstration of my commitment to this project.</p>
<p>Due to the erratic power supply in my location, Lagos Nigeria, I will purchase a 60 KVA power generator set in order to generate reliable electricity to power the machines in the factory for production.</p>
<p>At this stage in the factory setup, I am reaching out to my community of friends and colleagues for financial support to enable me purchase a 60 KVA power generator set, a product distribution van and to print the products packaging materials.</p>
<p>When fully setup, the factory will create five jobs which will be scaled up as I grow the business.</p>
<p>I greatly appreciate your donations to this project and your support in sharing my fundraising campaign on social media using the Indiegogo share tools as I hope to raise $20,000 needed to fully setup my peanut snack processing factory.</p>

<p><strong>TERREPURE AGING PROCESS  </strong></p>
<p>Our aging process reduces several known congeners (such as methanol, isobutanol, amyl alcohols, propanol, and free radicals) to a greater degree than any other industry method. In addition to this reduction of congeners, our technology also induces a conversion of certain harsh-tasting acids to smooth-tasting esters (glycerides). This conversion produces a spirit with a much smoother mouth-feel and dramatically enhanced taste and flavor and results in taste and quality levels that would otherwise take 4-6 years.  </p>

You are so sleepy that you can barely open your eyes. You can't wait to collapse on the desk, but wait, there are piles of files that need you to work on. You turn your head toward the old vending machine in the corner. You drink up the whole can of red bull in a gulp. However, you get nothing but a jittery mind.  You must have suffered from these and so do we. That’s why we want to change the status quo, and that’s why Focuz is created. We want to use our energy tea to improve concentration, lighten anxiety, and eventually, provide a healthy, effective lifestyle. When it comes to energy tea, you may think of energy drink: weird taste, tons of added sugar and chemicals. You are drinking it only because you have to stay awake like a walking dead. You have to stand the jitter and anxiety those energy drinks bring. But no, WE ARE DIFFERENT! Focuz is a healthier, tastier, and effective product compares to traditional “energy drinks"". When drinking Focuz, you’ll feel like drinking a homemade lemon mint tea with a smooth, natural taste: that’s because each can of Focuz is delicately made by tea, mint, and lemon which are all naturally grown in Australia. It‘s going to be the most refreshing thing you’ve ever had.And here comes the key point: The unique energy base of Caffeine + L-theanine + Vitamin B, developed by the industry tycoon, Dohler and us. It is proven to have the effects of focusing, improving alertness, and relieving anxiety. When you are busy with work or study: when you barely got a clue on an essay or project, Focuz will provide you with better concentration, higher efficiency, and a pleasant mood, just to make sure you can finish work on time without getting battered. In your spare time, if you want to play video games, just try focuz, you’ll be surprised by how fast you can react. Most importantly, we care about your health. All ingredients are strictly selected by us, the natural flavor we choose and the natural sweetener we use ensures you a healthy, happy consumption experience. We need you! We need an amazing crowd who want an effective lifestyle to join our community!

<h2>Oy!</h2>
<p>Hello! Thank you for visiting our Indiegogo campaign. We’re incredibly excited to share this with our family, friends and tiki fans alike.</p>
<p>Recently, we’ve developed our budding Promistyx company brand together, which Mistyx Tiki falls under. We’re both big mythology nerds, and the Promistyx name represents a promise we’re making to ourselves to bring this product and this campaign to life.</p>
<p>We have SO MANY great designs, so this campaign will also help in developing future designs and bringing this tiki to (virtual, and someday in-person) shows in the SoCal area.</p>
<p>Thanks for giving us this chance!</p>
<p>Aaron &amp; Jenn</p>
<h2>About the Product</h2>
<p>While we're deep in production on our <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/promistyx/death-blow-cannon-tiki-mug"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">first (and successful) Kickstarter for the Death Blow tiki mug</a> - we were thinking about our Halloween campaign all along. We're not the kind of people who just decorate for Halloween... We're year-round fanatics! And what better way to launch this side of our tiki product line than a design that embodies this crazy year we've all been experiencing: the Plague Doctor.</p>
<p>We've been gobbling up plague doctor merch from our favorite artists and product companies, but we noticed something missing. So here we are. And we're thrilled to finally be sharing it!</p>
<p>Our ""Doctor Plague"" tiki mug will stand at around 8"" tall. Our primary open edition will have a black glossy glaze from head to toe with a bone matte mask and bright red interior. Our second edition variant, the ""Infected Doctor Plague,"" will be filled with bright, poison green interior and a gradient on the bottom, as if he's trudged miles through sickness.</p>
<p>Check out our progress below:</p>

</div></div>","Oy!
Hello! Thank you for visiting our Indiegogo campaign. We’re incredibly excited to share this with our family, friends and tiki fans alike.
Recently, we’ve developed our budding Promistyx company brand together, which Mistyx Tiki falls under. We’re both big mythology nerds, and the Promistyx name represents a promise we’re making to ourselves to bring this product and this campaign to life.
We have SO MANY great designs, so this campaign will also help in developing future designs and bringing this tiki to (virtual, and someday in-person) shows in the SoCal area.
Thanks for giving us this chance!
Aaron & Jenn
About the Product
While we're deep in production on our first (and successful) Kickstarter for the Death Blow tiki mug - we were thinking about our Halloween campaign all along. We're not the kind of people who just decorate for Halloween... We're year-round fanatics! And what better way to launch this side of our tiki product line than a design that embodies this crazy year we've all been experiencing: the Plague Doctor.
We've been gobbling up plague doctor merch from our favorite artists and product companies, but we noticed something missing. So here we are. And we're thrilled to finally be sharing it!
Our ""Doctor Plague"" tiki mug will stand at around 8"" tall. Our primary open edition will have a black glossy glaze from head to toe with a bone matte mask and bright red interior. Our second edition variant, the ""Infected Doctor Plague,"" will be filled with bright, poison green interior and a gradient on the bottom, as if he's trudged miles through sickness.
Check out our progress below:

What we are showing now is the <u><strong>preliminary</strong> design</u> of our fully <u>working <strong>prototype</strong></u>. However, we intend to make the final product twice compact and chill even faster. We will surely make some improvements which we know you'll like. We love hearing from our supporters and if you have any suggestions, we would be more than happy to consider them. As we are in an prototype &amp; initial investment stage only with your support we can make it come to life.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Why can't we just put the bottle inside instead of pouring in the liquid?</strong></p><p>The technology works best in terms of time and exact temperature control with constant contact of the liquid with the chilling surface through our specially designed chilling cup. Bottles come in many different shapes and sizes, which makes designing the chilling cup to fit very tough. You can try to put your bottle inside the device, but we cannot guarantee it will work properly. However this is our dream to make Chill&amp;Cheers bottle-friendly. Such an adoption requires bigger investments. As we see bigger interest in the product, we will <strong>apply</strong> it as our most <strong><u>Desired Stretch Goal</u></strong>! </p><p> </p><p><strong>Will there be different colors available?</strong></p><p>For now, Chill&amp;Cheers will only be available in Black. This decision is grounded on the minimal order pricing requirements. However, because we see a bigger interest in Chill&amp;Cheers based on preorders, we will definitely apply some stretch goals. Some of these will be color-oriented. Just follow the updates of our current page to not miss something new. </p><p> </p><p><strong>What happens if Chill&amp;Cheers doesn't reach its goal?</strong></p><p>We strictly follow the terms and conditions of Indiegogo. You will receive a full refund if the campaign ends without reaching our goal. With your support and sharing the campaign within your network, we are sure to meet the goal and go far beyond!</p><p> </p><p><strong>What about the shipping?</strong></p><p>Chill&amp;Cheers is not a tiny device, so we are forced to apply certain charges for its shipping. As we intend to ship worldwide, we take into consideration the fares of shipment to different locations. We do our best to select the best possible logistic providers in terms of price and quality to ensure the product is delivered safely and quickly.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Who is responsible for taxes and duties?</strong></p><p>The backer is responsible for any additional duties, taxes, and VAT upon the product delivery. Duties, Taxes, and VAT vary from country to country . For example, in the U.S, the taxes, duties, and VAT are 0%.  For other countries, please check the local regulations before purchasing. </p><p> </p><p><strong>What will be the time of beverage chilling?</strong></p><p>Chill times depend on different factors such as the temperature delta (your beverage starting temperature and the set temperature), amount of beverage that needs to be chilled (the less you pour in, the faster it is), outside air temperature, air humidity, and even beverage density (the denser the beverage is, the more time is needed). Our own tests show chill times between 1 to 8 minutes.  </p><p> </p><p><strong>What are the minimal temperatures of chilling I can set?</strong></p><p>The machine is capable of chilling your beverage down to 0 ℉ ( ~ -18 ℃), but this setting increases the risk of damaging the beverage cup or the chilling elements. To keep your device working properly, we have limited the lowest temperature setting to 32 ℉ (0 ℃) in the Chill&amp;Cheers software. Doctors recommend consumption temperatures no lower than 41 ℉ (+5 ℃).If you want a colder drink, check with your doctor to maintain your health.</p><p> </p><p><strong>How do you control the exact temperature of beverage chilling?</strong></p><p>There are two types of temperature sensors: wireless infrared which analyses different layers of liquid, and hard temperature sensors.

Fridge, ice bucket or water? Have you ever frozen your bottle on accident?We used to ask ourselves these questions too and shared your frustration. Now, we don't have to put up with ineffective chilling methods and neither do you!  It's a true game-changer; a device that chills any drink as fast as a kettle heats water, and as portable as a juice-machine!​Reserve your Chill&Cheers today and help us get our project launched.  The sooner we reach our goal, the sooner you'll have the best drink accessory you'll take everywhere you go. What are you waiting for?!  Let's get this party started! Meet the world’s FIRST portable, smart electronic beverage chiller – Chill&Cheers!    DOWNLOAD PRESS RELEASE    Fast Chilling Depending on the amount, type of beverage, and the set temperature delta, the chilling time normally varies from 1 to 8 minutes. Although we have a working prototype, we are still improving the technology to make the serial product faster and more powerful.   No Ice or Water NeededUsually you need ice or cold water to chill your beverage fast. But these methods are messy and inconvenient. Preparation of ice or cold water requires time and effort. Chill&Cheers chills your drink without the effort or mess.   Easy to Use Our goal in designing Chill&Cheers is simplicity. It is easy to operate and clean. Chill&Cheers works like an electronic kettle but in reverse. All interfaces are intuitive and comfortable. It means that together with the fast chilling, you have more time to enjoy your favorite beverage. App Сontrol Chill&Cheers is the first device of its kind. The Chill&Cheers app will be available for both iOS and Android smartphones and operates through Bluetooth interface. The app provides more control and customizable options compared to traditional device buttons. Prefer manual buttons on the device? Those are present too.      Chill to the Exact TemperatureTo experience the full flavor and taste of your drink, you need to chill it to a precise temperature. Other devices on the market offer only a few possible temperatures. Chill&Cheers says YES! to any temperature you set within its working range.  Keep the TemperatureChill&Cheers will maintain the set temperature. If you forget to take the beverage out, or just don't drink the full volume at once, the device will automatically switch on if the temperature changes just one degree.  Chill your drink and have it ready for whenever you need it.     Preset Temperature ModesThe preset feature is exclusive to the app. We're in the process of compiling a  database of the best temperatures for different beverage types: wines, spirits, beers, etc. All you need to do is select the right beverage and click ""Start"". You can also set your own temperature and save it as a preset.  Can't wait to get your Chill&Cheers? Order yours today! Say goodbye to warm or watered down drinks and always enjoy your favorite beverage just the way you like it. ""At the size of a home coffee-machine, Chill&Cheers allows you to chill any drink to the set temperature in minutes.  Just pour your wine, beer, soda, water, gin, or whatever inside, select the mode with an iOS or Android application, and enjoy your beverage at the perfect temperature"". Eugene Lopatin, co-founder.""What we kept in our mind while designing the Chill&Cheers is simplicity. It's so easy to use it's hard to believe. There are plenty of ways to use it - at home, at work, in the gym, or at any place where a refrigerator cannot be installed. It's the perfect gift for wine lovers, or liquor connoisseurs. Moreover, once it cools the drink, Chill&Cheers will keep it cold even if you forget about it.” Pavlo Haiduk,  co-founder.  Chill&Cheers is designed for easy use, giving you more time to relax and enjoy your favorite drinks.    Enjoy chilled drinks in 5 easy steps:STEP 1:  Pour your favorite beverage inside Chill&CheersSTEP 2: Set the target temperature manually, using on-the-device buttonsOR:  Set the temperature with the help of the iOS /Android app, using manual mode or the preset temperatures mode we created. STEP 3: Press START and in just a few minutes, Chill&Cheers gets the work done for you.SPEP 4: Pour the beverage in your glass, sit back, and enjoy!STEP 5: When you're done, wash the chilling container.  It's dishwasher safe! That's all there is to it!    Chill&Cheers uses a technology of thermo-electric phase cooling, which means it doesn’t require any ice, water, compressor or freon gas. Chill&Cheers measures the current temperature of your drink with high-sensitive sensors at different layers. Then you select the preferred temperature and press the ""Start"". Microprocessor controls multiple cooling elements and the express-chilling process by a specially programmed algorythm, which makes it capable to remove ~40000 Jouls of Heat (20 degrees) in a period of 1 to 8 minutes, depending on the beverage type and temperature. After your beverage is chilled – take it out and enjoy it!

 Thank you, people, you're amazing! Will the Chill&Cheers final product vary from the design above?Yes. What we are showing now is the preliminary design of our fully working prototype. However, we intend to make the final product twice compact and chill even faster. We will surely make some improvements which we know you'll like. We love hearing from our supporters and if you have any suggestions, we would be more than happy to consider them. As we are in an prototype & initial investment stage only with your support we can make it come to life. Why can't we just put the bottle inside instead of pouring in the liquid?The technology works best in terms of time and exact temperature control with constant contact of the liquid with the chilling surface through our specially designed chilling cup. Bottles come in many different shapes and sizes, which makes designing the chilling cup to fit very tough. You can try to put your bottle inside the device, but we cannot guarantee it will work properly. However this is our dream to make Chill&Cheers bottle-friendly. Such an adoption requires bigger investments. As we see bigger interest in the product, we will apply it as our most Desired Stretch Goal!  Will there be different colors available?For now, Chill&Cheers will only be available in Black. This decision is grounded on the minimal order pricing requirements. However, because we see a bigger interest in Chill&Cheers based on preorders, we will definitely apply some stretch goals. Some of these will be color-oriented. Just follow the updates of our current page to not miss something new.  What happens if Chill&Cheers doesn't reach its goal?We strictly follow the terms and conditions of Indiegogo. You will receive a full refund if the campaign ends without reaching our goal. With your support and sharing the campaign within your network, we are sure to meet the goal and go far beyond! What about the shipping?Chill&Cheers is not a tiny device, so we are forced to apply certain charges for its shipping. As we intend to ship worldwide, we take into consideration the fares of shipment to different locations. We do our best to select the best possible logistic providers in terms of price and quality to ensure the product is delivered safely and quickly. Who is responsible for taxes and duties?The backer is responsible for any additional duties, taxes, and VAT upon the product delivery. Duties, Taxes, and VAT vary from country to country . For example, in the U.S, the taxes, duties, and VAT are 0%.  For other countries, please check the local regulations before purchasing.  What will be the time of beverage chilling?Chill times depend on different factors such as the temperature delta (your beverage starting temperature and the set temperature), amount of beverage that needs to be chilled (the less you pour in, the faster it is), outside air temperature, air humidity, and even beverage density (the denser the beverage is, the more time is needed). Our own tests show chill times between 1 to 8 minutes.   What are the minimal temperatures of chilling I can set?The machine is capable of chilling your beverage down to 0 ℉ ( ~ -18 ℃), but this setting increases the risk of damaging the beverage cup or the chilling elements. To keep your device working properly, we have limited the lowest temperature setting to 32 ℉ (0 ℃) in the Chill&Cheers software. Doctors recommend consumption temperatures no lower than 41 ℉ (+5 ℃).If you want a colder drink, check with your doctor to maintain your health. How do you control the exact temperature of beverage chilling?There are two types of temperature sensors: wireless infrared which analyses different layers of liquid, and hard temperature sensors. The Chill&Cheers processor utilizes both sensors and knows exactly when to stop.   How do I clean the beverage chilling cup?The cup is easily removed and can be washed either by hand or in the dishwasher. You can also buy additional cups to avoid contamination of different drinks in social situations. The cup surface is made of alloy approved for food and drink use.  How to clean the tap? The tap can be unscrewed easily and washed separately. You can also pour the washing liquid inside the cup and run it through the tap. Be sure to flush the cup and tap with clean water to rinse. Where can I download the Chill&Cheers app?The app will be available for both iOS and Android devices. Download it by scanning the QR code in the owners' manual, which comes inside the Chill&Cheers package. How does Chill&Cheers connect to my phone? Once you install the app, the connection is executed via Bluetooth.  What possibilities does the smartphone application offer?We are working to create a database of the ideal temperatures for each beverage by type, sort, brand, etc. You will be able to access this in the user-friendly menu by beverage type. You can also set desired temperatures manually, and save your own preset modes.",44.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Our family fell in love with Korcula and we make it our home. We came here to the island of Korcula to initiate the spark for a very sustainable and unique project. This is the place where the essence of the island is put together for our premium London dry gin. With the soul of this place, the tradition of the old distillery we will fuse a high-end product that Korcula will be proud of. Ancient Greeks named the island ‘’Kerkyra Nigra’’, what translates to ‘’Black Corfu’’ as island was covered in dense, rich forests. So, it looked dark from the distance. Island is still very much green even to this day, and we are going to make a good use of natural resources.if you look at our video you will see the  diversity of herbs, citrus fruits, lemon, pomace, angelica root, orris, juniper, which will be combined with the pomace. This will give an authentic taste of the island of Korcula to our 007GIN</p>
<p><i><u>Our still </u></i></p>
<p>Korcula is the home of superb wines and famous for its 2,000 years of wine producing tradition, starting from ancient Greeks. On the island you find grapes that grow nowhere else on Earth: <strong>Grk</strong> and <strong>Posip</strong>.</p>
<p>We want to re-use the grape pomace from local farmers to refine and create the base of our gin. This gives us the proud of creating a sustainable project as today the pomace is not entirely used and create the base of circular economy ecosystem on the island.</p>
<p><i><u>Our product </u></i></p>
<p>The 007Gin  is a 100% dry London gin.

<h3><strong>Why The Kivu by Sussen?</strong></h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">I was inspired to develop The Kivu Mason jar French press after breaking too many carafes, and being sorely disappointed with the options available. French press carafes are too fragile, a pain to replace, and cost too much. I want to be able to see what I’m brewing when using a French press, and to easily tell the carafe is clean, so a metal option just won't do.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">I figured someone must have made a Mason jar French press, because it seemed so sensible. They had; it cost $100 and was made of wood. So much for sensible. The only other option was made of siliconized rubber, was not very attractive, and barely worked. Even at $30 it was a waste of money. Neither is available anymore anyway. So, in collaboration with Ratio Product Lab in Atlanta, I made The Kivu.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;text-align: right;"">- John DeMicco, Founder of Susse<span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">n</span></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""> </p>
<h3 style=""margin-left:40px;"">Made of the Right Materials</h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Unlike past attempts at the Mason jar French press, The Kivu by Sussen is reasonably priced and solidly constructed of stainless steel and BPA-free materials. A naturally water-resistant cosy, hand-crafted by the women of The Nziza Collective in Rwanda, provides a stylish grip. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1581795984/a0hnspggsie3ifdvlnyl.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3 style=""margin-left:40px;"">Made with Purpose</h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Through a fortuitous connection via Land of a Thousand Hills Coffee's Do Good Initiative, we were able to establish a partnership with The Nziza Collective in Rwanda. These former victims of abuse produce the cozies for The Kivu. Each cozy earns one woman three days' wage.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1581796323/wv9gbkzw0mli1gbfj71i.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3 style=""margin-left:40px;""> </h3>

</div></div>","Why The Kivu by Sussen?
I was inspired to develop The Kivu Mason jar French press after breaking too many carafes, and being sorely disappointed with the options available. French press carafes are too fragile, a pain to replace, and cost too much. I want to be able to see what I’m brewing when using a French press, and to easily tell the carafe is clean, so a metal option just won't do.
I figured someone must have made a Mason jar French press, because it seemed so sensible. They had; it cost $100 and was made of wood. So much for sensible. The only other option was made of siliconized rubber, was not very attractive, and barely worked. Even at $30 it was a waste of money. Neither is available anymore anyway. So, in collaboration with Ratio Product Lab in Atlanta, I made The Kivu.
- John DeMicco, Founder of Sussen
 
Made of the Right Materials
Unlike past attempts at the Mason jar French press, The Kivu by Sussen is reasonably priced and solidly constructed of stainless steel and BPA-free materials. A naturally water-resistant cosy, hand-crafted by the women of The Nziza Collective in Rwanda, provides a stylish grip. 
Made with Purpose
Through a fortuitous connection via Land of a Thousand Hills Coffee's Do Good Initiative, we were able to establish a partnership with The Nziza Collective in Rwanda. These former victims of abuse produce the cozies for The Kivu. Each cozy earns one woman three days' wage.

 
Sustainable
The spout and plunger assemblies are meant to last. The Mason jar carafe is solid  glass, not borosilicate, so it is 100% recyclable. Another environmental advantage of Mason jars is that they already exist in the market, and don't require additional resources to design, create, or manufacture. The hand-crafted grips are made by the women of The Nziza Collective from natural fibers.
Sensible
You deserve a french press that’s practical, well designed, and isn’t overly expensive, and that’s what we’re making. The spout and plunger assembly are made of solid stainless steel. The dome accents are made using BPA-free food-grade polypropylene. Your coffee brews in contact with just glass and stainless steel, and pours over a stainless steel spout. The carafe is easily replaced for a couple of bucks.
Social Purpose (and the other sustainable)
The Nziza Collective is comprised of several hundred former victims of abuse, who now produce some of the finest coffee in the region, and craft baskets and mugs for sale through Land of a Thousand Hills Coffee during the coffee off-season. By selling components to Sussen directly, as part of our supply chain, they lessen their dependence on just one entity, and take a big step toward self-sufficiency and economic sustainability. By supporting The Kivu, you’re helping create ongoing economic opportunity for these women, and ensuring the sustainability of their business.

 
What We Need & What You Get
We need to raise $65,000 and manufacture 2000 units in order to get The Kivu to you at a reasonable price, while covering the costs of tooling and manufacturing. Tooling - creating the molds and dies for manufacturing - makes up half the cost of The Kivu in this first run; the other half is the cost of manufacturing and parts. In exchange for your support we will provide you with The Kivu itself.

As an extra perk, Nziza Coffee is available as an add-on and as part of a special bundle!
The coffee produced by the Nziza women is some of the highest rated coffee available and produces a brew with floral,tea, and honey notes as French press.

If we don't meet our goal, any money will be refunded and no product will ship. If this happens, we will likely try again at a later time. Again, our ability to manufacture and ship requires us to raise $65,000 in funding through this campaign.

<p>Uncle Budsy's Barbecue has it's roots based in Texas going back to 1964. The original Uncle Budsy has recently passed away at the age of 79. He cooked great tasting BBQ for customers in Dallas for over 45 years with a secret Texas rub of 16 herbs and spices along with a delicious Jamaican flavored glaze and BBQ Sauces that only he could master. Uncle Budsy was a true Pit Master having passed his Texas/Jamaican Secret onto our Founder.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1545334147/v5b5ag7ceznx5tvvimho.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Our founder Michael Davis learned how to cook the great taste of Uncle Budsy's from the master himself at the age of 14 and is carrying on as Uncle Budsy now. He has since moved to Portland, Oregon and teamed up with another Pit Master of 45 years, Chef JP to bring the best BBQ imaginable. And what better place than Portland Oregon where cannabis is legal and BBQ fans can solve their cravings of ""The Munchies"".</p>
<p>Chef JP established his catering business in 1998 and has operated a catering kitchen and specialized in full-service catering and event planning for events in the region both at client sites and street fairs along with event spaces and halls. For most events, Uncle Budsy's Barbecue provides referrals to additional vendors, manages client rental equipment needs and provides event management expertise on the day of the event.</p>
<p>With the legalization of recreational cannabis use in Oregon in 2014, we have plans for establishing a cannabis friendly restaurant under the name Uncle Budsy's Barbecue. Currently public consumption of cannabis and cannabis infused products are still not legal in Oregon but anticipation for that legalization within the next 5 years is expected. Until that time Uncle Budsy's will be a straight Texas Barbecue Restaurant. In the meantime the release of a Cannabis Cookbook and Infused Barbecue Sauces sold in retail cannabis stores along with   catered cannabis dinners hosted in a private cannabis lounge in Portland. These together will allow the connection with the cannabis industry until it is completely legal.</p>
<p>Uncle Budsy's Barbecue will initially only sell traditional non infused barbecue from the restaurant with CBD infused sauces offered online and through health food stores. THC infused sauces can only be sold through licensed retail cannabis stores. In addition we intend to hold monthly private cannabis dinners at our establishment. This until we can also have cannabis infused products on our public menu.</p>

<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>We are raising $60,000 to fund the launch of our BBQ Food Truck and BBQ Sauce Line. This will require $10,000 for a 5,000 gallon run of sauce with our co-packager, $30,000 for the actual truck and finish out, $10,000 for licensing and $10,000 for supplies and marketing.</p>
<p>We are preselling 10ounce bottles of <i><strong>Uncle </strong></i><i><strong>Budsy's</strong></i><i><strong> Original Texas Style BBQ Sauce</strong></i> <strong><i>with the Secrets of Jamaica</i></strong> for <strong>$10</strong> Contribution</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">The Impact</h2>
<p>There is a definite need to bring great tasting BBQ here to Portland as who doesn't like BBQ? I have been vegetarian 4 times in my life the last ending in 2013. Now I am back over to the Dark Side slinging meat dinners to people here in Portland. People love our food and we have a duty to bring that to as many people as possible. In addition this will enhance the local economy and increase jobs in the area. </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>Any new restaurant or food establishment is a risk to success. We intend to establish a brick and mortar restaurant but the proof of concept about our BBQ will be tested on the lower scale of the Food Truck.</p>

Uncle Budsy's Barbecue will initially only sell traditional non infused barbecue from the restaurant with CBD infused sauces offered online and through health food stores. THC infused sauces can only be sold through licensed retail cannabis stores. In addition we intend to hold monthly private cannabis dinners at our establishment. This until we can also have cannabis infused products on our public menu.

We intend to merge Uncle Budsy's into a NASDAQ publicly traded company along with our, cannabis friendly hotel and lounge - www.420HolidayHotel.com a cannabis lounge www.420Holiday.club and our ticket brokerage www.CannaTixx.com
What We Need & What You Get
We are raising $60,000 to fund the launch of our BBQ Food Truck and BBQ Sauce Line. This will require $10,000 for a 5,000 gallon run of sauce with our co-packager, $30,000 for the actual truck and finish out, $10,000 for licensing and $10,000 for supplies and marketing.
We are preselling 10ounce bottles of Uncle Budsy's Original Texas Style BBQ Sauce with the Secrets of Jamaica for $10 Contribution
All contributors of at least $25 will receive a complimentary BBQ Dinner which includes 3 meats and tasty sides.
All contributors of at least $500 will receive a $50 Uncle Budsy's Restaurant Visa gift card.
All $1,000 contributors will receive an advanced copy of our soon to be released cookbook titled: Uncle Budsy's 420 Favorite Cannabis Recipes.
All $2,000 contributors will receive an Uncle Budsy's T-shirt or Baseball Cap with the Uncle Budsy logo.
All $5,000 and up contributors will receive both Uncle Budsy's T-shirt and Baseball Cap with the Uncle Budsy logo, a copy of the Uncle Budsy's 420 Favorite Cannabis Recipes and 5 BBQ Dinner Coupons.
The Impact
There is a definite need to bring great tasting BBQ here to Portland as who doesn't like BBQ? I have been vegetarian 4 times in my life the last ending in 2013. Now I am back over to the Dark Side slinging meat dinners to people here in Portland. People love our food and we have a duty to bring that to as many people as possible. In addition this will enhance the local economy and increase jobs in the area. 
Risks & Challenges
Any new restaurant or food establishment is a risk to success. We intend to establish a brick and mortar restaurant but the proof of concept about our BBQ will be tested on the lower scale of the Food Truck.

<p>I have had an engineering company for 12 years, but this project came from a health issue. The first of January of 2016 I woke up with an excruciating pain in my toe and after getting a checkup from my Doctor he said that I had a high concentration of uric acid. I tried some recommendations but the big surprise was when my grandmother recommended me to use the seed of the avocado to do a Tea, only 4 hours after drinking it, I fell good. I have been using it for 2 years now and I think is a great use for a product that usually goes to the trash.  </p>

<p>I have done plenty of tests, like cutting the avocado seed in smaller parts, letting it dry, drying it on the oven, with similar results. Actually, I have found the best is to cut it in small slices or even chop it and let it dry for a couple of days before doing the tea.   </p>

<p>What surprised me the most was that the flavor is good, I could drink it without any sweetener. But trying to eat the seed directly, the taste is really bitter and very unpleasant. So I think the best option is the tea.   </p>

<p>I plan to use the funding for starting a small production line of avocado seed tea and maybe in the future scale it up.   </p>
<p>I have already quoted some machines to have a production of 45-60 bags, with 3 to 4 grams of tea, per minute and that will be possible with the funding.

<p>I think is a great product, and is not available everywhere in the world. It still needs more tests to know the actual benefits and other things like the expiry date, but as a first step, we can make the tea available. </p>
<p>The biggest risks I see on this project are:<br/>-The delivery of the machines on time and working, I own an engineering company and I know the delivery dates can change but my company is able to do the installation and maintenance of the machines. Also, the delivery times are of 1 month so I am trying to cover the due dates.<br/>-A study to know the components of the seed could make it not suitable for human consumption. I plan to do some of this studies with the universities of my hometown that have food engineers.<br/>-Sourcing the seeds could become difficult if the producers see value on it. I plan to close a good deal and a contract to be sure the sourcing will not be a problem for at least 3 years.</p>

I have 19 years of work experience (as a manager) from Norwegian restaurant industry and more than 7 years of work experience in Information Technology.               https://www.dagsavisen.no/demokraten/nyheter/smart-losning-for-de-sma-1.1434820 . When I was working in the restaurant business (as an owner-manager), I was coming across a number of problems (mentioned below) on the daily basis. Inspite of all the hard work, after almost no family time, with so many repeating problems and with expensive available solutions to run the business every year, I almost had nothing called as savings.One day, I asked myself, how I can address these problems once for all and can have some more time to spend with my family without making my business suffer or using business resources which have always been very limited.               This was the time when I decided to find a solution to these problems and started searching for a reliable and effective solutions to address these problems. After approx. 8 months of research I couldn't find any reliable or effective solution available in the market, but instead I found that it’s not only me who was suffering from such problems, but many other small and medium scaled restaurant owners and managers are also facing the same issues.       Now it was clear to me that I should do something, and I founded OM DATA company to create a solution, after two and half years of research and development my company OM DATA was finally able to develop an ""All-In-One"" digital solution called ORC (OM Restaurant Cloud) for the hospitality industry (restaurants, clubs, pubs, cafes, food-courts, street food stalls etc.). ORC simplifies their work. It is a cutting-edge technology that streamlines the restaurant business to a higher competitive position. Problem we are solving  The hospitality industry is suffering from a number of problems like: 
Every day increasing competition.
Regulatory frameworks. 
Expensive rents.
Overburdened with work.   
High working & maintenance cost. 
Increasing raw-product prices. 
Expensive and complex modular-based solutions from multiple vendors. 
High wastage and paper consumption. 
Poor knowledge of IT and its benefits to their business. 
Poor routines etc.
                                                                All these issues get combined, create a situation wherein the total cost of running a business often exceeds the total income for many small and medium scaled restaurant business resulting in increased debts and consequently forcing the business to close or shut down.            But now these businesses can have a simple, reliable, effective, smart and innovative solution by their side, guaranteeing positive results.  ORC All-In-One Solution ORC will address a number of above-mentioned problems simply by providing knowledge and needed tools of new smart technology, clearly showing & providing huge benefits to their everyday business. ORC has been created after a detailed study and many years of work experience in the restaurant industry.          ORC is a much reasonable and user-friendly digital solution for the hospitality industry than today's single modular-based solutions. ORC will replace complex and single modular-based products and services with an ""All-In-One"" cloud-based solution. ORC is an innovation for the hospitality industry, which guarantees positive results to our customers, our partners, community, environment and our company.                                                                                    With ORC, client company can realize reduction in:
Annual operating expenses.
Paper and paperwork.
Wastage.
Vendors.
carbon foot print.

 ORC creates new value in the form of:
Digitalization of work.
Smart, simple and easy to use back-office.
Simplification of work.
New digital sales channel.
More customer engagement.
Increased efficiency and productivity.
Streamlining communication with employees.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> JS Sweet Spot and Eatery will be a cafe and candy kiosk located in Waco, TX  which will offer a variety of food inside of Richland Mall. Operations will be run by two locals, Stephanie and Jeanette Satchell. This restaurant will be family-friendly, owned, and operated.   </p>
<p>Both girls have backgrounds in business, retail, and foodservice. Always wanting to own a family fun and friendly establishment, both girls decided to open their own restaurant in Richland Mall, with the hopes of going out in their own building off of Elm Street.</p>
<p>JS Sweet Spot and Eatery will feature great food and will be near convenient shopping. When you get hungry and tired of the same meals that are located in Richland Mall, JS Sweet Spot and Eatery will offer a different menu every week to keep things from going down. Stephanie is a great cook with decades of foodservice background and cooking experience. Jeanette is a baker who knows many different ways to make the perfect dessert.</p>
<p>Along with having lots of experience, we know that finances are a must. No matter how much funds you have, you should always assume you need more. There is no end when there is so much to purchase – licenses, equipment, rentals, signage, repairs, insurance, etc.</p>
<p>We are both deeply passionate about cooking and are always learning new and better ways to make a dish.  </p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>We need to raise 50K to get the restaurant up and running, and you can be our biggest contributor. The money raised will be spent on buying deep fryers, chairs, tables, and other things that are needed to open the restaurant.</p>
<p>In a city full of amazing cafes and eateries, JS Sweet Spot and Eatery hopes to bring something different: Once we are able to obtain a building of our own we will be transforming space that, by day, provides everything a great neighborhood cafe can. And by night, a private enclave for friends to gather and create, work, exhibit, or simply relax. Waco has got the talent; let us provide the space, the caffeine, and the tools to utilize and explore those talents.</p>
<p>To be clear: We would never ask for hand-outs - we want you to get exactly what you pay for (and then a whole lot more!).  Our team put together different packages for you to select from.  Whether you're planning a meal for 2 people or a party for 75, we're here to help!   We simply ask that you take a moment to browse the options and consider supporting JS Eatery by pre-purchasing breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner, or party.  Make it an epic shindig, a romantic gesture, a surprise party, a birthday celebration, an event just because, or a one-of-a-kind gift....you can't go wrong here folks! And even just a simple donation will do.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By helping us, you are not only helping support a black-owned business, but you will also support the jobs that it provides. You are helping to bring joy to family everywhere to have the opportunity to enjoy meals more than in the past.</p>
<p>Later, we plan to open a different location and have different acts come up and perform, whether it is comedy night, soul night, family fun night, etc., we will build to last. </p>
<p>JS Sweet Spot and Eatery will be a community-focused café. We will buy all our meat and ingredients from local producers and we also employ our local youth as young as 14. This will allow them to enter the workforce and learn the way to make a dollar.</p>
<p>We will also support local community projects, promote local businesses, and contribute tremendously to our local youth. But we need your help. </p>
<p>We created this campaign as a way for you to plan for those good times ahead by pre-purchasing an activity at JS Sweet Spot and Eatery (at a discount!).  This, in turn, helps us to support our staff during this down-time and make the process of opening much quicker.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The main risk and challenges that will arise is another pandemic. A time where unemployment and quarantine is a must. People will always need food and time out of the house, when they visit the mall (while we are there) then they will see a great place to eat. When the time comes (when we open at a different location), people will be able to come out and enjoy a night out alone, in a group, in family settings, or even just a date. There will always be risks and challenges, however, we are willing to fight through them and overcome the obstacles. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We need your financial support. If you can’t do it, that is ok, but we ask that you please help us spread the word by sharing this fundraiser on your Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram pages to help us reach our goal. Any amount can help.</p>

With such a daily structure, life can feel stable. Having a steady paycheck and not having the success of the company you work for relying solely on you can be a comfortable routine. However; comfort, ease and predictability aren't what drive me. I feel unchallenged and dissatisfied with my life. There has to be more for me.</p></div><div>
<p>Just like me, there are many people who didn't feel like they fit in at a full-time job, working for someone else. Rather than giving in or giving up, they chose to go the exhilarating (and often unpredictable) route of becoming an entrepreneur instead.</p>
<p>I would rather be independent, looking after myself instead of being observed by higher-ups. I can build something from scratch. I'll feel a sense of satisfaction when I accomplish something. If I don't meet my quarterly earnings goal - it falls on me. Working at a company, on the other hand, is a group effort. And I feel like just another clog in the machine.</p>
<p>I don't fit into one job description. I am multi-talented and don't want to be pigeonholed as an accountant or data entry clerk. I believe I know how a business should be ran (I mean after all, I studied accounting and business as a major) and this motivates me to get directly involved. Instead of hitting my head against a wall when my boss makes a mistake, I can take charge and do it my own way.</p>
<p>I know that opening a business isn't easy, but I am truly passionate about it and there's no time like the present. I'm hungry to start a business and lead it to success. I'll stop at nothing to make this dream a reality.</p>
<p>Did you know that Americans alone consume about 400 million cups of coffee every single day? Demand for specialty coffee and espresso-based drinks continues to solidify. And today, more than ever it seems that many of our communities are hurting. Many of our neighbors are struggling.</p>
<p>A well located coffee shop that is welcoming and that offers a safe place to meet can make all the difference. There is something very powerful about creating a space that is meaningful to others too. A successful coffee shop can change a neighborhood. A coffee shop business that transforms a community is incredibly valuable . Coffee is all about community. I'd be socializing with neighbors and those just passing through. Overtime, I'll get to meet many wonderful people that I would never have gotten to meet otherwise. Some will become my regulars, others will drop by to say hello and give me updates on their life. Coffee brings many people together and my business will be no different.</p>
<p>We all want to feel connected. And the best part is - I'll be getting paid to connect and socialize with my neighbors. Today, more than ever, we need to feel connected to others. While many people love to shop online, get their news online and work alone, they still want to feel a sense of community. Perhaps my coffee will draw people closer together.</p>
<p>I love coffee! I know that coffee is a wonderful, magical, mystical and enchanting product. And it is super easy to fall in love with it and be passionate about it. I want to share my love of coffee with you! I want to bring great coffee to people who don't have access to great coffee. What can be better then that?</p>
<p>Did I mention that my business will have a tremendous impact on the lives of others? It can boost economic and social activity. I'll hire staff and/or baristas. I'll contribute to my local tax base and generally uplift the community. And to top it off, I'll be providing an excellent service and delivering a great product to my customers that they are going to love.</p>

<p>I believe most consumers truly want to help impact the environment, but we need convenient and transparent solutions to drive positive agricultural change. Being a father and entrepreneur, by the time I go shopping, I have little time and energy to read labels and research products on my phone.  Biodynamic certification is the most thorough and transparent certification that provides me with the trust I need to feel confident in my food.  </p>
<p>Our first offering is micro roasted Biodynamic coffee from La Chacra D'Dago in Peru delivered in a 100% compostable bag.  La Chacra is a single origin, shade grown and washed Arabica bean.  We just received 600 kilos of Biodynamic beans stored in Providence, Rhode Island, and they are ready to be micro roasted in 20 pound batches. </p>
<p>Last Spring, I visited the Biodynamic food forest of La Chacra D'Dago, located 1,550 meters above sea level in the mountains of Peru, just outside the Amazon rainforest.  I personally worked with Dagoberto Marín and his family on their coffee farm to learn about their Biodynamic process.  Dagoberto and his sons Eduardo and César manage the farm operation with the help of about 10 families who live on-site and send their children to school in nearby Villa Rica.</p>

I am Mike Liberatore, a proud father, former food activist and CrossFit gym owner.  I have a passion for living vibrantly and hope to enjoy the beauty of our natural planet with my family as I grow old. I am tired of shopping and constantly asking ""Is this food healthy?"" ""How is this affecting the environment?"" ""Am I hurting our ecosystem?"" 
So, I decided to invest into Biodynamic agriculture to procure food that positively impacts our lives and planet.  1% of all our proceeds will benefit the Biodynamic Association to empower new Biodynamic farmers.

Mike, Liz and Luca Liberatore
I believe most consumers truly want to help impact the environment, but we need convenient and transparent solutions to drive positive agricultural change. Being a father and entrepreneur, by the time I go shopping, I have little time and energy to read labels and research products on my phone.  Biodynamic certification is the most thorough and transparent certification that provides me with the trust I need to feel confident in my food.

Our goal is to raise $12,000 in capital through pre-sales in order to increase our economies of scale.  We will use the capital to source larger quantities and more varieties of Biodynamic coffee.  Your support will help us reduce cost while maintaining our commitment to quality and expand our support for regenerative agriculture.

We are offering Medium and Medium-Dark roasts to accentuate the optimal flavor profiles of the La Chacra bean thanks to our roasting partner:  Borealis Roasting.  The Medium Roast offers a medium body with notes of dark chocolate, caramel and citrus peel.  The Medium Dark Roast presents a full body with notes of chocolate, nuts, and molasses.  La Chacra can be brewed well with any method.  Our friends and family have described La Chacra as ""smooth"" or ""low-acid"" and often drink it black when they normally would use milk or sugar.

How Does Biodynamic Impact The Ecosystem?
Biodynamic is a form of agriculture that goes beyond organic, providing a highly beneficial impact to our ecosystem.  Biodynamics mimic the natural environment, requiring a whole system utilizing organic-only inputs and a biodiverse environment.  The result is a rich habitat for plants and wildlife to flourish - including coffee.  Biodynamic certification is conducted and enforced by Demeter International, a private non-profit entity.

<p>Every worthwhile space voyage needs a mission name, and ours is ‘Vostok’. Back in 1961, humanity’s first ever manned space flight was aboard the vessel ‘Vostok’. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_Gagarin"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Yuri Gagarin</a> returned safely home after 90 minutes of flight and became a global legend.</p>
<p>Whilst looking down on Earth, the only thing that was missing to toast the occasion was space beer.</p>
<p>So why Space Beer you ask? </p>
<ul><li><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522755258/au0rdqphtcw7imm3rgbm.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></li></ul>
<p>More recreational space flights have been booked than there have been astronauts in space in the last 57 years. With space tourism a burgeoning reality and hundreds of rejoicing, happy space fans booked on suborbital flights, we wanted to be well prepared. </p>
<p>Imagine if you were one of these future tourists…</p>
<ul><li><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522755286/yttvn557a7xhkktxhgkl.jpg"" src=""""/></li></ul>
<p>From the dawn of civilisation, humanity brewed beer and wherever we venture, beer follows. Fast forward to today and off the back of those hefty space travel ticket prices, you’d want to be drinking the good beer you drink at home – and if it’s tasting good down here, imagine how it’d be up there, with views of our big blue globe!</p>
<p>We initially set out to create a beer that could be drunk in space and with that achieved, the next step was to develop technology that would allow people to drink the stout, or any liquid for that matter, from a bottle like their fellow land-dwellers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522283375/wswxkphdjfbig1xy5w55.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>There were two major challenges we needed to solve to be successful:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522801528/mjvswufde60ggvlnhq3w.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Alcohol absorption by the human body is different. The tongue swells, the senses dull – altering the way food and drink tastes and wet burps (belching both liquid &amp; gas) are a real thing - so we had to re-imagine beer from scratch.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522801549/f1ahjrdtc39sakfia7xz.jpg"" src=""""/><br/>The biggest challenge is liquid’s inability to pour in zero gravity. This means that to drink beer from a bottle the same way that you do on Earth, a special space beer bottle needed to be created. <i>""It’s basically like making a fuel tank for your beer""</i>.​</p>

<p>Off the back of those hefty space travel ticket prices, you’d want to be drinking the good beer you drink at home – and if it’s tasting good down here, imagine how it’d be up there, with views of our big blue globe.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1523071090/wg9n7z1alp3llia2xljq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>It’s been a labour of love, a fine art – making a beer that can be enjoyed on earth as it is in the heavens. Human biology changes in zero gravity conditions. The tongue swells, the senses dull – altering the way food and drink tastes.</p>
<p>So what does the beer taste like? Well…out of this world! But seriously the baseline recipe is a dry Irish style Stout made with a seven-strong malt line-up. We picked a high flavoured beer as the baseline recipe to ensure that space travellers could enjoy the full flavour of the smoky Irish style Stout, no matter how long the flight duration. The aroma profile is of coffee, chocolate and caramel malts. These are matched on the palette with a full bodies, smooth finish and a balancing bitterness.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>Once we validated the beer recipe, the next step was to develop technology that would allow people to drink the stout, or any liquid for that matter, from a bottle like their fellow land-dwellers. Because those hard-working astronautics shouldn’t have to drink their award winning beer from a ‘squeeze’ bag. They deserve a real bottle to let them kick back and feel at home.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522757478/oyeyluuibwdprxpms7d5.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>And here is the challenge - liquid needs gravity to pour, so how do you get the beer out of the bottle, with it feeling like a normal bottle?  Squeegies, plungers, and springs only take away from that home feeling we want the astronauts to have.  And they also add pressure to the beer in ways we don’t want.</p>
<p>So to answer this question, the space ninjas, our partners at <a href=""https://saberastro.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Saber Astronautics</a> decided to use the forces available to us.  And that means surface tension, that mysterious elf who causes beer to cling to glasses on Earth, is a force to recon with in space.  Saber made an insert that can wick the beer from the bottom of the bottle to the neck, turning any normal bottle into a fuel tank for your beer.</p>

</div></div>","“More people have booked recreational space flights than there have been astronauts in space over the past 57 years. And just like we saw in commercial aviation history, space travellers are going to want to enjoy certain creature comforts, like good beer, while enjoying their suborbital experience.” J. Mitchell.
 

 
Hi! We’re 4 Pines Brewing Company (beer lovers) and Saber Astronautics (space gurus) from Manly, Australia on Sydney’s Northern Beaches. We’ve joined forces and we’re on a mission of galactic proportions. We are destined to go where humanity never has before and create the world’s first beer for space!

 
Every worthwhile space voyage needs a mission name, and ours is ‘Vostok’. Back in 1961, humanity’s first ever manned space flight was aboard the vessel ‘Vostok’. Yuri Gagarin returned safely home after 90 minutes of flight and became a global legend.
Whilst looking down on Earth, the only thing that was missing to toast the occasion was space beer.
So why Space Beer you ask? 

More recreational space flights have been booked than there have been astronauts in space in the last 57 years. With space tourism a burgeoning reality and hundreds of rejoicing, happy space fans booked on suborbital flights, we wanted to be well prepared. 
Imagine if you were one of these future tourists…

From the dawn of civilisation, humanity brewed beer and wherever we venture, beer follows. Fast forward to today and off the back of those hefty space travel ticket prices, you’d want to be drinking the good beer you drink at home – and if it’s tasting good down here, imagine how it’d be up there, with views of our big blue globe!
We initially set out to create a beer that could be drunk in space and with that achieved, the next step was to develop technology that would allow people to drink the stout, or any liquid for that matter, from a bottle like their fellow land-dwellers.
 

 
There were two major challenges we needed to solve to be successful:

Alcohol absorption by the human body is different. The tongue swells, the senses dull – altering the way food and drink tastes and wet burps (belching both liquid & gas) are a real thing - so we had to re-imagine beer from scratch.
The biggest challenge is liquid’s inability to pour in zero gravity. This means that to drink beer from a bottle the same way that you do on Earth, a special space beer bottle needed to be created. ""It’s basically like making a fuel tank for your beer"".​
 

 

We have been working on Vostok Space Beer for the past six years and we’ve come a long way. But now we want you to join the journey. Your support will allow us to initiate tooling and manufacturing so we can make Vostok Space Beer available to. With your backing, you can play a small role in sending the comforts from home with those who venture beyond our planet. You can know the impact you’ll have on not just us, the beer and space community, but beyond even our own planet, and the future of space travel and research.
For the love of beer, and on to space!


To do and own something that no human on the planet has ever done before
Be the first to get your hands on the world’s first beer for space.
You’ve got a ticket to ride and you think it’d be awesome to drink beer on your space flight.
You love beer.
You love space.
You want to support fun innovations like this so we can do more fun stuff that just makes the whole world a bit more fun.

 



JUNE 2010. Vostok is Born!

JULY 2010. First batch of 500 cases of Stout are bottled. Four small 5L kegs are prepped for testing and experimentation.

SEPTEMBER 2010: Astronauts4Hire (A4H) selected from a short-list of over 50 applicants to be the official Vostok in-flight beer taster and Zero gravity researcher.

NOVEMBER 2010: To understand the physical and chemical responses of beer in zero gravity we dropped the beer off a 23m drop tower (to simulate the effect of zero gravity).

DECEMBER 2010: A tester from A4H undergoes measurements of his body’s normal terrestrial responses to drinking.

FEBRUARY 2011: Microgravity test complete and history is made! This hits two milestones. It was humanity’s first look at alcohol absorption effects in zero gravity. It is also the first beer in aviation history to be formally tested on a commercial microgravity flight.

MAY 2011: Distribution of the stout (baseline Earth version) goes National in Australia.

SEPTEMBER 2011: Set the R&D plan for the Space Beer Bottle. With a literature review, concept to full spec design, engineering, test phases; it’s like making a fuel tank for your beer.

MAY 2012:  GOLD MEDAL and trophy winner at the Australian International Beer Awards. This beer is now officially the #1 Stout amongst a competitive set of beers from all over the world


JUNE 2012: Saber Astronautics completed the first phase on the Space Beer Bottle. The design passes simulation analysis to include vibration, fluid flows and surface tension.

SEPTEMBER 2012: Fresh off the press is the 3D printed Space Beer prototype. We took it to the 4 Pines filler machine to test the fittings.

DECEMBER 2012: We’ve narrowed down several concept CAD sketches for the Space Beer Bottle Insert.

NOVEMBER 2013: Saber Astronautics flies two prototypes with a highly successful ZERO-G test flight. One prototype 3D printed, one out of medical grade stainless steel.

FEBRUARY 2015: Industrial Design of the Space Beer Bottle begins, with the help of our pals at AUXILIARY and a design is selected. This then leads to concept refinement and down-selection to two bottle design options.

SEPTEMBER 2017: Scoured the planet for over a year on a journey to find manufacturers that were capable to build the world’s first beer for space.

JANUARY 2018: Industrial Design Engineering completed for two viable build configurations ready for high fidelity prototype testing in Zero Gravity
 

 
Off the back of those hefty space travel ticket prices, you’d want to be drinking the good beer you drink at home – and if it’s tasting good down here, imagine how it’d be up there, with views of our big blue globe.

It’s been a labour of love, a fine art – making a beer that can be enjoyed on earth as it is in the heavens. Human biology changes in zero gravity conditions. The tongue swells, the senses dull – altering the way food and drink tastes.
So what does the beer taste like? Well…out of this world! But seriously the baseline recipe is a dry Irish style Stout made with a seven-strong malt line-up. We picked a high flavoured beer as the baseline recipe to ensure that space travellers could enjoy the full flavour of the smoky Irish style Stout, no matter how long the flight duration. The aroma profile is of coffee, chocolate and caramel malts. These are matched on the palette with a full bodies, smooth finish and a balancing bitterness.

5.1% Alc/Vol | 40 IBU
""A dry Irish style stout, presenting almost black & bearing a generous tan head. Aromas of coffee, chocolate and caramel are matched with a full bodied mouthfeel, a smooth finish and rounding bitterness""
 

 

 
We're pretty stoked with our recipe for space, and it seems others' are too! We're humbled to have received many Beer Industry Awards:

2012| GOLD CHAMPION | Australian International Beer Awards (AIBA)
2013 | SILVER | Australian International Beer Awards 
2014 | SILVER | Australian International Beer Awards 
2015 | SILVER | Australian International Beer Awards 
2015 | SILVER | Craft Beer Industry Awards (CBIA)

 

 

Engineered and designed especially for drinking beer in space, the Vostok Space Beer bottle uses modified technology based on fuel tanks to defy the challenges of drinking in zero gravity​.

 
 
Once we validated the beer recipe, the next step was to develop technology that would allow people to drink the stout, or any liquid for that matter, from a bottle like their fellow land-dwellers. Because those hard-working astronautics shouldn’t have to drink their award winning beer from a ‘squeeze’ bag. They deserve a real bottle to let them kick back and feel at home.

And here is the challenge - liquid needs gravity to pour, so how do you get the beer out of the bottle, with it feeling like a normal bottle?  Squeegies, plungers, and springs only take away from that home feeling we want the astronauts to have.  And they also add pressure to the beer in ways we don’t want.
So to answer this question, the space ninjas, our partners at Saber Astronautics decided to use the forces available to us.  And that means surface tension, that mysterious elf who causes beer to cling to glasses on Earth, is a force to recon with in space.  Saber made an insert that can wick the beer from the bottom of the bottle to the neck, turning any normal bottle into a fuel tank for your beer.
*Please note that current images and footage here of Vostok Space Beer are prototypes and as such, the end product may slightly differ.
 

 

 
After successfully creating a flavourful, award-winning beer for space, we’re now in the final stages of testing and developing the technology that will allow space travellers to drink the beer in the same way as we do on Earth. We’re on a mission to make the World’s First Beer for Space become a reality!

8 years of Brewers and Space Engineers time to develop, test and approve:

Space Beer recipe
Wicking insert for bottle
Bottle design

We currently have a working prototype and we're now focused on:

Finalising the engineering schematics for final bottle production
Designing packaging
Developing the beer filling process
Tooling
Materials procurement
Bottle production



Filling the bottle with beer!
Sending some lucky punters into space, to drink the first space beer!

We are doing something that has never been done before: beer in space. While there may be manufacturing and production delays outside of our control, we promise timely and transparent communication throughout the process.

We would talk about space, we would talk about beer, we would talk about other things as well. Luckily the head of Saber is a PhD and has about 15 degrees otherwise we may have never have got to this point. One day he asks the 4 Pines founder “so how would you like to put your beer into space?” Pure Genius.
In addition to our core Space Beer team, we've assembled an incredible group of engineers, designers, and industry experts who are collaborating with us to bring Space Beer to infinity and beyond!

<h3><strong>The Very Best Glass</strong></h3>
<p>The heart of the Kramstein is the glass. <strong>Our 5mm Borosilicate is the very best glass you can get.</strong> The glass is suspended by ionomer bushings, within a 6061 T6 alloy frame, and fastened with stainless steel hardware.</p>

<p>The alloy frame that holds our glass, is machined from 6061 T6 Aluminum. As machinists, we wanted a strong metal frame holding our thick glass. Anodized for a strong finish, and fastened together with stainless steel hardware, the result is eye-catching and will last a lifetime.  </p>

<p>When you find that special beer you've been wanting to try, you'll want it to be the very best experience possible. Imagine drinking from a weighty stein, that won't rotate in your grip, or get clammy and cold. The solid metal frame feels great to hold.

<p>We're machinists and designers working and living in the San Jose Bay Area, and have been building products for others for over 20 years. We've even worked on a few successful Indiegogo products. Now we're making our steins, and hope you will join us. </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>FAQ</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1. Have your shipping prices changed?</b></p>
<p>Yes! We have teamed up with shipbob.com, and we are now able to ship our steins at lower prices than previously shown. We have notified those of you who backed us prior to our change, and will make certain that all of our backers get the improved shipping prices. </p>
<p><strong>2. What are the major risks to production and timely delivery?</strong></p>
<p>The major risk in a delay in production, is how quickly we can receive the glass, if we were to receive orders for a very large number of steins. We have worked very hard to resolve all the major issues, and we believe that we can deliver as expected.</p>
<p>The second risk, would be if we surpassed the $17,500 mark, but do not go higher than $30k. This will mean we would need to use our staged-tooling, which would require more quality assurance, and take a bit longer to deliver parts. Manufacturing always comes with issues that require attention. We now have a very good working relationship with our vendors, and expect that we can deliver great product on time.  </p>
<p><strong>3. Was this campaign previously run on Kickstarter?</strong></p>
<p>Yes.<strong> </strong>We originally launched the Kramstein on Kickstarter in January 2017. We quickly reached $11,251.00, but could not move further at that time. </p>
<p><strong>4. What changes have you made?</strong> </p>
<p>We have changed every single part of our design. We have reduced the part count, greatly improved the quality of the glass, and simplified the design. </p>
<p><strong>5. How can you afford to run the campaign for nearly half the cost of the first campaign?</strong></p>
<p>A full run of production tooling will still cost us $30k. We have moved our injection-moulding to a staged-setup. For any parts produced between $17,500 and $30k, we will use a short-run tool that is far less expensive. When we surpass the $30k mark, we will be able to use the full production tooling once again. Either way, we will be able to deliver steins to you.</p>
<p><strong>6. Will steins be available for sale outside of crowdfunding? </strong></p>
<p>When we succeed, and after every single backer has their stein and is happy with it - only then we will begin selling steins from our website. If the shipping costs deter you from backing us now, we hope you will look for us when we succeed, and larger distribution absorbs those costs. </p>

<p>   <strong>  IT'S A GENERATION * Z * FRANCHISING COMPANY!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div><p> </p></div>","My name is Robert Rupnik. I am a serial entrepreneur. My first businesses were begun in early 90's. I am an alumnus of Faculty of Electrical Engineering at the University of Ljubljana, Slovenia, EU. For the last twenty - five years I was actively running companies professionaly dealing with designing and manufacturing  of  Material handling products - plastic crates equipped with RFID systems, Biblioteca - RFID automatic library systems, High -Tech packaging machinery, Robotic systems , Material handling, Supply Chain management and Logistics in general. My professional career comprises good understanding of the matter and astounding achievements in all these fields.

I can calmly say, that I am an Optimistic Thinker, who can create a Compelling Vision of the future, with an Initiative. I enjoy being in charge and making decisions, and yes I am motivated to lead. Of course I am Self-motivated and Energetic too, and prepared to work hard, for a very long time, to realize my goals and goals of my Team. I am able to take Risks, and make Decisions, plus that I am Resilient as well. 
This is also a family business.
We all love to cook, especially my nephew, Alen who is actually generating his own recipes and is a proud member of top 13 amateur chef selection of MasterChef Slovenia season 1 in year 2015. He also joined this project as an important team member. 

Alen is following his motto ""Food is Chemistry"" faithfully.
He participated in school competitions, where he achieved some bronze and silver prizes from mathematics and physics, and also won gold award in logic. He led some school events, where he gained some experience in public speaking. He's always been interested in chemistry, on the basis of which he continued his studies. Alen is a Student at The Faculty of Chemistry and Chemical Technology of the University of Ljubljana. He is currently attending a master's degree program. 
He's done diverse student work, such as promotion, tasting, sales promotion, storage, easier construction work, work and production management. He is a team player, but he can also work independently. He has been participating in the Celje Students' Club as an activist and a member of the Supervisory Board for the fourth year where he has already organized many independent youth projects and gained experience in the field of organizing. As a member, he was able to attend various lectures and workshops on the topic leadership skills and teamwork.
He can recognize opportunities.
Alens's main hobby is cooking. From the beginning, he was inspired to create and bake cakes or various confectionery. Later, he was also overwhelmed by a bit more serious cooking, which led him all the way to participation in the MasterChef Slovenia competition, 1st season, where he passed the top 13. amateur chefs in Slovenia. He confirms his passion for cooking by stating :
""Now I am most pleased to discover and refine new cooking technics. I love cooking Italian food, I simply admire Italian cuisine, preparing those real, original pizzas and homemade pasta. Recently, I've been discovering techniques and secrets of molecular cuisine.""
Beside that he emphasizes :
""Due to the experience and competences I have received so far, I am ready to take responsibility and cooperation with others, as well as scheduling work tasks and timely adjusting of my obligations. I love team work, I am pleased to create, explore and invent new things.""                                                                                                           
Alen also loves to play in theater roles and to appearing in movies. He was a member of the Youth theaters of Pandam, under whose auspices they have performed a famous drama: ""The event in the City Goga"". He also performed in a very known Slovenian series: ""Carps are there, Esoxs are not"", by Tone Partljič.
Peter is Alen's father. He is a Graduated Engineer of Mechatronics with many pronounced qualities.

The campaign is so important to me, because I would like to prove myself, that the business is manageable at the global level and because, I would like to offer really good service to Pizza eaters and other Italian cusine lovers from one side and always to deliver highest quality product and best service to the other. In addition, we are introducing new technologies, that will save consumer time and reduce costs when ordering quality foods.

One can say one thing : YES WE CAN! 
 


We would like to gather up at least USD 99,000.
We gonna spend it on an application production, on setting up the entire system, on marketing activities, to establish a network of azzPIzza bakeries. Additionally we will spend money on related travel expenses in terms of quality check of the suppliers and signing the contracts on site to secure early business operation.
Of course we are offering very unique perks to all of you, who believe in our idea and who are prepared to contribute to the goal.
From simple azzPIzza Pizza deliveries..........................The regular price is planned not to exceed 9.90 USD / EUR  ( depending on the market  ) per one of our 7 standard weekly available Pizzas plus one extra < Pizza of the week > at the reduced price of 9.00 USD as a Perk No.2,

*Just in case we wouldn't be able to deliver Pizzas at the territory you are comming from yet , we will replace this perk by delivering an azzPIzza T - Shirt to you. 
We consider adding one more attractive perk. A Perk No.7 is the REAL GOLD azzPIzza Party for a backer and 20 of his friends for $1000 starting bid.
By the way, have you ever eaten GOLD leaves ?

When people say that it is impossible, I really start.<br/>From the first drawing to the finished prototype it was an exciting journey. It should be more a finger exercise for future projects. But it turned out that there is actually a market for the 100l champagne bottle.<br/>To bring the bottle into serial production and filling exceeds my present manufacture.</p>
<p>Therefore I hope for your support. I need a new room, tools, professional carbon processing tools and a larger paint booth.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 01/23/20</strong>-  we are halfway thru design with no major problems per the engineering team in Silicon Valley  !! </p>
<p>Recently I was shopping for my grandson a consistent, easy way for preparing bottles.  I could not believe that not much had changed since 1983.....the methods were still the same.  The bottles looked a little different, but that is it!  The following morning I got up and prepared a cup of coffee.  The light went off in my head, if I can make the perfect cup of coffee like this, we can make the perfect bottle like this too.  The sketch is my rough idea of how this looks.  However, we are sticking to contemporary clean lines and an interchangeable panel that will slide over the spout to coordinate with your kitchen,.  With over 3.8 million births in the United States per year we feel this is a winner.  </p>
<p>Our goal is to make an easier life for the new parents.  One that you do not need to guess, is the bottle too hot, is the formula mixed properly, has it been opened too long in the refrigerator?  We want to take the guess work out of feeding, and put the time back in your hands to love on that new baby!  </p>
<p>We currently in the prototype stage and working with Rabbit Designs in Silicon Valley.  We have a panel of five engineers whom seem very excited about the project.   The engineers have told us that ""The engineering aspect of this is simple, we just need to design the machine in the look you want"".   We hope to be on the market by Christmas 2020.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $75,000 to get the working prototype and  2,000 machines manufactured and to the shelves.  We are offering the machines at 1/2 price, or $150.00 to each backer up that donates at least $150.00 to the campaign.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your donation will have a huge ""bearing"" on the outcome of this machine.  We have taken it to the prototype stage but need help to finish the product.  You can Donate any increment to the project because you believe in it, or you can purchase a Baby Bearig for $150.00.  </p>
<p>Baby Bearig Joins Makers of Enfamil, Mucinex, and Airborne to partner with TerraCycle to recycle all Baby Formula Packaging.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our biggest challenge is raising the funds to get the prototype perfected.  We have been told that the prototype is really just to find its flaws and it may take 2-3 tries to get it perfected.  </p>
<p>The next step is to get a license agreement with a formula manufacturer.  We are launching the machine with a reusable pod, but were hope to have a disposable pod system before we hit the market!  We are currently working on that.  </p>

<h3>OCO Introduction:</h3>
<p>We are OCO, a brand that is dedicated to artisan production of vegan and keto food, as well as food for diabetics. After a fruitful research, we have developed several powdered mixes for breads and desserts, very beneficial for keto diets, for people who follow a gluten-free diet and for diabetics, but that can also be used by anyone who cares about their health, we obtained a health score according to USDA of 9.9 out of 10. In this way each person can enjoy a healthy life without limitations. Beyond living, it is a healthy body and a healthy mind. At OCO we create products that feed your body and mind, keeping you prepared for any adversity that your body may face in your day-to-day life.</p>
<h3>Our Chef &amp; Products Introduction:</h3>
<p>My name is Albertto and I am dedicated to the world of professional cooking now for more than 12 years. I have practiced my cooking skills in places like Alicante - Spain and Dubai - UAE. I am also certified as a national fitness and bodybuilding coach by IFBB, for more than 17 years. After all my professional career I have decided to put all my knowledge and experience in the service of those who care about their health, their life and their well-being and I have created the OCO brand.</p>
<p>After a long research, tests and a lot of work, we have developed a product especially dedicated to people who follow a ketogenic diet or follow a gluten-free diet or for people suffering from diabetes.</p>
<p>As you know, the ketogenic diet is a diet that many people follow today and is a diet as an alternative to intermittent fasting. This diet was originally designated for those suffering from epilepsy and today it has been taken again into consideration as a remedy in the fight against of this disease. But seeing its benefits and its importance for our health, doctors and nutritionists have begun to recommend the diet to all those who want to improve their appearance and physical condition. Several studies have shown its benefits at the cognitive level, in the treatment of breast cancer and in the fight against obesity.</p>
<p>Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease characterized by a permanent and chronic intolerance to gluten. It is suffered by people who are genetically predisposed and is characterized by a lesion of the mucosa of the small intestine that causes atrophy of the intestinal villi. This atrophy produces an inadequate absorption of the nutrients from the food we eat (proteins, fats, carbohydrates, mineral salts and vitamins), with the consequent associated health problems. An accidental ingestion of gluten by these people causes chronic diarrea, abdominal bloating, constipation, nausea and vomiting, anemia, generalized weakness, skin rashes, constipation, headache, tooth enamel changes, rickets, spontaneous fractures and can even lead to death. One in 100 people in the world suffer from this disease and each year it increases by 15%. But to this disease is added another one that is a sensitivity to gluten and of which doctors say that 10 out of 100 people suffer from it and 90% of them do not know it.</p>
<p>Diabetes is a disease in which glucose (sugar) levels in the blood are very high. Glucose comes from the foods you eat. Insulin is a hormone that helps glucose enter cells to supply them with energy. In type 1 diabetes, the body does not make insulin. In type 2 diabetes, the most common, the body does not make or use insulin properly. Without enough insulin, glucose stays in the blood. Over time, too much glucose in the blood can cause serious problems. It can damage the eyes, kidneys, and nerves. Diabetes can also cause heart disease, stroke, and the need to amputate a limb. Pregnant women can also develop diabetes, called gestational diabetes. Diabetes is considered the chronic disease of the 21st century, with the greatest increase in prevalence, since only in the year 2000, 171 million people were reported with this disease and it is estimated that by 2030 there will be 366 million patients, the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.</p>
<p>At OCO we have decided to do our bit and help all these people who need to improve their health and life. Our product supports and streamlines the day-to-day life of these people, in order to lead a normal life without restrictions or limitations. Help us to help, the fact of not reaching our goals in our campaign on Indiegogo, would be a great loss for these people and their lives could be affected, since right now, there is not a great offer of these types of products in the market . We know that you like and enjoy when you eat good bread, delicious cakes, tasty muffins, even sweet crepes. Please help others who cannot eat all this, given their health, that they also can enjoy eating the same like you. We hope that our product is to your liking and that together we can make all these people happy. We cannot do it alone, we need your help. Join us and together we can make millions of people happy.</p>
<h3>Our gools:</h3>
<p>At this moment we have everything ready, we only need enough money to be able to start the production. After finishing our campaign in Indiegogo on May 25, the manufacturing process will begin the following week, on May 31, and we will be able to deliver the product to those who help us within a period of 2 or 3 weeks, from June 1 to June 14. It all depends on you and your help.</p>
<p>We know that it is not an easy path, there is risk, there are challenges, there are ups and downs, but let's assume the risk and together we will win, the union is strength, because without sacrifices there is no victory. Without your help, all our work has been in vain and we have failed in our altruistic desire to help those in need. And failure is not an option, we want to win and we can do it only together.</p>

<p>This is the nutritional value in our products, varying a bit, depending on the ingredients. For those with fruit, the caloric intake is slightly higher but does not exceed 3% of the total calories per 100 g of product. We have to take into account that our products are not finite products, it is a mixture of ingredients that each one in his house will add water and oil, to obtain the final product. The proportion of the mixture and the water is approximately 1: 3 that is 1 part of mix and 3 parts of water. Therefore caloric intake will drop drastically. Then the caloric intake per 100 g of finite product would be about 184 cal.</p>

We know that it is not an easy path, there is risk, there are challenges, there are ups and downs, but let's assume the risk and together we will win, the union is strength, because without sacrifices there is no victory. Without your help, all our work has been in vain and we have failed in our altruistic desire to help those in need. And failure is not an option, we want to win and we can do it only together.

Our Products:
We have a very varied range of products, based on nuts such as almonds and coconut. Our mixes also contain flax seeds, stevia and freeze dried or sun dried fruits.

A healthy product:

This is the nutritional value in our products, varying a bit, depending on the ingredients. For those with fruit, the caloric intake is slightly higher but does not exceed 3% of the total calories per 100 g of product. We have to take into account that our products are not finite products, it is a mixture of ingredients that each one in his house will add water and oil, to obtain the final product. The proportion of the mixture and the water is approximately 1: 3 that is 1 part of mix and 3 parts of water. Therefore caloric intake will drop drastically. Then the caloric intake per 100 g of finite product would be about 184 cal.
 

The health score is a very high 9.9 out of 10, according to the USDA, one of the healthiest products on the market. We are very proud to achieve this. For this we are more than happy to share it with the world.
 

The glycemic index, as you can see is very very low. Also the glycemic load is almost negligible. In order to interpret the glycemic values, we leave some instructions below:

Money allocation:
We will use the money collected in the following way:10% - Product Registration25% - Marketing50% - Purchase of Ingredients and Production15% - Working Capital
We will have total transparency and each of you will be able to ask and find out how we are going to spend each cent. We will be more than happy to do so.
Help us make noise:
If at this time, you can't help us financially, help us make noise and share our campaign with the world, using Indiegogo's sharing tools.
Thank you very much for your time and we hope to see you among our collaborators!",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>What's the story?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>When we created Hopsters Co-Op, we wanted to do something a little bit different. You probably are asking "" why are these guys setting up another brewery?"" and it would be a fair question. We wanted to create a family, a community of like-minded people who want to learn beer, meet new people and share in our success. This is why we created a cooperative, based on 7 founding principles.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Voluntary and Open Membership</strong><br/>Cooperatives are voluntary organizations, open to all persons able to use their services and willing to accept the responsibilities of membership, without gender, social, racial, political or religious discrimination.</p>
<p><strong>Democratic Member Control</strong><br/>Cooperatives are democratic organizations controlled by their members, who actively participate in setting their policies and making decisions. Men and women serving as elected representatives are accountable to the membership. In primary co-operatives members have equal voting rights (one member, one vote) and cooperatives at other levels are also organized in a democratic manner.</p>
<p><strong>Member Economic Participation</strong><br/>Members contribute equitably to, and democratically control, the capital of their cooperative. At least part of that capital is usually the common property of the cooperative. Members usually receive limited compensation, if any, on capital subscribed as a condition of membership. Members allocate surpluses for any or all of the following purposes: developing their cooperative, possibly by setting up reserves, part of which at least would be indivisible; benefiting members in proportion to their transactions with the cooperative, and supporting other activities approved by the membership.</p>
<p><strong>Education, Training and Information</strong><br/>Cooperatives provide education and training for their members, elected representatives, managers, and employees so they can contribute effectively to the development of their cooperatives. They inform the general public – particularly young people and opinion leaders -about the nature and benefits of cooperation.</p>
<p><strong>Autonomy and Independence</strong><br/>Cooperatives are autonomous, self-help organizations controlled by their members. If they enter agreements with other organizations, including governments, or raise capital from external sources, they do so on terms that ensure democratic control by their members and maintain their cooperative autonomy.</p>
<p><strong>Cooperation among Cooperatives</strong><br/>Cooperatives serve their members most effectively and strengthen the cooperative movement by working together through local, national, regional and international structures.</p>
<p><strong>Concern for Community</strong><br/>Cooperatives work for the sustainable development of their communities through policies approved by their members.</p>
<p>Our goal is to reach $100,000.  This will allow us to finish the building of our taproom, allowing our members and the wider beer community somewhere to gather and enjoy everything that is good about beer. We have the followers, we have the beer...we now just need to build our home! All our members and directors have worked tirelessly, and for free as it happens, to ensure we build the foundations of something special. We are so close to the finish line, and we really need your help to launch. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Let's break it down for you folks in a bit more detail.</p>
<p>We'll be honest here, we need $100,000 to make our dreams happen. And they will happen with your awesome support. Don't worry, we have some fantastic perks to keep you interested, ranging from vouchers to spend on our online store/in house to having a stool named after you! You don't even have to select a perk, as there is a button to simply donate. We will be forever grateful regardless of the amount you put in! Every little will help us here, and even if we don't reach our goal, we can still crack on with the necessities. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We have always wanted this to be more than a brewery and bar. Our aim, with the help of our members, is to provide a haven for beer lovers. A place to kick back and grab a beer, learn about brewing and the wider industry. All our members have a say on the beer made, the decisions we make as a democracy and also how we run the taproom. There isn't one big guy looking down dictating, we all have a say! Check out below, as we have made some pretty decent strides over the last couple of years.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are a small Detroit-based, vegan, fast-casual startup restaurant. We will be serving plant-based versions of classic diner food such as burgers, fries, hot dogs and sandwiches.</p>
<p>We are currently seeking an investment of $50,000 which would cover our initial investment costs. These costs include inventory costs, property acquisition and renovations, ServSafe certification and our Health Department costs and other government agencies fees. My brother-in-law who owns his own commercial and residential construction business will be doing the renovations. He and his wife will also help with the day-to-day operations of the restaurant.</p>
<p>My name is Dustin Vanderburg. I am the Co-Owner and Head Chef here at Vegan in the Hood LLC. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration with a Major in Hospitality Management. My expected graduation is August 28, 2020. I currently work as a Shift Supervisor Rx for CVS. I also have experience with management at BabiesRUs and ToysRUs. All 3 positions allowed me to manage in a team setting. I have 15 years of retail experience and about 2 years of warehouse experience. I also have an Associate's degree in General Business and an Associate's degree in Multimedia and two certificates in Small Business Management and Entrepreneurs and Supervision.</p>
<p>My wife, Angela Vanderburg is the other Co-Owner. She has kitchen experience with a local community organization and also has retail experience.</p>
<p>Our current demographic is approximately 2% of Detroiters who are vegan and vegetarian and the unknown percentage of flexitarians and pescatarians here in Detroit. The aforementioned 2% of Detroiters are roughly equivalent to 106,300 people. We hope to reach many of these people with social media and marketing. We are already making a name for the restaurant and have already had calls regarding orders. We are trying to get this project off the ground so we can fulfill future orders that come in.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are currently seeking an investment of $50,000 which would cover our initial investment costs. These costs include inventory costs, property acquisition and renovations, ServSafe certification and our Health Department costs and other government agencies fees.</p>
<p>At the $5 Level, you will get a handwritten thank you note from myself and my wife, collectively the co-owners. This will ship out on or around May 2020.</p>
<p>At the $25 Level, you will get a dish with your name on it. This is a limited prize due to our limited menu of course.</p>
<p>At the $100 Level, you will get an invitation to the Soft opening private food tasting. This prize is limited due to the cost and available space. If we can raise much more than the goal we can offer more of this prize level depending on the number of contributions.</p>
<p>At the $2500 Level, we are offering a Chef's Table after-hours private tasting of my favorite dishes in a 3-course meal setting.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If we can reach our goal this will offer a healthy comfort food option to the food desert that is Downtown Detroit. Our mission is to bring a healthy alternative to the fast-food garbage that is served locally. We want to offer comfort food that we and the people around here locally grew up with but in a vegan format. This will also give vegans in the area some of the options they are missing or crave. Detroit is a hotbed for vegan food and we want to offer an alternative to the million and one non-vegan diners and Coney Islands around this area.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our biggest challenge is the timeline for the Health Department certification and inspection. Once we tackle that hurdle it is mostly smooth sailing for the most part up until opening. Getting the building we want for a good price and getting the renovation done quickly and cost-effectively is the other major challenge facing us. The Health Department is a necessary evil that we must face and there is not much we can do to remedy that, however, getting funding for this project will help get the building and get the process started. Another major hurdle is advertising. We have already started to make a name for ourselves and have orders coming in even before we are open. This is great but to maintain customers we need a building and to advertise. We have already started on this process thanks to social media. We plan to increase this by reaching out to local news stations and radio personalities once we get closer to open to spread the word even further. We hope to catch the eye of the public like some of our competition. Of course, we also plan to utilize traditional advertising methods as well to increase public awareness of our location. We have selected a high traffic area in which to operate as well.</p>

<h3>In the Beginning...</h3>
<p>Our story starts with two friends having beer in a garage in August 2014. It's rumored that the beer may have influenced the discussion, but at some point, Kevin remarked that he always dreamed of owning his own brewery. In less than a year a crazy idea turned into a fully functioning brewery in Fort Saskatchewan, with beer on the market all across Alberta! </p>
<h3>Onward! To Glory!</h3>
<p>In 2017 we made the bold decision to pack up and move our operations from Fort Saskatchewan to Edmonton. It has been a long road, with more than a few bumps, but we are finally at the end.</p>
<h3>How can you Help?</h3>
<p>Many of our loyal fans have asked us how they can help get the new location open. This campaign is a fantastic way for those who are unable to make conventional investments contribute. We are trying to raise $50,000 to fund our final push to opening. This money will be used for all the finishing touches and last minute expenses that always crop up. It will also allow us to replenish our operating capital fund, which has been completely depleted due to the construction delays. In return you get some fantastic perks.</p>

<p>My name is Jasmine Hernandez. I am a young Orange County native and my passion is bringing the world delicious vegan dishes that have surrounded me as a Chicana in California. When I found Veganism I found my fire and now I want to share it with the world! I created Chicana Vegana to show people that healthier and happier lives are possible through delicious plant based foods! Underserved communities finally need food options that are both delicious and healthy and this is our chance! Any single donation is a stand for your family and our community and together we can make this vegan restaurant a reality! Are you ready !? Because we are!</p>
<p>Our main goal to fund is our kitchen buildout ! Even though our dream location is perfect there is no existing kitchen so we need to build out our very own! With out a kitchen there is no restaurant and thats where you come in ! If we reach our goal we can open sooner and without delay! This also shows that if we have this support our restaurant will too have lasting support once its open ! An average cost to build a commercial kitchen is around 10k to 20k and as close as we can get to any of those numbers will make us so happy !</p>
<p>Everyones contribution is a voice for change! Lets build a plant-based community and start with Chicana Vegana.</p>
<p>If we do not reach our goals our dreams of opening shop may still be possible but with much much delay. Again if we make our goal it helps us build our kitchen and gives us peace of mind knowing we have a community that supports us! Thank you so much familia!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Annie Montgomery, I was born and raised in New Orleans, LA., I come from a family of nine, both my parents have passed on, and just last year, June of 2018 we lost my oldest sister.   To show my appreciation and gratitude to my mom, I want to give her the credit for showing me how to cook like her.  Because of my mom, I have perfected her style and taste of New Orleans style seafood gumbo that makes me extremely happy and proud to share her taste of gumbo with California and the world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>About the owner:</strong></p>
<p>I met my husband when I was just seven years old, never in a million years did I think that he   and I would end up together as husband and wife.  We have been married now for thirty nine years and counting.  We have three children, one girl and two boys.  We are blessed with five grand kids, one grand daughter and four grandsons.  We moved our family here to northern California, back in March of 1986  we have moved three times in the whole thirty three years we have been here.  I have been gainfully employed with the same company for the last 26 years and counting, and now it's time for me to start thinking about the years ahead.  </p>
<p>I'm dying to bring this unique flavor and taste to California and the world, that's why I have created this indiegogo campaign to get some financial support to help make my dream of making my mom proud of me.</p>

</ul>
<p>With your support, and the support of many more people, you will give me the opportunity to share this unique taste and flavor with the world.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If you have never been to New Orleans, but always heard about the food and fun, the food is one of the best unique tastes you will experience.  Being from New Orleans, and living here in California, all of the years we have been living here, I have not come across an establishment that truly represents ""New Orleans"" flavor the way I do.  With your help, ""Annie's Bowl of Gumbo can be readily available to the world with just the click of a button. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Annie's Bowl of Gumbo is a combination of seasonings and flavor of creole style cooking that incorporates some seasoning ingredients some people may or may not be able to consume.  This is why I have created this campaign, to use it as a test market platform that will give me the feedback I need to continue pursuing my goal of making my mom's recipe available to the world.  Food is an acquired taste no matter what it is, and the taste may or may not agree with everyone.  Based on the number of people who enjoy and can consume the dish will help determine  the risk factor for Annie's Bowl of Gumbo.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>
<p>For those of you who would love to contribute,  please help make some noise about my campaign, by telling family and friends about my indiegogo crowd funding.  </p>

<h3>Why I'm starting Inked Babes Relax Coffee...</h3>
<p>I finally figured out what I want to be when I grow up, and what I want to do for the rest of my life.  Over the last year and a half, I have created <strong><i>Inked Babes Relax Coffee Co.</i></strong> - a THC/CBD themed coffee shop ran by happy, outgoing tattooed women.</p>
<p>I want to create an environment where people can enjoy a great cup of coffee, relax and be surrounded by happiness.  I know that there are people out there struggling, and I want to offer a place where we can be there for one another, drop all of the craziness in the world and enjoy a cup of coffee together.</p>
<p>Making tattoos a theme of my coffee shop embraces the individuality of each person that visits.  Tattoos for me have been a release from the pain I've experienced in life, and now i have beautiful art on my body because of it.  This is part of who I am, so I made it part of my brand.</p>
<p>Infusing herbal remedies, including CBD and THC, in our blends adds a unique twist because I want <i><strong>Inked Babes Relax Coffee Co.</strong></i> to symbolize healing and be a place where people heal.</p>
<p>Your support and contributions will help me grow the <i><strong>Inked Babes Relax Coffee</strong></i> brand and open my coffe shop dream come true.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Perks for your support!</h3>
<p>My initial goal of $20,000 will allow me to lease the property, purchase the equipment and obtain the licenses necessary to open my <i><strong>Inked Babes Relax Coffee</strong></i> Shop.  Hopefully we can surpass that goal to reach at least $60,000 that will cover upgrades and operating expenses while we get the business moving.</p>
<p>To generate the funds, I am offering Inked Babes gear, coffee cups and even kcups of our original blend... along with other fun perks like a calendar featuring our beautiful Inked Babes and VIP tickets to our launch party when we open shop.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Thanks for making a difference!</h3>
<p>Your contribution will help me create this incredible place where people can go to enjoy the best coffee with the best people. I know you will love the Inked Babes brand, and I hope you will visit whenever you get the chance!</p>

There is nothing healthier than eating fresh fruit. In any case, adding a glass of fresh fruit juice to your diet is equally the same . If you do not consume fruits every day, the best alternative is to make fresh juice a part of your diet.  Beveradise is an energy drinks startup business, and currently we have just finished branding, and designing and are ready to go into the manufacturing stage. We are producing low sugar energy drinks made from fruit juice and coconut water designed to provide a healthier body, mental clarity, and stamina. Having a glass of our fresh juice every morning helps in detoxifying your body as our juice is made from 50% coconut water to add natural low sugar.While most energy drinks are made with the cheapest ingredients to maximize profits and rarely focus on the consumer's true overall health, we use only the best most natural ingredients and have formulated our product to reduce most overlooked health dangers such as caffeine, calories, sugars, and sodium. We have experienced the firsthand problems that can arise from the consumption of most of today's energy drinks on the market. It is our goal to effect a change for the future and provide product that works and benefit each individuals, both short and long term.  Beveradise will help to strengthen your immune system, aid digestion, and prevents allergies and ailments from entering your system. Fruit juices detoxify your body and naturally flush out the toxins from your body which results in weight loss. Our energy drink Juice has the advantage of providing water to your body, keeping it hydrated. Every juice comes with a certain health benefit and adds value to your system. If you are feeling hydrated, you can have a glass of our juice. If you are feeling exhausted after a long day at work, you can have a glass of our papaya or strawberry  juice as it restores the energy levels of your body.  Your body easily digests liquid and instantly provides nutritional value. We have found through countless research the increasing numbers in those that are unable to enjoy an energy drink product because it does not meet all the desires and health issues of the consumer, including cost. The availability of our product will open many consumption avenues for individuals that currently do not exist.  50% of Coconut water adds natural low sugars. The coconut water adds these benefits.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>It seems that nothing gets people more passionate than their diets.  I get that and I'm here for that reason:</p>
<ul>

It seems that nothing gets people more passionate than their diets.  I get that and I'm here for that reason:

I started my Ketogenic journey December 8th 2017.  Five months later I was 135 pounds lighter.  
Two months into my Keto journey my mother took the plunge.  She had a really hard time getting the electrolytes she needed and had a history of hypothyroid as many do.  I needed a solution that would help with both that she would enjoy and comply with.
My cookie was the first thing that got her over the hump and on the road to recovery.  There are thousands of Keto dieters who struggle for electrolytes, portable foods, quick foods, and who are likely lacking thyroid support.  How about making the solution delicious, natural, and Keto?
By far the three biggest complaints I hear about Keto are lack of electrolytes, lack of easy and available portable foods, and a satisfying dessert that won't take 2 hours to make.

 

What We Need & What You Get
Lets make Keto possible, easier, and enjoyable for everyone:

I have dozens of recipes that I want to make eventually but lets start easy and make a chocolate chip cookie that's actually great for you.  NO SUGAR NO GRAINS!
How about a cookie with high quality fats, at least 250 mg sodium, 250 mg of potassium, 67 mg of magnesium, 57 mcg Selenium, and B Vitamins with just all natural foods!  2 G net carbs, more than 80% calories from healthy fats. Omega 3s.  NO SUGAR NO GRAINS!
I've found a place that will make these, but I'm just a normal guy with normal bills and normal money on hand.  I can't make these without your help to hit the minimum run required.


The Impact
This is just the beginning with your help :

Go through the grocery store and try to find something to take out that doesn't have SUGAR or GRAINS.
We are on the precipice of a food revolution.  The standard American diet is wrong and needs to be fixed.  The reality is that many of the people  that will turn to a Ketogenic diet will fail simply because it's too hard and there are not options for them to save the time they don't have.
I've spent thousands of dollars and dozens of recipes to find a group of quick, easy, portable foods that are Keto and great for you in many ways.


Risks & Challenges

A revolution is on the way and I just want to help people make the changes to reach their goals. With your help we can remove the impediments that stop them.

This made, with his father, inquiring about progress in the area of raising fermented beverages and distilled spirits. Due to this investigation, they verified that, if the contact surface of the wood with the liquid gets increased, the contribution of aromas, flavors and colors, get accelerated considerably and pleasantly. The size was important because, so it had to be easy to handle and maintain, reusable, keep cool the drink, fit in the refrigerator or dig and also it must be able to served directly to the table.Then, around 2014, they began to create Roblella, an exclusive and premium oak bottle.The name of our oak bottle is the contraction of the spanish word Oak (Roble) and bottle (Botella). Roblella contraction defines perfectly this innovative bottle that allows you to feel the aromas and the flavours of the oak (and more thanks to the infuser) in your drinks.We collaborate with professionals with national recognition, such as Prof. María Encarna Gómez Plaza, professor at the department of food technology and nutrition at the Murcia University and also, wine specialist. We work continually in search of improving our product.Indiegogo has a huge community of 'early adopters' who can help us to keep moving on our project and improving it.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>My name is Peter Kuhn and I am a successful Australian Entrepreneur now living in Kiev, Ukraine. I am 61 years young and still have the energy and desire to create a new business in a foreign country. I have been living in Ukraine for 4 years and I find Kiev a wonderful and exciting city to live in.</li>
<li>Following 3 years of selling our tasty Australian Pies in the Kiev market to small outlets being cafes, pubs and clubs, we now have the opportunity to enter the major retail chain markets of supermarkets, petrol stations and large chain cafes. The goal of this campaign is to provide us with sufficient funds to facilitate a substantial marketing program, employ a professional sales and marketing team, and also to support a delayed cash flow due to the trading terms of these major retail chains. Also during this expansion period we will be purchasing new equipment for the factory to assist in reducing production costs.  </li>
<li>When we achieve our target contributions we will be able to expand the business to a level of sales of approximately $1,200,000 US per annum (30,000,000 UAH local currency) which will generate EBITDA profits of approximately $300,000 US per annum (7,500,000 UAH).</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We are seeking funding of <strong>$60,000</strong> US which equals 20% of the nominated holding company and this will be invested in the following areas of the business. <ol>
<li>New equipment - Filling Depositor <strong>$2,000</strong> - Shock Freezer <strong>$4,000</strong>
</li>
<li>In store marketing campaigns that will include tastings of the products. We will produce ""mini pies"" of 40 grams for this purpose. This will occur in all selected supermarket outlets and will continue for a period of 3 hours per day for the 3 busiest trading days and times in each supermarket. We are anticipating a total of 30 supermarkets and each promotion will cost approximately $70 US giving a total budget of $6,300 US. Allowing for possible over time of the staff involved we suggest a total of $7,000 for these activities. Once the first run of these promotions have been completed we intend to do a second run 1 month later. Total budget for this will now be <strong>$14,000 US</strong>
</li>
<li>Printed marketing material will be required for all new outlets. These will be ""Table Tent Menus"" in cafes,pubs, petrol stations etc, external metal stand up signs, and also ""descriptive flyers"" to be positioned in the supermarkets. <strong>$5,000 US  </strong> </li>
<li>Employment of Marketing Director to be covered for the first 6 months of this period of growth. <strong>$12,000 US</strong>
</li>
<li>Employment of professional sales team for the first 3 months of the growth period. <strong>$6000</strong> US. Note that these salaries will be linked to sales performance once the sales begin to grow.</li>
<li>A major balance of the funds will be required to cover the cash flow delay created by dealing with major retail chains. The standard trading terms of these retailers is 45 days for payment following the delivery. 45 days of production costs to service the anticipated sales of 800 products per day will be approximately <strong>$15,000</strong> US</li>
<li>The total of all the above is <strong>$58,000</strong> US and the balance of <strong>$2,000</strong> will be kept in reserve for further marketing programs and ongoing minor expansion costs. </li>
<li>The final goal for the business in Ukraine is to achieve sales of 5000 products per day. All the above costs are attributable to expansion in Kiev only and as the supermarkets begin distribution to outlets in other major cities we will need to continue with the promotional activities in each new location.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Perks can be many different varieties dependent upon the level of contribution and also the location of the contributor. Below we lay out the possibilities.<ul style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<li>Contributors living in Kiev providing funds of $100+ US will have 10 of our delicious products delivered to their home.</li>
<li>Contributors living in Kiev providing funds of $1,000+ US will also receive the 10 products delivered to their door and will also receive a $50 US voucher that can be used at one of Kiev's great French Restaurants, Garchitsa!</li>
<li>For contributors living outside of Ukraine we will arrange the same values of the previous ""perks"" to be used at your preferred food outlet. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Should we not achieve our desired funding within the period, all funds we do receive will be returned to the contributors minus any costs taken by the site provider, Indiegogo.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>The final value to each contributor will be of course a financial one, but we want to point out that this project is employing some of the good people of Ukraine during a time of tough economic conditions for them. When we reach our goal of 5000 products per day we will be employing approximately 20 local people. Our staff are all Ukrainian and are very wonderful and dedicated people to the concept and dream of bringing the iconic Australian Meat Pie to their fellow Ukrainian citizens. </li>
<li>I was successful in Australia with other projects not linked to this type of project, but my dedication to this project included me spending 4 weeks working in a bakery in Australia, seeking consultants from the industry to provide professional advice on recipes and production processes, all to understand what was required to produce a fantastic product that is acceptable to this market. </li>
<li>As I have always been interested in food this dream of taking Australian Meat Pies to Ukraine was born out of research carried out over a two year period prior to my relocating from Australia to Ukraine. Recognition of our product came from the largest supermarket chain in Ukraine which want our product placed in their ""Bench of Tradition"" section. We have brought the ""Traditional Australian Food"" to Ukraine for their enjoyment, and to date we have no complaints from people that have eaten this food!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The risks and challenges to this project were partly determined when we commenced the business over three years ago. We appointed a local advertising agency to assist us with market research and advice on the purchasing culture of the Ukrainian people. The big risk was of course the local population not accepting the product! In the very early days the agency carried out ""Focus Group""test sessions of three different socioeconomic sections of the community. They were ""University Students"", ""Young Professionals"",and finally ""Families"". All the groups provided positive feed back on the taste, price and presentation of the product. Results of this research are available.       </p>
<ul>
<li>During the first periods of production and sales we began to understand better what the purchasing culture is in this country. Of course the revolution in 2014 and then the devaluation of the local currency caused problems with the affordability of what was considered a gourmet product due to the amount of meat product in each pie.</li>
<li>Our plans for overcoming these challenges were quite simple. We began to produce pies that contained products better known to the local market, such as ""Potato and Mushroom Pie"", ""Cabbage and Mushroom Pie"",""Cherry Pie"", and many other products more suitable to a broader market. We now have 25 recipes of Pies and Sausage Rolls, as well as other Iconic Australian bakery products and also we now produce Ukrainian pastry products that will be sold to the petrol station groups and chain cafes.  </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>In closing, we trust that all people that are interested, or even just intrigued with the Australian man bringing this product to Ukraine, either contribute to the project or at the very least let your friends know all about us.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and interest.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>

Suppose that there is a massive famine in East Africa, which strongly hit Addis Abeba, a huge city of 5 million people. LGHF may identify a poor neighbourhood of the suburbs of Addis Abeba, populated by 100 thousands people; it will have to make the computation and then ask donations for feeding this specific suburb with cricket protein for a certain period, like “Feed Suburb X of Addis Abeba, heavily hit by famine, for 3 months with cricket proteins”. This campaign could be a large charity crowdfunding that may be sustained by large companies, hence it can ask for millions.

And do you know that this malnutrition is mainly caused by diets poor in protein consumption? (Source: FAO) We want to make our contribution in this struggle by massively producing cricket powder, a superfood that contains 60% of protein and several other crucial nourishments.  What are the benefit for their health, if malnutrished people start consuming insect proteins. We already mentioned that 3.6 million kids die for malnutrition every year only in Africa and more than 30 million people worldwide. Having state that, we are admitting that there exist a market for protein that does not fulfill its purpose: allocating efficiently its resources. The reason of this failure is simple: animal proteins have a huge cost for extremely poor people. By studying the production of cricket powder, a flour made by grinding dry crickets, we realized that we could offer the product for 4 €/kg in Third World Countries.

High quality amminoacides: relatively to proteins it is also important to consider the quality of amminoacides: insects contain high quality amminoacides, fundamentals for the muscolar growth. These nourishments are not contained in vegetable proteins, such as beans or soy.
  What are the benefit for the environment if more and more people start converting their animal protein consumption towards insects.  The agribusiness is the second world polluter. Meat and fish markets are responsible for 24% of global emissions. This is mainly due to the fact that cows’ farts contain methan, which pollutes 25 times more than CO2. Since we raised cows population to billions, it became an issue. Agribusinesses pollutes also indirectly: 70% of agricultural land is used to produce vegetable proteins to feed animals. Since humans are globally increasing agricultural lands, partly by cutting down rainforests, reducing their lung breathing effect, we are deforesting to feed animals that will keep polluting. As everyone knows, if humans does not invert the pollution trend, consequences may be catastrophic. Insects may contribute to change things. Since 2003, the Food and Agricultural Organization, a UN agency, talks about environmental benefits in producing insects for human consumption. Insects are source of food incredibly more sustainable than traditional animal sources, crickets emit thousands times less Green House Gasses , they need 6 times less food to convert in edible product and they consume 4 times less water than cattles.As world population grows, we will need to produce more and more proteins, but we clearly cannot afford to keep using polluting sources such as cattle, pork and fish. If insects start integrating human diet in an increasing proportion, we may be able to decrease the damage we are inflicting to our own Planet to feed our vast population. What are our products?Our project purpose is to raise large cricket’s farms. These facilities can sell cricket powder, as already mentioned, dry crickets, alive crickets, mainly to be fed to reptiles, cricket poo, which is a sustainable and high-quality fertilizer, methan produced by the fermentation of cricket poo and all the derivative products that can obtained (pasta, bread, crackers, protein bars, snacks,...).  What can be cooked with cricket powder?Cricket powder should be considered equivalent to wheat flour, in an organic sense, and to meat and fish in the capacity of feeding a human being.It can be transformed in bread, pasta, cakes, milk shakes, juices and several other things.As an Italian company we believe that a natural outlet of cricket powder will be pasta. Cricket’s pasta is a perfect way to have a healthy meal if your economic resources are scarce and your struggling to buy meat and fish for your family: if you eat pasta with a vegetable sauce, such as tomato sauce, you are consuming high-quality proteins, vegetables, a fair quantity of carbohydrates, several important vitamins and acid fats. In our website there will be a dedicated section about recipes. We will hire a chef to shoot videos that will show how to cook cricket’s powder, that will be uploaded also on our Youtube channel. Who will be our customers?In developed countries we will have two main kind of target consumers for the cricket powder:People that care about sustainability of food: this people will consume our product because they believe in the cause of reducing the pollution emitted by our meals by choosing wisely what we eat. We will be able to reach this cluster selling to bio-shops, bio-supermarket, pharmacies and herbalists. In addition we will try to sell directly to retail customers through our website and our social media activities.People involved in fitness: if you care about your body and you want to consume less carbohydrates and more high-quality proteins, you should start considering eating cricket’s powder based meals. We will be able to reach this cluster selling to fitness shops, supermarkets, energy snack producers, food integrators producers, and gyms. In addition we will try to sell directly to retail customers through our website and our social media activities.On the contrary, in the Third world we will need to sell to entities that feed people that are in a poverty state: human organizations, schools, churches, soup kitchens, local governments or orphanages.Another type of customer, that will be extremely important in the beginning of operations, will be reptile breeders. Reptiles, as some fishes and frogs, require to eat alive crickets. We will be able to deliver alive crickets in Italy and some other close countries, such as Switzerland, France, Austria, Germany and Slovenia. Currently, people can buy alive crickets from their local pet shop or by online shops, in both cases the majority of those crickets will come from Eastern European farms. Hence, the animals are suffering at least 24 hours long travels before getting to the reptile breeder, resulting in high mortality rates. Our purpose is to supply Italian pet shops with periodical deliveries of italian alive crickets for a competitive price. Touching the market with first hand we realized that is very easy to convince pet shop to change their supplier if they  know that your facility is close, because the advantage in travel times, hence in mortality rates, is clear.Whole dry crickets will be an option in buying cricket powder and they are basically the ungrinded version of cricket powder. This product will be sold to exotic restaurants mainly, so they can actually show the cricket in their dishes, like in fried crickets.Hydrogen, Methan and zero km fertilizer: crickets will produce tons of waste product, which is composed by poo and exosckeletons mainly. We will wet this product and we will ferment it to obtain methan bubbles, that will be gathered in methan clynders. The resulting fermentated waste will be then dried to obtain a high quality agricultural fertilizer. Then methan (CH4) will be chemically processed to isolate hydrogen from carbon.  What are our short-term targets? This idea of business is very young in age, the study has began in August 2020 and it has been proposed to only two investors of capital, that immediately agreed on funding. Other two operating but still funding partners will join the business from January, taking care of biology, chemistry, humanitarian contacts, recruiting, legal and sales. Cash will flow to Los Grillos Hermanos from December 2020 and operations will officially begin in January 2021. To start operation in January and fund properly a digital marketing agency contract we agreed on asking to the community of Indiegogo 8000€.Our original will was to start operations in Siena, so that we could also link our production to very ancient and famous local products of our hometown. We have tried for weeks to find a warehouse nearby Siena, but no opportunity was offered by local real estate market.The closest appropriate facility we could find was in Certaldo (Firenze), a perfect spot to grow crickets, even if it is someway far from distribution centers.Then we received concerns about the legal italian situation for commerce, so we decided to change everything and start producing in UK, in Birmingham, which is the second british city by population, and it is widely more affordable then London. Right now we are taking into consideration the offer of one of our investor partner to produce in one of his warehouse in Milano. We are deepening legal situation to take the right choice... Assuming that we would be able to start operation in January in Milano, our short term targets will be: 
Open losgrilloshermanos.com by January 2021;
Build a greenhouse inside a warehouse to breed cricekets by February 2021;
Breed crickets, hence harvesting first batches of crickets from April 2021;
Create a Youtube channel with our initiatives, like the live stream of our live zoo, the recipes of the Chef, our video material, ... by January 2021;
Begin the partnership with a digital marketing agency from January 2021;
Start selling pasta and other derivatives of the cricket powder from June 2021;
Create a network of commercial agents with a coworking office in the warehouse from February 2021;
Start producing methan and hydrogen from June 2021;
Open Los Grillos Hermanos Foundation from January 2021;
...
 Our short-term goals will be:
Sell to 50 pet shops in Italy a 1000 alive crickets box every two weeks. This mean we will be selling for 2000€ every month.
Sell 100 kg of cricket powder every month at an average price of 10€/kg, which will generate selling for 1000 €.
 What is Los Grillos Hermanos Foundation? Another feature of our website will be the donation section, where people will be able to do charity: we will select 5 charitable projects around the globe to whom donate supplies of cricket powder. We will create an independent no-profit organization named Los Grillos Hermanos Foundation that will raise money for feeding people in some Third World Country facilities with cricket’s powder. This entity will operate separately from the Italian firm, but will buy from it the powder at a convenient and locked price. Donators will be found by using proper social media campaigns. Los Grillos Hermanos Foundation will try to raise specific crowdfunding campaigns such as in the following example. Suppose that there is a massive famine in East Africa, which strongly hit Addis Abeba, a huge city of 5 million people. LGHF may identify a poor neighbourhood of the suburbs of Addis Abeba, populated by 100 thousands people; it will have to make the computation and then ask donations for feeding this specific suburb with cricket protein for a certain period, like “Feed Suburb X of Addis Abeba, heavily hit by famine, for 3 months with cricket proteins”. This campaign could be a large charity crowdfunding that may be sustained by large companies, hence it can ask for millions. Specifically, this campaign would need to raise money to buy 900 tons of cricket powder, so it will have to raise 2-3 millions of euros. How we will reward your donation Your donation will be rewarded with our merchandise, with a periodical supply of alive crickets or with cricket powder.In case you choose to get rewarded with cricket powder we give you the chance to donate the product to our no-profit organization to be shipped to Third world needing facilities. By doing this, you will donate twice, once to a young social responsible business and once to needing people.Otherwise, you can donate a simbolic amount to be rewarded with our colourfull merchandising:
Shirts: here you can see unisex models but we can deliver you also the shirt for girls. Colours are yellow, white+yellow, white+red, red, light blue.
Hat: available only yellow for the moment:Apron: available only in yellow for the moment:Facemask: available in yellow and in white:  How would we use extra-donations:
We can fund a research project on artificial selection of crickets, in order to raise a healthier, bigger and fast-growing animal.
We may fund a nutritional and economic research on the impact of large use of insect protein in poor populations.
We will be able to fund an automation research in which we will try to build a system of breeding containers that gets their food and water supply from a machine that moves on a binary.
We will donate part of the sum to the no-profit organization, in order to fund a contract with a digital marketing agency.
We will fund the purchase of an industrial machine and all the relative equipment for pasta production, in order to experiment some format and maybe start selling.
 What can you do to support usYou can donate, but you can also do something even more important: you can share the cause of converting part of your protein consumption into insects, for the environment. Share this information to your contacts and we will be already glad for your help, news and description are on our social media pages. QUOTES: ""the idea of using a raw edible material by exploiting at best its properties""""3.6 million kids die for malnutrition every year""""reducing the pollution emitted by our meals by choosing wisely what we eat""""share the cause of converting part of your protein consumption into insects""""Our mission is to feed human beings that are in a state of poverty with cricket powder""",32.0,2,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","Short Summary We have been experimenting with vegan cheese for quite a while now and think we can do better than the commercial, artificially flavoured vegan products on the market. We're a young couple and have both worked as chefs in veg & vegan restaurants. 
Our cheeses have an aged flavour from natural probiotics and utelise almonds, macademias, hemp seeds, organic non-gmo soy, coconut fats and other natural ingredients.


   What We Need & What You Get Funding will go towards:


£500 - professional blender to get a creamy smooth texture from our cheeses
£200 - first stock order from wholesaler
£100 - packaging and branding
£200 - improvements to our kitchen space, small equipment & storage

Perks:


our cheeses, of course! (see side bar) These will be sent after our funding comes through and our full range is launched (we currently have a very limited preorder range). You will receive an email when this happens and can then select your cheese(s).


    

The Impact Why we need a vegan cheese company:  very little decent vegan cheese available in the UK more ethical than dairy cheese the less people are 'missing out on', the more likely they are to go vegan

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Our Promoter, Mr Oladapo Loto, graduated with First Class honours in Biochemistry from The Federal University of Technology, Akure in 1987. He joined Nigerian Breweries Plc (The Heineken Subsidiary in Nigeria) in August 1988 where he trained as a Brewer. Subsequently he worked for Consolidated Breweries Plc and Guinness Nigeria Plc. He held many roles in the Brewing Industry some of which includes Shift Brewer, Brewing Manager, Development Brewer and Head Brewer. He has developed training manuals for Brewing training in the past, involved in Research and Development as well as Operations management. In the past five years he has been consulting especially in the area of ethanol fermentation and is currently setting up a 33,000 litres per day ethanol distillery for a Client in Ikorodu, Lagos, Nigeria</p>
<p>The Brewing is a sector of the Nigerian economy can create hundreds and thousands of jobs more than what currently exists if only people understand how to go about it. To achieve this we need to get many people involved in Craft brewing if it must make any meaningful impact in Nigeria, hence the idea of the Brewing School.<br/>With over 20 million people and a sizeable expatriate population and no craft beer, a lot of potential exist for Craft Brewing right here in Lagos. We want to create a new industry segment.</p>
<p>This project intends to bring the Industry closer to the people in a way they can understand it and partake in it thereby deepening the economy and creating the much needed jobs for many of our youths and unemployed graduates. Anybody from any background can get involved in the craft brewing industry with the right training and exposure. This is what we hope to create right here in Lagos, Nigeria with this project.</p>
<p>If you help us to achieve this project, you will be helping to kick start a new area for economic development for Nigeria. The impact of this in the overall economy will be felt through the creation of many jobs. The Project itself will employ 15 to 20 people directly in the first 12 months and provide part time employment for resource persons that will be involved in our training ( Brewing, Quality, Marketing, Sales, Engineering, Catering Consultants etc). This will also ensure that a lot of our retired and working professionals will always have something to do. Our Trainees will be encouraged to seek certifications from recognized professional institutes after the training and we would assist them in this regard.</p>
<p><strong>The Brewing School or Institute will train students in both theoretical and practical brewing and actually brew and package their own beer in the Pilot Brewery during the course of their training.</strong> We believe the Brewing Academy should be housed in a running Microbrewery to enable the trainees to appreciate what they are learning. It will further provide opportunities for internship for interested trainees after the training period.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The Brewing School will be be housed in an existing 200m<sup>2 </sup>Apartment in a Serene Estate in the Ojodu area of Lagos, Nigeria. The Microbrewery will be housed in another 100m2 apartment in the same location all owned by the Promoter. An additional 150m<sup>2</sup> area exist in the premises that will be further developed for the Brewing School and Microbrewery.</p>
<p>Our target is to raise $95,000 dollars to be utilised as follows;</p>
<ol>
<li>Payment of Crowdfunding fees</li>
<li>Acquisition of a Microbrewery complete with the following;</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>A 50 litres Pilot brewery dedicated exclusively to Brewing Training with all its Ancillary machines.</li>
<li>200 litres per batch brewhouse capable of processing a high percentage of local raw materials</li>
<li>8000 litres of monthly fermentation capacity</li>
<li>Bright beer filter</li>
<li>1600 litres of Bright beer tank</li>
<li>Keg washing and filling machine</li>
<li>Manual bottling Machine</li>
<li>Kegs, Kegerators and growlers</li>
<li>Steam boiler, Glycol Chilling Plant, Air Compressor, Control systems, Cleaning systems and other ancillary machines</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li value=""3""> Other Training Materials and aids, books etc.</li>
<li value=""4"">Modification of the existing apartments for the Training School and Brewery</li>
</ol>
<p>It is highly possible that we might not raise anything at all or fall far short of our target. But whatever we are able to achieve here we intends to actualize our goal of setting up the Brewing School and Microbrewery before the end of 2018. It may mean we have to scale down substantially on the Microbrewery part initially. But we don't intend to scale back on the training.</p>
<p> We have a lots of perks for our backers. This perks includes personalised thank you letters from us, Invitation to the Brewery promotional events and discount on the purchases of our products.</p>
<p>Other backers will be invited to the Brewery for free tours. Others will be invited for brew days where they can experience brewing for a day. Others can join us for two days of brewing experience whereas, for others we can offer them eight days brewing training free of charge. This eight days does not necessarily have to happen at a stretch. it can be spread over a nine month period. For some of our big backers, we will give gift vouchers for substantial quantities of beer . For others, they will remain part of us for a long time because we will name some of our key equipments like fermentation and bright beer tanks after them and we would also name some of our key departments like Brewhouse, Fermentation room, Packaging room and Brewing School after our biggest backers.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The Nigerian economy is one that is in dire need of diversification and developing the Microbrewery sector is a way of doing so. It will help to achieve the following;</p>
<ul>
<li>Create new businesses for entrepreneurs and business owners</li>
<li>Create jobs for our ever increasing youth population in Nigeria</li>
<li>Create part time jobs for retired corporate executives that we will tap to provide additional resources for our training programmes. </li>
<li>Create additional sources of revenue for government in terms of excise duties, taxes, corporate and personal income taxes.</li>
<li>Provide new markets for our farmers (grains etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>You contributions will be helping to solve part of the social problems in Nigeria.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Like all human endeavours, there are risks and challenges associated with every new venture. some that we have identified are as follows;</p>
<ol>
<li>Getting the relevant regulatory approvals <strong>(Customs, NAFDAC, SON etc)</strong> to set up the Microbrewery and the approval of the <strong>National Board for Technical Education </strong>(if we found it necessary) as it relates to the Brewing School since this is a vocational training school.</li>
<li>Creating awareness about the existence of the Brewing School</li>
<li>Building trust in people that we can actually deliver on our promise</li>
<li>Building a market for Craft Beer.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since we are not planning to set up a theoretical training school, setting up the Microbrewery is central for us to be able to actualize this project. In terms of getting the relevant regulatory approval, we are aware that a Microbrewery has started operating in Abuja and that is a good precedent that will help to quicken the issuance of our own excise licence to us by the Nigeria Customs services. <strong>However, we cannot apply for the licence until we are sure of the extent of funding we can raise. </strong>Once we get the excise license from Customs, it becomes easy to get the import permit from the Standard Organisation of Nigeria (SON) to import the Microbrewery equipment. Once the equipment are installed, the National Agency for Foods and Drugs Administration and Control (NAFDAC) will be invited to inspect and certify the Microbrewery.  </p>
<p>Oladapo Loto is a seasoned Brewer with long years of experience in the Industry whose experience includes relating with Regulatory authorities. He knows what to do to overcome issues relating to Government regulations.</p>
<p>We intends to start a massive social media campaign to create awareness for the Brewing School and the Microbrewery. Since the Microbrewery will be functioning, we will hold promotional events across Lagos especially in high profile bars, event centres and top Hotels. During the promotional events, we will also promote the Brewing School. </p>
<p>Our Trainees and visitors will help us to create goodwill for the project once they can experience the facilities we have in place and the quality of our instructions.</p>
<p>As stated previously, the success of the commercial side of the project (marketing of craft beer from the Microbrewery) will help to build awareness for craft beer and help to start building the market for craft beer.</p>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>

<p>Even if you are unable to back us financially, you can help us by spreading the word to your friends and network. Be sure to use the Indiegogo share tool.</p>

But whatever we are able to achieve here we intends to actualize our goal of setting up the Brewing School and Microbrewery before the end of 2018. It may mean we have to scale down substantially on the Microbrewery part initially. But we don't intend to scale back on the training.
 We have a lots of perks for our backers. This perks includes personalised thank you letters from us, Invitation to the Brewery promotional events and discount on the purchases of our products.
Other backers will be invited to the Brewery for free tours. Others will be invited for brew days where they can experience brewing for a day. Others can join us for two days of brewing experience whereas, for others we can offer them eight days brewing training free of charge. This eight days does not necessarily have to happen at a stretch. it can be spread over a nine month period. For some of our big backers, we will give gift vouchers for substantial quantities of beer . For others, they will remain part of us for a long time because we will name some of our key equipments like fermentation and bright beer tanks after them and we would also name some of our key departments like Brewhouse, Fermentation room, Packaging room and Brewing School after our biggest backers.

The Impact
The Nigerian economy is one that is in dire need of diversification and developing the Microbrewery sector is a way of doing so. It will help to achieve the following;

Create new businesses for entrepreneurs and business owners
Create jobs for our ever increasing youth population in Nigeria
Create part time jobs for retired corporate executives that we will tap to provide additional resources for our training programmes. 
Create additional sources of revenue for government in terms of excise duties, taxes, corporate and personal income taxes.
Provide new markets for our farmers (grains etc)

You contributions will be helping to solve part of the social problems in Nigeria.

Risks & Challenges
Like all human endeavours, there are risks and challenges associated with every new venture. some that we have identified are as follows;

Getting the relevant regulatory approvals (Customs, NAFDAC, SON etc) to set up the Microbrewery and the approval of the National Board for Technical Education (if we found it necessary) as it relates to the Brewing School since this is a vocational training school.
Creating awareness about the existence of the Brewing School
Building trust in people that we can actually deliver on our promise
Building a market for Craft Beer.

Since we are not planning to set up a theoretical training school, setting up the Microbrewery is central for us to be able to actualize this project. In terms of getting the relevant regulatory approval, we are aware that a Microbrewery has started operating in Abuja and that is a good precedent that will help to quicken the issuance of our own excise licence to us by the Nigeria Customs services. However, we cannot apply for the licence until we are sure of the extent of funding we can raise. Once we get the excise license from Customs, it becomes easy to get the import permit from the Standard Organisation of Nigeria (SON) to import the Microbrewery equipment. Once the equipment are installed, the National Agency for Foods and Drugs Administration and Control (NAFDAC) will be invited to inspect and certify the Microbrewery.  
Oladapo Loto is a seasoned Brewer with long years of experience in the Industry whose experience includes relating with Regulatory authorities. He knows what to do to overcome issues relating to Government regulations.
We intends to start a massive social media campaign to create awareness for the Brewing School and the Microbrewery. Since the Microbrewery will be functioning, we will hold promotional events across Lagos especially in high profile bars, event centres and top Hotels. During the promotional events, we will also promote the Brewing School. 
Our Trainees and visitors will help us to create goodwill for the project once they can experience the facilities we have in place and the quality of our instructions.
As stated previously, the success of the commercial side of the project (marketing of craft beer from the Microbrewery) will help to build awareness for craft beer and help to start building the market for craft beer.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm Mark Canty, a wine drinking - craft beer loving Aeronautical Engineer who is looking to share the passion for wine and beer across Chicago and hopefully America!  I have had a successful run of 25 years or so (I'm 44 so can't admit to much more than that) at finding the right craft beer or gem of a wine.  </p>
<p>SpendWitty is launching two new clubs in Chicago, a wine club and a brewery club.  As members, you will be able to redeem monthly benefits at various Brewery's and Restaurants throughout Chicago each month.  These clubs will also provide our members unique opportunities for weekly meet ups, raffles, daily specials and events. </p>
<p>We have built the technology and are currently beta testing our APP at a few bars in the burbs.  </p>
<p>We are looking for 1000 people to be part of the launch of these two exclusive clubs.  By supporting the campaign and expressing interest, you will be helping us gain more initial vendors for our April 15th Tax Day launch.  The more support we get, the more vendors we will be able to include in our launch. </p>
<p>Each contributor will be invited (plus 1) to our kickoff event in Downers Grove in May of this year.  </p>
<p>Interested in seeing the tech, you can download the SpendWitty APP now.    We will have all of our participating vendors loaded by April 15!​</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking just support in the belief that a club that provides members benefits across multiple locations at a fair price is of value to both vendors and members.  The contribution you make will be rewarded with the opportunity to join our clubs with a free month of membership as well as entry to our inaugural party in May.   Looking for something more, join our steering committee and help us assure our clubs are run with members best interest at heart. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We believe that these clubs will not only present members great value and experiences, but also support local small businesses and communities.  The more we can visit local Brewery's and restaurants, their chances for success improves.  Their success assures we have fun, new and exciting local places to visit. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>While the club concept has been proven successful, there is always risk with launching a new business.   We have proven the technology and beta testing it now.   To best mitigate our risks, our ability to add members is critical to our success.   Vendors will not want to be part of a club where membership does not affect their bottom line.  We will work tirelessly to gain both members for our vendors and participating vendors for our members!</p>

It’s Qi standard compliant, so you can use it for charging other IOT devices and smart phones.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: Why plastic and not glass?</strong></p><p>A: Because it is high quality plastics (Tritan), shatter resistance, so if it falls down it will not be damaged. Furthermore you can bring it also where the glass is not allowed. It looks like glass, until you drop it.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: Are there any precautions to hold for the washing?</strong></p><p>A: No. The electronics are waterproof, so the glass can be wash in dishwasher. Thanks to the high quality material, it  retains its gloss even after hundreds of dishwasher cycles.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: Why should I buy Ebrost® while I can find it on the “Ebrost® point”?</strong></p><p>A: Ebrost® is not only a glass, it’s also a trendy object which you can use at home with your friends. By using your own glass when you go to the “Ebrost® point”, you get a discounted price for the drink. This means that you recover some of the initial cost of the glass, while you have the full use of it.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: What about the hygienic preservation during the going travel and the bag cleaned during the back?</strong></p><p>A: Every Ebrost® is provided with a silicon cup to hermetical isolate the internal of the glass and the lips contact zone  during the travel.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: Being that the app is free and everyone can download it, even if they don’t have an Ebrost® glass, will there be advertising?</strong></p><p>A: There will be no banners or external advertising announcements. Only the events promoted by the “Ebrost® point” and the “Ebrost® service” will be presented. You can disable them at any time, filter after which zone you want or select individually. You can also set if you want to see them as notifications or only when you go to the related section in the app.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: I’m the owner of a pub that wants to become an “Ebrost® point” and administer drinks from both my own glasses and from private glasses. Can I distinguish between the different types?</strong></p><p>A: If you purchase at least 12 Ebrost® glasses, you have the possibility to personalize them with the logo of your pub. They will then be printed as a visible but transparent image on the inside bottom of the glasses.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: I’m the owner of a pub that wants to become an “Ebrost® point”. Can I avoid to discount the drinks of the “Ebrost Friends” that come with yours own glasses?</strong></p><p>A: In the app you can notify if your place have its own glasses, if you give drinks to external Ebrost Glasses or both. But if you give drinks to external Ebrost Glasses you MUST offer a discount or a larger quantity of drink at the same price.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: Why is it so expensive compared to other glass solutions?</strong></p><p>A: For many reasons: 1) Because this is the first glass wireless charged and configurable via smart phone. 2) Because the wireless battery charger is included. 3) Because all the materials are the best on the market, for safety and characteristics, and it is made to work for many years and resist to hundreds dishwashers cycles. 4) Because it is completely made in Italy by companies selected for them ethic characteristics and not for the lowest cost.</p><p> </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Other Ways You Can Help</h2><p>Thank you for your support.</p><p>Please share the campaign and ask to your favourite pub owner to become an Ebrost® Point, as Ebrost® is not just the glass but it is a community of friends and places.</p><p> </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">VIDEO IN OTHER LANGUAGES</h2><p>EBROST® DA</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tp7EkmfrioA?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><p> </p><p>EBROST® DE </p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/cQoeUYwvStQ?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><div> </div><div>EBROST® ES</div><div>

It’s Qi standard compliant, so you can use it for charging other IOT devices and smart phones. Q: Why plastic and not glass?A: Because it is high quality plastics (Tritan), shatter resistance, so if it falls down it will not be damaged.

But if you give drinks to external Ebrost Glasses you MUST offer a discount or a larger quantity of drink at the same price. Q: Why is it so expensive compared to other glass solutions?A: For many reasons: 1) Because this is the first glass wireless charged and configurable via smart phone. 2) Because the wireless battery charger is included. 3) Because all the materials are the best on the market, for safety and characteristics, and it is made to work for many years and resist to hundreds dishwashers cycles. 4) Because it is completely made in Italy by companies selected for them ethic characteristics and not for the lowest cost. Other Ways You Can HelpThank you for your support.Please share the campaign and ask to your favourite pub owner to become an Ebrost® Point, as Ebrost® is not just the glass but it is a community of friends and places. VIDEO IN OTHER LANGUAGESEBROST® DA EBROST® DE  EBROST® ES

So we set out to design a bar tool that would simplify the process of spirit infusions. By marrying the timeless design of the classic distilling equipment with the beautiful simplicity of Italian espresso makers, Barmixta makes the art of infusion easy.SIMPLE USER EXPERIENCESTEP 1. Place ingredients and pods such as  fruits, spices, roots or botanicals into Barmixta’s stainless steel infusion basket, and then add a base alcohol like whiskey, gin, vodka or tequila into the base container.STEP 2. Lock in place the infusion basket, press the on button, and The Barmixta will begin heating up the alcohol to unleash the natural flavors from your chosen infusion.STEP 3. Watch the infused spirit pour out into the chilled collection container.  Once infusion is complete serve the infused spirit directly from the Barmixta collection container, or mix with other elements to create fresh, premium cocktails. Prototype Development Stage 1 - Proof of Concept  Stage 2 - Minimum Viable product (MVP) Stage 3 - CAD Sketch of Future design  FRESH INGREDIENTS.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Fine sparkling wine rarely meets most consumers in the UK. </p>
<p>Supermarket supplies are low quality, mass produced wines whereas the online wine specialists are largely geared towards red and white wines. Bubble Box has been created by two people who love sparkling wine no matter what the occasion and travel the world to find the best bottles. They now want to bring that passion to everyone else in the UK who want to enjoy fine sparkling wine deliveries every month. </p>
<p>Every month we will deliver a box of fine sparkling wine customised to your tastes alongside added extras including cocktail recipes, ingredients and treats. We want to make enjoying fine sparkling wine simple and fun so you can enjoy fine sparkling wine at home any time. </p>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to get started, we need to import bottles at a significant volume hence why we need to get early adopters on board to assist with cash flow. We have estimated that orders over £1,000 allow us to get the best prices so this £5,000 we hope to raise will give us the option to secure good volume deals at 5 different independent vineyards. </p>
<p>If we were to start low with low volumes of subscribers then the price we would pay for bottles would be uneconomic. We would like to find people who would love to subscribe in order to bulk buy sparkling wine and ensure that we can offer our monthly boxes at sensible prices right from the start. </p>
<p>We never intend to offer discounts other than first box deals as this is a premium product, therefore the extended discounts included here will be a one time offer which we hope you will enjoy. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We will be following through with this project regardless of funding, so even if we do not hit the target then we will honour all of the orders. If there are any issues, then we have signed up to Indiegogo's reserve fund and therefore refunds are guaranteed. This just allows us to kick start at a profitable level which will mean we can invest in the customer experience straight away and ensure we can continue to explore and import from the best vineyards. </p>

<p>HISTORY</p>
<p>Relations between the two unique countries that share the island of Quisqueya, Haiti and the Dominican Republic, have been intense and complex. In the last few decades, the progress of the Dominican economy has inspired a strong migratory movement of unskilled Haitian workers. It is calculated that more than one million Haitian immigrants live in the Dominican Republic, representing over 15% of the population.</p>
<p>Historically, the immigrants have dedicated themselves to cutting sugar cane, although without documentation (passports, birth certificates, visas, etc.). The sugar cane companies have offered them cards that identify them as company workers.  With this card they receive their salary, their insurance, and the cards can also be used as valid documents in the civil registry to declare their children.</p>
<p>With the passing of years, some of these temporary workers have wound up creating and living their lives in a more permanent form in the sugar cane fields. Some have families, while others live alone. The latter find themselves in an especially precarious situation.</p>
<p>Between 60 and 70 years of age, these elders have dedicated their lives to cutting sugar cane, and now are without a pension, due to a lack of awareness of their rights, and the complexity of the formalities. They do not have the money for the multiple trips that would be required to obtain their pension. They do not speak the language of the country, and do not know how to read or write. They are asked for identification documents that were never required for their years of labor (passport, visa, etc.). Without a pension, they depend solely on their ability to work to survive.  </p>
<p>The clock is against them. It is only a matter of time before they become sick due to their age and their poor level of nutrition. Without family, and without work, their sicknesses become increasingly severe until they simply die without ever receiving the pension they have worked towards their whole life.</p>
<p>The Association 180 for Cooperation and Development has created the youth group “Jóvenes de la Milagrosa Dispuestos a Superarse (JMDS),” or the Youth of Milagrosa Willing to Overcome. The group consists of community youth members that have organized themselves in response to the most pressing needs of their community. This group has identified 382 elders without pensions. Of those, 24 are in an extremely vulnerable situation due to health and nutrition concerns. Since 2011, this group has accompanied the elders through each step of the process in order to receive their pension. Some have finalized the process, but we find ourselves at the mercy of the authorities to review and accept each individual case.</p>
<p>Efforts have been made to guarantee a minimum level of nutrition and access to health care services in urgent cases. These efforts are the motivation for the presentation of this project that aims to improve and guarantee a better quality of life for these elders.</p>
<p><strong>Main Objective:</strong></p>
<p>To improve the quality of life for the elders that are without family or support by providing food, health care, and assistance in securing a pension, so that they may live an independent life. We hope to guarantee emergency health services for the people of the <i>batey </i>that, due to geographic distance and/or limited resources, find themselves cut off from basic rights.</p>

<p>La relación entre los dos únicos países que conviven en la isla de Quisqueya,  Haití y República Dominicana, ha sido intensa y compleja.

<p>Históricamente los inmigrantes se han dedicado al corte de caña azúcar, aun sin tener ningún documentación (pasaporte, acta de nacimiento, visado…) Las empresas cañeras les han ofrecido una tarjeta que les  identifica como trabajadores de la compañía. Con está tarjeta han cobrado y cobran su salario, cotizaban al seguro e incluso han sido utilizadas como documento valido en el registro civil para declarar a sus hijos.</p>
<p>Con el paso de los años, algunos de estos trabajadores temporales, se han acabado instalando y viviendo de forma permanente en los cañaverales. Algunos tienen sus familias, otros viven solos. Son especialmente estos últimos los que se encuentran en una situación de mayor debilidad. </p>
<p>Con edades que rondan los 60 y 70 años, habiendo dedicado toda su vida al corte de caña de azúcar, ahora no pueden cobrar su pensión. Ya sea porqué desconocen sus derechos y la complejidad de los tramites. Tampoco disponen del dinero para hacer los múltiples viajes que se requieren. No hablan el idioma del país o no saben escribir y leer. En última instancia les piden todos los documentos de identidad, que no les pidieron nunca para trabajar (pasaporte, visado…) Sin pensión dependen de su fuerza de trabajo para sobrevivir.</p>
<p>Se encuentran a contra reloj. Solo es cuestión de tiempo que enfermen por su edad y por su bajo nivel de alimentación. Sin familia, y sin trabajar, sus enfermedades se hacen cada vez más graves hasta que simplemente mueren sin percibir la pensión por la que han cotizado toda su vida. </p>

<h3>Our Goals</h3>
<p>   Within this campaign, we're aiming to achieve some major goals that we hope you'll become a part of:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, we're focusing on the development of Exxe's product base. This means funding the costs to develop Exxe so that it has a desired flavor and effect. We've already formed a relationship with a partner company, but we require the funding in order to move forward. $20,000 of our target goal is in order to begin this process.</li>
<li>Second, we need to establish the design standards for Exxe. This includes guaranteeing that the product meets all standards for packaging, preparation, and customer satisfaction.</li>
<li>Third, we aim to expand the name out to retailers, investors, and other sources that will help us bring the product to market.</li>
</ul>
<p>   Overall, we want to create an awesome product that serves as the perfect solution for consumers who, on a day-to-day basis, struggle with stress or anxiety.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485708873/ftutrxtu8rfux6nh8lnw.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<h3>""How did it all start?""</h3>
<p>   At the age of 18, I began to notice a growing trend during my time at high school and college. Many people struggle daily from stress or anxiety. Whether it be at school or at the workplace, we all seem to face it throughout our lives. But this stress can leave a serious toll on people's health and well-being. For too long, I felt like I couldn't do anything to help fight against this growing trend of stress. But during my senior year in high school, I knew it was time to make a change, and after months of research, I came up with Exxe.</p>
<h3>""So, what exactly is Exxe?""</h3>
<p>   For many years, many have conceived the idea that we need caffeine to empower ourselves to do the things we love. Exxe is here to change that. Many don't like the jittery feeling or the drowsy after-effect that caffeine beverages provide. Not to mention, both coffee and energy drinks are usually loaded with sugar and artificial sweeteners. This formula is a recipe for disaster when it comes to individuals who are looking to lower stress and stay healthy. That being said, Exxe offers a different approach.</p>
<p>   Exxe fits into a category of products known as 'relaxation beverages', which are part of an emerging market aimed towards helping the user find relaxation and lower stress. In an age of nine to five workers and schedule-filled college students, this industry serves as a prominent solution towards aiding the fight against stress and anxiety.</p>
<p>   The formulation beats any in the industry. Practically all relaxation beverages limit themselves to one relaxation ingredient. Exxe stands out from the industry norm, and involves a specialized combination of over three major ingredients.</p>
<p>   Using a variety of natural chemicals &amp; amino acids that help improve focus, calm the mind, and overall aid you into a relaxing state, Exxe serves as a perfect replacement. Exxe contains healthy dosages of each chemical, along with monk fruit, a natural, zero calorie sweetener. Here's a list of the main ingredients found in Exxe:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485566639/t8slkohudsndtsi7hs0q.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>   Not only do we believe in building a quality product that helps you relax, but we also want to bring a sense of purpose behind the product. Exxe is centered around the idea of relaxation and lowering stress, a frequent problem in today's world.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485621478/vq9y9rryyuhtqjxycsot.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>   That being said, we're committing over 10% of profits from sales towards mental health research; more than any other relaxation beverage on the market. Exxe isn't the ultimate solution towards ridding society of anxiety and stress. To truly solve this problem, we must get to the root cause. That being said, we want to commit towards doing our part.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486416219/u3jvzgacsbtmc0yownjt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>   Are your taste buds curious? If so, Exxe has you covered. We've planned three different flavors for the formulation pipeline. Each contains a different approach at finding your sense of relaxation. So far, we only plan to offer one flavor at launch. However, if we can reach our stretch goals, the process of developing the other two flavors can happen at a much faster rate, and we will be able to offer them as well at launch.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
<p>   We're have set our goal towards raising $25,000, but we are prepared to raise more. If we do raise above our set goal, we will work towards further improving Exxe in the following ways:</p>Stretch Goal #1 ($30,000):<ul><li>A new, professional website design to improve our online appearance.</li></ul>
<p>Stretch Goal #2 ($60,000):</p>
<ul>
<li>Merchandise will become available on the website. We will offer t-shirts and posters to start, but there's a possibility that we could expand our horizons.</li>
<li>How does a new flavor sound? If reached, we'll include a new flavor at launch.</li>
</ul>
<p>Stretch Goal #3 ($100,000): </p>
<ul>
<li>How about a third flavor? Just like our previous stretch goal, if met, we'll develop a third flavor ready for launch.</li>

</div></div>","Our Goals
   Within this campaign, we're aiming to achieve some major goals that we hope you'll become a part of:

First, we're focusing on the development of Exxe's product base. This means funding the costs to develop Exxe so that it has a desired flavor and effect. We've already formed a relationship with a partner company, but we require the funding in order to move forward. $20,000 of our target goal is in order to begin this process.
Second, we need to establish the design standards for Exxe. This includes guaranteeing that the product meets all standards for packaging, preparation, and customer satisfaction.
Third, we aim to expand the name out to retailers, investors, and other sources that will help us bring the product to market.

   Overall, we want to create an awesome product that serves as the perfect solution for consumers who, on a day-to-day basis, struggle with stress or anxiety.


""How did it all start?""
   At the age of 18, I began to notice a growing trend during my time at high school and college. Many people struggle daily from stress or anxiety. Whether it be at school or at the workplace, we all seem to face it throughout our lives. But this stress can leave a serious toll on people's health and well-being. For too long, I felt like I couldn't do anything to help fight against this growing trend of stress. But during my senior year in high school, I knew it was time to make a change, and after months of research, I came up with Exxe.
""So, what exactly is Exxe?""
   For many years, many have conceived the idea that we need caffeine to empower ourselves to do the things we love. Exxe is here to change that. Many don't like the jittery feeling or the drowsy after-effect that caffeine beverages provide. Not to mention, both coffee and energy drinks are usually loaded with sugar and artificial sweeteners. This formula is a recipe for disaster when it comes to individuals who are looking to lower stress and stay healthy. That being said, Exxe offers a different approach.
   Exxe fits into a category of products known as 'relaxation beverages', which are part of an emerging market aimed towards helping the user find relaxation and lower stress. In an age of nine to five workers and schedule-filled college students, this industry serves as a prominent solution towards aiding the fight against stress and anxiety.
   The formulation beats any in the industry. Practically all relaxation beverages limit themselves to one relaxation ingredient. Exxe stands out from the industry norm, and involves a specialized combination of over three major ingredients.
   Using a variety of natural chemicals & amino acids that help improve focus, calm the mind, and overall aid you into a relaxing state, Exxe serves as a perfect replacement. Exxe contains healthy dosages of each chemical, along with monk fruit, a natural, zero calorie sweetener. Here's a list of the main ingredients found in Exxe:

   Not only do we believe in building a quality product that helps you relax, but we also want to bring a sense of purpose behind the product. Exxe is centered around the idea of relaxation and lowering stress, a frequent problem in today's world.

   That being said, we're committing over 10% of profits from sales towards mental health research; more than any other relaxation beverage on the market. Exxe isn't the ultimate solution towards ridding society of anxiety and stress. To truly solve this problem, we must get to the root cause. That being said, we want to commit towards doing our part.

   Are your taste buds curious? If so, Exxe has you covered. We've planned three different flavors for the formulation pipeline. Each contains a different approach at finding your sense of relaxation. So far, we only plan to offer one flavor at launch. However, if we can reach our stretch goals, the process of developing the other two flavors can happen at a much faster rate, and we will be able to offer them as well at launch.

Stretch Goals
   We're have set our goal towards raising $25,000, but we are prepared to raise more. If we do raise above our set goal, we will work towards further improving Exxe in the following ways:Stretch Goal #1 ($30,000):A new, professional website design to improve our online appearance.
Stretch Goal #2 ($60,000):

Merchandise will become available on the website. We will offer t-shirts and posters to start, but there's a possibility that we could expand our horizons.
How does a new flavor sound? If reached, we'll include a new flavor at launch.

Stretch Goal #3 ($100,000): 

How about a third flavor? Just like our previous stretch goal, if met, we'll develop a third flavor ready for launch.
This amount will officially give us enough to mass manufacture and distribute to nationwide retailers.

<p><strong>WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE PART OF THE FUTURE, DO A POSITIVE IMPACT AND BE PART OF THE COMMUNITY?</strong></p>
<p>We aim to provide communities with a platform, where they can share, taste, monetize, and explore their unique culinary experiences with family, friends, colleagues, strangers, or those in need!</p>
<p>We are a startup of 4 founders based in Stockholm, Sweden, but individually we have a different background, but we all have the same intentions to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CONNECT COMMUNITIES THROUGH FOOD</strong></li>
<li><strong>SAVE FOOD, HELP THE PLANET</strong></li>
<li><strong>START SAVING DELICIOUS SURPLUS FOOD</strong></li>
<li><strong>CREATING REAL CHANGE</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Each co-founder is a different nationality (1x Sweden/Kuwait, 1x Czech, 2x India), for the last year we have been working remotely, building a startup remotely was a huge rollercoaster, but we can't be prouder how we got here. </p>
<p>Two founders already have previous entrepreneurial experience, one founder has a successful entrepreneurial experience, against all odds, he managed to build taxijakt.se while fighting the Goliath (Uber and Bolt).</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Do We Need To Make The Change?</h3>
<p>We aim for 150,000 EUR </p>
<ul>
<li>For that, we are planning to build a new Web App and Native App Development (<strong>80k EUR</strong>)</li>
<li>Partner-up with Cloud Kitchens (give chefs an opportunity to rent-out a real kitchen) - (We will pay the first month as a trial period: <strong>10k EUR</strong>) </li>
<li>Starter Packages for chefs (meal boxes - to pack their meals in, apron, brochure, mask, plastic gloves) <strong>(5k EUR) </strong>
</li>
<li>Delivery Solution Partnership (Will be ECO, already partnered up with weride.nu) (<strong>5k EUR</strong>)</li>
<li>Marketing and Operations <strong>(50k EUR)</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For that amount, we will be able to build a truly unique platform with exciting features. We already have the Development Proposal with requirements. </p>
<p>The platform will include the following features: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Timelapse video</strong> (1min timelapse video, sequences during the cooking, the user then can see, how the meal was prepared in a quick video - just like Tiktok or IG reels!) </li>
<li>
<strong>Streaming</strong> (Chefs can stream through the time they cook! Chefs during their cooking period can stream themselves - do you also miss going through the food market and seeing all the great meals come together?) </li>
<li>
<strong>Verification process</strong> (Smooth, not-annoying, quick on-boarding process for chefs)</li>
<li>
<strong>Shout-out feature</strong> (If you are hungry, raise hungry requests and chefs nearby will send you their offers)</li>
<li>
<strong>Donation option</strong> (Buy a meal to a homeless shelter, partnered up with food-banks)</li>
<li>
<strong>Partners/Affiliate program</strong> (Home Chefs, Bloggers, Farmers, Restaurants can register)</li>
<li>
<strong>Home-restaurant</strong> (Add staff account, you can have a dedicated driver that will deliver meals for you!) </li>

<h3>The Impact - Building Communities</h3>
<p>People and communities are being polarized each day, we are sending people to Mars, yet over 800 million people go to bed with an empty stomach, yet we are in an economic recession, where thousands of restaurants go bankrupt each day and tens of thousands of people lose them jobs.</p>
<p>Let's give equal opportunities to everyone! Allow anyone to share and monetize their meal or food! </p>
<p>It's hard for a regular person that has its own production to get recognized in a supermarket, allow them to give you products made with love, that are local and paints a smile at the end of the day!</p>
<p>Eat local. Eat affordable. Eat healthy. Waste less.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We do always get a question and doubts regarding hygiene and how can we ensure the food from the chefs fulfills certain hygiene standards and how the local authorities are opened towards this idea? </p>
<p>That was always our threat and priority at the same time. Nevertheless, thanks to our strict onboarding process, and rating system (just like Uber and Airbnb) we can provide the consumers with the same safety as any other restaurant. Individuals do value their business, quality, and transparency even more as their head depends on that. </p>
<p>The community has been here ever since and soon if there's someone in your community that does not behave well, it will get quickly out there! Just out of curiosity, go to the Facebook marketplace, write ""Food"" and see how many people try to sell food out there, without even being permitted!  Therefore, in the end, we are a credible source of home-made dishes!</p>
<p>In Plate Hero, when on-boarding chefs, we do ask them for 7 photos of their kitchen, including their ID and signature meal. We do have a 30-minutes brief call with them to get them to know even better and see if they have the right intentions.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We appreciate any kind of help! We aim to make an impact all over the world, but without your help, it will take us longer! </p>
<p>We would love you to be part of our ambassador program, spread the word, and love in your region and we will make sure to support you as much as we can, so the communities can be united and share the great moments at the table together!</p>
<p>Share the campaign with your friends, family, colleagues, neighbors so we can be soon in your city too! </p>

The modern food industry uses this factor to markup prices on organic food very sharply in order to increase margins.

For example: preservatives are used to prevent products from going bad, growth hormones make animals grow faster, antibiotics are used on livestock to eradicate illnesses and sicknesses, and GMO is used to give plants traits which don't occur naturally; there are many more such uses.But these synthetic additives pose many health risks, as they are made in laboratories from chemicals which are damaging to our health. Preservatives are linked to breathing problems, asthma and bronchitis. GMO products contribute to the development of cancer. Artificial colourings can cause cancer and aggressiveness in children. Pesticides have links to blindness and can even cause death. Flavour enhancers can cause nausea and breathing problems.Hence FreshOrganic.How it worksFreshOrganic’s online store has been designed to be as simple as possible for our clients´ convenience. Go on FreshOrganic.org, choose the desired products and we will deliver them to your doorstep anywhere in the world.What we offerFreshOrganic.org offers a wide variety of organic products, including:Baby careBeauty productsBody careCanned foodCharcuterieCheeseCoffeeDried foodsDrinksHome productsHygieneOilsPicklesSnacksSuperfoodsSweetsTeaHow we created our networkBefore the pandemic we traveled throughout Europe and met many organic suppliers, including farmers and producers. We researched their production methods and made sure they followed the guidelines for ultimate organic production.This way we created a network of organic suppliers who can be found in our FreshOrganic.org online store.Background of the FreshOrganic projectThe project was co-founded by brothers Mikhail and Andrey Yasenyavskiy. Mikhail studied architecture at the Politecnico di Milano. Andrey studied international politics at Bocconi, Milano. Both have researched the production methods of the conventional food industry and decided to revolutionize it. This led to the concept of FreshOrganic. As they had previously worked together, Mikhail and Andrey asked their friends to join the team in order to bring the FreshOrganic idea to life. Having created a synergy of four people, the project FreshOrganic obtained its shape and was ready to launch.Our FreshOrganic MembershipWe have developed a project through which organic products are affordable for everyone. Organic farming is a process which requires a lot of effort and special technologies. Labour input is high, and output is low in relation to the demand. Therefore organic products come at a higher price than conventional products of the food industry. The modern food industry uses this factor to markup prices on organic food very sharply in order to increase margins. This makes healthy products unaffordable for most people.We have decided to take a stance on this issue. We provide organic food at prices which are affordable for everyone.And for only 99 EUR you can become a FreshOrganic member for a year and receive discounts of up to 50% on all products.Consider the magnitude of what your contributions will help to achieveWe are thankful to our backers in advance for their extraordinary support which will give us the opportunity to stock up on organic products and start to bring joy to FreshOrganic.org customers by supplying tasty and especially healthy food.RisksOur risks lie in the fact that our suppliers are small organic farmers and producers and are producing small quantities of quality product. We run the risk that demand might be higher than supply, and we do not want to lower our production standards in order to produce more quickly and in larger quantities.In that case we would increase our organic suppliers network, thus offering our clients an even larger variety of healthy organic produce.ChallengesOur biggest challenge is to battle the conventional food industry which uses poison in the food it produces and puts at risk the health of its customers.The conventional food industry invests billions of dollars in pretty but unhealthy products; overcoming this competition will only be possible with your help.Support us to be part of a movement which fights for a greener planet and a healthier world!Organic farmers will receive our support to the fullest extent to enable them to offer their produce to global consumers. Organic farmers and producers need FreshOrganic and we need you for a healthier and greener future.We try harder and are ready to work for the good of humanity.How much money we need and for whatFor a successful project launch we require a total of 25 000 EUR.This is needed for our first stock-up of organic products.

<p>My name is Bob Bottieri and I am an artist.I'm a painter,Production Designer for film and most recently a distiller. It is said that distilling is 75% science and 25% art. It is that 25% that Intrigues me. We at One Foot Crow approach the craft as an art form.</p>
<p>We have worked hard and have overcome a variety of challenges both financial and bureaucratic but now our goal is in sight. We are down to the details. The bottles,the pumps and hoses, the final finishes to our tasting room. Contributions can take us there and are the final puffs in our balloon.</p>
</div><div>
<p>We have set a goal of 24,000.00. Any part of this goal will be helpful in bringing our dream to fruition. All contributions over 75.00 will receive a 500ml bottle of our 100 Proof spirits, either Vodka or Gin. Contributors of 700.00 or more will receive a case of twelve 500ml bottles.</p>
<p>As with any business venture, there are risks. That we will produce a fantastic product is not in question. The challenge will be in bringing our products to market. We do have a vigorous campaign in mind. We plan to market in Japan, where both Canadian spirits and black food and drinks enjoy a great deal of popularity.</p>
