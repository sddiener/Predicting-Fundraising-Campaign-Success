<br/><h3 align=""center""><b>How Does InVitalShare Work</b></h3><p>First, the parent of a child with a special care need, in this case a food allergy, signs up and creates a profile for their child. This profile includes basic information like their name, age, height, and weight. The parent then enters details regarding their child’s care needs such as:</p><ul>
<li>Allergies</li>
<li>Triggers</li>
<li>Favorite foods and snacks that they can safely eat</li>
<li>Dangerous foods that should be avoided</li>
<li>Restaurants and menu items that are ok to order</li>
<li>Special care instructions on what to do if a problem should occur</li>
<li>Emergency contacts that can be called in the event of an emergency.</li>
</ul><p>The items listed above are just examples of the types of lists that can be created. A user has the ability to create as many lists as they want, name them accordingly, and enter any type of information within that list. InVitalShare is completely flexible and allows you to share ANY type if information with ANYONE. </p><p><br/></p><center><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433132865/bkv8ut3j2rbhqwehhvou.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></center><br/><p><br/></p><p>Once a profile has been created, the parent enters the email addresses of the caregivers, selects only the pieces of information they want to share, and the amount of time that the information can be seen. </p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>The caregivers then receive the invitation by email and can instantly
view the details through a mobile app or the inVitalShare website. Once
the caregivers have this information, it’s always available and
accessible wherever they are. Users of the inVitalShare mobile apps,
which will be available for iPhone, iPad, and Android devices, also have
 secure access to the information even if an internet connection isn’t
available.</p>

<br/><br/><br/><div align=""center""><h3><b>How Much Will InVitalShare Cost</b></h3></div>
<p>inVitalShare is designed to be extremely secure, easy to use, and cost effective for any parent. As a subscription service, parents sharing information (Sharing account) can do so for under $5 a month.  Caregivers that receive access to this information, pay nothing at all. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 align=""center""><b>Why Is It Called InVitalShare</b></h3>
<p>Because<b> In</b>vitation based <b>Vital</b> information <b>Shar</b>ing was too long of a name! </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 align=""center""><b>Why Do We Need Your Help </b></h3>We recognize how important your family’s vital care information is, so we want to do this right. Building an app is easy. Building an extremely secure, yet easy to use system which includes web access and mobile apps for both IOS (iPhone, iPad, etc) and Android devices however, is very complicated and expensive. It takes a team of skilled professionals with the right experience and resources to create a service like InVitalShare. We’ve got the team, now we need to put them to work!<br/><p><br/></p>
<p>You may ask, “That’s a strange number. Why $143,000?” Well, that’s a fair question. Most importantly, it provides what we need to get the first version of InVitalShare built and into the hands of the families who need it by the end of the summer. Anything we raise above this amount will help us get additional features and new functionality built in faster. There is a lot we hope to do with this incredible service so don’t be bashful about sharing if we cross the $143,000 mark. As for the unusual amount, 1-4-3 has a significant meaning for us. Check out the story behind 1-4-3 at the bottom of this page. If you can't decide on a contribution level, we'd recommend the $143 perk. <br/></p>
<br/><p>What happens if we don’t meet our goal? Well, we will use the money our supporters have contributed and secure the funding needed to complete the project through other means. Our hope though is that a small number of the millions of families who deal with food allergies and special care needs will help us surpass our goal and allow us to focus on making InVitalShare available as quickly as possible. You have the power to make that happen!</p>

<b>Drew Smith</b> is the founder and president of InVitalShare. As a father of four, Drew has learned first hand how food allergies and special care needs can impact a family. It was while watching one of his daughter's friends that an incident took place which sparked the idea for InVitalShare. He later experienced the complexities involved with having his own child requiring extremely specialized care. These experiences have resulted in a strong belief that a combination of technology and human interaction can work together to significantly improve the lives of those who deal with food allergies and special care needs. As a successful entrepreneur with a background in broadcasting, information technology, product development, and business management, Drew understands that it takes forethought, planning, the right resources, and a tight team to turn a good idea into a success. Drew is passionate about combining business and technology to help others and InVitalShare is the culmination of those passions.<br/><br/><b>Adam Simcock</b> is the president of Earthling Interactive, a web and mobile application development company located in Madison, Wisconsin. An anthropologist, environmental scientist, and mathematician by training, Adam’s real talent is understanding the way things work. Adam leads Earthling Interactive which approaches every project as a partnership, and that is why we chose them as our development partner for InVitalShare. When we decided to find a developer, three big items needed to be checked off of our list. First, the company had to be US based and have its own staff in-house. Second, the company needed to be willing to work with us long-term and operate almost more as a business partner than a vendor. Third, they needed to have experience designing and developing healthcare related applications and systems. Working with sensitive health information is subject to many regulations and special security considerations. A complete understanding of this area and the skills to apply that knowledge to the design process was paramount. Earthling Interactive surpassed our requirements in each of these areas and we are extremely glad to have chosen them as our development partner. If you have the next big web, mobile, or e commerce idea, be sure to visit <b><a href=""http://bit.ly/1JaSPNX"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_earthling"">Earthling Interactive</a></b> after you contribute! <br/><br/><b>Kevin Selle</b> wears many stylish hats and we love them all! Kevin leverages his skill sets as a broadcaster, communicator, teacher, and geek to enable more effective digital communications with audiences that need the right information, at the right time, in the right form. Kevin is also very familiar with the special considerations and challenges associated with children that have special care needs and the impact that they have on families and caregivers. He is a master of understanding how to craft a message, identify who needs it, and reaching out to those people in an effective and personal manner. The human element of communication is a core component of Kevin’s communication philosophy and he understands that people are much more likely to respond to a personal message than something that feels canned and pulled from a machine. We hold our relationship with our contributors and futures users in the very highest regard and we want them to feel like there are real people working to improve their lives, not just some computers in the corner of a data center churning away and sending automated responses to each inquiry we receive. Kevin is quite possibly the best “people person” we know.<br/><br/><b>The Advisers</b> aren’t a group of mystical beings that communicate with us by means unknown. They are the people who represent every single person that will ever use InVitalShare (woah... no pressure). This incredible group of moms has helped InVitalShare to orient itself and truly understand how our products and services will be used to change lives. Some of our advisers are parents of children who suffer from food allergies and others are parents who regularly care for other children with food allergies and special care needs. These moms are true heroes and there is no way to even begin describing the energy, courage, attention to detail, and unwavering determination they possess in order to ensure that their children and the children they care for live in the safest and most comfortable environment possible. After a successful IndieGoGo campaign, our advisers will play a critical role in helping us to truly revolutionize the way families share vital care information.<br/><br/><b><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><br/></h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><b>The Perks<br/></b></h3></b>We value every single dollar we receive! You have worked hard for it and we want to make it work hard for us. There are a lot of different things we could give you as a way to say thanks for your contribution, but our goal is to help families by making this incredible service available at the most affordable price possible. As a result, our perks will mainly include different lengths of free service for contributors. Don’t need the app yourself, but still want to contribute? First of all, You Rock! Second, you can share your perks with someone who would benefit from them. For those of you who are in a position to really pay it forward, we have a few special ways to say thanks.<br/><br/><p>Take a look at our perks and contribute what you can. If you don't see an option that fits into your budget, simply enter the amount you'd like to contribute in the ""Your Contribution"" area at the top right side of the page and click ""Contribute Now"". If you need help deciding, consider the ""1-4-3 Dedicated to Success"" perk. Remember, every contribution is important no matter the size. Contribute and share right now!<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 align=""center""><b>Unable To Contribute? You Can Still Help</b></h3>Not everyone can make a financial contribution and we understand. You can still help us though! Share our crowdfunding campaign with everyone you know. Post on Facebook, tweet on Twitter, and blog in the blogosphere. Let others know about this life changing project and how they can help us turn an amazing idea into a reality!<br/><p><br/></p>
<br/>
<h3 align=""center""><b>The Story Behind 1-4-3</b></h3>**A note from Drew**<br/>My entire family has shaped me into the person I am today and I'm eternally grateful for that. As an example, my grandfather, Lawrence Sr., introduced me to technology and sparked a lifelong love affair with understanding how it could be used to do amazing things (ahhhh that ham radio and Commodore 64). He also introduced me to the story of 1-4-3. As the story was told, lighthouses many years ago would flash the pattern 1-4-3 to signal “I LOVE YOU” to the sailors on passing ships. That simple number holds a very important place in our family’s life and is used by everyone as the signature of emails, the closing of a quick note, and a general reminder of how we feel about one another. It has also become the reminder to us at InVitalShare of how parents feel for their children and the responsibility we are given when parents entrust their children's care information to us. At InVitalShare, we love what we do and we love who we do it for. #143<br/><br/><br/>
<h3 align=""center""><b>Lodge Roasters Coffee<br/></b></h3>What does coffee have to do with this project? Well, the rewards are called ""Perks"" right? It just so happens that we know of another new business that hand roasts some of the most amazing coffee you'll ever taste. If you are someone who is constantly working hard to care for those around you, a phenomenal cup of coffee is just what you need.<br/><br/>For any stellar supporter that contributes $5,000 or more, you will have an opportunity to enjoy one of the most unique coffee experiences available. The Lodge Roasters Explorer Experience takes roasting coffee to the next level by letting you pick from a list of breathtaking outdoor locations and creating your custom roast on the spot. In addition, you receive a video of the adventure! This is the first time that you've ever been able to enjoy your coffee long after drinking it.<br/><br/><p></p>

After a successful IndieGoGo campaign, our advisers will play a critical role in helping us to truly revolutionize the way families share vital care information.

The Story Behind 1-4-3**A note from Drew**My entire family has shaped me into the person I am today and I'm eternally grateful for that. As an example, my grandfather, Lawrence Sr., introduced me to technology and sparked a lifelong love affair with understanding how it could be used to do amazing things (ahhhh that ham radio and Commodore 64). He also introduced me to the story of 1-4-3. As the story was told, lighthouses many years ago would flash the pattern 1-4-3 to signal “I LOVE YOU” to the sailors on passing ships. That simple number holds a very important place in our family’s life and is used by everyone as the signature of emails, the closing of a quick note, and a general reminder of how we feel about one another. It has also become the reminder to us at InVitalShare of how parents feel for their children and the responsibility we are given when parents entrust their children's care information to us. At InVitalShare, we love what we do and we love who we do it for. #143

<h2><span>This year I found out my grandma has stage 3+ metastatic infiltrating ductal carcinoma. Basically she has a very aggressive form of breast cancer.  This is the second time she has had breast cancer.  She beat it the first time and we know she can beat it again, but she needs help with the cost of the treatments and the travel costs.</span></h2>
<p>She is currently undergoing chemotherapy.  She will have to endure getting radiation 5 days a week for 5 weeks.  She has to go to the hospital frequently for checkups and to meet with surgeons and oncologists.  Several months from now she will need a double masectomy.  The cancer has also spread to her lymph nodes and lungs, meaning the treatments will need to be more intense and there may be a need for additional surgeries to get rid of the cancer that has spread.   </p>
<p>My grandma lives on an island in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.  It's pretty isolated up there.  She has to take a ferry and drive 200 miles anytime she goes to the doctor.  Sometimes the weather is bad and she has to pay to stay overnight near the hospital.  When she has radiation she will have to drive 5 hours away to a hospital in Marquette, MI.  It isn't feasible for her to drive that distance everyday for the radiation, so her and my grandpa will have to find a hotel to stay in and pay for travel costs in addition to medical costs.  My grandparents are retired and live on a fixed income.  These expenses are going to be a big financial burden and they are not sure how they will pay for everything.  The medical costs themselves are extremely expensive.  For one treatment alone she needs 10 shots.  Each shot costs her $1000 after insurance has paid their part.  This is only one of the many treatments she is receiving.</p>
<p>She may also go to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN to get a second opinion.  She could have her treatments done there and enroll in a clinical trial.  If she goes there, the medical costs would increase as well as the travel costs.  However the quality of care would be top-notch and we would know everything that could possibly be done is being done!</p>
<h3>We are asking for $25,000 to help pay for some of the medical expenses associated with the chemotherapy, radiation, and all of the surgeries.  Some of the costs will also go to pay for transportation and lodging during the 5 weeks my grandparents will need to be in Marquette for the radiation treatments.  </h3>
<h2>Anyone can donate!  Donate as little as $1.  Every little bit helps.  Your reward for donating - you can feel good all day knowing that you helped out a loving, kind grandma and put a smile on her face.  Even if you can't donate, how about sharing the link to this fundraiser on twitter, facebook, and other social media sites?  With your help we can show Grandma Karen how much we love and support her!  And we can kick breast cancer to the curb!</h2>

<h2>UPDATE 3/31/13: </h2>
<h2>Hi Everyone! Only 6 days left for the fundraiser and we are almost at $2000. Do you think we can make it? I hope so! Share the link again and spread the word. Grandma Karen needs our help.</h2>
<h2>As an extra incentive, anyone who has donated already and anyone who donates from now on will be sent some of Grandma Karen’s favorite recipes by email after the campaign ends. We all know Grandma loves to cook, she even compiled a huge cookbook for her family a few years ago. One donation means you will get access to recipes for some tasty food – Christmas cookies, the best birthday cake, salads, and dinners. All are Grandma approved!</h2>

<h3>Blindsided</h3>
<p>A couple of months ago, my aunt was admitted to the hospital for stomach pains and bleeding. Tests later revealed that she had a mass in her liver, but doctors were optimistic that surgery could help her get better.</p>
<p>Further tests brought on less optimistic news. They found that the mass in her liver was metastatic and that they could no longer determine the organ from which the cancer started. The blockage in her bile duct was going to be a permanent situation, and so was the tube coming out of her stomach to drain the fluids from it. The cancer has now spread to her pancreas, and neither chemotherapy nor surgery are viable options.</p>
<p>In a short span of time, all this unraveled. My aunt and our entire family were blindsided.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Coming to Terms</h3>
<p>Although she was in the loop with the test results, she had yet to receive a definitive diagnosis. </p>
<p>At her next visit to the oncologist following her stay at the hospital, she was encouraged to ask questions. The first question she asked was ""At what stage am I?""</p>
<p>With two daughters ages 13 and 12, she knew that she had to hear the diagnosis no matter how tough a pill it was going to be to swallow. Time was no longer a luxury to be had. With her family at the forefront of all her priorities, her main goal was to exhaust every avenue possible to get better, or to at least buy a little more time.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>My Aunt</h3>
<p>Her name's Maricel. Actually, it's Maria Cecilia Theresa. My grandparents had a lot of fun with names the day she was born. Her six other siblings only bear one name. Just by that merit, she became special. But to the family, she's affectionately called <strong><em>Ceng.</em></strong></p>
<p>She chose one of the noblest professions I know and became a teacher, taking after my grandmother. I grew up thinking she was one of my stricter aunts, but I now realize that it was her way of imparting the values that she felt were important for us to learn.</p>
<p>Her laughs are infectious, her voice carries across three rooms, and she quite possibly first exposed me to the wonderful world of OCD. She loves her family fiercely, she is deeply connected to her faith, and she lives each day with purpose.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>My name is Billy and I am Ceng's niece. My parents had me young, so my aunt in reality was always more like a big sister to me. I have so many fond memories of her and all of my dad's side of the family--the shenanigans at summer trips, the loud Christmas and New Year celebrations (and I'm not talking about the fireworks, either), even weekly visits to my grandfather's grave that only my family can turn into a (literal) picnic.</p>
<p>Six months ago, I became a mom to a beautiful girl. Now, my aunt's plight hits awfully close to home. I look at my daughter and I imagine myself in her shoes. I imagine my daughter in my little cousins' place. In my gut, I know that I would fight the hand I've been dealt just as hard as my aunt is trying right now.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>With your help...</h3>
<ul>
<li>My aunt would be free to explore the natural and alternative solutions she'd like to try to help improve the quality of her life without burning through her family's savings.</li>
<li>My aunt and her family can go on trips they've planned on (and maybe ones they never thought they could do) and create more happy memories.</li>
<li>You would ease the financial burden that cancer patients are inevitably riddled with.</li>
<li>You would contribute to any unforseen medical expenses, and hopefully also augment their family's savings.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>How You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can relate or even just sympathize with our family's plight, you can help by spreading the word to your family and friends.</p>
<p>There are no perks to be offered, no gifts to be given. Just our appeal to the kindness of others, and our never-ending gratitude that you opened your hearts to us. </p>

<p>We are Brandon's caregivers trying to help him get a stool transplant in order to treat his re-occurring C-diff infections, in order to treat his colitis. Doctors have labeled his condition as ""Indeterminate Colitis"", still not certain whether it was caused by C-diff or an underlying Inflammatory Bowel Disorder-such as Ulcerative Colitis or Crohn's. However, some doctors have had the opinion that his first sigmoidoscopy when he was first admitted to the Hospital in May 2011, showed strong evidence of C-diff perhaps being the cause.</p>
<p>By May 2011, he was going to the bathroom with watery stools and bleeding over 8 times a day, and suffered from anemia, dehydration, and malnutrition. He finally decided he could no longer ignore these symptoms, and forced himself to go to the ER.</p>
<p>A frightening experience awaited him, when he was told the news that these symptoms indicated a ""colitis"" of some kind and that doctors were not certain what exactly caused these symptoms so suddenly, with no prior history of symptoms such as the one's he was suffering from.</p>
<p>Brandon has been to see various doctors, has had colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopies, and other imaging done. There have been several theories, but no definitive answers on what kind of Inflammatory Bowel Condition he actually has.</p>
<p>The facts remain he showed very few signs of the Inflammatory Bowel drugs working to treat his symptoms, but Vancocin and Flagyl did. Whenever he was on those specific drugs his frequency of watery and bloody stools decreased (from over 13 times to 2 per day), however his insurance would only ever pay for a 10 to 14 day supply and after those days were up, his symptoms would return again, and he would have to wait and wait for results of another stool test in order to prove he would qualify for further drug therapy. Basically, because his symptoms of C-diff have re-occurred, and not resolved, he is considered to be a candidate for fecal transplant.</p>
<p>This condition has been a vicious, debilitating, and life-threatening one, with the cycle continuing on and on with no relief in site. One doctor he has seen will not even consider surgery (which is the standard treatment of Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn’s) unless the C-diff has been resolved. Brandon has been suffering 2 years now with re-occurring C-diff infections and colitis symptoms, and his only hope is a stool transplant.</p>
<p>This campaign is important to Brandon, because it really seems his only chance at recovering from C-diff. We have heard good stories from articles about stool transplants and have contacted a GI clinic that has had successful treatment.</p>
<p>The magnitude of your contribution will dramatically offer a real chance for Brandon to recover from C-diff and potentially improve the inflammation caused by the colitis aspect of it. You will help fund a procedure that has a greater background of safety. You will support a treatment that has saved lives. Your participation will raise awareness of the disease and this treatment becoming more available.</p>
<p>We are in contact with a GI clinic in near Harrisburg, PA.</p>

The facts remain he showed very few signs of the Inflammatory Bowel drugs working to treat his symptoms, but Vancocin and Flagyl did. Whenever he was on those specific drugs his frequency of watery and bloody stools decreased (from over 13 times to 2 per day), however his insurance would only ever pay for a 10 to 14 day supply and after those days were up, his symptoms would return again, and he would have to wait and wait for results of another stool test in order to prove he would qualify for further drug therapy. Basically, because his symptoms of C-diff have re-occurred, and not resolved, he is considered to be a candidate for fecal transplant.
This condition has been a vicious, debilitating, and life-threatening one, with the cycle continuing on and on with no relief in site. One doctor he has seen will not even consider surgery (which is the standard treatment of Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn’s) unless the C-diff has been resolved. Brandon has been suffering 2 years now with re-occurring C-diff infections and colitis symptoms, and his only hope is a stool transplant.
This campaign is important to Brandon, because it really seems his only chance at recovering from C-diff. We have heard good stories from articles about stool transplants and have contacted a GI clinic that has had successful treatment.
The magnitude of your contribution will dramatically offer a real chance for Brandon to recover from C-diff and potentially improve the inflammation caused by the colitis aspect of it. You will help fund a procedure that has a greater background of safety. You will support a treatment that has saved lives. Your participation will raise awareness of the disease and this treatment becoming more available.
We are in contact with a GI clinic in near Harrisburg, PA.

<p>In 2007, Clyde slipped and fell, hurting his back which resulted in him heading to the hospital.

<p>Life after bladder cancer is not easy. A non-painful hernia resulted post bladder surgery, and worse, Clyde began developing kidney stones as a result of the low grade infection his body was constantly fighting off.

<p>But, like any medical service rendered, the procedures and supervision time by the wonderful people who saved his life cost money.

Unfortunately, this means that times are about to become very tough for this guy that we all love and care about so very much. Possibly resulting in the bankruptcy of the company which he worked so hard to build.</p>
<h2>BUT YOU CAN HELP!</h2>
<p>How? Well, I'm glad you asked. There are a couple ways</p>
<h2>Give To This Campaign</h2>
<p>Our goal is to raise $2,500 through this campaign. Helping offset the cost of medical bills and personal expenses (already ranging into the hundred thousands), this money could be the difference between saving or losing his business. Whether it's five dollars, twenty-five dollars, or a hundred dollars, every donation counts and every donation is gratefully appreciated.</p>
<h2>Donate your skills, services, or YOURSELF!</h2>
<p>In order to help raise funds, we are also putting on a fundraiser in the Denver area on November 3, and you are all invited! The fundraiser will feature a raffle of prizes from local businesses and artists and will include an auction of Denver's most eligable bachelors and bachelorettes!</p>
<p>If you are interested in taking part in one or more of the following, you can contact me through my facebook page at facebook.com/eyaanya:</p>
<ol>
<li>Donate your skills as an artist by allowing us to raffle off one of your pieces!</li>
<li>Donate your services as a handyman or mechanic for our auction!</li>
<li>Donate yourself as one of our Denver's most eligible bachelors! It's for a good cause, and will be great fun!</li>
<li>Tell your friends! Visit <a href=""http://www.fixingclyde.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.fixingclyde.com</a> for more information and for a link to our facebook page.</li>

In order to help raise funds, we are also putting on a fundraiser in the Denver area on November 3, and you are all invited! The fundraiser will feature a raffle of prizes from local businesses and artists and will include an auction of Denver's most eligable bachelors and bachelorettes!
If you are interested in taking part in one or more of the following, you can contact me through my facebook page at facebook.com/eyaanya:

Donate your skills as an artist by allowing us to raffle off one of your pieces!

Our Story


Hi! I'm Damir Docter and some of you know me as slacker animator who didn't create a thing in the past 2 years. The reason is that I am also a 3rd year student of Russian National Innovation Medical University of Pirogov (slides right of your tongue), so as the few guys from my team.
And we are about to change the very core of Medical Service. Being on the 3rd year I've seen a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes of Med Care. And it sucks! Surely there are a lot of great doctors and hospitals in every country and they can help those who really need help! But the problem is that all hospitals are pretty much divided within themselves. Oncologist never knows what Anesthesiologist is planning to do, and these guys donâ€™t know what Surgeon is up to. Plus you need to keep in the head how to maintain dozens of departments, maintenance, offices and tons of paper work!
What happens on the other side seen by the patient? Let's say you have pain in your chest somewhere near the shoulder. You come in the hospital, you wait in line, then you search for the right room, then you're being told that you need to go to the orthopedic department (and what does this word means anyway?)! Then you're doing your analyses, waiting for another 3 years and after that you're being prescribed some drugs that you should go and buy in the drugstore miles away. 
It's a mess!



Our idea is to fully control every aspect of Patient Care! Build the Ultimate Clinic. Where 3 to 5 doctors are helping them as a standard and where there are only 3 departments which even a normal human being (as opposed to the God-like doctors) can pronounce without much effort: Therapy, Family and Dentistry. How is it possible? By integrating a network system and creating new class of specialist (it's kind of a secret for now). That's it! And why does patient have to worry about some insurance numbers, papers, documents and names of the doctors? Even that problem will be resolved.

The Hospital must be a complex interlinking system and it should be maintained on its own. As a little universe. And the Patient is a center of it!

It's a long shot. But it has to be done. The Medical Care is the last fortress in the modern world that hasnâ€™t significantly changed in centuries.


It's time to push it Forward!

<h2>PROJECT BACKGROUND AND OVERVIEW:</h2>
<p>My good friend and project team member Betty Norlin and I both dealt with a condition called Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (“CFS”) in our 20’s.  We went from being energetic, optimistic and cheerful young adults to exhausted, weak, and frustrated young adults, unable to even handle routine daily chores due to our acute lack of energy.   Our schooling and careers ground to a halt.  Fortunately, with the help of family and friends, we slowly healed.     We regained our health primarily because we learned to listen to our bodies and we  experimented with approaches that seemed to accelerate our healing process.   Having been hard driving type A personalities, we slowly but surely discovered that reducing stress, eating healthier and fewer  processed foods, reducing alcohol consumption and slowly increasing exercise  were key approaches that helped us heal.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3> <img alt=""Picture of Tasty Vegetables!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/804574/pictures/full/20130511113818-VegePic1.jpg?1368297501"" src="""" style=""""/>
</h3>
<h3> SO FRUIT AND VEGGIES ARE GOOD FOR ME?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We consider ourselves very fortunate to have  conquered CFS and regained our health.   Betty and I moved forward with our lives, enjoying full careers and traveling to interesting places.  All was going well and our CFS experience was a distant memory when we suddenly hit MIDDLE AGE!  Now, I’m not saying that this was a bad thing.  On the contrary, by middle age, most people have figured out what makes them tic, and you’re still young enough to look forward to many more of life's adventures.  Middle age, however, is a time when weight, cholesterol, low energy and other heatlh issues can surface. </p>
<p>Betty and I were absolutely COMMITTED to maintaining our health and the health of our parents.   Frustration set in, however, when we  kept encountering difficulty finding answers to our health questions.  We discovered that too often, medical professionals neither had the time nor the focus to help us address the underlying causes of our health challenges.  It seemed that the preferred approach was to prescribe a pill, with another pill prescribed if the first pill's side effects were too severe, and so on and so on.  We also found it INCREDIBLY hard to keep our weight under control with one diet after another failing us.  We came to understand that our health CARE system had become more of a health SICK system, set up to TREAT diseases, but rarely focusing on PREVENTION.</p>

<h3>A NEW DIRECTION IN HEALTH THINKING:</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>FORTUNATELY, it appears that a new consciousness is starting to arise around health.  It looks like we're finally starting to enter the <strong>AGE OF PREVENTATIVE HEALTH</strong>.    It cannot come a moment too soon.  In the USA alone, nearly 32% of adults over 20 are now considered OBESE according to World Health Organization statistics.  Amazingly,  23 countries have obesity rates HIGHER than the USA!    Per the U.S. National Institutes of Health, obesity has doubled in America’s children ages 2 to 5 and TRIPLED for young people over the age of 6 in the last 30 years.    When we add to these figures those suffering from chronic pain, high cholesterol, high stress, sleep disorders, anxiety and a myriad of other issues, the magnitude of the health challenges facing us becomes clear.</p>

<h2><strong>THIS USED TO BE SO MUCH EASIER!</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This project then is alll about bringing forth the best ideas that we can find to help individuals optimize their own health.  And by this approach, we can help countless individuals PREVENT health problems from arising in the FIRST PLACE.</p>
<p>How are we going to do this?   Well, let's be very clear.  We don’t claim to have any magical solutions.   But what we do have is a PASSION about learning techniques and programs for leading healthier, happier lives and SHARING what we learn with others.  Our book project, “Champions for Health”, will help us fulfill this passion by showcasing a dynamic group of individuals who we are calling our “Champions for Health”.  These Health Champions will be unique individuals, selected from many qualified candidates, for their effective, affordable health programs and approaches.</p>
<p>How are we going to find this dynamic group of “Health Champions”?  To locate many of our Champions, we will develop a Champions for Health  web site and use it to solicit nominations of candidates from the general public.   From the list of nominees, and from our own independent research, 10 to 15 final ""Health Champions"" will be chosen.  A chapter in the Champions for Health book will be devoted to each Champion, describing not only their unique health program or approach, but also showcasing their inspirational lives and what led them to become a Champion for Health!   Medically trained professionals can certainly be among our final list of Champions, but we look forward to selecting Champions from all walks of life.</p>
<p>One of the MOST exciting aspects of this project is the potential of discovering creative, new, widely unknown or long forgotten approaches to maintaining optimal health.   Not being trained health professionals, neither Betty nor I can endorse or recommend a particular Champion’s program or approach.   And our readers should always consult their medical advisers before starting a new health program.  At the end of the project, our goal is to produce a book that not only provides concrete, easy to use approaches for achieving healthier, happier lives, but just as importantly, inspires people to achieve better health and happiness through the inspirational  lives of our Champions.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>(PSSST!  THE PROJECT HAS A LITTLE TEASER!)</h2>
<h3>While we anticipate that the book will not come out until December of this year, we plan to pre-release short ""teaser"" stories about a few of the Health Champions and their ""prescriptions"" on the Champions for Health web site on several occasions prior to the book release.  As a contributor, you will have access to these pre-releases.   Just keep checking the Champions-for-Health.com web site and be sure and give us your email so we can send you the access code and project updates!</h3>

<strong>WHAT WE NEED</strong>:  </h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Frankly, a large portion of project funds raised will be devoted to travel costs AND to providing the great rewards that we're offering to our wonderful Contributors.    We feel that we can tell the stories of our Champions much better if we are able to personally meet and interview them. Therefore, around $15,000 of the project funds will be devoted to bringing our final Champions to us or sending us out to meet with them and around an equal amount will be spent providing our rewards.      For logistical purposes, we are primarily focusing on Champion candidates located in the US and Canada.   However, we will consider Champion candidates from other countries and we are certainly open to interviewing them using Skype, email, phone etc. given that travel costs will be prohibitive for these candidates.</p>
<p>A great deal of time will be devoted to researching the Health Champion nominees that we receive.   Approximately $5,000 to $10,000 of project funds will therefore be used to compensate Betty and others to help sift through the candidates and understand better their programs and health techniques. We will need to check out testimonials for each Health Champion as well.  </p>
<p>The remaining project funds raised will go toward the cost of a web developer to  help us set up the Champion’s web site, and toward covering the production costs of the Ebook and print editions.  If we are able to raise the project funding goal, I think this all can be done.  If not, we plan to still pursue the project, but perhaps with less travel, perhaps 10 to 15 Champions instead of 15 to 20,  and more phone and Skype interviews to save travel costs.  </p>

<p><strong>WILL YOU BE MY CHAMPION?</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>OUR PERKS AND REWARDS!</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>I am REALLY excited about the perks and awards that this project offers its contributors.  Contributors at every contribution level will obtain at least a Champions for Heatlh Ebook  with signed and print copies of Champions for Health and  Betty’s book Our Bodies: The Optimal Design being important rewards as well.</p>
<p>One VERY UNIQUE reward being offered to contributors is a  Health and Nutrition Consultation(""HNC"") by Champion Jennifer Broder,  where Jennifer arranges and performs a DETAILED analysis of contributor blood tests,  obtains and reviews nutrition, diet and lifestyle information and delivers individualized lifestyle, diet and nutrition recommendations to contributors.  A HNC can really turn a person's life around.  I have personally known people who have availed themselves of Jennifer’s HNC program and they have been very happy with the results: </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>""I have referred other gastric bypass patients to her....She has been able to help every one of them"".  Katherine, satisfied client. </strong></p>
<p><strong>""The Membership gave the highest praise for your program....Your presentation was excellent and had us all diving for our pens to take notes....""  Valerie, Programs Committee Co-Chair,  MacDill Air Force Base Officers Spouses' Club, Tampa, Florida.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Let's not forget another really cool reward being offered to contibutors as well.  At the levels noted, contributors can receive ORIGINAL Champions for Health art wall pieces produced by Teresa Turner, the gifted  Champions for Health artist who produced the official Champions project image that you see below.   Each art piece will be an original 18"" by 24"" framed wall piece that you can proudly display on your wall.  </p>
<p>Of course, being listed as supporters and Bronze, Silver and Gold Champion Circle members on the project’s print, Ebook and web site are wonderful rewards in their own right as well.   I encourage you to check out the rewards and pick the level that fits you best!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE:   WHILE THE CHAMPIONS BOOK IS SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY IN DECEMBER, 2013,  JENNIFER WILL START SCHEDULING HNC'S AND TERESA TURNER WILL START PREPARING ORIGINAL ART  PIECES DURING THE MONTHS RIGHT AFTER THE PROJECT END DATE. CONTRIBUTORS CAN THEREFORE EXPECT TO RECEIVE THEIR ART WORKS AND HNC'S DURING THE JULY THROUGH OCTOBER TIME FRAME.</strong></p>
<p><strong>PLEASE ALSO NOTE:  FOR SILVER AND GOLD CHAMPION CIRCLE MEMBERS, RANDY WILL BE SCHEDULING LECTURE AND BOOK SIGNING VISITS DURING THE JANUARY THROUGH MARCH 2014 TIME PERIOD.</strong></p>

<h2><strong>THE  IMPACT</strong></h2>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Think about it.   There are approximately 250 million adults in the USA alone.   If 32% are obese-- not overweight-- but OBESE, that’s 80 million Americans who could benefit from the nutritional, exercise and weight loss ideas that this project can generate. Add to this health programs and tips addressing other health issues as well as the  millions of non-US residents confronting similar challenges, and the potential impact from this project could be big.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that we do not have a rigid,  pre-selected list of health issues that our Champions must cover.    That said, given the prevalence of weight, stress, sleep, nutrition, anxiety, and chronic pain issues, we will make a special effort to solicit and include Champions from these categories.</p>
<p>Please also keep in mind that our goal is to showcase easy to follow, easy to use and relatively inexpensive health programs and approaches.     Examples could be a simple but effective exercise program, a relatively low cost diet or an easy to use technique for reducing stress or enhancing sleep. We feel that people are often intimidated by the cost and/or complexity of many health programs and products.   Our goal with this project is to break through the intimidation and fear factor and make people comfortable with adopting the health ideas being offered by our Champions.</p>
<p>While we’ve never done a project JUST like this, Betty successfully produced her book “Our Bodies: The Optimal Design” while teaching full time and serving as a foster parent.  Betty and I produced the health web site, PitchinintheKitchen.com,  while I was taking care of aging parents, and running a busy law practice.   As a practicing attorney, I am certainly no stranger to meeting deadlines.   I feel confident that with Betty’s help, I can bring this project to fruition!</p>

NOW WE HAVE TO FIND OUR CHAMPIONS!
The Champions project team of Betty Norlin, Jennifer Broder and  yours truly Randy James, are so grateful to all of the folks that contributed to the Champions for Health project.   Thank you!  But now, the hard work begins!
As a reminder, the goal of this project is to produce a book that showcases 12-15 dynamic individuals who have developed affordable and effective health improvement programs and ideas that can be utilized by the everyman and everywoman to lead happier, HEALTHIER lives.
But first, we have to find our Champions!   While we're excited about our first Champion, Medical Nutritionist Jennifer Broder, we need help finding the rest of our Champions. 
That's where you come in.  We need you to forward us nominations of individuals that you feel should be considered for our final list of Health Champions.  Remember, the final 12 to 15 Champions that we select will have an entire chapter devoted to them in the Champions for Health ebook and print edition.  Please send us  your name and contact info,  the name and contact info of your Champion, and a short description of their health related activities or programs and why you think they should qualify as one of our final Health Champions!   Please send your nominations:
BY MESSAGING US THROUGH FACEBOOK AT:
https://www.facebook.com/pages/Champions-for-Health-by-G-Randal-James
OR BY EMAIL TO: 
ChampionsforHealth@jamesgroup.com
PLEASE REMEMBER that we'll consider Champions who have innovative and affordable health programs that address any type of health condition or challenge,  but we're especially interested in nominations of people who have programs or approaches focusing on diet, exercise, nutrition, weight, pain management, sleeplessness, anxiety and depression.  
TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE INSPIRATION FOR THIS PROJECT AND FURTHER PROJECT DETAILS, PLEASE SEE BELOW!  WE LOOK FORWARD TO RECEIVING YOUR NOMINATIONS!  :-)
 
 
PROJECT BACKGROUND AND OVERVIEW:
My good friend and project team member Betty Norlin and I both dealt with a condition called Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (“CFS”) in our 20’s.  We went from being energetic, optimistic and cheerful young adults to exhausted, weak, and frustrated young adults, unable to even handle routine daily chores due to our acute lack of energy.   Our schooling and careers ground to a halt.  Fortunately, with the help of family and friends, we slowly healed.     We regained our health primarily because we learned to listen to our bodies and we  experimented with approaches that seemed to accelerate our healing process.   Having been hard driving type A personalities, we slowly but surely discovered that reducing stress, eating healthier and fewer  processed foods, reducing alcohol consumption and slowly increasing exercise  were key approaches that helped us heal.  
 
 

 SO FRUIT AND VEGGIES ARE GOOD FOR ME?
 
We consider ourselves very fortunate to have  conquered CFS and regained our health.   Betty and I moved forward with our lives, enjoying full careers and traveling to interesting places.  All was going well and our CFS experience was a distant memory when we suddenly hit MIDDLE AGE!  Now, I’m not saying that this was a bad thing.  On the contrary, by middle age, most people have figured out what makes them tic, and you’re still young enough to look forward to many more of life's adventures.  Middle age, however, is a time when weight, cholesterol, low energy and other heatlh issues can surface. 
Betty and I were absolutely COMMITTED to maintaining our health and the health of our parents.   Frustration set in, however, when we  kept encountering difficulty finding answers to our health questions.  We discovered that too often, medical professionals neither had the time nor the focus to help us address the underlying causes of our health challenges.  It seemed that the preferred approach was to prescribe a pill, with another pill prescribed if the first pill's side effects were too severe, and so on and so on.  We also found it INCREDIBLY hard to keep our weight under control with one diet after another failing us.  We came to understand that our health CARE system had become more of a health SICK system, set up to TREAT diseases, but rarely focusing on PREVENTION.
 
 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN  MY DIET OF HOT DOGS AND BEER ISN'T NUTRITIOUS? 
 
 
A NEW DIRECTION IN HEALTH THINKING:
 
FORTUNATELY, it appears that a new consciousness is starting to arise around health.  It looks like we're finally starting to enter the AGE OF PREVENTATIVE HEALTH.    It cannot come a moment too soon.  In the USA alone, nearly 32% of adults over 20 are now considered OBESE according to World Health Organization statistics.  Amazingly,  23 countries have obesity rates HIGHER than the USA!    Per the U.S. National Institutes of Health, obesity has doubled in America’s children ages 2 to 5 and TRIPLED for young people over the age of 6 in the last 30 years.    When we add to these figures those suffering from chronic pain, high cholesterol, high stress, sleep disorders, anxiety and a myriad of other issues, the magnitude of the health challenges facing us becomes clear.
 
 
 
THIS USED TO BE SO MUCH EASIER!
 
 
This project then is alll about bringing forth the best ideas that we can find to help individuals optimize their own health.  And by this approach, we can help countless individuals PREVENT health problems from arising in the FIRST PLACE.
How are we going to do this?   Well, let's be very clear.  We don’t claim to have any magical solutions.   But what we do have is a PASSION about learning techniques and programs for leading healthier, happier lives and SHARING what we learn with others.  Our book project, “Champions for Health”, will help us fulfill this passion by showcasing a dynamic group of individuals who we are calling our “Champions for Health”.  These Health Champions will be unique individuals, selected from many qualified candidates, for their effective, affordable health programs and approaches.
How are we going to find this dynamic group of “Health Champions”?  To locate many of our Champions, we will develop a Champions for Health  web site and use it to solicit nominations of candidates from the general public.   From the list of nominees, and from our own independent research, 10 to 15 final ""Health Champions"" will be chosen.  A chapter in the Champions for Health book will be devoted to each Champion, describing not only their unique health program or approach, but also showcasing their inspirational lives and what led them to become a Champion for Health!   Medically trained professionals can certainly be among our final list of Champions, but we look forward to selecting Champions from all walks of life.
One of the MOST exciting aspects of this project is the potential of discovering creative, new, widely unknown or long forgotten approaches to maintaining optimal health.   Not being trained health professionals, neither Betty nor I can endorse or recommend a particular Champion’s program or approach.   And our readers should always consult their medical advisers before starting a new health program.  At the end of the project, our goal is to produce a book that not only provides concrete, easy to use approaches for achieving healthier, happier lives, but just as importantly, inspires people to achieve better health and happiness through the inspirational  lives of our Champions.
 
(PSSST!  THE PROJECT HAS A LITTLE TEASER!)
While we anticipate that the book will not come out until December of this year, we plan to pre-release short ""teaser"" stories about a few of the Health Champions and their ""prescriptions"" on the Champions for Health web site on several occasions prior to the book release.  As a contributor, you will have access to these pre-releases.   Just keep checking the Champions-for-Health.com web site and be sure and give us your email so we can send you the access code and project updates!
 
 

WHAT WE NEED:  
 
Frankly, a large portion of project funds raised will be devoted to travel costs AND to providing the great rewards that we're offering to our wonderful Contributors.    We feel that we can tell the stories of our Champions much better if we are able to personally meet and interview them. Therefore, around $15,000 of the project funds will be devoted to bringing our final Champions to us or sending us out to meet with them and around an equal amount will be spent providing our rewards.      For logistical purposes, we are primarily focusing on Champion candidates located in the US and Canada.   However, we will consider Champion candidates from other countries and we are certainly open to interviewing them using Skype, email, phone etc. given that travel costs will be prohibitive for these candidates.
A great deal of time will be devoted to researching the Health Champion nominees that we receive.   Approximately $5,000 to $10,000 of project funds will therefore be used to compensate Betty and others to help sift through the candidates and understand better their programs and health techniques. We will need to check out testimonials for each Health Champion as well.  
The remaining project funds raised will go toward the cost of a web developer to  help us set up the Champion’s web site, and toward covering the production costs of the Ebook and print editions.  If we are able to raise the project funding goal, I think this all can be done.  If not, we plan to still pursue the project, but perhaps with less travel, perhaps 10 to 15 Champions instead of 15 to 20,  and more phone and Skype interviews to save travel costs.  
 

WILL YOU BE MY CHAMPION?
 
 
OUR PERKS AND REWARDS!
 
I am REALLY excited about the perks and awards that this project offers its contributors.  Contributors at every contribution level will obtain at least a Champions for Heatlh Ebook  with signed and print copies of Champions for Health and  Betty’s book Our Bodies: The Optimal Design being important rewards as well.
One VERY UNIQUE reward being offered to contributors is a  Health and Nutrition Consultation(""HNC"") by Champion Jennifer Broder,  where Jennifer arranges and performs a DETAILED analysis of contributor blood tests,  obtains and reviews nutrition, diet and lifestyle information and delivers individualized lifestyle, diet and nutrition recommendations to contributors.  A HNC can really turn a person's life around.  I have personally known people who have availed themselves of Jennifer’s HNC program and they have been very happy with the results: 
 
""I have referred other gastric bypass patients to her....She has been able to help every one of them"".  Katherine, satisfied client. 
""The Membership gave the highest praise for your program....Your presentation was excellent and had us all diving for our pens to take notes....""  Valerie, Programs Committee Co-Chair,  MacDill Air Force Base Officers Spouses' Club, Tampa, Florida.
 
 
Let's not forget another really cool reward being offered to contibutors as well.  At the levels noted, contributors can receive ORIGINAL Champions for Health art wall pieces produced by Teresa Turner, the gifted  Champions for Health artist who produced the official Champions project image that you see below.   Each art piece will be an original 18"" by 24"" framed wall piece that you can proudly display on your wall.  
Of course, being listed as supporters and Bronze, Silver and Gold Champion Circle members on the project’s print, Ebook and web site are wonderful rewards in their own right as well.   I encourage you to check out the rewards and pick the level that fits you best!
 
PLEASE NOTE:   WHILE THE CHAMPIONS BOOK IS SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY IN DECEMBER, 2013,  JENNIFER WILL START SCHEDULING HNC'S AND TERESA TURNER WILL START PREPARING ORIGINAL ART  PIECES DURING THE MONTHS RIGHT AFTER THE PROJECT END DATE. CONTRIBUTORS CAN THEREFORE EXPECT TO RECEIVE THEIR ART WORKS AND HNC'S DURING THE JULY THROUGH OCTOBER TIME FRAME.
PLEASE ALSO NOTE:  FOR SILVER AND GOLD CHAMPION CIRCLE MEMBERS, RANDY WILL BE SCHEDULING LECTURE AND BOOK SIGNING VISITS DURING THE JANUARY THROUGH MARCH 2014 TIME PERIOD.
 
THE  IMPACT
 
Think about it.   There are approximately 250 million adults in the USA alone.   If 32% are obese-- not overweight-- but OBESE, that’s 80 million Americans who could benefit from the nutritional, exercise and weight loss ideas that this project can generate. Add to this health programs and tips addressing other health issues as well as the  millions of non-US residents confronting similar challenges, and the potential impact from this project could be big.
Keep in mind that we do not have a rigid,  pre-selected list of health issues that our Champions must cover.    That said, given the prevalence of weight, stress, sleep, nutrition, anxiety, and chronic pain issues, we will make a special effort to solicit and include Champions from these categories.
Please also keep in mind that our goal is to showcase easy to follow, easy to use and relatively inexpensive health programs and approaches.     Examples could be a simple but effective exercise program, a relatively low cost diet or an easy to use technique for reducing stress or enhancing sleep. We feel that people are often intimidated by the cost and/or complexity of many health programs and products.   Our goal with this project is to break through the intimidation and fear factor and make people comfortable with adopting the health ideas being offered by our Champions.
While we’ve never done a project JUST like this, Betty successfully produced her book “Our Bodies: The Optimal Design” while teaching full time and serving as a foster parent.  Betty and I produced the health web site, PitchinintheKitchen.com,  while I was taking care of aging parents, and running a busy law practice.   As a practicing attorney, I am certainly no stranger to meeting deadlines.   I feel confident that with Betty’s help, I can bring this project to fruition!

I am so excited to share my project with you! I traveled throughout the U.S. by car, interviewing and photographing women in their 70’s, 80’s and 90’s at the beauty parlor. My goal is to widen the perception of beauty in a culture that is primarily focused on the beauty of youth. My intention is for my images to evoke a new view on aging, to shed light on this almost forgotten generation and to preserve the ritual and technique and the history that these women have contributed so greatly to. These women are our mothers and grandmothers and I would like to make them visible.</p>
<p>I would be so delighted to have your participation in the completion of my work for the documentary, exhibit and book. I am planning to take additional video and photographs. Some cities and states that I have already photographed women in are: Memphis, California, New Orleans, Alabama, Santa Fe and Baton Rouge.</p>
<p>Your participation and funding provides me the opportunity to submit “Beauty &amp; Wisdom” to contests and reviews so it can be presented to reviewers and curators for galleries and exhibits. There are two reviews that will cost at least $4000.00 in total. This includes travel and lodging to where the review is in Portland, OR. The other is in Los Angeles and the cost of 1 review is $100.00 per session. I would like to have at least 5 sessions, 5 chances to get my work in front of people who can represent my project and share it with many. Your support will help me get closer to exhibiting this work that I believe in with all my heart. I appreciate any participation and feel free to send me your stories of your mother or grandmother at the beauty parlor and I just might post it on my blog!</p>
<p>This year I turned 50 and started thinking about the aging process and my options for how I will view the future.  As I photographed these fearless women and heard their stories about life, I was inspired and realized that I can look forward to getting older and so can you. This fading generation of women will not be around forever and it is important to recognize their contribution as they paved the way for all of us and to honor their beauty and wisdom that they have earned and are so willing to share.</p>
<p>Perks for the donations will include public thank you(s) on my Beauty &amp; Wisdom blog, Personalized music CD from the Robbie Kaye Band, original photo thank you card, set of handmade cards with signed original prints, signed and matted prints, special thank yous listed in the documentary and book… and a personal portrait (depending on location-this includes your mom or grandmother (70 or over) at the beauty parlor and their possible inclusion in my book, exhibit or documentary).</p>

The event changed my life. My father had died suddenly at age 40, when I was 12 years old. These two events shook me. As I recovered, I grew to see an undiscovered world that lay beyond the golf course. I came to a new appreciation of every day, seeing the good in the people I met, embracing the rich diversity of beliefs and experiences that exist around the world. Rather than just be about winning, I became about living.<p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/427594/files/20140311210530-Finding_title.jpg?1394597130"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>Strokes usually cause brain damage. For me it was my left hemisphere (which controls the right side of the body, language and speech). I had to literally re-learn so many things that were once routine. <br/><br/>As I started to get feeling back in my right side, still many simple tasks like typing were nearly impossible. I was stumbling in my speech. This was obviously an extremely frustrating time. I was reteaching myself all basic movement. I would move all day until exhaustion for months on end relearning some functions I had taken for granted. A friend gave me a book on Tedy Bruschi, the Patriots linebacker who would return to football after he had gone through a similar incident. This provided great inspiration to know that I could come back. I became fascinated with how the brain and body works, and human potential.<br/><br/><b>I was determined to get back to golf. </b> Six months after having a stroke I qualified for the Shell Houston Open on the PGA Tour. That same summer in 2008 I would tie for firsts before losing in a playoff on the Canadian Tour. I posted another 2nd place a few months later. In 2009, I qualified for and briefly led the U.S. Open after a rain-delayed first day. In 2012, I competed in several European Tour events and played in the final grouping on Sunday in Sicily, where I would finish 6th.  In the Joburg Open I played in the second to last group on Sunday to finish 13th in my European Tour debut.  In 2013, I qualified and played on PGA Latinoamerica.

I won my first top amateur prize in 2004, I was medalist at the Canadian Amateur, top-10 at the US and British Amateurs, and I competed collegiately as an All-American and All-Big 12 with Texas A&M University (2002-2006). In 2007, I turned pro and won my first-ever pro tournament on the Gateway Tour. Then something happened that changed my life....I had a stroke.I was only 24 and in what I thought was great health, yet I had a stroke. The event changed my life. My father had died suddenly at age 40, when I was 12 years old. These two events shook me. As I recovered, I grew to see an undiscovered world that lay beyond the golf course. I came to a new appreciation of every day, seeing the good in the people I met, embracing the rich diversity of beliefs and experiences that exist around the world. Rather than just be about winning, I became about living.Strokes usually cause brain damage. For me it was my left hemisphere (which controls the right side of the body, language and speech). I had to literally re-learn so many things that were once routine. As I started to get feeling back in my right side, still many simple tasks like typing were nearly impossible. I was stumbling in my speech. This was obviously an extremely frustrating time. I was reteaching myself all basic movement. I would move all day until exhaustion for months on end relearning some functions I had taken for granted. A friend gave me a book on Tedy Bruschi, the Patriots linebacker who would return to football after he had gone through a similar incident. This provided great inspiration to know that I could come back. I became fascinated with how the brain and body works, and human potential.I was determined to get back to golf.  Six months after having a stroke I qualified for the Shell Houston Open on the PGA Tour. That same summer in 2008 I would tie for firsts before losing in a playoff on the Canadian Tour. I posted another 2nd place a few months later. In 2009, I qualified for and briefly led the U.S. Open after a rain-delayed first day. In 2012, I competed in several European Tour events and played in the final grouping on Sunday in Sicily, where I would finish 6th.  In the Joburg Open I played in the second to last group on Sunday to finish 13th in my European Tour debut.  In 2013, I qualified and played on PGA Latinoamerica. The following are tours and tournaments in which I have competed in: In the years following the stroke, I traveled around the world, 
questioned my beliefs and my path, experimented with connections between
 good health, diet, and nutrition, met many amazing people and learned 
about their journeys. All the while, I’ve been trying out new approaches to the game of golf. I’ve been finding connections between the way I’ve changed as a person with the way I need to play on the golf course to win at the highest levels.  I’ve come close many times and am now poised for a major breakthrough for my career. Through it all, I have come to fully understand something about myself.

He does not deserve what has happened to him. <br/></p><p>On November 12th 2013, the day before his 23rd birthday, Tyler found out he has an aggressive form of bone marrow cancer. Ewing sarcoma is the name of the affliction. It is a very rare form of cancer and is usually not found in adults. After days of rigorous testing, it was found inhabiting his left and right hips, cervical spine, spinal cord, chest, right shoulder, ribs, and liver. <br/></p><p>It is believed that this disease has been spreading through his body for around 2 years, but was misdiagnosed as  sciatica.
 So, for the last two years his pain has been growing along with the 
cancer. He felt helpless to it, but did his best to push through day-to-day life acting
 like nothing was wrong. <br/></p><p>On Friday, November 22nd, Tyler began his first round of chemotherapy. He will continue to get chemo on a bi-weekly schedule (one treatment every two weeks) until further notice. In between these major treatments he will need to be medicated with various drugs for pain, nausea, etc.  </p><p>Since the day of his diagnosis, Tyler has spent most of his time inside a hospital and hospitals are expensive! The medical debt accrued from an illness such as this is simply unfathomable. He has minimal health insurance, which isn't going to cover much at all, and no savings to support him through this. He needs our help! The ONLY thing he should be thinking about right now is getting better. <br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3></h3><h3>The Impact</h3><p>Every penny earned here will go to help pay Tyler's medical bills. Chemotherapy, medications, blood tests, MRI's, x-rays, a hospital bed for his home, radiation therapy, hospital stays... that is what your money will buy for a truly deserving person.</p><p>Donate and join Team Tyler! Let's ease the financial burden from him so he can focus on what is really important.<br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><ul>
<li>If you can't contribute financially spread the word! The more people who know Tyler's story the better!<br/>

<li>Use the Indiegogo share tools!</li>
<li>Keep Tyler in your thoughts and prayers.</li>

 like nothing was wrong. On Friday, November 22nd, Tyler began his first round of chemotherapy. He will continue to get chemo on a bi-weekly schedule (one treatment every two weeks) until further notice. In between these major treatments he will need to be medicated with various drugs for pain, nausea, etc.  Since the day of his diagnosis, Tyler has spent most of his time inside a hospital and hospitals are expensive! The medical debt accrued from an illness such as this is simply unfathomable. He has minimal health insurance, which isn't going to cover much at all, and no savings to support him through this. He needs our help! The ONLY thing he should be thinking about right now is getting better. The ImpactEvery penny earned here will go to help pay Tyler's medical bills. Chemotherapy, medications, blood tests, MRI's, x-rays, a hospital bed for his home, radiation therapy, hospital stays... that is what your money will buy for a truly deserving person.Donate and join Team Tyler! Let's ease the financial burden from him so he can focus on what is really important.Other Ways You Can Help

<p>Whether it’s Cancer or Diabetes, Friedreichs Ataxia or Asthma, Thyroid complications or MS, we all know somebody whose life has been drastically impacted or altered due to a disease or disorder. Some people have inspired us to live every day to the fullest extent possible, and others have unfortunately let their circumstances get the best of them. No matter who you are or what you’re up against, everybody wrestles with hopelessness at times. With the help of our contributors and the mission of de:terminence, we are setting out to<em> inspire</em> hope, <em>create</em> hope, and to show the world that a more fulfilled and engaged life can be lived NOW, no matter the circumstances.</p>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">INTRODUCTION</span></h3>
<p>My name is Sean Baumstark and in 2007 I was diagnosed with a debilitating disease called Friedreich’s Ataxia (FA). FA is a rare, degenerative, neuromuscular disease that causes progressive damage to the central nervous system, threatening to put me in a wheelchair and cause an array of other issues including loss of vision, fatigue,  scoliosis of the spine, slurred speech, diabetes, and ending life much too early due to heart disease. Since my diagnosis I’ve run a half marathon, competed on a 12-man relay team running 178 miles in 32 hours, hiked several mountain peaks, pedaled my bicycle from Sacramento CA to Las Vegas NV, competed on a 4-man team in Race Across America (cycling 3,012 miles from coast to coast), and carried the Olympic Torch during the 2008 Olympic Torch Relay.</p>
<p>When I realized that my ability to walk, run, or really get around on my own will eventually go away, I was immediately determined to do what I can, while I can, because I can! I refuse to let my circumstances dictate or govern my everyday life – and I hope to inspire other people to live beyond their own circumstances no matter what disease or disorder they are up against. Beyond inspiring them, I want to help people accomplish their own physically challenging adventures for the sake of awareness, health, and life. </p>
<h3>THE MAGNITUDE OF YOUR CONTRIBUTION</h3>
<p>We believe de:terminence can and has the ability to impact the lives of thousands all over the world as we build, launch, and grow. de:terminence is not about Sean or Friedreichs Ataxia. Instead, it’s completely about inspiring, enabling, and assisting others to live a more fulfilled life in the midst of whatever disease or disorder they are up against. Although important, we aren’t setting out to directly fund research or cures…We are on a mission to help those in need of a cure live a more fulfilled life NOW. Hopelessness and a life lived on the sidelines are our enemies.</p>
<p>You will be helping build de:terminence from the ground up. First things first, de:terminence needs to file for 501(c)3 status (non-profit), write our bylaws, put a board in place, and lay all the basic bricks necessary for an organization to legally operate and do so for decades to come. We are not organizing an event, or just looking to influence our neighborhood. Instead, we are facilitating a way of life for people all over the world.</p>
<p>We are looking for people like you to be a part from the very beginning.</p>
<p>We have vision. We have passion. We have courage. We have ambition. We have creativity. We have great talent and advisors behind de:terminence. What we need is a jump start on our startup capital.</p>
<div>
<h3>WHAT WE NEED &amp; WHAT YOU GET</h3>
<p>At the very least, we have launched this campaign to enable us to file what is necessary to legally start the organization – from filling for 501(c)3 status with legal help, pay state and federal fees attached to filing, state and federal fees required to start a business, to drafting our bylaws and furthering our launch promotions.</p>
<p>Also, we’ve assembled a team of 12 to compete in the Reno-Tahoe Odyssey, May 31-June 1, in order to raise awareness of de:terminence and promote this campaign. The Reno-Tahoe Odyssey is a 178-mile relay run beginning in Reno, NV running south around the west side of Lake Tahoe and back to Reno via the east side of the lake, non-stop over the course of 30 hours. Some funds raised in addition to startup costs will be used to send our team with all necessary equipment and enhance the team’s promotional efforts and its brand presence during the race (i.e. appropriate gear, supplies, vehicle magnets, etc.). Participation in the Reno-Tahoe Odyssey 2013 is Team de:terminence’s inaugural launch event.</p>
<p>Beyond filing the start of a business, applying for 501(c)3 status, tying up loose ends for the “team de:terminence” relay in the Reno-Tahoe Odyssey, any additional funding will be used toward the design and development of the de:terminence website and the design and implementation of a pilot program for 3-5 individuals in the United States.</p>
<p><strong>No matter what is raised from this campaign, those behind this launch are committed to being transparent with the use of our funds and allowing others to view and advise on the management and expenditure of funds in order to foster strong financial practices, sound use of funds, and allow for accountability.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>WHAT HAPPENS IF WE DON'T HIT OUR GOAL?</strong></h3>
All funds will be used to help legally and formally establish and launch de:terminence as a non-profit organization and will advance the vision and passion of its decision-makers to impact the world. The funds raised or lack thereof will not determine the existence of de:terminence, it will however impact the degree and speed at which things develop.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>THE IMPACT</h3>
<p>Many sources tell us that there are over 7,000 rare and orphaned diseases in our world today. Of those diseases, an estimated 30 million Americans are affected and more than ten times that are affected around the globe. Somewhere between 75 and 85% of those diseases are caused by damaged genes. (That “7,000” does not include the more “common” diseases).</p>
<p>Hundreds of organizations, researchers, and doctors are working feverishly to treat, cure, and eradicate some of those diseases. In the meantime, those of us waiting (hoping) for a cure are trying to find ways to live more fulfilled lives - despite disease, disorders, disabilities, and limited financial resource to support the necessities of life AND manage health to the degree that is necessary. (No matter what age, social security and/or disability aid is, in most cases, laughable).</p>
<h3>SOME HISTORY</h3>
<p>Sean has been able to participate in and accomplish several amazing feats considering his disease. He’s also been given many opportunities to travel and share his story and the vision behind de:terminence, over the last couple years, inspiring hundreds of people to take an interest in the vision and mission of de:terminence. Now it’s time to move people into action in order to inspire and enable others living with a disease or disorder that jeopardizes their quality of life, or life itself.</p>

I'm about half way through a masters degree in Somatic Counseling Psychology, and I am passionate about embodiment, and developing resources within the body.</p>
<p>For the next stage of my journey, I would like to enroll in a 3 year Somatic Experiencing training, to give me the skills to work with individuals dealing with trauma. Please help me to fund the first of this 3 year training!<br/></p>
<h3>Somatic Experiencing<br/>
</h3>
<p>Somatic Experiencing is a somatic therapeutic modality developed by Dr. Peter Levine. He based it upon the realization that humans, like all animals, have an innate capacity to overcome the effects of trauma. Our bodies contain a profound capacity for resilience and self-regulation. <br/></p>
<p>Animals in the wild experience instances of traumatic stress on a daily basis, yet continue on every day with the full range of their physical and emotional resources.</p>
<p>Humans, however, seem to now live lives that do not allow for a natural discharge of the energy accumulated in the body by experiences of trauma. When the body perceives a threat to itself, the pre-reptilian brain mobilizes huge amounts of energy, and floods the limbs with it, giving it a set of instructions for how to avoid danger. These instructions need to be fully carried out in order for the energy to be discharged. It is when we do not carry out these instructions for safety, or our bodies are not given given the time, space and containment to fully discharge that this energy gets stuck and leads to issues like PTSD, chronic pain and anxiety.</p>
<p>Somatic Experiencing is a type of therapy that works to release these blockages from the body by utilizing our natural abilities for resilience. <br/></p>
<p>
The first rule of any therapy is always safety. A client and therapist
must build a rapport before healing work can be done. A somatic therapist, especially one practicing SE, must also
be very attuned with the signals coming from their own body, and those of their
client. They must be able to tell
my looking at and listening to someone if their nervous system in a socially
engaged state, hyper aroused with fear or anger, or immobilized with trauma.
This recognition will help them guide their client along their journey, making sure the charge is manageable, and the client does not become re-traumatized or frozen. Recognizing these signs requires a great deal of self-work
and training. </p>
<p>Therapist and client go on a journey together, this begins by the therapist promoting safe exploration of the body. For many traumatized people, the body does not feel like a safe place. A therapist will help a client focus in on specifically what feels good in the body, what feels joyous and expansive. Once these resources are found they can be expanded, becoming just as big as the trauma. The client can move between these good sensations, and the sensations of trauma and anxiety, taking in a little bit of each at a time. This demonstrates to the client that they have choice, that they are not a victim of the frightening sensations in the body.</p>
<p>This act of switching between sensations is called pendulation. Pendulation creates a rhythm, which helps the body become unstuck. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Slowly, over time, client and therapist can tap into the sensations arising from the muscles, and follow them as they turn into gestures, movements and emotions. With guidance from a therapist, a client can allow these movements to play themselves out, old instructions are able to play themselves out to completion, and stuck energy can finally be discharged, a little at a time.<br/></p>With every little bit of energy discharged, we have a little piece of ourselves back. More of us is in the present, no longer stuck in the past, looking to repeat past traumas for reasons we can't understand.<p>
Underneath defeated and collapsed muscles remain the active responses
that were ready to protect us. 

The body learns it not a helpless victim!</p>

<h3>Hi, my name is Nancy Mobley and I am raising money for the seniors we have rescued from abuse and neglect. My partner, Burt Nydahl and I own and have operated Oceanview Retirement since 1999. Most of the seniors that are in our care have been neglected or abused by either their families or the system or both.</h3>
<h3>These seniors have diminished mental and or physical capabilities but the health care system has determined they are ""not yet ready"" to be moved into a ""facility"", so they try to survive on very limited incomes while falling deeper through the widening cracks in the system. This is their shocking story.</h3>
<p align=""left"">Six years ago a home support worker told us about a man living in a small trailer in our town. The worker told us the man didn't know where his family was and he was living on a small $900 a month pension. The trailer was all he could afford.</p>
<p align=""left""> That day she was particularity concerned because it was snowing. My partner and I found him inside, huddled by his heater. The front of the trailer had a large gap in the siding and you could actually see the ground outside. We could see his breath when he spoke. We invited him to come with us to Oceanview and have lunch. He stayed with us for two years and he was the first of about 20 seniors we have since rescued.</p>
<p align=""left""> Another living in a 100 bed senior complex called to tell me she was being ""kicked out"". I asked our handyman and his 20 year old helper to come with me to collect her and her belongings. When we got to her room, it required both guys to push the junk out of the way of the door before we could get inside.</p>
<p align=""left"">When we did get the door open, the smell of urine was overpowering. There was so much debris everywhere you couldn’t see the floor. The bathroom was a total mess, with pills and even used toilet paper on the floor. We had to leave her belongings behind because the complex had a bed bug infestation.</p>
<p align=""left"">The first thing we did was to put her in the bath to check for the nasty beasts. While she was relaxing in the warm water, with tears in her eyes, she told the care aide that ""this was the first bath she had in ages"".  I called her family to tell them she was staying with us. Her daughter told me she had tried to get her mom to clean the apartment but she would get angry, so she was left to live in filth and squalor. She has been with us now for two years and has brought us all so much love and joy.</p>
<p align=""left""> Another man had moved in with his daughter-in-law after his son died. Within two years the daughter-in-law had spent all his money and then literally dumped him on our door step. She said that she just couldn't put up with him anymore. He is the most quiet, polite man I know.</p>
<p align=""left""> Oceanview provides volunteers to take these people to doctors, dentists and even the ER when families can't or won't and of course we pay for the gas. We buy diabetics special foods so they can eat desserts like the other folks. We buy toothpaste and soaps, haircuts and even disposable undergarments for the incontinent.. On one occasion we even bought an entire wardrobe when the lady had to leave all her infested clothes behind. We bring in entertainers to visit. All these things cost money which we don't receive from our residents, but it is these very things that give our seniors back their dignity.</p>
<p align=""left"">Oceanview was managing to get by until this last year. when our property taxes were vastly increased. With the rising cost of doing business, we are now struggling. Our bank has been great but we are coming up short each month. We will not close our doors- that's the promise we made to our residents and to God a long time ago.</p>
<p align=""left"">If you are not in a position to help financially, please let your friends and networks know about our work. Perhaps they can help.</p>
<p align=""left""> </p>
<p align=""left"">OUR TRACK RECORD</p>
<p align=""left"">A few years ago, Oceanview was involved in a study of nursing homes specializing in dementia in British Columbia by a student from Bath England getting her Masters. <a href=""http://www.oceanviewretirement.com/retirement_living_resources_assistance.html."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Read her full report on our website.</a>She determined that Oceanview should be the model for all nursing homes for people living with dementia in Canada. She said that we were the most home like she had ever seen.</p>
<p align=""left"">She was delighted that we tell each resident that this is their home and they can have visitors whenever they want. They can invite friends and family to dinner whenever they want and they can hang pictures on the walls and stay up till they want to go to bed. They even get up when they want to get up in the morning.</p>
<p align=""left"">When people first walk into Oceanview, they don't realize that it is a nursing home. There are no rules and regulations posted on the walls, only art. There are no names posted by each bedroom. Everyone sits at one big long table for all meals and the staff eat with them just like at home.</p>
<p align=""left"">We encourage families to drop in anytime and if it's meal or tea time, they eat with us. We celebrate individual birthdays, just like at home. The only thing we do have in common with institutions is that each bedroom has a number in case of an emergency.</p>
<p align=""left"">WHERE THE MONIES WILL BE SPENT</p>
<p align=""left"">The monies we receive will fund some of the necessities of life that we take for granted such as the toothpaste and soap I talked about earlier. We will be able to hire a part time coordinator to ensure our residents have both sensory and mental stimulation on an ongoing basis rather than a once monthly visit by a volunteer.</p>
<p align=""left"">We will be able to buy clothing or a new pair of eye glasses, even make sure a dentist sees our residents at least once a year. We will finally be able to start the long planned for vegetable garden built closer to the house for our not so able gardeners to tend. We will be able to consult a dietitian to make sure our residents receive the proper nutrition.</p>
<p align=""left""> Our commercial dishwasher is held together with prayers so if there is any extra that would be a bonus! Even our repair man would thank you!</p>

We will be able to buy clothing or a new pair of eye glasses, even make sure a dentist sees our residents at least once a year. We will finally be able to start the long planned for vegetable garden built closer to the house for our not so able gardeners to tend. We will be able to consult a dietitian to make sure our residents receive the proper nutrition.
 Our commercial dishwasher is held together with prayers so if there is any extra that would be a bonus! Even our repair man would thank you!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>I'm Christopher Bell, and this is the story of one of the greatest men in my life, my step-father, Daniel Gonzalez.</h3>
<p>Danny was diagnosed in September 2012 with Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma, a type of Throat and Sinus Cancer. This diagnoses has hit our family like a freight train. So many thoughts and emotions have run wildly through our heads, thoughts of ""What is going to happen to Dad?"", ""How could this happen? He's never smoked a cigarette in his life, and he doesn't drink alcohol."" to ""How in the world are we going to pay for our medical expenses??"". Danny's doctor, Dr. Katz and Dr. V has said that this is a curable form of cancer. They said that it reacts very well to Radiation Treatment.</p>
<p><br/>I started this campaign to try and help with our costs for his medical bills. Even though he has medical insurance, our co-pays and out of pocket expenses are going to be astronomical! Everything from his Radiation treatment, Chemotherapy, CT Scans, Prescriptions, and anything over-the-counter that he is going to need.</p>
<p>Our family has banded together and started to pool all of our money to help with these costs, but we all know that it won't be enough to cover everything.</p>
<p>Let me give you a little background on Danny. He was born in New York City in 1964 and grew up in the Bronx. He is the son of Audrey and Nelson Gonzalez, both moved here from Puerto Rico. When Danny graduated high school, he enlisted in The Air Force where he served as an Air Traffic Controller for 10 years as Active Military. After a decade of service he went into The Air National Guard. He was stationed at Vance Air Force Base where he met his first wife, and the mother of his 3 children, Austin, Jordan, and Kelsey. Unfortunately Danny and his first wife went their separate ways and Danny was re-located to Biloxi, Mississippi where he met his second wife, Dawn and her 3 children, Christopher, Michelle, and Joshua. After 20 years of Active and Reserve duty, Danny was Honorably Discharged from the Air Force. Since his discharge, he has started working as a restaurant manager at Cheddar's Casual Cafe. Dan is very passionate about his work.</p>
<p>Danny is a God fearing, dedicated father to his children and step-children, and a loving and faithful husband. Danny has always looked at his step-children as if they were his own.</p>
<p><strong>What we need. </strong></p>
<p>We are looking to raise anywhere from $3000 to $5000 (if we raise more, that's fantastic!) for Danny's medical expenses. Now I know what you are thinking, how is $3000-$5000 going to pay for all of his medical bills?? The answer is, it's not. We are not looking for all of his bills to be paid for by contributors, we are just looking for some help, something to ""Cushion"" us if you will. That way we can still put food on the table, pay our rent, pay our electric bill. Something to help ease us financially. I know that times are hard right now for a lot of people. And to be honest, we really can not afford this by ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>Where will your contributions go?</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong>I will be setting up a savings account for the contributions. 100% of the contributions will be going to Danny's medical bills, Doctor visits, CT Scans, Biopsies, Radiation treatment, Chemo Therapy, Prescriptions, Over-The-Counter Medications, and any Hospital stays. </p>
<p>Whether we reach our $3000 goal or not, 100% will go to his medical expenses.</p>
<p>Whether you can donate $1 or $1000, any little bit of help will not go unnoticed and is very gratefully accepted. And we warmly thank you for anything that you can spare!</p>
<p><strong>Can't help financially but still want to help? </strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong>I understand that these times are hard for a lot of families out there, and even if you can't help financially but still want to help, I ask that you please share this story with other people. I want the world to see what a great man my step-father, Danny, really is. This man has given his family everything he has. He has given the shirt off his back, the last dollar out of his wallet just to help other people. This man is full of love and happiness. Meet the man once, and he will leave a very memorable, life-lasting memory with you. </p>
<p><br/>In closing, I want to reach out to everyone reading this and say thank you, from the bottom of my heart. Any form of help that you can give to our family is very appreciated. Cancer is a very tough thing to deal with, and I would never wish it on anyone. But if we can all come together and share our resources, we can beat this demon known as cancer!</p>

<h2>Seniors Should be Gardening, too!</h2>
<p>Sage Gardeners, a federally registered 501(c)3 non-profit organization was founded in 2010 by master gardener Jonquil Nelson. Raised on an Indiana farm and a granddaughter to a man that lived for tilling the spring earth and salting his sun-kissed tomatoes, Jonquil realized that she needed to give gardens back to the many seniors that once put their hands through the soil. Many grand and wonderful organizations focus on <em>farm to school</em> and <em>farm to table</em>, but Jonquil couldn’t find one in Montana that focused on reconnecting seniors to their gardening roots.</p>
<p>Sage Gardeners provides accessible, raised organic vegetable gardens to disadvantaged seniors in both senior retirement communities and private residences in Montana. Our goals as an organization are simple: provide gardening to disadvantages seniors as an opportunity to enhance their quality of life. Some benefits for seniors who garden: improvement in nutrition by eating fresh, clean vegetables, reducing isolation with social interaction with volunteers, neighbors, and other community members, increase in mental stimulation, and improvement in mobility and flexibility by increasing physical exercise.</p>

<h2>What it Takes to get a Senior Outside and Gardening - Not Much!</h2>
<p>Sage Gardeners focuses primarily on two program areas: retirement communities and private residences. Not only do we build, fill, and assist in planting, but we aide in maintaining these gardens indefinitely. Our goal is to get elderly seniors independently gardening; though we modify each garden and assistance to the senior’s ability. We serve elderly, aging, seniors with low- moderate income; veteran seniors, minority seniors; and disabled seniors; we do not discriminate. We offer our services to any senior that wants our help and shows a need. </p>
<p>2012 was met with much success that we have a waiting list for this year’s garden recipients. We have three retirement communities that need our help and several private residences on a wait list, just for 2013 alone. We need your support to get the garden built!</p>
<p>Any funding received goes straight into Sage Gardeners senior gardening program to help build gardens for seniors. Funds will be used for program support, greenhouse support, materials for building and constructing accessible pathways and gardens (lumber, hardware, or old feeding tanks/troughs); gravel; fill: organic garden soil and compost, mulch; organic starts (small vegetable plants) and seeds, purchasing small hand tools, gloves, hoses, sprayers, and if needed sun shades or trees for the retirement communities. We will also use funding for additional supplies that seniors may find useful and helpful while gardening. We will continue to build gardens as funding is received even as late as September or October… that just means an earlier start for next spring to plant peas, carrots, and greens!</p>

I'm a spiritual teacher and an intuitive guide who offers healing messages from spirit guides through intuitive readings. I've always wanted to go further, and offer relief to people who are struggling with physical issues, but never had the tools. I struggled for many years with debilitating chronic conditions of my own, which inspired me to keep looking for answers. I finally found a brilliant healing system that I've used on my friends, family, and clients, and it's a dream come true. </p>
<p>I'm launching this campaign to raise the funds to get certified as an official ""Body Code"" practitioner. The body code is a comprehensive healing system that is already working wonders on my own health and the health of my loved ones.</p>
<p>If you contribute to this campaign, it will allow me to work with my clients in a new and exciting way, and take my intuitive practice to a higher level.</p>
<p>Body code certification is two-fold. First, I'd need to get certified as an Emotion Code practitioner, which costs $697. After that, I'd be eligible to apply for certification as a Body Code practitioner, which costs $1,297. Anything I collect from this site is going to this goal.  </p>
<p>For too long, I've watched my clients and family members suffer with health issues. For the first time in my life, I feel like I finally have something to offer them. The body code system allows me to connect with anyone who wants healing, and create a connection with their subconscious mind. The subconscious mind has all the answers, and it knows what imbalances are causing the symptoms. The best part, is that the body code system has a way to release those imbalances right then and there, without needing the client to be present physically or on the phone. </p>
<p>I have already seen massive results with this, and it's so encouraging. I don't want people to suffer if they don't need to. Whether someone is coming down with a virus, or dealing with chronic back pain, this system can help. I just received this testimonial from someone I worked on yesterday.</p>
<p>

</div></div>","Short Summary My name is Jessica McKay and I'm passionate about healing! I'm a spiritual teacher and an intuitive guide who offers healing messages from spirit guides through intuitive readings. I've always wanted to go further, and offer relief to people who are struggling with physical issues, but never had the tools. I struggled for many years with debilitating chronic conditions of my own, which inspired me to keep looking for answers. I finally found a brilliant healing system that I've used on my friends, family, and clients, and it's a dream come true. 
I'm launching this campaign to raise the funds to get certified as an official ""Body Code"" practitioner. The body code is a comprehensive healing system that is already working wonders on my own health and the health of my loved ones.
If you contribute to this campaign, it will allow me to work with my clients in a new and exciting way, and take my intuitive practice to a higher level.
Body code certification is two-fold. First, I'd need to get certified as an Emotion Code practitioner, which costs $697. After that, I'd be eligible to apply for certification as a Body Code practitioner, which costs $1,297. Anything I collect from this site is going to this goal.  
For too long, I've watched my clients and family members suffer with health issues. For the first time in my life, I feel like I finally have something to offer them. The body code system allows me to connect with anyone who wants healing, and create a connection with their subconscious mind. The subconscious mind has all the answers, and it knows what imbalances are causing the symptoms. The best part, is that the body code system has a way to release those imbalances right then and there, without needing the client to be present physically or on the phone. 
I have already seen massive results with this, and it's so encouraging. I don't want people to suffer if they don't need to. Whether someone is coming down with a virus, or dealing with chronic back pain, this system can help. I just received this testimonial from someone I worked on yesterday.

<h2>Why qFoods?</h2>
<p>All the science is embedded in this app.  Actual fact-based science, research, and development on the latest in the field of nutrition.  We routinely update our algorithms and methods to best serve our customers.</p>
<p>qFoods allows you to eat the foods you like. We all know quick fixes and fads do not work.  This is well-established and can seem unfortunately daunting as dieting is hard and daunting.  Also, healthy eating is more effective if food and meal suggestions align with people's personal preferences.</p>
<p>Millennials eating habits are not good... research is showing that millennials diets are worse than older generations, meaning that overweight and obesity, and the physical and health issues that come with it, will not be far behind.</p>
<p>but food consumptions applications aren't geared for this generation.  Millennials do appreciate quality foods, a quality corporate culture, and do want to contribute to the general well-being of the environment.</p>
<p>qFoods targets the tech savvy customers with an easy solution for people to get tailored meal suggestions with a tap of a button that can ensure healthier eating.</p>
<p>Whether you’re tired of the daily food rut and looking for better meal choices, trying to impress your date or significant other, or figure out some new healthy meals to make for your kids, qFoods ensures you’ll get the best selections possible.</p>
<h2>What the app does</h2>
<h3>Initial setup</h3>
<p>Like any application, we need to know a little bit about what you like to eat.  Some set up is required, but some is optional.  Eventually, the system will learn what you like anyway, but the more you tell us, the faster that gets.</p>
<p>At minimum, all you need to do is...</p>
<p>Download the app (Google Play and App Store from Apple)</p>
<p>Pick cuisines you like (Italian, Greek, American, Mexican...etc.)</p>
<p>Optionally, if you want to fill out more information on foods you eat, we can help guide you even further.  And hey, for your efforts, we'll score your current diet so you can see how you improve right from day 1.</p>
<p>We'll be in the app stores, so we won't be collecting any financial information or any personal information from you.  You've already given that to Apple or Google, we don't need it.  We just need to know what you eat.</p>
<h3>Daily use</h3>
<p>Once the simple set up is done, all you need to do is....</p>
<p>Tap a button for meal suggestions.</p>
<p>If you like the suggested meal, eat it! If you don’t, swipe left on the food and see another option. </p>
<p>Once you’re done, tell the app if you ate the food.</p>
<p>It's that simple!</p>
<p>The application uses the qCal methodology to rate the quality of foods eaten, and we will track changes to your dietary diversity and healthy eating over time</p>
<h3>Tracking progress</h3>
<p>You can track your progress over time, seeing how your diet quality and diversity changes.  Set weekly goals and alerts to ensure you get what you need.  </p>
<h3>Community challenges</h3>
<p>We will build functionality for many communities, starting with:</p>
<p><strong>qConsumer Community</strong></p>
<p>Challenge your friends to win contests.  We all love wining fitness challenges, and now we can win these challenges too.   </p>
<p><strong>qContributor Community</strong></p>
<p>Contribute to a community of food recipes to unlock special app features and deals. Do you think you have a recipe that the world will love?  Prove it!  If your recipe gets attention, so will you.  You'll not only be featured on our newsletter and web site, but you will get great prizes and unlock special features that only our super contributors can access.</p>
<h2>Risks and challenges</h2>
<p>The main risk of any new idea is whether or not there is a market, and then the subsequent challenge of how to most effectively engage that market and meet their growing demand. In our marketplace, an estimated $30 billion is spent each year by Americans alone trying to lose weight. 73% of people claim to take steps to eat healthier, and 78% of people also consume a food because it makes their life easier. Assuming we target the American market first before reaching out globally, then there are 96 million Americans aged 18-40 (most likely age group to use a smartphone app and/or web site), and based on the above percentages, a potential serviceable market of roughly 72 million people initially. If we can reach just 0.1% market share in the first year, the product will be profitable and able to set the stage to fund other products, research, and projects along the food supply chain over time. To meet the challenge of engaging that market, our market adoption plan includes targeting 4 events: the Institute of Food and Technologists Trade Show (24,000 attendees), the Food and Nutrition Conference and Expo (10,500 attendees), the Americas Food and Beverage Show and Conference (12,000 attendees), and the American Food Fair (60,000 attendees). In addition to these events, we also have an advertising approach that will focus on podcasts frequently listened to by our target audience and by targeted online advertising with high impressions, reach, and engagement rates. We will also measure click-through rate but feel that the first three KPIs are better measures of an advertising campaign's success.</p>
<p>Another risk is true of anyone doing software development, bugs and troubleshooting. We will have a work plan with milestones, progress, and we will keep all of our backers updated along the way. So, if delays come up, you will know when we know, and you'll know what steps we're taking to overcome any issues along the way. We have developed commercial projects before and host all of our customer-facing projects in the cloud (typically AWS) ensuring security, and all transactions from the subscription fee for the app are handled by Apple and Google through the App Store and Google Play, so we won't be collecting anyone's personal financial information through the app.</p>
<p>Lastly, as with any other commercial product, we have to worry about liabilities. We have a law firm who have worked with us previously on our operating agreement and will be with us to put together our terms of use and protect our intellectual property and trademarks to ensure we mitigate any and all legal risks that may arise.</p>

My name is Jay Schnell. I'm from Columbus, Ohio.I never knew how to explain what I felt, how I knew that my outside and inside did not match.  Until one day in middle school there was a visitor to my classroom.  He was a former student of my teacher, and he just stopped by out of the blue to visit.  After he left, my teacher explained to us that the boy who visited was transgender, and what that meant.  I finally had a label to explain what I felt.  After that, I remained in denial, and have tried everything to stay female for a long time out of fear of what might happen or what others might think. But I have finally decided to show my true colors.  I have denied myself the opportunity to be the real ME for long enough, and I am proud to say that I am a man.  Over the past 9 months, I have gradually come out to people, and have been living as a male ""full time"" in public.

It will be done by Dr. Medalie.. a very well-known and well-regarded doctor in the field of plastic surgery, especially in surgeries for transgender patients.

 
The Impact 

 
Many transgender guys who have not had top surgery wear a ""binder"" to flatten their chest.   I have tried this for the past 9 months, but have been struggling to wear the binder for any longer than 3 hours at a time.  I have had Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) since I was seventeen years old. I have tried a bunch of medications (and none of them work), and have been admitted to the hospital a few times. I am constantly eating TUMS to try and prevent my symptoms from being unbearable.  I cannot wear tight clothes, especially binders or sports bras.  This kind of compression on my chest makes my GERD symptoms even worse than usual.  Here is what it is like, when I wear a binder:First 30 minutes- not too bad. (but also not very comfortable..imagine wearing one of those elastic knee braces around your chest. Its kind of like that.)1 hour- I start to get nauseated...my stomach hurts and I feel like I canâ€™t get a deep breath.  Once, when I was 6 years old, my sister and I were playing and she locked me in a cabinet and couldnâ€™t find the key.  I was there for over an hour until my mom rescued me.  Wearing my binder for an hour feels just about that claustrophobic.2 hours- I start to have acid refluxâ€¦it is really hard to explain how uncomfortable it is to have what feels like hot lava erupting from my stomach and up my esophagus.  Its kinda hard to carry on a conversation with someone when you feel like your throat is on fireâ€¦3 hours-  This is when I start trying to find scissors or the jaws of life to get me the hell OUT of my binder.  After three hours, running around topless almost seems like a preferable option to how horrible I feel.So, as I am sure you can understand, the reason I am trying to get the top surgery done soon is because to finally get rid of this painful part of my life.  The physical pain of wearing the binder is making things miserable; and not only that, I am ready to take the next step in my transition.  Bras and binders have caused me physical and emotional pain ever since I got my first training bra when I was 9.  I am ready to be free from this, to take a deep breat, and to be my real self.  I canâ€™t wait to finally have the body on the outside that matches how I feel on the inside.What We Need & What You GetThe surgery costs $6,000, but I am trying to raise $4,000 of it via this site.  Any donations are greatly appreciated, no matter what the amount.  You can choose to donate the amounts listed on the right and receive a perk (or can choose â€œno perkâ€) OR you can choose any other amount youâ€™d like.  Either way, you will be helping me get one step ncloser to my goal, which is the most amazing gift I could ever ask for! Thank you for your support -- I appreciate it more than I can say!!!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

What started as a simple idea to create a healthy way to energize our bodies and support organic Hawaiian agriculture has grown into an incredible family of loving supporters and a product that we're truly excited to share with the world.</h3>
<p style=""color: #636363; margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 30px; font-size: 13px; font-weight: 500; letter-spacing: .1px; text-align: justify;""><strong>Creating the blend</strong> was our first challenge. We knew we wanted Noni to be our first ingredient after learning about its story of coming to Hawaii by boat over two thousand years ago and being used by the natives as the island's main source of medicine. So we worked hard to create a flavor that balanced its 'distinct' :) taste with a mixture of mango, acai, goji, passion fruit, and other organic fruits until we had something that tasted right. We're proud of this because most Noni is sold as a concentrate and is rarely, if ever, blended in a way that tastes this great.</p>
<p style=""color: #636363; margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 30px; font-size: 13px; font-weight: 500; letter-spacing: .1px; text-align: justify;""><strong>Getting certified</strong> was our next goal. We wanted to create a product that people could trust was safe and only made from the best ingredients. So with some much appreciated capital from friends and family we raised enough money to not only certify Ola USDA Organic, but we also paid to have our bottler certified too! We didn't stop there, we also worked to source ingredients from farmers who are paid fairly for their goods and become fair trade certified by Fair Trade USA. The kicker, Ola is currently working to become a B-Certified corporation- a way of making sure our company never loses focus of our commitment to taking care of all of our stakeholders and never putting profits ahead of people.</p>

This spring the Ola team worked with designers and creative experts in our community to develop a presence that would help us stand out with a great label, Ola gear, a new <a href=""http://www.hawaiianola.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Hawaiian Ola Website"">website</a> and window art for merchants who plan to carry our product in their stores.</p>

</div></div>","When we discovered that most of the world's Noni was not being grown organically and less than 1% of all energy shots are made with fair-trade ingredients and that Hawaii's number one export is genetically modified corn seed and that 99% of all energy shots contain harmful preservatives, we did something crazy...

We created an organic, fair trade, vegan, gluten-free, GMO-free, energy shot made from over 75% real superfruit juice from plants that can be grown sustainably in Hawaii and caffeinated it with organic mate & green tea.

We're calling it Hawaiian Ola (oh-la) and maybe it's a longshot but we have a hunch that we're not alone. We think people are tired of colored sugar-water with synthetic caffeine and chemical preservatives so we're bringing this idea to you for the support we need to make it real. 

Over the last year our team has come a long way. What started as a simple idea to create a healthy way to energize our bodies and support organic Hawaiian agriculture has grown into an incredible family of loving supporters and a product that we're truly excited to share with the world.
Creating the blend was our first challenge. We knew we wanted Noni to be our first ingredient after learning about its story of coming to Hawaii by boat over two thousand years ago and being used by the natives as the island's main source of medicine. So we worked hard to create a flavor that balanced its 'distinct' :) taste with a mixture of mango, acai, goji, passion fruit, and other organic fruits until we had something that tasted right. We're proud of this because most Noni is sold as a concentrate and is rarely, if ever, blended in a way that tastes this great.
Getting certified was our next goal. We wanted to create a product that people could trust was safe and only made from the best ingredients. So with some much appreciated capital from friends and family we raised enough money to not only certify Ola USDA Organic, but we also paid to have our bottler certified too! We didn't stop there, we also worked to source ingredients from farmers who are paid fairly for their goods and become fair trade certified by Fair Trade USA. The kicker, Ola is currently working to become a B-Certified corporation- a way of making sure our company never loses focus of our commitment to taking care of all of our stakeholders and never putting profits ahead of people.
Making it pop was important to us. This spring the Ola team worked with designers and creative experts in our community to develop a presence that would help us stand out with a great label, Ola gear, a new website and window art for merchants who plan to carry our product in their stores.
How you can help:
Now Ola is ready to share; we're all set to bottle our first 50,000 shots in July 2012 and need you to help prove this product is something that the people really want. All we're asking is that you support what we're doing by making a contribution to our project in exchange for some really cool rewards.
Aside from being one of the first to try Ola, by making a contribution you'll be supporting the social and environmental changes that our team is working hard to create.

FAQ for Contributors:
Payments are processed through Paypal which ensures the security of your transaction. That does not mean that you need to have a Paypal account nor that you have to create one. You can use any Credit Card.
Shipping costs will be added to all contributions that require shipping. If you're in northern California for our summer release party, you can skip shipping costs and simply pickup your rewards in person. We'd love to have you, so if you can make it, email contact@hawaiianola.com for details.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p><b>Almost at the InDemand goal--thanks!</b><br/></p><p>-----<br/>Amid the heat of North Carolina in July, six cars line up for one of the heat races for the Global Rallycross Championship round at the Dirt Track at Charlotte Motor Speedway. A lady in black crosses to the center of the start line and holds up a simple sign: 30. Thirty seconds to the start. She waits a bit, then flips the sign around and gives one more wave in front of the drivers: 10. Ten seconds, walking off, 9, 8, 7, the drivers anticipating the start. After those ten seconds come the lights: a sequence of five red lights, one after the other, the illumination of which causes the field of cars to stop sounding like cars and start sounding like something resembling Satan's popcorn machine. The crackling and backfiring continues until the red lights cease, and a set of green lights unleashes <b>3500 horsepower</b>--six cars as much power as thirty of their showroom-floor siblings.<br/><br/>As the cars moved off the small patch of pavement onto the dirt and clay that made up most of the rest of the circuit, the two Subaru Imprezas of Sverre Isachsen and Bucky Lasek pulled ahead from their front row starting positions and bore toward the inside part of the first corner, with Lasek converging on the other front row starter, Patrik Sandell. Sandell, trying to hold his Ford Fiesta's position against the charging Volkswagen Polo of Tanner Foust, was bumped by both Foust and Lasek, <b>sending him straight into the water-filled barrier</b> on the inside of the turn. Sandell's car was lodged in the barriers, forcing the officials to stop the race to remove the crippled car. With the Swede irritated and his car disabled, then, the race was restarted with the space between Isachsen and Lasek empty.<br/><br/>As the green lights came on to start the race, Isachsen pulled ahead, with Lasek behind. Once again, Lasek moved inside, once again Lasek found another car--this time Foust--and once again the car found the barrier. This time, however, Foust continued, despite hitting both the obstacle and immediately being collided into by the Ford of rookie Austin Dyne. As the cars continued to complete the first lap of the heat, the barrier sat in the middle of the track, in an even more prone position than Sandell's car earlier. Above the racing surface, in the press box, the status of the race puzzled some of the press corps, accustomed to the stock car and sprint car races that run at the speedway complex the rest of the season. In any other form of racing, the race would have either been slowed or stopped by this point. Series media director Chris Leone reassured the booth that this was not the case: ""<b>This is rallycross.

A lady in black crosses to the center of the start line and holds up a simple sign: 30. Thirty seconds to the start. She waits a bit, then flips the sign around and gives one more wave in front of the drivers: 10. Ten seconds, walking off, 9, 8, 7, the drivers anticipating the start. After those ten seconds come the lights: a sequence of five red lights, one after the other, the illumination of which causes the field of cars to stop sounding like cars and start sounding like something resembling Satan's popcorn machine. The crackling and backfiring continues until the red lights cease, and a set of green lights unleashes 3500 horsepower--six cars as much power as thirty of their showroom-floor siblings.As the cars moved off the small patch of pavement onto the dirt and clay that made up most of the rest of the circuit, the two Subaru Imprezas of Sverre Isachsen and Bucky Lasek pulled ahead from their front row starting positions and bore toward the inside part of the first corner, with Lasek converging on the other front row starter, Patrik Sandell. Sandell, trying to hold his Ford Fiesta's position against the charging Volkswagen Polo of Tanner Foust, was bumped by both Foust and Lasek, sending him straight into the water-filled barrier on the inside of the turn. Sandell's car was lodged in the barriers, forcing the officials to stop the race to remove the crippled car. With the Swede irritated and his car disabled, then, the race was restarted with the space between Isachsen and Lasek empty.As the green lights came on to start the race, Isachsen pulled ahead, with Lasek behind. Once again, Lasek moved inside, once again Lasek found another car--this time Foust--and once again the car found the barrier. This time, however, Foust continued, despite hitting both the obstacle and immediately being collided into by the Ford of rookie Austin Dyne. As the cars continued to complete the first lap of the heat, the barrier sat in the middle of the track, in an even more prone position than Sandell's car earlier. Above the racing surface, in the press box, the status of the race puzzled some of the press corps, accustomed to the stock car and sprint car races that run at the speedway complex the rest of the season. In any other form of racing, the race would have either been slowed or stopped by this point. Series media director Chris Leone reassured the booth that this was not the case: ""This is rallycross. We don't believe in yellow flags.""Sure enough, the battle for the lead--with Isachsen being hounded by the Ford of 2013 Lites class winner Joni Wiman--had to go through the mangled barrier and the trail of debris surrounding it, with Lasek getting a piece of the action a couple seconds later to ensure that every car in the heat had hit the now-useless lump of plastic.

Unlike most snacks or meal replacements on the market, NuBello offers balanced nutrition that boosts your metabolism, and keeps you feeling fuller longer- making it easier to resist unhealthy food choices.
""NuBello offers complete nutrition in with low-calories...""
NuBello is free of artificial sweeteners. It's sweetened with stevia, a natural sugar that has been used in South America for centuries.





NuBello promotes weight loss through natural means by giving you the nutrition you need to control cravings, reduce persistent hunger, boost mood and energy to motivate you on your weight loss journey, helping you achieve real results. 
NuBello is more than a weight loss supplement or an appetite suppressant. It offers a long-term health and weight loss solution that naturally works with your body to boost weight loss and energy. NuBello isn't a quick fix, rather it's about giving you more of the nutrient dense foods you need in one simple drink. 




Calcium - Not only great for healthy bones, calcium helps you lose fat while preserving muscle, and acts as an important calorie and fat-burning aid.
Fiber - helps reduce your appetite by keeping you feeling fuller, longer- making it easier to resist bad foods; generally, reducing your overall calorie consumption.
Vitamin D - is a essential nutrient that many of us are lacking. Vitamin D not only promotes strong bones, muscles and joints, but helps you lose weight.
Vitamin B12 - plays a role in how well your body uses the calories it consumes. B12 also boosts energy and enhances mood, giving you the energy you need to adopt a more active lifestyle, which is essential to long-term health and wellness.
Protein - helps curb hunger and preserve muscle mass to help you lose weight. 
At NuBello we designed a super-blend of over 30 fruits and vegetables that has more of what the body and mind needs to help you loss weight, stabilize your metabolism and boost your energy to achieve long-term wellness.


We’re all familiar with the ancient grain of wisdom that ""Health is Wealth,"" but given the hectic pace of our lives, we can't always make the best food choices, and that's where NuBello comes in...
NuBello is a quick, delicious, easy solution to great nutrition. 
Convenient and ideal for an on-the-go lifestyle, NuBello was designed for more diets and nutrition needs than ordinary protein powders. Featuring a unique proprietary blend of over 30 super fruits & vegetables, NuBello is the Nu Wave in Health, Stress & Weight Loss Management.





A Complete Meal- NuBello is one of the lowest calorie, super fruit and veggie blends available. It's a complete meal that's perfect for your on-the-go lifestyle.
Sweetened with all-natural stevia, this gluten-free, no soy, no dairy, delicious plant-based protein is a nutritional powerhouse with stress-reducing vitamins & antioxidants that not only boost your mood and memory, but gives you a concentrated source of energy to help you get through your busy day.
Raspberries - Loaded with antioxidants, raspberries provide a rich source of Vitamin C, Fiber and Manganese, a super fruit with anti-cancer and anti-aging properties.
As a low sugar and low calorie fruit, raspberries play an important role in weight loss management. They release natural sugar slowly, and are sweet enough to help satisfy cravings to prevent sudden spikes in blood-sugar levels.
B Vitamins: B1, B2, B6, B12, Folic acid - Many of us don't get enough Vitamin B, an essential nutrient that helps boost mood and memory. Vitamin B helps the body manage stress levels, reducing anxiety and symptoms of depression while providing a remarkable source of vital energy.
Atlantic Kelp - Is a sea plant packed with heart-healthy nutrients, including manganese and iodine to help regulate thyroid function and aid weight loss.
Vitamin D - D3 is an important vitamin that is mainly obtained by exposure to sunlight. Most foods are low sources of Vitamin D, so with this added dietary supplement, you'll get the convenient health benefits of strong bones, calcium balance, reduced risk of depression and improved kidney function.
Stevia - Stevia is an all-natural sweetener that's the perfect replacement for sugar and artificial substitutes. Stevia has a low glycemic index, making it a great option for those following low carb lifestyles.

Should I drink NuBello with my meal or as a meal replacement?
Packed with a full spectrum of plant-based proteins and complex carbs, NuBello is designed to stand on its own as a meal and will keep you feeling full and energized. 
Can I add it to anything besides just water? 
Yes! You can stir it into your favorite juice, iced black or herbal tea, almond milk, hemp milk or even blend it with your favorite smoothies... the possibilities are virtually endless. 
How does it compare to other meal replacement drinks?
NuBello provides clean, plant-based fuel that can nip the effects of stress by providing you with a full and complete meal in one simple drink. And we're totally junk free: none of the most common dietary allergens - soy, gluten, nuts, and dairy.
What's actually in NuBello?
• Easily digestible plant-based protein with amino acids
• Complex carbs from cruciform vegetables like broccoli, kale, spinach, plus legumes and algae
• Naturally occurring enzymes to ease digestion
• Powerful and protective antioxidants from sourced like apples, oranges, and pineapples to help reduce free radicals caused by stress and pollution 
• A robust amount of the daily recommended servings of fruits / veggies
• COQ10 for heart health - B-complex vitamin for energy and vitality
• 400 mg vitamin D3 for mood support, bone density, overall health 
What happens if we exceed our stated goal?
We will increase our order size from our manufacturer to fulfill our Indiegogo perk demand. 

Is NuBello currently in production?
NuBello Raspberry is currently in production and is projected to be ready for distribution by the end of the year. We are hoping to fulfill shipments before the Holiday Season. NuBello will make for a perfect compliment for this time of year.  It will also make for a great gift!

</h3>When Denise Jefferson was diagnosed with cancer for the <i>second </i>time, she knew she'd have to fight, again. And she will win, again. But not without first enduring the painful regiment of chemotherapy.<br/><br/>Of course, being pumped full of chemo, it wasn't long before people started to recognize a change in our vibrant, hands-on, go-get-em woman. As her friends started to see Denise's energy level slow and as they read her open diary detailing her treatment plan, people began to ask ""How can I help?"" <br/><br/>The thing is, it isn't always easy to think of a quick response when someone says, ""What can I do for you?""<br/><br/>But then, Denise had an idea! What if there were coupon books that cancer patients could carry around and when someone did offer to help they could rip out one of these ""Caring Coupons"" and give it to that person, right there, in the moment, when the offer for help was being made? Brilliant idea if you ask me! Which is why I jumped on the offer to design the books.<br/><br/>But more important than the design, was really knowing what people needed help with. Denise had that covered, too. She and her daughter, Ashley, interviewed a room full of cancer patients at a local chemo clinic, and in just a short while they had 40 different coupon ideas. <br/><br/>These ideas that came straight from those that would need the help as they were more focused on fighting for their health and their life to manage some of the other jobs that seem so easy to most of us.<br/><br/><h3>Caring Coupon Goal<br/>
</h3>The goal is to have 100 Caring Coupon books printed in time for Denise to give out to her cancer-fighting warrior friends on her final day of chemotherapy treatment. That last day of her chemo is slotted for March 20, 2014! <br/><ul>

We had love, and support from eachother to make it through our hard times, but recently we found out about our grandmother, who recently developed cancer, needed to be treated out of state. Being low income, and having family members helping her out times are getting even harder for her. There are so many costs going through treatments, paying for medications, travel expenses ect. that it is getting very hard for her to come up with the money for her medical expenses. We are trying to raise $5000 for her for her operation, treatments, medications, travel expenses, a motel room for the few weeks she will be there, and anything else related to her condition with cancer. Even if we do not meet our goal of $5000 the money will still go twards her treatments. I live out of state and my immediate family is also very low income. We cannot be there for my grandma in person, I would really love to be there for her but with living expenses and providing for my family we do not have the extra money to travel to New York from Florida.

If you could please help my grandmother get the treatments she needs we, (grandma and the family), would be greatly apprecieative of your help and support to make her treatments possible. Thank you for the time you took to read about my grandmother, and thank you for helping me raise the money it takes to make my grandmother healthy again.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p> 
Our mother turned 62 this year but this year has been different from any other.  December 2010 my mother woke one night vomiting blood.  I rushed her to the hospital due to the amount of blood.  The doctors confirmed what we thought, she had a stomach ulcer.  The next day the doctor came in and informed us that something was strange on my mother's X-ray and the hospital was not equipped to diagnose the issue and would transfer her to Greenville, but refused to tell us anything.  After arriving at Greenville and several test later we were informed that my mother has cirrhosis of the liver, stage 4 caused by hepatitis C.  The doctor informed us that in the late 70's and early 80's many people contracted Hepititis C due to blood transfusions because this was not checked by hospitals back then.  p&gt;</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>At stage four the only hope my mother has is a liver transplant but currently her insurance will not pay for a transplant.  Without a transplant my mother doesn't have a long time left but with a new liver she could live to be 90 plus. Mom has a 6 year old granddaughter and we want her to be a part of her and our life for as long as possible.   We are taking as many steps as we possibly can by changing her diet and increasing exercise but this will only help so much. Currently she takes 8 different medications (some insurance doesn't pay) plus shots. Mom is seeing the doctors now every 2 months. She has been hospitalized 3 times since finding out this news. 

This has changed our lives and we are trying to do everything we can to make her happy and keep her going. Sometimes we forget that she has this awful stuff going on in her body but then we will quickly be reminded by doctors or emergency room visits. Mom has the best attitude and keeps pushing herself to stay in the best health she can.
p&gt;</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p> All the money we raise will be used to pay for Moms medical bills and treatments. Every dollar helps no amount too small.

<p>My name is Aaron DeTienne and I'm originally from Northern Colorado.  I joined the Air Force last year and in order to maintain the best shape I'd ever been in (basic training), I got into triathalons.</p>
<p>As most of you know the government has cut a lot of the normal funding for troops.  Normally there is enough money in the budget to hold an event for our deployed troops coming home.  This year, however, there isn't enough money.</p>
<p>I will be competing in the Boise 1/2 Ironman and I'm askng for pledges.  100% of the money donated will be given to the ""Warrior Club"" who puts on the ""Coming Home"" event.</p>
<p><strong>THE EVENT</strong></p>
<p>The 1/2 Ironman consists of the three parts of a triathalon.</p>
<p>1) 1.2 Mile Swim</p>
<p>2) 56 Mile Bike Ride</p>
<p>3) 13.1 Mile run (1/2 marathon)</p>

<h2>Short Summary</h2>
<p><span>The documentary “Ayurveda: Healing the victim and the slayer” serves as a medium to inform and awaken the public concerning the issue of Ayurveda, the ancient Indian therapeutic method. Moreover, demonstrates facts of the imminent danger faced by one of the primary botanical gardens of Southern India which hosts plants of exquisite pharmaceutical value. Ayurvedic and Yunani ( Ionian-Greek) therapeutical Art is based on these rare plants which are threatened by extinction.</span></p>
<p><span>Indicative is the fact that Yunanian Medicine/Healing method is a descendant of the therapeutic methods that Hippokrates used in ancient Greece, a few parts of which are still preserved in Greek Phytotherapy.</span></p>
<p><span>Both Ayurveda and Yunani therapeutic methods are consider either complementary or alternative healing methods in the Western world, and are being adopted by 83% of the Indian population nowadays.</span></p>
<p><span>To continue with, Dr. Aithal (the main therapist protagonist of the documentary) shows us his personal journey through the creation of his prototypal botanical garden as well as the therapies he offers his fellow citizens and animals free of charge. He also reveals his therapeutic “discoveries” and secrets, since he considers knowledge to be a product of God’s wisdom and not his.</span></p>
<p>The Impact</p>
</div>
<p>This project is very important for the world to know, because it shows that by using alternative medicine/natural methods we are able to cure illneses that can't be cured with classical methods even nowadays that medicine has progressed so much.</p>
<p>Your contribution will make a big difference to the world by helping us completing this documentary. Give us the oportunity to inform the people that there are alternative ways to deal with their medical problems without having to pay a huge amount of money to hospitals and chemical drugs. They should know that they have a choice. </p>
<p>Moreover  Dr. Aithal casts enormous effort in spreading his knowledge of Ayurvedic medicine to the new generations so it won't be lost in the future.</p>
<h2>Our production team in order to help Dr. Aithal we are commited to donate 10 % of our current funding budget and 15% of all future gains from the documentary to sustain his botanical garden and his school of Ayurvedic medicine.</h2>

<h3>__________________</h3>
<h3>Hello!  My name is Grandma Tilly and I am the owner and operator of The Wellspring Center for Holistic Healing.  I am many things to many people, including spiritual advisor/minister, wife, mother, lesbian activist, grandma, sister, friend, and so much more.  I am also a Theta healer and energy healer.  </h3>
<h3>I love running The 'Spring because it affords me the opportunity to work with and help so many people in our community, and through the wonderful world of skype and the 'net - people from around the country.  </h3>
<p>The campaign we've started on Indiegogo is incredibly important for the future of our business.  When we opened, we were charging the ""going rates"" for services, and discovered that most people can't afford to pay $60.00 bucks an hour or more for Reiki or Theta when their insurance will cover a visit to the local pain clinic for a co-pay of $20.00.  Would they love to have holistic healing as a part of their recovery or wellness process?  Yup.  Can they afford it?  Not really.</p>
<p>With the funds raised here on Indiegogo, we're going to incorporate The Spring as a non-profit organization and hire a grant-writer to help us fund the center for an even wider service protocol; including holistic substance abuse treatment services to help the local drug and alcohol addiction treatment centers!  How exciting is that?  We think it's pretty dang exciting!</p>
<p>By contributing to our campaign, you will be helping us to help many others.  Every dollar you contribute is exponential in its ability to heal and project goodness to those who so desperately need our help. </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Ge</strong>t</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The 501-c-3 costs will come out of the $5000.00 first and foremost.  This will put us on a playing feild where local and outside businesses and individuals can contribute to our center and receive the tax deduction for their gift.</p>
<p>Next, we'll hire a grant writer for roughly $1500.00.</p>
<p>All of these processes take time, of course, so the remainder of the funds raised from this intial campaign will keep The 'Spring in full swing as we iron out the details of our incorporation and search for grants and programs for which we might qualify.  </p>
<p>Currently, our rent is only $350.00, but we need to expand. We can rent a second room in our building for $200.00 that will become our new treatment room, and expand our retail space to offer more multi-faith goods to our community.  Remember, all of the proceeds from the retail shop go to support The 'Spring, as well.  (See, there's that exponential investment again.) We'll pay for three months of rent from the funds raised here, for a total of $1650.00.</p>
<p>The remaining $1350.00 will be used for stipends and other expenses (insurance, internet bills - our electricity is included in the rent for the office space, yay! - and to purchase the supplies necessary for the perks).  We should have enough to meet our obligations to you, our investors, as well as sundry expenses for at least three months.</p>
<p>If we do not meet our funding goal, we'll use the funds for these same expenditures in the order they are listed.  First - we'll put it aside for the incorporation, next: the grant writer, then: rent and other expenses.  The very last thing the funds would be used for is stipends.</p>
<p>If we fund more than we're planning, we'll use the excess funds to create new programs earlier than expected and create working partnerships with other services in our community - such as the local hopsital, the drug courts, and the mental health services department. </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>There are many people in the world who know how awesome and powerful holistic healing is.  We see it every day.  </p>
<p>Last week, one of our clients stopped by for an energy healing session before she underwent brain surgery.  She was frightened, as you can imagine.  She had arranged to take several months off work and planned her convelescence at her mother's home prior to her last day at work, and was worried about how long she would be ""under the weather."" </p>
<p>After an hour of intensive energy work with three experienced practitioners, she was confident, relaxed and ready to take on the world - and the surgeon.  </p>
<p>On the day of her surgery, she spent less than one hour in recovery and less than 2 days in the hospital.  One week later, and she was ready to return to living on her own - actually, she was ready long before that, but her mother insisted she stay a while longer.</p>
<p>We did not charge this woman a single dime for the services we provided.  She needed the work, and her insurance doesn't cover it. She has enough expenses to worry about with co-payments on incredbily expensive surgery and follow-up care/treatments.  </p>
<p>When you help us set up this holistic healing center in the way we've planned, you'll help us provide this type of service to a great number of individuals who truly need it; who can benefit from it; and who deserve it.</p>
</div>
<div>

<h3>In 2006, I spent time volunteering in Phnom Penh Cambodia.</h3>
<p>I met Sambon - a teenage orphan living with my Khmer teacher and her family in poor circumstances. She had nothing and was fortunate to have a roof over her head. She earns her keep my helping around their home. Sambon was grateful for a few T-shirts and a pair of sandals I bought her.</p>
<p>Her biggest health issue was that she had absolutely no teeth (reasonably common in Cambodia). This also affected her confidence and chance of finding a job, a husband and having her own family - finally some independence.</p>
<p>My mum and I paid for a full set of new teeth for her and took her to all her dentist appointments.</p>
<p>Recently my Khmer teacher - Samnang - has contacted me again to say that Sambon's teeth are starting to need work, totalling a few hundred dollars. In a country where many people still live on a dollar a day, this is a big deal.</p>
<p>I am hoping people will help me to get Sambon's teeth fixed! Ultimately I would also like to help her get some English lessons and some training - but one step at a time!</p>

<p>My name is Makayla Pasco and I have scoliosis.  Scoliosis is a medical condition in which a person's spine grows curved from side to side.  <span>Although it is a complex </span><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoliosis"" id=""_GPLITA_3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Powered by Text-Enhance""></a><span>deformity, on an X-ray, viewed from the rear, the spine of an individual with scoliosis may look more like an ""S"" or a ""C"",  as you can see in my x-ray above.</span>  </p>
<p>Now a little about me!  I have always loved sports, especially soccer.  Soccer has always been one of my passions and I began playing when I was 5.  I quit at 15 but after being inspired by the 2010 World Cup, I decided to try out for my junior college soccer team.  After two semesters of training, I made the team!  I knew that it would be alot of work to get back into shape but it felt like my body was rejecting all of my efforts.  Breathing was really difficult and recovering from a short sprint was almost impossible.  Deep, painful cramps would pinch my sides, making running really hard and my knees felt like they were always in the wrong direction.  One day after practice, I went to visit my step mom and half brother and I complained that my back hurt.  When I bent over to stretch it out, my step moms face was filled with horror at my lobsided back.  Her shock influenced us to schedule x-rays and that's where we discovered that my scoliosis had worsened.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Here we are now a year later, scheduling my surgery!  </h3>
<p>I was diagnosed with scoliosis at a young age and endured 4 years of bracing.  My treatment required me to wear a day brace and a night brace, only taking it off to shower or play sports.  The day brace I had was smaller but permanently disfigured my waist line.  Because of my day brace, I had to buy large clothes that would fit over it.  I felt so insecure that I usually wore really large sweatshirts, even when it was hot outside.  Sometimes, that gave me rashes from the hot plastic rubbing up against my skin.  My night brace was much larger than the day brace and rendered me imobile during the night. It forced my hips straight but tilted my upper body, making sleeping very difficult.  I fell asleep crying from the discomfort most nights.  At 13, I was freed from the brace and told by my doctor that I did not need to come back because I was finished growing so there was nothing more the brace could do for me.  Since then, my back has progressed from 35 degrees to 50-55, depending on who is reading the x-ray.  This is because I have progressive scolisosis.  I've been told that it is extremely rare and most patients who are treated by bracing do not experience this.  As a result of this condition, my lungs are being crushed by my deformed rib cage, my heart is not in the correct cavity, and I have shrunk an inch!  In addition, my  hips are rotated causing my spine to rotate and my surrounding muscles are very tight.  I have had knee surgery on my left knee, possibly because of the way my scoliosis is twisting my legs.  Everyday activities are painful such as sitting, walking, running, and standing.  If i am not treated by surgery soon, it will continue to progress 1-2 degrees a year for the rest of my life!   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Your contribution to my surgery and recovery would give me a chance at living a life without pain and discomfort.  I would have the opportunity to play soccer at my full potential or do anything physical that I could not before!  With surgery, I also will grow a couple of inches so that would be really cool too :)</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Examples of expenses I will need help with:</h3>
<p>Surgery co-pay, hotel for my family, physical therapy for 6 months to a year, home care, and im sure other things i havent thought about!</p>

<p>Hi everyone and thank you so much for reading Makayla's indiegogo page.  As a mother, you only want the best for your children.  Makayla was always a leader with her friends when she was in grade school.  When the back brace was implemented, I watched my sparkling leader shrink into the backround.  Her outspoken confidence went inside her somewhere and was replaced by uncertainty and self conciousness.  My little leader became a wall flower.  I would love nothing more for Makayla's pain and deformed back to be replaced with a straight spine and straight forward, outgoing, confident personality once again.  She is so beautiful to me inside and out and deserves a life free of pain and discomfort.  We just need some assistance with the overwhelming expenses of this surgery and recovery costs.</p>

<h3>The story</h3>
<p>When   my youngest daughter was a few weeks old my wife and I noticed that   something was wrong, our daughter wasn't gaining weight and appeared to   be in pain constantly. We read and researched, studied and connected   with other families, talked to our friends and doctors. We ended up with   a bunch of guesses and no answers. But we did have a supportive   community to help us try new things and vet suggestions. Eventually my   wife and I started to notice a pattern. Our daughter would suffer the   most close to feedings. This was fantastic we finally were able to find a   pattern.  What we needed now was a way for mom to stay nourished,   eating enough calories to provide for mom and baby while at the same   time discover the offending foods. InciteYourself was born out of a need   that I had that I could not find. We needed a way to record what food   mom ate when while also recording what reactions baby had at what times   of what severity so I could ask a few simple questions,<span class=""arbitrary""> what are the top   10 ingredients eaten 4, 6, 8, or 10 hours prior to the most sever   reactions in baby</span>. </p>

Since 1997, our organization has been inspiring volunteers to take children in to their homes and see that they have their critical medical needs met.
Wherever children are affected by war, Solace will offer the children healing and tools for bringing lasting peace, beginning with the children of Afghanistan.


This year God put it on my heart to start a Solace for the Children branch in Southern Pines, NC. We started late (December) so we focused on getting good host families and good volunteers first. Now we have to get the funding for transportation.


It cost over $3000 per each child just for the transportation and travel related expenses to bring them to the USA. This year Southern Pines,NC branch will be bringing six children starting on June 21, 2003. 


We have run out of time, the host families are set, the plane tickets reserved, the medical providers are preparing for their arrival. To make this happening I am doing something crazy, I'm selling my ""Truck for Buck"". For the first 300 donors that donate $60 or more to Solace for the Children-Southern Pines their names will be entered into a drawing. On July 20th, I will have one of the kids draw from a maximum 300 names and that person will have the right to buy my used Toyota 4Runner (in picture above) for one dollar. We are giving 60 opportunities for donors to the public through Indiegogo.

<p>Dear friends,</p>
<p>I have a story, but that's not what this is about. Sure I've had my share of hardships and the side dishes of anxiety, escapism, insomnia and depression that have challenged me. I am sure you have too. I have found that it is not the story that matters, but what I do with what I've learned. We all have difficulties, but there is always someone who is facing something harder. Kids, especially deserve our attention.  In our overstimulated, overstressed world, where lockdown drills are part of their educational experience, kids deserve a safe place. A place where they can connect with who they are and what they want to become. If their world is rife with stress or violence, it affects many people, and eventually, many more. So, instead of telling my story, I am taking action to become part of a larger community story, to contribute towards better options through the health practice of yoga. My goal is to train to teach and offer yoga therapy to mothers and kids who are experiencing stress or hardship.</p>
<p>As I’ve worked through difficult periods in my life, with the accompanying stress and anxiety, I have gained a deeper appreciation for suffering. I have found strength through yoga. It has literally been the pathway to peace and given me a sense of being at the wheel of my life. It has given me tools to work with in times of weakness and despair, and helped me find rest. This has inspired me to become a lifelong student of the practice and pursue teaching. I know firsthand that the practice of yoga can ease suffering in mind, body and spirit. I want to put that knowledge to use and become a resource in my community. I aim to offer yoga to people who might normally have no access to it due to economic hardship or circumstance. I want to bring yoga into schools and shelters, and eventually integrate with health providers. I specifically want to offer this health option to women and children.</p>
<p>Yoga has <a href=""http://nccam.nih.gov/health/yoga/introduction.htm#hed5"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Yoga for health"">proven beneficial effects</a>, and is now a widely accepted health practice by the medical community. Yoga promotes many health benefits for both adults and children, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved ability to focus</li>
<li>A healthy and balanced sense of strength</li>
<li>Emotional balance</li>
<li>Increased flexibility and cardio strength</li>
<li>Decreased anxiety and insomnia</li>
<li>A sense of calm and quality of life</li>
</ul><p>My long term intention is to be a yoga therapist and create more access to this health practice. I want to concentrate my efforts towards those who are encountering significant stress or illness. I am particularly inspired by <a href=""http://youtu.be/FcVwB1t4aUU"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Yoga for Kids"">people working with kids</a> who face great difficulties just growing up. </p>
<h3><span>About Me</span></h3>
<p>I am a mother, raising an amazing son, a creative professional and a lifelong student of health and nutrition. Making a contribution to society is important to me, especially investing in the kids. I have practiced yoga in a sporadic way for the last 20 years in an attempt to find peace and balance. The last few years, as I faced some extraordinary challenges, while being a mother to a young child, I finally got it. As I turned more and more to yoga, I learned the nourishment and healing that this very basic practice can provide. It offered me a path to peace through my body and calmed my anxious, chattering mind. I still find my time on the yoga mat to be challenging, yet the benefits continue to spread out like concentric circles through my life and offer rewards in a very measurable way.</p>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 2em;"">Vision</span></h3>
<p>This campaign is the first step towards becoming a certified yoga therapist, beginning with my 200 hour teacher training this summer. I'll then pursue my 500 hour training and specialized yoga therapy certification.</p>
<p>I want to bring the empowering potential of yoga practice into communities that are experiencing need, but have no access to yoga, or peace and quiet.  Specifically, I want to work with mothers and children who may find themselves up against great odds, due to economic hardship, divorce, domestic violence, PTSD, bullying at school or work, depression or illness. I want to offer a way to access inner strength through a mind-body practice that can be done anywhere, for free. </p>
<h1>Plan</h1>
<p>I plan to complete my first level of yoga certification this summer through intensive workshops. I've been studying with a gifted set of teachers at a studio in Austin who's training is accredited by the Yoga Alliance, which means they are legit. I will continue my full time job and arrange my time around the intensives. I will need to raise $3000 to achieve this goal, and $300 to facilitate this effort, which I hope to raise through this campaign. I will pay forward every cent.</p>
<p>Once I complete this training, I will get my sea legs as a teacher by offering yoga for free through a community yoga project, which brings yoga to domestic violence and children’s shelters in Austin. I will also connect with a few local teachers who are bringing yoga to kids in after-school programs.</p>
<h1>Details</h1>
<p>The training costs $3000, which I intend to pay forward as outlined on the right. For every dollar given, a connection will be made, a gesture of support, strength and healing.</p>
<p>The inspiration to help others comes from my own experience. I understand. Its as if I  have found a flashlight in a dark tunnel. It shines on a pathway that leads out into the light. I want to share that path I have found to standing in the sun, connected to a strong self, to others and to life. </p>
<h1>How You Can Help</h1>
<p>Donate if you can, and you will be rewarded by the knowledge that you helped someone somewhere achieve a little peace in a difficult world, or at least gave your energy towards that end. You can also share this campaign with people you know. I will honor every gesture of good will sent my way.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time spent reading this, your support and encouragement.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">I have never spearheaded one of these fundraiser and yes I am a little embarrassed that I can't just pull my check book and pay for this by myself but truth is - I can't. So I am reaching out to all of you to see if you can help.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Liyani's boyfriend Alex is going through a bit of a rough patch at the moment. He has an incredible passion for skateboarding and to tell you the truth I think he is really good and has great potential. He attended a skate camp once a while ago and loved it so much and when I ask him what his favorite memory in life is - he says those two weeks at Element Skate Camp.

He has an incredible passion for skateboarding and to tell you the truth I think he is really good and has great potential. He attended a skate camp once a while ago and loved it so much and when I ask him what his favorite memory in life is - he says those two weeks at Element Skate Camp.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p><span>Hello ,</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>My name is Donald Castellano, some know me by my nickname D.J. and here’s my story. Originally married in 1997 at the young age of 17 , over the course of 8 years being a father to five beautiful children I knew life would be full of adventure and hard work ahead to support these children. Working a single job still wasn’t enough to support the family, devastatingly only to end in a divorce in 2007 due to irreconcilable differences. Going our separate ways and allowing her to have the children fulltime while I worked, still getting nowhere in life, I decided to continue my education I originally started before my marriage in 1996.</span></p>
<p><span>                While attending school during the daytime (Criminal Justice degree), I also attended night time schooling on my days off (Business &amp; Management degree) to complete it in 2009. I was super proud of finally getting somewhere in life ,being successful towards my children’s future and well being that I decided to take my Criminal Justice degree even further. Moving from one school to the next (due to capacity of finishing an A.S to a B.S.), I stayed steady pursuing my dreams of being a CSI Forensic Examiner for Department of Homeland Security. I knew I would be a big role model to my children, to look up to and wonder why I pursued what I did in matters of my family’s Law Enforcement history. To cherish and be passionate about everything I loved doing, serving the community, protecting their safety, teaching right from wrong while protecting the States from terrorist activities, to say the least, I was there.</span></p>
<p><span>                Till one day I got a phone call from my oldest daughter, Hailey’s teacher. Walking into the room I was in shock to see their Mothers new Mother-In-Law, teacher &amp; State Case Worker all at the table. I was in awe, confused and distracted of my children being in harm’s way. The time I had spent trying to become a better father through education, paying my Child Support &amp; becoming a better role model, was the time that they were being hurt… Physically, emotional and traumatically, the living conditions they were in were horrid. The reports were novels long, lice infested hair, loss of weight due to starvation, abuse marks found on them from the nurse but no notification to me from the school. Their mother had kept it all a secret only to fuel herself of addictive habits with the child support &amp; food stamps she received from the State of Florida for over 2 ½ years. A change had to come, this couldn’t be happening to my children.</span></p>
<p><span>                With the help of the State of Florida, I was awarded<span class=""apple-converted-space""> </span><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">FULL CUSTODY</span><span class=""apple-converted-space""> </span>in Early 2010 of all FIVE children miraculously. Something rarely unheard of, being a REAL father and taking the stand of both role models with inspirational outlooks, I was in for a longer road ahead. Devastatingly that year, June 2010, I took two HUGE blows to my family. 1) We lost a most wonderful cousin, whom was a State Trooper for the State of New Jersey which in turn 2) Caused me to lose my job, of being on Bereavement, to return to work early since my mother flew to New Jersey instead of me. I was in shock, in denial that this was happening the way it was in such a moment in my life of turmoil and disbelief, it couldn’t be.</span></p>
<p><span>                I took charge, liquidating all of my assets, focusing on raising my children the correct way and getting them back on track since they missed quite a few months of schooling and some. I took a leave of absence with my Bachelors degree at my current University with only a year left, the children needed me the most at this critical timing of their lives.  Three of my children were left back that year in school; my oldest daughters THIRD time being left back almost in a row due to lack of education and attendance being her main problematic area. Additional tutoring after school from myself, additional therapists twice a week ordered for them , family group counseling with the six of us over the course of a couple years was in place and last but not least speech therapy for two of my children due to problematic issues while growing up that was not addressed. They were progressing, F’s,D’s to C’s and up to their current point now of being Honor Roll students, the hard work was paying off. They were creative, developing stories for school that were amazing, awards brought home for best effort and dedication in anything they did, it was a priceless.</span></p>
<p><span>                Around the middle of 2011, I started becoming fatigued and in pain. Already bearing a<span class=""apple-converted-space""> </span><strong>single solitary kidney</strong>, always taking good care of my health already, something was wrong for this to happen. I went to my Primary Health Physician to be immediately rushed to the hospital due to high blood pressure. 200+/150+ at first it started… The pain was unbearable; they placed me on one blood pressure medication, only to temporarily work while figuring out what’s going on. Going to a Urologist, Nephrologist to Gastrologist, test after test, it seemed hopeless for a few months. Within a six month time period my Primary Care Physician placed me on 3 different types of blood pressure medications only to refer me to a pain clinic, since the blood pressure medications weren’t totally fixing the problem. Attending the Pain Clinic, I was originally placed on powerful Morphine doses twice a day with another pain medicine in between to resolve my problem from the pain that proceeded to start. 5 medications in total it took for my blood pressure to come back to somewhat a normal range and out of the stroke(<strong>or even death</strong>) levels they were at for months straight on end.</span></p>
<p><span>                I thought it was over, 6 months straight of tests and no resolution but medications that I would have to take for possibly the rest of my life, only being 31 now, it would be a long time. I had already visited the E.R.<span class=""apple-converted-space""> </span><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">17 times at this point</span></strong>, becoming frequent even with the Doctors in the Emergency section alone! Finally finding out what was going on, my Gastrologist had the results. February 2012 I had undergone a Colonoscopy to find out I had a tight, kinked bowel at the hepatic flexure with possible hernia(s) also developing. This was serious, the tests I have been through and also finding out I have kidney stones again (Third time in 10 months) the pain totally is almost indescribable.  2 months into taking the morphine my blood pressure started rising again, 5 medications later and still no permanent resolution, I returned back to my Primary Care once again. </span></p>
<p><span>                Upon multiple visits and tests again with the new specialist, the doctor declined to do surgery as a resolution on this matter.The rarity of my single kidney was causing my bowels to shift towards the right causing the very painful kink currently there at this moment. I don’t smoke, drink or use drugs but still stated due to the onset of the illness it was more of a risk then benefit.Too much of a “Maybe” was the results of everything and from the inconsistency of the problem the responsibility of surgeon,it was too much of a liability for a single doctor to handle this.</span></p>
<p><span>               This is where we are today, the present day and why I ask for your help. I am in desperate need for assistance so I can get back to doing what I do best, raising my children. I am sick and tired of being sick and tired, there has to be hope out to the public. I have no insurance,noone else to care for my children and therefore it seems where I need to be is what I cannot afford. I have given everything I earned since my childhood to my children, to help them be where they are today only to be stuck at a dead end with my health at a steady declining rate. I have nothing left to give to proceed at this point, so I am hoping for a<span class=""apple-converted-space""> </span><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">miracle</span>. Your donations will be used to help support my health issues in the following way:</span></p>
<p><span>1)      Travel costs to Shands hospital in Jacksonville,Florida for multiple visits and specific surgery from the team of doctors assigned.</span></p>
<p><span>2)      Medical costs for the doctor’s services on anything that would not be covered</span></p>
<p><span>3)       Caregiver assistance for my children during the 4-7 months downtime(I would need to hire a nanny as I don’t get much help with my children due to many reasons)</span></p>
<p><span>4)      Lodging expenses during the time period near the doctor’s offices for the timing in-between surgeries set.</span></p>
<p><span>5)      Bills accumulated at this time – See attached paperwork as I already received an eviction letter due to NO INCOME coming in to pay all of the bills. We received some donations from last fundraiser to help towards the bills but it only covered ¼ of them at this time!</span></p>
<p><span>6)      With recently obtaining shared cost Medicaid as insurance , some of the monies raised will be used for assistance in my monthly medication list and also any doctors that need funding before shared cost goal is met. We also have last months medical bills UNCOVERED at this time that will be paid for also.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><em><strong>** This is an updated fundraiser we are restarting due to us not meeting our previous goals. Currently to date we had a scheduled appointment on 8/14 @ Shands hospital that we used the previous funds for travel to meet with an assigned team of doctors on our case due to the intensity of the matter. We also found out ontop of the kinked bowel , the doctor performing a second physical found a large hernia (possibly two) set on the right side flank which is causing the increase in pain/elevated blood pressure scenario also. This is a HUGE find and the reason we set the fundraiser for the assistance to get a TEAM of doctors to find out the EXACT problem(s) and resolution to this alarming matter. I also had a SBS procedure done on 20<sup>th</sup> of July to get back the diagnosis of Crohn’s ontop of everything since I have had the pain start 3+ years ago, I am in the age range of this disease since it runs in my family history also. It is slowly developing but due to the anemia results + blood tests show the inflation is in my right side bowels and also affecting my Cecum too which is inflamed. Our next visit on the 28<sup>th</sup> of August will determine when the surgeons will operate to either remove some of the bowels to alleviate the pain somewhat or go from there. Attached you will find the denial letters I have received from the county to obtain assistance in help at this time and the 3 day notice of eviction I received today due to no money coming in. My attached letter shows me on bed rest due to my elevated blood pressure levels and I cannot do anything at this time, things are becoming serious!**//Some areas are blurred out for legal matters due to public media bindings that made my pain doctor/personal doctor discharge me due to this issue but the letters attached are as real as they come!</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong> </strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Our goals are around this rough ballpark at this time - Bedrest for 5-7 months from today and already it's been 3 months so approx 10 months of rent = $6500. Previous medical bills and co pays are around $4000 at this time due to shared cost insurance( the criteria met is $565 month in medical costs BEFORE it kicks in/does not include medications out of pocket seperately). Electric/Water for 5-7 months which is $2100 approx,travel to Tampa + Jacksonville at LEAST 3 more times scheduled $200-300 in travel costs and misc as needed. So roughly this time go around we need to raise $13000 + to be comfortable at this time, the previous bills are still lingering around so anything more than that would be used for them! This is an achievable goal that we can gain to by the supporting company helping with the fundraiser! Any questions please ask me in between surgeries or an admin assigned to the account. Thank you and GOD BLESS!</strong></em></p>

<p><span>Your help is greatly appreciated; me and my children have a lot of love to give. They have always been taught with manners, respect and to give better than receive. If you cannot donate for the cause, please share also! Use the fantastic sharing tools that Indiegogo has to offer. Sharing is the best love anyone can have and we have a lot of it. We appreciate anything that you have to offer by just being, yourself. Talking over with my children, we thought of many ways to pay the community with the funds we receive and would go as follows. We created a Facebook page due to the criticalness of my health for daily updates which your name would be placed as a memorabilia from helping us. Also higher donors would be compensated an autographed picture in the donating range stated above, last but not least a PERSONAL card/drawing from us to you, thanking for supporting us in this timing. We hope you enjoy the perks as I am always fascinated as the artistic incline my children provide in drawings to me, directly from their heart. Please keep in contact with me and the children, we love SUPPORT also! Thank you and God bless!</span></p>

My name is Donald Castellano, some know me by my nickname D.J. and here’s my story. Originally married in 1997 at the young age of 17 , over the course of 8 years being a father to five beautiful children I knew life would be full of adventure and hard work ahead to support these children. Working a single job still wasn’t enough to support the family, devastatingly only to end in a divorce in 2007 due to irreconcilable differences. Going our separate ways and allowing her to have the children fulltime while I worked, still getting nowhere in life, I decided to continue my education I originally started before my marriage in 1996.
                While attending school during the daytime (Criminal Justice degree), I also attended night time schooling on my days off (Business & Management degree) to complete it in 2009. I was super proud of finally getting somewhere in life ,being successful towards my children’s future and well being that I decided to take my Criminal Justice degree even further. Moving from one school to the next (due to capacity of finishing an A.S to a B.S.), I stayed steady pursuing my dreams of being a CSI Forensic Examiner for Department of Homeland Security. I knew I would be a big role model to my children, to look up to and wonder why I pursued what I did in matters of my family’s Law Enforcement history. To cherish and be passionate about everything I loved doing, serving the community, protecting their safety, teaching right from wrong while protecting the States from terrorist activities, to say the least, I was there.
                Till one day I got a phone call from my oldest daughter, Hailey’s teacher. Walking into the room I was in shock to see their Mothers new Mother-In-Law, teacher & State Case Worker all at the table. I was in awe, confused and distracted of my children being in harm’s way. The time I had spent trying to become a better father through education, paying my Child Support & becoming a better role model, was the time that they were being hurt… Physically, emotional and traumatically, the living conditions they were in were horrid. The reports were novels long, lice infested hair, loss of weight due to starvation, abuse marks found on them from the nurse but no notification to me from the school. Their mother had kept it all a secret only to fuel herself of addictive habits with the child support & food stamps she received from the State of Florida for over 2 ½ years. A change had to come, this couldn’t be happening to my children.
                With the help of the State of Florida, I was awarded FULL CUSTODY in Early 2010 of all FIVE children miraculously. Something rarely unheard of, being a REAL father and taking the stand of both role models with inspirational outlooks, I was in for a longer road ahead. Devastatingly that year, June 2010, I took two HUGE blows to my family. 1) We lost a most wonderful cousin, whom was a State Trooper for the State of New Jersey which in turn 2) Caused me to lose my job, of being on Bereavement, to return to work early since my mother flew to New Jersey instead of me. I was in shock, in denial that this was happening the way it was in such a moment in my life of turmoil and disbelief, it couldn’t be.
                I took charge, liquidating all of my assets, focusing on raising my children the correct way and getting them back on track since they missed quite a few months of schooling and some. I took a leave of absence with my Bachelors degree at my current University with only a year left, the children needed me the most at this critical timing of their lives.  Three of my children were left back that year in school; my oldest daughters THIRD time being left back almost in a row due to lack of education and attendance being her main problematic area. Additional tutoring after school from myself, additional therapists twice a week ordered for them , family group counseling with the six of us over the course of a couple years was in place and last but not least speech therapy for two of my children due to problematic issues while growing up that was not addressed. They were progressing, F’s,D’s to C’s and up to their current point now of being Honor Roll students, the hard work was paying off. They were creative, developing stories for school that were amazing, awards brought home for best effort and dedication in anything they did, it was a priceless.
                Around the middle of 2011, I started becoming fatigued and in pain. Already bearing a single solitary kidney, always taking good care of my health already, something was wrong for this to happen. I went to my Primary Health Physician to be immediately rushed to the hospital due to high blood pressure. 200+/150+ at first it started… The pain was unbearable; they placed me on one blood pressure medication, only to temporarily work while figuring out what’s going on. Going to a Urologist, Nephrologist to Gastrologist, test after test, it seemed hopeless for a few months. Within a six month time period my Primary Care Physician placed me on 3 different types of blood pressure medications only to refer me to a pain clinic, since the blood pressure medications weren’t totally fixing the problem. Attending the Pain Clinic, I was originally placed on powerful Morphine doses twice a day with another pain medicine in between to resolve my problem from the pain that proceeded to start. 5 medications in total it took for my blood pressure to come back to somewhat a normal range and out of the stroke(or even death) levels they were at for months straight on end.
                I thought it was over, 6 months straight of tests and no resolution but medications that I would have to take for possibly the rest of my life, only being 31 now, it would be a long time. I had already visited the E.R. 17 times at this point, becoming frequent even with the Doctors in the Emergency section alone! Finally finding out what was going on, my Gastrologist had the results. February 2012 I had undergone a Colonoscopy to find out I had a tight, kinked bowel at the hepatic flexure with possible hernia(s) also developing. This was serious, the tests I have been through and also finding out I have kidney stones again (Third time in 10 months) the pain totally is almost indescribable.  2 months into taking the morphine my blood pressure started rising again, 5 medications later and still no permanent resolution, I returned back to my Primary Care once again. 
                Upon multiple visits and tests again with the new specialist, the doctor declined to do surgery as a resolution on this matter.The rarity of my single kidney was causing my bowels to shift towards the right causing the very painful kink currently there at this moment. I don’t smoke, drink or use drugs but still stated due to the onset of the illness it was more of a risk then benefit.Too much of a “Maybe” was the results of everything and from the inconsistency of the problem the responsibility of surgeon,it was too much of a liability for a single doctor to handle this.
               This is where we are today, the present day and why I ask for your help. I am in desperate need for assistance so I can get back to doing what I do best, raising my children. I am sick and tired of being sick and tired, there has to be hope out to the public. I have no insurance,noone else to care for my children and therefore it seems where I need to be is what I cannot afford. I have given everything I earned since my childhood to my children, to help them be where they are today only to be stuck at a dead end with my health at a steady declining rate. I have nothing left to give to proceed at this point, so I am hoping for a miracle. Your donations will be used to help support my health issues in the following way:
1)      Travel costs to Shands hospital in Jacksonville,Florida for multiple visits and specific surgery from the team of doctors assigned.
2)      Medical costs for the doctor’s services on anything that would not be covered
3)       Caregiver assistance for my children during the 4-7 months downtime(I would need to hire a nanny as I don’t get much help with my children due to many reasons)
4)      Lodging expenses during the time period near the doctor’s offices for the timing in-between surgeries set.
5)      Bills accumulated at this time – See attached paperwork as I already received an eviction letter due to NO INCOME coming in to pay all of the bills. We received some donations from last fundraiser to help towards the bills but it only covered ¼ of them at this time!
6)      With recently obtaining shared cost Medicaid as insurance , some of the monies raised will be used for assistance in my monthly medication list and also any doctors that need funding before shared cost goal is met. We also have last months medical bills UNCOVERED at this time that will be paid for also.
 
** This is an updated fundraiser we are restarting due to us not meeting our previous goals. Currently to date we had a scheduled appointment on 8/14 @ Shands hospital that we used the previous funds for travel to meet with an assigned team of doctors on our case due to the intensity of the matter. We also found out ontop of the kinked bowel , the doctor performing a second physical found a large hernia (possibly two) set on the right side flank which is causing the increase in pain/elevated blood pressure scenario also. This is a HUGE find and the reason we set the fundraiser for the assistance to get a TEAM of doctors to find out the EXACT problem(s) and resolution to this alarming matter. I also had a SBS procedure done on 20th of July to get back the diagnosis of Crohn’s ontop of everything since I have had the pain start 3+ years ago, I am in the age range of this disease since it runs in my family history also. It is slowly developing but due to the anemia results + blood tests show the inflation is in my right side bowels and also affecting my Cecum too which is inflamed. Our next visit on the 28th of August will determine when the surgeons will operate to either remove some of the bowels to alleviate the pain somewhat or go from there. Attached you will find the denial letters I have received from the county to obtain assistance in help at this time and the 3 day notice of eviction I received today due to no money coming in. My attached letter shows me on bed rest due to my elevated blood pressure levels and I cannot do anything at this time, things are becoming serious!**//Some areas are blurred out for legal matters due to public media bindings that made my pain doctor/personal doctor discharge me due to this issue but the letters attached are as real as they come!
 
Our goals are around this rough ballpark at this time - Bedrest for 5-7 months from today and already it's been 3 months so approx 10 months of rent = $6500. Previous medical bills and co pays are around $4000 at this time due to shared cost insurance( the criteria met is $565 month in medical costs BEFORE it kicks in/does not include medications out of pocket seperately). Electric/Water for 5-7 months which is $2100 approx,travel to Tampa + Jacksonville at LEAST 3 more times scheduled $200-300 in travel costs and misc as needed. So roughly this time go around we need to raise $13000 + to be comfortable at this time, the previous bills are still lingering around so anything more than that would be used for them! This is an achievable goal that we can gain to by the supporting company helping with the fundraiser! Any questions please ask me in between surgeries or an admin assigned to the account. Thank you and GOD BLESS!
 
 
 
Your help is greatly appreciated; me and my children have a lot of love to give. They have always been taught with manners, respect and to give better than receive. If you cannot donate for the cause, please share also! Use the fantastic sharing tools that Indiegogo has to offer. Sharing is the best love anyone can have and we have a lot of it. We appreciate anything that you have to offer by just being, yourself. Talking over with my children, we thought of many ways to pay the community with the funds we receive and would go as follows. We created a Facebook page due to the criticalness of my health for daily updates which your name would be placed as a memorabilia from helping us. Also higher donors would be compensated an autographed picture in the donating range stated above, last but not least a PERSONAL card/drawing from us to you, thanking for supporting us in this timing. We hope you enjoy the perks as I am always fascinated as the artistic incline my children provide in drawings to me, directly from their heart. Please keep in contact with me and the children, we love SUPPORT also! Thank you and God bless!

<p><b>September 5, 2013 Update:</b> I am completely overwhelmed by the outpouring of support this campaign has received. I reached my funding goal in 2 days. Thank you all so much - words can't express my gratitude. Anything raised over my initial goal will go to further transition healthcare costs. This medical care is expensive, and this fundraiser was originally set up to cover only specific portions of what I pay. Any help beyond the initial $2000 is incredibly appreciated and makes a big difference. This financial support takes a huge weight off my shoulders and means I can access the healthcare I need. Thank you thank you thank you.</p>

<p>My name is Jos Truitt, I'm a writer, Editor at <a href=""http://Feministing.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://feministing.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Feministing.com</a>, speaker, consultant, printmaker, baking enthusiast, and also a trans woman. I've started this fundraising page because I need help paying for expensive healthcare that's part of my transition and that's not covered by insurance.</p>
<p>I am currently undergoing $1,000 worth of laser hair removal. While I have been out for years now, hair removal has often been financially inaccessible to me. I was also screwed over by one laser company that stole money from a lot of clients. I have spent well over this $1,000 on hair removal, but this round of laser will go a long way to making me much more comfortable existing in public. I have very dark facial hair that's hard to hide and makes me feel like a target because it undermines my intended gender presentation. Unfortunately, hair removal is not considered necessary medical care for me and is not covered by insurance. With your help I will be able to complete this important part of my healthcare.</p>
<p>I am also going through another aspect of my transition that also costs $1,000. I am less comfortable discussing this part of my care in public, but it is also necessary medical care that is also not covered by insurance. </p>
<p>I am uncomfortable with the current trans fundraising paradigm, including for reasons <a href=""http://janetmock.tumblr.com/post/51807554795/kokumo-jabriel-fundraising"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Janet Mock outlined in this great post</a>. Fundraising works best for folks who are part of a network of people with money, which, given systemic inequalities, means it's mostly a successful approach for white trans folks from relatively class privileged communities. Additionally, individual fundraising does nothing to advance the cause of making trans healthcare accessible for all. It is a temporary fix and drain on our communities in the face of systemic inequality. Yet I have to reconcile these facts with the reality that I need help, now. That's why I'd like to ask that anyone who donates to this fundraiser consider a matching donation to an organization that works for justice for the trans community. I suggest sending matching donations to Transgender Gender Variant Intersex Justice Project (TGIJP), which focuses on the needs of trans, gender non-conforming, and intersex people of color who are caught up in the prison system. So for example, if you give me a $20 donation, please also consider <a href=""http://www.tgijp.org/contribute.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">donating $20 to TGIJP here</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help and support. It means the world to me.</p>

<h3>About my Grade 1 Teacher</h3>
<p>Chuchi was my Grade 1 Teacher. She was an elementary school teacher for over 30 years and had touched many lives with her passionate approach to educate children. With 4 children of her own to raise, a husband to take care of, she had been a good example to her peers and has always shown compassion to her family's needs. On July 18, 2013, at the age of 59, she was found unconscious and had cardiac arrest. She was also diagnosed to have had TB and pneumonia. After 1 Pulmonologist, 1 Neurologist, 1 Cardiologist, 1 Internist, 2 Surgeons (1 for her Tracheostomy and 1 for her Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy operation), and over 2 months in Intensive Care Unit, she was still unconscious leaving her family a hospital bill of 1 Million Philippine Pesos (23,200 USD) . On September 28, 2013, she was released to her family for home care citing severe brain damage with very poor chances of recovery as seen in her latest EEG result. She is currently in a stupor state of consciousness and is being taken care by a caregiver with occasional laboratory tests and visits by doctor who specializes home care.</p>

Chuchi was my Grade 1 Teacher. She was an elementary school teacher for over 30 years and had touched many lives with her passionate approach to educate children. With 4 children of her own to raise, a husband to take care of, she had been a good example to her peers and has always shown compassion to her family's needs. On July 18, 2013, at the age of 59, she was found unconscious and had cardiac arrest. She was also diagnosed to have had TB and pneumonia. After 1 Pulmonologist, 1 Neurologist, 1 Cardiologist, 1 Internist, 2 Surgeons (1 for her Tracheostomy and 1 for her Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy operation), and over 2 months in Intensive Care Unit, she was still unconscious leaving her family a hospital bill of 1 Million Philippine Pesos (23,200 USD) . On September 28, 2013, she was released to her family for home care citing severe brain damage with very poor chances of recovery as seen in her latest EEG result. She is currently in a stupor state of consciousness and is being taken care by a caregiver with occasional laboratory tests and visits by doctor who specializes home care.


With her grandson, Gab.

<h2>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Efficiency of</b></span><b> Inhalation</b>
</h2>90% of the air we breathe in goes into our nasal passage and the rest of the 10% via our mouth. <b><i>Inhalation is the best &amp; fastest way to stimulate the neurons in the body</i></b> as compared to other methods such as absorption &amp; ingestion. The ‘Olfactory receptors’ sitting inside our nose that is responsible for transmitting the scent molecule directly to our brain.<br/>A simple experiment to indicate this is just simply drinking lemon juice while pinching your nose. You will eventually only get a weak sour as compared to drinking lemon juice normally. The tongue collaborates with the nose to bind together the taste &amp; smell of lemon.</div>
<h3><b>How Scent works?</b></h3>
<p>As the brain is known as the 'central nervous system' consisting of the brain &amp; the spinal cord. It integrates information it receives from &amp; coordinates. It also influence the activity of all parts of the body. That is why scent plays an important role in influencing someone well being as it ts open to therapeutic treatments.</p>

</div><div>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Back in the olden days, apothecaries or natural pharmacies in Asia formulated several natural herbs put together in sachets for people as a form of remedy to aid nasal &amp; breathing problems.

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">As time goes by, herbalist started curating more exciting &amp; intricate blend of aromatic scent.

 MOOD + FOCUS EnhancerZero Degree: Aromatic Herbal Inhaler  is an all-natural, award-winning portable aromatherapy on the go that provides a refreshing & cool sensation to revitalize the body & mind. Inspired by traditional herbal remedies.As Featured on All Natural IngredientsZero Degree: Aromatic Herbal Inhaler is a modern day twist of aromatherapy. It is clinically proven by FDA and safe for use. Embody with a modern aromatic blend of soothing cool mint scent that has this clean & balance composition of Eucalyptus oil and also other exciting mix of natural herbs to give the Zero Degree its distinctive scent that is totally unique.   How can Zero Degree help you It is important to understand the science of how human body works. By doing so our collaborators and us carefully engineered the best possible formula that could tackle some of the daily encounters that people face daily. We carefully consolidate several herbs together that would combine to become not only a scent, but a therapeutic scent that can engage and aid the body. The benefits of what Zero Degree could do as illustrate in the infographics chart below. As and when its needed!These are some of the situations we might face everyday. Situations that present itself unexpectedly in today's fast pace society. Then we see how society turns to alternatives that do not address the problem. Zero Degree might be the answer to your daily needs. How to use ZERO DEGREESimply twist the inhaler, inhale deeply the aromatic herbal scent and you are ready to continue whatever you left off with a refreshing start. Clinical Aromatherapy


Aromatherapy is arguably the most fundamental approach of therapeutic methods. It is also one of the simplest way to integrate because when we inhale air, we simultaneously inhale aroma.


Efficiency of Inhalation
90% of the air we breathe in goes into our nasal passage and the rest of the 10% via our mouth. Inhalation is the best & fastest way to stimulate the neurons in the body as compared to other methods such as absorption & ingestion. The ‘Olfactory receptors’ sitting inside our nose that is responsible for transmitting the scent molecule directly to our brain.A simple experiment to indicate this is just simply drinking lemon juice while pinching your nose. You will eventually only get a weak sour as compared to drinking lemon juice normally. The tongue collaborates with the nose to bind together the taste & smell of lemon.
How Scent works?
As the brain is known as the 'central nervous system' consisting of the brain & the spinal cord. It integrates information it receives from & coordinates. It also influence the activity of all parts of the body. That is why scent plays an important role in influencing someone well being as it ts open to therapeutic treatments.

How Zero Degree came about

Back in the olden days, apothecaries or natural pharmacies in Asia formulated several natural herbs put together in sachets for people as a form of remedy to aid nasal & breathing problems. They later also discovered that the same herbal sachets provides them mental acuity & focus which gives them the extra boost they needed to perform their physical jobs.

As time goes by, herbalist started curating more exciting & intricate blend of aromatic scent. They started blending natural herbs with essential oils. That's when the glass jar came about. So we want to take the ancient practice of aromatherapy to the next level. Therefore our journey to great innovation start from here...
We have gone through a very thorough process to come out with Zero Degree. We search high & low for the top notch experts to provide us with the best solution for our product, be it at design or our formula. We ran into lots of organisations, companies, freelancers, and more to find the most suitable & reliable collaborators to work with. We spent almost 3 years going through this painstaking process so as to uphold quality.Formulating Zero Degree

Creating our scent profile was one of the challenges that we face. We want to formulate a blend that has character. A recognisable fresh and clean scent that is rich yet contemporary to suit the modern day people. 

We took some time off to understand the fundamentals of botany and how the whole process from how plantation works to harvesting and formulation. We were amazed of the endless benefits of what these natural herbs can help us with our daily life. We then went on to further study various different types of botanical sources of oils and herbs with different types of benefit.

For ensuring the best quality, we had gone through FDA for certification & intensive testing to make sure is safe to use.

Design & Development
Market Research & Analysis
We design the inhaler with the objective of understanding what our users require. We begin the design process by doing some market research & analysis. We brainstorm, conceptualise several designs and streamlined it to the finest and most refine design ever.
Concept & Design

The concept behind Zero Degree is a one piece design construction. We want it to be non-detachable product so as to stay minimal and to prevent any missing cap issue. Importantly it has to be brilliant, stylish & simple to use. 

With a simple twist, air from outside then enters the chambers through the openings located at the back of the inhaler & flow past its unique blend of herbal extracts. It will let the scent waft up through the top openings.


Testing & Prototyping

We’ve done tremendous amount of testing to come up with the best design with numerous prototypes to give the ‘Zero Degree’ inhaler the right proportion, contour, colour, function & importantly an holistic experience for the user. 

Aromatherapy on the go

We designed Zero Degree with the intention of having it portable so as to benefit the user of carrying it anywhere. Portability is one of our priority when designing the Zero Degree. We look into several situations and environments such as in a crowded bus, office spaces, intervals of gym time, or probably cycling at the park. How this aromatherapy on the go is cater to the lifestyle of the modern people.

We’re back again (this time as a registered tax exempt 501c3 charity) with slightly loftier goals....<br/><br/><b>ORPHAN STUDENTS in RWANDA:</b><br/>It’s been a busy year for We Are Limitless (WAL). We have grown from our initial 3 students to sponsoring 23 orphaned children in primary, secondary, and University. WAL provides all of them with tuition, room &amp; board, medical insurance, clothing, and just about anything a child would need to get them through life. <br/><br/>During the June visit to Rwanda we promised 6 more students to bring them into the WAL family by year’s end. The trip also allowed Matt to check in on most of the children personally, to assess their individual challenges and needs and further one of <b>WAL's primary initiatives -</b> <b>To encourage critical thinking and independent thought. </b><br/><br/>It was exciting to see that many students have exceeded our projections. Though a few others have been having some difficulties adjusting to the structure and workload of their boarding schools. That said, there are some individual stories that are worth mentioning. Marie, an 8yr old in Primary school, who began studying at Maranatha School in January, just ranked first in her class of 42 in last semesters final exams. The private tutor we hired for Jean Paul has begun paying dividends and his grades have gone up for the past two semesters. Emmanuel G. (We have 3 students named Emmanuel)  is our first University student to graduate and, with the help of WAL, will be starting his accounting internship this September.<br/><p></p><p></p><b>WAL and THE CONGO:</b><br/>The trip also included traveling across the border to the war torn Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to visit our friend Augustin Twagara who, with his Centre D’Education A La Non Violence (CENOVI), is helping orphans and women of sexual abuse in that country. With estimates as high as 8 million people killed in the conflicts that have engulfed Congo since 1996, there are now 800,000 orphans living in the country. DRC also has an insanely high number of victims of rape with 1,100 women raped there every day.<br/><br/>Matt spent time at two of Augustin’s sites where they are caring for over 200 children and women who have no place to go. In one site he visited 76 children aged 2-14 who were crammed into a 275 sq foot wood hut with a dirt floor where they literally slept on top of each other. The following day he had lunch with a young woman named Yvette who told her story of how she was awakened in the middle of the night by soldiers who raided her home, killed her father, and raped her and her younger sister. With nowhere to go she found her way to Augustin’s group and they have been doing what they can to help her get back on her feet.<br/><p></p><p>Given only one meal of beans and rice a day, these women and children are in desperate need of proper food and shelter as well as an opportunity for an education. This is where WAL is looking to help by teaming with CENOVI on a new project in Congo. All funds over $15,000 raised on this campaign (as well as 70 percent of the money raised at the Annual Celebrity Poker Tournament) will go towards building a facility in Goma city, DRC to house these women and children, provide them with counseling, medical attention, work training, and preparation to attend school.

<p>This January, Amaha Girma will walk 430 km from Addis Ababa to a village
called Ganzilla to raise $25,000. If he meets his goal, 2,200 people will have access to clean
water for the first time in their lives. This will be the first fundraising walk ever held in
Ethiopia. <br/></p>
<p>Amaha works as a driver in Addis Ababa,
Ethiopia. While he certainly isn’t a wealthy man, he gives more to his local
community than many people do in a lifetime. <span><a href=""http://hayo.co/addis-ababa-driver-became-entrepreneur-success/?hvid=45fFpQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">You can read more about Amaha and his community projects here. </a></span></p>
<p>Amaha discovered the community of Ganzilla earlier
this year while working for a Canadian NGO called <a href=""http://www.imagine1day.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">imagine1day</a>. <br/></p>
<p>Although Ganzilla is in the highlands of the Bale Zone,
where it rains almost six months a year, this village has no access to clean water—the ground water is simply too deep to dig a well.
Residents walk three kilometers to fetch water each day from a nearby stream
surrounded by farmland and cattle.</p>
<p>As a result, kids keep getting sick. When Amaha was in Ganzilla, he saw a girl with a large potbelly. He brought her
to a doctor in the nearest town, and they found 35 parasites
living in her tiny body. The doctor came back to the village with Amaha and found another
80 kids with parasites. <br/></p>
<p>Today, thanks largely to Amaha, children in Ganzilla are taught
basic hygiene and instructed on the importance of boiling water before they use
it. Still, each time he returns to the village, more children are sick. <br/></p>
<p>As a father of three (with one more on the way!), Amaha couldn’t stand by doing
nothing, so he decided to embark on this Walk for Water.<br/></p>
<p>Please sponsor Amaha on his walk. With a small contribution,
you have the power to help more than 2,200 children and villagers live
healthier, happier lives. </p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>Before Amaha decided to embark on this Walk for
Water, he met with the Water Office in the district of Sinana where the village
of <span>Ganzilla is located. The
Water Office has found a natural spring near Ganzilla that could be developed
for just 500,000 birr ($25,000). </span></p>
<p>Amaha is
currently asking people to sponsor kilometers of his walk. <span>So far, he has already raised
60,000 birr ($3,000) with local support. <br/></span></p>
<p>When Amaha completes his walk in January, he will
arrive to the village of Ganzilla with 12 doctors from Robe, the nearest town,
who have volunteered to give treatments to all the children who are sick.
Meanwhile, the district of Sinana, where Ganzilla is located, has committed to
completing the development of the natural spring within one month of receiving
the funds. </p>
<p>If Amaha exceeds his goal, the excess funds will be
used to purchase oxen for the community. These will be fattened and sold at
profit, allowing the community to independently maintain their school and water development in the months and years to come. </p>
<p>If crowd funding does not allow Amaha to meet his
goal, he will seek out partnerships with local NGOs to meet the funding gap. <b>The money you donated will only be withdrawn when there is enough money to develop the natural spring. </b>It will not be spent on any other projects (except for cattle fattening as mentioned above, if the goal is exceeded).<br/></p>
<p>All supporters of Amaha’s Walk for Water will
receive email updates and photos before and after Amaha’s walk, and an update
from the community when the well is built.</p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>Ethiopia has one of the lowest rates of
clean water and sanitation access in Sub-Saharan Africa and the world. </p>
<p>In Ganzilla, women and girls spend
hours each day walking to the nearest stream only to collect dirty water that makes
people sick. Water born diseases are having a significant impact on student enrollment
and attendance. Even when children do attend classes, if they aren’t well
hydrated, they get dizzy and fall asleep. Meanwhile, overall community
production in the fields is also suffering. </p>
<p>When someone does get sick, they must travel 37 km
to Robe, the nearest town, to get medical treatment. With no vehicle, the
journey takes three to four hours on foot. </p>
<p>Having access to a clean source of water in the village will have a dramatic impact
on the women and girls of Ganzilla, who are responsible for fetching water. The
entire community will also benefit from improved health and productivity.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p><b>Amaha’s
Walk for Water faces three main risks and challenges: </b></p>
<p><span>1.<span>  </span></span><b>Amaha could get sick or injured during
the trip. </b>To ensure that Amaha reaches Ganzilla safely, the

</div></div>","Short Summary 
This January, Amaha Girma will walk 430 km from Addis Ababa to a village
called Ganzilla to raise $25,000. If he meets his goal, 2,200 people will have access to clean
water for the first time in their lives. This will be the first fundraising walk ever held in
Ethiopia. 
Amaha works as a driver in Addis Ababa,
Ethiopia. While he certainly isn’t a wealthy man, he gives more to his local
community than many people do in a lifetime. You can read more about Amaha and his community projects here. 
Amaha discovered the community of Ganzilla earlier
this year while working for a Canadian NGO called imagine1day. 
Although Ganzilla is in the highlands of the Bale Zone,
where it rains almost six months a year, this village has no access to clean water—the ground water is simply too deep to dig a well.
Residents walk three kilometers to fetch water each day from a nearby stream
surrounded by farmland and cattle.
As a result, kids keep getting sick. When Amaha was in Ganzilla, he saw a girl with a large potbelly. He brought her
to a doctor in the nearest town, and they found 35 parasites
living in her tiny body. The doctor came back to the village with Amaha and found another
80 kids with parasites. 
Today, thanks largely to Amaha, children in Ganzilla are taught
basic hygiene and instructed on the importance of boiling water before they use
it. Still, each time he returns to the village, more children are sick. 
As a father of three (with one more on the way!), Amaha couldn’t stand by doing
nothing, so he decided to embark on this Walk for Water.
Please sponsor Amaha on his walk. With a small contribution,
you have the power to help more than 2,200 children and villagers live
healthier, happier lives. 
   What We Need & What You Get 
Before Amaha decided to embark on this Walk for
Water, he met with the Water Office in the district of Sinana where the village
of Ganzilla is located. The
Water Office has found a natural spring near Ganzilla that could be developed
for just 500,000 birr ($25,000). 
Amaha is
currently asking people to sponsor kilometers of his walk. So far, he has already raised
60,000 birr ($3,000) with local support. 
When Amaha completes his walk in January, he will
arrive to the village of Ganzilla with 12 doctors from Robe, the nearest town,
who have volunteered to give treatments to all the children who are sick.
Meanwhile, the district of Sinana, where Ganzilla is located, has committed to
completing the development of the natural spring within one month of receiving
the funds. 
If Amaha exceeds his goal, the excess funds will be
used to purchase oxen for the community. These will be fattened and sold at
profit, allowing the community to independently maintain their school and water development in the months and years to come. 
If crowd funding does not allow Amaha to meet his
goal, he will seek out partnerships with local NGOs to meet the funding gap. The money you donated will only be withdrawn when there is enough money to develop the natural spring. It will not be spent on any other projects (except for cattle fattening as mentioned above, if the goal is exceeded).
All supporters of Amaha’s Walk for Water will
receive email updates and photos before and after Amaha’s walk, and an update
from the community when the well is built.   The Impact 
Ethiopia has one of the lowest rates of
clean water and sanitation access in Sub-Saharan Africa and the world. 
In Ganzilla, women and girls spend
hours each day walking to the nearest stream only to collect dirty water that makes
people sick. Water born diseases are having a significant impact on student enrollment
and attendance. Even when children do attend classes, if they aren’t well
hydrated, they get dizzy and fall asleep. Meanwhile, overall community
production in the fields is also suffering. 
When someone does get sick, they must travel 37 km
to Robe, the nearest town, to get medical treatment. With no vehicle, the
journey takes three to four hours on foot. 
Having access to a clean source of water in the village will have a dramatic impact
on the women and girls of Ganzilla, who are responsible for fetching water. The
entire community will also benefit from improved health and productivity.   Risks & Challenges  
Amaha’s
Walk for Water faces three main risks and challenges: 
1.  Amaha could get sick or injured during
the trip. To ensure that Amaha reaches Ganzilla safely, the
Sinana district government and local charities working in the sector have
committed to assisting Amaha during his walk. They will assign a car to follow
Amaha during his entire journey. 
2.  Amaha may not reach his $25,000 goal. If Amaha
does not meet his goal by January through crowd funding, he will begin asking
local charities working in the region to provide matching funding. Any funds
raised through crowd funding will remain in the bank account
set up for this campaign until the goal is met. 
3.  You may not trust him. To ensure
accountability in all his fundraising efforts, Amaha will collect no cash during
his campaign. Instead, Amaha set up a bank account dedicated to the water
project that requires five signatures to approve any withdrawal. A government
official from the district of Sinana, three community members from Ganzilla
village, and a staff member from imagine1day (the NGO Amaha works for), all
have to sign their approval before money is removed from the account. People
can only contribute by making direct deposits into this account, and money will
only be removed when the $25,000 goal is met.

 Ghana University Chapters (UCC, Legon, KNUST and MUCG) have decided to 
volunteer 1 to 2weeks of their summer long vacation every year to 
provide support for one of the poorest communities in Ghana and help 
them with some basic needs including social amenities.</p>
<p>Patriots Ghana is a registered non-profit non-governmental 
organization that seeks to develop, encourage and empower Ghanaian 
citizens and organizations to undertake community services geared 
towards national development. Jei Krodua -Yamoah Nkwanta, the town 
selected is in the Awutu Senya District that’s in the Central Region of 
Ghana.</p>
<p>The village has a population of about (800) eight hundred and 
currently lacks access to any basic social amenity. Though there are 
several challenges or needs, one of the most pressing needs of the 
community is access to portable water. The locals currently resort to a 
stagnant water source for their domestic activities and it has the 
potential of enhancing water borne diseases.</p>
<p>The government of Ghana under the Sustainable Rural Water and 
Sanitation project sponsored by the World Bank (WB) drilled a borehole 
for the community and other nine others in the district. Unfortunately, 
funding for the project seized and the constructors halted the project 
since 2008, but had finished with the drilling. Addition to this 
challenge the community also lacks a toilet facility and further 
enhancing the potential for increased water borne diseases.</p><p>(Borehole Under construction)<br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/765834/files/20140804124001-DSCN3648.jpg?1407181201"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>According to the health records in the district, most of the health 
cases from this community and its environs are as a result of poor and 
bad water sources. The nonexistence of a health facility also makes it 
impossible for the community to handle some of these health problems 
resulting from contaminated water source. Children who have been sick

Cover letter from District Chief Executive<br/></a><p></p></div>","Patriots
 Ghana University Chapters (UCC, Legon, KNUST and MUCG) have decided to 
volunteer 1 to 2weeks of their summer long vacation every year to 
provide support for one of the poorest communities in Ghana and help 
them with some basic needs including social amenities.
Patriots Ghana is a registered non-profit non-governmental 
organization that seeks to develop, encourage and empower Ghanaian 
citizens and organizations to undertake community services geared 
towards national development. Jei Krodua -Yamoah Nkwanta, the town 
selected is in the Awutu Senya District that’s in the Central Region of 
Ghana.
The village has a population of about (800) eight hundred and 
currently lacks access to any basic social amenity. Though there are 
several challenges or needs, one of the most pressing needs of the 
community is access to portable water. The locals currently resort to a 
stagnant water source for their domestic activities and it has the 
potential of enhancing water borne diseases.
The government of Ghana under the Sustainable Rural Water and 
Sanitation project sponsored by the World Bank (WB) drilled a borehole 
for the community and other nine others in the district. Unfortunately, 
funding for the project seized and the constructors halted the project 
since 2008, but had finished with the drilling. Addition to this 
challenge the community also lacks a toilet facility and further 
enhancing the potential for increased water borne diseases.(Borehole Under construction)
According to the health records in the district, most of the health 
cases from this community and its environs are as a result of poor and 
bad water sources. The nonexistence of a health facility also makes it 
impossible for the community to handle some of these health problems 
resulting from contaminated water source. Children who have been sick 
and drop out of schools due to contaminated water and basic health 
issues is increasing and has resulted in increased school dropout rate.
This has become a great need and why Patriots Ghana University 
Chapters has decided to help provide a source of Potable water for the 
Yamoah Nkwanta Village. Aside that they would be offering free teaching 
and evening classes to the children in the village to help improve their
 academic performance and also engage the whole community in public 
health education on various health issues especially those that are 
related to sanitation and hygiene.
The Patriots team has visited the village on several occasions to do a
 feasibility study, officially meet the chiefs and community leaders, 
and interact with the locals to identify the problems of the community 
and how best they can be solved. The team has also made an official 
visit to the District Chief Executive of the district, Lieutenant Daniel
 Osardu (Retired) and has received approval and the support of his high 
office.
Patriots 
Ghana is soliciting for support financially, materially or any kind of 
assistance so we can provide the community with this basic need and 
solve the problems that are associated with the lack of these social 
amenities.

been anxious to know how much support each of these eight candidates have among
Winnipeggers. The most recent public polls were conducted more than six months

these surveys – many of which use questionable methodologies and/or do not

</h2><p>Golf has a big problem. Over the last 10 years in the US alone, 20% of recreational golfers have stopped playing. That's over 5 million people! 18 to 36 year-olds aren't picking up the game and they certainly aren't watching the pros on TV.</p><p>The reasons are well documented. Millennials think golf is:</p><ul>
<li>too slow </li>
<li>too quiet<br/>
</li>
<li>too conservative<br/>
</li>
<li>too expensive </li>
<li>too difficult to learn<br/>

 love playing golf, but find it boring to watch. We also enjoy

<b>Q: Is this a family friendly event? </b><br/>A: YES! We would love for you to bring your children to this event and get them excited about RippedLinks and the sport of golf!<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Q: What safety precautions are you taking with regards to golf balls flying over the crowd?</b><br/>A: As awesome as a RippedLinks competition event will be, fan and player safety is of primary importance to us. Although our players are elite level golfers, we realize they are human and may hit a bad shot from an elevated tee. We will have our fans positioned safely while our players hit their 100-120 yard long tee shots. During our course planning and design, we will determine if protective netting is required in strategic locations. Another important point is that we are not hitting 300 yard, 150 mph drives like on the PGA Tour. Our gameplay requires only high, lofted approach shots traveling at a fraction of the velocity generated with a driver.<br/><br/>

<p></p><p></p></div>","What is RippedLinks? 
Golf has a big problem. Over the last 10 years in the US alone, 20% of recreational golfers have stopped playing. That's over 5 million people! 18 to 36 year-olds aren't picking up the game and they certainly aren't watching the pros on TV.The reasons are well documented. Millennials think golf is:
too slow 
too quiet

too conservative

too expensive 
too difficult to learn

and has way too many complicated rules
In other words, most young people think golf is lame. A game mostly played by retired people and millionaire tour professionals.We are Philip Davis and Colin Weston, co-founders of RippedLinks. While watching sports in a Vancouver pub over two years ago, we asked 
ourselves, ""Why can't golf be more like the X-Games?"" We
 love playing golf, but find it boring to watch. We also enjoy 
snowboarding, surfing and skateboarding, so the idea of combining 
elements from each of these sports comes naturally for us. So rather 
than complain about how underwhelming the golf viewing experience is, we
 decided to create something better.With RippedLinks, we have created a competitive tour format that is fast, fun and loud, combining the energy and atmosphere of an action sport event with the best aspects of golf.Our plan is to create a North American RippedLinks Tour to 4 to 6 cities, but first we need to stage a demonstration event to validate the concept to potential fans, investors, sponsors and broadcasters, while building our brand and creating buzz.Imagine golf. Now have the players tee off from an elevated tower while DJs spin live music and our announcer calls the action. Drop in motorized longboard riding from the tower base to the green while a loud and excited crowd cheers the players on. THAT is RippedLinks.What the press is saying about us...Sports Illustrated/Golf.com January 2014 article ""RippedLinks: Golf Gone Wild""
http://www.golf.com/tour-and-news/golf-gone-wild-rippedlinks-combines-golf-and-extreme-sports-younger-audience
  The April issues of Golf Canada and Chill magazines printed an article on RippedLinks titled ""Golf Deconstructed"". http://ow.ly/wAUEV
Back9Network article about our vision to create a golf format that appeals to a younger audience: http://www.back9network.com/article/xgames-and-golf-collide-with-rippedlinks/

The game and player stats will be updated throughout the live event to ensure our audience is fully engaged in the RippedLinks experience.This graphic shows how the 3 to 4 hour September 7th 2014 event will play out:This Is Where YOU Come In.

<p>Airoboom is a smoking device designed to help people to smoke marijuana in
an easier and healthier way. It uses water filter that is known to be the
best filter to reduce the toxins we inhale while smoking.</p>
<p>The Airoboom was designed for easier smoking, so the whole smoking part is
done by the device itself, so your lung doesn’t make an effort to burn the
marijuana.<br/>
It is very smooth to inhale, yet very powerful.<br/>
We designed it from few different components so it will be easier to clean.each
and one of the parts is easily replaceable.<br/>
It is easy for storing and for traveling, since it can be shorten to 8 Cm
Height.<br/>
And It can contain 1 litre of concentrated THC air.</p>
<p><b><u>How does it work?</u></b></p>
<p>The Airoboom use simple physics.<br/>
The entire process of smoking is done by the vacuum that is created when you
lift the Airopump upwards.<br/>
All you need to do, is fill up water in the bottom part. (It can be smoked
without water, However it is highly recommended to use the water filter)<br/>
Put the Marijuana in the tube and burn it,<br/>
while you start to burn it, lift up the AiroPump slowly till the top.<br/>
Once the Airoboom is full with smoke, put your lips on the tube and press the
AiroPump down.The smoke will run through the tube straight to your body.<br/>
The effect is very strong, and the inhaling is very smooth.</p>
<p>It’s a new kind of high, that only Airoboom can provide, its just feels

<br/><p></p></div>","What is Airoboom?
Airoboom is a smoking device designed to help people to smoke marijuana in
an easier and healthier way. It uses water filter that is known to be the
best filter to reduce the toxins we inhale while smoking.
The Airoboom was designed for easier smoking, so the whole smoking part is
done by the device itself, so your lung doesn’t make an effort to burn the
marijuana.
It is very smooth to inhale, yet very powerful.
We designed it from few different components so it will be easier to clean.each
and one of the parts is easily replaceable.
It is easy for storing and for traveling, since it can be shorten to 8 Cm
Height.
And It can contain 1 litre of concentrated THC air.
How does it work?
The Airoboom use simple physics.
The entire process of smoking is done by the vacuum that is created when you
lift the Airopump upwards.
All you need to do, is fill up water in the bottom part. (It can be smoked
without water, However it is highly recommended to use the water filter)
Put the Marijuana in the tube and burn it,
while you start to burn it, lift up the AiroPump slowly till the top.
Once the Airoboom is full with smoke, put your lips on the tube and press the
AiroPump down.The smoke will run through the tube straight to your body.
The effect is very strong, and the inhaling is very smooth.
It’s a new kind of high, that only Airoboom can provide, its just feels
better, cleaner.
The Airoboom is about a better experience of smoking and reducing the
damage while smoking.
Why should you support us?
First of all, If you like to smoke marijuana, You MUST HAVE Airoboom!!
If you are not used to smoke, and need to use Marijuana for medical
purposes, the Airoboom can help you consume THC with less toxins and effort.
There are many people who use medical marijuana in their daily life because
they have cancer or other diseases and the marijuana helps them to reduce the
pain and improve appetite.
Many of those people are non-smokers,
yet the marijuana helps them in their sickness.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What does <i>SPRITZ</i> sound like?</h2>
<p><b><i>SPRITZ</i></b>  plays your music as though it's being played at a <b>professional recording studio</b>. The technology that makes this possible is world acclaimed,<i><b> patented</b></i> and rarely available in a consumer product.  It's called the BONGIOVI DIGITAL POWER STATION (DPS), and the difference is astounding, with enhanced clarity and depth creating a virtual sound stage that will blow you away. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444401084/yue7fdbzddi8oqnqkrep.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What is AUDIO REMASTERING?</h2>Spritz incorporates BONGIOVI DPS which does <b>Real Time Audio REMASTERING</b> of music while it's streaming over Bluetooth. This patented algorithm understands that human ears pay the most attention to sounds to which they are most sensitive. <p>No matter what the original content of the audio is, Bongiovi DPS will optimize the signal so that important sounds stay at a consistent volume without losing their emotional impact or causing unwanted artifacts.</p>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><b>The audio waveform below is for the song  </b></i><i style=""font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>New York, New York” </b></i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i style=""font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>by Tony Bennett and Frank Sinatra:</b></i></p>
<p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445218205/pzc5qslfvqe5oeaoap5q.png"" src="""" style=""width: 864.8739495798319px; height: 166px;""/></i></p>
<p>Notice the lighter blue core of the waveform surrounded by darker blue peaks. The light blue represents the average power of the audio and includes much of the information we perceive as loudness. The darker blue peaks can be much greater than the average power at any given moment. A normal audio system must work very hard to reproduce all of this information exactly as delivered.</p>
<p>The Bongiovi Digital Power Station™ Real Time Audio ReMastering™ process reacts instantly to the audio signal.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i style=""font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>Here is ""New York, New York"" processed by Bongiovi DPS:</b></i></p>
<p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445218448/jljgpjccyfqd9grednv1.png"" src="""" style=""""/></i></p>Notice how the lighter blue is extremely consistent while the dark blue (still vibrant and active) is more controlled. It is easier for speakers to reproduce and it is easier for us to listen to. Even though this waveform appears quieter, you will perceive both examples to be the same volume. All of that space around the waveform is headroom that can be used to make the original recording much louder and clearer in a noisy environment. It's almost like the audio equivalent of HIGH DEFINITION TV, for your ears when listening to music.<p>This short video demonstrates the technology at work, enhancing a music file. Keep in mind that this video simulation uses the speakers in your computer or smartphone so it can't really do justice to the actual audio quality which Spritz can deliver, using the BONGIOVI DPS processing technology. </p>

<p>With years of experience creating some of the finest recordings in the world, Tony along with a highly talented team of engineers and sound designers created an incredible digital audio enhancement algorithm called BONGIOVI DPS which has the following capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Dynamic Range Control</b></li>
<li><b>Automatic Volume Control</b></li>
<li><b>Stereo Field Enhancement</b></li>
<li><b>Vocal Clarity Enhancement</b></li>
<li><b>Bass Enhancement</b></li>
<li><b>Sound Stage Enhancement</b></li>
<li><b>Ultra High Frequency (Air) Enhancement</b></li>
<li><b>Compressed audio (mp3, streaming, Bluetooth) restoration</b></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>It's <b><i>so</i></b> advanced, it actually even <i>protects</i> the speaker driver from damage during music playback, which lengthens it's lifespan significantly.</p>
<br/><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What's Inside?</h2>
<p>Spritz has been designed with an incredible degree of engineering, in order to achieve a robust and reliable product that's waterproof, user-friendly and also acoustically optimised. As a prerequisite, <i><b>SPRITZ</b></i>  had to be <i>MODULAR  </i>for anyone to take apart/re-assemble, so that the bottle could be washed or even sterilised.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447000964/lf8quwebilk8zfkizj36.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>But the construction had to be acoustically beneficial as well. We achieved all this and more, with what we call our <b>Acoustic Turbine Architecture</b>, which delivers a  360º field of sound dispersion, so that Spritz can face ANY direction, with no loss of sonic performance. Check out this video that explains the design:</p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FPaTSyO7rseM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DPaTSyO7rseM%26feature%3Dyoutu.be&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FPaTSyO7rseM%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p>
<div>In order to achieve an ultra wide frequency response, a traditional speaker box needs to incorporate 2 separate speaker drivers : the TWEETER and the WOOFER (for HIGH and LOW frequencies). But that takes a lot of space, and is impossible in a product the size and shape of <b><i>SPRITZ</i></b>. With this in mind, we engineered a solution that perfectly resolves the dilemma: the HYBRID SPEAKER. It's a combination of the 2 different types of speakers fused into one compact component. And it delivers! Crystal clear high frequency notes with sparkle and sharpness, with a bass response so powerful <i>you can actually FEEL it in your hands</i>. <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445219803/tvoh4nj9nhpon5hykccq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>But what good is all that sound quality if you can't enjoy it for any reasonable length of time - like a minimum of 8-10 hours on a single charge?  That normally means a HUGE, HEAVY battery inside... <i>something we did not want to burden our users with</i>. So, we set out to achieve our goal in 2 ways: <p><b><u>A. Power Efficient Circuit Design: </u></b></p>
<p>We designed the Spritz PCB with a totally digital architecture using micro-components to consume the absolute MINIMUM energy when operating.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445242169/jdd0przatpbzdxnarx3i.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p> <p><b><u>B. Advanced Lithium Battery Technology: </u></b></p>Not all Rechargeable batteries are the same. SPRITZ uses an advanced <i>Lithium Polymer </i>cell (the same type as you'll find in the iPhone) which has one of the highest energy densities of all rechargeable batteries today. And the Spritz Lithium cell comes with an integrated safety circuit that prevents over-charging, over-loading and even under-voltage. This is extremely important not only because it extends the life of the battery itself, but even more so because it prevents internal cell damage which can sometimes lead to overheating of the battery. We've made no compromises, designing every aspect to ensure the highest standard of user safety. <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445244428/hr1206ix9ojshuuc7gxp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2>What about the Safety of the Bottle?</h2>
<p></p>
<p>The <b><i>Spritz</i></b> bottle is designed using an amazing next generation copolyester material called  <b>TRITAN</b>™ made by the world famous technology giant <i>EASTMAN. </i><b>TRITAN</b>™ is an impact resistant shatterproof tough plastic that has been approved for use in food and liquid/water contact applications by numerous regulatory agencies around the world, including:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>U.S. FDA</b> (Food &amp; Drug Administration)</li>
<li>Health <b>Canada</b>
</li>
<li>
<b>European</b> Food Safety Authority and European Commission</li>
<li>
<b>China’s</b> Ministry of Health</li>
<li>
<b>Japan</b> Hygienic Olefin and Styrene Plastics Association</li>
</ul>
<div>In particular, <b> TRITAN™ is <i><u>BPA free.</u></i> </b>BPA stands for <i>Bisphenol A </i>which is an industrial chemical that is used to make certain plastics and resins since the 1960s. BPA is often used in containers that store food and beverages, such as water bottles.<p></p>
<p>Research has shown that BPA can seep into food or beverages from containers that are made with BPA. Exposure to BPA is a concern because of possible health effects of BPA on the brain, behavior and prostate gland of fetuses, infants and children. <b>TRITAN™</b> is a <b><i>BPA-free material</i></b> — it is not manufactured with Bisphenol A (BPA) or other bisphenols, such as BPS.  Additionally, <b>TRITAN™ </b>has <b>no <i>estrogenic or androgenic hormonal activity. </i></b></p>
<p><b>TRITAN™</b> also has exceptional dishwasher durability — so it encourages proper sanitation of the Spritz Water Bottle, for greater safety. </p>
<p><b><i>Spritz</i></b> will also comply with the European CE safety standard: <b><i>RoHS</i></b>  (Restriction of Hazardous Substances) which includes restrictions on the use of <b>Lead, Mercury, Chromium-VI and Cadmium</b>. A full series of chemical lab-testing to verify compliance will be conducted prior to mass production. </p>

</div></div>","Water for your Body, Music for your Soul.
We've merged 2 essential aspects of life seamlessly into an elegant solution that integrates STUDIO GRADE audio into a state of the art rugged, smart water-bottle that's wirelessly controlled from your smartphone.  
Full Silicone Rubber
Tangle-Proof Robust and Resilient Design
High Current Capacity for Super-Fast Charging
Extended Cable Length 
Leatherette Cable Wallet Included!

What is Spritz? Spritz  is about incredible acoustics. It's a wireless music player that's designed and built with extremely advanced audio technology, then calibrated and tuned by a professional recording studio. It delivers an unparalleled sonic range with almost 95dB of loudness. That's as loud as a jackhammer at 50 ft !  It can work wirelessly, streaming music from your smartphone, and comes with an app (iOS and Android versions) that fully controls SPRITZ.  Or you can also use it without your smartphone, as a stand alone MP3 player, using a standard microSD card to store and play up to 32GB of your music.  But Spritz is also about personal healthcare. It provides you with the ability to carry essential drinking water (or any hydration fluid) for your active lifestyle, and is smart enough to REMIND you to STAY hydrated. All this in a rugged and robust bottle that's waterproof rated at IPX4  and durable enough to handle practically any activity, including active sports.  How Will Spritz Benefit My Health?It's so easy to get caught up in our everyday lives, that something as important as keeping our bodies well hydrated often slips our minds, and can even be damaging to our bodies. To tackle this problem, we've developed a system that can remind you as frequently (or not)as you like, to take a sip of water! Using the app, Spritz automatically pauses the music that's playing, to remind you to hydrate yourself at your desired time interval, using a gentle notification of your choice.

What does SPRITZ sound like?
SPRITZ  plays your music as though it's being played at a professional recording studio. The technology that makes this possible is world acclaimed, patented and rarely available in a consumer product.  It's called the BONGIOVI DIGITAL POWER STATION (DPS), and the difference is astounding, with enhanced clarity and depth creating a virtual sound stage that will blow you away. 



What is AUDIO REMASTERING?Spritz incorporates BONGIOVI DPS which does Real Time Audio REMASTERING of music while it's streaming over Bluetooth. This patented algorithm understands that human ears pay the most attention to sounds to which they are most sensitive. No matter what the original content of the audio is, Bongiovi DPS will optimize the signal so that important sounds stay at a consistent volume without losing their emotional impact or causing unwanted artifacts.

The audio waveform below is for the song  New York, New York” 
by Tony Bennett and Frank Sinatra:

Notice the lighter blue core of the waveform surrounded by darker blue peaks. The light blue represents the average power of the audio and includes much of the information we perceive as loudness. The darker blue peaks can be much greater than the average power at any given moment. A normal audio system must work very hard to reproduce all of this information exactly as delivered.
The Bongiovi Digital Power Station™ Real Time Audio ReMastering™ process reacts instantly to the audio signal.  
Here is ""New York, New York"" processed by Bongiovi DPS:
Notice how the lighter blue is extremely consistent while the dark blue (still vibrant and active) is more controlled. It is easier for speakers to reproduce and it is easier for us to listen to. Even though this waveform appears quieter, you will perceive both examples to be the same volume. All of that space around the waveform is headroom that can be used to make the original recording much louder and clearer in a noisy environment. It's almost like the audio equivalent of HIGH DEFINITION TV, for your ears when listening to music.This short video demonstrates the technology at work, enhancing a music file. Keep in mind that this video simulation uses the speakers in your computer or smartphone so it can't really do justice to the actual audio quality which Spritz can deliver, using the BONGIOVI DPS processing technology. 

The magic that drives this incredible technology actually comes from a long legacy of a man, a studio and dozens of the most talented artists that ever lived.



The man is Tony Bongiovi, who in 1977 built the world’s most famous recording studio: the Power Station. 

Due to its breakthrough acoustical design and engineering, the Power Station Studios in NYC became the facility of choice for artists including Madonna, Mariah Carey, Paul McCartney, Eric Clapton, Whitney Houston, Billy Joel, AC/DC, Bryan Adams, Aerosmith, The Beach Boys, Bon Jovi,  Miles Davis, Bob Dylan, Grateful Dead,  B.B. King,  Willie Nelson, The Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen, Sting, Barbara Streisand, Neil Young, and many more.

With years of experience creating some of the finest recordings in the world, Tony along with a highly talented team of engineers and sound designers created an incredible digital audio enhancement algorithm called BONGIOVI DPS which has the following capabilities:

Dynamic Range Control
Automatic Volume Control
Stereo Field Enhancement
Vocal Clarity Enhancement
Bass Enhancement
Sound Stage Enhancement
Ultra High Frequency (Air) Enhancement
Compressed audio (mp3, streaming, Bluetooth) restoration


It's so advanced, it actually even protects the speaker driver from damage during music playback, which lengthens it's lifespan significantly.
What's Inside?
Spritz has been designed with an incredible degree of engineering, in order to achieve a robust and reliable product that's waterproof, user-friendly and also acoustically optimised. As a prerequisite, SPRITZ  had to be MODULAR  for anyone to take apart/re-assemble, so that the bottle could be washed or even sterilised.  


But the construction had to be acoustically beneficial as well. We achieved all this and more, with what we call our Acoustic Turbine Architecture, which delivers a  360º field of sound dispersion, so that Spritz can face ANY direction, with no loss of sonic performance. Check out this video that explains the design:

In order to achieve an ultra wide frequency response, a traditional speaker box needs to incorporate 2 separate speaker drivers : the TWEETER and the WOOFER (for HIGH and LOW frequencies). But that takes a lot of space, and is impossible in a product the size and shape of SPRITZ. With this in mind, we engineered a solution that perfectly resolves the dilemma: the HYBRID SPEAKER. It's a combination of the 2 different types of speakers fused into one compact component. And it delivers! Crystal clear high frequency notes with sparkle and sharpness, with a bass response so powerful you can actually FEEL it in your hands. But what good is all that sound quality if you can't enjoy it for any reasonable length of time - like a minimum of 8-10 hours on a single charge?  That normally means a HUGE, HEAVY battery inside... something we did not want to burden our users with. So, we set out to achieve our goal in 2 ways: A. Power Efficient Circuit Design: 
We designed the Spritz PCB with a totally digital architecture using micro-components to consume the absolute MINIMUM energy when operating.
 B. Advanced Lithium Battery Technology: Not all Rechargeable batteries are the same. SPRITZ uses an advanced Lithium Polymer cell (the same type as you'll find in the iPhone) which has one of the highest energy densities of all rechargeable batteries today. And the Spritz Lithium cell comes with an integrated safety circuit that prevents over-charging, over-loading and even under-voltage. This is extremely important not only because it extends the life of the battery itself, but even more so because it prevents internal cell damage which can sometimes lead to overheating of the battery. We've made no compromises, designing every aspect to ensure the highest standard of user safety. 
What about the Safety of the Bottle?

The Spritz bottle is designed using an amazing next generation copolyester material called  TRITAN™ made by the world famous technology giant EASTMAN. TRITAN™ is an impact resistant shatterproof tough plastic that has been approved for use in food and liquid/water contact applications by numerous regulatory agencies around the world, including:



U.S. FDA (Food & Drug Administration)
Health Canada


European Food Safety Authority and European Commission

China’s Ministry of Health

Japan Hygienic Olefin and Styrene Plastics Association

In particular,  TRITAN™ is BPA free. BPA stands for Bisphenol A which is an industrial chemical that is used to make certain plastics and resins since the 1960s. BPA is often used in containers that store food and beverages, such as water bottles.
Research has shown that BPA can seep into food or beverages from containers that are made with BPA. Exposure to BPA is a concern because of possible health effects of BPA on the brain, behavior and prostate gland of fetuses, infants and children. TRITAN™ is a BPA-free material — it is not manufactured with Bisphenol A (BPA) or other bisphenols, such as BPS.  Additionally, TRITAN™ has no estrogenic or androgenic hormonal activity. 
TRITAN™ also has exceptional dishwasher durability — so it encourages proper sanitation of the Spritz Water Bottle, for greater safety. 
Spritz will also comply with the European CE safety standard: RoHS  (Restriction of Hazardous Substances) which includes restrictions on the use of Lead, Mercury, Chromium-VI and Cadmium. A full series of chemical lab-testing to verify compliance will be conducted prior to mass production. 

What's included? 
Spritz will come in 2 kit versions: The WORKOUT, and the MARATHON.

The SPRITZ-WORKOUT kit includes:
1. The SpritzAudio Module, fully encased in Silicone Rubber protection                  with integrated Smart-Control keypad. This includes all the electronics, the hybrid speaker driver, the Micro-SD card reader, and the Lithium Cell + USB charging port.

<br/><p><b>ANTIDOTE 02 from Corpa Flora, the benefits of
retinoids without the irritation or the sensitivity to sunlight</b></p>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>Céline Champigny,
the founder of Corpa Flora, has worked over 20 years in Academic Research
Laboratories before establishing her company specializing in the development of
topical lipid complexes that nourishes the skin. These lipid complexes go
beyond conventional beauty products and combine both cosmetics and skin
nutrition. The major advantage of our lipid formulas is that they can penetrate
the epidermis (where most conventional beauty creams cannot go) and strengthen the
skin’s natural lipid barrier by providing the cells with essential fatty acids
that the body cannot produce (Omega 3 and 6). Omegas 3,5,6,7 and 9 are also
found in Corpa Flora’s lipid complexes.</p>

<p><b>Prizes and Distinctions</b></p>

<p>Corpa Flora won the
Grand Prize for Best Innovation from the Canadian Beauty Group in 2014 for its

<br/>
<p><b>The versatility of Corpa Flora’s ANTIDOTES</b></p>
<p>Towards
the end of 2014, Corpa Flora introduced its first ANTIDOTE 01 Firming “Botox
effect” in the Canadian market, a lipid complex containing omega 3,6,7 and 9 as
well as a trademark plant extract from Acmella Spylanthes (also known as
Gatuline In-Tense). This extract has Lifting and Firming activity that can
reduce facial expression lines up to 50%. The goal of our ANTIDOTE line is to
conquer the market of dermo-aesthetic clinics looking to offer their clients a
more natural alternative skin care line that is as effective and less toxic. It
can also be used in conjunction with other existing lines and treatments such
as Botox and Hyaluronic acid injections. Our lipid ANTIDOTE’s can be used
alone or can be blended 50/50 with other facial creams or water-based serums to
increase their nourishing effects.</p>

<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Retinoid side effects</b><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>The
retinoid family is composed of synthetic and natural derivatives of vitamin A.
Certain retinoids require a medical prescription (adapalene, tazarotene,
tretinoin) and are generally used in the treatment of acne. There is
substantial scientific evidence that demonstrates that retinoids are not only
beneficial in acne treatment but they are also effective as an anti-aging
treatment. Skin care products containing retinoids (retinol, retinaldehyde,  retinyl propionate, retinol palmitate)
are available without prescriptions but these are much less effective. If you
decide to try one of these retinoid skincare products, be aware that you may
have secondary effects such as redness, irritations and greater sensitivity to
sunlight and should not be used on sensitive skin types.</p>
<p><b>Corpa Flora’s Challenge</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Corpa
Flora is currently completing the formulation of 2 new ANTIDOTE complexes,
ANTIDOTE 02 “Retinol Effect” and ANTIDOTE 03 “anti-redness”.  ANTIDOTE 02 contains a natural trademark
molecule that has the same properties as retinoids but without the secondary
effects. It will work on all skin types, including sensitive skin and can also
be used during the day since it is not photosensitive. THE ADVANTAGES OF
RETINOIC ACID WITHOUT IRRITATION AND SUNLIGHT SENSITIVITY.</p>
<p>ANTIDOTE
03 contains several anti-inflammatory ingredients including a trademark oil
extract from the Caper floral bud, also known as Gatuline derma-sensitive. This
lipid complex will act on the inflammatory response in order to soothe reactive
and sensitive skins as well as light to moderate rosacea which is difficult to
control without the use of corticosteroids.</p>
<p>We are
looking to raise $20,000.00 for the purchase of trademark ingredients as well
as pay the costs associated with the design of labels, packaging and publicity
flyers for our ANTIDOTE 02 and ANTIDOTE 03.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Corpa Flora and the Competition</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>We
distinguish ourselves from the competition by providing our signature “New
Generation” lipid complexes that can be used alone or in combination with other
creams or water-based serums. We are formulating what clinics are currently
demanding and we use molecules of natural origin that have been clinically
tested and are non-irritating to the skin. We believe that our lipid complexes
will contribute to improving skin health without the use of potentially toxic
or chemical ingredients (We are part of Environment Defence against toxic
ingredients in cosmetics and also Cruelty FREE). We offer effective green
cosmetics that work in synergy with the epidermis (lipophilic nature) and
contain essential fatty acids (Omega 3,5,6,7 and 9) that
truly nourish the skin. Our formulas do not contain any water and are composed
of 100% bioactive ingredients. </p>

<p><strong>Hi everyone, my name is Norman</strong>,</p>
<p>I am a
disabled ex-serviceman and very determined to be able to sustain my family with
fresh, organic fruit and vegetables using my ducks as the main source of
nutrients.  After this I would like to expand further to supply small
markets and a percentage going to charities to feed those people who need a
little help with fresh healthy products .</p>
<p>My background consists of a 20 year career in
the Royal Navy seeing service in the Falklands in 1982, Gulf War in 1991 and
with the United Nations in Cambodia 1993 earning me the M.B.E.  </p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>After my
service I had a very hard time getting used to a civilian life, but eventually
retraining as a computer engineer and getting back on my feet and loving life.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This came to an abrupt end a
few years ago and I have now found myself looking for a different way
of life and one which is more home grown. </p>
<p> I spent a lot of time this year
volunteering at <a href=""http://bioaquafarm.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://bioaquafarm.co.uk/</a> in Somerset </p>

<p>where Rainbow Trout are used as a source of nutrients
to feed and grow fantastic food, I also learned far more than any course could
have done and more importantly how to build a sustainable system (a big thank you to Antonio for all the info, wonderful lunches and stories)</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>So what is DuckPonics?</strong></p>
<p>DuckPonics is a circulation of duck waste (duck poo) from the pond and pumped
into floating veg beds where the roots hang free in the water.  The roots take up the nutrients, which in
turn treats the water, the water then flows back to the duck pond.  This system uses 95% less than traditional
horticulture farming.</p>
<p>The ducks are fed organic feed pellets as well as having a free run of the
garden; which in turn clears the garden of most slugs and snails and to my
amazement has kept the lawn at a nice height thus stopping me from using my
petrol lawnmower.</p>
<p>The only messy part of this system is cleaning the duck house on a regular
basis, however the hay which is also full of duck poo makes for fantastic
compost.</p>

<p>We are currently in rented accommodation near
Bristol and with the kind permission of my landlord,  I have
successfully established a happy brood of 6 ducks, a small Duck Pond  (thanks for the back breaking work Dad :-), and a  4x4 meter poly tunnel.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The timber for the poly tunnel came from broken pallets
at a local company Richard Austin Alloys <a href=""http://www.raaltd.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>http://www.raaltd.com/</u></a> who
donated all the wood and thus keeping the costs to a minimum.  I
would like to add a special thank you to Camy (Manager) &amp; Jason
(Assistant Manager) who helped with the big bits that I couldn’t carry and
ensured I had enough to build the poly tunnel.</p>
<p>Also with the wood I was able to build the Duck House</p>

<p>That is the trial stage just about to end and
now the next stage is to get this system working on a larger scale, get a
small profit going and start donating to those who need a helping hand to have
access to fresh organic healthy fruit and veg.</p>
<p>This is where your help is most wanted. 
We need a property with approximately 1/4 acre of land to make this
possible.  We already have 60% of the funds but the last 40% is proving to
be difficult and it’s the last 40% which will get the piece of land big enough
to have a free range area for the ducks during the day, a decent pond to do
what comes naturally to ducks and finally the poly tunnels with different media
beds for the food to grow.<span>  As before,
the timber I can get for free and the rest of the materials I can source, beg,
steal and borrow and in general take time to build up this project.</span></p>
<p><span><br/></span></p>
<p>So, my Crowd Funding friends – what can I do
to entice you to help me get all my ducks in a row?</p>
<p>Obviously for each £1 donated you will receive
a personal message of thanks and I will make a regular post of our progress to
date.</p>
<p>£50 won’t get you 50 messages, but at least
the offer of a visit to have a look around and a free lunch made from the produce.  As an additional bonus, my wife is Chinese and has readily agreed to cook some authentic Chinese dishes for our guests - did I mention she is a fantastic cook.</p>
<p>A couple of hours of volunteer work will also be
rewarded with a free lunch and huge thank you for your helping hands because
you did the difficult bits that I am unable to do on my own.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Additional Prize – everyone who donates just £5 will be
entered into a draw and picked at random after the campaign has completed. The
winner will be invited to visit us for the day, have a Duck adopted in their
name (or a name of their choice) and a personalised Tee shirt made to mark the
occasion.</p>
<p>Please look at the other rewards and choose whatever makes you feel happy.  </p>
<p>Remember, you are under no obligation to donate to my cause, but I would kindly ask you to please post this on your  Facebook  page and Tweet about it,  Email to all of your friends, collegues and even your local barber who's email is in your contacts by useing the Indiegogo share tools!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Thank you and wish me luck!</p>
<p>Please note: it has come to my attention that when people want to donate, they see the paypal name of Weiling Huang and are put off.  Weiling is my wife and we are using her account as I don't have one.</p>

</div></div>","This holiday season, are you looking for an opportunity to
give a gift with special meaning?  Give the Gift of Good Health to someone
in recovery by supporting our free
Herbal Medicine Clinic!   Touch
the lives of others, and honor a loved one at the same time. 
The People’s Medicine Clinic is an herbal health clinic that supports the people in  recovery through wellness.   We work with people in recovery from substance abuse, trauma,
and in stressful situations and/or experiencing financial hardship as they step
into their new lives.  We offer comprehensive health consultations, and work with each individual to make recommendations for integrating herbs, foods, and simple practices into their daily routines.  We offer unlimited follow up and on-going care, communication, and support.  We are
raising money to support what has, up until now, been a completely volunteer
labor of love/out-of-pocket expense. 
The People’s Medicine Clinic started with an herb garden, in
the early spring of 2013.  A group
of local herbalists planted 4 community garden plots with medicinal herbs, with
the vision of “making plant medicine
more accessible to all people.”  We
wanted to be a vehicle through which all people could find a connection to
health and healing, specifically those disempowered by the conventional health
care system, or just sick, discouraged, and broke.  
Here’s how we are bridging
access to wellness:





We help people feel better.  Clients
feel supported by our practitioners who spend time, listen, offer
recommendations, and follow up. Feeling well has had rippling effects on
people’s lives; bringing inspiration and a renewed sense of possibility. 



Clients see our practitioners FREE OF
CHARGE.  All
appointments, including follow-ups and additional communications, are included
in the free care.  We then provide free (or in some cases, at
cost) herbs, supplements, food, recipes, and information.  



We do targeted outreach. We prioritize serving people who would not otherwise be able to
afford alternative health care.  We do extensive outreach and networking
with community service agencies. 



We work
collaboratively.  We are in partnership with the
Recover Project and the Recovery Learning Center, sister organizations in
Greenfield that provide resources for people in recovery from substance abuse
and mental illness. The clinic is housed at their space, and we maintain a
close connection to their membership and staff. 



We offer
free programs and herbs to the whole community.  We maintain a community
medicine garden where we host free workshops, and invite the community to help
and harvest.  As much as possible, the clinic uses herbs harvested from
the medicine garden.



We are
grassroots.  We are
thrilled that one of our first clients has now become our clinic manager, and
has a leadership role in the functioning of the clinic.  Other clients, in
gratitude, are beginning to offer what time and resources they have as well.



We
encourage community support.  Practitioners of other modalities of complementary
medicine (massage, cranio sacral therapy) are inspired by our work, and are
beginning to offer their services through the clinic as well.  We would
like to grow our community engagement in the clinic and the garden, and welcome
your gifts of time, money or talent. 



We
consider the whole picture. 
The People’s Medicine Clinic is indirectly involved in Franklin County’s Opiate
Task Force, which was started to address the heroin/opiate problem in the
county.



Your
contribution will help achieve our goals for 2015 by paying for:



The
community garden plot fee, seeds, and supplies.



Herbal
medicines.  (A two-month supply costs about $50/client.)



Outreach
materials and informational hand-outs for clients.



Workshop
supplies.



Education
and training for our volunteer clinic manager.

Discovery to  Production:</span></b></h2><p>Hi, I am Jessica Filkins - I’m a yoga teacher, health coach and entrepreneur. During my studies at the Institutive of Integrative Nutrition, I was shocked to learn that chronic inflammation contributes to 7 out of 10 <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/pdf/2009-power-of-prevention.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">deaths</a> in the United States. <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-mark-hyman/is-your-body-burning-up-w_b_269717.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chronic Inflammation</a> is the underlying cause of heat disease, obesity, diabetes, dementia, depression, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and even autism. I realized there is a dire need to reduce inflammation through diet and natural medicine. I learned that turmeric and ginger are two of the most powerful anti-inflammatory spices in the world. <br/><br/>Prior to studying at the Institute of Integrative Nutrition, I suffered from inflammation for four years and I was diagnosed with IBS. I tried numerous cures ranging from extreme diets and supplements to bizarre therapies, but none of them completely healed my stomach.<br/><br/>Two years ago, while traveling in Indonesia, I discovered Jamu - their medicinal elixir, that many Indonesians drink on daily basis. This bright yellow liquid tasted like a bitter version of a spicy chai latte. Drinking Jamu on a regular basis drastically reduced my inflammation and soothed my stomach. I learned how to make Jamu, which contains primarily <a href=""http://jamujuice.com/turmeric/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">turmeric</a><a href=""http://www.southcountyfoodcoop.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a> and <a href=""http://jamujuice.com/ginger/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ginger</a> as well as several other varying ingredients.<br/></p><p></p><p>         <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1129707/files/20150103173203-_DSC0510.jpg?1420335123"" src="""" style=""width: 158.655319148936px; height: 239px;""/>     <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1129710/files/20150103173630-IMG_2494.jpg?1420335390"" src="""" style=""width: 177.860335195531px; height: 237px;""/>     <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1129702/files/20150103172854-P1011226.jpg?1420334934"" src="""" style=""width: 178.685714285714px; height: 236px;""/>      </p><p></p><p>Once I returned to the United States feeling healthy and happy, I wanted to share my discovery of Jamu with everyone who could benefit from its anti-inflammatory properties. I made my own version of it and shared it with my father and grandmother, who claim it reduced their arthritic symptoms.</p><p>I shared samples of my Jamu Juice with my co-workers at the<a href=""http://www.southcountyfoodcoop.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> </a><a href=""http://www.southcountyfoodcoop.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> local food Co-Op</a> in Wakefield, Rhode Island. They loved the beverage and my boss asked if I would make it for them to sell. The Co-Op’s customers also loved Jamu Juice so much that I could hardly keep up with the demand. Everyone wanted the recipe but no one wanted to make it at home because it involved washing, peeling, grating, mixing and blending nearly two dozen ingredients. </p><p>The medicinal effects of the spices in Jamu Juice are more pronounced when the beverage is consumed on a regular basis. Therefore,  I needed to find a way for people to easily make this delicious anti-inflammatory beverage at home. After many weeks of experimentation, I finally developed an instant turmeric-ginger chai tea mix, which I call <i>Liquid Sunshine</i>! Each scoop of this powdered spice mix contains <a href=""http://jamujuice.com/turmeric/chai-tea-ingredients/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ten powerful, anti-inflammatory spices</a>.</p><p>I sold this instant tea powder at famers markets in Rhode Island throughout the summer and fall and received amazing amounts of positive feedback from my customers. It is now flying off the shelves at several local health food stores and cafes.  My goal is to scale up production so that more people can enjoy the positive health effects of this tea and reduced inflammation. </p><div>

<p>I am a yoga teacher, health coach and entrepreneur. I love learning, surfing, cooking, traveling and meeting new people. I grew up on Block Island, a tiny island of the coast of Rhode Island. I graduated from Colorado College where I studied philosophy, psychology, and anthropology. I became very ill my senior year of college. My journey to health ended up being a four year process of self-discovery and a wonderful introduction the field of alternative medicine and nutrition.  Despite my illness, I co-founded a <a href=""http://haitianimmigrantartprogram.blogspot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://haitianimmigrantartprogram.blogspot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">nonprofit art program</a> for Haitian immigrant children in the Bahamas. I spent my summers on Block Island driving a launch boat, saving up money for my dream trip to Indonesia. Little did I know that this solo surf and yoga adventure around the would lead to my discovery of Jamu- the key to my healing and the beginning of a new career.</p>

&amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>Starting this business has not been
easy, but I have learned a lot during the process. Despite the fact that, in its current form, I do
not need any special equipment to make and package the tea, at a small scale,
nor am I cooking or processing anything, the Department of Health still
requires that all food products be produced in a certified kitchen. The
Alternative Food Co-Op in Wakefield, RI has allowed me to use a tiny section
of their small kitchen during the evening hours to make my tea provided I

It seems to be a perfect fit for expanding Jamu Juice PBC. It will cost
about $700 to apply and use their kitchen and then $25 per hour after that. With a new space, I
will have to reapply for a license through the Department of Health which will cost another
$500. Soon it will be necessary to hire employees to increase productivity. </p>
<p>Now that I have incorporated as a Public Health Corporation, my goal is to have millions of people

<p>While the powdered tea is popular and perfect for the winter, my
customers at the Alternative Food Co-Op rave about the cold liquid version,

as there are no dairy-free iced chai teas on the market- especially none with
turmeric! If this campaign raises more than $10,000, I will be able to work
with a bottling facility to make this creamy, healthy, chai tea available to big
name distributors such as UNFI.</p>
<p>Budgeting my time and resources to bootstrap this business has been a great challenge- even spending the time to prepare this campaign was a calculated decision. But with the possibility of bridging the gap from order by order production to mass distribution, I have decided to ask for your help.

</div></div>","From
Discovery to  Production:Hi, I am Jessica Filkins - I’m a yoga teacher, health coach and entrepreneur. During my studies at the Institutive of Integrative Nutrition, I was shocked to learn that chronic inflammation contributes to 7 out of 10 deaths in the United States. Chronic Inflammation is the underlying cause of heat disease, obesity, diabetes, dementia, depression, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and even autism. I realized there is a dire need to reduce inflammation through diet and natural medicine. I learned that turmeric and ginger are two of the most powerful anti-inflammatory spices in the world. Prior to studying at the Institute of Integrative Nutrition, I suffered from inflammation for four years and I was diagnosed with IBS. I tried numerous cures ranging from extreme diets and supplements to bizarre therapies, but none of them completely healed my stomach.Two years ago, while traveling in Indonesia, I discovered Jamu - their medicinal elixir, that many Indonesians drink on daily basis. This bright yellow liquid tasted like a bitter version of a spicy chai latte. Drinking Jamu on a regular basis drastically reduced my inflammation and soothed my stomach. I learned how to make Jamu, which contains primarily turmeric and ginger as well as several other varying ingredients.                         Once I returned to the United States feeling healthy and happy, I wanted to share my discovery of Jamu with everyone who could benefit from its anti-inflammatory properties. I made my own version of it and shared it with my father and grandmother, who claim it reduced their arthritic symptoms.I shared samples of my Jamu Juice with my co-workers at the  local food Co-Op in Wakefield, Rhode Island. They loved the beverage and my boss asked if I would make it for them to sell. The Co-Op’s customers also loved Jamu Juice so much that I could hardly keep up with the demand. Everyone wanted the recipe but no one wanted to make it at home because it involved washing, peeling, grating, mixing and blending nearly two dozen ingredients. The medicinal effects of the spices in Jamu Juice are more pronounced when the beverage is consumed on a regular basis. Therefore,  I needed to find a way for people to easily make this delicious anti-inflammatory beverage at home. After many weeks of experimentation, I finally developed an instant turmeric-ginger chai tea mix, which I call Liquid Sunshine! Each scoop of this powdered spice mix contains ten powerful, anti-inflammatory spices.I sold this instant tea powder at famers markets in Rhode Island throughout the summer and fall and received amazing amounts of positive feedback from my customers. It is now flying off the shelves at several local health food stores and cafes.  My goal is to scale up production so that more people can enjoy the positive health effects of this tea and reduced inflammation. 

                     
For a more detailed explanation of my discovery of Jamu, my journey to health and the development of this company please visit www.JamuJuice.com.
                             
Here is what other some of my customers have to say about Jamu Juice:

About Jessica
I am a yoga teacher, health coach and entrepreneur. I love learning, surfing, cooking, traveling and meeting new people. I grew up on Block Island, a tiny island of the coast of Rhode Island. I graduated from Colorado College where I studied philosophy, psychology, and anthropology. I became very ill my senior year of college. My journey to health ended up being a four year process of self-discovery and a wonderful introduction the field of alternative medicine and nutrition.  Despite my illness, I co-founded a nonprofit art program for Haitian immigrant children in the Bahamas. I spent my summers on Block Island driving a launch boat, saving up money for my dream trip to Indonesia. Little did I know that this solo surf and yoga adventure around the would lead to my discovery of Jamu- the key to my healing and the beginning of a new career.

          
Risks
& Challenges
Starting this business has not been
easy, but I have learned a lot during the process. Despite the fact that, in its current form, I do
not need any special equipment to make and package the tea, at a small scale,
nor am I cooking or processing anything, the Department of Health still
requires that all food products be produced in a certified kitchen. The
Alternative Food Co-Op in Wakefield, RI has allowed me to use a tiny section
of their small kitchen during the evening hours to make my tea provided I
continue to make the liquid version of the chai tea for them on a bi-weekly
basis. Luckily, I already had my food safety certification, but I also needed to get a license for my fledgling business. The wholesale/retail food-processing permit from the Department of Health took 3+ months to process and cost $500.  
Now that I have more customers
buying online and more stores selling my tea, I need a bigger space to blend
and package the spices. I have to store all of my ingredients and equipment at the production facility, but the Alternative Food Co-Op barely has enough space for their own materials. 
Right now I am only able to produce in small batches. I need to devise a more efficient package method with more durable and professional labels. This campaign will provide the funding to bridge the gap from order by order production to having inventory. This will enable me to focus on other aspects of the business, including research and development of new products.

<p><b><i>A note from the founder, Mary Clare... </i></b></p>
<p>Too busy for yoga? Not anymore.</p>
<p>While
 running a yoga studio on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, I found my 
client's schedules were so jam-packed that they could practice yoga only
 once or twice a month. Some clients joked that I should stream live 
classes so they could easily take them at home, at work, or while 
traveling. As an extensive world traveler and certified yoga teacher, 
that was a lightbulb moment. I set an intention for 2015: launch The 
Flying Carpet app! </p>
<p>I've said goodbye 
to the Big Apple and moved permanently to Madrid where I will film yoga 
classes and stream them live as well as offer them on-demand via mobile 
app. The Flying Carpet mobile app will also feature downloadable classes
 like ""Yoga Reboot"" and ""Jet Lag Rx"" to help frequent travelers get 
their minds and bodies back on track. We'll take our ""flying carpet"" 
around the world to film classes in beautiful and inspiring locales -- 
we already have an Ibiza beach class and a Spanish garden class in the 
works. On deck is a traditional asana class from India, the ancient birthplace of India. Classes at The Flying Carpet never take place in your typical 
sterile yoga studio! <br/></p>

training from Yogi Amrit Desai and Master Duncan Wong.  She ran a yoga studio on

The Flying Carpet yoga app: The world is your yoga studio. Visit it anytime anywhere via mobile app.

    

A note from the founder, Mary Clare... 
Too busy for yoga? Not anymore.
While
 running a yoga studio on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, I found my 
client's schedules were so jam-packed that they could practice yoga only
 once or twice a month. Some clients joked that I should stream live 
classes so they could easily take them at home, at work, or while 
traveling. As an extensive world traveler and certified yoga teacher, 
that was a lightbulb moment. I set an intention for 2015: launch The 
Flying Carpet app! 
I've said goodbye 
to the Big Apple and moved permanently to Madrid where I will film yoga 
classes and stream them live as well as offer them on-demand via mobile 
app. The Flying Carpet mobile app will also feature downloadable classes
 like ""Yoga Reboot"" and ""Jet Lag Rx"" to help frequent travelers get 
their minds and bodies back on track. We'll take our ""flying carpet"" 
around the world to film classes in beautiful and inspiring locales -- 
we already have an Ibiza beach class and a Spanish garden class in the 
works. On deck is a traditional asana class from India, the ancient birthplace of India. Classes at The Flying Carpet never take place in your typical 
sterile yoga studio! 




Whether you're 
suffering from wanderlust or traveler's fatigue, The Flying Carpet 
mobile app is for you -- it's made for yogis and travelers of all kinds.
 I can't bring this global yoga sanctuary to life without your help. 
I've found unique spaces to film from in Madrid and around the world but
 I need your help raising funds to pay for the production of the videos 
and the creation of the mobile app. We recently changed our funding goals- we now are targeting $13,00. It's not reflected in our target amount because Indiegogo won't let us change our final amount. So please keep that $13,000 in mind and read on to learn more about our 
business plan and to see some ""rough draft"" classes. 
Namaste,
Mary Clare
A
Sanctuary for Global Travelers

30,000 Foot View: Why do we call our yoga studio The Flying Carpet? Because
it's the first yoga studio you can take with you – and yoga used to be practiced on small carpets
before the invention of the modern yoga mat. With The Flying Carpet mobile app,
you can take your favorite class live from anywhere around the world –
or whenever you want. 



The Flying Carpet helps travelers find
balance, cure jet lag and traveler’s fatigue, and take classes on the go. Here’s what you’ll find on The Flying Carpet
mobile app: 

· 
On-Demand
MP3s and Instructional Videos: Our yoga classes, deep breathing exercises, and mindfulness
techniques are available for immediate download and can be practiced anywhere
in the world.





·  Classes from featured locations around the world: Yoga 
travel is the new armchair travel! Our app will continue to feature new 
classes from exciting, exotic locations around the world. Examples: Enjoy a 
sunset vinyasa class on the beach in Ibiza, or a traditional asana class
 from a beautiful Indian garden in Jaipur. We'll feature a different 
location every month, and even include some fun travel tips for those 
locations.




· 
Jet Lag Cures for Global Travelers: We’ll offer in-person and downloadable classes that help
travelers ""phase shift"" before jet travel and ""phase
adjust"" upon arrival, as well as calming exercises that alleviate jet lag. Here's a ""rough draft"" of the Jet Lag Rx class you can try. If you like it, please donate so we can make more with better production technology than Mary Clare's ipad and Windows Moviemaker:· 
Exercises to Reduce Flight Anxiety: Our app recommends
specifically-designed breathing exercises and mindfulness techniques that
help traveler’s brains produce anxiety- alleviating chemicals. When you
relax on the plane, you’ll feel great upon arrival.


·  Immersion

under the guidance of an Indian Yoga Master, and receive
