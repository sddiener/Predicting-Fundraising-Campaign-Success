<p><u><strong>Perceptions Theatre </strong></u>started as an idea by its founder and Artistic Director, Myesha-Tiara<br/>McGarner in her undergraduate years in Louisiana, where she received her Bachelor's in Theatre and Directing from Northwestern State University. She noticed the lack of diversity in the theatrical arts and those underserved communities that aren't exposed to those arts as often as they should, be it monetary reasons or lack of diversity, and decided to do something about it. After being a touring and regional theatre  actress for three years she moved to Chicago. the theatre capital of the world, to learn the ropes. Myesha-Tiara worked as a actress her first year learning new skills, then her second year she balanced acting and directing in the Chicagoland area. During this time she met like minded artist that are <strong>all currently working in the arts</strong> and they worked together to form Perceptions Theatre! </p>
<p>We are looking to change the way people, perceive the world around them one<br/>show at a time by shining light on underserved communities with theatre that: eliminates<br/>prejudice and discrimination by showing cultures in their natural settings and educating on said<br/>cultures, lessening neighborhood tensions and that defends human and civil rights, to name a few, specifically on the<strong> southeast side of Chicago</strong>.</p>
<p>As a<strong> full service theatre company</strong> we plan to help people from the very beginning of their acting career from headshots, to resume help, classes, full productions and more. We chose the southeast side of Chicago because there is so much diversity in this area, we live within this community and see the need for more arts related fields for the residents. Being able to understand what a <strong>great impact </strong>it has for the community to learn and be entertained from a diverse company that reflects them is priceless. It gives you hope that you can do the exact same things and we want to help you accomplish that!</p>
<p><u><strong>We also have a very unique casting style: </strong></u>We are a company that believes in the Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein’s “Brandy’s” Cinderella version of casting, meaning that we are hyper vigilant when it comes to the ethnic makeup of our shows. Unless specifically stated from the playwright or if the content of the show itself leans directly toward a specific ethnic group then all parts are open race wise.</p>
<p><strong>Your contributions</strong> will help us get through our infancy stage, first year, and beyond by providing:</p>
<ul>
<li>the ability to produce two readings and one full stage production in our 2020 season</li>
<li>the ability to pay actors and technical staff</li>

<h3>INTRODUCING THE DIME CIRCUS!</h3>
<p>THE SLAUGHTER BROTHERS DIME CIRCUS is a dark clown play that jacknives into a fantasy horror of transformation, revenge, fate, and parasitical insects preying on the guilty.                  Buster Keaton meets Guillermo del Toro!</p>
<p>THE SLAUGHTER BROTHERS DIME CIRCUS. Words and music by Sean Sullivan, critically-acclaimed theatre performer/creator, who has been called ‘a virtual Nijinsky of performance art’ by the New York Times, and whose work has been called ‘hilariously funny, demented, even dangerous and always kinetic’ by the Toronto Sun</p>
<p>This is our second and final campaign. The first was to make our pre-production workshop a reality, and thanks to donors like you, we did it! This time, we are asking you to help push us over the top to achieve our ultimate goal: a full production in the Spring of 2020!</p>
<p>With your help, and <u>only</u> with your help, we can make this one-of-a-kind theatrical adventure         into a reality.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>Our goal is now $7000. We have received a significant grant amount from the Canada Council for the Arts that gets us close, but not quite there. This campaign aims to take us across the finish line.</li>
<li>What happens if we come up short in our campaign? Don't worry. With what we do earn, we'll still produce the show! The difference will not affect the quality of our work because we are 100% committed to this play, but our production elements, (set, lighting, costumes, etc), and company salaries will be noticeably cut back. Other Ways You Can Help</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>When a play makes you laugh AND cringe AND think about something important, it is pretty special. That's what THE SLAUGHTER BROTHERS DIME CIRCUS is going to be, if only we can raise the money to bring it to life.</p>
<p>In our previous company Baby Monster Productions, we were able to produce two highly successful productions under the heading of 'Avante-Vaudeville.' Both shows toured Central Europe as well as New York, (multiple times), Toronto, and Los Angeles. Both were critical and popular successes. Both won lots of awards. We know what works in our little corner of the theatrical world. And what we have now is something we know will be entertaining and thought-provoking... if we raise the money to produce it.</p>
</div><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><p>Anytime you bring a new creation into the world there are hurdles to overcome.

<h3>Who We Are &amp; What We're Doing</h3>
<p>Futile Gestures is a movement collective co-founded by Dot Armstrong, Kyra Smith, Lea Torelli, and Liana Kleinman. Through offbeat, playful, and unexpected performances, we explore the nuances of human connection through immersive and site-specific works. </p>
<p>We’re putting our thoughts, feelings, and physical experiments under one roof for our first self- produced evening-length show. We are exploring tenderness and defiance, with variations on the theme of care. The space we inhabit will be just as much a collaborator as the other artists we bring on board. We are excited to see what directions our research leads us and we hope you can join us for the ride! Your contribution tells us you believe in our big dreams. Your contribution is a tangible expression of care.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; How You Can Help</h3>
<p>We are in the process of creating an evening of movement-based work, premiering in May 2020. It is our biggest undertaking thus far and we’re ready to make the leap. But we need your help to stick the landing! To realize our wildest dreams AND pay all of our collaborators, we need you to join the team.  </p>
<p>The $5,000 will cover costs for creative efforts both large and small. Our biggest expenses will be space rental and collaborator compensation.  We are adamant about paying our contributing artists a rate that reflects all the hard work and love they are pouring into this production. The rest of the funds will go towards purchasing props, costumes, sets, and anything else that enlivens our work. We’re offering lots of fun incentives, based on different levels of donations, to fuel your generosity. No matter how much you give, you'll get the satisfaction of contributing to a female-run arts organization--what could be better than that?! So put that pocket change to good use. </p>
</div><div>

<h3>Thank You!</h3>
<p>From a social media shout-out to your entire life savings, every contribution helps. It makes us feel like a million bucks to know our community supports the work we’re making. Tell your best friend, your mom, your dog, your Lyft driver, your second cousin twice removed, your weird aunt in Kansas, your upstairs neighbor who practices tap dancing at 2am… we want all of you to come with us on this adventure!</p>

<h3><strong><i>The Impact Of This Production On Our Community</i></strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p><i>The arts give us a safe space to explore the deepest and darkest parts of the human experience.<i>  Every person who takes part in one of our productions has an opportunity to push their boundaries as an artist, learning lots of new things about their personal craft along the way.<i>  In this production, we get to explore the depths of how grief can change one's perception and sense of morality.<i>  We hope to entertain you while teaching the very dark lesson of what can happen when a good person is wronged, leading to irreversible trauma.<i>  Revenge crosses a very blurry line between what is moral and what is not, and what true justice means.  It will be interesting to see if audience members think Kilburn is justified in his actions.<i>  After all, how far would you go if someone took everything you held dear?<i>  In a modern world where chaos and violence are becoming more and more common and the law is hardly just, how far would you go to serve true justice for those you love?</i></i></i></i></i></i></i></p>

The arts give us a safe space to explore the deepest and darkest parts of the human experience.  Every person who takes part in one of our productions has an opportunity to push their boundaries as an artist, learning lots of new things about their personal craft along the way.  In this production, we get to explore the depths of how grief can change one's perception and sense of morality.  We hope to entertain you while teaching the very dark lesson of what can happen when a good person is wronged, leading to irreversible trauma.  Revenge crosses a very blurry line between what is moral and what is not, and what true justice means.  It will be interesting to see if audience members think Kilburn is justified in his actions.  After all, how far would you go if someone took everything you held dear?  In a modern world where chaos and violence are becoming more and more common and the law is hardly just, how far would you go to serve true justice for those you love?

<h3><strong>Few words on why directing The White plague and why your HELP will matter</strong></h3>
<p>After not being able to understood the madness called war, as well as spending money for weapons production, I Gorjan Arevski, as theater director for my graduation play decided to work The White plague, which, although written before the Second World War, is too accurate and absolutely critical of the modern world. As an individual, I realized that in real life, it is dangerous if I am struggling to transfer Capek's request (through Dr. Galen) - ABSOLUTE PEACE, but because in theater fighting can be done on beautiful way, because the art is more organized than life, and as such there is an opportunity to criticize the chaos we live in.</p>
<p><i><strong>If you are also passionate about peace, I hope you will help me by donation or by sharing this campaign with people that will be willing to support this theater process. </strong></i></p>
<p>The team of my Graduation play is consisted of more than 40 people who share the same values and are ready to work hard and devoted through the process of this first production of Karel Capek's THE WHITE PLAGUE being staged in Macedonia ( and we hope later on it will travel to many countries as well)</p>
<p><strong>Theater with an attitude </strong></p>
<p>Every day it's harder and harder to create  an engaged theater when what the market can sell are comedies that make people laugh. The world has never been in a more complex situation - so many fronts and so many wars, and the population that has the opportunity to make changes – measures it values through the number of likes and clicks.</p>
<p><br/>They say to the young world remains, but after all it does not seem that there is much left?!</p>
<p><br/>We want a world and a theater in which we can freely ask questions, but also actively work in creating better conditions. For all of us. Art has the power to make changes. But only if it is sincere and committed.</p>
<p>The whole team involved in this play does not base their engagement on material gain. In the funds planned for setting the performance, the costs are provided for the needs of scenery and costume design. Our  biggest desire is to stage it as many places as possible, and therefore the remaining money are planned for travel costs.</p>
<p><br/>Setting this text on Capek is not a coincidence. This team tried to get the support of cultural institutions in Macedonia, but for the play that promotes peace, education and humanity, all doors were closed.</p>
<p><br/>We get knocked down, to get back up.<br/>And this is the time to do it we need your help.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>Brief budget explanation </strong></p>
<p>- Actors and director work without honorarium <br/>- Costumes for 16 actors will cost 1300 euros<br/>- Scenography 1200 euros<br/>- Marketing 500 euros<br/>- Traveling fund 2000 euros <br/>Total 5000 euros</p>
<p>The scenography and costumes which will later on be donated to the Faculty of Dramatic Arts in Skopje where most of the students who are part of the team were/are studying. This equipment will be of a great use for the future theater plays they and their future colleagues will perform.</p>
<p><strong>About the Faculty of Dramatic Arts</strong></p>
<p><br/>The director Gorjan Arevski is a graduate student at the Faculty of Dramatic Arts in Skopje, in the class of professor Zlatko Slavenski and assistant Kushtrim Bekteski. Up to now, during his studies, he has worked on the following dramatic texts:„Pečalbari“ (A. Panov), „All my sons“ (A. Miller), „The Seagull“ (A.P. Chekhov) and the „Enemy of the state“ (H. Ibsen).</p>
<p><br/>Gorjan prefers socially engaged plays, which speak locally, and act globally.</p>
<p><br/>Most of the actors will be students at the Faculty of Dramatic Arts, as well as some already completed (employed and unemployed actors).</p>
<p><br/>The rest of the collaborators will also be young, mainly students who deal with their concerns of interest, such as music, production, architecture, costume design, film directing, etc.<br/> </p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>When Colleen Snell and Noelle Hamlyn were 3 and 5 years old, they created a performance in their backyard with cast of frogs performing tricks. From this whimsical debut springs the name ""Frog in Hand,"" and our belief that art can happen anywhere. Frog in Hand has evolved into a collective of professional artists who create and perform in unusual spaces. We incorporated as a not-for-profit in 2016. We provide paid opportunities for dance artists to nurture a sustainable, meaningful artistic practise. Our artistic genre is contemporary dance.</p>
<p>While we have been working as a collective for years, we have never self-produced a performance, or participated in the Toronto Fringe. We need your help to do both. Frog in Hand is creating an evening-length work for 16 dancers, called ""The Fall."" This work will explore the battle to stay upright, the influence of gravity, exhaustion and control. ""The Fall"" will use large high jump mats ten inches thick, onto which the dancers will land and fall. These will also be our set. ""The Fall"" will be presented in the site-specific category of the Toronto Fringe; it will be performed 8 times over the course of two weeks. </p>
<p>While there will be box office revenue from our performances, Fringe tickets are only $11, meaning our income will not cover all of the costs of this production. We are asking for your help to cover the cost of the production. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are raising funds to cover honoraria for our dancers. We are also looking to cover standard production costs such as rehearsal and performance space, publicity expenses, costumes and the Fringe entry fee. We are hoping to raise $4000 - any and all support will make a difference.</p>
<p><font>We have a number of unique perks to thank you for your contribution!</font></p>
<p>$500 An hour-long dance party for you and ten friends, led by Colleen Snell <br/>$200 Invitation to a pre-show chat in the performance space, two tickets to the show <br/>$150 A unique purse created by Noelle Hamlyn, made from a vintage book<br/>$100 An invitation to a closed rehearsal <br/>$50 A signed cast poster <br/>$25 A shout-out on social media and a personal thank you card<br/>$10 A shout-out on social media</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>We know this opportunity to present ""The Fall"" at the Fringe will develop our site-specific skills, challenge us to make new discoveries, build our creative ability, contribute to place-making, amplify our social location and empower our voices. We know ""The Fall"" work will reach a wide spectrum of folks at the Fringe, including those who have never experienced contemporary dance. ""The Fall"" will develop Frog in Hand, building our strong history of producing unique dance works that genuinely support the artists involved.</p>
<p>Yet there is more, as this production is also an opportunity to bring together 8 professional dancers with 8 emerging artists. The emerging artists are all students returning to school. This is a unique opportunity to encourage mentoring and generational exchange between highly skilled dancers at different phases of their careers, as they work side by side to collaborate, rehearse and create.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We understand producing a show involves certain risks and challenges. We have experience producing schedules, liasing with venues and managing budgets. We have secured insurance, and have a sustainable organizational infrastructure ready to mitigate any risks involved. We are prepared.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand a donation isn't within everyone's budget. Support our campaign by sharing among your peers - help get the word out and make some noise about this campaign. You can use the Indiegogo share tools. We'd be grateful for in kind donations if you feel you have goods or services you might offer. Every little piece helps us get that much closer to our goal of putting on a fantastic, unique show.</p>

<h3>Ghost Quartet</h3>
<p>Hello! We are the UC Irvine Ghost Quartet, consisting of Aaron Miller, Becca Rowland, Dani Honeyman, and Mark Metzger. Ghost Quartet is a musical/concert by Dave Malloy, and we had the incredible opportunity of undertaking his piece and making our own production of it at UC Irvine. Out of determination and passion, we applied for a research grant from the school and received enough funding to make our production possible. Collectively between the four of us, we rehearsed for 10 weeks, learning the score and directing the piece entirely on our own, and performed this musical in the Robert Cohen Theatre at UC Irvine from June 6-8, 2018.</p>
<p>Our production received tremendous praise from students and faculty alike, often resonating deeply within our audience members. From suggestions and encouragement from those who saw our production, we are reaching out to theater companies to continue performing, and immediately received attention and opportunity from Tenth Avenue Arts Center in San Diego, California. They have graciously offered us their space to perform Ghost Quartet from August 17-19, but without the university's research grant, we need funding to continue this production. Your contribution will allow us to share this unique and beautiful piece of theatre with more and more people, sharing an evening of music and storytelling unlike anything people have experienced before.</p>
<h3><strong>The Show</strong></h3>
<p>Ghost Quartet is a musical/concert that is written and composed by Dave Malloy, and is a song cycle about love, death, and whiskey. The piece lives in a grey area between drama, concert, and concept album, very much being an undefined genre. The story follows the intertwining narratives of Grimm’s “Rose Red and Snow White,” Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Fall of the House of Usher,” Arabian Nights, and an original narrative of a murder on a modern-day NYC Subway platform. The piece also draws influence from The Twilight Zone, Into the Woods, Thelonious Monk, Rosemary Timperley’s “Harry,” Matsuzake, Stephen King’s Dark Tower series, 8-bit video games like Zelda and Castlevania, and a multitude of other sources.</p>
<p>The piece is performed by four actor/musicians. It is performed as an album; each track is announced and presented with minimal staging, and there are small breaks between each side. Side 3 is performed entirely in the dark. It is intended to be performed in a space recreating a living room-feel with rugs scattered across the playing space, lamps practically lighting the space, and cushions available for people to sit on the floor. We perform it in a 3/4 round with audience members directly next to us, creating an intimate experience. The show is highly collaborative between the performers and the audience, often giving instruments to audience members to play along with us, or maybe even drink some whiskey with us.</p>
<h3>Testimonials</h3>
<p>A few testimonials from students and faculty at UC Irvine:</p>
<p>“Ghost Quartet is a striking and poignant piece, held together by inspiring and delightful music. The cast of Ghost Quartet is striking and breath-taking. They make the show come to life in the truest sense of the word.”</p>
<p>“This group has taken a truly beautiful play and created an extraordinary experience for their audiences. Their voices transported me to many different worlds and completely immersed me in the many lives of these souls. Not only was this a night of incredible entertainment, but also magic, wonder, and thought-provoking questions.”</p>
<p>“This group has taken a truly beautiful play and created an extraordinary experience for their audiences. Their voices transported me to many different worlds and completely immersed me in the many lives of these souls. Not only was this a night of incredible entertainment, but also magic, wonder, and thought-provoking questions.”</p>
<p>“Ghost Quartet describes itself as a circular story and it certainly translates into a circular experience. It is aware of itself, inviting you present, echoes a recognized sense of play, and coaxes you into the unfamiliar. Unfamiliar is the structure of the play but, not the energy. The players work wonderfully to include you in a remembered feeling of eager story as a child. It can only be described as wonderful in the most literal sense of the word. It is a rounded comfort, like a nice sip of whiskey, or the silence around a campfire.”</p>
<p>""I was lucky enough to see the original off-Broadway production (as well as the reworked Edinburgh version) of Ghost Quartet, and I can say without a doubt that the UCI production revealed things to me that even the original cast did not. The specificity and care taken by the team at UCI was extraordinary and a treat beyond measure. Not only did the cast transport me into the vast array of worlds which encompass Ghost Quartet, they made me feel as if I was a part of their journey. I was influencing them. This openness was refreshing and made the incredible work that Ghost Quartet is shine so very brightly."" </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking to raise $1,500 for this production of Ghost Quartet. Funding is broken down as such:</p>
<p>$400 - Rights: Dave Malloy and his representatives have graciously offered us the rights to perform Ghost Quartet at $100/performance. We are having an eight-performance run at Tenth Avenue Arts Center, so we need to raise this in order to perform the piece.</p>
<p>$400 - Lighting/Sound Equipment: We light our shows using practical household lamps, and now that we are independent of the university we need to invest in dimmers in order to raise and lower our lights throughout the show.</p>
<p>$300 - Programs/Advertisement: We need funding to print our programs out for all of our audience members, and funding to advertise our show via internet and posters.</p>
<p>$150 - Whiskey: Ghost Quartet is a very communal show between the actors and the audience, and at one point in the show we pass out and serve whiskey to all audience members (21+) that would like a drink. We need money to buy a bottle of Evan Williams for the audience every night.</p>
<p>$250 - Miscellaneous Necessities: There are always new issues that arise, such as last minute instrument repairs and replacements. This funding can also go towards cost of travel.</p>
<p>We're offering some very cool perks to you in return for contributing to our campaign! Please check them out in the perks section of our page.</p>
<p>We hope to have your support, and we hope you can see our show!</p>

<p>Emily Cargill &amp; Dancers wants to broaden Charlotte dance on a regional &amp; national scale and a large and very important part of each of our seasons is touring to other cities and immersing ourselves into the dance communities while there.  From NYC to Detroit to Tampa to Durham, we have loved meeting the artists, dance makers and dance enthusiasts from across the globe that have made these cities their home.  Founder and Artistic Director, Emily Cargill, traveled to Boston as a teenager in the early 2000s to watch her sister perform with the Boston Ballet and vowed to always return. </p>
<p>""Boston has been, without a doubt, a destination city for the company since our inception in 2014.  The vibe of Boston is so versatile, from the historical monuments to the retro theatres.  Boston has always been somewhere I knew I had to perform when I started my own dance company.  And now I feel as though this opportunity, being selected to perform at the prestigious and historical Huntington Avenue Theatre, is EXACTLY what my teenage self had in mind only a *handful* of years ago. We are thrilled and honored to be representing the Southeastern region of the U.S. at the Boston Contemporary Dance Festival this August and are looking forward to presenting our work alongside other leading dance makers of today.""  </p>
<p>As a small, non-profit dance company, the ability of Emily Cargill &amp; Dancers to successfully tour and have an impact on dance communities nation-wide lies with you!  Individual contributions such as yours will go directly towards our Boston debut.  The donations received will offset travel costs, including the artists' airfare, dancer &amp; choreographer stipends, and lodging for the duration of the 2-day festival.  Help us kick off our 2019-2020 season by donating to our campaign and be a part of the success of our Boston premiere!  Any amount helps and we appreciate your donation to Emily Cargill &amp; Dancers.  Check out our perks and donate the amount that speaks to you!</p>

</div></div>","Emily Cargill & Dancers wants to broaden Charlotte dance on a regional & national scale and a large and very important part of each of our seasons is touring to other cities and immersing ourselves into the dance communities while there.  From NYC to Detroit to Tampa to Durham, we have loved meeting the artists, dance makers and dance enthusiasts from across the globe that have made these cities their home.  Founder and Artistic Director, Emily Cargill, traveled to Boston as a teenager in the early 2000s to watch her sister perform with the Boston Ballet and vowed to always return. 
""Boston has been, without a doubt, a destination city for the company since our inception in 2014.  The vibe of Boston is so versatile, from the historical monuments to the retro theatres.  Boston has always been somewhere I knew I had to perform when I started my own dance company.  And now I feel as though this opportunity, being selected to perform at the prestigious and historical Huntington Avenue Theatre, is EXACTLY what my teenage self had in mind only a *handful* of years ago. We are thrilled and honored to be representing the Southeastern region of the U.S. at the Boston Contemporary Dance Festival this August and are looking forward to presenting our work alongside other leading dance makers of today.""  
As a small, non-profit dance company, the ability of Emily Cargill & Dancers to successfully tour and have an impact on dance communities nation-wide lies with you!  Individual contributions such as yours will go directly towards our Boston debut.  The donations received will offset travel costs, including the artists' airfare, dancer & choreographer stipends, and lodging for the duration of the 2-day festival.  Help us kick off our 2019-2020 season by donating to our campaign and be a part of the success of our Boston premiere!  Any amount helps and we appreciate your donation to Emily Cargill & Dancers.  Check out our perks and donate the amount that speaks to you!
If you aren't able to donate financially, we still need you and love you!  Please help spread the word about our campaign on social media and share share share to your heart's content!

We would like to get money in order to pay all people who are willing to help and invest their work in the project, have the extra money in order to take care of the performer's safety and have a possibility to bring this project further - performative and research-wise.  <strong>By supporting 'st</strong><strong>.One</strong><strong> 33' you will help us to deal with the most common practical stuff as:</strong></p>

EN Since 'st.One 33' is a performance which doesn’t really fit in regular frames as dance, theatre, music performance, it is quite hard to get financial support for it. This is why we need your help! This performance requires a lot of strength and commitment from the performer and from the team. We would like to get money in order to pay all people who are willing to help and invest their work in the project, have the extra money in order to take care of the performer's safety and have a possibility to bring this project further - performative and research-wise.  By supporting 'st.One 33' you will help us to deal with the most common practical stuff as:
- transportation of the stones;
- the building, preparing the performance space;
- the rent of technical equipment;
- medical care during the performance;
- publicity;
- payment for people working for the project
and etc,

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Our goal is to do our part to revitalize the empty storefronts on State Street by renting one out the week of October 12th. Our goal for that week is to feature local artists, musicians, dancers, and non-profits. If the role of the artist is to make the revolution irresistible, we believe that artists should be at the revolution’s forefront - and the revitalization of State Street is a deeply needed movement towards change in our city.</p>
<p>Our work, as SELAH, has never been just about us. We believe in making dance accessible and relatable to all people, especially in a city that has supported us for the past five years. Santa Barbara has become an amazing hub for dance on the West Coast and we are honored to be a part of it, alongside artists and organizations with so many different interests, influences, and histories. Our goal with this event is to create an experience in which all artists can take part and everyone in Santa Barbara is welcome. We are partnering with many local artists and organizations alike to bring this vision to life.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We cannot do this alone and are looking for local support to make this event a success. Here's what we are asking for and what you get if you choose to support our fundraiser!</p>
<ul>
<li>Breakdown of our fundraising ask:<ul>
<li>$3000 for renting out an entire space on State Street. We already have some possible donations of lighting, sound, and vintage furniture to help us furnish the space. Now we just need somewhere to put them!</li>
<li>$1200 in artist's fees to cover the cost of working with our collaborators</li>
<li>$1500 to cover working with the best event manager in the city of Santa Barbara, Eji Experiences</li>
<li>$300 to cover expenses related to insurances and other event necessities</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At the various levels of donation, you will be able to claim complimentary general admission tickets to our show in the space OR our special VIP dinner event, catered by a local restaurant with a menu specially devised to pair with our VIP-only dinner and dance performance.</li>
<li>Whatever we fundraise will be used for this event. We are passionate about providing a platform for others to share their art and we hope to make this the best event of the year.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In the past, we have supported artists from Los Angeles, San Francisco, Orange County, Austin, and New York City by providing a space for them to share their work and to create networks of like-minded artists with big visions and dreams. </p>
<p>»The role of the artist is to make the revolution irresistible.«<br/>- Toni Cade Bambara 2011</p>
<p>Downtown Santa Barbara is currently full of empty storefronts and we hope to bring a little more life, even if just for a short time, back to downtown. If the role of the artist is to make the revolution irresistible, we believe that artists should be at the revolution’s forefront - and the revitalization of State Street is a deeply needed movement towards change in our city.</p>
<p>Our work, as SELAH, has never been just about us. Our work straddles the contemporary/modern aesthetic and while we have many influences, we want to highlight other amazing artists who do not share the same aesthetics as we do. Providing a literal space for others to share what they have created or what means most to them is the most powerful thing we can do with the platform that we have. We have invited dozens of local artists and organizations to participate in our evening and have been overwhelmed with the support and excitement about our event. And we hope that you are excited too!</p>

<li>Come to our shows during the week of October 12-19. We will have a ton of family-friendly events, installations, free classes, and multiple performances that we aim to make accessible and relatable to all people.</li>
<li>Want to donate but don't want to give cash? We are looking for local sponsors to assist with food, wine, beer, and other event necessities. Want to donate something for our fundraiser in September, even better!</li>
<li>Volunteer with us! There are many opportunities to work with us on this event. It will require a lot of hands and a lot of helpers. If you'd like to get involved with helping us produce this show, please email us at info@selahdancecollective.com and we will connect you.</li>

<h3>Hello!</h3>
<p>We’re Riaan Smit and Deborah Vieyra. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to invite you into our project!</p>
<p>In 2018, we came together to form A Room Somewhere as a vehicle to produce esteemed South African playwright Athol Fugard’s “Hello and Goodbye” for a Vancouver audience.</p>
<p>We are, as so many of you might be, multi-homed. As South African-Canadians and professional theatre artists, we see the artistic space as a means of fostering cross-cultural dialogue between the countries that define home for us. What better way to bind our geographies than through the spice route of words that Fugard has given us?</p>
<p>We have assembled a team of passionate and talented individuals to help us on our quest. Introducing...!</p>
<ul>
<li>Acclaimed South African theatre practitioner, <strong>Bo Petersen</strong>, will serve as the director of the production.</li>
<li>Classically trained violist, <strong>Thomas Beckman</strong>, will be composing original music for us.</li>
<li>The bubbly and bright <strong>Olivia Etey</strong> will be keeping us afloat as Stage Manager</li>
<li>
<strong>Keagan Elrick</strong> brings their discerning and keen eye to our show as lighting designer</li>
<li>Finally, <strong>Kimira Bhikum</strong> will be putting her deft creative hands to bear as Stage and Props Designer</li>
</ul>
<p>While we have an abundance of creative currency, we seem to be a little lacking in the dollar department. Theatre is expensive and the onus of taking on the risk of production often falls on the artists themselves. For this reason, we need your help bringing this important work to life.</p>
<p>So yes, we’re hoping you too can be part of our team in some way so that we can make this production the best it can possibly be! We’ve put together a menagerie of enticing perks to lure you in, each with its own relevancy to the play. (Careful, they are indeed very seductive. Binge-perking may occur.)</p>
<h2>The Play</h2>
<p>At this point, you may want to know a little more about this rubik’s cube of a play, so here goes:</p>
<p>Set in the home of a poor white family in 1960s Apartheid South Africa, “Hello and Goodbye” conjures the repercussions of evaporating identity. When all that you have been taught defines you is an authoritative regime and a guilt-driven religious tradition, where do you find your own narrative, your own story? </p>
<p>In a literary dance that steps between Beckett-like absurdity and the realism of Sam Shepard or Tennessee Williams, Fugard does a deep dive into a family torn apart by a toxic mix of self-loathing, lethal patriarchy, and the violence of the country in which it is set. The domestic collides with the political, as the two characters reconnect (and disconnect) in their childhood home, rummaging through the remnants of their lives in search of redemption, a father figure, legitimacy and cold, hard cash.</p>
<p>Into it? We thought you might be. So here’s what we need:</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<h3>Here’s what we’ve already covered:</h3>
<ol>
<li>We have the rights to the play! Marvelous.</li>
<li>We’ve paid the deposit for the space (The NEST, formerly Studio 1398 on Granville Island). Awesome.</li>
<li>We’ve partnered with Vancouver-based South African organizations to get in touch with the local community and see how we can form mutually beneficial partnerships. (One of these is the all-too-wonderful Education Without Borders. Check them out.)</li>
<li>We’ve done the nitty gritty like get insurance, a publicity machine up and running, and started scouting props, scenery and costumes.</li>
<li>We have a plan to get a bar up and running every night so that nobody goes thirsty.</li>
<li>We’re absolutely 100% immersed in the material. Rehearsals are already underway.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Here’s what we still need:</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Theatre rental fee for two weeks at The NEST, including staffing costs. </p></li>
<li>Travel for Bo Petersen, our director, from South Bend, Indiana, where she lives to Vancouver, Canada, where we do.</li>
<li>We are asking for $5500 to cover our venue costs and travel for our director. Below you can see a detailed breakdown of how we will used the funding we receive from you:</li>
</ol>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553393066/a0jcsxqh7m7ukpg2cyjk.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Here’s what you’ll get:</h3>
<p>Of course, the main benefit you will get is knowing that you have been an instrumental part of ensuring that independent theatre is live and well. You will have helped us bring this great work to a Vancouver audience.</p>
<p>But it doesn’t end there:</p>
<p>Remember those perks we mentioned? Take a seat, because we’re about to give you the highlights package:</p>
<p>At the top end of our perk spectrum, we are offering an exclusive performance of “Hello and Goodbye” in the comfort of your own home. What? Yes, amazing, we know! </p>
<p>Then, one tier down from that, we will invite you to enjoy your own home-cooked South African meal with the cast and crew of the play. Delicious in every way.</p>
<p>Our other perks range from a romantic date night, with two tickets and drinks at the play, to personalized shout outs to your very own poster when you come to see the play.</p>
<p>Each of our perks have been named from lines directly from the play. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The worth of theatre to catalyze productive dialogue and form cross-cultural ties is unparalleled. Never has this been more needed than in a world where elements of exclusionary nationalism and cultural isolation surface violently in our news streams. The immediacy of live performance brings audiences into direct contact with the Other, confronting difference in a manner that promotes reflection rather than violence.</p>
<p>Theatre has long been an instrumental part of South Africa’s complex history and its young democracy, and was an active force in the dismantling of Apartheid’s oppressive structures. Athol Fugard’s work brought together racially diverse performers in theatre spaces, in a time and place when this simple act was illegal. To understand this legacy is to appreciate the full weight of<br/>what artistic practice is able to achieve as a means of bringing about societal change.</p>
<p>Our aim is to bring this spirit of political dynamism to the theatre we produce, and create theatre that encourages productive discomfort.</p>
<p>We hope to pollinate the local Vancouver landcape with a theatrical and literary tradition that will help to diversify it. In doing so, we hope to open channels of dialogues, foster interest and help contribute to a Canada that has room for all the cultural backgrounds that make it up.</p>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
</div><div>
<p>If you’re unable to help financially, there are other ways you can contribute. Please help us by sharing our campaign far and wide so that we can make our production a reality.</p>
<p>And, of course, come and see the show! </p>
<p>We look forward to seeing you on Granville Island soon!</p>

We’ve put together a menagerie of enticing perks to lure you in, each with its own relevancy to the play. (Careful, they are indeed very seductive. Binge-perking may occur.)
The Play
At this point, you may want to know a little more about this rubik’s cube of a play, so here goes:
Set in the home of a poor white family in 1960s Apartheid South Africa, “Hello and Goodbye” conjures the repercussions of evaporating identity. When all that you have been taught defines you is an authoritative regime and a guilt-driven religious tradition, where do you find your own narrative, your own story? 
In a literary dance that steps between Beckett-like absurdity and the realism of Sam Shepard or Tennessee Williams, Fugard does a deep dive into a family torn apart by a toxic mix of self-loathing, lethal patriarchy, and the violence of the country in which it is set. The domestic collides with the political, as the two characters reconnect (and disconnect) in their childhood home, rummaging through the remnants of their lives in search of redemption, a father figure, legitimacy and cold, hard cash.
Into it? We thought you might be. So here’s what we need:

What We Need & What You Get
Here’s what we’ve already covered:

We have the rights to the play! Marvelous.
We’ve paid the deposit for the space (The NEST, formerly Studio 1398 on Granville Island). Awesome.
We’ve partnered with Vancouver-based South African organizations to get in touch with the local community and see how we can form mutually beneficial partnerships. (One of these is the all-too-wonderful Education Without Borders. Check them out.)
We’ve done the nitty gritty like get insurance, a publicity machine up and running, and started scouting props, scenery and costumes.
We have a plan to get a bar up and running every night so that nobody goes thirsty.
We’re absolutely 100% immersed in the material. Rehearsals are already underway.

Here’s what we still need:

Theatre rental fee for two weeks at The NEST, including staffing costs. 
Travel for Bo Petersen, our director, from South Bend, Indiana, where she lives to Vancouver, Canada, where we do.
We are asking for $5500 to cover our venue costs and travel for our director. Below you can see a detailed breakdown of how we will used the funding we receive from you:


Here’s what you’ll get:
Of course, the main benefit you will get is knowing that you have been an instrumental part of ensuring that independent theatre is live and well. You will have helped us bring this great work to a Vancouver audience.
But it doesn’t end there:
Remember those perks we mentioned? Take a seat, because we’re about to give you the highlights package:
At the top end of our perk spectrum, we are offering an exclusive performance of “Hello and Goodbye” in the comfort of your own home. What? Yes, amazing, we know! 
Then, one tier down from that, we will invite you to enjoy your own home-cooked South African meal with the cast and crew of the play. Delicious in every way.
Our other perks range from a romantic date night, with two tickets and drinks at the play, to personalized shout outs to your very own poster when you come to see the play.
Each of our perks have been named from lines directly from the play. 

The Impact
The worth of theatre to catalyze productive dialogue and form cross-cultural ties is unparalleled. Never has this been more needed than in a world where elements of exclusionary nationalism and cultural isolation surface violently in our news streams. The immediacy of live performance brings audiences into direct contact with the Other, confronting difference in a manner that promotes reflection rather than violence.
Theatre has long been an instrumental part of South Africa’s complex history and its young democracy, and was an active force in the dismantling of Apartheid’s oppressive structures. Athol Fugard’s work brought together racially diverse performers in theatre spaces, in a time and place when this simple act was illegal. To understand this legacy is to appreciate the full weight ofwhat artistic practice is able to achieve as a means of bringing about societal change.
Our aim is to bring this spirit of political dynamism to the theatre we produce, and create theatre that encourages productive discomfort.
We hope to pollinate the local Vancouver landcape with a theatrical and literary tradition that will help to diversify it. In doing so, we hope to open channels of dialogues, foster interest and help contribute to a Canada that has room for all the cultural backgrounds that make it up.
Other Ways You Can Help

If you’re unable to help financially, there are other ways you can contribute. Please help us by sharing our campaign far and wide so that we can make our production a reality.
And, of course, come and see the show! 
We look forward to seeing you on Granville Island soon!",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Helium is a story about regret, despair, and reconciliation. It is inspired by the story of Sharlotte Hydorn, a kindly old woman who began to sell suicide kits after the prolonged death of her husband. It aims to explore the fallout of tragedy, and how we can come together in spite of it.</p>

<h2>DUE TO THE CO-VID 19 PANDEMIC, ODD MAN OUT HAS BEEN POSTPONED TILL SPRING 2021. <br/>But rest assured, we can't wait to get it going!</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Three international theater companies have come together to create a new, one-of-a-kind performance, experienced entirely in the dark. This new style, supported by a groundbreaking methodology that promotes inclusivity, innovation, and diversity, promises to completely change the face of American theater. </p>
<h2><strong>And we need your help to make it happen. </strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1575512964/en5jingywlultvz99woo.jpg"" src=""""/> </p>
<p>In a pitch-black room, a dying, blind Argentinian tango musician recalls the story of his life. What follows is a whirlwind of evocative, sensorial memories: his first braille lesson, his first day of school, his first love, his first heartbreak, and his journey across continents.  What does music sound like in the dark? How do you describe a color when you can’t see it? What does the color of our skin and the sound of our voices feel like? What do you see instead, when you can’t see? Experienced entirely in the dark, <strong>Odd Man Out</strong>’s world and characters are brought to life by six actors through a dynamic and immersive sound design, delicate choreography, and an innovative use of smell and touch. The production builds upon the groundbreaking performance style developed by Argentinian company, Teatro Ciego, and takes it to new and thrilling heights. The result is a completely immersive experience that awakens all the senses, unleashes the imagination, and stimulates each and every part of the body.</p>

<p>The piece is an <strong>international collaboration</strong> between two North American theatre companies, <strong>Theatre C </strong>and <strong>Cuchame Theatre Co</strong>, with recognized Argentinian theatre company, <strong>Teatro Ciego</strong>, who over its 15 year history has focused on creating pitch-black experiences developed and performed by blind and low-vision artists. In line with that mission, the US premiere of the piece in Fall 2020 will also include an American cast of majority blind and low-vision artists, bringing awareness to the creative impact of an often-ignored artistic community. The partnership is the largest international collaboration these companies has ever undertaken, and was kicked off by the Spanish premiere of the piece in November 2019, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, to rave reviews. Planned for the fall of 2020, the US premiere will be preceded by an extended residency at the Teatro Ciego space in Argentina, where an American cast will train in the Teatro Ciego method. The project is more than a theater piece: <strong>it is an international exchange that seeks to create lasting relationships, catalyze creative collaborations across continents, and bring innovative new methods to the American theater landscape. </strong></p>

<p>Odd Man Out is a <strong>revolutionary</strong> project on many fronts. Artistically, there are few companies with the amount of experience and success as Teatro Ciego has in developing and creating experiences in the dark. For the past 15 years, the company has been at the forefront of creating and developing pitch-black productions across the world for all ages and situations, and has partnered with companies like Google, Nike, and Disney to create unique, never-before-seen aural and spatial experiences. In the US, some companies have experimented with experiences in the dark, but none to the scale, design, and full sensorial level of <strong>Odd Man Out</strong>. Supporting this piece would mean supporting a never-before-seen creative methodology and practice, and help usher in a new phase in the American theatre experience.</p>
<p>Yet perhaps more excitingly, <b>Odd Man Out</b> is groundbreaking in creating new opportunities for an often-ignored within the arts: blind and low-vision individuals. Creating work in the dark provides an equal playing field for actors with varying levels of visual ability, and promotes new and exciting ways of creating meaning and emotion. In line with the mission of Teatro Ciego in Argentina, the performing ensemble of Odd Man Out in the US will be <u><strong>a majority of blind and low-vision artists</strong></u>. To support the reach and impact of the piece, <strong>Odd Man Out</strong> is collaborating with Alie B. Gorrie, an artist and activist that seeks to educate and empower individuals around disability.  Supporting this piece is revolutionary not only artistically: <strong>it is a radical statement in inclusivity, diversity, and creating space for new voices within the American artistic landscape</strong>.</p>

<h2>Creating ground-breaking work is complicated.</h2>
<p>Creating a new artistic piece is hard. Creating a new artistic piece that is revolutionary and groundbreaking is even harder.  <b>Odd Man Out</b> is a project that consists of a lot of moving pieces, both on the stage and behind the scenes. Many different people, ideas, and institutions across continents are coming together, and keeping a clear line of communication and management is key.

</div></div>","DUE TO THE CO-VID 19 PANDEMIC, ODD MAN OUT HAS BEEN POSTPONED TILL SPRING 2021. But rest assured, we can't wait to get it going!
 
Three international theater companies have come together to create a new, one-of-a-kind performance, experienced entirely in the dark. This new style, supported by a groundbreaking methodology that promotes inclusivity, innovation, and diversity, promises to completely change the face of American theater. 
And we need your help to make it happen. 
 
  
In a pitch-black room, a dying, blind Argentinian tango musician recalls the story of his life. What follows is a whirlwind of evocative, sensorial memories: his first braille lesson, his first day of school, his first love, his first heartbreak, and his journey across continents.  What does music sound like in the dark? How do you describe a color when you can’t see it? What does the color of our skin and the sound of our voices feel like? What do you see instead, when you can’t see? Experienced entirely in the dark, Odd Man Out’s world and characters are brought to life by six actors through a dynamic and immersive sound design, delicate choreography, and an innovative use of smell and touch. The production builds upon the groundbreaking performance style developed by Argentinian company, Teatro Ciego, and takes it to new and thrilling heights. The result is a completely immersive experience that awakens all the senses, unleashes the imagination, and stimulates each and every part of the body.
 

The piece is an international collaboration between two North American theatre companies, Theatre C and Cuchame Theatre Co, with recognized Argentinian theatre company, Teatro Ciego, who over its 15 year history has focused on creating pitch-black experiences developed and performed by blind and low-vision artists. In line with that mission, the US premiere of the piece in Fall 2020 will also include an American cast of majority blind and low-vision artists, bringing awareness to the creative impact of an often-ignored artistic community.

<p><b>Het verhaal van Isabel,</b>
<i style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">(English translation page down)</i></p><i>
</i><p><i><span style=""color: rgb(240, 0, 125); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">‘Als ik diep in een dans bezig ben, dan ben ik anders. Dan… dans ik mijn eigen verhaal en zit ik in een andere wereld...zo
gek!’</span></i><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p><p>Vier jaar is Isabel als ze in haar roze maillot en
balletpakje haar eerste vrolijke danspasjes maakt. Vanaf dat moment zijn al
haar dagen gevuld met dans en ballet. Nu, bijna twaalf jaar later, is er naast
die vrolijkheid ook een steeds dieper verlangen gegroeid om op een dag
professioneel te dansen.  </p>
<p>Isabel is 15 jaar en zit in het derde jaar van de
Havo/VWO voor Muziek en Dans (HMD) Codarts in Rotterdam. Naast haar normale
vakken volgt ze ruim 20 uur dansles per week. 
Ze werkt hard, maakt lange dagen en is inmiddels per bus en trein al 3,5
keer rond de wereld gereisd voor haar dansopleiding. En dit is nog maar het
begin.</p>
<p>Elke ochtend rond 
half 7 stapt Isabel in de bus, dan begint haar anderhalf uur durende
reis naar Rotterdam. ’s Avonds gaat ze dezelfde weg terug naar Wijk bij
Duurstede.  Zo werkt ze iedere dag
opnieuw keihard aan haar grote droom! </p>
<p>Waar veel kleine ballerina’s hun tutu uiteindelijk
verknippen tot feestaccessoire, hield Isabel onverzettelijk vast aan haar
droom. Nu haar idealen steeds meer binnen handbereik lijken te komen, is ze
meer dan ooit vastberaden door te gaan op deze weg. Koste wat het kost. Ze
blijft groeien als danser, en haar droom groeit ook!</p>
<p>Isabel haar ambitie is om ooit deel uit te maken van
haar grote voorbeeld; het Nederlandse Dans Theater (NDT). Isabel werd verliefd
op de combinatie van moderne dans en de hedendaagse en klassieke ballet van dit
gezelschap. Het geeft haar het gevoel dat je met kunst dingen kunt veranderen
en verrijken in de wereld.</p>
<p>Serieuze dansstudenten moeten ook hun zomers
verstandig gebruiken en niet alleen genieten van een ontspannen zomervakantie!  Isabel wil werken aan haar danscarrière en
volgt  een ‘Summer School’.  Daar verbetert ze haar vaardigheden en
kracht, en maakt ze nieuwe contacten in de danswereld. Het is een enorme
verrijking om een paar weken met andere gemotiveerde jonge dansers te trainen
onder leiding van inspirerende professionals. Deze zomer is Isabel geselecteerd
voor een Summer School van 2 weken bij de Dutch Don’t Dance Divison.</p>
<p>Het is uitdagend
om te geloven in haar dansdromen, maar tussen droom en daad staan praktische
bezwaren.</p>
<p>Isabel is nog te jong om op zichzelf te wonen, maar ze
heeft ook nog geen recht op een OV-studentenkaart. De reiskosten van het
openbaar vervoer van € 427,- per maand zijn voor ons een enorme kostenpost  om op te brengen naast de aanvullende kosten
die een dansopleiding toch al met zich mee brengen. </p>
<p></p>
<p><span><br/></span></p><p><span><b>De Campagne</b></span></p>
<p>Deze crowdfunding is een klein kunstproject geworden.
Twee getalenteerde jonge kunstenaars geloven net als wij in de droom van
Isabel. Zij hebben haar droom vastgelegd in bijzonder beeldmateriaal. Als
tegenprestatie voor uw donatie ontvangt u exclusieve gesigneerde foto‘s van
Isabel die in een industriële achtergrond bij de voormalige steenfabriek in
Wijk bij Duurstede zijn genomen. Hoe groter uw bijdrage hoe meer keuzevrijheid u
heeft en hoe artistieker de foto ’s worden.<br/></p>
<p>We vragen
een bijdrage in de studiekosten van Isabel. De grootste kostenpost; het
openbaar vervoer, dagelijks van Wijk bij Duurstede naar Rotterdam, wordt steeds
hoger. Ons totale doel is € 4.270,-. We hebben
bij Indigogo gekozen voor de flexibele variant van fundraising, zodat elke
bijdrage behouden blijft ook als we het einddoel niet bereiken. Eventuele extra bijdragen worden
gebruikt voor Isabel haar dansopleiding; bijvoorbeeld, dansschoenen en extra
balletlessen en workshops.</p><p><br/></p>

</i><p></p><p><i></i></p><p><i><i></i></i></p><p><i><i><i><span style=""color: rgb(240, 0, 125); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">""When I’m dancing, deeply concentrated, then I’ am different. Then… I dance my own story in a different world…, so strange!""
</span></i><br/></i></i></p>
<p></p><div><br/></div>

Isabel is four years old when she makes her first dance moves in her pink tights and
leotard. From that moment on her days are filled with dance and ballet. Now,
almost twelve years later, there is happiness but also a deeper desire to dance
professionally one day.<div>
<br/><i><i><i>
</i></i></i><p>Isabel is 15 years old and in the third year of HAVO/VWO for Music and Dance (HMD) Codarts in Rotterdam.
In addition to her regular courses, she follows at least 20 hours of dance
lessons per week. She works long days and so far, has travelled 3.5 times
around the world by bus and train to her dance training already. And this is
just the beginning.</p>
<p>Every morning at half past seven Isabel gets on the bus. That’s the beginning of her
one and a half hour daily journey to Rotterdam. She works hard for her big dream every day!</p>
<p>Where many little ballerinas eventually cut up their tutu into a party accessory,
Isabel remained dedicated to her dream. As her ideals seem to be more and more
within reach, the more she is determined to carry on this path. Whatever it
takes, she continues to grow as a dancer, like her dream does!</p>
<p>Isabel’s ambition is to be part of her role model one day; the Dutch Dance Theatre (Nederlands Dans Theater (NDT)). Isabel has fallen in love with the combination
of modern / contemporary dance and classical ballet of this company. It gives
her the feeling that you can change things with art and enrich the world.</p>
<p>Serious
dance students should also use their summers wisely, and don't just enjoy a laid
back summer! Isabel wants to work at her dancing career and follows a Summer
School. There she improves her skills and strength and  makes new contacts in the dance world. It is
an enormous enrichment to train a few weeks with other motivated young dancers
led by inspiring professionals. This summer Isabel has been selected for a
Summer School Course for 2 weeks at the ""Dutch Don't Dance Division”.</p>
<p>To
believe in her dance dreams is a challenge. However, there are all kinds of obstacles
on her way. Between dream and reality there are some practical obstacles.</p>
<p>Isabel
is still too young to live on her own and she is not entitled to a public
transport student pass till the age of 18. Raising the increasing travel
expenses of  <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> € 427, - per month is getting more and more difficult for her
family.</span></p>
<p><span><br/></span></p>
<p><span><b>The
Campaign Breakdown</b></span></p>
<p>This crowdfunding has become a small Art project.
Two talented young artists believe in Isabel’s dream just as we do. They have
transformed her dream into special and unique footage. In return for your
donation you'll receive exclusively autographed pictures of Isabel taken in a contrasting
industrial atmosphere at the former brickworks in Wijk bij Duurstede. The more
generous your contribution, the more choice you have in these pictures.</p>
<p>We
are crowdfunding for the increasing costs of Isabel’s dance study, travel expenses
in particular. Our goal is to raise €4.270,- We have chosen for the flexible variant of
fundraising by Indigogo, so every contribution will be used completely even if
we don’t achieve the ultimate goal. Extra contribution funds will go to Isabel’s
dancing study; for instance extra tuition (Classical Ballet at a RAD School,
workshops) and gear for Isabel's dance. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><i><span style=""color: rgb(240, 0, 125); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Support this 15 year old talented girl with a perk and receive one or more signed photographs! (Examples down this page).</span></i></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>We understand not everyone is able or willing to
donate. However you can help Isabel by making some “noise’’  about her campaign. Share! Spread the word! Use
the Indigogo “share” tools. Sharing her Indigogo page on Facebook,
Twitter, email or any other type of social media. Tell friends and family or
anyone who may want to fund a talented, young, hardworking dancer to achieve her
dream.</p>
<p>You
can also help us and other talented Dutch dancers to sign the petition for
public transportation for students following a Music and Dance education. So hopefully
our government will contribute in travel expenses for these students in the future. <a href=""https://petities.nl/petitie/geef-dans--en-muziektalenten-in-de-hbo-vooropleiding-een-ov-kaart/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Petities voor-ov-kaart</i></a><i></i></p>

Het verhaal van Isabel,
(English translation page down)
‘Als ik diep in een dans bezig ben, dan ben ik anders. Dan… dans ik mijn eigen verhaal en zit ik in een andere wereld...zo
gek!’

Vier jaar is Isabel als ze in haar roze maillot en
balletpakje haar eerste vrolijke danspasjes maakt. Vanaf dat moment zijn al
haar dagen gevuld met dans en ballet. Nu, bijna twaalf jaar later, is er naast
die vrolijkheid ook een steeds dieper verlangen gegroeid om op een dag
professioneel te dansen.  
Isabel is 15 jaar en zit in het derde jaar van de
Havo/VWO voor Muziek en Dans (HMD) Codarts in Rotterdam. Naast haar normale
vakken volgt ze ruim 20 uur dansles per week. 
Ze werkt hard, maakt lange dagen en is inmiddels per bus en trein al 3,5
keer rond de wereld gereisd voor haar dansopleiding. En dit is nog maar het
begin.
Elke ochtend rond 
half 7 stapt Isabel in de bus, dan begint haar anderhalf uur durende
reis naar Rotterdam. ’s Avonds gaat ze dezelfde weg terug naar Wijk bij
Duurstede.  Zo werkt ze iedere dag
opnieuw keihard aan haar grote droom! 
Waar veel kleine ballerina’s hun tutu uiteindelijk
verknippen tot feestaccessoire, hield Isabel onverzettelijk vast aan haar
droom. Nu haar idealen steeds meer binnen handbereik lijken te komen, is ze
meer dan ooit vastberaden door te gaan op deze weg. Koste wat het kost. Ze
blijft groeien als danser, en haar droom groeit ook!
Isabel haar ambitie is om ooit deel uit te maken van
haar grote voorbeeld; het Nederlandse Dans Theater (NDT). Isabel werd verliefd
op de combinatie van moderne dans en de hedendaagse en klassieke ballet van dit
gezelschap. Het geeft haar het gevoel dat je met kunst dingen kunt veranderen
en verrijken in de wereld.
Serieuze dansstudenten moeten ook hun zomers
verstandig gebruiken en niet alleen genieten van een ontspannen zomervakantie!  Isabel wil werken aan haar danscarrière en
volgt  een ‘Summer School’.  Daar verbetert ze haar vaardigheden en
kracht, en maakt ze nieuwe contacten in de danswereld. Het is een enorme
verrijking om een paar weken met andere gemotiveerde jonge dansers te trainen
onder leiding van inspirerende professionals. Deze zomer is Isabel geselecteerd
voor een Summer School van 2 weken bij de Dutch Don’t Dance Divison.
Het is uitdagend
om te geloven in haar dansdromen, maar tussen droom en daad staan praktische
bezwaren.
Isabel is nog te jong om op zichzelf te wonen, maar ze
heeft ook nog geen recht op een OV-studentenkaart. De reiskosten van het
openbaar vervoer van € 427,- per maand zijn voor ons een enorme kostenpost  om op te brengen naast de aanvullende kosten
die een dansopleiding toch al met zich mee brengen. 

De Campagne
Deze crowdfunding is een klein kunstproject geworden.
Twee getalenteerde jonge kunstenaars geloven net als wij in de droom van
Isabel. Zij hebben haar droom vastgelegd in bijzonder beeldmateriaal. Als
tegenprestatie voor uw donatie ontvangt u exclusieve gesigneerde foto‘s van
Isabel die in een industriële achtergrond bij de voormalige steenfabriek in
Wijk bij Duurstede zijn genomen. Hoe groter uw bijdrage hoe meer keuzevrijheid u
heeft en hoe artistieker de foto ’s worden.
We vragen
een bijdrage in de studiekosten van Isabel. De grootste kostenpost; het
openbaar vervoer, dagelijks van Wijk bij Duurstede naar Rotterdam, wordt steeds
hoger. Ons totale doel is € 4.270,-. We hebben
bij Indigogo gekozen voor de flexibele variant van fundraising, zodat elke
bijdrage behouden blijft ook als we het einddoel niet bereiken. Eventuele extra bijdragen worden
gebruikt voor Isabel haar dansopleiding; bijvoorbeeld, dansschoenen en extra
balletlessen en workshops.

Steun deze getalenteerde 15
jarige danseres door een donatie naar uw keuze!! Kies een van de Perks en ontvang één of meer
gesigneerde foto’s (voorbeelden onderaan deze pagina).

Andere manieren om te helpen
We
begrijpen dat niet iedereen kan of wil doneren. Toch kunt u wel Isabel helpen
door ruchtbaarheid aan haar campagne te geven. Gebruik de Indigogo knop, deel
het op Facebook, Twitter, email of andere vorm van sociale media. Deel dit
bericht met vrienden en familie of iemand anders die kan helpen om de droom van
deze getalenteerde, jonge hardwerkende danseres te vervullen. 
Ook kunt
u ons en andere getalenteerde dansers helpen om de petitie voor OV
reismogelijkheid voor DAMU studenten te ondertekenen, zodat wellicht de
overheid in de toekomst zorg draagt voor reismogelijkheden voor studenten op de
opleiding Muziek en dans. Petities voor-ov-kaart
Hartelijk dank voor uw bijdrage!

Isabel’s Story 
(English translation)
""When I’m dancing, deeply concentrated, then I’ am different. Then… I dance my own story in a different world…, so strange!""



Isabel is four years old when she makes her first dance moves in her pink tights and
leotard. From that moment on her days are filled with dance and ballet. Now,
almost twelve years later, there is happiness but also a deeper desire to dance
professionally one day.

Isabel is 15 years old and in the third year of HAVO/VWO for Music and Dance (HMD) Codarts in Rotterdam.
In addition to her regular courses, she follows at least 20 hours of dance
lessons per week. She works long days and so far, has travelled 3.5 times
around the world by bus and train to her dance training already. And this is
just the beginning.
Every morning at half past seven Isabel gets on the bus. That’s the beginning of her
one and a half hour daily journey to Rotterdam. She works hard for her big dream every day!
Where many little ballerinas eventually cut up their tutu into a party accessory,
Isabel remained dedicated to her dream. As her ideals seem to be more and more
within reach, the more she is determined to carry on this path. Whatever it
takes, she continues to grow as a dancer, like her dream does!
Isabel’s ambition is to be part of her role model one day; the Dutch Dance Theatre (Nederlands Dans Theater (NDT)). Isabel has fallen in love with the combination
of modern / contemporary dance and classical ballet of this company. It gives
her the feeling that you can change things with art and enrich the world.
Serious
dance students should also use their summers wisely, and don't just enjoy a laid
back summer! Isabel wants to work at her dancing career and follows a Summer
School. There she improves her skills and strength and  makes new contacts in the dance world. It is
an enormous enrichment to train a few weeks with other motivated young dancers
led by inspiring professionals. This summer Isabel has been selected for a
Summer School Course for 2 weeks at the ""Dutch Don't Dance Division”.
To
believe in her dance dreams is a challenge. However, there are all kinds of obstacles
on her way. Between dream and reality there are some practical obstacles.
Isabel
is still too young to live on her own and she is not entitled to a public
transport student pass till the age of 18. Raising the increasing travel
expenses of   € 427, - per month is getting more and more difficult for her
family.

The
Campaign Breakdown
This crowdfunding has become a small Art project.
Two talented young artists believe in Isabel’s dream just as we do. They have
transformed her dream into special and unique footage. In return for your
donation you'll receive exclusively autographed pictures of Isabel taken in a contrasting
industrial atmosphere at the former brickworks in Wijk bij Duurstede. The more
generous your contribution, the more choice you have in these pictures.
We
are crowdfunding for the increasing costs of Isabel’s dance study, travel expenses
in particular. Our goal is to raise €4.270,- We have chosen for the flexible variant of
fundraising by Indigogo, so every contribution will be used completely even if
we don’t achieve the ultimate goal. Extra contribution funds will go to Isabel’s
dancing study; for instance extra tuition (Classical Ballet at a RAD School,
workshops) and gear for Isabel's dance. 

Support this 15 year old talented girl with a perk and receive one or more signed photographs! (Examples down this page).

Other Ways You Can Help
We understand not everyone is able or willing to
donate. However you can help Isabel by making some “noise’’  about her campaign. Share! Spread the word! Use
the Indigogo “share” tools. Sharing her Indigogo page on Facebook,
Twitter, email or any other type of social media. Tell friends and family or
anyone who may want to fund a talented, young, hardworking dancer to achieve her
dream.
You
can also help us and other talented Dutch dancers to sign the petition for
public transportation for students following a Music and Dance education. So hopefully
our government will contribute in travel expenses for these students in the future. Petities voor-ov-kaart

Thank you for your help!

Blood Speaks is a stage production for the whole family, dynamically incorporating multimedia, mass choirs, dances and drama! Focused on the powerful message of forgiveness and reconciliation, it's a huge community project with hundreds of people from surrounding areas taking part. It touches on some historical events such as the Armenian Genocide, Pope Gregory, and the World Wars.In 2013, it was performed
for the first time, with an amazing response from the crowds. The follow up production in 2014 was also packed! 
Now, in 2015 - we are going even BIGGER! On 9, 10 & 11 April, it will be performed in the SAND DU PLESSIS THEATER which, by the way, is the biggest theater in the Free State. With this, we hope to impact 3000 people in three nights! Along with this, Blood Speaks is going to every province in South Africa! A team of 12 passionate people (cast and crew) are hitting the road with a NATIONWIDE BLOOD SPEAKS TOUR!   TOUR DATESTerm 1 (January - March): Free State and Northern CapeTerm 2 (April - June): GautengTerm 3 (July- September): Mpumalanga, North West and LimpopoTerm 4 (October - December): Kwa-Zulu Natal, Western and Eastern Cape

LASTLY- If you were wondering WHY we are doing this, here it is: 

South Africa is in a critical time: 20 years post apartheid, but still repercussions of the past can be seen. South Africa needs this message. The positive impact it made in the lives of people and the feedback we received from the 2013 and 2014 shows was overwhelming! Building a better future is something people believe in, and also what we as a team believe in. 
Blood Speaks touches on events in history, and how we can interpret them- coming back to the central message of forgiveness. 
2015 also marks the 100 year anniversary of the Armenian Genocide - the world will have something to say.
Hitler's interpretation of history led to an even more “bloody” history in WORLD WAR II. He manipulated and motivated Germany to kill millions of Jews by referring back to the Armenian tragedy with the fact that the world did nothing when that happened, saying: “Who after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians?” 
Factual history in Blood Speaks encourages the audience to choose wisely between the two lines of thought – to build or to destroy.
The production is neither politically motivated, nor about the genocide, nor a documentary, but uses these events to bring awareness of our “bloody” past, present and (if we don’t change) the future. It points to the blood of Jesus Christ as the ultimate example of forgiveness.",1.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 26px;"">Curtain Calls Theater Group was founded in an effort to address what we felt was a need in our community. Theater for children is very hard to find in our school district at the elementary school district. Since 2011, we have strived to bring theater to the elementary school level. We started out with the Wizard of Oz and have added shows such as Alice in Wonderland, The Trials of Robin Hood and The Grimm Brothers Spectaculathon.

Curtain Calls Theater Group was founded in an effort to address what we felt was a need in our community. Theater for children is very hard to find in our school district at the elementary school district. Since 2011, we have strived to bring theater to the elementary school level. We started out with the Wizard of Oz and have added shows such as Alice in Wonderland, The Trials of Robin Hood and The Grimm Brothers Spectaculathon. Each of our shows is run by our students, from the bottom to the top. Our students run the sound, lighting and  help design the sets and costumes. All to often children theater gets a bum rap. It brings visions of paper costumes and kids with their lines in their hands. This is the negative stereotype that our kids were meant to disprove. We put our trust in our kids and they definitely produce. Nothing like a ten year old learning 300 plus lines and playing to a packed house to show people what kids can do! 
Our programs were so well received that we expanded out to a nearby middle school as well, further expanding our ability to introduce theater. This is strictly a volunteer operation. One hundred percent of our raised funds goes back into the program to enrich these students lives. To date over 500 students have passed through our programs and experienced the joys of the stage.

format of curating several unique acts within one show and use it to
present different themes or concepts that we are interested in. In
the past year or so, many people we know went though some tough times
mentally. Looking at our wider community within the events and
festival industry there have been a few casualties who we will never
see again and more who almost went the same way. Usually the Artful
Badger is known for our light hearted, sexy, playful exuberance, but
this year we wanted to see what would happen if the Artful Badger
used our mischievous, wild nature to explore the darker sides of
humanity. The biggest barrier to recovery is hiding, not connecting,
not showing your weakness. We believe that it is important to have
permission to feel and experience the dark sides in order to
overcome them.</p>

<p>What makes this special:</p>
<p>The show includes Aedin Walsh has is traveled from Sweden to
develop her physical theatre/aerial act with a unique net structure
that moves within the space. No one else in the world has this so it
really is a new progression in aerial performance. We have developed
a brand new piece for the last act of the show with Follow the Faun
featuring the amazing projections by Jack Weir &amp; wall dancing
aerial performance with Zoë Cobb.  Again a unique and spectacular
development for all the artists.  Most importantly the audience takes
part in this show and we can promise that despite the subject matter
of the show will leave feeling amazing, invigorated and alive!

<p>
Every bit of the budget covers the
production of the show: Includes multiple projections, a unique one

the PR needed to sell all the tickets, projectors, designers &amp;

About the Show:
Wild Worlds: Dark Sides is a physical theatre show comprised of a
curated collection of acts exploring the animal instinct of the human
condition.
Originally Wild Worlds was conceived as a one off for
VAULT Festival 2014. This year we realised that we wanted to keep the
format of curating several unique acts within one show and use it to
present different themes or concepts that we are interested in. In
the past year or so, many people we know went though some tough times
mentally. Looking at our wider community within the events and

<div>Johnny, Tunny and Will struggle to find meaning in a post-9/11 world. When the three disgruntled men flee the constraints of their hometown for the thrills of city life, their paths are quickly estranged when Tunny enters the armed forces, Will is called back home to attend familial responsibilities, and Johnny's attention becomes divided by a seductive love interest and a hazardous new friendship. An energy-fueled rock opera, American Idiot, features little dialogue and instead relies on the lyrics from Green Day's groundbreaking album to execute the story line. </div>
<div></div>Founded in 1995 by owner Bruce Grossman, the Cultural Arts Playhouse of Plainview, Roslyn Heights and Wantagh is a year round off-off Broadway style theater that has produced over 500 productions including educational and touring shows. Named by Long Island Press as one of Long Island’s Best Live Theaters, the theater serves more than 20,000 people each year with its professional adult productions, children’s theater performances, and theater education classes for ages 7-18.  Along with its Musical Theater and Acting Academy (MTAA) and Young People’s Theater (YPT) more than 5000 students have had the opportunity to learn from the finest instructors in the New York area. With the over 150 years of combined experience of it staff, many of CAP’s students and performers have been able to use their CAP experiences and use the talents they have learned to do professional theater, recordings, television and film.<div><br/></div>

<p>Both Obadiah Wright and I,
Alessandro Cirafici, are starting our fourth year at Bard College. Being
members of the College’s Conservatory of Music, we are working to complete a
dual degree program which involves our studies in the Conservatory alongside
our studies in an academic field. As part of the requirements for our college
degree, we are required to write a Senior Thesis. Per my second major (I am a
German Studies major) and my desire to connect my academic and conservatory
studies, I am collaborating with Obadiah to write and produce an Opera for the Spring of 2016. For this project, I am responsible for writing the Libretto
while Obadiah is responsible for writing the music; both Obadiah and I are also
co-producers for this opera.</p>
<p>Since the Spring of 2014, both Obadiah and I
have been collaborating to prepare each aspect of the project. Since then, we
have put into motion a project involving a 40 piece orchestra and cast, and a
14 person production crew. Our goal is to raise the money to produce this opera
and perform it at the Rhinebeck Performing Arts Center, which we are renting
from March 31<sup>st</sup>-April 2<sup>nd</sup> of the 2016 year for the
performance and tech rehearsals. In order to succeed with this project, we are
hoping to raise $10,000 in order to pay for the rent of the hall, all
production costs and subsequent budgets for internal works such as costuming
and set, and in order to pay our production team, cast, and orchestra. </p>

junior at the Bard College Conservatory of Music studying Oboe under the
direction of Elaine Douvas and Alexandra Knoll along with prior instruction
from Richard Dallessio and Nicholas Stovall. Regularly appearing in
performances with the Bard College Conservatory Orchestra—those performances
including its performances at Avery Fisher Hall, and performances at the Woodbourne
Correctional Facility in Woodbourne, New York through their Prison Initiative Program—Mr.
Cirafici has performed in numerous Chamber Ensembles—with the most recent
performance of the Maslanka 3rd wind Quintet at the Hartt School of Music under
the guidance of Peter Serkin, Laura Flax, and David Wakefield. Mr. Cirafici also makes frequent appearances with the Conservatory
Baroque Ensemble under the direction of Dr. Alexander Bonus, performing a wide
range of composers from Giovanni Paolo Cima to Pergolesi along with major known
works such as Bach’s St. Johns Passion, Magnificat, and Handel’s Esther
Oratorio. Along with his studies in the Conservatory, Mr. Cirafici is pursuing
a second degree in German Studies.

While many are familiar with the character from 'The Berlin Stories' further popularised by Kander &amp; Ebb's musical and of course Fosse's film starring Liza Minelli, few are aware that the character was based upon the 'divinely decadent' Jean Ross.</p><p>With her green-painted nails and a string of lovers, Ross (who roomed in the same house as Isherwood) was indeed 'divinely decadent' but far from the air-headed floozy in the stories. Born in Egypt, RADA-trained and allergic to conventionality, she became a respected political journalist who filed reports from the siege of Madrid in the Spanish Civil War and brought up (as a single mother) a daughter who herself overturned convention. Along the way she was also the muse for a German pianist on his way to Hollywood, and of the lyricist Eric Maschwitz – his song These Foolish Things, written about Ross after their affair ended, is among the authentic songs featured in the production.  </p><p>This new one woman musical telling the story of Jean Ross previews on May 29/30/31 at Brighton Fringe ahead of a three week run at the Edinburgh Fringe. The show was developed from a concept - 'A Dozen Roses' - that performed in 2014 based upon the idea of what happened after 'Cabaret'. While researching Jean Ross, we felt that this formidable lady's rich life was perfect for a new, entertaining work.<br/></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The show features a fantastic three piece jazz band performing songs of the era by Cole Porter, Rodgers &amp; Hart and Kurt Weill and we hope you enjoy this campaign's video of the previous show's highlights featuring Producer and Performer, Sophie Jugé and Writer and Musical Director, Gez Kahan.</span><br/></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">MUSE is the first in a series of new shows by Jugé Productions about inspiring women of the 1930s. For Writer and Musical Director Gez Kahan, the varied lifestyles and nationalities of the characters provide an opportunity to create witty and entertaining works infused with multi-linguistic delights which perfectly suit this European production company.</span><br/></p><p>Producer and Performer Sophie Jugé is taking on the challenge of playing the formidable Jean Ross, contrasting her free-spirited youth and diverse experiences with her subsequent more private personal life.</p><blockquote>“<i>Jean Ross is a fantastic role to play. I feel the responsibility to pique the audience’s interest in this lady accented by the great songs in our new show.</i>”  - Sophie Jugé</blockquote><p>Following previews at Brighton Fringe this May, a MUSE gala preview plays for one night at the Kenton Theatre in Henley-on-Thames. We have put together a Gala Sponsor Perk especially for this event.</p><h1><b>The Team</b></h1><p><b></b></p><p>If you are kind enough to support this project, you can do so knowing that the performing Company is an experienced team of creatives dedicated to making MUSE a success.

While many are familiar with the character from 'The Berlin Stories' further popularised by Kander & Ebb's musical and of course Fosse's film starring Liza Minelli, few are aware that the character was based upon the 'divinely decadent' Jean Ross.With her green-painted nails and a string of lovers, Ross (who roomed in the same house as Isherwood) was indeed 'divinely decadent' but far from the air-headed floozy in the stories. Born in Egypt, RADA-trained and allergic to conventionality, she became a respected political journalist who filed reports from the siege of Madrid in the Spanish Civil War and brought up (as a single mother) a daughter who herself overturned convention. Along the way she was also the muse for a German pianist on his way to Hollywood, and of the lyricist Eric Maschwitz – his song These Foolish Things, written about Ross after their affair ended, is among the authentic songs featured in the production.  This new one woman musical telling the story of Jean Ross previews on May 29/30/31 at Brighton Fringe ahead of a three week run at the Edinburgh Fringe. The show was developed from a concept - 'A Dozen Roses' - that performed in 2014 based upon the idea of what happened after 'Cabaret'. While researching Jean Ross, we felt that this formidable lady's rich life was perfect for a new, entertaining work.The show features a fantastic three piece jazz band performing songs of the era by Cole Porter, Rodgers & Hart and Kurt Weill and we hope you enjoy this campaign's video of the previous show's highlights featuring Producer and Performer, Sophie Jugé and Writer and Musical Director, Gez Kahan.MUSE is the first in a series of new shows by Jugé Productions about inspiring women of the 1930s. For Writer and Musical Director Gez Kahan, the varied lifestyles and nationalities of the characters provide an opportunity to create witty and entertaining works infused with multi-linguistic delights which perfectly suit this European production company.Producer and Performer Sophie Jugé is taking on the challenge of playing the formidable Jean Ross, contrasting her free-spirited youth and diverse experiences with her subsequent more private personal life.“Jean Ross is a fantastic role to play. I feel the responsibility to pique the audience’s interest in this lady accented by the great songs in our new show.”  - Sophie JugéFollowing previews at Brighton Fringe this May, a MUSE gala preview plays for one night at the Kenton Theatre in Henley-on-Thames. We have put together a Gala Sponsor Perk especially for this event.The TeamIf you are kind enough to support this project, you can do so knowing that the performing Company is an experienced team of creatives dedicated to making MUSE a success.

<div>
<p>Bgirls Do It Better is one of the only events inside hip hop culture dedicated to the women in hip hop: to bgirls, female DJs and graffiti writers and hopefully in future also for female MCs.<br/></p>
<p>Bgirls Do It Better is a very unique event. It only happens once a year and it is extremely important platform for women in hip hop to meet, greet and exchange.</p>
<p>We haven't found any sponsors this year, so we try to make it happen with crowdfunding. Please support!</p>
</div>
<h3>Bgirls Do It Better in short...</h3> <p></p>
<p>For the past two years we have successfully organised a unique event that the Slovenian dance scene had never witnessed before: Around the date of International Women's Day (8th of March) we have held an event that was aimed specifically at all the girls and women of the culture known as hip hop. </p>
<p></p>
<p>
Our aim is to help female dancers from all over the world to get to know each other, give them an opportunity to show what they're made of and raise the general level of female participation in hip hop.</p>
<p>We dare say that these events have had a positive impact on the vibe of Slovenia's as well as whole Europe's bgirl scene.</p>
<p>The success and positive feedback inspired us to the point of transforming what was then a once-in-a-lifetime event into an annual event. And so we are proud to announce that the next B-Girls Do It Better will take place on Saturday, 5th of March 2016.</p>
<p>For making it happen we would like to ask for your help in funding this project!</p>

Why Bgirls Do It Better?
Bgirls because it is our expression for females in breakdancing, Do It Better because we do it better :)


   ...We Do It Better but we need funds for making it happen All the funds we get will go into organising the event. More specifically for:


Renting out the place for the jam
Paying for the DJs and the DJ equipment rental
Paying for invited bgirls travel costs to get to the event and their accommodation costs in Ljubljana
Making the posters, flyers, stickers, T-shirts and other marketing material for the event and paying the designer(s)
Making the prizes for the winner(s)




    Why are we doing this? 
As we know, breakdance is a predominantly male sport and you can claim something similar for other elements of hiphop. Because of that, Bgirls Do It Better is dedicated particularly to the development of female participation in hiphop culture. It's the first event of its kind in Slovenia.

Cooperation is very important, on a local level GOR works together with other youth and cultural organisations such as Zavod BOB, Zavod O, JKZM Medvode and MOL (The Municipality of Ljubljana); besides that GOR connects and collaborates in Erasmus+ projects on an international level through the Europe du Hip Hop partnership. The motto is Saaaaaam' GOR (Oooooonly UP)! 


   Please share the love!
   We value donations highly 'cause we really want to make Bgirls Do It Better III to happen. But even if you can't support us financially please show your love by sharing the campaign.Thank you!Oooooonly UP!",5.0,0,"2 Campaigns

they performed in a gala festival organized by actress Vanessa Redgrave on

far north as the Ekati diamond mines in the Northwest Territories, and as far
south as Arizona, Alabama, Florida and the Appalachian coal mining communities
of Kentucky, Virginia and Pennsylvania. The group was even invited to perform

<p><b>THE SAVOY THEATRE - SOME HISTORY
</b></p>
<p>In 2015, the Savoy Theatre entered its 88th year of providing cultural entertainment to Cape Breton Island. Established in 1927, the Savoy Theatre first opened as a live performance venue and hosted acts of every kind until the mid 1950's when it became a movie theatre.  By the early 1970's the Savoy had fallen into a state of disrepair and was refurbished by the Town of Glace Bay. The Savoy Theatre reopened its doors in 1976 as ""Cape Breton's Entertainment Show Place."" </p>
<b>
</b><p>Today, the Savoy Theatre plays an essential role in the local community, providing an opportunity for residents and visitors alike to enjoy a great diversity of entertainment. From community Remembrance Day services to debut recitals of young local dancers, the Savoy presents and produces over 150 events per year and admits more than 30,000 people annually. <br/><br/>The majority of Savoy performers are Cape Breton artists, many of whom got their start at the Savoy.  We have been honoured to have the best of the best at the Savoy including Rita MacNeil,  Men of the Deeps, The Barra MacNeils, J.P. Cormier, The Rankin Family, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAh5h9-XlII"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ashley MacIssac </a>and Natalie MacMaster. The Savoy Theatre also attracts national and international performers, some of which include Blue

Hello everyone! 
We are the HomoLudens Theatre Group from Greece. 
We are all professional performers and artists from various artistic fields (theater, fine art, music, design, architecture) that bring in and combine our experiences into theatrical performances. 
We first met and worked together in 2015 when we were selected by the National Theatre of Greece to participate in the Platform for Young Creators (via a national competition). We are now creating our new theater piece based on Stratis Myrivilis' three short stories (""Οι γοργόνες"", ""Δευκαλίων"", ""Μια μαχαιριά"") taken from ""The Green Book"". 
Myrivilis' wittyfull writting has been a great source of inspiration for us. It speaks directly to the heart about fundamental issues. It arises a wide range of sentiments and recalls profound matters about life, one's purpose, expectations, love. 
The 3 stories we selected from the Green Book, shine light onto these matters and invite each one of us to recall our own personal matters and thus inspires us back. 
Stratis Myrivilis is considered a great Greek writer belonging to the 1930's generation. The similarities of his times and today's world are strong: unstable social-political environments, immigration waves, financial instability, etc.  
We, as a theater group, stand with curiosity and will of investigation on human existence back in the 30's and how many aspects of life are still relevant and almost identical to today's world. 
Why we ask for your help?
We believe that both we and you, creators and audience, can benefit by making this theatre performance a reality. It means a lot to us to share with the audience great stories of the past that are still relevant today. And we know that for the audience is equally important to discover old and new theatrical pieces, stories and novels that can actually bring something positive.
Theatre is our passion and we need to keep the flame lit and be able to keep practicing our profession in a decent and responsible way.  

Myrivillis Project will be premiering on the 11th of February 2016

   What We Need   In these times of financial crisis, we, the HomoLudens Theater Company, finance our productions ourselves. We do all actions possible to support our theatre creation but we also count on help by willing friends. 
The financial contribution that we will receive will be used entirely and solely to cover and past and future expenses.
Here is a short list of our expenses:
Rehearsal costs,
Theatre rent,

Sceneries,
Costumes,
Materials,
Advertising. 
We do not care about luxurious sceneries or costumes, we care about basic conditions: to work successfully and to live with dignity.  Considering the fact that it is a difficult time for anyone, we have placed some perks that may fit to any contributor's budget. Even 1 euro is a great support for us. 
There's a greek saying that goes ""fasouli to fasouli gemizei to sakouli"" (""φασούλι το φασούλι γεμίζει το σακούλι""), which literally translates to ""bean by bean the sack is filled"".  It's about how each bean (φασούλι) can gradually stack up a stock large enough to feed you.

</h3> <p><i>Please note: if you want to donate more than a perk then you need to put it through as two separate donations!</i></p>
<p>I ask myself that question every day...<br/></p>
<p>Hi, I'm Koraly, and I've written opinion / personal articles for publications such as <i>Daily Life</i> (Fairfax), <i>Rendezview </i>(Newscorp), <i>SBS</i>, <i>The Age</i>, <i>The Sydney Morning Herald, The Saturday Paper, Junkee, Mamamia</i> and the list goes on. </p>
<p>But in my spare time I'm a poet, actor, theatre and screen maker and the author of a poetry bestseller, with rights sold to the UK and the book was also translated into Greek thanks to an Australia Council ArtStart grant. <i>Love and F Poems</i>, just like all my artistic works, explore feminism and women claiming their identity and space.  </p>
<p>That's where my theatre show comes in. </p>

I ask myself that question every day...
Hi, I'm Koraly, and I've written opinion / personal articles for publications such as Daily Life (Fairfax), Rendezview (Newscorp), SBS, The Age, The Sydney Morning Herald, The Saturday Paper, Junkee, Mamamia and the list goes on. 
But in my spare time I'm a poet, actor, theatre and screen maker and the author of a poetry bestseller, with rights sold to the UK and the book was also translated into Greek thanks to an Australia Council ArtStart grant. Love and F Poems, just like all my artistic works, explore feminism and women claiming their identity and space.  
That's where my theatre show comes in.

We are seeking to raise $18,000 through this campaign which will allow us to put up the best presentation of the musical in the Los Angeles area and help to pay for the cost of the cast and creative team. A more detailed description of our costs is listed below under Our Budget.
Any additional funding raised past our goal will go to the Laity Arts Foundation's LEAP Afterschool program which teaches children in grades k-8 in Animation, Dance, Music, Drama and the Visual Arts.
In the case where the funding goal is not reached, funds received will go towards the full production. All of the donations for this campaign will be handled by FirstGiving, Indiegogo's nonprofit payments processor. FirstGiving will then disburse funds directly to the Laity Arts Foundation accounting department who will make sure all money is allocated to all areas in the budget section.



Our Impact Together - WIN WIN!
Way Back When is a modern take on a very old art form (Comedia dell'arte) written in a classical (Shakespearean) manner using modern dialogue and music. The forth wall is broken in this musical and brings a Renaissance Faire feel to the stage and theatre. This is a wonderful piece of theatre which should have seen the light of a LA stage years ago. It appears that now is the time!
This is a real opportunity to help bring a unique and worthy piece of musical theatre to the stage. Your contribution to support this project also has a greater impact than just producing a musical. Remember, if we surpass our goal all additional funds go to the Laity Arts LEAP afterschool program.




Our Budget
The money will be used specifically for the following areas:




Insurance: $500

Transportation: $1500
Actors: $3,000
Musicians: $2,000
Staff: $2,000
Rehearsal Space: $3,000 (6 weeks in LA)
Advertising/Marketing: $2,500
Programs/Scripts: $1000
Props/Set: $2000

Find the Perk that fit's your pocket and let's get this show to New York!

<b>You can leave a broken home, but can you ever really escape it? </b><br/>
<b><br/></b><p><b>WHAT IS THIS STORY ABOUT?<i>""[The Glass] Menagerie
 reveals the story of family members whose lives form a triangle of 
quiet desperation, each struggling with an individual version of hell 
while simultaneously seeking escape from the gravity of each other's 
pathologies.""  <i>—</i>  </i>Robert Bray<br/> <br/><b>And in this quiet triangle of desperation, lives a story about three people who love each other. <b><b>Tennessee Williams writes about the universal. <br/>We are raising money to shed light on something you thought you knew - home. </b></b></b><i>""How beautiful it is and how easily it can be broken""</i>  <i>—</i> The Glass Menagerie.<b><br/><br/>This
 is a Canadian Production of
Tennessee William’s classic. It explores the plight of the single mother
 raising two adult children on her own. Williams offers to the audience,
 something we can examine and digest
through tears and laughter. <br/></b></b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<b>Why is this play relevant today?</b>
<p>Today,
the electronic world is changing into the digital world. There is revolution
and evolution going on as a result, and the whole nuclear family concept is in
great flux. Individualism versus collectivism is an ongoing debate and a
paramount theme in the breakdown of the family unit.  </p>
<p>It
is significant to take something like THE GLASS MENAGERIE, and mount it at this
particular time because it is a great metaphor for change and reflective of all
things topical. It looks both backward and forward in time, outward and inward.
It depicts heroes and victims that we can all relate to. As John Lahr states,
“it also broadcasts William’s dramatic goal – to redeem life, through beauty,
from the humiliation of grief.”</p>

society is changing. Chekhov and the revolution. Shakespeare and the 
Renaissance. Homer, Euripides and Aristophanes in Greece and the city 
states. Williams and the end of the Antebellum period and WWI. The 
beginning of post-war future. We are in this similar kind of transition 
now. The world is changing hugely. The ""Dinosaurs"" are like Amanda 
holding desperately on to the past and with that holding on some people 
will be sacrificed. Like Laura is. Like Syrians and natives in Africa. 
Amanda is a terrifying person, but she's funny. So are dinosaurs.<br/></p>

</div><br/></div>","""Enthusiasm is the most important thing in life.""  — Tennessee Williams
                            A timeless masterpiece.  An innovative collaboration. 
                            

            
You can leave a broken home, but can you ever really escape it? 
WHAT IS THIS STORY ABOUT?""[The Glass] Menagerie
 reveals the story of family members whose lives form a triangle of 
quiet desperation, each struggling with an individual version of hell 
while simultaneously seeking escape from the gravity of each other's 
pathologies.""  —  Robert Bray And in this quiet triangle of desperation, lives a story about three people who love each other. Tennessee Williams writes about the universal. We are raising money to shed light on something you thought you knew - home. ""How beautiful it is and how easily it can be broken""  — The Glass Menagerie.This
 is a Canadian Production of
Tennessee William’s classic. It explores the plight of the single mother
 raising two adult children on her own. Williams offers to the audience,
 something we can examine and digest
through tears and laughter. 

Why is this play relevant today?
Today,
the electronic world is changing into the digital world. There is revolution
and evolution going on as a result, and the whole nuclear family concept is in
great flux. Individualism versus collectivism is an ongoing debate and a
paramount theme in the breakdown of the family unit.  
It
is significant to take something like THE GLASS MENAGERIE, and mount it at this
particular time because it is a great metaphor for change and reflective of all
things topical. It looks both backward and forward in time, outward and inward.
It depicts heroes and victims that we can all relate to. As John Lahr states,
“it also broadcasts William’s dramatic goal – to redeem life, through beauty,
from the humiliation of grief.”

WHY TELL THIS STORY TODAY?From director Mel Tuck: The greatest playwrights come forward when 
society is changing. Chekhov and the revolution. Shakespeare and the 
Renaissance. Homer, Euripides and Aristophanes in Greece and the city 
states. Williams and the end of the Antebellum period and WWI. The 
beginning of post-war future. We are in this similar kind of transition 
now. The world is changing hugely. The ""Dinosaurs"" are like Amanda 
holding desperately on to the past and with that holding on some people 
will be sacrificed. Like Laura is. Like Syrians and natives in Africa. 
Amanda is a terrifying person, but she's funny. So are dinosaurs.

                                        Karen Austin (as Laura) and Director Mel Tuck (as Tom) - 1968And so...When a writer tells a story that has to be told...
  

                      When a director lifts the vision off the page and creates a world in which we are   transported to...                                     
                                                                  Director Mel Tuck
        

When an actor artfully and truthful inhabits a character, humanizing the written experience...  

     

When the atmosphere of a play is enhanced by the subtle dynamics of light and sound...
           Here he is by the way, our composer extraordinaire... DAVID CIERI
     

When the set illuminates social and economic, private and public, personal 
and political tensions of a world written by TENNESSEE WILLIAMS...
                                         
                            Stage and Costume Designer (Diana Capstick- Dale)  
THEATRE IS ELECTRIFYING. This is something to strive for, isn't it? 


WHY THEATRE?



In an age where most communication is through some media filter 
like the Internet, Twitter, Facebook, Google, Television and Film, there
 is something spiritual in people sitting and focused in a direction and
 exploring the human experience in a human manner whether it's through 
humor or drama. The energy of the live experience transcends anything 
mechanical. We need to keep our ears as alert and active as our eyes. 
And our brains and senses as sharp as we possibly can. The live 
experience is the source.— Director Mel Tuck

WHY ARE WE RAISING MONEY?We started small as an 
independent company, in an effort to create a unified approach to the 
work, selecting evocative material well-suited to the company and written by the greats.

RISKS and CHALLENGES:

When we think of theatre towns, we conjure up the image of New York,
 London, Berlin, and Toronto, but productions and audiences are 
everywhere. Is there demand in Vancouver? YES, YES, YES!
When we think of talent or artistry...  we know that these traits 
are not limited to any one time or place... Why can't Vancouver be as 
prolific as any other theatre town? 
This is a play in which past and
present tensions manifest on stage, as they do in a dysfunctional family
dynamic. While our production is a classical rendering of a classical play,
every aspect of it is relevant to a modern audience. We believe the best way to
do this is to honor what we call “The Williams’ Aesthetic”. The major challenge in this approach
is to create with utmost specificity, the world in which Williams writes about.
Specificity in story-telling is universally effective. To meet the demands of
this challenge, we have started our process long in advance and this has
included dramaturgical studies of the play/playwright. Williams’ family life
occupies a huge presence in this play and there is great information at our
disposal. We have also created a marriage between veterans and young
professionals of the theatre as our ensemble consists of both. This dynamic has
already created a kind of work ethic and synergy that has proven very
effective.

theatre production and monthly improvised comedy shows! </p>
<p>We need your help to raise enough

<h3>So
where do you come in?</h3>
<p>As a non-profit theatre company, our funds are always limited
and your donation will help do justice to the productions we are creating this

<p>We are a small team, but we are very
committed to the success of these projects. We are dedicated to giving our
audiences something they will enjoy and providing high-quality theatre to the
interior of British Columbia. That being said, even with your support the
finding and building of costumes and props needed for <i>Knights of the Sun:
Medieval Tournament Theatre </i>is extremely costly and time consuming.
Luckily, we have the help of some local industry professionals who are working
to mentor the younger members of our company. <br/>
<br/>
We are also rehearsing in three different locations and performing in four
different places throughout the summer between the two projects! Between travel
costs, rehearsal hall and venue costs and travel expenses, we are trying to
balance the accelerated growth of our company. Because of this, we are always
looking for volunteers to help support our company. If you're interested in
volunteering for Chimera Theatre, please email us at info@chimeratheatre.com. </p>

<p>“<b>Πλας ντε λα Κονκόρντ - Plateia Omonoias -Concord</b>” is a site specific physical theatre
performance, selected to be a part of the In Progress Feedback Festival (recognized by the
EFFE International Jury as one of Europe’s finest festivals) in Athens. “Concord” is an
international collaboration between Greek, Indian and Lithuanian artists, hosted and
coordinated by us, an Athens based theatre group called Simmoria tou iliou (Gang of the
Sun).
</p>
<p></p>This physical theatre performance will take place at Omonia square (Omonia means ‘unity’ in Greek), a busy street in Athens where we will explore meetings in urban spaces, hoping to offer joy, love and hope in these conflict and despair ridden times.</div>
<div> Even though In Progress Feedback Festival provides us with the fantastic opportunity to perform in public spaces in Athens, yet it is unable to provide any financial support. Our project, would not be possible without monetary aid as this is a free for all public art project, a non commercial venture. We seek your assistance to help us put together a performance that is not for a select few but attempts to create a joyous surprise and a sense of community for all passers by at the city square.</div>

<p>This year the theme of the In Progress Feedback Festival is ‘Urban Surprises’. We have
chosen Omonia Square for our performance with the aim of creating a performance that
explores playfulness and acceptance of diversity in a busy public place. Our objective is to
revive, invoke and play games that we used to as children. We were inspired by the history
of this particular square as it is an iconic Athenian square that used to be a very popular
meeting point for the people of Athens. Of late, however, a lot of people avoid crossing the
square due to fear of encountering homeless people and drug addicts. Games that we used
to play as children on the streets become the pivotal point to explore meetings in urban
areas and communication with strangers we inhabit the same space with but seldom
communicate joyously and fearlessly with.

</div>
<div>
<p>Αυτή τη χρονιά το θέμα του In Progress Feedback Festival είναι οι ' Αστικές Εκπλήξεις'.
Διαλέξαμε την πλατεία Ομονοίας για το project μας με σκοπό να δημιουργήσουμε μια
παράσταση που θα εξερευνά την ανάγκη μας για παιχνίδι και την αποδοχή της
διαφορετικότητας σε ένα πολυσύχναστοδημόσιο χώρο. Σκοπεύουμε να ανασύρουμε, να
θυμηθούμε και να παίξουμε τα παιχνίδια που συνηθίζαμε ως παιδιά. Εμπνευστήκαμε από
την ιστορία της συγκεκριμένης πλατείας, καθώς ήταν μια πλατεία των Αθηνών που
χρησιμοποιούνταν ως σημείο συνάντησης των κατοίκων της πόλης. Τα τελευταία χρόνια, πολύς κόσμος την αποφεύγει από φόβο συνάντησης με χρήστες ναρκωτικών ή
αστέγων. Παιχνίδια που συνηθίζαμε να παίζουμε ως παιδιά στους δρόμους γίνονται ο
κεντρικός άξονας από τον οποίο θα εξερευνήσουμε τις συναντήσεις στις αστικές περιοχές
και την επικοινωνία με αγνώστους με τους οποίους μοιραζόμαστε τον ίδιο χώρο αλλά
σπάνια επικοινωνούμε με χαρά και δίχως φόβο μαζί τους.

What We Need and What You Get:</b></p>
<p>“Concord” is a public art project that is NOT ticketed to help make it accessible to all. If you
decide to contribute, your money will go towards artists’ travel expenses, their fees,
production expenses like costumes, sets, music and documentation of the performance. In
case we do not reach our entire goal, we may not be able to afford to have such a diverse
group of collaborators. However, the project will still take place, though under a tight
budget. Your support is extremely valuable and encouraging for us as it is fantastic to be
able to realise a project for the community, supported by a community. To express our
heartfelt gratitude to you we promise to keep you updated on the progress of the project
and also send small surprises to your mailbox.
</p>
<p><b>Τι χρειαζόμαστε και τι μπορείτε να μας προσφέρετε:</b></p>
<p>Το 'Concord' παρόλο που θα είναι μια δημόσια παράσταση δεν θα έχει εισιτήριο έτσι ώστε
να δώσει τη δυνατότητα σε όποιον θελήσει να το παρακολουθήσει. Αν αποφασίσεις να
συνεισφέρεις, τα χρήματα σου θα χρησιμοποιηθούν στα έξοδα εισιτηρίων των καλλιτεχνών,
στις αμοιβές τους, σε έξοδα παραγωγής όπως σκηνικά, κουστούμια, μουσική και
βιντεοσκόπηση-φωτογράφηση της παράστασης. Σε περίπτωση που δεν καταφέρουμε να
φτάσουμε το χρηματικό στόχο τότε ενδεχόμενα να μην αλλάξει η σύσταση της ομάδας.
Όπως και να πάντως, το project θα πραγματοποιηθεί με ένα πιο σφιχτό budjet. Η
υποστήριξή σας είναι πολύτιμη και εξαιρετικά ενθαρρυντική για μας αφού είναι υπέροχο

<p>The aim of our public art project is to offer joy, love and hope in what are difficult times for
the world (especially Greece), fraught with problems of xenophobia, racism and economic
meltdown. If you contribute to the campaign, you will be contributing towards a
transformation through art, momentary though it may be, of a hostile urban environment.
Also, you will be helping us put together a performance that is not for a select few but
attempts to create a sense of community and connection for all passers by at this Grecian
city square.
</p>
<p><b>Ιmpact:</b></p>
<p>Ο στόχος του δημόσιου καλλιτεχνικού μας project είναι να προσφέρουμε χαρά, αγάπη
και ελπίδα σε δύσκολες εποχές σε παγκόσμιο επίπεδο, αλλά και στην Ελλάδα
συγκεκριμένα, γεμάτες ξενοφοβία, ρατσισμό και οικονομική κατάρρευση. Αν συνεισφέρεις
στην καμπάνια, θα συνεισφέρεις ως προς μια μεταμόρφωση μέσω της τέχνης, έστω και
προσωρινής, ενός εχθρικού αστικού τοπίου. Επίσης, θα βοηθήσεις ώστε να δημιουργηθεί μια
παράσταση που δεν θα είναι για λίγους αλλά που θα προσπαθήσει να δημιουργήσει μια

<p><b>Other ways you can help:</b></p>
<p>If the project interests you, but you are unable to contribute money, it does not mean you
cannot help. You could help us create some buzz about our campaign, get the word out on

<p>Αν σας ενδιαφέρει το project αλλά δεν μπορείτε να συνεισφέρετε, αυτό δεν σημαίνει ότι

performance, selected to be a part of the In Progress Feedback Festival (recognized by the
EFFE International Jury as one of Europe’s finest festivals) in Athens. “Concord” is an
international collaboration between Greek, Indian and Lithuanian artists, hosted and
coordinated by us, an Athens based theatre group called Simmoria tou iliou (Gang of the
Sun).

This physical theatre performance will take place at Omonia square (Omonia means ‘unity’ in Greek), a busy street in Athens where we will explore meetings in urban spaces, hoping to offer joy, love and hope in these conflict and despair ridden times.
 Even though In Progress Feedback Festival provides us with the fantastic opportunity to perform in public spaces in Athens, yet it is unable to provide any financial support. Our project, would not be possible without monetary aid as this is a free for all public art project, a non commercial venture. We seek your assistance to help us put together a performance that is not for a select few but attempts to create a joyous surprise and a sense of community for all passers by at the city square.

To “Πλας ντε λα Κονκόρντ - Plateia Omonoias -Concord” είναι μια site specific performance
σωματικού θεάτρου, η οποία επιλέχτηκε να παρουσιαστεί στα πλαίσια του In Progress
Feedback Festival (αναγνωρισμένο από τη Διεθνή Κριτική Επιτροπή EFFE ως ένα από τα
καλύτερα φεστιβάλ της Ευρώπης), στην Αθήνα. Πρόκειται για μια συνεργασία
καλλιτεχνών από Ελλάδα, Ινδία και Λιθουανία η οποία οργανώνεται και φιλοξενείται από
μια θεατρική ομάδα με έδρα την Αθήνα, τη Συμμορία του Ήλιου.
Αυτή η παράσταση σωματικού θεάτρου θα γίνει στην Πλατεία Ομονοίας όπου και θα
εξερευνήσει την έννοια των συναντήσεων στον αστικό χώρο, ελπίζοντας να προσφέρει
αγάπη και ελπίδα σε μια εποχή που τείνει να επικρατεί η σύγκρουση και η απελπισία.

Παρόλο που το In Progress Feedback Festival μας προσφέρει αυτή την φανταστική ευκαιρία
του να παίξουμε σε δημόσιους χώρους της Αθήνας δεν έχει τη δυνατότητα να μας
προσφέρει καμία οικονομική υποστήριξη. Το project μας δεν θα μπορέσει να
πραγματοποιηθεί χωρίς κάποια χρηματική συμβολή, καθώς πρόκειται για ένα καλλιτεχνικό
project που ελεύθερα μπορεί να το παρακολουθήσει κανείς. Ζητάμε λοιπόν τη βοήθειά
σας για να καταφέρουμε να συνθέσουμε αυτή την παράσταση που δεν θα είναι για λίγους,
αλλά θα επιχειρήσει να φέρει χαρά, έκπληξη και μια αίσθηση ενότητας σε όσους περνούν
από την πλατεία της πόλης.

of this particular square as it is an iconic Athenian square that used to be a very popular
meeting point for the people of Athens. Of late, however, a lot of people avoid crossing the
square due to fear of encountering homeless people and drug addicts. Games that we used
to play as children on the streets become the pivotal point to explore meetings in urban
areas and communication with strangers we inhabit the same space with but seldom
communicate joyously and fearlessly with.

Η ιδέα μας:


Αυτή τη χρονιά το θέμα του In Progress Feedback Festival είναι οι ' Αστικές Εκπλήξεις'.
Διαλέξαμε την πλατεία Ομονοίας για το project μας με σκοπό να δημιουργήσουμε μια
παράσταση που θα εξερευνά την ανάγκη μας για παιχνίδι και την αποδοχή της
διαφορετικότητας σε ένα πολυσύχναστοδημόσιο χώρο. Σκοπεύουμε να ανασύρουμε, να
θυμηθούμε και να παίξουμε τα παιχνίδια που συνηθίζαμε ως παιδιά. Εμπνευστήκαμε από
την ιστορία της συγκεκριμένης πλατείας, καθώς ήταν μια πλατεία των Αθηνών που
χρησιμοποιούνταν ως σημείο συνάντησης των κατοίκων της πόλης. Τα τελευταία χρόνια, πολύς κόσμος την αποφεύγει από φόβο συνάντησης με χρήστες ναρκωτικών ή
αστέγων. Παιχνίδια που συνηθίζαμε να παίζουμε ως παιδιά στους δρόμους γίνονται ο
κεντρικός άξονας από τον οποίο θα εξερευνήσουμε τις συναντήσεις στις αστικές περιοχές
και την επικοινωνία με αγνώστους με τους οποίους μοιραζόμαστε τον ίδιο χώρο αλλά
σπάνια επικοινωνούμε με χαρά και δίχως φόβο μαζί τους.






The traffic light turns red; 
a cacophony of rushing feet. 

We catch the corner of each other's eyes, 
we don't stop and greet.
Avoid physical contact carefully 
My crisp white shirt 







Mustn't get tarnished 
By your bohemian ideology. 
I haven't heard of the name 
Of the town you were born in. 
If only, I had asked you of the game
You played as a child, down your alley. 
Truth be told, we’re scared we might find 
That a smile can travel far,
And there is so much to unite us strangers 
Who on first glance, 
thought they were most unlike each other. 

~by Manjari Kaul, the codirector of Πλας ντε λα Κονκόρντ Plateia Omonoias Concord


Το φανάρι γίνεται κόκινο;
μια κακοφωνία απο βιαστικά πόδια .
Πιάνουμε ο ένας την ακρη του ματιού του άλλου,
δεν σταματάμε να χαιρετήσουμε.
Αποφεύγουμε την σωματική επαφή προσεκτικά
Το κάτασπρο πουκάμισό μου
Δεν πρέπει να λερώσει απο την μποέμ ιδεολογία σου
Δεν έχω ξανακούσει αυτό το όνομα
Της πόλης που έχεις γεννηθεί
Έτσι και σε είχα ρωτήσει για το παιχνίδι
που έπαιξες ως παιδί, στη γειτονιά σου.
Η αλήθεια να λέγεται, φοβόμαστε πως ίσως και να βρίσκαμε
πως ένα χαμόγελο μπορεί να ταξιδέψει πολύμακριά
και πως είναι τόσα πολλά αυτά που μας ενώνουν εμάς τους ξένους
που με την πρώτη ματιά
νομίσαμε πως ήμασταν τόσο διαφορετικοί.

~απο την Manjari Kaul, μια απο τις δυο σκηνοθέτες του Πλας ντε λα Κονκόρντ Plateia Omonoias Concord

The project is hosted and coordinated by Athens based theatre group Simmoria tou iliou,
established by Melina Skoufou in 2012. The play “Eviva!”,  is  the company's most recent success . Traveling together in the same train, two Greek women one of our own troubled  times and another one of the same age, having lived the tough times of the German occupation in Greece. They meet. A journey through their memories with fast motion, humor and emotion, which was performed for two years in a well known theater in Athens.
Το project οργανώνει και φιλοξενεί η ομάδα ""Συμμορία του Ήλιου"" που έχει έδρα την
Αθήνα και έχει ιδρυθεί το 2012 απο τη Μελίνα Σκούφου.  Το έργο ""Εβίβα!"" είναι η πιο πρόσφατη επιτυχία της ομάδας . Συνταξιδιώτισσες στο ίδιο βαγόνι,  ""συναντιούνται"" μία νεαρή κοπέλα της δικής μας ταραγμένης εποχής και μια  συνομήλική της, από τα δύσκολα χρόνια της γερμανικής κατοχής στην  Ελλάδα. Ένα ταξίδι ζωής στις αναμνήσεις των δύο  γυναικών με πολύ γρήγορους ρυθμούς, συγκίνηση και χιούμορ, που παρουσιάστηκε για δύο χρονιές σε γνωστό θέατρο της Αθήνας.

What We Need and What You Get:
“Concord” is a public art project that is NOT ticketed to help make it accessible to all. If you
decide to contribute, your money will go towards artists’ travel expenses, their fees,
production expenses like costumes, sets, music and documentation of the performance. In
case we do not reach our entire goal, we may not be able to afford to have such a diverse
group of collaborators. However, the project will still take place, though under a tight
budget. Your support is extremely valuable and encouraging for us as it is fantastic to be
able to realise a project for the community, supported by a community. To express our
heartfelt gratitude to you we promise to keep you updated on the progress of the project
and also send small surprises to your mailbox.

Τι χρειαζόμαστε και τι μπορείτε να μας προσφέρετε:
Το 'Concord' παρόλο που θα είναι μια δημόσια παράσταση δεν θα έχει εισιτήριο έτσι ώστε
να δώσει τη δυνατότητα σε όποιον θελήσει να το παρακολουθήσει. Αν αποφασίσεις να
συνεισφέρεις, τα χρήματα σου θα χρησιμοποιηθούν στα έξοδα εισιτηρίων των καλλιτεχνών,
στις αμοιβές τους, σε έξοδα παραγωγής όπως σκηνικά, κουστούμια, μουσική και
βιντεοσκόπηση-φωτογράφηση της παράστασης. Σε περίπτωση που δεν καταφέρουμε να
φτάσουμε το χρηματικό στόχο τότε ενδεχόμενα να μην αλλάξει η σύσταση της ομάδας.
Όπως και να πάντως, το project θα πραγματοποιηθεί με ένα πιο σφιχτό budjet. Η
υποστήριξή σας είναι πολύτιμη και εξαιρετικά ενθαρρυντική για μας αφού είναι υπέροχο








να δημιουργείς ένα project για την κοινότητα το οποίο υποστηρίζετε από την ίδια την
κοινότητα. Για να εκφράσουμε την απο καρδιάς ευγνωμοσύνη μας υποσχόμαστε να σας
κρατάμε ενήμερους για την πρόοδο του project καθώς και να σας στέλνουμε έξυπνες
εκπλήξεις στο mail σας.

Impact:
The aim of our public art project is to offer joy, love and hope in what are difficult times for
the world (especially Greece), fraught with problems of xenophobia, racism and economic
meltdown. If you contribute to the campaign, you will be contributing towards a
transformation through art, momentary though it may be, of a hostile urban environment.
Also, you will be helping us put together a performance that is not for a select few but
attempts to create a sense of community and connection for all passers by at this Grecian
city square.

Ιmpact:
Ο στόχος του δημόσιου καλλιτεχνικού μας project είναι να προσφέρουμε χαρά, αγάπη
και ελπίδα σε δύσκολες εποχές σε παγκόσμιο επίπεδο, αλλά και στην Ελλάδα
συγκεκριμένα, γεμάτες ξενοφοβία, ρατσισμό και οικονομική κατάρρευση. Αν συνεισφέρεις
στην καμπάνια, θα συνεισφέρεις ως προς μια μεταμόρφωση μέσω της τέχνης, έστω και
προσωρινής, ενός εχθρικού αστικού τοπίου. Επίσης, θα βοηθήσεις ώστε να δημιουργηθεί μια
παράσταση που δεν θα είναι για λίγους αλλά που θα προσπαθήσει να δημιουργήσει μια
αίσθηση κοινότητας και ενότητας για όλους τους περαστικούς αυτής της Ελληνικής
πλατείας.


Other ways you can help:
If the project interests you, but you are unable to contribute money, it does not mean you
cannot help. You could help us create some buzz about our campaign, get the word out on
social media. Do remember to use Indiegogo share tools if you are sharing information
about our campaign. And if you are Athens based, do come to watch our performance at
Omonia Square in April, 2016.

Άλλοι τρόποι που μπορείτε να βοηθήσετε:
Αν σας ενδιαφέρει το project αλλά δεν μπορείτε να συνεισφέρετε, αυτό δεν σημαίνει ότι
δεν μπορείτε να βοηθήσετε. Μπορείτε να μας βοηθήσετε να δημιουργήσουμε ντόρο
σχετικά με την καμπάνια μας, με το να ακουστεί στα social media. Θυμηθείτε να
χρησιμοποιήσετε τα εργαλεία του Indiegogo αν θέλετε να μοιραστείτε πληροφορίες σχετικά
με την καμπάνια μας. Αν ζείτε στην Αθήνα, ελάτε να δείτε την παράσταση μας στην
Ομόνοια, τον Απρίλη.

Nicky Diss & Thomas Judd set up Thick as Thieves last year. Our aim is to bring clear, accessible and entertaining Shakespeare to a broad audience.
It’s common to hear people saying they don’t enjoy Shakespeare because it’s boring or because it’s too difficult to understand. The thing is though, Shakespeare is neither of those things. It’s inherently entertaining, poetic, moving and hilarious. And it should be easy to follow!
Following our critically acclaimed and award-nominated The Tempest,
we are returning to The Hope Theatre with our gender-balanced production of Twelfth Night.
   How we work

We start with the first folio text, and make sure first and foremost that everything is clear - if the actors don’t understand what they’re saying, the audience definitely won’t.

All our productions have a cast of four actors, two male and two female. Whilst this is obviously a challenge, it adds to the fun of the production necessitating breakneck costume changes and clear characterisation.

We like to break down theatrical conventions and involve our audience. We’re always on stage (which includes changing costume), the audience is lit, we do the lighting and sound ourselves, we directly address the audience, and include elements of interaction and improvisation. We believe these are all things that make the audience as much a part of the production as the actors - and that’s what makes theatre so exciting, the fact that every performance is different and alive.

We are running this production under the Equity Fringe Minimum agreement which means that all our actors are being paid slightly over minimum wage for their work.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">After almost

the Artistic director of
#WeAlmostForgot, i
think this is indeed going to be a rare experience, not just for me alone nor
the entire creative
team,
but most especially for the audience. In this new creation, with 8 artistes on stage, all from varied
backgrounds and identities, we shall destroy assumptions and attempt to speak
about memories and the marks they leave on the body. Through the use of high energy movements, story telling, singing and music, I am hoping to create a show
whose beauty is mostly in its cathartic abilities to heal, to restore and to remember.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">#WeAlmostForgot will imagine the past as an
entity, that has returned to tell the present of its own horrors, of what we
must hear in order to make proper sense of it, rather than offering a
reconciliation or a realistic account, it has simply come on a cathartic mission, delivering our headlines in unforgettable personal stories.
Beyond history and memory, what else has the past got to offer the present? <br/></p>

(the date shall be communicated later). After almost 2 years of personal
 creative process, gathering the needed 
materials to create this work, then almost a year of 
sourcing for funds, reaching out to create possible partnerships, we have been able to raise up to 80% percent of our total budget, but we are
 still few miles away from raising the needed amount to conclude the creation, as at now, we are 20% away from the creation budget. Although
 with the help of the understanding team, work have started but at the 
end, we will need to financially cover up a lot of loop holes, here is 
why we need your BIG heart and GIVING spirit to make this happen. Your 
generosity through the funds raised in this campaign, will go towards 
production elements as we get to the end of our creation period, and plan a befitting world premier in Berlin. <br/></p>

<h3>Making of the team:<br/>
</h3>2 years ago, i decided to return to Lagos, after a decade of living in Paris, my career as a dancer/choreographer quickly became international, and quite successful with my previous works, but the need to shift base became paramount, mostly because i believe that if Africa is the future, as the empty slogan goes, then the future must be now, then i moved to Lagos and opened a dance center called The QDanceCenter, working mostly with young people and also traveling the continent.<br/><br/>In early 2015 i went to Gabon to do some teaching and mentoring, there i met Gaëlle, whom i thought i'd like to have in my team. Later same year i was invited by the British Council, Lagos, to create a piece with dancers with and without disabilities, and i produced IWA L'EWA with Debby as a major dancer in it, her presence struck me, regardless of her scoliosis, i knew she had to be a part of WAF. And Ese however had been in my previous work 'My Exile is in my Head"" since i knew I'll be needing an actress in this, i could think of no one but her. <br/><br/>Then in December 2015, we organized a 3days workshop/audition session in Paris, from there, i was drawn to the peculiar talents of Gwen, Sonia and Tidjiani, and one of the rarest creative team was made. We created a facebook group were we all interacted freely till we all met in Paris from January 18, 2016, to begin the process. It has been a physically and emotionally challenging work, but the bonding that existed was solid enough to be a motivation and a reason to want to go till the end of the journey. <br/><p></p>

How do we attain Grace within the muffling burden of memories? How do we remember when there are no words, when all we have are flashes of body memories? 


Artistic Intent- Qudus Onikeku:

After almost
two decades of performing, creating works and touring, and now as
the Artistic director of
#WeAlmostForgot, i
think this is indeed going to be a rare experience, not just for me alone nor
the entire creative
team,
but most especially for the audience. In this new creation, with 8 artistes on stage, all from varied
backgrounds and identities, we shall destroy assumptions and attempt to speak
about memories and the marks they leave on the body. Through the use of high energy movements, story telling, singing and music, I am hoping to create a show
whose beauty is mostly in its cathartic abilities to heal, to restore and to remember.
#WeAlmostForgot will imagine the past as an
entity, that has returned to tell the present of its own horrors, of what we
must hear in order to make proper sense of it, rather than offering a
reconciliation or a realistic account, it has simply come on a cathartic mission, delivering our headlines in unforgettable personal stories.
Beyond history and memory, what else has the past got to offer the present? 


We are looking to raise $15 000 before our premier in June 2016 
(the date shall be communicated later). After almost 2 years of personal
 creative process, gathering the needed 
materials to create this work, then almost a year of 
sourcing for funds, reaching out to create possible partnerships, we have been able to raise up to 80% percent of our total budget, but we are
 still few miles away from raising the needed amount to conclude the creation, as at now, we are 20% away from the creation budget. Although
 with the help of the understanding team, work have started but at the 
end, we will need to financially cover up a lot of loop holes, here is 
why we need your BIG heart and GIVING spirit to make this happen. Your 
generosity through the funds raised in this campaign, will go towards 
production elements as we get to the end of our creation period, and plan a befitting world premier in Berlin. 


Qudus
Onikeku is
the Artistic director and founder of YK Projects, Born in Lagos and a
graduate of The National Higher School of Circus Arts - France. For
more
than a decade, he has retained a presence in the Nigerian choreographic scene,
and part of the new generation creators springing up from Africa. Known in
Europe, Asia,
in the
USA, Latin America and the Caribbean for his solo works,
writings
and research projects. Choreographer of and also a dancer in the piece""


Making of the team:
2 years ago, i decided to return to Lagos, after a decade of living in Paris, my career as a dancer/choreographer quickly became international, and quite successful with my previous works, but the need to shift base became paramount, mostly because i believe that if Africa is the future, as the empty slogan goes, then the future must be now, then i moved to Lagos and opened a dance center called The QDanceCenter, working mostly with young people and also traveling the continent.In early 2015 i went to Gabon to do some teaching and mentoring, there i met Gaëlle, whom i thought i'd like to have in my team. Later same year i was invited by the British Council, Lagos, to create a piece with dancers with and without disabilities, and i produced IWA L'EWA with Debby as a major dancer in it, her presence struck me, regardless of her scoliosis, i knew she had to be a part of WAF. And Ese however had been in my previous work 'My Exile is in my Head"" since i knew I'll be needing an actress in this, i could think of no one but her. Then in December 2015, we organized a 3days workshop/audition session in Paris, from there, i was drawn to the peculiar talents of Gwen, Sonia and Tidjiani, and one of the rarest creative team was made. We created a facebook group were we all interacted freely till we all met in Paris from January 18, 2016, to begin the process. It has been a physically and emotionally challenging work, but the bonding that existed was solid enough to be a motivation and a reason to want to go till the end of the journey. 



Meet the team:

About me
My name is Sue Wylie and
I am a professional actress with over 30 years experience. I have appeared in
various sitcoms on tv, including The Two of Us and worked extensively in the theatre. Highlights include
writing and performing a one-woman show, In Search of Stardom, and
being part of the BBC radio rep. Kinetics is my latest play based on
my own true story.Five years ago I was
diagnosed with early onset Parkinson's.It was a shock. There was
a stigma attached in telling people.It wasn't very sexy.Parkinson's is a

it wasn't great news.I felt very alone.There are a lot of misconceptions
about the disease and people can be anxious about asking questions.I wanted to use the
medium of theatre to better inform people.

Then I met Laszlo...
16 years old, bright.Bored with school.Finding it difficult to
fit in.Parents back in Switzerland.His release was parkour
or free running… sometimes on the school roof.


About the play
Laszlo clearly needed
something to anchor him at school so we talked about writing a piece of drama. And
then it hit me, the idea for a play was right under my nose, an unlikely
friendship between two people seemingly at polar opposites:
Rose
-has Parkinson's and her world of movement is being slowly eroded
Lukas-
is young, headstrong and potentially set on course for disaster.
But they have more in
common than they think. 
And so Kinetics
was borne.                                      
The AimsKinetics has given me the opportunity to write something informative, humorous and
accessible to help provide insight and challenge some of the attitudes towards Parkinson's. The play also offers
a glimpse into the workings of the adolescent brain and an addiction to high
risk.
The play's objectives are to:
Look
     at the social and medical issues surrounding both characters.
Touch
     upon the fear of medication and the potentially profound side effects.
Raise
     awareness of Parkinson's and what it is like to live with the condition.
Highlight
     the sometimes difficult doctor-patient relationship.
Provide
     a platform for people to share their experiences and ask tough questions
     through the post show Q&A - these will be facilitated by medical experts.
Use
     humour to tackle some of the more challenging issues.
Attract
     a younger audience with sequences of live parkour.
Most important is that the play is dramatically entertaining in its own right regardless of
whether the audience have a connection with Parkinson's.

                  




What we have achieved 
Dorchester Arts have
taken on Kinetics as a co-commission and offered invaluable support, particularly
with publicity and marketing. This is an ongoing partnership. 
Kinetics is now under the umbrella of DT2productions a newly formed not-for-profit Charitable Incorporated Organisation.

</div></div>","Breve reseña
Revuelo es una
compañía de teatro peruana que hace teatro divertido, reflexivo y muy
creativo. Somos profesionales del teatro: dirigimos, actuamos, escribimos,  iluminamos, cantamos, bailamos, coreografiamos! Hemos organizado, producido, y
administrados uno y mil proyectos, desde un Solo en algún barcito, hasta un
auto sacramental en alguna catedral. Hemos fracasado y entonces aprendido;
hemos vencido y celebrado. Una y mil veces. Y es que ya no estamos tan chicos,
tenemos entre 30 y 40 años. 
“La humilde dinamita” es una obra de teatro que cuenta la historia de
Jonás, un chico reclutado por su propia hermana para ser parte de una columna
terrorista. La obra relata la transformación de Jonás, de su triste timidez
hacia una explosiva agresividad. Jonás camina por todas las etapas de la
guerra, vinculándose con diversos personajes: militares, civiles, políticos y seres metafísicos… La obra es una oportunidad para escuchar a cada uno de los personajes y comprender sus posturas, las razones que cada uno tuvo, para optar por la violencia. 
La historia es dramática pero no hemos podido huir del humor. Hemos creado un texto intenso aunque enfocado de forma lúdica (no somos fans del dramón). Además nos encanta mezclar lenguajes, así que teatro, video, danza, lucha y música, todo irá junto.
Lo que necesitamos y lo que obtienes

Necesitamos s/.42,000  o  $14,000 
Ese dinero es para cubrir todos los gastos que cuesta poner la obra en escena. Escenografía, Vestuario, Musicalización, Realización de video, Iluminación, Arte Gráfico, Traslados, Coreografía, Seguros, Sala de ensayos etc etc etc. 
Lo interesante de aportar en este proyecto, es que tu apoyo será milimétricamente sustentado ante Sunat (entidad que fiscaliza los tributos en Perú). LA HUMILDE DINAMITA se realiza bajo la razón social Asociación Teatro Veloz (asociación cultural sin fines de lucro en la que cada ingreso y egreso debe estar registrado). Y si algo sobrara (dificil pero posible), ese dinero debe reinvertirse en la Asociación.

<p><b><i>""Hero Worship</i></b><b>
is a must for every comic fan” – Theatre in Scotland</b></p>
<p>Hi everyone, I’m Kenny Boyle and last year I went on an
adventure. I decided to write a play. That in itself wasn’t really a big
milestone for me; I’ve written a few plays in my time. But this one was
different. This was a story I’d been waiting to tell ever since I first put pen
to paper (or fingers to keyboard) to write drama. I just hadn’t been brave
enough. And this time I wasn’t going to be content with doing a production of a
few days in one venue… I was going to take it on tour. Because when you make
something important you want as many people to see it as possible…</p>
<p>But I’m getting ahead of myself. You might know nothing
about me! It’d be rude of me to go on without some kind of introduction. So
here goes:</p>
<p>I’ve been producing plays since 2010, most notably the
return of Still Game to the stage in the Tron Theatre and the Ayr Gaiety.<br/>
Two of my plays “Forever” and “We Never Land” have been to
the Fringe before.<br/>
I’m a graduate of the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland and have the odd pleasure
of holding a master’s degree in acting. <br/>
And you can find out a whole heap more about me at kennyboyle.co.uk.</p>
<p><b>“Filled with pop
culture references, everyone is bound to find something they can relate to but
the piece is as easily digestible by those who can’t separate Superman from
Batman.” – The Public Reviews</b></p>
<p>So, back to our tale. Ultimately the play I wrote was called
Hero Worship, a play absolutely packed full of pop culture references about all
our favourite superheroes or heroines. If you don’t think you like theatre but
absolutely adore The Avengers, or Deadpool, or Batman then this play will have
you doing the whole emotional gamut from knowing smirks to outright
belly-laughing to sad nostalgia for simpler times spent reading comics and not
worrying about the world outside - rumbling away behind your bedroom curtain.
But it was more than that…</p>
<p><b>“Inhabits the inner
world of generation superhero with a creative passion and humanity that’s hard
to resist.” – The Scotsman</b></p>
<p>Generation Superhero… that’s us. This generation who are
devoted even more than any before us to men in tights and robot fights and the
fantastic fantasy world of the comic book. And why wouldn’t we be? Our
generation grew up full of hope that we would be able to achieve so much and
belief that if we worked hard we’d be able to accomplish the things our parents
did. In actual fact our poor fragile economy belly-flopped and left us all
hopelessly searching for a job and wondering why all the doors around us seemed
to suddenly be closing. </p>
<p>We’re a generation of underdogs who just wish we had
superpowers. Something to make us special. </p>
<p>And those are the perfect ingredients for our arch nemesia:</p>
<p>Anxiety. <br/>
Depression. <br/>
Hopelessness. </p>
<p>And that’s what Hero Worship is really about, recapturing
that spirit of belief in ourselves and the tenacity that we lost somewhere
along the way. It’s here to raise awareness of these mental health issues but
also to offer some insight into how we might manage them if we have them. </p>
<p>And the target market is young people from age 10 all the
way up to slightly less young people in their late twenties or, hey, early
thirties. </p>
<p>Because you’re never too young to be reminded that your
worth isn’t in a job title or salary, you’re so much more than that. You have a
super power, you’re incredible at something, and that’s what gives you worth. </p>
<p>And you’re never too old to be reminded of it either.</p>
<p><b>“This play was really
inspiring; it reminds you that there is a Superhero in everyone. “ – Eden Court
audience member, age 15</b></p>
<p>I took Hero Worship on tour around Scotland out of my own
pocket and it cleaned me out! But it was worth it. Particularly when it was
clear it had had an impact on people. </p>
<p>But there’s so much more good it can do. </p>
<p>And that’s where you come in. </p>
<p>Hero Worship has been offered a spot in C Venues for nine
days at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, which is a spectacular opportunity for
it to reach a huge and international audience. But the costs are much more than
I can manage to raise alone. </p>
<p>Your contribution could make the all the difference. At some
point mental health issues touch us all… even those we may sometimes think are
too young to suffer from them. </p>
<p>And this is just another step along the road of bringing
those issues out into the open and talking about them.</p>
<p><b>“Sometimes all we
need to <em>be</em> a hero is our empathy, and our
sensitivity to those who depend on us.” – The Outlier</b></p>
<p><b>What
We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>So, as you may or may not know, the
cost of bringing a show to the Fringe, even for a short run, is almost
ridiculously high. But this particular fund raising campaign is for two things </p>
<p>The first – the cost of the actual
venue itself. Performing in CNova for nine days will cost  £1300 and
of course without the venue hire cost the show, sadly, can’t go on. </p>
<p>The second – advertising. Obviously
there’s no point putting on a show if you don’t have flyers, posters or any
other kind of advertising. Particularly not during the fringe when there are
thousands of other shows competing for people’s attention. So for advertising
the aim is a  modest £300, which will allow for a reasonable amount of
flyers to be printed for distribution and also posters to be displayed in the venue
and its sister venues. The remaining £400 will go towards paying crew such as a sound and
lighting operator. <br/></p>
<p>Sadly, because of limitations and
restrictions put in place by the venue – I can’t offer tickets as perks! What I
can offer however are these:</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>A professionally printed copy of the
Fringe script for Hero Worship: perfect bound and glossy covered, this script
will look right at home on your book shelf. </p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>A professionally printed copy of the
extended script for Hero Worship: full of additional or extended scenes, poems
and commentary.</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>A professionally printed copy of the
ultimate script for Hero Worship: featuring the extended script and also “An
idiot’s guide to becoming a Super Villain” – a how to guide to villainy from
the writer of Hero Worship. </p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Every single backer will also receive
special thanks in the program for making Hero Worship a reality. </p>
<p>If the project doesn’t reach its
goal – then what ever I HAVE raised will go towards the cost of the show and I’ll
try my luck raising the funds by some other means. I’m determined so hopefully
life will find a way!</p>
<p>If the project surpasses its goal
any additional funds raised will be used for additional marketing, a street team and inclusion in the
Fringe brochure. </p>
<p><b>The
Impact</b></p>
<p>A big part of the play is about
having fun. It will (and has) entertain audiences whether they are massive
comic book geeks (like me) or have never picked up a comic in their life. It’s
a heartfelt and funny look into the massive pop culture phenomenon that is the
superhero genre. </p>
<p>But the impact, the payoff, is
reaching young adults or people in their twenties with the message that talking
about mental health problems like anxiety and depression is perfectly healthy
and normal and could very well help. My hope is that this play will start
discussions and banish some of the stigma that surrounds the idea of mental
health issues. If one young person in one audience comes forward and tells
someone that they’ve been suffering and been afraid to talk about it… well then
the play will have been well worth it, because that first step could change
that young person’s life. If it reaches even more, then even better. The impact
could be huge. I hope it is. But it can only happen with your contribution.</p>
<p>As a producer, I have a very strong track
record! My previous productions have received critical acclaim and the tour of
Hero Worship picked up a bag full of four and five star reviews all of which
you can read here: HeroWorshipPlay.com</p>
<p>As well as a great many audience
reviews from young audience members at all the venues which I place even more
value in as it shows the play reached the people it was meant to. Sometimes in
very moving ways. </p>
<p><b>“Still have this show replaying through my head. Both funny
and thoughtful” – message from Eden Court audience member a week after the
show. Age 14.</b></p>
<p><b>Risks
&amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>Of course, with any creative endeavor
there are risks. I may not raise the funds, which would most likely result in
the loss of a deposit of hundreds of pounds and the show not being seen at the
fringe. The advertising may not successfully draw in audiences. The show could
clash with other popular shows in nearby venues and audience numbers could be
harmed. At the Edinburgh Fringe there are hundreds of possible problems. </p>
<p>But I’m not new to this. As I said
two of my shows have been to the Fringe before and I’ve performed in the Fringe
for three years running. I have a good amount of knowledge in how to navigate many of the
festival’s common pit falls. The biggest hurdle to Hero Worship is raising this
initial £2000. Everything after that is just a matter of experience!</p>
<p><b>Other
Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>Some people just can't contribute
financially. I get that!<span>  But that
doesn't mean you can't help: please share this campaign. Get the word out! Not
only if you’d love to see a play about superheroes and how they have become a
massive part of our culture, but also if you’re passionate, as I am, about
spreading awareness about anxiety and depression and opening the dialogue that
might change a young person’s life.</span></p>
<p>And that's all there is to it!</p>

Less than 33% of plays produced in the USA and UK are directed by women. Less than 20% are written by women. Fewer than 10% are produced by women. Make a difference: join us in putting women's voices front and center on stage, and help us create paid opportunities for professional women in theater.
""Out of Our Father's House"" features the stories of seven American women, drawn from their letters, stories, and diaries. Supported by an all female crew and Director Marya Mazor, the actors bring to the stage stories and voices that have been lost for generations. Help us bring this production back to the stage in Los Angeles and Edinburgh.

What We Need & What You Get
Your support pays the cast and crew, and covers costs of four shows in Los Angeles and twenty-five in Edinburgh. In return for helping support a portion of the $60,000 needed to mount this production, you can receive:

Credit - at our highest levels, you will be recognized for creating opportunities for women and women's voices in theater, both in Los Angeles and the UK.
Exclusive Access - meet the crew, have drinks with cast, and dinner with the producers.
Memories - see the show live and take home a signed and personalized poster.


The Impact
The percentage of plays produced by women on Broadway has stayed at a meager 12% since its inception. The biggest qualification for women to be chosen as theater directors remains ""found your own company."" Without your support, this will not change. Join us in providing twelve paid positions for female theater professionals. Help us put the voices and stories of women on stage, front and center. With your support, we can make a difference.

Other Ways You Can Help
Get the word out. Connect donors and foundations. Bring this production to schools, colleges, and universities. Tweet us on twitter, tag/share on facebook, and follow us on snapchat and instagram #OOFH

<p>
</p><p><b>What Is Tieline Theater?</b></p><p>As alumni of the Quinnipiac University Theater department, there's a tradition we hold dear that's been upheld since its inception. After performing in their first mainstage show all newcomers receive a piece of tie line, presented to them by the veterans of the department.  This tie line is a symbol of inviting them wholeheartedly into the theater family called the ""D-Lites"" or ""Drama Lites"" (but we'll save the origin of that D-Lite-ful name for another time).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The piece of tie line has come to represent many things since the tradition started, and though its origins are somewhat blurred, the strongest image is one of unity and bonds. Much like how tie line holds together a theater set; students and alumni of the department are all held together and connected by their experience and the powerful work they've done, no matter where they are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have incorporated this idea of being connected into the very core of our performace. ""It's like you and your scene partner are attached by a million tiny strings, so everything each of you does directly influences the other."" (Timothy Cochran: Professor of Communication and Theater, Holyoke Community College) We want to connect with each other, with other students and performers from near and far, with the audience, and with the community as a whole. </p>
<p>And so, our goal is to raise awareness of the area's artistic potential.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This project is being used as the cornerstone for future endeavors; including full-length summer shows and workshops. We wish to bring theater to the community and enhance the local arts culture.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>Our campaign last year was able to bring in over $1,300! It helped us tremendously, but we were definitely down to the wire on a lot of things. We're confident we can do even better this year with your help and create an experience that'll leave an everlasting impression on our audiences to come! Here's what your donations will go toward supporting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Housing and food for tech week and performances</li>
<li>Posters, flyers, and other miscellaneous publicity</li>
<li>Transportation (gas and train fare)</li>
<li>Costumes and props</li>
<li>Future workshops and endeavors just like this!</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p><p>As a result, we'll be able to provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>An amazing tale of action, tragedy, and love!</li>
<li>Some very fun and unique rewards building off of what we offered last year including a private video link of the performance, behind the scenes footage, and more!</li>
<li>Further progress in laying a groundwork to provide this kind of experience for years to come!</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p><p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>The goal of Quinnipiac's theater department has always been ""Theater for Community,"" and having come from that very place, that's something we passionately believe in. But that community is both internal and external. By supporting us, you'll not only be strengthening the campus/alumni theater community and the theater community at large, but also extending the Quinnipiac/Hamden theater community beyond the confines of the school year in a location that's ripe for artistic endeavors. We genuinely feel that this project will leave a lasting impression with everyone involved and will not only challenge and bring the cast together, but strengthen the ties between the community and the art that can flourish within it. If theater hadn't been such an important part of our lives, we wouldn't be doing this. If we didn't think that doing great theater that engages the community was important and could enrich people's lives, we wouldn't be doing this. We want to give back to a school and community that's given us so much, but we need your help! And with it, we know we'll give people a unique and very entertaining experience while laying the groundwork for even greater things to come.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Other Ways You Can Help!</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you support our effort and can't contribute monetarily, never fear! Just spreading the word is an INCREDIBLE help. Tell your friends, your family, your co-workers… anyone! Even a little can go a long way, and we deeply appreciate any form of assistance you can provide.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Stay Tuned!</b></p>

What Is Tieline Theater?As alumni of the Quinnipiac University Theater department, there's a tradition we hold dear that's been upheld since its inception. After performing in their first mainstage show all newcomers receive a piece of tie line, presented to them by the veterans of the department.  This tie line is a symbol of inviting them wholeheartedly into the theater family called the ""D-Lites"" or ""Drama Lites"" (but we'll save the origin of that D-Lite-ful name for another time).

The piece of tie line has come to represent many things since the tradition started, and though its origins are somewhat blurred, the strongest image is one of unity and bonds. Much like how tie line holds together a theater set; students and alumni of the department are all held together and connected by their experience and the powerful work they've done, no matter where they are.

We have incorporated this idea of being connected into the very core of our performace. ""It's like you and your scene partner are attached by a million tiny strings, so everything each of you does directly influences the other."" (Timothy Cochran: Professor of Communication and Theater, Holyoke Community College) We want to connect with each other, with other students and performers from near and far, with the audience, and with the community as a whole. 
And so, our goal is to raise awareness of the area's artistic potential.

This project is being used as the cornerstone for future endeavors; including full-length summer shows and workshops. We wish to bring theater to the community and enhance the local arts culture.

What We Need & What You Get

Our campaign last year was able to bring in over $1,300! It helped us tremendously, but we were definitely down to the wire on a lot of things. We're confident we can do even better this year with your help and create an experience that'll leave an everlasting impression on our audiences to come! Here's what your donations will go toward supporting:

Housing and food for tech week and performances
Posters, flyers, and other miscellaneous publicity
Transportation (gas and train fare)
Costumes and props
Future workshops and endeavors just like this!


As a result, we'll be able to provide:

An amazing tale of action, tragedy, and love!
Some very fun and unique rewards building off of what we offered last year including a private video link of the performance, behind the scenes footage, and more!
Further progress in laying a groundwork to provide this kind of experience for years to come!


The Impact

The goal of Quinnipiac's theater department has always been ""Theater for Community,"" and having come from that very place, that's something we passionately believe in. But that community is both internal and external. By supporting us, you'll not only be strengthening the campus/alumni theater community and the theater community at large, but also extending the Quinnipiac/Hamden theater community beyond the confines of the school year in a location that's ripe for artistic endeavors. We genuinely feel that this project will leave a lasting impression with everyone involved and will not only challenge and bring the cast together, but strengthen the ties between the community and the art that can flourish within it. If theater hadn't been such an important part of our lives, we wouldn't be doing this. If we didn't think that doing great theater that engages the community was important and could enrich people's lives, we wouldn't be doing this. We want to give back to a school and community that's given us so much, but we need your help! And with it, we know we'll give people a unique and very entertaining experience while laying the groundwork for even greater things to come.

Other Ways You Can Help!

If you support our effort and can't contribute monetarily, never fear! Just spreading the word is an INCREDIBLE help. Tell your friends, your family, your co-workers… anyone! Even a little can go a long way, and we deeply appreciate any form of assistance you can provide.

Stay Tuned!

We'll have more exciting updates as we go along! Thanks for your support!In The Meantime:Check out the highlight reels of our past two shows!-Midsummer Lovers--Twelfth Night-",0.0,2,"5 Campaigns

<p>Cal Poly Pomona is where I was introduced to Moliere's work. It is also where I adopted the idea of writing a play in verse! I have been working on this play for six years. Writing a play in rhyming couplets is not easy! But, my dedication and admiration towards Moliere was well worth the hard work! My goal was to accomplish two things! Create a play that would impact an audience of today like Moliere's audience was impacted all the way back in the 1600's. His plays poked fun at hypocrisy, challenged authority, explored sexuality and questioned religion. That's exactly what this play does but in a present time kind of way. Moliere's plays shocked it's audience. And that is exactly what T.I.T.S. does! I am proud of this production and I am very excited for what this play can be!

<br/><i><b>Short Summary</b></i><br/>This play has been in the works for six years! The play started off on my quest to create a piece based on my Aunt Nine-- she pretty much embodies the Jones Family. A vulgar, emotional, outspoken, so honest it hurts, ready to kick some ass if you cross her family in any way kind of person! But beyond that craziness was a person with a big heart! But what was once a short twenty minute one act play in pros at Citrus College about a dysfunctional family and is now a full length Rhyming Couplets play about a lot more than just dysfunction, but is a play that'll force the audience to challenge the ideas that this world is based on and will also force audiences to laugh at it as well! <br/><br/>Here's a little something about our play. <br/><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F139172279&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F139172279&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F534871452_640.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <ul> <li>We need 2,500 to do this show justice. With hiring a good crew to light us, costume us, and a stage manager to lead us into a great production. Our goal is to put this show up in Hollywood. <br/>
</li> <li>Contributing to this campaign will allow you to be a part of an ongoing process that has taken six long years. We are offering shirts, tickets, and much more for your help. Just a twenty five dollar donation will do so much for us. So please help support struggling hungry artist. <br/>
</li> <li>If we reach our goal, we will be able to put up a week long run in a comfortable space in North Hollywood. We will be able to put up a professional show!</li>
<li>Our tech crew is the most important aspect of this show. With out a good tech crew, this show will not go smoothly. As my actors do this show for the love and passion of theater, the crew must get paid in order to run a professional show! With your donations, even small donations-- they'll add up to a wonderful budget to put on a kick ass show!  <br/>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <ul> <li>The best part of putting this production together is the amazing cast! Especially with the actors that have been here from the very start! These passionate actors will be arriving to rehearsal, filling up their tanks, eating easy mac, and hopefully afford a six pack of PBR after a long rehearsal-- they do this all for the love of theatre. But, after the show is done and we actually finish the run, they'll be paid for their hard work with ticket sale profits. But the show must go up first to get rewarded for their hard work.  <br/>
</li>
<li>This is a show that has started off at nothing. While most believe that putting up a professional show is impossible with out a huge production budget and large scale theatre group,.. this production will happen with your help. Your impact is crucial! <br/>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p> <ul> <li>This show has been through developmental hell in the past. I'd say it's due to my lack in trust in myself. While we've gone through many producers, finally I have decided to take this on myself. As my first produced professional staged show, I have ten trusting actors who are following me every step of the way. We have battled so many obstacles and are still here ready to put this show up! With a little help from the people around us-- our goal can come true! <br/>
</li> <li>As producer, I am going to have a one week run of two shows, with a full tech crew supporting the production, in an amazing theater space set up in a safe place. I intend on sharing the profits with all my actors, and I hope to give an audience an amazing show. With the success of this show, I also plan on putting up more productions! Thanks for all your help!</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p> <ul> <li>SHARE, SHARE, SHARE, SHARE, and TALK, TALK, TALK, AND TALK! Spread the word. Share our posts. Tell your best friends! <br/>

  What We Need & What You Get  We need 2,500 to do this show justice. With hiring a good crew to light us, costume us, and a stage manager to lead us into a great production. Our goal is to put this show up in Hollywood. 
 Contributing to this campaign will allow you to be a part of an ongoing process that has taken six long years. We are offering shirts, tickets, and much more for your help. Just a twenty five dollar donation will do so much for us. So please help support struggling hungry artist. 
 If we reach our goal, we will be able to put up a week long run in a comfortable space in North Hollywood. We will be able to put up a professional show!
Our tech crew is the most important aspect of this show. With out a good tech crew, this show will not go smoothly. As my actors do this show for the love and passion of theater, the crew must get paid in order to run a professional show! With your donations, even small donations-- they'll add up to a wonderful budget to put on a kick ass show!  
    The Impact  The best part of putting this production together is the amazing cast! Especially with the actors that have been here from the very start! These passionate actors will be arriving to rehearsal, filling up their tanks, eating easy mac, and hopefully afford a six pack of PBR after a long rehearsal-- they do this all for the love of theatre. But, after the show is done and we actually finish the run, they'll be paid for their hard work with ticket sale profits. But the show must go up first to get rewarded for their hard work.  

This is a show that has started off at nothing. While most believe that putting up a professional show is impossible with out a huge production budget and large scale theatre group,.. this production will happen with your help. Your impact is crucial! 
    Risks & Challenges    This show has been through developmental hell in the past. I'd say it's due to my lack in trust in myself. While we've gone through many producers, finally I have decided to take this on myself. As my first produced professional staged show, I have ten trusting actors who are following me every step of the way. We have battled so many obstacles and are still here ready to put this show up! With a little help from the people around us-- our goal can come true! 
 As producer, I am going to have a one week run of two shows, with a full tech crew supporting the production, in an amazing theater space set up in a safe place. I intend on sharing the profits with all my actors, and I hope to give an audience an amazing show. With the success of this show, I also plan on putting up more productions! Thanks for all your help!    Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:  SHARE, SHARE, SHARE, SHARE, and TALK, TALK, TALK, AND TALK!

I, Tristan J. Shuler, supported by my high school classmates and teachers, was luckily able to produce this as a 25minute play just before graduating high school at the annual New Play Festival. This festival was 100% produced, designed, written, directed, and acted by STUDENTS. Yes, students. Now, years later, the play has developed over the course of time, yet maintained almost every element it had when it was created in that playwrighting class.</p>
<p>Emerging Artists Theatre in NYC has chosen <i>An Epidemic Play </i>to be a part of its New Works Series, in which the play is workshopped and produced for a one night performance in an Off-Broadway theater.</p>
<p>I wrote this play when I was 16 years old. I was in the peak of my senior year of high school angst, and though I didn't know it at the time, a pretty intense year of depression. The day <i>An Epidemic Play</i> performed for the first time in its 25minute form, it was clear that I finally felt 100% expressed and hopeful and optimistic. It was like I was a new person, burden lifted. When I moved to NYC at age 17, I knew that the play was special and meant so much to me, but had no idea that it could possibly go further and this story could be heard by many more people.</p>
<p>Donations towards <i>An Epidemic Play</i> will benefit the ENTIRETY of the production. All actors, designers, and directors are working on the show for free, and its funding proves necessary.

<h3 style=""text-align: right;"">About Audacity</h3>
<p><i>Audacity Theatre Company</i> is a brand-new organisation set up by Patrick Tolan. The company is dedicated to bringing about social change through theatre that tells stories from overlooked or ignored voices in society.</p>
<p>Back in 2013 I helped co-found <i>New Mutiny Theatre Company</i>, run by passionate practising professionals to create thought-provoking and exhilarating classical theatre experiences for family audiences.</p>
<p>In the past year <i>Audacity</i> has collected over 40 hours of interviews from around the country. From betting shops to boardrooms, from Westminster to the high street: the whole range of relevant views and opinions has been sought. That wealth of material has then been painstakingly edited into scenes and sequences forming a logical, emotionally engaging story arc and then precisely transcribed into a ninety-minute script.</p>
<p>I launched <i>Audacity</i> this year having worked as an actor for three years and appearing in <i>London Road </i>on its second ever run at the <i>Bristol Old Vic, </i>then in the consequent film in 2015. My imagination was caught by the verbatim style and how it could be crafted into something spectacular when combined with other forms.</p>
<p>In December 2016, <i>Audacity</i> held its first research and development. Five directors attended including: Hal Chambers <i>(Tucked In)</i>, Andrew Whyment <i>(Squint)</i>, Anna Simpson <i>(Quintessence)</i>, Chloe Mashiter <i>(Headlong)</i> and Sinead O'Callaghan. This spurred the project forward onto a more polished draft which is now ripe and ready for development.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: right;"">The Team</h3>
<p><strong>Hal Chambers</strong> - Director - Most recently he has directed work for Les Enfant Terribles, Eastern Angles, Company of Angles, York Theatre Royal, Seabright Productions, Soho Theatre, Polka Theatre, RBL Theatre Company, and Greenwich Theatre.</p>
<p><strong>Gareth Taylor</strong> - Choreographer - is a creative associate at <i>Curious Directive </i>who produce innovative work that explores life through the findings of science.</p>
<p><strong>Jim Hustwit</strong> - Composer -composer, producer and songwriter, scoring for theatre, television and film. He received the Peoples Music Award in 2010.</p>
<p><strong>Max Johns</strong> - Designer - is a recipient of a BBC Performing Arts Fellowship in 2015. Recent work includes productions at Bristol Old Vic and West Yorkshire Playhouse.</p>
<p><strong>Jo Walker</strong> - Sound Designer- is a multi-instrumentalist and specialises in devised work. His recent works include: <em>Erik Satie - Faction</em> by Alistair McGowan, and <em>Pioneer</em> by curious directive.</p>
<p>Actors are currently being approached to make up the cast.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: right;"">The Impact</h3>
<p>This piece is an urgent and crucial examination of gambling culture in the UK. Addiction as an issue is gaining more and more spotlight in the public discourse -as it should- but too often the focus is solely on subtance abuse and alcoholism. Behavioural addictions are often ignored or belittled as deserving of less support. Gambling is so normalised in our society that any discussion of protecting vulnerable people from its pitfalls go largely unheard against the cacophony of advertising and promotion, as bookies chase huge profits.</p>
<p><i>Crack Cocaine </i>doesn't do a wash on this issue. The CEO of the Association of British Bookmakers, the ex-chairman of Paddy Power, and a pro-gambling MP all feature in the play and offer their arguments for the status-quo. The result, when put against the stories of gamblers, shop staff, and gambler's families, is an honest and important debate.</p>
<p>This piece also presents a fresh and inspiring take on addiction that could genuinely help people struggling with addiction in their lives.</p>
<p>What we have a the moment is a full-length verbatim script which makes for a fascinating staged documentary. But in order to have the biggest impact this <i>must </i>be developed into an exhilerating and enthralling theatrical experience for paying audiences. This is why we are bringing together music, set and sound design, and choreography to create a unique and compelling storytelling style to complement the existing material.</p>

<p><i>Kunstler</i>, a two-person play by Jeffrey Sweet, is a portrait of the famous radical attorney, William  Kunstler, rebellious to the last as he appears as part of a guest speaker program at a law school, very aware that the young black woman introducing him isn’t thrilled with the assignment.  As he tells the dramatic stories of his key battles during the Sixties, he also finds himself defending his kind of law to this smart, critical young woman who views him as a dinosaur. </p>
<p>One of the leading figures of the Chicago theatre movement, Jeffrey Sweet's plays have picked up awards from the American Theatre Critics Association as well as the Jeff Award, a Best Plays citation, and critic's choices from the NY TIMES, THE LA TIMES and THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE.  Actors who have played in his writing include Amy Morton, Alan Bates, Jon Cryer, Jill Eikenberry, Reed Birney and Jack Klugman (who appeared in THE VALUE OF NAMES in six theatres). <br/> </p>
<p><i>Kunstler </i>was written specifically for Broadway veteran Jeff McCarthy (who received terrific reviews last season as one of the leads in <i>Southern Comfort</i> at the Public Theater and was one of the original stars of the Tony-winning <i>Urinetown</i>).  Jeff is joined by Nambi E. Kelley, a leading Chicago actor-writer (she recently received raves both as the star of the Goodman’s production of <i>Two Trains Running</i> and for her hit adaptation of Richard Wright’s <i>Native Son</i>).</p>
<p>The director is Meagen Fay, one of the most highly-regarded alums of Chicago’s famed Second City troupe and a guest star on almost every TV show worth your time (including <i>Mad Men </i>and <i>Transparent</i>).  Kunstler was a family friend (she called him “Uncle Bill”) who collaborated with her lawyer uncle on some of his most controversial cases.  (In fact, Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin crashed in the family house during the Chicago 7 trial and she had waffles with them in the morning.)</p>

<p>The Creative Place International,Inc. is a Small Professional Equity Theatre based in Saratoga Springs, New York and resident at the National Museum of Dance. The Creative Place is dedicated to developing family audiences, producing new work, and participating in international cultural exchange.  For over 30 years, New York City based ANDTheatre Company (Artistic New Directions) through its development program has provided a place for playwrights to create work through their choice of readings, workshops and improvisational exploration and has provided initial development support for Kunstler.</p>
<p><i>Kunstler</i> has been presented twice before, once in Regional Theatre (Hudson Stage), where it was praised by the <i>New York Times</i> as “skillful, wise and revealing,” then as part of the New York Fringe, where <i>Time Out</i> dubbed it a “critic’s choice.”  (Among its fans were Mike Nichols, Sheldon Harnick, Marshall W. Mason and Tonya Pinkins, who shlepped up the stairs to a garret to see it.)  This production will continue Kunstler’s journey from Regional Theatre to Fringe Festival, Off Broadway and beyond, bringing this “gripping” (<i>New York Theatre Review</i>) work to a wider audience and launching it into the national repertoire so the true story of a remarkable and complex man can be shared around the country and the world!  </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The World Crime League is a new Minneapolis-based theatre company devoted to staging new works with a bit of an edge. We got our start in the 2016 Minnesota Fringe Festival with Andrew Rosdail's premiere play, <i>Writer's Block.</i> We love theatre with dark comedic vibe and a hint of the macabre. More importantly, we want to provide a platform for up-and-coming artists to express themselves and flex their creative muscles.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We're not looking to make a killing on this endeavor. Producing quality theatre is expensive. It costs money to rent and use the space, build our sets, and pay the many wonderful actors and technicians who are devoting their time and energy to this project. We need all the support we can get to bring these terrifying pieces to life.</p>
<p>The Phoenix Theater cost us $1250.00 to rent out for the week. Additionally, we will be putting money into the set, lighting design, sound design, and stipends for the artists. The more you contribute, the more resources we'll have to devote to bringing you great theatre. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>You have the opportunity to support local theatre. As any member of the theatre community will tell you, we're not in it for the money. We're in it for the artistic fulfillment.</p>
<p>There is a great need in the Minneapolis Theatre Community: The need for theatre with an element of horror. We're hoping to scare the pants off of our audience members.</p>
<p>While we're a young company, we have had success in theatrical productions before. Andrew Rosdail wrote, directed, and produced his original play <i>Writer's Block</i> in the 2016 Minnesota Fringe Festival, and the production was a huge success. Additionally, Andy Rakerd and Geoff Conklin worked together in the 2015 Minnesota Fringe Festival to bring the world premiere of <i>Love and Persuasion </i> to the stage, and they were awarded an encore performance on the last day of the festival at the Rarig Xperimental Theatre. This is our first foray outside of the Fringe Festival, but with your help, we believe we can establish ourselves as a force to be reckoned with in the theatre community.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The World Crime League is a team of young working professionals endeavoring to make great theatre with limited funds. We're hoping to use lights, sound, limited sets, and a little blood to bring these stories to life. We have the vision and the know-how, but we don't have the benefit of a big theatre company backing us up. With your help, we hope we can bring a professional-quality production to the stage!</p>

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>Cyclamen Theatre is a group of theatre/performance-makers from Dublin, including director Sionnán Ní Nualláin and writer James Ireland. We are raising funds to tour our new work <i>The Elephant </i>to Fringe Arts Bath.</p>
<p>In July last year our friend Christy passed away.</p>
<p><i>THE ELEPHANT</i> is a maze-like immersive theatrical experience with every performance different. It’s our story of Christy, of Gods, and of blind men trying to describe an elephant.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We are seeking €500 to fund our tour to Fringe Arts Bath, for a four-night performance run and then an extended visual arts exhibition until June 11th.</p>
<p>This will fund (or in the event of us not reaching our goal, part-fund) the following:</p>
<p>Festival registration fee and venue costs<br/>Travel for two crew members and one actor for the duration of the performance run<br/>Accommodation for two crew members and one actor for the duration of the performance run<br/>Set and costume design &amp; transportation</p>
<p>To thank you for your faith in us we’ve compiled a few little thank yous you can check out on the side tab if you should decide to fund us. One part of the project we’ve been very excited about is the unconventional script James has written, which includes original artwork we’ve been able to use to inform our performance decisions. So you’ve an opportunity to hold a little piece of the script we’ve been working with these past months in your hand if you should choose to donate.</p>
<p>We are also holding fundraisers in Dublin to help us reach our goal that you are more than welcome to attend – such as our spoken word poetry night on May the 19<sup>th</sup> at Players Theatre, which will also include a rehearsed reading of <i>The Elephant</i> – your first chance to see our work even before audiences in Bath!<br/> </p>
<p><strong>Why this piece, and why now?</strong></p>
<p>We feel that art needs new forms. <i>The Elephant </i>isn’t a conventional theatre or performance piece – it includes audience interaction where the audience decides not only how moments in the performance will go, but which parts of the puzzle in Christy’s life they will get to witness.</p>
<p>Storytelling in theatre is no longer enough: we want to break down the barriers and create a full expanse of experience. The things that are happening in the world are really happening and we can no longer disengage as humans. Art must begin to reflect that, we can no longer stare passively at a pretty story onstage. This felt to us like the truest way of trying to present what happened: something we felt the more we’ve tried to work on the less we actually understand.</p>
<p>As we continue to develop our piece through production in Fringe Arts Bath and hopefully beyond, we wish to give the audience something they can't escape taking home.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>About the company</strong></p>
<p>Cyclamen Theatre was set up in Dublin in 2013, and has successfully produced three full-scale theatre shows in Dublin (<i>Mercury</i>, New Theatre 2016; <i>Fireplay, </i>New Theatre 2015; <i>The Dispersal of Wildflowers, </i>White Lady Art as part of 10 Days in Dublin 2013). Our collective members have also produced work for theatre and exhibition spaces across Dublin and the UK (including Space Venues @ Edinburgh Fringe; Pleasance Theatre Edinburgh and Islington; Samuel Beckett Theatre Dublin; Smock Alley Theatre Scene &amp; Heard and Collaborations festivals; Bram Stoker Festival Dublin; The Players Theatre and its curated festivals Shakespeare Festival, MythFest, and Celtic Twilight; The Lab on Foley Street; NCAD Graduate Exhibition).</p>

<p>All-Femme St. Joan Cast. 2017.</p>
<h3><strong>We’re About It</strong></h3>
<p>We are a collective of Chicago theatre makers committed to woke, dope art whose mission is to combine quality theatrical work with social justice. Our inaugural show is an all-femme production of St. Joan – where we examine the ways privileged women in power oppress other women via a text structured around men oppressing a woman.</p>
<p>We are raising money to cover the expenses of producing a play in Chicago, which includes paying for artist fees, production budgets, show rights, rehearsal and performance space, etc. Producing a show is expensive, so every single contribution, large or small, is much appreciated!</p>
<p>With your help, this play will reach hundreds of audience members who will be able to consider and discuss this new imagining of St. Joan. With an inclusive cast of 17 femme-identifying artists, we will be able to engage our artists and our audiences in a broader conversation about the ways in which ALL women can be supporting each other. We hope to eventually tour this show nationally and internationally to bring a femme-powered, multi colored cast to as many people as possible, and you can be a part of launching that journey!  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Hook Up</h3>
<p>We want to raise $8,000 to cover the following fees</p>
<ul>
<li>Rehearsal and performance space </li>
<li>Production costs (set/props, costumes, marketing, show rights, etc.)</li>
<li>Cast &amp; creative team.</li>
</ul>
<p>In return for your generosity, the perks you could get include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A personalized ""Thank You"" email</li>
<li>A dope sticker</li>
<li>A program signed by the cast &amp; creative team</li>
<li>An invitation to the final dress</li>
<li>Two (2) free tickets to a select performance of the show </li>

<h3>Y'all Ready?</h3>
<p>This production reflects the reality in which we are living, where feminism and women’s rights movements blatantly overlook women of different gender identities, sexual identities, colors, and sizes. We forget, or choose to ignore, the lack of intersectionality and inclusivity when it comes to the human rights <i>all </i>femme-identifying persons deserve. In one way, this production is a reminder that only through advocating for the voices of all women can we achieve true equality. In another way, it is a celebration, a thrilling theatrical adaptation featuring a team of artists whose inclusivity and dedication mirrors the backbone of Chicago’s theatre. </p>
<p>One of our goals as a team is bringing in audiences and backers of all backgrounds in order to cultivate conversations around this play that explore questions of feminism, intersectionality and everything in between. </p>
<p>We are committed to social justice through theatre, and your contribution will help!</p>
<h3>Rise Up</h3>
<p>This is the kind of theatre we want EVERYONE to have the opportunity to see. The inclusivity of our cast will mean little if it is not reflected back from our audiences and our community . A risk within theatre for social justice is often forgetting and/or excluding the communities we try to elevate onstage. We challenge ourselves to navigate this risk through inclusive marketing, an open invitation for dialogue on our social media, and the guarantee that no ticket will cost more than $15. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Hustle is Real</h3>
<p>We know $8,000 is A LOT of money. If you can't donate - no worries! Here are other ways you can help spread the word about us and make all-femme St. Joan a success</p>

This production reflects the reality in which we are living, where feminism and women’s rights movements blatantly overlook women of different gender identities, sexual identities, colors, and sizes. We forget, or choose to ignore, the lack of intersectionality and inclusivity when it comes to the human rights all femme-identifying persons deserve. In one way, this production is a reminder that only through advocating for the voices of all women can we achieve true equality. In another way, it is a celebration, a thrilling theatrical adaptation featuring a team of artists whose inclusivity and dedication mirrors the backbone of Chicago’s theatre. 
One of our goals as a team is bringing in audiences and backers of all backgrounds in order to cultivate conversations around this play that explore questions of feminism, intersectionality and everything in between. 
We are committed to social justice through theatre, and your contribution will help!
Rise Up
This is the kind of theatre we want EVERYONE to have the opportunity to see. The inclusivity of our cast will mean little if it is not reflected back from our audiences and our community . A risk within theatre for social justice is often forgetting and/or excluding the communities we try to elevate onstage. We challenge ourselves to navigate this risk through inclusive marketing, an open invitation for dialogue on our social media, and the guarantee that no ticket will cost more than $15. 

The Hustle is Real
We know $8,000 is A LOT of money. If you can't donate - no worries! Here are other ways you can help spread the word about us and make all-femme St. Joan a success

<p>Part of the magic of Oscar Wilde is derived from the fact that his renowned, Gothic masterpiece, <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> has been interpreted and staged in many ways. But here, the creators of <i>“THE EXTRA-ORDINARY CABARET OF DORIAN GRAY”</i>  have done something decadently different. <i>""Dorian Gray"" </i>as you've never seen before. When we say ‘creators’, we are not just talking about writer Linnie Reedman and composer Joe Evans, but the entire cast. This has been a truly collaborative process so far, and continues to be so, as we all club together to take up a wonderful invitation to be part of this year’s Edinburgh Festival. The commitment and enthusiasm of the cast and creative team have been inspiring. And we want the process to continue.</p>
<p>Still reeling from the reception received from the performance at the Spiegeltent (where audience reaction includes phrases such as <i>“hauntingly sexy”</i>, and <i>“insanely beautiful”</i>) we are now in preparation for the run at the Leith Volcano – a beautiful but derelict gothic church in the heart of Leith, Edinburgh – the perfect setting for the show.</p>
<p>However, this is not a cheap enterprise. We at Ruby In The Dust, a nonprofit company, are counting on a successful campaign to raise money to fund the production.  Whilst the cast and creative team are all mucking in to make this work, there are still essentials that cannot be avoided before we even start on that journey.</p>
<p>Specifically transport and accommodation, which comprises over half of the budget for the show’s run in Edinburgh. Your help in meeting these costs will ensure the company are able to make this transfer to Edinburgh a reality. Just to reach our destination, put a roof over our cast's head and secure the venue we need £3,000 now. That is the ultimate goal - but any pledge to get us going will be in valuable - however small or large. The perks listed to the right are merely guidelines. Any amount is okay. Anything goes!</p>
<p>Written and directed by Linnie Reedman, the story is set in a fantasy, steampunk world, and stitched together by the narration of the sinister character of Mr Isaacs, a theatre manager who is out to get revenge on Dorian for the ""murder"" of his protegé Sybil Vane. The tale unfolds in a series of cabaret sketches with original music by Joe Evans, with choreography by Penelope Simons, and innovative design by Belle Mundi.</p>
<p>Riculously talented Rada graduate, Kit Young, takes on the role of the exotic Dorian Gray, alongside tragic love interest Sibyl Vane, played by Hero Douglas - directly related to Lord Alfred Douglas, the friend and lover of Oscar Wilde, whose father, the Marquess of Queensbury, brought about Wilde’s arrest and subsequent sentence to two years hard labour at Reading Gaol. Meanwhile Lord Alfred (who coined the phrase “the love that dare not speak its name” – often falsely attributed to Wilde) was forced into exile. The multi-talented cast also includes Lewis Rae, Joe Cushley, Christine Holman, Jo Ashe and Sophie Judd.</p>
<p>Ruby in the Dust was formed by director/writer Linnie Reedman and composer/musician/writer/ Joe Evans. Together, they’ve brought over a dozen productions to the stage that run the gamut from the fringe to the West End. They’ve proven their skill at integrating original and interpolated music into the text. Of Bonnie and Clyde, The Times critic wrote that it conjured a <i>“powerful visual and musical atmosphere.”</i>  They’ve won raves for their musical shows and because the stamp of authenticity that they place on every production is simultaneously true to its roots and boldly original, they’ve also been able to use music that already claims a steadfast audience and introduce it to new ones.  They received the blessing of the Cole Porter Estate to use several Porter compositions for their production of Hutch in 2013. But they are mainly noted for incorporating original music into their productions. Their adaptation of the F. Scott Fitzgerald classic, ""<i>The Great Gatsby""</i>  has enjoyed three runs to date, and been developed with Royal Shakespeare Company’s director Adrian Noble. The Telegraph said of the production <i> </i>that it <i>“grips throughout.”  </i></p>
<p>This adaptation of <i>Dorian Gray </i>began its life as a one night gala presentation in London’s Café Royal. Just before it closed its doors for its major refurbishment, the venue was transformed to its heyday glory by taking the story back to its birthplace: staging the show, on Oscar Wilde’s birthday, in the beautiful Domino Room - which was where Wilde would hold initial readings of his works, and dine with his lovers. </p>

<h3>Third Friday Durham Dance Series</h3>
<p>My name is Myra Weise and I am the founder / director of Proxemic Media, a new arts administrative consulting and producing company. With the modern dance scene proliferating in downtown Durham, and Third Fridays Durham so far only including arts galleries, studios and buskers throughout the city, we thought now was the perfect time to add a dance series to the vibrant scene. </p>
<p>Third Friday Durham Dance Series will take place this August through November. Each third Friday will feature two choreographers / companies with repeat performances at 8:30pm and 9:30pm. Performances will be free to the public with the success of a crowdsourcing campaign! </p>
<p>Funds will help support regional artists, help keep performances free to the public, and will aid in the cost of technical details and marketing efforts. Supporters will also be contributing to the vibrant cultural atmosphere in downtown Durham that the city has become known for in recent years. We hope you will join us! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are seeking to raise $3000 in 30 days to help make this dream of a dance series a reality. </p>
<p>Two-thirds of the funding will go towards paying regional artists. (Two companies per third Friday; four Fridays in the series. Each  Friday will contain different companies.)</p>
<p>One-third of the amount raised will subsidize performances so that they are free to the public, and will also contribute to the cost of technical details and marketing efforts. </p>
<p>We couldn't do this without you! As a small token of thanks, here are some perks you'll receive with your donation: </p>
<p>$10 - our undying gratitude &amp; a shout out to the wide world via Facebook</p>
<p>$25 - the above + a handwritten postcard of an artistic image from one of the performances</p>
<p>$50 - the above + a darling Proxemic Media t-shirt... art. get closer to it. </p>
<p>$150 - the above + a home cooked meal and chats on the state of the arts with Proxemic Media's founder/director Myra Weise </p>
<p>No matter how much we raise - every penny will go towards making this dance series happen. With Weise's arts administrative experience spanning a decade, this new series is sure to manifest an incredible new outlet for regional choreographers/companies to have their work shown. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Not able to contribute financially but would still love to help out?! We value your presence as an audience member! Please come by one of the third Fridays, August through November, to check out one of the performances (repeat performances each month at 8:30pm and 9:30pm). </p>
<p>Want to contribute by volunteering? We'll need a few volunteers each month to assist with greeting folks and perhaps even pouring sips of wine or water for audience members. </p>
<p>You can also help by spreading the word! Thanks to incredible organizations like American Dance Festival, Duke Performances and Durham Independent Dance Artists, the dance scene is proliferating exponentially each year.  Proxemic Media is thrilled to bring dance to the vibrant Third Fridays Durham! Tell your friends and family - it will be another event on the quintessential Durham bucket list! </p>

The show aims to engender an awareness of how we are all intimately and profoundly connected.  My aim is to bring more light and love to the human condition.”  - David GeddesThough this philosophy may appear deep and heavy the show is actually quite light hearted and life affirming and is teeming with existential playfulness and ""woo woo"".Thankyou so much for reading this far, and thank you in advance for your support.With Love and Light, David  Geddes and Gail Fay",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>About the Show:</h3>
<p>The final piece of the Kennedy Center Award-winning play series The Suicidal Comedies,  <i><strong>Cracks</strong></i> follows a gifted young biochemist named Nicole who is trying to unboil an egg.  When she meets Kat, a tech developer trying to stop Global Warming, romance sparks between the two women. But first, Nicole must confront the explosive ending of her last relationship, with the help of a giant egg named Humpty Dumpty.</p>
<p><strong><i>Cracks</i></strong> explores the ways in which mental illness shapes not only our own lives, but the lives of those around us. It is funny, insightful, and immensely powerful, and we can't wait to share it with you.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>About the Company:</h3>
<p>The team behind the Kennedy Center Award-winning The Suicidal Comedies is thrilled to announce that the final play in the series, Cracks, will make its debut at this year’s FringeNYC.</p>
<p>As a series, The Suicidal Comedies won the Jean Kennedy Smith Playwriting Award from the Kennedy Center.  The first two plays in the series have been produced across the country, but both started at FringeNYC, where <i>Chemistry</i> won FringeNYC’s Excellence in Playwriting Award, and Coping won FringeNYC’s Excellence in Acting Award and was voted a FringeFAVE.</p>
<p>Other FringeNYC shows that members of our team have worked on include <i>Recipe for Success </i>with Chef Michael Denardi, <i>I Was Loved by a Rat</i>, Portrait and a Dream, and <i>Meet Murasaki Shikibu.</i></p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We've Done So Far:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Applied and been accepted into FringeNYC 2018</li>
<li>Assembled an incredibly talented cast</li>
<li>Created our rehearsal schedule</li>
<li>Designed our beautiful set</li>
<li>Created a kick-ass logo</li>
<li>Launched our Social Media Campaign</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Still Need: </h3>
<p>As much as we are trying to keep our production on a limited budget, our actors and production team spend endless time and energy to create meaningful, poignant work. Everyone deserves to be compensated for their time, not just in gratitude and applause (Although we love both)!  And there are lots of other expenses that go into bringing a show to life. Here are some of the costs we need your help to cover:</p>
<p>Stipend for one actor: $300</p>
<p>Stipends for our Producer, Writer, Director, Marketing and Press Director, Lighting Designer, Composer, Set Designer, Costume Designer, Stage Manager, Graphic Designer, and Photographer: $1300</p>
<p>15 dozen hard boiled eggs (come see the show to find out what they’re for!): $100</p>
<p>Rehearsal Space: $800</p>
<p>U-Haul rental to transport our set: $250</p>
<p>Insurance to cover our actors during rehearsal and performance: $100</p>
<p>Press Mailing services, so we can share our story with reviewers, press agents, and industry folks: $150</p>
<p>Costumes, Set, and Flame-Proofing: $950</p>
<p>Digital Advertising: $200</p>
<p>While some of the funding will be raised via ticket sales, we are hoping to raise $8,500 to cover the difference.</p>
<p>REMEMBER, NO DONATION IS TOO SMALL. Even $1 buys us half a dozen eggs!</p>

<p>A ticket to see us at FringeNYC is $22. Consider donating the cost of a ticket to the campaign.</p>
<p>If you cannot come see the show or support us financially, but you would still like to help us out - please make some noise for us! Like our page or share our posts on Facebook or Twitter.

<h2>When and Where You Can See It:</h2>

</div></div>","About the Show:
The final piece of the Kennedy Center Award-winning play series The Suicidal Comedies,  Cracks follows a gifted young biochemist named Nicole who is trying to unboil an egg.  When she meets Kat, a tech developer trying to stop Global Warming, romance sparks between the two women. But first, Nicole must confront the explosive ending of her last relationship, with the help of a giant egg named Humpty Dumpty.
Cracks explores the ways in which mental illness shapes not only our own lives, but the lives of those around us. It is funny, insightful, and immensely powerful, and we can't wait to share it with you.

About the Company:
The team behind the Kennedy Center Award-winning The Suicidal Comedies is thrilled to announce that the final play in the series, Cracks, will make its debut at this year’s FringeNYC.
As a series, The Suicidal Comedies won the Jean Kennedy Smith Playwriting Award from the Kennedy Center.  The first two plays in the series have been produced across the country, but both started at FringeNYC, where Chemistry won FringeNYC’s Excellence in Playwriting Award, and Coping won FringeNYC’s Excellence in Acting Award and was voted a FringeFAVE.
Other FringeNYC shows that members of our team have worked on include Recipe for Success with Chef Michael Denardi, I Was Loved by a Rat, Portrait and a Dream, and Meet Murasaki Shikibu.

 
What We've Done So Far:

Applied and been accepted into FringeNYC 2018
Assembled an incredibly talented cast
Created our rehearsal schedule
Designed our beautiful set
Created a kick-ass logo
Launched our Social Media Campaign


What We Still Need: 
As much as we are trying to keep our production on a limited budget, our actors and production team spend endless time and energy to create meaningful, poignant work. Everyone deserves to be compensated for their time, not just in gratitude and applause (Although we love both)!  And there are lots of other expenses that go into bringing a show to life. Here are some of the costs we need your help to cover:
Stipend for one actor: $300
Stipends for our Producer, Writer, Director, Marketing and Press Director, Lighting Designer, Composer, Set Designer, Costume Designer, Stage Manager, Graphic Designer, and Photographer: $1300
15 dozen hard boiled eggs (come see the show to find out what they’re for!): $100
Rehearsal Space: $800
U-Haul rental to transport our set: $250
Insurance to cover our actors during rehearsal and performance: $100
Press Mailing services, so we can share our story with reviewers, press agents, and industry folks: $150
Costumes, Set, and Flame-Proofing: $950
Digital Advertising: $200
While some of the funding will be raised via ticket sales, we are hoping to raise $8,500 to cover the difference.
REMEMBER, NO DONATION IS TOO SMALL. Even $1 buys us half a dozen eggs!

Not able to come see the show?!
A ticket to see us at FringeNYC is $22. Consider donating the cost of a ticket to the campaign.
If you cannot come see the show or support us financially, but you would still like to help us out - please make some noise for us! Like our page or share our posts on Facebook or Twitter. That makes such a difference for us, and you never know who will end up coming to see us and spreading the word about our show!
Use the links above (you'll see them to the left of the video) to let your family and friends know about Cracks.
When and Where You Can See It:
This year, Fringe is working a little differently! Rather than going directly to the theatre, you’ll meet at the central FringeHUB, located at 685 Washington Street, where a Fringe Ambassador will take you to the venue.
Please note:
There is NO LATE SEATING during performances. Please plan on arriving at least 15 minutes early to make sure you don’t miss the show..

<h3>Why Twelfth Night?</h3>
<p>It's a great story. But, beyond that, the way that this particular world tempers expansive humor with profound sorrow is unique. The brand of absurdity it affords as the characters engage in their struggle for footing in an ever-changing world can feel incredibly timely. Laughter and tears are near neighbors here.</p>
<p>The intimacy of the Powel House and the ensemble of passionate, capable artists afford a rare chance to invest in the full humanity the play offers. </p>
<p>Director Dan Hodge has assembled a company of actors ranging from recent college graduates to seasoned Philadelphia favorites, with an eye toward cultivating the promise of the former while challenging the prowess of the latter. This fosters internal mentorship, combining depth and experience with energy and bravery - showcasing artists in a way that invigorates the Powel House audiences, and bringing Twelfth Night to life in a way never before felt in this city.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Every cent raised goes directly to the acting company and the space. With no overhead costs, everything you give has a tangible result in the room – or buys our time in the room itself! </p>
<p>Regardless of what we raise, the budget is set at a mere $4,500 with over 50% going directly to actor salaries. </p>
<p>So, what do you get?</p>
<p>Seats of your choice in the intimate Powel House Ballroom, reserved in your name with a postcard signed by the entire cast.</p>
<p>An invitation to one of two exclusive events:</p>
<p>TOBY’S PARTY! – A raucous evening of jokes, laughter and music with the cast, with Toby’s requisite “cakes and ale.”</p>
<p>MALVOLIO’S GARRET – An night of chat and theatre talk with the cast and director. While Malvolio tends toward “daylight and champagne,” you are more likely to find good wine and hearty cheese…</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>A Great City deserves Great Art. Not only will this production sparkle with humor and sadness, it serves the greater purpose of challenging artists both new and established to reach for the fullest of their craft. It is an investment in the present project and the future growth of each company member.</p>
<p><i>Twelfth Night</i> will be free to the public at every performance – we will solicit donations with every dollar being split evenly among the acting company. This radical model removes any obstacle between your personal (and financial) investment in the show, and the welfare of the artists bringing the work to you.</p>
<p>And this is only the beginning. The success of this project promises more productions that emphasize the humanity and intimacy that lay within these great plays. This could be the beginning not only of a stunning ensemble, but a sea change in how we engage with Shakespeare’s works in this city. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Tell your friends! And not just the kind of friends who cut checks – the kind of folks who like going to dinner and seeing a show. Or the kind of friends who cry at the movies, or even at a good commercial. The kind of friends who bring the whole of themselves anywhere.</p>
<p>And call (or email) the folks at the Powel and tell them how glad you are that they present projects like this. </p>
<p>If you’re feeling particularly whimsical, you could swing by with a pie or some cold beer on a performance night. It’s not unlikely that your generosity could gain some stage time of its own!</p>

<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>""What if I fall? Oh, but my darling, what if you fly?”</p>
<p>                                    -Erin Hanson</p>
<p>I have a voice and something to say. Oddly, this realization came to me only recently. I discovered I want to make a noise! Please  donate and help me cause a commotion! </p>
<p>I Came To Make Noise is my writing and directorial debut. With your help, I will show my vision to the world. Through dance, beatbox and spoken word, 3 women share their fears, faults and journeys to self-awareness. You can help me bring I Came To Make Noise to the 2018 Hollywood Fringe Festival. </p>
<p>You’d think the daughter of an artist, who watched her Dad impact the lives of so many with his music, would have instinctively known she had something to say? A dancer, whose first memories are recording music videos on VHS and playing them over and over to learn the moves exactly, not listening to her own body? A choreographer, who has been blessed to help others tell their stories, ignorant of her own story? </p>
<p>All that changed in 2016 when I was nominated for an NAACP Theatre Award for Best Choreographer for Dreamscape, which depicts the death and inner life of a young woman, “Myeisha Mills.” I realized: I have a voice and people are listening!  It’s a thrilling time in my life. I hope you will be a part of this amazing journey! </p>
<p>My name is Carrie Mikuls and I am here to make noise! </p>
<p>This is a story I want to share with others in hopes that it will touch them as it has touched me. The issues of race, politics, and sexual assault are in the forefront of America. I believe by pushing these issues further and continuing the dialogue I Came To Make Noise will make a positive influence on the world. I want to talk about, process and shake-up the issues that affect many others, and me the best way I know how: Through my art.</p>

<p>The show will go on!</p>
<p>We’ve chosen a flexible funding campaign so that even if we don’t hit our goal of $6,000.00 we can still produce the show. Supporting my journey in the creation of this piece is important and fun. You can donate to different tiers and receive cool bonuses like: a special a thank you on social media pages, a personalized thank you video from the cast, and tickets to the show.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>When first creating this show I was inspired by this quote from Buddha,</p>
<p>""Teach this triple truth to all: a generous heart, kind speech, and a life of service and compassion are the thing which renew humanity.""</p>
<p>This is the way I try to move through the world. With our current political climate and, seemingly, so much negativity surrounding us, I have to find a way to bring positivity into the world. The issues in this piece are hard to talk about, but we have to start making noise and informing each other! I know the audiences will identify with the insecurities, pain, and emotions that are exposed-raw on stage. Focusing less on our differences and more on our similarities; we are human, we are enough.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We received The Hollywood Fringe 2018 Scholarship! Producing this show is worth the risks and challenges.</p>
<p>I am terrified and thrilled to be taking such a HUGE artistic leap and life-changing goal! I am ready to walk this path. With your help the road will be easier. </p>
<p>I will learn valuable lessons and grow from this experience. In order to succeed I have to take the risks. It reminds me of the quote by Erin Hanson,</p>

</div><p>Hey: thanks. We won't let you down. We promise.</p></div>","We're square product theatre. 
Maybe you already know us, but if you don't, here's some info:
square product theatre was founded in 2006 with an eye toward providing affordable, inclusive, professional theatre to the Boulder/Denver community. We've presented a variety of new, innovative performance work including:

16 World Premieres
11 Regional Premieres 

We've showcased our original work in Denver, Austin, and Chicago, in addition to our home base of Boulder, Colorado.
We love collaborating to create and present new, challenging, and thought-provoking work. We hope you'll check us out.
About Ranch Dressing and Other Coping Mechanisms:
In late 2015, square product presented the world premiere of Ranch Dressing and Other Coping Mechanisms,  a new solo show from Kelsie Huff, beloved and award-winning creator and performer of HUFFS, Brusier: Tales from a Traumatized Tomboy, and This Show Might be Terrible. We believe in the hilarity and beauty of this show, and are thrilled to have the chance to stage it in New York as an Official Selection of the United Solo Theatre Festival.
Here's a show description:
Imaginary sharks lurking in everyday toilets. Violent encounters with Santa Claus. Indulgence in murderous fantasies. Road trip games gone horribly awry. Chicago-based comedian and storyteller Kelsie Huff's hilarious and poignant journey to sobriety reveals an America in which vice is a part of life, legacy is an everyday battle, and the biggest challenge is learning to accept who you are.Recommended for: adults only (not suitable for children), recovering alcoholics, people with dysfunctional families, anyone traumatized by Steven Spielberg's ""Jaws"".
Our hope is that our participation in the United Solo Festival will provide us with a platform that will help us continue to showcase our original work at venues across the United States.

Well, neither did I until 2016, when my world was rocked by a breast cancer diagnosis. Overnight, I went from being a healthy, vegan runner to a cancer patient.

<li>You donations will help fund travel expenses, as well as room and board. It's a one man show, so luckily you're just helping get me and my show out there to America!</li>
<li>Your donations will also cover each Fringe Festival's expenses like the application fees, registration fees, and publicity; like flyers and posters to help get the show seen. </li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>I have been working on ABEYANCE for over a year now, and I first performed it at the Tucson Fringe Festival. This was a crazy first for me, having never performed or been to a Fringe Festival before. The experience was unforgettable with the new people I met and the shows I saw. After that I was hooked an wanted to share my show with others. </li>
<li>ABEYANCE was the winner of two awards from the Tucson Fringe Festival. The first being ""Best Solo Show"" and the second was ""The Spirit of the Fringe"" Award. Both of these are a true honor, because they were voted on by the audiences which made it even better.  </li>
<li>I love making people laugh and performing, and ABEYANCE (I hope) makes people happy and forget about the outside world for just an hour. And that's why I want to share it with as many people as I can. </li>

</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>I put this show together all by myself, with the help of a few colleagues. And even though I'm not a professional Fringe Festival artist who has been touring for years, I think I have the passion and drive to get me these places.</li>
<li>I have already been accepted and assigned to these festivals. So I geared up and ready to go! Having a community to support this project is amazing, but if I didn't have it I would have gone anyway!</li>

You donations will help fund travel expenses, as well as room and board. It's a one man show, so luckily you're just helping get me and my show out there to America!

<h3>After over a decade and 33 million hits it's time for an upgrade to one of the world's most popular play download website - alexbroun.com</h3>
<p>alexbroun.com is where students, teachers, community groups and theatre companies go to download great plays they can read, enjoy and perform quickly and cheaply - all written by me, Alex Broun.</p>
<p>It caters for actors and theatre-makers from 9 to 90 and people love my plays from Western Australia to Wisconsin from Tokyo to Toronto and Dubai to Denmark.</p>
<p>A short play costs just AUD$2.99 and a full length play AUD$4.99 - and that includes royalties for performances!</p>
<p>But technology moves fast and the site has become outdated and sometimes doesn't work properly ... sometimes people don't get the plays they've ordered! )-:</p>
<p>Also it's hard to update so I can't put up all the great news about productions of my plays happening all over the world.</p>
<p>My plays are most popular with a young adult audience and they are used to cutting edge, fun, easy to use and great to look at websites - currently alexbroun.com just ain't cutting it!</p>
<p>It's like a museum when it should be like a fun park!</p>
<p>So we desperately need alex.broun.com V2.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How can you help</h3>
<p>I've identified a great new web designer <strong><a href=""https://www.element8.ae/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Element 8</a></strong> in Dubai who can do a super cool redesign of the site for just US$5,000 (around AUD$7000.)</p>
<p>I've be sharing all the stages of the development right here on the campaign so you can a sneak peak of how it's going to look - but for now I can tell you it will be fun to use, great to look at and super easy for you to purchase your chosen scripts.</p>
<p>You can donate as little as $10 to $1000 and there are some great perks like <strong>free scripts</strong>, a <strong>thank you on the website </strong>and in<strong> social media</strong>, a copy of my book on<strong> How to write a 10-minute play</strong>, one of my highly acclaimed <strong>free online playwriting courses </strong>and you can even <strong>commission me to write a play for you on any subject you like</strong>.</p>
<p>My friend Phillip McDonald commissioned me to write a play in my Pozible campaign in 2013. The result was <strong>Grace</strong> - which has gone on to be one of my most successful ten minute plays.</p>

<h3>The New Site</h3>
<p>With your help I can complete a brand new-look website that will attract even more actors, directors and theatre companies to my plays and hopefully you'll see even more of my play on stages across the globe.</p>
<p>Students and small independent theatre groups love my plays as its so easy (and cheap) to access them from my website, and once they've downloaded the plays that also gives them permission to perform the plays for a whole year so they don't have to go through the time-consuming and expensive business of applying for rights to perform the play.</p>
<p>I am delighted to say that i am already one of the world's most performed short playwrights, some people even kindly refer to me as the ""Shakespeare of short plays"" - and I'm not stopping them!</p>
<p>To date I have had 123 different short plays, produced in over 1750 productions in 48 countries around the world and my plays have been translated into eight languages.</p>
<p>The three most popular countries for my plays are the USA with a huge 815 productions, Australia with 441 productions and India with 99.</p>
<p>I've had my plays produced in 49 US states with only Hawaii and New Hampshire to collect the full set. (Come on Hawaii and New Hampshire - do one of my plays!)</p>
<p>My three most popular plays are <i>10,000 cigarettes</i>, with 279 productions, <i>The First Fireworks</i>, with 218 and <i>The Kill </i>with 63.</p>

</div></div>","After over a decade and 33 million hits it's time for an upgrade to one of the world's most popular play download website - alexbroun.com
alexbroun.com is where students, teachers, community groups and theatre companies go to download great plays they can read, enjoy and perform quickly and cheaply - all written by me, Alex Broun.
It caters for actors and theatre-makers from 9 to 90 and people love my plays from Western Australia to Wisconsin from Tokyo to Toronto and Dubai to Denmark.
A short play costs just AUD$2.99 and a full length play AUD$4.99 - and that includes royalties for performances!
But technology moves fast and the site has become outdated and sometimes doesn't work properly ... sometimes people don't get the plays they've ordered! )-:
Also it's hard to update so I can't put up all the great news about productions of my plays happening all over the world.
My plays are most popular with a young adult audience and they are used to cutting edge, fun, easy to use and great to look at websites - currently alexbroun.com just ain't cutting it!
It's like a museum when it should be like a fun park!
So we desperately need alex.broun.com V2.

How can you help
I've identified a great new web designer Element 8 in Dubai who can do a super cool redesign of the site for just US$5,000 (around AUD$7000.)
I've be sharing all the stages of the development right here on the campaign so you can a sneak peak of how it's going to look - but for now I can tell you it will be fun to use, great to look at and super easy for you to purchase your chosen scripts.
You can donate as little as $10 to $1000 and there are some great perks like free scripts, a thank you on the website and in social media, a copy of my book on How to write a 10-minute play, one of my highly acclaimed free online playwriting courses and you can even commission me to write a play for you on any subject you like.
My friend Phillip McDonald commissioned me to write a play in my Pozible campaign in 2013. The result was Grace - which has gone on to be one of my most successful ten minute plays.
I also encouraged and guided Phillip to write his own play based on the same idea, The Last Three Blondes, which that went on to reach the finals of Short+Sweet in Sydney - he even beat Grace to reach the finals! So success all around.

The New Site
With your help I can complete a brand new-look website that will attract even more actors, directors and theatre companies to my plays and hopefully you'll see even more of my play on stages across the globe.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>House of Jack is a dance organisation based in Leith, Edinburgh that focuses on street and urban dance, founded by award-winning hip hop dancer, teacher and choreographer, Ashley Jack. </p>
<p>Since launching two and a half years ago, House of Jack has been gathering momentum, offering dance classes and workshops for both kids and adults, as well as youth company training, events and performances.</p>
<p>Our student numbers have continued to grow and we enjoyed a large amount of attention during 2019, with our young dancers invited to perform at the Festival Theatre (a curtain-raiser for Rosie Kay Dance Company's '10 Soldiers', and at 25 Live), at the Lyceum (as the Sugar Army in Oona Doherty's 'Hard to be Soft' in the Edinburgh International Festival - this week named as The Guardian's number 1 dance show of 2019 in the UK!), and at the Scottish Parliament's 20th Birthday, among many other events, as well as our adult dancers having performed at The List Hot 100 event.  Our second Christmas Show, on 24 November 2019 at the Church Hill Theatre, involved all House of Jack's young people from Primary 1 up to our youth dance companies, and was a sell-out success!  We can't wait for what 2020 brings! </p>
<p>However, Shapes Studio, where all classes and workshops have been held until now, was unable to renew their lease beyond the end of 2019, leading us to work very hard to secure a new studio for House of Jack, so that we would be able to continue providing training for all our students!  The new studio will be House of Jack's very own studio, located within Ocean Terminal shopping centre and opening in mid-January 2020.  It will have safer, step-free access, lots of free parking, a reception and waiting area, and lots of amenities on-hand in the centre. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We're very happy to have been able to secure a new studio for House of Jack, and excited about the future there, however this necessary move inevitably involves a lot of unavoidable costs!  We're looking for funding to help cover the costs of installing a wall to divide the studio and reception areas, soundproofing, mirrors, music system and to lay dance flooring in the studio. </p>
<p>We would very much welcome any donations you feel able to give (see the 'Huge Thanks' and 'Eternal Gratitude' items on the list!) but we're also offering lots of lovely perks in return for funding, including entry to our launch weekend disco, limited edition t-shirts, hoodies, snapbacks, water bottles, private tuition sessions, and videography sessions!</p>
<p>We've set our funding campaign to flexible funding - we'd love to reach (beyond) the full funding goal set here, but whatever amount we do manage to raise will all go towards as many of the costs as possible.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>House of Jack is a non-profit organisation, focusing on providing street dance training and events to Edinburgh and Scotland. We aim to be as accessible as possible, such as by keeping class prices low, providing free rehearsal sessions, not asking students to pay for performance costumes, and so on, to give as much benefit as possible to our community. </p>
<p>Going into 2020, we really hope to be able to provide the best facilities we can, in a well-equipped studio, so that we can continue providing training to all our students of all ages, and working towards our goal of becoming a centre of excellence in urban dance. Funding will make all the difference in getting us off to a good start and having a sustainable future! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you're not able to directly help by funding this campaign, we'd appreciate it so much if you could share our funding page with others, to spread the word as much as possible!  :) </p>

We would very much welcome any donations you feel able to give (see the 'Huge Thanks' and 'Eternal Gratitude' items on the list!) but we're also offering lots of lovely perks in return for funding, including entry to our launch weekend disco, limited edition t-shirts, hoodies, snapbacks, water bottles, private tuition sessions, and videography sessions!
We've set our funding campaign to flexible funding - we'd love to reach (beyond) the full funding goal set here, but whatever amount we do manage to raise will all go towards as many of the costs as possible.

The Impact
House of Jack is a non-profit organisation, focusing on providing street dance training and events to Edinburgh and Scotland. We aim to be as accessible as possible, such as by keeping class prices low, providing free rehearsal sessions, not asking students to pay for performance costumes, and so on, to give as much benefit as possible to our community. 
Going into 2020, we really hope to be able to provide the best facilities we can, in a well-equipped studio, so that we can continue providing training to all our students of all ages, and working towards our goal of becoming a centre of excellence in urban dance. Funding will make all the difference in getting us off to a good start and having a sustainable future! 

Other Ways You Can Help
If you're not able to directly help by funding this campaign, we'd appreciate it so much if you could share our funding page with others, to spread the word as much as possible!  :)",0.0,0,"1 Campaign
