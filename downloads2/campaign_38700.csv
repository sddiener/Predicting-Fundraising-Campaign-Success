<h3><strong>Cholera is killing in Haiti. PureLives has a solution.</strong></h3>
<p><em><strong>But we need your help. </strong></em></p>
<p>PureLives is a ground-breaking portable technology that offers a new take on filtering water for drinking purposes. With just one step, PureLives uses gravity to remove bacteria, viruses, organic chemicals, dirt and debris revealing 99.9% clean water.</p>
<p>In the 2- 3 minutes it takes for the filter to work, a user has 5 gallons of portable water in a backpack.</p>
<p>The unfortunate situation in Haiti is that cholera is contaminating the drinking supply and water nationwide.  The average family spends the American equivalent of $7,000 a year, $584 a month, $147 a week, $21 a day<em>...on water alone...</em>this technology can make a world of a difference. PureLives is not only a way to make the water drinkable again.</p>
<p><strong>PureLives can be used by Haitian entrepreneurs to create a long-lasting sustainable solution towards economic freedom. Our goal is to empower people to save their own lives. Haitians will ultimately Be their own Water Heroes. </strong> </p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Your contribution</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Gifts/Perks:</strong> Do you want to get your hands on the first water filter in a backpack? Choose the Buy One Get One option. You'll be sending a PureLives unit to a Haitian family and get one for yourself to keep!</p>
<p>Donate $10, 25, 100 or more and receive a Water Hero t-shirt, water bottle, a photo of the family you sponosr with a PureLives product, your personal logo on the product or a PureLives unit of your own.</p>
<p>If you'd like for everone in Haiti to know your company cared, choose the Water Hero: Corporate Sponsor, Company Sponsor 10 or Sponsor 5 Families &amp; Logo. </p>
<p><strong>Where Your Money Goes:</strong> The money you give will fund the production, manufacturing, shipping and distribution of over 100 PureLives to be gifted to families in Haiti. We have already done our research by speaking to individuals in Haiti about their current methods of obtaining clean water, the vast improvement PureLives would bring to the process, and the best design for the average Haitian family to use on a daily basis. The question we were asked last is “When can we have these?” Your involvement will help us answer with “Now.”</p>
<p>Here's how the numbers breakdown: </p>
<p>It costs about $75 to get a PureLives assembled, shipped and to keep our 4 employees afloat. If we raise a goal of $7,500, that means 100 full Haitian families will receive a PureLives and a backpack. 100 families will have access to portable in-home water filters. 100 families will be saved from contaminated water. </p>
<p>Your support will not only provide a most useful clean water filter to families in Haiti, but you will also receive a perk for your own use. </p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""> </span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Why PureLives?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Clean water is one of the most basic elements of human life<em>.</em></strong> We all need it to survive. Still, there are 3.4 million people (WHO2008) in the world that don’t have access to it. In Haiti, where the average annual household income is $650 a year, 10 – 26% of a family's income goes to buying clean water. For the average American household that would mean nearly $7,000 of the average annual income would go into buying water alone.</p>
<p>The families that receive a PureLives unit from this campaign will have 3-5 years of free access to clean water.</p>
<p>PureLives has a different take on water than most other filters. Other filters require complicated pumps that need instruction manuals, electricity which is inaccessible for many people, or chemicals like chlorine that not only leaves a bad taste in the water, but can also pose a threat to health. PureLives, however, uses a 3-phase gravity-flow filtration system with no harsh chemicals, electricity or pumps. </p>
<p>A family simply takes the filter to a nearby river, lake, stream or well, pours water into the top of the filter and in 3 mintues tops, has 5 gallons of clean water to take home. </p>
<p>Our goal is to empower people to save their own lives. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Our Motivation:</strong></p>
<p>George Page, the creator of PureLives, has been a water filtration engineer for over 9 years. He was moved to use his experience and knowledge to help people who need it most after witnessing the devestating earthquake in Haiti. With an idea and the skills to match, George created PureLives in 2012, visited with families in Haiti to determine the practicality of its usage, and continued to shape and craft the system until now. With this final design, PureLives is ready to be used by families in Haiti who want to drink cholera-free water. </p>
<p>The team of 4 and 2 interns that are working diligently to get the product out to you and the world is a group of sustainability, user-designed focused, social media aware, smart folks that care about lives being saved. </p>

<p>Can you imagine growing up in a world of technology, never having played
unsupervised outside? Can you imagine not knowing that the food you are eating
was once a plant or animal? Can you imagine being afraid to walk down a forest
trail because there might be snakes or insects? Can you imagine never having
walked on anything but asphalt, concrete and artificial flooring? We don't have
to imagine; we have met these people, both children and adults, by the thousands.
They live in an artificial world devoid of any connection to the natural world,
their lives focused around the entertainment available through their
technology. They see nature as a hostile place, not anywhere they would want to
be, and certainly not a place they would be comfortable.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/817273/files/20140827175440-Carmen_Corridino_cooking_reduced.jpg?1409187280"" src="""" style=""width: 567.828px; height: 425px;""/></p>When we become aliens in our own natural environment we lose a part of ourselves,

our modern museums where ancient skills are displayed behind glass, with
written descriptions defining interesting facts and where the very clear
message is ""don't touch!""  What
if instead a person could hop out of their car, walk down a trail and walk back
into history, to a village living in the ancient ways. They feel the grass
beneath their feet. They help tan the hide of an animal that gave its life to
clothe and feed the village. They go on a walk with a Resident to help them
gather wild edible plants, seeing the gratitude given to each plant that gives their life to sustain us . They sit by a person flintknapping a stone knife and
wonder, perhaps for the first time, how their pocket knife was created. They
make a fire from two pieces of wood and touch a place deep inside themselves
that responds to this connection with fire in a way unavailable by striking a match. They explore and laugh, touch and
discover. They have dirt on their pants from sitting by the fire and they feel
alive in a way they've never felt before. They've challenged themselves with
something new and perhaps a bit scary for them. They've learned new skills and
spent the day wrapped in the beauty and wonder of nature. They've had an
adventure; not some movie or action game on the computer, but real,
invigorating, life-expanding adventure. <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/817282/files/20140827175621-Roush_4_reduced.jpg?1409187381"" src="""" style=""width: 561.922px; height: 567px;""/></p>We've seen this work; how transformative an experience it can be to just be

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Community Fruit Harvesting was started by Di Celliers on the North Shore of Auckland when she noticed fruit rotting on the ground in backyards in her community at the same time as reading newspaper reports about the growing demands on local food banks and charities providing food to needy families. Killing two birds with one stone she gathered some friends as volunteers and set out to pick the fruit. The fruit is then shared with the tree owner and local charities such as Auckland City Mission.</p>
<p>I read about this scheme in our local newspaper 2 weeks ago and was immediately inspired to go out picking with my family. And in just over an hour we picked over 60 kg of juicy, delicious tangelos of 2 medium sized trees. All the children involved had a great time, and then 2 days later 500-600 tangelos (full of vitamin C - perfect for winter health) were dropped off at the Auckland City Mission to be distributed.<br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The Community Fruit Harvesting scheme is brilliant on so many levels:</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>* It<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> builds community </span>by connecting pickers and fruit growers in their local areas and giving them a worthwhile mission of donating healthy fruit to charities<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>* It<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> creates independent local food systems</span> by tapping into under-utilized food resources in our backyards</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>* It is<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> environmentally sustainable </span>and reduces waste by ensuring that fruit that would otherwise rot on the ground gets picked</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>* It <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">educates us about the environment </span>and gets us and our children outside. When we went picking for the first time a few weeks ago the fruit tree owner's son gave us a hand as did my own sons and it was proclaimed ""More fun than watching Star Wars!""</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>* It <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">helps people in need</span> as the majority of fruit goes to charities who use it in their food boxes. It improves nutrition for these people - like the vitamin C in the tangelos we picked AND saves the charities valuable funds to be used on other foods.<br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need <br/>
</h3>
<p>While our fruit picking experience was great, it would have been so much more productive if we just had a few simple tools. If we had some extension fruit pickers we would have been able to get 10-20% more fruit off the tangelo trees. And if the trees had been larger we would have definitely needed them.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>So we are looking for are some funds to purchase the basic tools for 5 different Community Harvest Groups starting throughout the greater Auckland region. If we are successful this would give each group the basic tools they need to start. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>10 x extension fruit pickers at NZ$129 (US$110) each<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>10 x plastic fruit crates at NZ$30 (US$26) each<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>GRAND TOTAL of NZ $1590.00  (US$1350 )</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Any extra cash we raise will be passed on to other Community Fruit Harvesting groups to allow them to purchase similar tools. You can see Di modelling one of the extension fruit pickers in the photo.<br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>There are 3 other ways you can help:</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>1. You can donate the fruit you have in your backyard</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>2. You can volunteer to pick fruit and deliver it to local charities</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>3. You can spread the word about Community Fruit Harvesting for us - or start it in your local area. Di and Community Fruit Harvesting are happy to share all their knowledge (including flyers to drop in mail boxes in your area, and spreadsheets to coordinate the picking) to help you get started.<br/></p>

An inverter takes the power that comes from the panels, which is direct current ( DC ) and changes it to alternating current ( AC ). AC is what we have in the outlets in our homes and at work. String-Inverters are large, expensive and less efficient. Just a little shading of just one part, of just one module can severely compromise the performance of the whole array system. They generate large amounts of heat and have a short life span as evidenced by typical warranty period of just 5 years. They also require high-voltage DC wiring which is dangerous when damaged or installed improperly. Micro-Inverters use low voltage AC wiring and significantly reduce the risk of fire or injury. </p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FoWvM1PP5Lt8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DoWvM1PP5Lt8&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FoWvM1PP5Lt8%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p><span><span><br/></span></span></p><p></p><h4>Micro-Inverters have changed everything. </h4><p>Instead of modules being wired together to create high voltage DC that is sent to an inverter near your main service panel, now each PV Module is equipped with it's own Micro-Inverter.

unless we urgently adopt “radical” measures to suppress GHG emissions ( 50%
cuts in emissions by 2020,  90% by 2050)
we’re headed for an average temperature rise of 3 degrees or 4 degrees Celsius
before the end of the century. Four degrees may not sound like much, but make
no mistake: Such an increase will be catastrophic for our species and most
others. 
“Heat waves of undreamed of ferocity will scorch the Earth’s
surface as the climate becomes hotter than anything humans have ever
experienced… There will be no ice at either pole”  “global warming of this magnitude would leave
the whole planet without ice for the first time in nearly 40 million
years”  Sea levels will rise 35 meters –
submerging Florida, Bangladesh, New York, Washing DC, London, Shanghai, the
coastlines and cities where nearly half the world’s population presently live.
Fresh water aquifers will dry up; snow caps and glaciers will evaporate and
with them, the rivers that feed the billions in Asia, South America and
California. The ”wholesale destruction of ecosystems “ will bring the collapse
of agriculture around much of the world. …. With food supplies crashing , humanity’s  grip on it’s future  will become ever more tentative. “Yet long
before the temperature hits four degrees, the melting will have begun thawing
the permafrost of the Artic, releasing vast quantities of methane buried under
the artic seas and the Siberian and the North American tundra, accelerating GHG
concentrations  beyond any human power to
stop runaway warming and sealing the fate of the species. - by Richard Smith and first published in the Real-World
Economics Review.What You Can  DO About Climate Change NOW!This is New School Solar with The Affordable Power Panel.This innovative mounting system ""REDUCES""  PV Solar Panel Installation Labor cost by 75%. It is lightweight, more safe, easy to install, guaranteed not to leak and gives a quicker Return on Investment ( ROI ).The Flexible Thin Film Advantage

    Do-it-Yourself?   For Some People                        Plug & Play?      Close Enough                         This is an innovative Mounting System that attaches Flexible Thin Film Laminate PV Solar Modules (2nd Generation, Multi-Junction, PV Solar Technology) to asphalt shingle roofs, as found on over 85% of Americas homes and businesses.The Affordable Power Panel is an easy to install, durable, lightweight, less expensive, leak free way to install photovoltaic power to your sloped shingle roof in Affordable Increments. Flexible thin film "" Peal & Stick "" PhotoVoltaic Modules as invented and developed by Stanford Ovshinsky in the 1970's ( Stan Ovshinskys' inventions from 50 years ago enabled cell phones, laptops, and flat-screen TVs ) have recently made significant gains in overall Standard Test Conditions ( STC ) efficiency ratings making it now watt for watt competitive with crystalline silicone solar modules as predominantly used today. The video below first aired on Scientific American Frontiers with Alan Alda on Feb 23, 2005.The Idea.http://cleantechnica.com/2010/11/22/three-innovations-that-will-make-solar-power-easier-and-more-affordable/The article above sparked the idea for this product. When I saw the Flexible Thin Film PV Solar Module applied to a mounting system for gravel topped flat roofs, it peaked my curiosity. I thought why not apply this more durable, light weight PV Solar product to a sloped roof like on houses, churches and apartment buildings... With my 30 plus year roofing background, I designed the ""Steep Slope, CIGS Flexible Thin Film PV Module, Horizontal, Interlocking, Light Weight, Easy to Install, Asphalt Shingle Roof, Mounting System with Concealed, Self Flashing Roof Anchors"" , THAT WILL NOT LEAK, as described below. We currently have Patent Pending on a utility patent for the Affordable Power Panel. Silicone Solar Power has done an extraordinary job providing Renewable Energy from the 1950's up until now and it still does a good job, but now there's a better way.  With crystalline silicone systems it takes highly
skilled engineers and technicians to design and install a PV array system. A basic 1,000 watt system
will cost well over $ 4,500.00 and most homes require 4,000 to 6,000 watt
systems. Well over $ 4000.00 just to get started.With this system you can design your own PV array with our help. We have access to NAPCEP Certified engineers in the cloud that can analyze site information and provide a Permit Package you can then take to your Building Codes Department for Approvals. We have a perk on the right to do that along with other design tools.For more System Design Tool Information - See Our WebSite www.AffordablePowerPanel.com  and go to Solar Soft CostWith the Affordable Power Panel we have a more immediate solution that anyone can get involved with right now. Buy one (1) Affordable Power Panel. Plug it into your wall outlet and stick it where the Sun ""DOES"" Shine. Your'e now a part of the Solution. In the U.S. you also get a 30% Renewable Energy Tax Credit. You can get started now with a single panel and add to it as you wish. Or you can order a 6+ kW. system and have it installed by others, or you can install it yourself, we'll have instructions and YouTube videos for that. The main point is to just Do It, NOW! Crystalline Silicone PV Modules have glass surfaces, are framed in metal, & attached to metal racks. All adding to the array weight, making structural engineering reports and sometimes structural improvements necessary.Flexible Thin Film Laminated PV Modules are durable ( no glass to break ), have superior hail impact resistance, are light weight, & easily applied to flat, smooth surfaces.Installing Flexible Thin Film Laminated PV Modules to the flat, smooth surfaced portion of this Standing Seam Metal Roof.Flexible Thin Film Laminated PV Module being applied to the flat, smooth surfaced, TPO Single Ply Roofing Material. Due to Factory Mutual, FM I-90 requirements, installing a Flexible Thin Film Laminated PV Module to the irregular, granulated surface of this asphalt shingle roof, is not permissible.1. MATCHING EFFICIENCY  LEVELS: The table below indicates that the efficiency level of CIGS Flexible Thin Film PV Solar Modules have finally caught up to that of polycrystalline Silicone PV Modules.  source: PhotoVoltaic Systems, James Dunlop, third edition.2. NEW RACKING / INSTALLATION OPTIONS: Most people would be surprised to learn that at least 25% of the equipment cost and 75% of the labor cost of rooftop installed solar kits go's into the racking system that hold the solar panels to the the roof. This technology hasn't changed much in 60 years. This process of mounting bolts through the roof surface, rails to hold the panels and wiring plus, grounding systems are time consuming, (600 volt DC) dangerous and expensive.Each panel has an identical profile:First Picture: Shows two separate panels. First the starter strip shown at the lower left is mechanically attached the the roof rafter through the roof and roof decking. The lower edge of the bottom panel locks into the starter strip securing it to the roof. The starter strip and the deck screws are now out-of-sight and water tight. The fastener slot at the top of the panel is now secured to the rafter, through the roof.Second Picture: Shows the second panel locked into the first now covering the screws of the first panel making them watertight. The second panel is then fastened to the roof. The installation continues in this manner to the last panel. All screws are covered and watertight. Third Picture:  The screws of the last panel are covered with the head flashing that clips to the top lock. The head flashing is flashed to the roof using standard roofing practices as shown in the installation manual. The microinverters and electrical lines on the left are shielded with a raceway cover. There are no exposed fasteners, This system will not leak! This is no Fufu solar panel packed in plastic with batteries included to charge your cell phone. This is an industrial strength mounting system that will mount commercial quality, flexible thin film solar modules to your roof. At the end of service life for the PV module, we can strip off the   original and attach a new, much more efficient PV module. This is done while the original mounting system remains on the roof. This mounting system is ""On the Roof Recyclable"".The Next Major Breakthrough in PhotoVoltaic Power is the MICRO-INVERTERMicro-Inverters are great for Affordability and Efficiency.Inverters are an essential piece of a solar power system. An inverter takes the power that comes from the panels, which is direct current ( DC ) and changes it to alternating current ( AC ). AC is what we have in the outlets in our homes and at work. String-Inverters are large, expensive and less efficient. Just a little shading of just one part, of just one module can severely compromise the performance of the whole array system. They generate large amounts of heat and have a short life span as evidenced by typical warranty period of just 5 years. They also require high-voltage DC wiring which is dangerous when damaged or installed improperly. Micro-Inverters use low voltage AC wiring and significantly reduce the risk of fire or injury. Micro-Inverters have changed everything. Instead of modules being wired together to create high voltage DC that is sent to an inverter near your main service panel, now each PV Module is equipped with it's own Micro-Inverter. The power is converted to 240 volts AC right at the module. This makes the system more efficient and the solar system design more flexible. These advancements have so simplified the Solar Design Process that the National Electrical Code ( NEC ) requirements pertaining to complicated DC array circuits do not apply to these AC modules, as these circuits and conductors are considered internal wiring.Micro-inverters also eliminate the need for other balance-of-system components and lengthy installation times by a DC Certified Electrician. Again, saving you money.You can't EXPECT, from what you don't INSPECT.With this new technology, each micro-inverter can report it's performance to a Communications Gateway via the AC wiring and your internet router. The gateway then sends the data to the website to track the performance of each panel and micro-inverter pair. You are able to view this performance data from any where, on any PC, Tablet or Smartphone. Long gone are the days of "" False Performance Promises and High DeRate Factors"".YOU  Can: 
Verify system health and performance at a glance.
View energy production by month, day or hour.
Analyze Performance against historical weather data.
Share System Performance with friends on Facebook, Twitter...
Compare the performance of your CIGS - Flexible Thin Film PV Module Array System to that of their crystalline silicone system.
Why CROWD FUNDING""But it's gona take money. A whole lot a spending money... too do it right"".  George Harrison says it best.We are seeking your help to buy the necessary equipment to set up a light manufacturing facility to assemble the Affordable Power Panel. Remember, we're not the ones that have had to do the heavy lifting. Global Solar Energy Inc. ( founded in 1996 ) manufacturers and warranties the PV Module we're using ( http://www.globalsolar.com/ ). Power One,  another international company supplies our micro-inverters ( http://ow.ly/vPDzJ ). We just assemble these components onto our mounting panel. Our major expense will be for the roll forming machine. This machine is similar to that used to form steel siding panels, only it will bend a heavier gauge metal to the shape shown in the CAD drawing below.Our machine will look somewhat like this. Approximate dimensions are W. 33.5"" X H. 45"" X L. 138"". A machine similar to those used to form steel siding.This panel is unique. Drawn to our patent pending design and specifications. The design and fabrication of most all the components of this machine are unique to this machine, most everything begins from scratch. CAD representation of our patent pending panel.Panel lengths are determined by a multi-profile guillotine, cut-on-the-fly system, to accommodate the lengths of the multiple wattage modules to be available. This machine has the capacity to produce six ( 6 ), ten foot panels per minute. Our GoalOur ultimate goal is to raise $ 293,000.00. With the understanding that about 56% of the funds raised goes to fulfilling the perks.The First $ 35,000.001.  The first $ 35,000.00 of our goal will be used to build a PV system of each competing technology. An array of polycrystalline silicone PV modules and an array of flexible thin film PV modules. These arrays' will be side by side, facing the same direction and at the same angle to the sun. These arrays will be of similar Standard Test Condition ( STC ) ratings. A pyranometer to measure sunlight intensity will be installed between the two arrays. I want to make a real simple comparison of Solar Radiation Input to kWh Power Output. With the use of microinverters I'll be able to send this information to our website for everyone to view.2. Retain a professional Web Site Developer.3. Hire a NABCEP Certified - General Manager. Stretch Goal: $ 293,000.001.  Acquire custom roll forming machinery and necessary support equipment.2.  Acquire initial inventory of Flexible Thin Film Modules made to our specifications to Maximize Power Density.3.  Acquire initial inventory of Micro-Inverters, Communications Gateways, Cables and Connectors... 4.  Initial order of 140,000 lbs. of .032 mil aluminum coil stock. Initially only aluminum will be available. 5.  Build a working 4-5 kW. prototype system, for instructional photographs and  videos.6.  Further develop marketing and distribution strategies.This all requires minimum orders and up front cash commitments to manufacturers, and suppliers. We can't do it without your help.We have patent pending status on a unique product with in an industry that experienced $ 26 BILLION in sales last year alone. The more money we have available to invest in good people, good policy and the skills to communicate that policy, the faster we become successful. With that success will come lower prices for a better quality PV Solar product.PRODUCTION & SHIPPINGThe Affordable Power Panel is a Mounting Platform for equipment that has already been developed, manufactured and guaranteed by others. Others with research and development departments within their organizations and with the financial backing of Multinational Corporations.  We are attaching a flexible thin film laminate ( roofing type ) material and a micro-inverter ( that already have national and international code and UL approvals ) to a metal panel that nearly replicates a standing seam metal roof system ( as used in various forms for the past 500 years ) and we shifted it's orientation by 90 degrees to stabilize module laminate migration. Shipping cost of individual panels are a major factor for now. Once quantities warrant, different options to bring those cost down will be implemented.There are currently over 75,159,000  owner-occupied housing units in the U. S. If every homeowner bought just one 90 Watt Affordable Power Panel, that alone would add approximately 6.7 gigawatt of electrical power to the grid. To put that in it's proper perspective. We have had record years of PhotoVoltaic Solar Power installations since President Obama has been in office. The total of installations in that period equals 12 gigawatt. We hope to do for the PhotoVoltaic industry, what the assembly line did for the car business. Make PhotoVoltaic Power available to more people, at a price they can afford. Thank you to everyone for your time and consideration. We can't do it with out YOU.This product proudly made in the USAby a Service Connected Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business. For more information about the Affordable Power Panel, go to www.affordablepowerpanel.comDisclaimer: All YouTube videos and articles used in this presentation are to help educate readers about the product and the seriousness of The Climate Crisis.

If we are not able to meet our goal entirely, we will scale back on the amount of data interpretation and reporting we do. For instance, we might check in on C2 less frequently during the winter or skip the winter reporting entirely and only report on him during migration (or, if necessary, only during the return migration next Spring).
If the transmitter that tracks C2's movements is damaged or fails for some reason, our tracking will necessarily come to an end. However, we will still be able to watch for his return to Jamaica Bay and report on it on our website.
The big ""if"" that we hate talking about is the possibility that C2 could be injured and die -- a risk that comes with any wildlife tracking project. All we can say is that if this should happen, we would interpret the data, surmise what we can and report what happened as best we understand it.

<p><strong>About Me:</strong></p>
<p>  My name is Daniel Collins and I am a 27 year old graduate of University of Maryland College Park.  I am a handyman, plumber, inventor, educator, artist, writer, event coordinator, and entrepreneur.  I attended an internship with Earthships Biotecture in 2011 because I had a dream and could tell that they would be able to help me.  I have also participated in the Maryland General Assembly (state government) as a legislative intern and constituent correspondent. </p>
<p><strong>My Project:</strong></p>
<p>  I aim to create a collection of ecologically responsible structures in an accessible location close to MD and VA.  These buildings would together make an eco-campus where research on sustainable techniques can be performed and any functional community-life-supporting area is an open classroom.  This is important to me because I believe that it is our responsibility as a species to evolve our living practices and consciously seek balance and environmental harmony in all of our habitats. </p>
<p>  This facility will generate credibility, research, education, and enthusiasm for the green revolution that is waiting in the wings.  With my biotecture degree I will also be LEED (leaders in ecological engineering and design) certified.  LEED is the national standard for environmental buildings and code.  Therefore not only will you be empowering my personal vision, but you will empower the movement by creating a recognized professional ""green"" building inspector/consultant.  Also, as a plumber and a former legislative assistant in the Maryland General Assembly; I intend to use my new level of credibility to propose ecological and water-management legislature that paves the way for more environmentally responsible building projects.  I am committed to our planet, our species, our country, and with the right credentials I just may be able to serve all with my efforts.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>How to Help and Why:</strong></p>
<p>  I need $4,000.  This will cover the $2,000 tuition, $1500 for room and board, $500 for travel and emergency funds.  I am going to the Earthship Academy no matter what and if I cannot make my $4,000 goal i will be using whatever I do get to get there.</p>
<p>  My perks are designed to connect you to my journey and let everyone know that you gave this project its start.  They range from personal video conferences and video blog shout-outs to your very own strap-case (a hand decorated hard-case combination-lock messenger bag of my own design) or even a permanent dedication on the finished campus.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>  This project will help inspire and empower individuals to live more sustainably.  It will be an aesthetically pleasing and practical park-like environment where you can take the kids for a summer day camp, attend a weekend organic gardening seminar or drop by for lunch and local produce.  </p>
<p>  I am a born entrepreneur and have cooperatively launched three successful start-up businesses which are still operating.  I am a co-founder of: Beautiful Day Landscaping, Green Scene Catering, and Foundation Event Coordination.  I am also the designer of the Greenmount Avenue Commons amphitheater park in Baltimore.  </p>
<p>  Not only am I personally capable and tenacious in the pursuit of my dreams, I am a great organizer of people and have a vast network of supporters and volunteers waiting for the green light to build a new type of school and community.  I would love to count you among us so we can change the way we live together.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>  If you can't afford to donate to my project, don't worry, you can still help!!  Spread the word and get in contact with me about volunteer opportunities.  No matter what your gift is we need it.  Please share this page with your friends, post it on your facebook, and think about how we can make this dream a reality. </p>

  I aim to create a collection of ecologically responsible structures in an accessible location close to MD and VA.  These buildings would together make an eco-campus where research on sustainable techniques can be performed and any functional community-life-supporting area is an open classroom.  This is important to me because I believe that it is our responsibility as a species to evolve our living practices and consciously seek balance and environmental harmony in all of our habitats. 
  This facility will generate credibility, research, education, and enthusiasm for the green revolution that is waiting in the wings.  With my biotecture degree I will also be LEED (leaders in ecological engineering and design) certified.  LEED is the national standard for environmental buildings and code.  Therefore not only will you be empowering my personal vision, but you will empower the movement by creating a recognized professional ""green"" building inspector/consultant.  Also, as a plumber and a former legislative assistant in the Maryland General Assembly; I intend to use my new level of credibility to propose ecological and water-management legislature that paves the way for more environmentally responsible building projects.  I am committed to our planet, our species, our country, and with the right credentials I just may be able to serve all with my efforts.


How to Help and Why:
  I need $4,000.  This will cover the $2,000 tuition, $1500 for room and board, $500 for travel and emergency funds.  I am going to the Earthship Academy no matter what and if I cannot make my $4,000 goal i will be using whatever I do get to get there.
  My perks are designed to connect you to my journey and let everyone know that you gave this project its start.  They range from personal video conferences and video blog shout-outs to your very own strap-case (a hand decorated hard-case combination-lock messenger bag of my own design) or even a permanent dedication on the finished campus.  


  This project will help inspire and empower individuals to live more sustainably.  It will be an aesthetically pleasing and practical park-like environment where you can take the kids for a summer day camp, attend a weekend organic gardening seminar or drop by for lunch and local produce.  
  I am a born entrepreneur and have cooperatively launched three successful start-up businesses which are still operating.  I am a co-founder of: Beautiful Day Landscaping, Green Scene Catering, and Foundation Event Coordination.  I am also the designer of the Greenmount Avenue Commons amphitheater park in Baltimore.  
  Not only am I personally capable and tenacious in the pursuit of my dreams, I am a great organizer of people and have a vast network of supporters and volunteers waiting for the green light to build a new type of school and community.  I would love to count you among us so we can change the way we live together.


  If you can't afford to donate to my project, don't worry, you can still help!!  Spread the word and get in contact with me about volunteer opportunities.  No matter what your gift is we need it.  Please share this page with your friends, post it on your facebook, and think about how we can make this dream a reality.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

The projects I advocate will last from 1-2 years and
cost $8,030 in total.  If the goal is not met, the
project will be scaled down accordingly. 
The project manager will donate some of her time to the projects as
well.  One of the tasks of the project
manager is to work with the village committees to introduce a small fee for
horseback riding, with the proceeds going to sustaining the village ecological
projects.  Funds raised will be distributed in phases to the project manager with photo verification of work completed and periodic telephone calls.

·  Design, develop, prepare, and install a small local ecology exhibition.
· 
Develop and place ecotourism signs around
the village.
· 
Purchase and place garbage cans in
the parking lot and the riding stable. About 300  visitors come to Yuhu a day. 
·

 school children.  Fundraising for this project will begin after the 
successful completion of the current project.)IV. The Impact
If this project is successful, Yuhu can become a
model village for other areas where similar issues have arisen.  This campaign has a high likelihood of success
because it will be directed and run by an experienced, Chinese, Naxi native
environmentalist and a villager of Yuhu.  Ms Lushan Jizhen He has worked with conservation
and tourism companies on education programs and ecotourism projects under the
umbrella of the Nature Conservancy.  She
is fluent in Mandarin, Naxi, and English and an excellent communicator.  Since Ms He has prior experience working with
the local village communities and government agencies, she can
share successes and help others initiate similar
programs elsewhere. Currently, with her husband, she manages a café and hostel
in the heart of Yuhu, an ideal tourist stop. IV. Other Ways You Can Help  

If you cannot donate but you would like to help,
please spread the word to other people about this campaign. Look up “Yuhu,

</h4><h4 style=""text-align: center;""><font class=""Apple-style-span"">SLUMCHELLA started as a plan for an epic event.  Our aim was to bring musicians from all around the world to Kenya to perform in one rural village and one urban slum to rally a grassroots opposition to the displacement of 1 million indigenous people by a massive hydroelectric dam.  Due to a recent pledge by the Kenyan government to SUPPORT the dam, widespread violence across the north and a total information blackout regarding the dam and its impact, it has become clear that the event is currently neither possible nor wise. In response to the situation, we changed strategy- scaling down to maximize impact. A team of 2 filmmakers, 1 photographer and a writer are going to the Turkana province of northern Kenya to investigate and record the ongoing displacement of nearly 1 million indigenous tribesmen by the development of the GIBE 3 dam.  Our goal is to bring the story onto the world stage, using our tools as artists and journalists.  The product of this mission will be a compelling media piece to be used by any organization that opposes the destruction of some of mankind's last, functional indigenous communities along with the precious environment in which they have lived since the origin of our species.</font></h4>

In response to the situation, we changed strategy- scaling down to maximize impact. A team of 2 filmmakers, 1 photographer and a writer are going to the Turkana province of northern Kenya to investigate and record the ongoing displacement of nearly 1 million indigenous tribesmen by the development of the GIBE 3 dam.  Our goal is to bring the story onto the world stage, using our tools as artists and journalists.  The product of this mission will be a compelling media piece to be used by any organization that opposes the destruction of some of mankind's last, functional indigenous communities along with the precious environment in which they have lived since the origin of our species.
Let us first introduce ourselves. We are VILLAGE BEAT- a California-based collective of artists and activists who work to protect the rights of Kenya's indigenous tribes. Our credo: Art as action.In the spirit of fighting for a cause that matters to all of humanity, regardless of status or wealth- we are democratizing our fundraising effort. We are asking for $3 from a few thousand of you.We need you to help us protect the rights of Kenya's indigenous people. Your action will cost less than the price of a gallon of gas. A latte. An organic avocado. An hour and a half of public parking. We reason that $3 is a significant contribution that nearly everyone can make. But your involvement doesn't stop there. You are about to become part of a movement. Along with $3, we need your voice to send this message as far and wide as possible; to ask everyone you know to do the same. Born in this way, SLUMCHELLA will be our performance, you see?  We will all be on stage together, making art and demanding justice.While the posted $36,000 goal reflects our previous needs to put on two concerts, our new goal is $10,000.The funds we raise will go to:1.  Hard expenses of getting our team of 5 to Kenya. 2.  Transporting and sustaining the team during the trip from Nairobi to Lake Turkana and back. VILLAGE BEAT (click here) is a California-Registered 501(c)(3) Non-Proft Organization.All donations are tax-deductible.Our ability to cover the story and produce a compelling media piece depends entirely on reaching our new goal.In gratitude for your contribution and participation in spreading the word, you get the Calif Sessions EP (about 20 minutes of original music) recorded by Village Beat last year in Nairobi with the MCs of the Calif Records crew.  Original genge (""people's music"") heard nowhere else before.

Sitting Bull, chief of the Hunkpapa Lakota Sioux, an icon of strength and resistance, was one of the last to surrender in 1881 to the US Army, after resisting confinement to a reservation and dependence on US Indian Agency relief for over 20 years. Today, the indigenous tribes of East Africa face a similar ultimatum: surrender and abandon your land and way of life, or stay and die. In this lifetime, we have the clarity to look back on the darkest hours of our history with deep regret for the destruction and irreplaceable loss of entire cultures. In this lifetime, we can act to prevent it from happening again.  The GIBE 3 dam will be a man-made disaster that will exceed the scale of the famine we've witnessed this year in Somalia, which has led to the displacement of at least 500,000 Somalis, now living in the world's largest refugee camp, Dadaab in eastern Kenya. The relief effort has cost over $1 billion. $1 billion of life support for victims of a crisis that has already occurred. $1 billion that could have been spent on crisis prevention and the development of sustainable infrastructure.

Kenyan citizens, in the event that the GIBE 3 dam project is completed. 
 
The plan shall include: 
a.         Temporary

We are not able to respond at any occurrence, mainly because of financial problems and unfortunately our unit has temporarily quite its operation. In order to organize better, we need financial support so as to replace most of our tools and equipment, since they are already due and defective.
 
We, as unit, therefore, ask for your help to cover the cost of equipment (special rescuing tools and kits), as well as fixed operating expenses. Even one (1) euro from all of our followers and of those participate in each rescue and support our mission can make a big difference to the unit’s operational capacity and enable us to save more animals in danger.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We started Urbanized in Washington, DC in July 2017. The idea arose when we remembered the days we worked together at Starbucks during college. The daily amount of coffee thrown away in the trash made a lasting impression on us and sparked the idea to repurpose waste into useful products.</p>
<p>We first entered the market in July 2017 with three prototypes made from recycled coffee grounds: exfoliating soap, fertilizer, and wood stain and sold them at different farmers' markets. The exfoliating soaps were the bestsellers and we decided to fully focus on improving our soaps and expanded our sales channel to coffee shops. After learning from our customer interaction, we created a gift set that contains 3 travel size soaps — all-natural, no palm oil, no animal cruelty. In November 2017, we switched our full focus on e-commerce and grew our social media presence. Since then, we successfully launched our soap on Amazon and Tundra: A natural exfoliating soap made from repurposed coffee grounds which reduces the appearance of cellulite and stretch marks and helps alleviate eczema, psoriasis, and dermatitis. Our product has 70 positive reviews rated 4.5 out of 5.0 stars on Amazon. In 2018. we successfully completed the Bethesda Green accelerator program.</p>
<p>We recently established local partnerships to collect orange peels, teas, and flowers. We want you to be the first to try our cool new products before we launch them on Amazon. Your purchase will help us order the raw materials necessary to make these awesome products.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The money raised will be used to purchase two things: our uniquely designed shipping boxes and raw ingredients. That's it! It goes without saying that the more money we raise, the better prices we can get at higher volumes. <br/><br/>You would be the first backers to try our natural and eco-friendly soaps made from black tea, passion fruit tea, orange peels, rose petals, or eucalyptus leaves! </p>
<p>We normally sell our gift set for 12.95 on Amazon. If you purchase a 3-month supply, you'll receive a 35% discount, and if you purchase a 6-month supply, you'll receive a 50% discount! <br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We repurpose waste into eco-friendly products with a vision of living in a zero-waste world ?. </p>
<p>It is estimated that only 1/3 of the organic waste in landfills is recycled and the remaining 2/3s are incinerated and end up in the atmosphere as methane gas, largely contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. </p>

</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our goal is to ship the product right in time for the holiday season and we will certainly do our best to achieve this goal.

<br/><p></p>Melting glacial ice is one of the clearest indicators of
climate change. Nowhere is this more apparent than where you’d least expect to
find ice – at the equator, where 25 mountains still have a glacier. Within a
quarter of a century these glaciers will be gone due to climate change - in
some cases, far sooner. Put simply 25 mountains zero latitude, 25 years zero

<p>25zero is an adventure/environment/multimedia project with
3 key goals:</p>
<p>1.<span> 
</span><b><i>Summit to Summit </i></b></p>
<p>25zero teams will climb 6 of the 25zero mountains during the UN climate change
talks in Paris (COP21) December 2015 (a mountain in each country they are located
in). </p>
<p>The teams will transmit live images and video footage of the rapidly
disappearing glaciers from the summits of these mountains into the COP 21 conference
and to global media outlets powerfully highlighting the urgency of the issue. </p>
<p>This
is the 21<sup>st</sup> annual COP meeting and the goal is to get a meaningful,
legally binding climate change deal finally agreed. </p>
<p>Project leader Tim Jarvis is
a world-renowned adventurer and environmental scientist and will personally
climb 3 of these mountains: Carstensz Pyramid in Asia, Mount Stanley in Africa’s
Rwenzori Mountains and Chimborazo in South America. </p>
<p></p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">For those who can’t get to the mountains, the 25zero ‘virtual climb’ App means you can still get involved. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p>Climber data (including voice logs) will be captured periodically by the climbers to augment data captured and stored (including GPS coordinates, altitude, still images and video). This information will then be relayed and embedded into an App so ‘virtual climbers’ can share in the experience of climbing these mountains with Tim and his teams.</p>
<p>The App will enable users to choose the difficulty level of the mountain they want to climb. Users can also undertake their own personal challenge or race friends or colleagues. Reaching certain ‘event points’ on the mountain unlocks interesting stories, facts and footage about the mountains, the people, plants and animals that live there and what can be done about climate change.</p>
<p>Competition is invited between participants with the goal to raise money for our charity partner, WWF. The fundraising functionality directs campaign proceeds directly to WWF climate change projects and sharing of the experience via social media.</p>
<p>WWF climate change initiatives include community forestry projects, renewable energy projects and projects designed to change community behaviour amongst others.</p> Do it as a personal challenge

<p>25zero’s website,
original online content, social media program and the virtual climb App will engage
with large numbers of people not currently engaged in the issue. It will provide both useful information and interesting stories on climate change, as well as the current state of action/ inaction and crucially, what you can do to make
a difference. </p>
<p>The goal is to engage with more people and focus on solutions we
can all contribute towards rather than a message of negativity and despair.
This includes a petition, information that demystifies climate change and what
can be done about it. </p>

<p>You will take part in recording
history, helping us capture images and video of these unique glacial
environments before they melt and to record the stories of the people, plants and animals that rely on them for their
survival .</p>
<p>You will also be helping us to put pressure on global decision makers to save
us from the worst effects of climate change for the benefit of us all. We will be doing this by using
these glacier's decline as a clear visual indicator of this complex global issue.
There is momentum and the time for action is now.</p>

</div>
<h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>A lot of noise, misinformation and
media fatigue exists around the issue of climate change whilst the carbon
trajectory the world is on is the wrong one. 25zero provides an exciting,
unique way of reaching large numbers of people not engaged with the issue,
whilst influencing key global decision makers and getting kids and the public
involved via the 25zero virtual climb App. </p>
<p>In summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>25zero wants to ensure a
     legally binding climate change agreement is reached at the COP21 climate
     change talks, with various state, federal and NGO partners helping ensure
     our glacier melt images and messages are powerfully put across in support
     of this goal. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>25zero will contribute massive
     media awareness about COP21 given how newsworthy and interesting the
     project is. It influences not only those in attendance at COP21 but also
     focuses global attention on COP21 letting them know that the world is
     watching and expects a result.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Ongoing media attention around
     25zero’s climbs into 2016 and 2017 will ensure a continued sense of
     urgency about turning any agreement that is reach at COP21 into actual
     on-ground action. Ie how to deliver on any commitments made and actually
     reduce the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>25zero will raise money for WWF
     climate change projects that are making a difference. These include
     community forestry projects, renewable energy projects and projects
     designed to change community behaviour amongst others.</li> </ul>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445212985/f43m8qaj2kdfrlpz6t49.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 864.938px; height: 565px;""/></p>
<br/>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p></p>
<p>The biggest risk associated with
25zero is its not going ahead. This will not happen as 25zero has raised money
to cover the costs of teams climbing the mountains and in developing the App,
website and social media campaign. The main risk we face is that without your
help we will not get the message out as far and wide as it needs to. </p>
<p>The bigger risk is that COP21 does
not result in a meaningful climate change agreement and that climate change
continues unchecked. The world’s nations have meet once a year for 20 years and
to date not agreed on a way forward. This time must be different. </p>
<p>Compared to this, the risks associated

Melting glacial ice is one of the clearest indicators of
climate change. Nowhere is this more apparent than where you’d least expect to
find ice – at the equator, where 25 mountains still have a glacier. Within a
quarter of a century these glaciers will be gone due to climate change - in
some cases, far sooner. Put simply 25 mountains zero latitude, 25 years zero
ice – 25zero

25zero is an adventure/environment/multimedia project with
3 key goals:
1. 
Summit to Summit 
25zero teams will climb 6 of the 25zero mountains during the UN climate change
talks in Paris (COP21) December 2015 (a mountain in each country they are located
in). 
The teams will transmit live images and video footage of the rapidly
disappearing glaciers from the summits of these mountains into the COP 21 conference
and to global media outlets powerfully highlighting the urgency of the issue. 
This
is the 21st annual COP meeting and the goal is to get a meaningful,
legally binding climate change deal finally agreed. 
Project leader Tim Jarvis is
a world-renowned adventurer and environmental scientist and will personally
climb 3 of these mountains: Carstensz Pyramid in Asia, Mount Stanley in Africa’s
Rwenzori Mountains and Chimborazo in South America. 


2.  Climb it. Change.
For those who can’t get to the mountains, the 25zero ‘virtual climb’ App means you can still get involved. 

Climber data (including voice logs) will be captured periodically by the climbers to augment data captured and stored (including GPS coordinates, altitude, still images and video). This information will then be relayed and embedded into an App so ‘virtual climbers’ can share in the experience of climbing these mountains with Tim and his teams.
The App will enable users to choose the difficulty level of the mountain they want to climb. Users can also undertake their own personal challenge or race friends or colleagues. Reaching certain ‘event points’ on the mountain unlocks interesting stories, facts and footage about the mountains, the people, plants and animals that live there and what can be done about climate change.
Competition is invited between participants with the goal to raise money for our charity partner, WWF. The fundraising functionality directs campaign proceeds directly to WWF climate change projects and sharing of the experience via social media.
WWF climate change initiatives include community forestry projects, renewable energy projects and projects designed to change community behaviour amongst others. Do it as a personal challenge
or as part of a team whilst getting fit and fighting climate change. Just Climb it!




3. 
Your voice 
25zero’s website,
original online content, social media program and the virtual climb App will engage
with large numbers of people not currently engaged in the issue. It will provide both useful information and interesting stories on climate change, as well as the current state of action/ inaction and crucially, what you can do to make
a difference. 
The goal is to engage with more people and focus on solutions we
can all contribute towards rather than a message of negativity and despair.
This includes a petition, information that demystifies climate change and what
can be done about it. 



   What We Need


The cost of the climbs, including travel and logistics have
been covered, the App has been funded and the 25zero team is working on the
project pro bono. In order to create major media pressure on decision makers
and to provide WWF with the opportunity to raise more funds for their work
however we need your help. 
We
need resources to ensure the transmission of realtime images and messages from
the mountains along the equator directly to the world's leaders at COP21. This
includes:

Bandwidth to get images from
     some of the highest and most remote mountains in the world to a global
     audience

On the ground, in-country
     support

Media mobilisation and
     logistics

Some communications equipment
     costs

Messaging via mass media and
     social media platforms






What You Get
For your contribution you get to be part of a project that
focuses the attention of millions of people not currently engaged with climate
change on the issue. 
You will take part in recording
history, helping us capture images and video of these unique glacial
environments before they melt and to record the stories of the people, plants and animals that rely on them for their
survival .
You will also be helping us to put pressure on global decision makers to save
us from the worst effects of climate change for the benefit of us all. We will be doing this by using
these glacier's decline as a clear visual indicator of this complex global issue.
There is momentum and the time for action is now.
A range of 'perks' has been developed as our way of saying 'thank you' for your valuable contribution.



The Impact 
A lot of noise, misinformation and
media fatigue exists around the issue of climate change whilst the carbon
trajectory the world is on is the wrong one. 25zero provides an exciting,
unique way of reaching large numbers of people not engaged with the issue,
whilst influencing key global decision makers and getting kids and the public
involved via the 25zero virtual climb App. 
In summary:

25zero wants to ensure a
     legally binding climate change agreement is reached at the COP21 climate
     change talks, with various state, federal and NGO partners helping ensure
     our glacier melt images and messages are powerfully put across in support
     of this goal. 


25zero will contribute massive
     media awareness about COP21 given how newsworthy and interesting the
     project is. It influences not only those in attendance at COP21 but also
     focuses global attention on COP21 letting them know that the world is
     watching and expects a result.


Ongoing media attention around
     25zero’s climbs into 2016 and 2017 will ensure a continued sense of
     urgency about turning any agreement that is reach at COP21 into actual
     on-ground action. Ie how to deliver on any commitments made and actually
     reduce the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.


25zero will raise money for WWF
     climate change projects that are making a difference. These include
     community forestry projects, renewable energy projects and projects
     designed to change community behaviour amongst others. 



   Risks & Challenges 
The biggest risk associated with
25zero is its not going ahead. This will not happen as 25zero has raised money
to cover the costs of teams climbing the mountains and in developing the App,
website and social media campaign. The main risk we face is that without your
help we will not get the message out as far and wide as it needs to. 
The bigger risk is that COP21 does
not result in a meaningful climate change agreement and that climate change
continues unchecked. The world’s nations have meet once a year for 20 years and
to date not agreed on a way forward. This time must be different. 
Compared to this, the risks associated
with 25zero are minimal. Climbing mountains involves some risks but the men and
women that form the climb teams are experienced and dedicated to the cause.
They take responsibility for their actions and believe in trying to set a
positive example of what can be done, highlighting the changes that are
happening and committing to do something about it.  
Project leader Tim Jarvis has a proven
track record in delivering on what is promised and in pulling off some of the
most audacious expeditions ever undertaken. His most recent expedition was an
authentic retracing of the polar survival journey of Sir Ernest Shackleton – the original was described as ""the greatest survival journey of
all time"" by the first man to climb Mount Everest, Sir Edmund Hillary. Tim’s

From the time I can remember, I was learning things like weaving, making musical instruments, farming, dancing, hunting, fetching firewood, grazing cattle and so much more. One of the things I miss the most was the communal spirit of the people working together for the greater well being of everyone around.

I go home regularly, and I notice the changes. The villages are turning in to deserts.

</h3> <p>We Are Cove Point formed in December 2014 when a group of impacted local residents teamed up with activists from around the mid-Atlantic, determined to do everything we can to stop the construction of the massive liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal Dominion is building in the Cove Point neighborhood of Lusby, Maryland.</p>
<p>The domestic fracking industry has seen better days and is counting
 on exports to be its golden solution that increases the value of 
fracked gas and funds a massive build-out of infrastructure and new 
fracking wells. In the eastern US, the success of this export terminal 
at Cove Point is the pivot point that will either lead to a vast expanse
 of wells, pipelines, compressor stations and gas-fired power plants 
(and all of the pollution, risks and health impacts that come with these
 things), or an industry with an uncertain future that's struggling to 
stay afloat.<br/><br/>Locally, residents are suffering under 
construction that's seen this rural community on the Chesapeake Bay 
taken over by massive industrialization. Roads are often blocked by 
giant construction vehicles, there have been accidents (at the job site 
and on neighborhood streets), emissions of hazardous toxins have 
exceeded legal levels, and people are forced to deal with grimy roads, 
loud noise, heavy truck traffic, and a complicit and over-bearing police
 force while the construction continues around the clock. If this 
project is completed, 21.5 tons of pollutants would be pumped each year into the 
air of Lusby, Calvert County's biggest town. Nowhere else in the world 
does an LNG export terminal exist in as densely populated an area as 
this. More than 8,000 people live within the 2.2 mile emergency evacuation zone, a distance recommended by the Department of Energy in the case of an explosion. There are around 300 houses further down Cove Point Road, 
where their only connection to the rest of the world is the road that 
passes the terminal; for them, there is no evacuation.</p>
<p>Since the creation of We Are Cove Point, we launched a very successful Indiegogo campaign (raising nearly $22,000!) and hired an organizer with the 
money. We've done a series of direct actions, a ton of media work, and a
 whole lot of community organizing — culminating most recently in the 
largest march Southern Maryland has ever experienced for anything in its
 history.</p>
<p>In June, two prominent industry insiders spoke directly about the impact We Are Cove Point and allied groups have been having on Dominion's building of this export terminal. Dr. Bernard Weinstein, Associate Director of the Maguire Energy Institute, told a gas industry forum that he was ""real skeptical"" that the Cove Point terminal would get finished and that ""the political and environmental push back is going to be tremendous,"" citing specifically the work that ""protesters"" were doing around Cove Point. Additionally, Dominion CEO Tom Farrell, <a href=""http://www.wearecovepoint.org/dominion-ceo-worried-about-grassroots-social-media-organizing/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">speaking at a utilities conference</a>, worried that “In the hands of those who oppose the energy infrastructure, social 
media gone viral can erode industry credibility and make our job to 
communicate the facts much harder.”<br/><br/>We have an increasing amount of momentum on our side, but we're running out of money. That's why it's so important we meet our goal with this Indiegogo campaign to keep our work afloat.</p>
<p>This Cove Point LNG export terminal must be stopped — and we need your help to do it.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>At the beginning of 2015, we established a year-long $50,000 budget to hire a full-time organizer and cover things like outreach materials, office supplies, legal and administrative costs, and community events.</p>
<p>Our last Indiegogo campaign had a goal of $20,000. We raised $21,782! Between that and donations from supporters, we've raised $29,728 total in our short existence. Through mid-July, we've spent $24,133.10 in the following breakdown:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Organizer pay - $12,000</li>
<li>Legal costs - $389</li>
<li>Publicity and merchandise - $3,692.56</li>
<li>Props, banners and yard signs - $650</li>
<li>Special events - $1,220</li>
<li>Fiscal agent fees - $3,656.87</li>
<li>Funding Calvert Citizens for a Healthy Community - $2,000</li>
<li>Miscellaneous and supplies - $524.67</li>
</ul>At the time of this writing, that leaves us with $5,594.90. That should last us about two months. A lot is happening with Dominion, and we need to be moving full-speed ahead right with them. Helping us meet our goal will enable us to do the work we need to do to protect the health and well-being of people in Lusby from the risks associated with this export terminal.<br/>
</div><p> </p><h3>The Impact</h3> <p>The export terminal being built by Dominion
 in Cove Point places the local community at risk of a catastrophic 
event such as a chemical spill or explosion. Because of these risks, no LNG export terminal has ever been built in a populated area like this one — <i>anywhere in the world</i>.</p>
<p>In March 2014, there was an explosion at an LNG plant in 
Plymouth, Washington, which sent flames hundreds of feet high.  People as far as six
 miles away felt the blast, and a two-mile radius was evacuated.<br/></p>
<p>Within a two-mile radius of Dominion's plant in Cove Point there are 
2,365 homes including 19 in-home daycare centers. And 
the only emergency access to the facility is a narrow two-lane road.</p>
<p>The We Are Cove Point campaign is about more than saving the local 
community. If this export terminal is built, it will directly make fracking more profitable throughout the Marcellus and Utica shales that lie beneath Maryland, Kentucky, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia. More fracking means more families and communities that are 
exposed to its hazards. In Pennsylvania, where fracking is prevalent, 
farmers have lost their farms and families have been forced out of their
 homes because of fracking. We're also starting to see more deaths from fracking-related illnesses.<br/></p>
<p>The chemicals used in fracking — and the gases and radiation that are 
released in the process — poison water, land and air. Fracking is 
correlated with numerous health impacts. And methane leaks have made 
water undrinkable, started spontaneous house fires and add to the 
climate crisis. Fracking also causes earthquakes.</p>
<p>This export terminal would drive construction of more pipelines and 
compressor stations from Massachusetts to North Carolina. This means 
more communities would be at risk of local pollution and catastrophic 
explosions. Communities up and down the East Coast are fighting this 
expansion of fossil fuel infrastructure — and many of them have stood with us to oppose Dominion Cove Point, because they see how this one project directly enables gas projects they're fighting where they live.<br/></p>
<p>Instead of expanding fossil fuel infrastructure, we need to be 
decreasing it and moving to healthier and more sustainable sources of 
energy. Stopping this first export terminal on the East coast will send a
 strong message that other terminals will be stopped, too. </p>
<p>We can stop Dominion's terminal. Marylanders stopped one from being 
built at Sparrow's Point in 2013. New Yorkers just achieved a fracking 
ban statewide. The momentum is on our side. We can turn the tide toward
 a livable future.</p>
<p></p> <p> </p><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Our greatest 
obstacle is time because construction of the terminal has already 
started — though it started six months behind schedule, largely due to the pressure we've placed on it. The community was kept in the dark until late in the decision-making process. So far, we 
have been unsuccessful at stopping the project by appealing to 
legislators or through the courts. Still, these efforts continue. There are 
cases currently in front of courts, and there are legislators who we're working with to take action — and we're seeing progress there.</p>
<p>No matter what, we need to keep building a strong grassroots 
base and organize strategic direct action to slow the 
construction process. This will be necessary, whether we win by finally 
studying the real public safety risks and health impacts, through 
revocation of Dominion's permits, through the courts or by physically 
placing our bodies in the way.</p>
<p>There is a real potential to build on this activated grassroots foundation. 
People in the community have demonstrated great support when people have risen up and taken action. More people are interested in 
getting involved both locally and from outside the community.</p>
<p>We are holding regular conference calls and have created 
working groups to work on particular pieces of the campaign. We have a full-time organizer in the community who can help to coordinate 
the pieces and orchestrate events. This force is moving in the right direction. We just need each of you to give what you can to help us do all we can.<br/></p>

In March 2014, there was an explosion at an LNG plant in 
Plymouth, Washington, which sent flames hundreds of feet high.  People as far as six
 miles away felt the blast, and a two-mile radius was evacuated.
Within a two-mile radius of Dominion's plant in Cove Point there are 
2,365 homes including 19 in-home daycare centers. And 
the only emergency access to the facility is a narrow two-lane road.
The We Are Cove Point campaign is about more than saving the local 
community. If this export terminal is built, it will directly make fracking more profitable throughout the Marcellus and Utica shales that lie beneath Maryland, Kentucky, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia. More fracking means more families and communities that are 
exposed to its hazards. In Pennsylvania, where fracking is prevalent, 
farmers have lost their farms and families have been forced out of their
 homes because of fracking. We're also starting to see more deaths from fracking-related illnesses.
The chemicals used in fracking — and the gases and radiation that are 
released in the process — poison water, land and air. Fracking is 
correlated with numerous health impacts. And methane leaks have made 
water undrinkable, started spontaneous house fires and add to the 
climate crisis. Fracking also causes earthquakes.
This export terminal would drive construction of more pipelines and 
compressor stations from Massachusetts to North Carolina. This means 
more communities would be at risk of local pollution and catastrophic 
explosions. Communities up and down the East Coast are fighting this 
expansion of fossil fuel infrastructure — and many of them have stood with us to oppose Dominion Cove Point, because they see how this one project directly enables gas projects they're fighting where they live.
Instead of expanding fossil fuel infrastructure, we need to be 
decreasing it and moving to healthier and more sustainable sources of 
energy. Stopping this first export terminal on the East coast will send a
 strong message that other terminals will be stopped, too. 
We can stop Dominion's terminal. Marylanders stopped one from being 
built at Sparrow's Point in 2013. New Yorkers just achieved a fracking 
ban statewide. The momentum is on our side. We can turn the tide toward
 a livable future.
  Risks & Challenges Our greatest 
obstacle is time because construction of the terminal has already 
started — though it started six months behind schedule, largely due to the pressure we've placed on it. The community was kept in the dark until late in the decision-making process. So far, we 
have been unsuccessful at stopping the project by appealing to 
legislators or through the courts. Still, these efforts continue. There are 
cases currently in front of courts, and there are legislators who we're working with to take action — and we're seeing progress there.
No matter what, we need to keep building a strong grassroots 
base and organize strategic direct action to slow the 
construction process. This will be necessary, whether we win by finally 
studying the real public safety risks and health impacts, through 
revocation of Dominion's permits, through the courts or by physically 
placing our bodies in the way.
There is a real potential to build on this activated grassroots foundation. 
People in the community have demonstrated great support when people have risen up and taken action. More people are interested in 
getting involved both locally and from outside the community.
We are holding regular conference calls and have created 
working groups to work on particular pieces of the campaign. We have a full-time organizer in the community who can help to coordinate 
the pieces and orchestrate events. This force is moving in the right direction. We just need each of you to give what you can to help us do all we can.

<span>CAMPAIGN 2014:</span> Activist launches super PAC to help 'pro-climate' candidates  <span>(Thursday, December 5, 2013)</span>
</h3>
<h5>Jennifer Yachnin, <span style=""background-image: initial; color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"">E&amp;E</span> reporter</h5>
<p>When Maryland political activist Karyn Strickler determined Congress isn't pursuing climate change policy aggressively enough, she didn't sit down to write her lawmaker or contact an environmental group; she opened her own super PAC.</p>
<p>Strickler, who made her mark in the Old Line State in the late 1980s and early 1990s while working on abortion rights issues, recently founded the Vote Climate U.S. PAC to focus on the election of what she calls ""pro-climate"" candidates in competitive districts.</p>
<p>""I've worked on some of the most divisive issues of our time, so I feel prepared to take on climate change, to the extent that anyone is prepared to take on climate change,"" Strickler said.</p>
<p>A former executive director of the Endangered Species Coalition, Strickler also produced her own public access television program, called ""Climate Challenge,"" for five years.</p>
<p>""I've watched and waited for 10 years for existing groups to take political action on climate change; none of the existing groups and none of the existing politicians have succeeded,"" Strickler said.</p>
<p>But unlike some super PACs, Strickler's effort isn't backed by an independently wealthy individual.</p>
<p>While Strickler said she plans to contribute some personal funds to the project, she largely hopes to raise capital via the fundraising website <span style=""background-image: initial; color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"">IndieGogo</span>.com.</p>
<p>""I welcome all interested billionaires,"" Strickler said, then joked about California billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer, who runs the NextGen Climate Action PAC: ""If Steyer wants to pair up, I'm there.""</p>
<p>In the meantime, Strickler makes a pitch for donations in a <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/holy-h-mabel-a-project-of-vote-climate-u-s-pac"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" style=""color: rgb(17, 85, 204); text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;"" target=""_blank"">video</a> posted to the fundraising site, explaining that the PAC will use its first $25,000 to produce the first of three video ads.</p>
<p>The trio of ads, which Strickler said will be aired in competitive House races, will focus on Mable and Manny, a ""quirky couple"" who find themselves facing problems caused by extreme weather.</p>
<p>Strickler said the commercials, which will be known as ""Holy Shit Mabel!,"" were inspired when she learned of tidal flooding in Miami. She said her husband, American University history professor Allan Lichtman, turned to her and said, ""That's what I call a 'Holy Shit Mabel' moment!""</p>
<p>The fledgling PAC has not determined which races it will target in 2014, but Strickler said it's likely the ads could air in Colorado, Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, California or New York.</p>
<p>""Let's face it, the Republicans are not exactly on our side on the climate issue; even the Democrats aren't very good. That's one of the major challenges that we face,"" said Strickler, who said her goal is the implementation of a carbon tax.</p>
<p>She added that the PAC could target Senate races as well, depending on its fundraising. The <span style=""background-image: initial; color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"">IndieGogo</span> site reported the group had raised about $800 as of last night.</p>
<p>""I'm reluctant to do this,"" Strickler said. ""I don't have a lot of resources. I'm not a know-it-all on the issue, but I'm tired of waiting.""</p>

</ul></span></h3></font></span><p></p></div>","Despite the urgent alarms sounded by climate scientists, no federal climate legislation has ever become law on the federal level in the United States.  That's why we founded Vote Climate U.S. PAC to elect candidates to transition to clean, renewable, non-nuclear energy - like wind solar and geothermal - and to put a price on carbon. 
We plan to highlight the seriousness of climate change through humor.  Holy BLEEP Mable is a political ad-campaign featuring the quirky couple Mable and Manny, who find themselves in various Holy BLEEP Mabel moments as they experience weather extremes resulting from climate change.  In this first phase of our project, we'll produce 1 of 3 political ads, from concept to creation. 
Please help us bring Mabel and Manny to life and create our ads to elect candidates who can pass climate legislation.  Mabel, Manny and the rest of us here are aiming for an historic, political victory on the most critical issue of our time.Meet Mabel and Manny, our quirky couple starring in our Vote Climate U.S. PAC ads, who find themselves in various ""Holy BLEEP Mabel"" moments as they experience weather extremes related to climate change.  See below for more information on the campaign.


Meet Mabel, the Star of our TV Ads, and our Crew Mate Sean






Meet Manny the Star of our TV Ads

Join the 2,900 members of our Vote Climate U.S. PAC/Climate Challenge Facebook page.  Please take a look at our video linked above, for more information on our campaign.






What We Need
No donation is too small or too large.  Please donate $1, $5, $10, $25 $50, $100, whatever you can afford.  We'll appreciate any amount you give and put it to good use, fueling the momentum of our campaign.  If we meet our goal of $3,000, it will go toward our ads, allowing us to pay for a director, co-producer, writer and lighting director for the production of our ads.  As supporters of the concept and the campaign, they are giving us an extraordinarily great price.
We'll use your donation to:

Pay our professional production team - Andy, Ross, Sam and the Crew
Write and refine the scripts
Cast and direct the actors
Shoot the ads




The Producers - Andy & Ross Setting-up the Ad Shoot
If we do not reach our goal, we will use whatever we raise to make the first ad, but let's not consider failure, let's get it done!  If we exceed our goal, your donation will help pay for editing the ad and getting it ready for placement.  Here's hoping for success beyond our wildest dreams.


The Impact
Our unique and simple approach is to make a series of 3-ads, designed to run in targeted congressional districts to change the political dynamics on climate change.  If we succeed, we will make history, we will change history.  But for now, let's stay focused on the first step - making the first ad.

CAMPAIGN 2014: Activist launches super PAC to help 'pro-climate' candidates  (Thursday, December 5, 2013)

Jennifer Yachnin, E&E reporter
When Maryland political activist Karyn Strickler determined Congress isn't pursuing climate change policy aggressively enough, she didn't sit down to write her lawmaker or contact an environmental group; she opened her own super PAC.
Strickler, who made her mark in the Old Line State in the late 1980s and early 1990s while working on abortion rights issues, recently founded the Vote Climate U.S. PAC to focus on the election of what she calls ""pro-climate"" candidates in competitive districts.
""I've worked on some of the most divisive issues of our time, so I feel prepared to take on climate change, to the extent that anyone is prepared to take on climate change,"" Strickler said.
A former executive director of the Endangered Species Coalition, Strickler also produced her own public access television program, called ""Climate Challenge,"" for five years.
""I've watched and waited for 10 years for existing groups to take political action on climate change; none of the existing groups and none of the existing politicians have succeeded,"" Strickler said.
But unlike some super PACs, Strickler's effort isn't backed by an independently wealthy individual.
While Strickler said she plans to contribute some personal funds to the project, she largely hopes to raise capital via the fundraising website IndieGogo.com.
""I welcome all interested billionaires,"" Strickler said, then joked about California billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer, who runs the NextGen Climate Action PAC: ""If Steyer wants to pair up, I'm there.""
In the meantime, Strickler makes a pitch for donations in a video posted to the fundraising site, explaining that the PAC will use its first $25,000 to produce the first of three video ads.
The trio of ads, which Strickler said will be aired in competitive House races, will focus on Mable and Manny, a ""quirky couple"" who find themselves facing problems caused by extreme weather.
Strickler said the commercials, which will be known as ""Holy Shit Mabel!,"" were inspired when she learned of tidal flooding in Miami. She said her husband, American University history professor Allan Lichtman, turned to her and said, ""That's what I call a 'Holy Shit Mabel' moment!""
The fledgling PAC has not determined which races it will target in 2014, but Strickler said it's likely the ads could air in Colorado, Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, California or New York.
""Let's face it, the Republicans are not exactly on our side on the climate issue; even the Democrats aren't very good. That's one of the major challenges that we face,"" said Strickler, who said her goal is the implementation of a carbon tax.
She added that the PAC could target Senate races as well, depending on its fundraising. The IndieGogo site reported the group had raised about $800 as of last night.
""I'm reluctant to do this,"" Strickler said. ""I don't have a lot of resources. I'm not a know-it-all on the issue, but I'm tired of waiting.""

<p><strong> Saving the World with Renewable Energy<br/></strong></p>
<p>In memory of my father, Cahill Maloney (1959 - 2012), I am asking for your help completing the prototype for his discovery and invention, <strong><em>nautical torque. </em></strong>This original, patented process for generating renewable electricity utilizes the slow and steady movement of large ships and vessels as they rise and fall with the tides. Because the process is easily scalable to utility levels and results in consistent output, it presents <strong>the first viable renewable alternative to fossil fuel and nuclear based power production.</strong> <a href=""#NT"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Read the story of Nautical Torque</a> or visit <a href=""http://www.nauticaltorquetechnology.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nautical Torque Technology</a> for details about the company, our business strategy and management team.</p>
<p><strong>Fulfilling a Blue Collar Worker’s Last Wish<br/></strong>Cahill lived a hard and humble life, but always had big ideas, inventions, and dreams. He lived and thought outside the mainstream, making a living as a sign painter, and developing an assortment of inventions. <strong>All of his inventions were aimed at making life better for people and better for the planet.</strong> Nautical torque was his last, biggest, and most ambitious project, and he dedicated the last years of his life to this idea; continuing to work on it despite countless rejections, homelessness and a stage IV stomach cancer diagnosis.  He learned of the cancer in mid October of 2012, and a month later breathed his final breath before realizing his dream. Telling his story, raising money for the prototype, and bringing nautical torque to the world will honor his life and hard work.  <a href=""#CM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Read more about Cahill's story</a></p>
<p><strong>Use of Funds<br/></strong>All funds will purchase specific pieces that will result in a full scale landlocked prototype, which will simulate the ship and tidal movement, and provide evidence and data that will spur further investment and lead to construction of larger seaside prototypes.  This will culminate in the commercialization of nautical torque as an electricity production process that can eliminate the need for nuclear and fossil fuel power production.  <strong> <br/></strong> <a href=""#funds"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Read more about use of funds.</a></p>

<p><strong>The Story of Nautical Torque</strong></p>
<p><img alt=""container ship"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/618508/pictures/full/20130115103248-oakland-bay-bridge-san-francisco-casfbyb.jpg?1358274775"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin: 5px;""/>If you live in San Francisco, you may have noticed the large boats gliding under the Golden Gate bridge, heading to the Port of Oakland to unload their cargos. One spring day in 2008, Cahill sat and watched these ships as he waited for the paint to dry on one of his signs.  Though imperceptible to the naked eye, he realized that each ship must move up (as the tide comes in) and down (as the tide goes out). From years of experience working on cars and building boats, he immediately grasped that the movement of this massive amount of weight, even if only a few feet, generated an incredible of torque.  The tide provided a free reload of each ship, and the weight of the ship could be harnessed to generate electricity.</p>
<p><img alt=""sketch of seaside application of nautical torque"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/617630/pictures/full/20130114181444-render_3.jpg?1358216089"" src="""" style=""margin: 2px; float: right;""/>Attached to the stationary platform, the rise and fall of these ships creates an irresistible force that can drive a gearbox, and result in the spinning of a turbine, and hence, electricity.  While this “lunar” energy relies on the tides to lift the vessels, it differs from tidal, hydro and wave power in that they  use the actual force of water to spin tubrines.  Nautical Torque uses the lifting capacity of water to lift Mass, and the force of the falling mass actually spins the turbine.  Because the tides, governed by the moon, are constant and predictable, the gearing system can be designed for continous power production, and address the intermittency problem of existing renewables. Because bulk energy storage is very limited and society demands 24 hr power, intermittent renewables such as solar and wind must be backed up by coal, nuclear or hydro.  This dirty power, which continues to be developed to meet growing energy demand, is called ""baseload"" because it is always on and provides predictable, scalable and consistent energy.  Renewables cannot entirely replace these consistent, yet dirty,  baseload sources.   </p>

<p>A baseload renewable that can be scaled up to utility levels, and provide affordable and consistent high density power to the grid is the holy grail of the energy world because it means we can truly end our dependence on fossil fuel and nuclear based power generation. </p>
<p>Convinced that nautical torque could meet the world's growing demand for energy, my father and I formed Nautical Torque Technology and filed a patent.  While I developed the business plan and website, he pitched the idea to everyone from NASA to PG&amp;E to venture capitalists, hoping to sell them on the idea alond.  But he soon realized a proof of concept was needed to convince funders.  He attacked this challenging task and spent four years researching and building various models - piecing together information from a variety of industries:  construction, engineering, hydraulics, air compression, shipping, and electric.  On a shoestring budget, and with the help of his friend and research partner, Peter Collins, he finally completed an advanced proof of concept that used gearboxes, air compression and floating weights to simulate the tides and vessels.  This herculean effort used up the last of our money but was able to demonstrate the basic principle; a large particle of slow moving mass generates more electricity than anyone has imagined.   </p>
<p>At this point, we entered the 2012 Clean Tech Open, making it to the semi-final round even though we still lacked a full scale prototype and were considered very “early stage”.  The Clean Tech Open provided invaluable mentorship and strategic contacts that turned our big idea into a solid business strategy.  It also allowed my dad to exhibit his model at the technology fairs, where it garnered plenty of attention.  However, venture capitalists told us we were too early stage while angel funders said we were asking for too little.  Plus, everyone still wanted to see a fullscale prototype, not just a proof of concept. We needed a fullscale prototype that could be verified and tested by 3rd parties, before they would invest.  But our finances were stretched to the limit at this point, and we needed $15,000 to buy the final parts to complete the prototype.  It was extremely frustrating because we had come so far but funding remained elusive for the last half of 2012.  My dad grew frustrated while I continued to preach patience.  We just needed to refine our pitch videos, work on our business plan and go through all the hoops of the startup game.  We were “fishing”, I told him, for that one enlightened investor, who could see the big picture.  The idea was too good.  The need was too great.  And we just needed to persevere.  But time was not on his side. </p>

<p>A major change occurred with the death of his mother in 1997, followed by the death of his sister a year later. Although he never talked about it, their deaths impacted him greatly and inspired him to give up drinking and the bar life to which he had grown accustomed.  Their deaths caused a great awakening, and he simplified his life.  Living out of a $600 a month room, he focused on playing golf and creative endeavors, such as designs for mattresses that would prevent bed sores and a single breath breathing device for big wave surfers and lifeboats. This thought pattern eventually led to his discovery of nautical torque.   <br/><br/> Unfortunately, the energy he put into constructing the proof of concepts took him away from painting signs, and he fell behind in rent.  Forced to abandon his single room hotel, he settled into his van and lived out of it for the last two years.  Although he was homeless and broke, he never faltered in his belief that nautical torque would change the world, and felt we were just on the verge of a breakthrough.  He believed all the struggle was worth it if nautical torque could succeed and make a difference in the world.  His ingenuity and creativity took him right up to the finish line but not across it. </p>
<p><strong>A Difficult Ending</strong></p>
<p>Starting in September, my father began suffering stomach problems, which impaired his ability to hold down food.  Uninsured people tend to resist going to the hospital.  Plus, we assumed it was just a side effect of giving up chewing tobacco after 30 years.  But the pain persisted and grew worse.  In mid-October, he went to the community clinic for an appointment, and they immediately sent him over to SF General for a CAT scan.  They saw the tumor right away and diagnosed him with late stage esophageal/stomach cancer with a predicted survival time of six months.  Although the news shocked us both, my father refused to give up and maintained a hopeful attitude that he could beat it with healthy eating and exercise; that he needed to beat it in order to see nautical torque through to completion.  However, he lost all of his weight as the tumor closed the opening to his stomach. Still, he never gave up; making his walks up and down the hospital hallways, and telling the plethora of doctors and nurses that he had invented a new type of renewable energy.  He even checked himself out of the hospital to attend a meeting with an engineer in order to show and explain the proof of concept. </p>

 Saving the World with Renewable Energy
In memory of my father, Cahill Maloney (1959 - 2012), I am asking for your help completing the prototype for his discovery and invention, nautical torque. This original, patented process for generating renewable electricity utilizes the slow and steady movement of large ships and vessels as they rise and fall with the tides. Because the process is easily scalable to utility levels and results in consistent output, it presents the first viable renewable alternative to fossil fuel and nuclear based power production. Read the story of Nautical Torque or visit Nautical Torque Technology for details about the company, our business strategy and management team.
Fulfilling a Blue Collar Worker’s Last WishCahill lived a hard and humble life, but always had big ideas, inventions, and dreams. He lived and thought outside the mainstream, making a living as a sign painter, and developing an assortment of inventions. All of his inventions were aimed at making life better for people and better for the planet. Nautical torque was his last, biggest, and most ambitious project, and he dedicated the last years of his life to this idea; continuing to work on it despite countless rejections, homelessness and a stage IV stomach cancer diagnosis.  He learned of the cancer in mid October of 2012, and a month later breathed his final breath before realizing his dream. Telling his story, raising money for the prototype, and bringing nautical torque to the world will honor his life and hard work.  Read more about Cahill's story
Use of FundsAll funds will purchase specific pieces that will result in a full scale landlocked prototype, which will simulate the ship and tidal movement, and provide evidence and data that will spur further investment and lead to construction of larger seaside prototypes.  This will culminate in the commercialization of nautical torque as an electricity production process that can eliminate the need for nuclear and fossil fuel power production.    Read more about use of funds.

The Story of Nautical Torque
If you live in San Francisco, you may have noticed the large boats gliding under the Golden Gate bridge, heading to the Port of Oakland to unload their cargos. One spring day in 2008, Cahill sat and watched these ships as he waited for the paint to dry on one of his signs.  Though imperceptible to the naked eye, he realized that each ship must move up (as the tide comes in) and down (as the tide goes out). From years of experience working on cars and building boats, he immediately grasped that the movement of this massive amount of weight, even if only a few feet, generated an incredible of torque.  The tide provided a free reload of each ship, and the weight of the ship could be harnessed to generate electricity.
Attached to the stationary platform, the rise and fall of these ships creates an irresistible force that can drive a gearbox, and result in the spinning of a turbine, and hence, electricity.  While this “lunar” energy relies on the tides to lift the vessels, it differs from tidal, hydro and wave power in that they  use the actual force of water to spin tubrines.  Nautical Torque uses the lifting capacity of water to lift Mass, and the force of the falling mass actually spins the turbine.  Because the tides, governed by the moon, are constant and predictable, the gearing system can be designed for continous power production, and address the intermittency problem of existing renewables. Because bulk energy storage is very limited and society demands 24 hr power, intermittent renewables such as solar and wind must be backed up by coal, nuclear or hydro.  This dirty power, which continues to be developed to meet growing energy demand, is called ""baseload"" because it is always on and provides predictable, scalable and consistent energy.  Renewables cannot entirely replace these consistent, yet dirty,  baseload sources.   

A baseload renewable that can be scaled up to utility levels, and provide affordable and consistent high density power to the grid is the holy grail of the energy world because it means we can truly end our dependence on fossil fuel and nuclear based power generation. 
Convinced that nautical torque could meet the world's growing demand for energy, my father and I formed Nautical Torque Technology and filed a patent.  While I developed the business plan and website, he pitched the idea to everyone from NASA to PG&E to venture capitalists, hoping to sell them on the idea alond.  But he soon realized a proof of concept was needed to convince funders.  He attacked this challenging task and spent four years researching and building various models - piecing together information from a variety of industries:  construction, engineering, hydraulics, air compression, shipping, and electric.  On a shoestring budget, and with the help of his friend and research partner, Peter Collins, he finally completed an advanced proof of concept that used gearboxes, air compression and floating weights to simulate the tides and vessels.  This herculean effort used up the last of our money but was able to demonstrate the basic principle; a large particle of slow moving mass generates more electricity than anyone has imagined.   
At this point, we entered the 2012 Clean Tech Open, making it to the semi-final round even though we still lacked a full scale prototype and were considered very “early stage”.  The Clean Tech Open provided invaluable mentorship and strategic contacts that turned our big idea into a solid business strategy.  It also allowed my dad to exhibit his model at the technology fairs, where it garnered plenty of attention.  However, venture capitalists told us we were too early stage while angel funders said we were asking for too little.  Plus, everyone still wanted to see a fullscale prototype, not just a proof of concept.

<h3><strong>Summary </strong></h3>
<p>On April 20<sup>th</sup>, 2013, a devastating earthquake struck rural Sichuan Province near the city Ya’an. One of the two hardest hit counties was Baoxing County, home of the Fengtongzhai Honey Cooperative. Our project goal is to crowdfund the money for 100 beehives to rebuild and expand the honey cooperative. This project will help the community start down the path to recovery, while preserving the local ecosystem that is crucial to the giant panda.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Background</strong></h3>
<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baoxing_County"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Baoxing County</a> and the surrounding area is a biodiversity hotspot of global significance. It is home to multiple endangered species, including the giant panda and snub-nosed golden monkey. Since 2005, our nonprofit the <a href=""http://www.geichina.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Global Environmental Institute</a> (GEI) has worked extensively with the Baoxing County community and officials from the Fengtongzhai Nature Reserve to build up and promote the local honey industry. In addition to this region being especially suitable for beekeeping because of its proximity to the nature reserve, honey production enables the rural population to improve their livelihood in a way that protects the surrounding fragile environment, by providing an alternative to illegal forestry.</p>
<p>Led by our crowdfunding team member Aimin Wang, GEI helped to build up the local honey industry in multiple ways.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Built up beekeeping capacity. Now, the cooperative is experienced enough that they can train new beekeepers within the community themselves.</li>
<li>Registered the beekeepers as the “Fengtongzhai Green Source Specialized Cooperative”, a tax-free status similar to farmers cooperative statuses in other countries (“Fengtongzhai Honey Cooperative” for short).</li>
<li>Facilitated meetings between the cooperative and regional organic food business to help them market their honey.</li>
<li>Bought beehives for rural families to help build the industry.   </li>
</ul><p>But progress was not without setbacks. Baoxing County suffered significant loss during the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. Three people in the county were killed, 338 were injured, and 15,390 buildings were destroyed. The financial losses totalled 1.7 billion RMB. GEI assisted during the 2008 earthquake recovery effort by helping to rebuild the cooperative’s beekeeping base and replacing the 30 beehives destroyed during landslides. Unfortunately, the damage from the April 20<sup>th</sup>, 2013, earthquake is significantly greater. The full extent of the damage is still unknown. </p>
<p>With this campaign, we are crowdfunding the money to purchase beehives for families affected by the earthquake. If we reach our Indiegogo goal of $10,000, we will have enough money to purchase around 100 beehives for the Fengtongzhai Honey Cooperative, which will help put the community on the path towards recovery. </p>

<h3><strong> </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>How will this project help Baoxing County?</strong></h3>
<p>This work is intertwined with many facets of the earthquake recovery, including the economy, environment, and culture.</p>
<ul>
<li>Help beekeepers recover their losses. Many families lost beehives during landslides resulting from the earthquake. Our first goal is to replace those beehives to rebuild the cooperative.</li>
<li>Expand the cooperative to include more rural families. Based on current information, landslides have significantly damaged farmland. Therefore, beekeeping will be one of the best ways for the rural residents to earn an income this year. Each beehive can produce about 10-15 kilos of honey per beehive each year, which is equivalent to a total additional income of 1,200-1,800 RMB. </li>
<li>Conserve the Fengtongzhai National Natural Protected Area, where giant pandas still live in the wild. Beekeeping provides the community with an alternative way to earn money, so that they do not need to go into the nature reserve to illegally source forestry material to earn a living.  </li>
<li>Increase the local population of bees and their important role as pollinators for local plant life. The population of pollinators in China, like in many regions across the globe, is drastically declining, severely threatening both food production and natural ecosystems.</li>
<li>Help vulnerable groups, including women, children, and the elderly, by developing a non-labor intensive way to earn money. (and with proper training, it will be non-sting intensive)</li>
</ul><p>Rebuilding and expanding the honey industry in rural Sichuan allows them to recover and develop in a way that is environmentally, socially, and economically sustainable. </p>

Summary 
On April 20th, 2013, a devastating earthquake struck rural Sichuan Province near the city Ya’an. One of the two hardest hit counties was Baoxing County, home of the Fengtongzhai Honey Cooperative. Our project goal is to crowdfund the money for 100 beehives to rebuild and expand the honey cooperative. This project will help the community start down the path to recovery, while preserving the local ecosystem that is crucial to the giant panda.

Background
Baoxing County and the surrounding area is a biodiversity hotspot of global significance. It is home to multiple endangered species, including the giant panda and snub-nosed golden monkey. Since 2005, our nonprofit the Global Environmental Institute (GEI) has worked extensively with the Baoxing County community and officials from the Fengtongzhai Nature Reserve to build up and promote the local honey industry. In addition to this region being especially suitable for beekeeping because of its proximity to the nature reserve, honey production enables the rural population to improve their livelihood in a way that protects the surrounding fragile environment, by providing an alternative to illegal forestry.
Led by our crowdfunding team member Aimin Wang, GEI helped to build up the local honey industry in multiple ways.  

Built up beekeeping capacity. Now, the cooperative is experienced enough that they can train new beekeepers within the community themselves.
Registered the beekeepers as the “Fengtongzhai Green Source Specialized Cooperative”, a tax-free status similar to farmers cooperative statuses in other countries (“Fengtongzhai Honey Cooperative” for short).
Facilitated meetings between the cooperative and regional organic food business to help them market their honey.
Bought beehives for rural families to help build the industry.   
But progress was not without setbacks. Baoxing County suffered significant loss during the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. Three people in the county were killed, 338 were injured, and 15,390 buildings were destroyed. The financial losses totalled 1.7 billion RMB. GEI assisted during the 2008 earthquake recovery effort by helping to rebuild the cooperative’s beekeeping base and replacing the 30 beehives destroyed during landslides. Unfortunately, the damage from the April 20th, 2013, earthquake is significantly greater. The full extent of the damage is still unknown. 
With this campaign, we are crowdfunding the money to purchase beehives for families affected by the earthquake. If we reach our Indiegogo goal of $10,000, we will have enough money to purchase around 100 beehives for the Fengtongzhai Honey Cooperative, which will help put the community on the path towards recovery.

How will this project help Baoxing County?
This work is intertwined with many facets of the earthquake recovery, including the economy, environment, and culture.

Help beekeepers recover their losses. Many families lost beehives during landslides resulting from the earthquake. Our first goal is to replace those beehives to rebuild the cooperative.
Expand the cooperative to include more rural families. Based on current information, landslides have significantly damaged farmland. Therefore, beekeeping will be one of the best ways for the rural residents to earn an income this year. Each beehive can produce about 10-15 kilos of honey per beehive each year, which is equivalent to a total additional income of 1,200-1,800 RMB. 
Conserve the Fengtongzhai National Natural Protected Area, where giant pandas still live in the wild. Beekeeping provides the community with an alternative way to earn money, so that they do not need to go into the nature reserve to illegally source forestry material to earn a living.  
Increase the local population of bees and their important role as pollinators for local plant life. The population of pollinators in China, like in many regions across the globe, is drastically declining, severely threatening both food production and natural ecosystems.
Help vulnerable groups, including women, children, and the elderly, by developing a non-labor intensive way to earn money. (and with proper training, it will be non-sting intensive)
Rebuilding and expanding the honey industry in rural Sichuan allows them to recover and develop in a way that is environmentally, socially, and economically sustainable.

Budget
All of the crowdfunded money goes toward purchasing beehives and rewards.

The cost of beehives depends on timing. Since we’ll be buying the beehives at the end of May, each one will cost approximately 300 RMB (around $50)
Each beehive has a delivery cost of around 15 RMB (around $2.50)
We designed the rewards so that around 50% of the money you give goes directly to the beehive purchase, and the remaining money goes to costs and shipping for the rewards and crowdfunding fees. 
To ensure transparency, we will share all receipts and expenses by updating the campaign website. 
 
Timeline
April 26 – May 31: Crowdfunding. We are sharing the project with as many people as we can to build support for the recovery effort. Please help us get the word out by sharing it with your networks!  
May 31 – July 31: Buy and deliver beehives to Baoxing County families, assist with new beekeeper training, and fulfill all of the awesome crowdfunding rewards.
 
Who are we?

Caption: Aimee, Wang Aimin, and Tom at the GEI office in Chaoyangmen District, Beijing, China 
We are three people from the Global Environmental Institute, an environmental nonprofit based in Beijing, China.


Aimin Wang, GEI Program Officer: Aimin has led GEI’s work with the Baoxing County community since the partnership began in 2005. Aimin organizes and leads our collaboration with the local reserve officials, the cooperative, and the community for all aspects of the project.

Tom Brett, GEI Communications Officer: Tom hails from Tulsa, Oklahoma. He first came to China when he was 16 to live with a host family for a year. Since then, he has lived in China on and off for nearly four years working and volunteering with environmental NGOs, including The Nature Conservancy and GEI. Tom is co-managing the campaign with Aimee.

Aimee Bailey, GEI Fellow: Aimee is a physicist by training, who has since focused her efforts on sustainable development. She is at GEI for the year researching and writing a research paper called “Crowdfunding Sustainable Development in China”.  Aimee is co-managing the campaign with Tom.
If we are successfully funded, Aimin will direct everything we are doing on the ground to implement the project, including delivering beehives and facilitating new beekeeper training.  Tom and Aimee will assist Aimin with project implementation, manage the budget, and make sure all of our awesome crowdfunding rewards are fulfilled.   

 
Thank you
Thank you for visiting our campaign! We appreciate all of your support for Baoxing County and the Fengtongzhai Honey Cooperative, including thoughts, words of encouragement, help spreading the word about the project, and money if you are able to participate. If you have any questions about the project, please do not hesitate to contact us.
This project would also not be possible without the support of our nonprofit, GEI. GEI paid for the expenses to produce our campaign video. GEI will also pay for our visit to Baoxing County in June to implement the project, if our campaign is successful.  Thank you GEI!

The Project
Funky Junk, an amazing social enterprise based in Cambodia, has partnered with Hipcycle, the web's leading source of upcycled products, to begin distributing their product line in North America. With your help, we can launch this beautiful, durable, and functional eco-product line and also tell the inspiring Fuinky Junk story to a North American audience.

CVR is an organization in Eatontown, NJ that does really great work by providing employment and job readiness training to people with disabilities.
The Funky Junk Story
In developing countries, where garbage collection services are minimal and environmental awareness takes second place to basic survival, plastic bags are everywhere: clogging drains, choking animals, and blighting already difficult lives.
So Funky Junk decided to do something about it.
Funky Junk Recycled is an innovative social enterprise – making beautiful, functional, long-lasting items in Cambodia from used plastic bags reclaimed from streets and fields.
Supporting Funky Junk means contributing to a cleaner environment and providing fair trade income, training and community benefits for its local producers. 
Funky Junk Recycled spent a number of years designing and implementing its processes and products with the aim of providing sustainable income for a group of local people without a major investment in technology, equipment or capacity building.
By creating a self-sustaining enterprise, they use business best practices as a means of improving peoples’ living environment, while helping them to gain a source of income and a sense of self-worth.
The community groups Funky Junk works with are carefully selected to ensure that they are capable of self-management after a training and implementation period. A local project manager is backed by the Funky Junk co-operative board, made up of a team of voluntary advisors with business and NGO backgrounds.
Fair trade experts ensure that the business model follows international best practices and creates a harmonious environment where hard work and initiative is rewarded.
All products are made from discarded plastic bags, collected by trash pickers from the towns and countryside, and delivered to the Funky Junk center. Here they are washed, disinfected and dried in the sun before being sorted by color. The bags are cut and made into yarn, which is then crocheted into our fabulous product line.


What We Need & What You Get
We are seeking to raise $20,000 to get this project off the ground:

$4,000 for a new e-commerce website which will be located at funkyjunkrecycled.us. This will become the portal for wholesale distribution of Funky Junk in North America.
$3,500 for booth space and expenses at the New York International Gift Fair, where these products will be formally introduced in August 2012.

<p>The nature of environmental activism is changing. It’s not enough anymore to provide information about environmental causes to the public. To truly promote action we need to actively resonate with the public on an emotional and intellectual level. It’s easy for environmentally­ concerned citizens to find information about causes and issues they support or actions they can take to do their part. The difficult part is getting citizens<br/>to care about environmental issues in the first place. To that end, the creation and distribution of video content is a powerful tool.</p>

<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p>Well who are we to talk about this? Save Barnegat Bay has been a strong champion of Barnegat Bay's cause since 1971. All of us here feel that Barnegat Bay has been an important part of our lives, whether by being the backdrop to our childhood memories, a place for introspection, or as a crucial part of the ecosystem we all enjoy.</p>
<p>Save Barnegat Bay as an organization works tirelessly to promote awareness of Bay-centric issues, push for Bay-friendly legislation, and fund student environmental research projects in the Bay's ecosystem. </p>
<h3>What we need! </h3>
<p>Video production is complicated! And the fact of the matter is, Save Barnegat Bay is not in a position technologically to accomplish our video-content goals. We certainly have the drive, the motivation, and the talent, but without cameras, sound equipment, or editing software there's not much we can do!</p>
<p>If you donate, your money will go towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new camera, tripod, and related equipment</li>
<li>Sound recording equipment</li>
<li>Editing hard- and software</li>
<li>Miscellaneous production-related expenses (gas, coffee, permits, and if we raise enough a small professional crew)</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
This spring five adventurers will be taking wetlands restoration to the next level. Over the course of a month, they will circumnavigate the shores of Lake Pontchartrain on a large pontoon raft made using salvaged and recycled building materials in order to document, and help to restore, areas of severe land loss. The five will be getting dirty and planting thousands of plugs of native marsh grasses and cypress trees grown at the Common Ground Relief Wetlands Restoration Station all along the way. The filming of the condition of the lake, the restoration efforts, as well as life on the raft; will, with media coverage and Common Ground Relief's local and national network of support, inspire and educate thousands of people about the severe environmental issues that face Louisiana and the nation . Common Ground Relief and the crew will contact research universities to offer assistance in data collection for research relating to wetlands loss and degradation. By traveling slowly on a simple raft, getting wet and muddy, eating seafood from the lake, and raising both awareness and the health of the wetlands, this project will be an adventure with a purpose.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This December We will be doing a mini-trip, to ""test the waters"" so to speak.  It'll be cold, we'll have fewer crew members, and we wont have sponsors.  But once this boat is finished there's no way you can keep me off it, i'm putting it in the water right away!</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
We need cash to buy boat building materials, and supplies for the trip.  We need equipment like tents, water filters, camping stoves, etc. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>We also need film equipment.  The more we get the more legit we can make it, but at the very least we need a video camera with a waterproof case.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>For people who donate $25 or more we will mail over a signed copy of our DVD.  For the adventourous few who throgh down $150 we invite you to a home cooked dinner ON THE BOAT.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This project is in partnership with Common Ground Relief, and all fundraising is being done with them.  CGR is a 501c3 so all donations are tax deductable.</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't give cash, perhaps you could donate some used camping equipment.  But other than that the best way to help support the wetlands of coastal louisiana is by pressuring our government adgencies, such as the Army Corps of Engineers, to make responsible decisions that support a healthy wetland ecosystem.</p>

<h2>A Big Thank You</h2>
<h3>Thanks to everyone who contributed to our project in Phase I.  Your contribution is greatly appreciated and has helped us get one step closer to a new Holocaust museum in Danville, Iowa.  Phase II has been launched to raise the needed funds to start the preparation of the land for the building of the museum.</h3>

<h2> Anne Frank's Iowa Connection</h2>

<p><strong><em>Oceans Apart</em></strong> was written and illustrated by two teenage girls from Burlington, Iowa.  A copy of their work is a wonderful perk for our campaign.</p>
<h3>The Wagner sisters in the corn fields of Iowa were pen pals with the Frank sisters ... </h3>
<p>Just before the Frank family went into hiding, Anne and her older sister Margot were writing letters back and forth between two sisters in Danville, Iowa named Juanita and Betty Ann Wagner.  </p>
<p>The pen pal project started in Juanita's classroom when teacher Birdie Mathews asked if students would be interested in writing to children abroad.  Juanita drew the name of young Anne Frank and immediately wrote to her at an address in Amsterdam.  Juanita's and Anne's older sisters began to write one another as well.  </p>
<p>Anne was an avid postcard collector and sent her new friend in Iowa a postcard from Amsterdam telling about her hobby.  In a letter from Anne to Juanita she tells of looking at a map of Iowa but not finding Danville.  Anne asked Juanita if it was close to the city of Burlington.  </p>
<p>Then the Nazis invaded and the letters stopped.  The Wagner sisters had no idea the Frank sisters were Jewish but knew they were suffering in the war.  Many years later Betty Ann wrote to Margot asking if her family was all right.  It was then Otto Frank who responded letting Betty Ann know his wife and daughters died in a concentration camp.</p>
<p>Today these precious letters from Anne, Margot and Otto, are at the Simon Wiesenthal Center (a museum focused on racism and the history of the Holocaust) in Los Angeles, California.</p>
<p>Back in Danville there is a very humble museum where school children and visitors can come and learn about Birdie Mathew's pen pal project.  Copies of these very important letters are in Danville, Iowa.  It really amazes children to know the young (now very famous) author of a diary found a place in the heart of a little girl from hometown Iowa. </p>

<h3><strong>What We Need ...</strong></h3>

<p>A new educational facility is desperately needed to share this amazing part of history for school children and adults alike.  The local fundraising has begun with a significant amount raised which will allow us to purchase the property adjoining the current museum.  We are in the final stages of this sale so soon we will have room to build.</p>
<p>Our goal is to expand the current facility with a building project estimated to cost $2,000,000.  Therefore we are launching the fundraising on this site hoping to raise the first $100,000 -- or more!</p>
<p>Once the building project is complete, it will serve as a museum, educational center and library.</p>

<p>(Wetumpka, Alabama) August 9, 2012 – The Muscogee (Creek) Nation demands a halt to construction of the “Creek Casino Wetumpka” expansion project, which is desecrating the sacred Hickory Ground.  The Poarch Band of Creek Indians already excavated approximately 60 human remains to build the casino, and the recently announced $246 million expansion will cause further desecration to Hickory Ground.</p>
<p>“The Muscogee (Creek) Nation is committed to protecting the burial and ceremonial grounds of our ancestors,” said Principal Chief George Tiger.  “We have attempted to convey to the Poarch Band why it is wrong to disturb the peace of our ancestors and burial grounds.  However, the Poarch Band does not seem to share our cultural values and respect our traditional ways.”</p>
<p>Hickory Ground, known as “Oce Vpofv” in the Muscogee language, was the last Capitol of the National Council of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation, prior to forced removal to Indian Territory in the 1830s.  The sacred place includes a ceremonial ground, a tribal burial ground and individual graves. </p>
<p>Hickory Ground was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.  In 1984, the federal government officially recognized the Poarch Band of Creek Indians, descendants of Muscogee (Creeks) who were not removed and did not live in Alabama as Muscogee Creeks.  The Alabama Historical Commission transferred Hickory Ground to the Poarch Band, even though they had no direct ancestral or cultural connection to the ceremonial ground.</p>
<p>Although the Poarch Band promised to preserve the Hickory Ground for the benefit of all Creek Indians, the Poarch Band exhumed Muscogee human remains and ceremonial objects to build the Creek Casino Wetumpka, with assistance from researchers at Auburn University.  The excavated human remains belong to the lineal ancestors of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation in Oklahoma, who hold Hickory Ground as sacred and oppose development on the ceremonial ground.</p>
<p>“The desecration of a tribal grave, burial or ceremonial place is a human rights violation,” says attorney Brendan Ludwick, who represents the Muscogee (Creek) Peoples in Oklahoma opposing the development.</p>
<p>Mekko George Thompson, who has served as a traditional Chief of the Oce Vpofa Muscogee Creeks in Oklahoma for 42 years, said, “Our ancestors and their burial objects, and our cultural items need to be returned where they were taken from, and the whole place needs to go back to nature.” </p>
<p>The Muscogee (Creek) Nation is a federally recognized Indian tribe based near Okmulgee Oklahoma.  The Oce Vpofv Muscogee (Creeks) were forcibly removed from their historic, ceremonial and ancestral Hickory Ground near Wetumpka, Alabama, but retain their strong ties and obligations to their homelands and ancestors, along with their traditions and heritage language.  For more information and to find out how you can help save the Hickory Ground, please visit <a href=""http://www.SaveHickoryGround.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.SaveHickoryGround.org</a>.</p>

We want to start a small scale Biochar manufacturing facility focusing on a retail sized packages. The word needs to get out. Not enough people know about Biochar. It is essentially a new market. We believe that the home gardener is the best place to start.  From there, supply landscapers, bulk soil suppliers, farmers, golf courses… anyone who could benefit from better soil.</p>

<p>Biochar has many benefits, for instance, it’s like a tiny natural sponge. Fertilizer runoff in our creeks is a growing and serious concern. Biochar keeps nutrients in the soil where the plants can use them, and out of the watershed. Because of this, Biochar permits the use of less fertilizer and less water.

The Dream:

What if we could take some of the millions of tons of wood waste decomposing in landfills, and turn it into a beneficial soil amendment that:

Saves water
Increases fertility
Increases beneficial microbes
sequesters carbon
An Ancient Secret:
Recently, an ancient secret was rediscovered. A secret poised to return to a world much in need of its benefits. A secret that comes to us from the lost cities of the Amazon, it’s now known as Biochar, and it's been called the true secret of El Dorado!

 Biochar?
Biochar is an agricultural grade charcoal made with the specific purposes of soil amendment and carbon sequestration. It can be made in many different ways from many different things. We want to concentrate on relieving stress on our landfills by diverting natural wood waste like brush, trees from land clearing, untreated lumber, and more, and then make it into Biochar. We want to start a small scale Biochar manufacturing facility focusing on a retail sized packages. The word needs to get out. Not enough people know about Biochar. It is essentially a new market. We believe that the home gardener is the best place to start.  From there, supply landscapers, bulk soil suppliers, farmers, golf courses… anyone who could benefit from better soil.
 
A product with a purpose:

This wood waste rescued from the landfill could now serve multiple purposes. Whether it be added to your landscape soil or raised bed in a back yard.  Every pound put into the earth not only works with nature to help plants thrive. It also stays in the soil for hundreds, or even thousands of years. It’s effectively removed from the carbon cycle. Biochar represents a true chance to significantly slow the buildup of carbon in our atmosphere. A truly carbon NEGATIVE business!

<h3><i><b>Our Story<br/>
</b></i></h3>
<p></p>
<p><b>What are the Barclay Grounds?</b></p>
<p>The land now known as the Barclay Grounds has passed through a succession of owners.  In American pre-history, the region was occupied by the indigenous Lenni Lenape people. The first legal owner under British control was William Penn based on a royal charter from King Charles II in 1681. The land progressed though a series of agriculture uses, but was never built upon. In 1866 Joshua Hartshorne, an Assemblyman in the Pennsylvania legislature, purchased a 4.5 acre block on the northern edge of West Chester to create his estate, but he built his home on the norther portion of the land. Today the southern portion of the property is known as “The Barclay Grounds” – after the Society of Friends retirement home that occupied the old Hartshorne mansion from 1935 to 1997.</p>
<p>In 2002, the Hartshorne Estate was accepted into the National Register of Historic<br/>Places. The lot contains many mature plantings, some of which appear to date from the use of the property as a nursery by John Rutter prior to the Hartshorne's. For the past 80 years the property belonged to a nursing home and and during that time the grounds have been open to the public. Enjoyed by generations of residents and visitors as urban open space, the grounds were identified in West Chester’s 1992 Parks and Recreation Plan as a “quasi park.""  The grounds and plantings were cited as one of the four elements considered “essential” to its listing in the National Register of Historic Places.*</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1451883422/bkxirjgxvatqi7ifr3m8.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 308.745px; height: 246px;""/></p>
<p>In 2013, a new owner of the property submitted plans to sub-divide the southern portion of the property into four building lots for the development of new houses. The plans made provision for most of the trees on the lots to be cut down to make way for the houses. After a public outcry the Borough of West Chester agreed to purchase the Barclay Grounds and preserve them as an open space if this could be done without creating an additional tax burden on the residential tax payers of the Borough.<br/></p>
<p><b>What is the Barclay Grounds Preservation Alliance (BGPA)?</b><br/></p> <p>The Barclay Grounds Preservation Alliance (BGPA) is a group of citizens<br/>from the West Chester, Pa area who recognized the significance of the Barclay<br/>Grounds to West Chester  and the region. They formed a 501 (c) 3 corporation to raise funding to help the Borough purchase and preserve the Barclay Grounds. BGPA worked collaboratively with the Borough Council of West Chester, Mayor Carolyn Committa,  the Natural Lands Trust, the Brandywine Conservancy, State Senator Andrew Dinniman's Office, local state representatives, the Chester County Commissioners, PA state preservations agencies, and legions of volunteers to raise the necessary funds. To date the Alliance has been instrumental in obtaining over $1 million in public grants and private donations towards the $1.2 million purchase price. <br/></p>
<p><b>What We Need</b><br/></p>
<p>The deadline for ""closing"" on the Barclay property, by contractual agreement, was December 31, 2015.  To ensure that sufficient funds were available to complete the “closing” by the December 2015 deadline, the BGPA took on a loan of <b>$144,000.</b> This loan must be repaid within 2 years.</p>
<p>Helping us to repay this loan will prove that caring individuals can make a difference and save open space in our cities and towns for future generations. Your contribution will  secure this legacy. Funds raised beyond our goal will go directly to costs associated with the replenishing and maintaining the grounds which will become a public park. The Barclay Grounds Preservation Alliance is a nonprofit 501(c)(3)

OUR ADDICTION

We’re addicted to bottled water, and it’s a very costly habit. Bottled water sales topped $21 billion in the United States last year, finally surpassing those of soda. But what are we really getting every time we shell out $2 or more on bottled water? Glorified tap water and tons of plastic waste in our landfills and oceans.
 
BOTTLED WATER LIFECYCLE


THE SOLUTIONReefill is a network of stations where members can fill their bottles with cold, filtered tap water on the go -- it’s a low-cost, eco-friendly alternative to bottled water.  Members have unlimited access to all stations for $1.99 per month, or the cost of just one bottled water. HOW IT WORKS  TRACK YOUR GOODWith the Reefill app, members can track how many plastic bottles they have saved from the landfill and how much money they have saved by avoiding buying bottled water.  They can also see the positive impact of members across the network. THE SOLUTION WORKSWe currently have an 8-station pilot network around the Village in New York City, which was partially funded by a grant from New York University to help the NYU community reduce plastic waste. We’ve proven the infrastructure works and although we’ve already saved over 1,000 plastic bottles from the landfill, we know a larger network will have a much bigger impact!  With 100,000 people using Reefill, C02 is reduced and huge amounts of oil, energy, and wasted water will be saved by not manufacturing and transporting bottles. YOUR NETWORK We’re excited to expand the Reefill network throughout New York City and beyond -- that’s where you come in! By reaching our $30,000 goal we can build the Manhattan network beyond our pilot program and with more backers we can expand to outer boroughs as well.$30,000 = 15 new locations!When we reach our initial goal we will have funding for at least one station in neighborhoods across Manhattan including the Financial District, Tribeca, Chinatown, Soho, Lower East Side, East Village, West Village, Gramercy, Chelsea, Garment District, Murray Hill, Midtown East, Midtown West, Upper West Side, Upper East Side, Morningside Heights, Harlem, and Washington Heights.$100,000 = 50 new locations!Coverage throughout Manhattan with multiple locations in most neighborhoods.$250,000 = 125 new locations!When we top $100,000 we will start adding locations in the boroughs outside of Manhattan as well.$500,000 = 250 new locations!With locations across New York City you’ll generally be no more than a few blocks from a fill up.$500,000+ = a new city!

Your support of our mission is more important than ever, and makes a direct impact on fighting climate change.</p>
<h3>We really need your help today</h3>
<p>We’re raising funds to build a greenhouse facility that will dramatically lower our costs every month, will save tremendous effort in the upkeep of our existing growing facility, will improve our growing operation by speeding up the production of our ancient trees, and will dramatically enhance our ability to reach our goal of growing millions upon millions of these iconic and environmentally important trees to be replanted into the environment.</p>

<h2>Some Background</h2>
<p>Our old growth forests are under tremendous stress, and when the oldest and most iconic of these trees are replanted around the globe in living archival libraries, the genetics from these trees can be saved for future study. Archangel is focused on the trees that are the world’s most important trees to clean our water and air, and that capture and store the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide to make the most progress in preventing the worst effects of global warming. We’re working hard on this, but can’t do it alone.<br/><br/>Our propagation &amp; growing facility is located in Copemish, Michigan, a small town in Michigan’s northern lower peninsula. The growing facility we’re using is a converted windowless potato warehouse, built in 1968. Growing these trees, which have been collected from all over the world, requires certain conditions to maximize their growth including the correct amount of light, moisture, and proper temperature. We’ve created the ideal condition to grow these plants, but it comes at a great cost.</p>

<p align=""center"">Old Potato Warehouse</p>
<h2>The Difference You Can Make</h2>
<p>The climate control of our old potato warehouse takes a substantial amount of energy to operate. The lighting bill alone is $1,000 per month. Cooling the warehouse in the warm summers, and heating the warehouse in the frigid winters averages $1,100 per month. This $2,100 monthly bill is a major expense for our operation, and is money we could use in other, more productive areas including collection trips, propagation management, and horticultural expenses. Not to mention the benefit of reducing our carbon footprint that we are creating every month.</p>
<h3>Your Impact</h3>
<p>We have determined that by erecting a large greenhouse on our property and taking advantage of natural lighting and ventilation, we could save approximately $1,760 per month, or $21,150 per year in our heating, cooling, and lighting expenses.<br/><br/>We have the experience to properly control the climate in a new greenhouse. We have estimated the cost to prepare the site, run water and electric, purchase and install a 34’ by 96’ greenhouse structure and special support system to endure our northern Michigan climate to be $65,000.<br/><br/>Your support is the lifeblood of our mission. Your generous donation will help us to reduce our operating costs, will lower our carbon footprint, and most critically will directly benefit our mission.</p>
<h2>Never Before Offered</h2>
<p>One of the most-asked questions we recieve is, ""Can I buy a tree?"" While we are certainly working toward that day where everyone can recieve an ancient tree, the clones we now have in our library are truly unique.</p>
<p>For the first time ever, we are able to offer a few clones of ancient Giant Sequoias, and the largest coast redwood trees that ever lived - they were propagated from stumps cut down over 100 years ago. Your substantial donation to this cause is important, and can come with great reward with a priceless tree.</p>
<p>Of course, we value your support at <em>any</em> level.</p>

I grew up in the middle of the woods in a small town called Benson, North Carolina where I spent my youth amongst the trees and creeks and fields. My parents always told me that when I was a kid I used to always try to escape, first from my crib, then chasing geese for miles to find out where they were going, and as soon as I started driving I was going as far as I could to see the most beautiful sights nature had to offer. Unfortunately, the older I get and the longer I spend working, the more detached I feel from nature, even though I spend every chance I can outside, it still feels like something is missing. I've lost the dreams I used to have of the beautiful sights I would some day immerse myself in. After much deliberation on how to resolve this problem, I decided to leave modern life behind, sell my belongings, and walk across the United States from the Outer Banks of North Carolina to Big Sur in California. I'm not going to set a timespan or a goal for when I want to reach the west coast, honestly my goal is to stay in the wild as long as I can and when I reach Big Sur, I may only rest a few days and then carry on northward to see all of the rest of the beauty the northwest has to offer.

<p>The Yasuni National Park is probably the most
biodiverse part in the world, but is now threaten but oil activities. See our site for information (<a href=""http://www.amazoniaporlavida.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.amazoniaporlavida.org</a>).</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We want to maintain the Yasuni-ITT proposal to keep
underground 900 million barrels, to safe the forests, to respect the
rights of indigenous people living in voluntary isolation and to
contribute to fight climate change. This story as been covered by major media outlets all over the world like <a href=""http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2013/01/125-yasuni-national-park/wallace-text"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">National Geographic </a><br/></p>
<p>But the most important is that this is a first step to a postoil
Ecuador and civilisation, and to safe our Pachamama (Mother Earth). And we need your help.<br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Unfortunatedly, the Ecuadorean government recently announced it will be drilling in this region of the Park, depite that more than 70% or the population wants to leave oil underground. <br/></p>
<p>We are in the process to collect signatures
to launch  a popular referendu, which is our right under Ecuadrean Constituton, yo safe yasuni.</p>
<p> The young group YASunidos
(<a href=""http://www.yaunidos.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.yasunidos.org</a> -
<a href=""http://yasunidosinternacional.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://yasunidosinternacional.wordpress.com/</a>
is leading this campaign and they need your support to buy 10
computers and 10 printers in order to achieve the difficult -but not

The Yasuni National Park is probably the most
biodiverse part in the world, but is now threaten but oil activities. See our site for information (www.amazoniaporlavida.org).


We want to maintain the Yasuni-ITT proposal to keep
underground 900 million barrels, to safe the forests, to respect the
rights of indigenous people living in voluntary isolation and to
contribute to fight climate change. This story as been covered by major media outlets all over the world like National Geographic 
But the most important is that this is a first step to a postoil
Ecuador and civilisation, and to safe our Pachamama (Mother Earth). And we need your help.


Unfortunatedly, the Ecuadorean government recently announced it will be drilling in this region of the Park, depite that more than 70% or the population wants to leave oil underground. 
We are in the process to collect signatures
to launch  a popular referendu, which is our right under Ecuadrean Constituton, yo safe yasuni.
 The young group YASunidos
(www.yasunidos.org -
http://yasunidosinternacional.wordpress.com/
is leading this campaign and they need your support to buy 10
computers and 10 printers in order to achieve the difficult -but not
impossible task to gather 600.000 signatures from ecuadorian
citizens. That's the number of signatures we need to legally launch the referendum at a national level. 
The computers and print/scanners will be used to process
the forms with the signatures in the main cities of the country.
After 6 months, the equipments will be given as a contribution to the
young activists groups in Ecuador.


Together we can acheive this!

<h3><strong>Our goal</strong></h3>
<p>With your help, we aim to raise enough money to make the first ever World Vasectomy Day a hugely successful global event. Our goal is to raise awareness about the environmental impact of rising population on the planet, men’s role in family planning and vasectomy as a solution to prevent unintended pregnancies.</p>

<h3><strong>What is World Vasectomy Day?</strong></h3>
<p>On October 18, 2013 men all over the world, whose families are complete, will dedicate their vasectomy to Planet Earth in a world-first vasectomy-athon to launch the inaugural World Vasectomy Day (WVD).</p>

<h3><strong>Why World Vasectomy Day?</strong></h3>
<p>WVD is a chance for men all over the world to make a very personal choice that has a profoundly public impact on our present and our future. We are asking men who do not want more children to join forces to shoulder the burden of family planning and in so doing, fight for their family, their community, their country and our planet.</p>
<p>WVD will be a world-class knowledge-sharing forum addressing critical science related issues within the context of a highly innovative and ambitious multiplatform public event. But we need YOUR HELP to get there.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>What will happen on World Vasectomy Day?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Vasectomies performed:</strong> The world’s most prolific vasectomist, Dr Doug Stein will perform vasectomies in front of an audience at the Royal Institution of Australia (RiAus) – Australia’s national science hub – to launch the inaugural World Vasectomy Day.</p>

<p><strong>Streamed live:</strong> The event will be the world’s first live-streamed vasectomy-athon. Dr Stein will field questions from both the live Adelaide audience and an international online audience.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion:</strong> There will be a gathering of diverse thought leaders including population expert and author of <em>The Population Bomb</em> Professor Paul Ehrlich who will weigh in on the social, political, cultural and ethical issues raised by the event and Dr Stein’s mission to save the planet… one vasectomy at a time.</p>
<p><strong>Multiple locations around the globe:</strong> While Dr Stein performs vasectomies live from the RiAus in an unorthodox ‘operating theater’, doctors around the world will also perform vasectomies, connected to the event via Skype and social media platforms.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>What we’ve achieved so far</strong></h3>
<p>The good news is we’ve already accomplished an enormous amount so far to lay the foundations for making WVD a reality:</p>
<p><strong>We've made a film:</strong> Our documentary film about Dr Doug Stein - THE VASECTOMIST is now complete after four years of devotion and will premiere in October as a part of WVD celebrations. </p>
<p><strong>We've got doctors:</strong> Vasectomy doctors around the world are signing up for WVD, eager to participate and commit their services to the cause. </p>
<p><strong>We've got speakers:</strong> We are rallying some of the smartest people in the world to come together to lead the conversation.</p>
<p><strong>We've got webisodes:</strong> We’ve already made 21 webisodes that you can find on the homepage of our website to take you on the journey from where this project began through the experiences and realisations of both Doug and Jonathan, as well as learn a heck of a lot about vasectomies along the way.</p>

<p>Coproduction partners New York-based Gabriel Films founded by Jonathan Stack, and Sydney-based Smith&amp;Nasht founded by Simon Nasht, are companies focused on social issue storytelling. We have come together to create a new conversation about population and consumption, by asking men to take a very personal action to change the world.

<p>Beginning in 2011 Lynda and John Maguire along with Andrew Hatch

a totally self-funded 3.75 million gallons per year Biodiesel production
facility in Bow, New Hampshire. As a true innovator in Biofuels production, we have leveraged the Bio-Tech\Bio-Pharma rich environment of the Northeast to
create a very compact, highly effective and energy efficient platform for

<h3>
<b>What We Will Do</b>
</h3>
<p>Granite State Biofuels will
continue to produce Biodiesel and refine its innovative Biotech manufacturing
process as well as add much needed in-process lab testing to ensure the highest
possible output quality. Upgrades to energy efficiency and product distillation
will also continue in our ever-evolving efforts to lower production costs
making Biodiesel more competitive without subsidies.</p>
<p>We need to purchase analytical
equipment which will help us to refine our process in real time. Right now,
independent testing labs take several days to report results and are expensive.
This $40,000 investment will significantly increase our speed of development
and lower our cost of production. </p>

<p><b><i>Help
us grow the process that will restore and redefine community economics, aid our
environment and reduce our dependence on fossil fuels by supporting our
campaign and keeping an eye out for others like it. Remember smart roads are
truly incredible but they are just a small part of the change we must have to
grow the total spectrum of the new Alternative Revolution.</i></b></p>
<p>Help Granite State Biofuels
continue to innovate Alternative Energy Solutions that impact communities,
states, our Nation and our planet through the creation of 
self-sufficient community scale Biodiesel Production Facilities. </p>
<p>The efforts of biofuel producers
like GSB will be the disruptive force in re-distributing the wealth of energy
from massively profiteering oil refineries back to communities.</p>
<h4>Direct impact on the communities in which
Biodiesel is produced include: </h4>
<ul>
<li>Increased
     tax base from entire Biodiesel value chain. </li>
<li>Jobs created for feedstock farming or collection of
     waste oils, production of Biodiesel and distribution by local outlets and
     distributors. </li>
<li>Skilled
     jobs created for Biodiesel production and distribution. </li>
<li>Jobs
     for Domestic oil burner technicians. Protection for small oil heat
     distributors against onslaught of natural gas conversions. </li>
<li>Income
     for local feedstock producers, collectors and refiners. </li>
<li>Healthier people and cleaner environments resulting
     from reduced emissions and non-polluting production methods. </li>
</ul>
<p>By choosing biodiesel, consumers
can elect to support a local, safe alternative. GSB can afford to supply
consumers directly as they will buy 50 gallons or more at a time.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If we are fortunate to secure additional funding, we will use this to begin
the process of establishing our second production facility. It has always been
our plan to establish a source of clean renewable fuels suitable for marine and
then jet applications. Biodiesel is truly biodegradable, it is less caustic
than salt and biodegrades faster than sugar making it an ideal fuel for use on
and around our precious oceans and fragile atmosphere. These industries know
they need to have alternatives but they are simply not there in the quantities
required. Numerous <a href=""http://domesticfuel.com/2014/07/15/aviation-marine-biofuels-to-increase-by-2024/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">market research efforts</a> are predicting very high demand and
growth in these areas and we feel we have the technology to deliver in these
markets.  </p>
<p>We will continue our efforts with
researchers, industry groups and government agencies to further the growth of
viable and scalable drop-in alternative fuel production methods. Next
generation biofuels are in great demand by all industry users as they represent
a direct and drop-in replacement for fossil fuels and GSB is dedicated and
determined to play a role in their development and proliferation.</p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/772008/files/20140807063734-innovation.jpg?1407418654"" src="""" style=""""/></p></span><h3><b><span>Technical Stuff</span></b></h3>
<span></span><span>
<p>Our
unique technology is based on process intensification of the reaction
components, vegetable oil and methyl alcohol. The intensification of the
reaction is the primary process in biodiesel production.</p>
<p>Intensification directly effects
the reaction rate and the reaction completion.</p>
<p>If the reaction rate is increased
ten times compared to classical biodiesel production technologies the equipment
productivity is increased 4-5 times, thus reducing the plant cost 2-3 times
making it very easy and economical to add plants at the community level where
they can do the most good.</p>
<p>Biodiesel makes a strong case for
being a contender in a form of positively disruptive economic change that will
fuel innovation across a multitude of areas and promote continued growth of
measures to ensure petroleum independence. Technology, agriculture, environment
and manufacturing will all play major roles as the transition to renewable
energy economics continues.</p>

<h3>Why Indiegogo Gets It!</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Danae Ringelmann set about making capital available to anyone with a Vision
that could capture the imagination and inspire others to participate in and
fund that Vision. She and her partners are delivering the Future of Finance!</p>
<p>Indiegogo represents a unique and
powerful opportunity for funding change through the development and empowerment
of ideas and beliefs. What we are seeking is not simply funding but kinship in
the belief that Indiegogo communities are made up of like-minded and motivated
individuals that want to support specific things and enact powerful
change.  While large corporations, lobbying firms, supporters of special
interests and government currently decide policy so many of us don't agree
with, we are now being afforded the ability to cooperatively support efforts
that we can believe in with crowdfunding communities.</p>
<h3>Democratize the Monopoly of Petroleum as Indiegogo has done
with Banking and Finance! </h3>
<p> All around the world the
technology and the materials exist to bring about the change <i>WE</i> know
must come about but <i>WE</i> must embrace and support the transition by
supporting any and all credible efforts to ensure that change is seeded and
cultivated. </p>
<p><i>Indiegogo
community support can be that critical cooperative funding opportunity that
banks simply can't offer. </i></p>

Granite State Biofuels - a Woman owned producer of Biodiesel in the Capital
Region of New Hampshire.


 While a replacement for diesel or jet fuel may not seem as cool as
an intelligent road system or next-gen smart phone it plays a HUGE but
largely transparent role in your personal lives and nearly all aspects are not
very beneficial. 


Diesel and Jet Fuels are the two fundamental energy fuels that
drive the world. Nearly everything you can imagine is moved by them and so is the price we pay for those things.




We ask you to pause a moment to think about fuels that do not
require us to send our friends and family around the world to die in defense of
petroleum reserves that poison our environment and result in a third of the US
debt we will pass on to our children's grand-children.
 Imagine just for a moment the impact of not having our Military police oil supplies around the world.


 
Who We Are



Granite State Biofuels is a Woman Majority owned producer of
Biodiesel in the Capital Region of New Hampshire.
Beginning in 2011 Lynda and John Maguire along with Andrew Hatch
began the process of creation and innovation that has lead them to what is now
a totally self-funded 3.75 million gallons per year Biodiesel production
facility in Bow, New Hampshire. As a true innovator in Biofuels production, we have leveraged the Bio-Tech\Bio-Pharma rich environment of the Northeast to
create a very compact, highly effective and energy efficient platform for
manufacturing Biodiesel that can be easily distributed.


What We Will Do

Granite State Biofuels will
continue to produce Biodiesel and refine its innovative Biotech manufacturing
process as well as add much needed in-process lab testing to ensure the highest
possible output quality. Upgrades to energy efficiency and product distillation
will also continue in our ever-evolving efforts to lower production costs
making Biodiesel more competitive without subsidies.
We need to purchase analytical
equipment which will help us to refine our process in real time. Right now,
independent testing labs take several days to report results and are expensive.
This $40,000 investment will significantly increase our speed of development
and lower our cost of production. 

Help
us grow the process that will restore and redefine community economics, aid our
environment and reduce our dependence on fossil fuels by supporting our
campaign and keeping an eye out for others like it. Remember smart roads are
truly incredible but they are just a small part of the change we must have to
grow the total spectrum of the new Alternative Revolution.
Help Granite State Biofuels
continue to innovate Alternative Energy Solutions that impact communities,
states, our Nation and our planet through the creation of 
self-sufficient community scale Biodiesel Production Facilities. 
The efforts of biofuel producers
like GSB will be the disruptive force in re-distributing the wealth of energy
from massively profiteering oil refineries back to communities.
Direct impact on the communities in which
Biodiesel is produced include: 

Increased
     tax base from entire Biodiesel value chain. 
Jobs created for feedstock farming or collection of
     waste oils, production of Biodiesel and distribution by local outlets and
     distributors. 
Skilled
     jobs created for Biodiesel production and distribution. 
Jobs
     for Domestic oil burner technicians. Protection for small oil heat
     distributors against onslaught of natural gas conversions. 
Income
     for local feedstock producers, collectors and refiners. 
Healthier people and cleaner environments resulting
     from reduced emissions and non-polluting production methods. 

By choosing biodiesel, consumers
can elect to support a local, safe alternative. GSB can afford to supply
consumers directly as they will buy 50 gallons or more at a time.

If we are fortunate to secure additional funding, we will use this to begin
the process of establishing our second production facility. It has always been
our plan to establish a source of clean renewable fuels suitable for marine and
then jet applications. Biodiesel is truly biodegradable, it is less caustic
than salt and biodegrades faster than sugar making it an ideal fuel for use on
and around our precious oceans and fragile atmosphere. These industries know
they need to have alternatives but they are simply not there in the quantities
required. Numerous market research efforts are predicting very high demand and
growth in these areas and we feel we have the technology to deliver in these
markets.  
We will continue our efforts with
researchers, industry groups and government agencies to further the growth of
viable and scalable drop-in alternative fuel production methods. Next
generation biofuels are in great demand by all industry users as they represent
a direct and drop-in replacement for fossil fuels and GSB is dedicated and
determined to play a role in their development and proliferation.

Technical Stuff

Our
unique technology is based on process intensification of the reaction
components, vegetable oil and methyl alcohol. The intensification of the
reaction is the primary process in biodiesel production.
Intensification directly effects
the reaction rate and the reaction completion.
If the reaction rate is increased
ten times compared to classical biodiesel production technologies the equipment
productivity is increased 4-5 times, thus reducing the plant cost 2-3 times
making it very easy and economical to add plants at the community level where
they can do the most good.
Biodiesel makes a strong case for
being a contender in a form of positively disruptive economic change that will
fuel innovation across a multitude of areas and promote continued growth of
measures to ensure petroleum independence. Technology, agriculture, environment
and manufacturing will all play major roles as the transition to renewable
energy economics continues.

Why Indiegogo Gets It!

Danae Ringelmann set about making capital available to anyone with a Vision
that could capture the imagination and inspire others to participate in and
fund that Vision. She and her partners are delivering the Future of Finance!
Indiegogo represents a unique and
powerful opportunity for funding change through the development and empowerment
of ideas and beliefs. What we are seeking is not simply funding but kinship in
the belief that Indiegogo communities are made up of like-minded and motivated
individuals that want to support specific things and enact powerful
change.  While large corporations, lobbying firms, supporters of special
interests and government currently decide policy so many of us don't agree
with, we are now being afforded the ability to cooperatively support efforts
that we can believe in with crowdfunding communities.
Democratize the Monopoly of Petroleum as Indiegogo has done
with Banking and Finance! 
 All around the world the
technology and the materials exist to bring about the change WE know
must come about but WE must embrace and support the transition by
supporting any and all credible efforts to ensure that change is seeded and
cultivated. 
Indiegogo
community support can be that critical cooperative funding opportunity that
banks simply can't offer. 

 



Biodiesel Today



Biodiesel is crafted from locally available resources and usage
provides a host of economic benefits for local communities. The community-based
model of distributed Biodiesel production we have developed is particularly
beneficial as available feedstocks are locally grown or collected, converted to
biodiesel, then distributed and used within the community. This benefits the
local economy by keeping energy dollars in the community instead of sending
them to foreign oil producers and refineries outside the community. 
 

Biodiesel makes a strong case for being a contender in a form of
positively disruptive economic change that will fuel innovation across a
multitude of areas and promote continued growth of measures to ensure petroleum
independence. Technology, agriculture, environment and manufacturing will all
play major roles as the transition to renewable energy economics continues.",8.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>Ven. Rev. Patrick McCollum is a world peace visionary and planetary activist. He has been invited to participate in several significant world peace events. His appearance and contribution at these next few events will be critical for peace and we need your help to make it happen. His story has been very interesting and magical.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;background-color: initial;"">Who Is Patrick McCollum?</span></p>
</div><h3></h3><p></p>
<p>Reverend Patrick McCollum is for now one of the best kept secrets in our world. Very few know that not only is he an interfaith chaplain and Wiccan Priest who carries the knowledge of the ""Old Way,"" he has also been honored by spiritual leaders in many spiritual circles around the world. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Patrick has been named as a ""World Inner Peace Ambassador"" by Buddhist spiritual leaders in Thailand. He was an honored guest speaker at the World Culture Forum in Kazakstan 2010 where he spoke to political and spiritual leaders from over 80 countries on the importance of our harmonious connection with Nature and with each other. He has been recognized as a Saint in India and has also been honored as the 'King of Peace' by the World Peace Foundation and renowned Tibetan Buddhist Rimposche, Lama Gangchen. He is known by Native Americans as, ""He Who Speaks With the Mother"" due to his work to secure indigenous sacred sites and his advocacy on behalf of native populations. In 2011 he was honored with receiving the Mahatma Gandhi Award for Religious Pluralism. He hand constructed a violin, which has become known internationally as the 'World Peace Violin' and he has been invited to share it at the UN's International Peace Day next fall. Last January, Patrick had the honor to lead the opening prayer at the Maha Kumba Mela in India, a spiritual gathering that attracted over 100 million people. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Patrick is quickly becoming one of the foremost voices in our world on the topics of creating world peace and sustaining all people. His message inspires audiences to recognize our inherent interconnection through a common narrative, which gives us greater access to envisioning and creating a common goal: a world that works for everyone. He is changing the world by creating peace bridges between countries and people, inspiring youth, working to support women's rights, and religious equality around the world.</p><p></p><p><b>What is this opportunity?</b></p><p><b></b></p><p></p>
<p>Rev. McCollum will begin by opening the World Peace Concert at Lake Tahoe on September 7. In addition to speaking at the event, the internationally acclaimed World Peace Violin (more information here <a href=""http://www.patrickmccollum.org/world-peace-viol"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.patrickmccollum.org/world-peace-viol</a>...), created by Rev. McCollum, will be played by world renowned violinist, Scarlet Rivera.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then Rev. McCollum will attend the International Day of Peace at the United Nations, where he is sponsoring a new youth representative to attend the UN as a part of the Patrick McCollum Foundation's youth leadership program.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary 
Ven. Rev. Patrick McCollum is a world peace visionary and planetary activist. He has been invited to participate in several significant world peace events. His appearance and contribution at these next few events will be critical for peace and we need your help to make it happen. His story has been very interesting and magical.
Who Is Patrick McCollum?

Reverend Patrick McCollum is for now one of the best kept secrets in our world. Very few know that not only is he an interfaith chaplain and Wiccan Priest who carries the knowledge of the ""Old Way,"" he has also been honored by spiritual leaders in many spiritual circles around the world. 

Patrick has been named as a ""World Inner Peace Ambassador"" by Buddhist spiritual leaders in Thailand. He was an honored guest speaker at the World Culture Forum in Kazakstan 2010 where he spoke to political and spiritual leaders from over 80 countries on the importance of our harmonious connection with Nature and with each other. He has been recognized as a Saint in India and has also been honored as the 'King of Peace' by the World Peace Foundation and renowned Tibetan Buddhist Rimposche, Lama Gangchen. He is known by Native Americans as, ""He Who Speaks With the Mother"" due to his work to secure indigenous sacred sites and his advocacy on behalf of native populations. In 2011 he was honored with receiving the Mahatma Gandhi Award for Religious Pluralism. He hand constructed a violin, which has become known internationally as the 'World Peace Violin' and he has been invited to share it at the UN's International Peace Day next fall. Last January, Patrick had the honor to lead the opening prayer at the Maha Kumba Mela in India, a spiritual gathering that attracted over 100 million people. 

Patrick is quickly becoming one of the foremost voices in our world on the topics of creating world peace and sustaining all people. His message inspires audiences to recognize our inherent interconnection through a common narrative, which gives us greater access to envisioning and creating a common goal: a world that works for everyone. He is changing the world by creating peace bridges between countries and people, inspiring youth, working to support women's rights, and religious equality around the world.What is this opportunity?
Rev. McCollum will begin by opening the World Peace Concert at Lake Tahoe on September 7. In addition to speaking at the event, the internationally acclaimed World Peace Violin (more information here http://www.patrickmccollum.org/world-peace-viol...), created by Rev. McCollum, will be played by world renowned violinist, Scarlet Rivera.

Then Rev. McCollum will attend the International Day of Peace at the United Nations, where he is sponsoring a new youth representative to attend the UN as a part of the Patrick McCollum Foundation's youth leadership program.

Next, Rev. McCollum will speak at the International Vigil for Peace & Sustainability on stage at Central Park in New York on Sept 21st. Then Rev. McCollum travels to Atlanta Georgia, to open the Black Tie Gala ... World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, hosted by President Jimmy Carter and featuring eight Nobel peace prize recipients. 

Following that, Rev. McCollum travels to India, where he is the Keynote Speaker and Distinguished Guest for the International Festival on Yoga & Spirituality, speaking on a new sustainable narrative for a peaceful planet.

Rev. McCollum will finish his peace tour speaking by at the School of Management Sciences in Varanasi India where he will share with advanced international business students how they through responsible business practices, can contribute to world peace.Why are we asking for financial support?
While Patrick's service and presence at these powerful events is clearly of high value, the organizers of the events do not have the financial means to provide for his airfare. Our desire is not only to get him there, but to insure his safe travels and maximize the outreach of the important messages he has to share.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p>We are James, Jessica, and Zan, and together we make up One Small Steppe, a three-person Scottish-American team participating in the Mongol Rally 2013.  With your help, we hope to offset the travel costs of an epic 10,000 mile journey through the heart of Asia to raise funds and awareness for Cool Earth, a charity protecting the rain forest to combat climate change.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What Are We Doing?</strong></p>
<p>We’re driving in the Mongol Rally!  The Mongol Rally is a small car charity rally in which teams from across the globe drive London, England, to Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia, in sub-compact vehicles with 1200 cc engines.  The Rally is run by a UK-based organization called The Adventurists (<a href=""http://www.theadventurists.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.theadventurists.com</a>) with the stated mission to “make the world less boring” by encouraging people to embrace the spirit of old-fashioned adventure rather than luxury travel.</p>
<p>The Adventurists are not just encouraging people to travel the world, but also save it.  To join their events, each team must raise a minimum of £1000 pounds (approximately $1600) for charity.  With seven other charity challenges, hundreds of vehicles and thousands of people participating every year, the Adventurists have raised over £3.7 million pounds (close to $6 million) in charity money since 2004.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What Is The Charity?</strong></p>
<p>As of 2012, the official charity of all Adventurist challenges is Cool Earth (<a href=""http://www.coolearth.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.coolearth.org</a>), a UK-based NGO which protects critically threatened areas of South American rainforest.  Founded in 2007, Cool Earth sets itself apart from other non-profits fighting climate change in many ways:</p>
<p>Cool Earth protects areas of rainforest that would otherwise be cleared within the next 18 months, making real-time impact</p>
<p>90% of all donations go directly to funding projects and only 10% go towards Cool Earth’s administration</p>
<p>Cool Earth does this not buy land, but empowers the communities already living on it to have the means and incentives to resist logging</p>
<p><strong>Cool Earth does this by providing rainforest people with:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Education and health care within their own communities.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Renewable sources of income which leave the forest standing.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The means to patrol their land against illegal logging.</strong></li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p><strong>Why Does It Matter?</strong></p>
<p>The destruction of the rainforest is a major environmental and humanitarian crisis.  Amazonian communities and governments often see no way to profit from their land other than to sell it for clearing.  This provides only very short-term benefits, while doing incalculable long-term harm to their traditional ways of life as well as the planet as a whole. </p>
<p><strong>Cool Earth gives many reasons why the rain forest is far more valuable standing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In one year, the roughly one billion acres of standing rainforest absorb an amount of carbon dioxide equal to the entire CO2 emissions of the United States. </strong></li>
<li><strong>One large rainforest tree stores about 30 tons of carbon – three times what the average person in a developed country produces in one year.</strong></li>
<li><strong>It is estimated that global rises in temperatures due to CO2 emissions would have progressed 10% faster without the Amazon rainforest carbon sink. </strong></li>
<li><strong>150 acres of rainforest are cleared every minute, equal to an area roughly the size of Los Angeles over the course of one mouth. </strong></li>
<li><strong>Clearing one acre of rainforest releases 260 tons of CO2, the equivalent of driving a car around the world 32 times.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The rainforest is home to two-thirds of all the biodiversity on the planet.  Many species which live there, especially plants with potential medical value, have not been studied.</strong></li>
<li><strong>1.6 billion people depend on rainforests for their livelihoods.</strong></li>
<li><strong>350 million people live in the rainforest itself, a way of life which includes knowledge of many medical plants and their properties, and which is immediately threatened.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Cleared rain forest soils only remain useful for other activities such as cattle ranching for about two years, after which the soil is depleted and more new land must be cleared, continuing the cycle.</strong></li>
</ul><p>Since 2007, Cool Earth has saved 330,000 acres of rainforest (More since our video was filmed!  Cool Earth's mission is working in real time!), which serve as a barrier to 1.2 million more.  Between all their challenges combined, the Adventurists have raised almost $6 million for a variety of charities since 2004.  Cool Earth needs only about $100 to save an acre of rainforest.  Now the combined efforts of all Adventurists’ fundraising will go towards Cool Earth, a charity which impacts every adventure-hosting country, and every person on the planet.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Who Are We?</strong></p>
<p>The team formed in 2009 when Zan learned about the Mongol Rally while in Mongolia doing volunteer work, and started planning to take on the challenge with Jessica, a long-time friend from middle school.  James came on board after meeting Zan through a student organization he headed in Edinburgh, Scotland where they were finishing their bachelor’s and master’s degrees, respectively, in the spring of 2012.  In July the team was christened One Small Steppe and signed up to participate in the Mongol Rally 2013.</p>
<p>As a team we bring a variety of skills to the Rally.  James, a biology graduate of Edinburgh University, has toured Oman by jeep; Jessica studied anthropology at the University of Cincinnati and is an online entrepreneur; while Zan has traveled extensively in Asia and speaks Russian and Mongolian, which she currently studies, along with Mongolian history and current affairs in the department of Central Eurasian Studies at the University of Indiana, Bloomington.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How Will It Work?</strong></p>
<p>As a team participating in the 2013 Mongol Rally, One Small Steppe is obligated to raise at least $1600 which will be donated directly to Cool Earth.  We have also pledged to make personal donations to Cool Earth beyond the $1600 minimum to the amount which offsets the carbon footprint of our travel by air and overland.  To raise this direct charity money, we are organizing fund raising events in our communities. </p>
<p>Apart from this, we are using Indiegogo to raise as much money as possible to offset the cost of our travel.  Our stated goal of $5000 is a bare minimum that would cover most car-related expenses, and we hope to raise money beyond this goal.</p>
<p><strong>First and foremost this money would cover:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Buying a used car</strong></li>
<li><strong>Fuel</strong></li>
<li><strong>Car insurance</strong></li>
<li><strong>Fitting the car with van tires and a shield under the carriage to minimize wear</strong></li>
<li><strong>On-the-road car maintenance</strong></li>
</ul><p>Donating to our car expenses still contributes to charity indirectly, because when we arrive in Mongolia, our car will be auctioned to raise yet more funds for Cool Earth.</p>
<p><strong>Other costs of the trip include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plane tickets for two of us to Britain and all of us back from Mongolia</strong></li>
<li><strong>Visas for countries we pass through</strong></li>
<li><strong>Travel insurance</strong></li>
<li><strong>Supplies</strong></li>
<li><strong>Possible emergencies</strong></li>
</ul><p>Any additional money we raise will make our trip that much more worry-free.  All left-over funds will be donated to Cool Earth.  And if for any reason we can’t participate in the rally at all, any funds we’ve already collected will go directly to Cool Earth.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why Should You Help?</strong></p>
<p>Our team believes that adventure and philanthropy go hand in hand.  By making the drive, we’ll spread the news about Cool Earth’s mission beyond our friends and family, to every country we drive through.  Via the internet, we’ll update from the road.  At the journey’s end, more funds will be raised for Cool Earth when our car is auctioned in Mongolia.  Connecting with the world and its peoples is crucial to caring about its future.  By supporting our trip fund, you can help make joining adventure and philanthropy a reality.</p>
<p>All the members of One Small Steppe are in our early 20’s and are, or until recently were, students.  Our families have all been extremely supportive of our ambitions, but we don’t want to burden them or put ourselves in debt to achieve them.  And because we realize that contributing money for spark plugs and spare tires doesn’t have quite the same intrinsic reward as donating directly to charity, we’re offering some great incentive gifts, some of which will come straight from Mongolia!*</p>
<p>$5000 may seem like a lot of money, but if all of our Facebook friends gave just $5, the total would reach $5020 without any one person spending more than the price of a few coffees.  You don’t have to make a large contribution to make a difference in our campaign.  Giving a little and spreading the word to your friends and on your social networks could help as much as giving a larger sum.  Help us do something great for the earth and have the time of our lives while we’re at it!</p>
<p> </p>

We are hoping our community (that's you!: friends; family; small farm supporters; burners; Cracked readers; other weird people; citizens of the world) will band together to help make our exhibit an epic win! We want to prove that projects like this (that is, sustainable living) is not only attainable but successful! Become part of our exhibit by donating. Even $1 will help. Please share our story with your friends and family if you think they'd be interested in what we are trying to do. It is through your generosity and love that we will make sustainable attainable.See where the money goes:
400' horse fence with gate: $1618.55

<p>This campaign was created on Indiegogo by me, the Communications and Development Director for White Buffalo Farm.  I have been helping Wayne,since 2010.   We are steering a transition for the farm to new ownership as Wayne needs to retire and would like to hand over the farm to a new management team.

<p>We are three guys who love adventure! Our pursuit of adventure led us to spontaneously sign up to ""The Rickshaw Run"", a cross India epic adventure driving a traditional ""glorfied lawnmower"" on wheels!...Also known as a Indian Rickshaw.  </p>
<p>Basically the three of us are going to cram into a rickshaw and drive 3500km in 14 days from Jaisalmer to Kerala (North to South).   Stupid? Daring? Fun?... Maybe a bit of everything, but one thing is for sure along the way we are going to need the help of random strangers!  We are going to need HELP to successfully complete this journey! </p>
<p>Realistically we realized there is no way we are going to be able to succesfully complete this unless along the way random people help us out.  So we began to think of different times in our lives while adventuring when random people have helped us in times we needed it.  Whether it be the smallest simplest thing, or something massive!  We began to think how could we give back for all the times people have helped us out, and made us happy while adventuring!</p>

<p>From all of us at Clearwater, thank you very much for considering participating in this campaign!</p>
<h3>The Clearwater Hudson River Sloop Story</h3>
<p>Clearwater was founded by Pete Seeger, legendary musician, singer, songwriter, folklorist, activist, environmentalist, and peace advocate, and one of the most influential people of the twentieth century. In 1966, in despair over the pollution of his beloved Hudson River, Seeger announced plans to “build a boat to save the river.”  At the time, the Hudson was rank with raw sewage, toxic chemicals and oil pollution; fish had disappeared over many miles of its length. Seeger, along with many other concerned individuals, believed a majestic replica of the sloops that sailed the Hudson in the 18th and 19th centuries would bring people to the river where they could experience its beauty and be moved to preserve it. Inspired by that vision, the organization began with the launch of the sloop Clearwater in 1969 —a majestic 106-foot long replica vessel.</p>
<p>The sloop Clearwater is recognized as America’s Environmental Flagship and is among the first vessels in the United States to conduct science-based environmental education aboard a sailing ship, creating the template for environmental education programs around the world. More than half a million people have experienced their first real look at the Hudson River estuary’s ecosystem aboard Clearwater. In 2004, the sloop Clearwater was named to the National Register of Historic Places for its groundbreaking role in the environmental movement.</p>
<p>Today, Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, Inc. and the iconic sloop Clearwater are carrying forward Pete Seeger’s legacy by partnering with Hudson Valley schools and community leaders to raise the bar of environmental education and encouraging youth to become involved as active stewards of their environment and the Hudson River. Through the organization's multiple environmental education programs, youth empowerment programs, environmental action campaigns, Green Cities initiatives, and unique approach to public outreach, the sloop Clearwater is recognized as a symbol of grassroots action through hands-on learning, music, and celebration.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>We Value Your Donation &amp; Will Put It To Good Use</h3>
<p>Starting March 1st, Clearwater will be launching a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo, the worldwide leader in crowdfunding. This is a great opportunity to make contributions to Clearwater and receive a wonderful reward for your help! We are fundraising in conjunction with our celebration of <strong>Clearwater's 50th year</strong> and the <strong>100th anniversary of Pete Seeger's life</strong>. If you would like to support Clearwater's ongoing educational and activist initiatives please consider participating in this campaign!</p>
<p>You will be able to purchase incentives that have been generously donated to Clearwater on the campaign site. <strong>Every week will have new incentives!</strong> The incentives include incredible autographed guitars by artists such as<strong> The Indigo Girls, Ani Difranco; private house concerts from James Maddock, Aztec Two-Step, Vance Gilbert and Cliff Eberhardt; signed albums by folks like Tom Paxton and Dar Williams; signed artwork by Ani Difranco, Elliott Landy, and Bob Gruen; an incredible one of a kind banjo signed nearly all of the folk royalty you can think of, AND SO MUCH MORE</strong>!  YOU help Clearwater and get rewarded for your generosity with something wonderful in exchange.</p>
</div><div><h3>Your Support Means Continued Environmental &amp; Social Advocacy and Education</h3></div><div>
<p>""Participation - that’s what’s gonna save the human race.” These are the inspiring words of our founder, folk music icon and environmental activist, Pete Seeger, and they embody the spirit of Clearwater, both as an organization and a community. Through this Indiegogo campaign, we ask that you consider participating, as we celebrate two milestone anniversaries this year. We’ve succeeded in so many ways, thanks to you!</p>
<p>On May 17th, we commemorate the 50th anniversary of the launch of our namesake educational vessel and America’s environmental flagship, the sloop Clearwater. Clearwater has become the symbol for grassroots activism and environmental education in the Hudson Valley.</p>
<p>On May 3rd, we also celebrate the 100th anniversary of the birth of Pete Seeger. It was Pete’s vision and determination to clean up the Hudson River that paved the way for today’s environmental movement.</p>
<p>Over the last fifty years, Clearwater has educated hundreds of thousands of passengers about issues that threaten the Hudson River and the species living in and around its waters.</p>
<p>From the beginning, music has the way in which we celebrate the River and the work that we do to inspire others to participate. What started out as a small folk picnic to help raise funds for the building of Clearwater, has become the country's oldest and largest music and environmental festival. This year’s Great Hudson River Revival will take place on June 15th and 16th at Croton Point Park in Westchester County, NY.</p>
<p>Clearwater has been involved in many advocacy campaigns including PCB remediation in the Hudson River and the closure and safe decommissioning of the Indian Point Nuclear Power Plant. The organization has also undertaken an Article 78 lawsuit against the NY State Public Service Commission to stop the $7.6 billion mandatory subsidy to keep four aging nuclear power plants in operation when they should be shutting down.</p>
<p>Without your support we could not have achieved so many victories over the past fifty years. The next 50 years will be hugely important for this planet. Now, more than ever, we need to keep educating and advocating for the environment.</p>

The Clearwater Hudson River Sloop Story
Clearwater was founded by Pete Seeger, legendary musician, singer, songwriter, folklorist, activist, environmentalist, and peace advocate, and one of the most influential people of the twentieth century. In 1966, in despair over the pollution of his beloved Hudson River, Seeger announced plans to “build a boat to save the river.”  At the time, the Hudson was rank with raw sewage, toxic chemicals and oil pollution; fish had disappeared over many miles of its length. Seeger, along with many other concerned individuals, believed a majestic replica of the sloops that sailed the Hudson in the 18th and 19th centuries would bring people to the river where they could experience its beauty and be moved to preserve it. Inspired by that vision, the organization began with the launch of the sloop Clearwater in 1969 —a majestic 106-foot long replica vessel.
The sloop Clearwater is recognized as America’s Environmental Flagship and is among the first vessels in the United States to conduct science-based environmental education aboard a sailing ship, creating the template for environmental education programs around the world. More than half a million people have experienced their first real look at the Hudson River estuary’s ecosystem aboard Clearwater. In 2004, the sloop Clearwater was named to the National Register of Historic Places for its groundbreaking role in the environmental movement.
Today, Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, Inc. and the iconic sloop Clearwater are carrying forward Pete Seeger’s legacy by partnering with Hudson Valley schools and community leaders to raise the bar of environmental education and encouraging youth to become involved as active stewards of their environment and the Hudson River. Through the organization's multiple environmental education programs, youth empowerment programs, environmental action campaigns, Green Cities initiatives, and unique approach to public outreach, the sloop Clearwater is recognized as a symbol of grassroots action through hands-on learning, music, and celebration.

We Value Your Donation & Will Put It To Good Use
Starting March 1st, Clearwater will be launching a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo, the worldwide leader in crowdfunding. This is a great opportunity to make contributions to Clearwater and receive a wonderful reward for your help! We are fundraising in conjunction with our celebration of Clearwater's 50th year and the 100th anniversary of Pete Seeger's life. If you would like to support Clearwater's ongoing educational and activist initiatives please consider participating in this campaign!
You will be able to purchase incentives that have been generously donated to Clearwater on the campaign site. Every week will have new incentives! The incentives include incredible autographed guitars by artists such as The Indigo Girls, Ani Difranco; private house concerts from James Maddock, Aztec Two-Step, Vance Gilbert and Cliff Eberhardt; signed albums by folks like Tom Paxton and Dar Williams; signed artwork by Ani Difranco, Elliott Landy, and Bob Gruen; an incredible one of a kind banjo signed nearly all of the folk royalty you can think of, AND SO MUCH MORE!  YOU help Clearwater and get rewarded for your generosity with something wonderful in exchange.
Your Support Means Continued Environmental & Social Advocacy and Education
""Participation - that’s what’s gonna save the human race.” These are the inspiring words of our founder, folk music icon and environmental activist, Pete Seeger, and they embody the spirit of Clearwater, both as an organization and a community. Through this Indiegogo campaign, we ask that you consider participating, as we celebrate two milestone anniversaries this year. We’ve succeeded in so many ways, thanks to you!
On May 17th, we commemorate the 50th anniversary of the launch of our namesake educational vessel and America’s environmental flagship, the sloop Clearwater. Clearwater has become the symbol for grassroots activism and environmental education in the Hudson Valley.
On May 3rd, we also celebrate the 100th anniversary of the birth of Pete Seeger. It was Pete’s vision and determination to clean up the Hudson River that paved the way for today’s environmental movement.
Over the last fifty years, Clearwater has educated hundreds of thousands of passengers about issues that threaten the Hudson River and the species living in and around its waters.
From the beginning, music has the way in which we celebrate the River and the work that we do to inspire others to participate. What started out as a small folk picnic to help raise funds for the building of Clearwater, has become the country's oldest and largest music and environmental festival. This year’s Great Hudson River Revival will take place on June 15th and 16th at Croton Point Park in Westchester County, NY.
Clearwater has been involved in many advocacy campaigns including PCB remediation in the Hudson River and the closure and safe decommissioning of the Indian Point Nuclear Power Plant. The organization has also undertaken an Article 78 lawsuit against the NY State Public Service Commission to stop the $7.6 billion mandatory subsidy to keep four aging nuclear power plants in operation when they should be shutting down.
Without your support we could not have achieved so many victories over the past fifty years. The next 50 years will be hugely important for this planet. Now, more than ever, we need to keep educating and advocating for the environment.
By contributing to this Indiegogo campaign, you’ll have the opportunity to receive unique incentives. We’ve gathered dozens of items to reward our donors, including signed CDs, artwork, house concerts by popular bands, and signed instruments from friends of Clearwater and Pete Seeger.
In the spirit of participation, we ask you to join us, make a contribution, roll up your sleeves, come aboard, and become a part of our mission to preserve and protect the Hudson River.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are a few neighbors and composters who wish composting were easy in our city.  We've found it is hard to compost in Aurora, Colorado!  That's why we want to set up 1, 2, or 3 free leaf drop off days in the fall.  They will be open for half of the day on City of Aurora land, ready for leaf drop off in paper or compostable bags.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need your help to make it happen:</p>

<li>If we earn $1300 or more, we will have one in October, November, or December.</li>
<li>The City of Aurora is providing the land and infrastructure for the drop offs.  If we can fundraise for the containers, they can do the rest!</li>

I always liked cycling and my dream was to live on a sailboat. I am lover of the sea and nature so I can´t see all these things happening without do anything. I will make the difference. Everyone can make the difference. We need to take care about the amount of waste dropped inside the oceans.</p>
<p>My first biketrip was in Northeast Brazil. When I heard several stories that identified myself and led me to decide go chasing my dreams and don't delay them anymore, I am responsible for making this happen. That is when I decided to quit my job and I started planning this project.</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p><span>For more than 10 years, the Sierra Student Coalition’s Summer Training Program (SPROG) has been empowering young leaders with the tools they need to <em>start</em> movements, <em>run</em> campaigns and <em>create</em> the world they want to live in:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>We are the Northwest Regional SPROG team.</li>
<li>For one week this summer, youth will come together to learn, share, and devolop into the empowered leaders of tomorrow. </li>
<li>Participants learn how to work with the media, facilitate a meeting, recruit members to their cause, meet with decision makers, promote anti-oppression, and much more through fun interactive trainings.

</ul>
<p>Your contribution will go towards providing scholarships so that all youth who are interested can attend SPROG, no matter their financial circumstances. With your donation you will be investing in the soul of the youth climate movement.</p>
</div>
<h3>Funding Details</h3>
<ul>
<li>We are raising $2,000 ($1,000 online and $1,000 through events) to provide scholarships to participants to cover their tuition costs. The tuition covers lodging, food, and training materials, which is $350 per person.</li>

<p>Remember Hurricane Sandy?</p>
<p>You likely saw graphic footage of how badly it affected New York. What you might not know is that two days earlier, the same hurricane tore through Cuba destroying hundreds of thousands of homes and leaving three million people without gas, electricity, or water.</p>
<p>Alarmingly, scientists predict that hurricanes like Sandy will become bigger and more intense in the coming years due to increases in the ocean’s temperature.  It's just one of the many negative impacts of climate change that islands like Cuba must grapple with.</p>
<p>In Cuba, you see, climate change is not just two words that represent a remote concept.</p>
<h3><strong>For Cuba, climate change threatens to alter the make-up of everyday life. </strong></h3>
<p>And it’s not just hurricanes.  Dengue fever is on the rise.  Thousands of people from many communities must now be relocated due to sea level rises and coastal flooding.  Climactic changes are impacting almost every sector of the Cuban economy, from agriculture to the health and tourism sectors.</p>
<h2><strong>The Context</strong></h2>
<p>Cuba can do little to halt actual climate change. What it can do is be proactive in how to adapt.</p>
<p>Thus far, Cubans have had to be inventive<em>. </em>Despite severe limits on how NGOs can access international funds, many experimental and creative initiatives have sprung up around the country.</p>
<p>But great ideas and good intentions will not be enough.  There remains a general lack of education and awareness about climate change and its challenges amongst the Cuban people.  <strong>The various initiatives that are underway are not connected to one another in any meaningful way, and their knowledge is not being shared or scaled around the country. </strong></p>
<p>At this moment, no platform or space exists for collaboration among specialists, local governments and community leaders, all of whom are working to address this serious issue. Worse, many of the public policies that do exist regarding how to adapt to climate change have not encouraged civil participation at the community level.</p>
<p>More needs to be done.  </p>
<p><strong>There is a great opportunity to work, right now, to leverage the great work on climate change adaptation that is happening across Cuba.</strong>  There is an opportunity not only to ignite community -and especially youth- participation in tackling this challenge, but also to create a forum that can facilitate capacity building and learning between different stakeholders, a platform that creates opportunities for best practices on climate change adaptation to be shared widely across the country.</p>

<h2><strong>Our Solution</strong></h2>
<p>We are Gioel and Handy and we need your help.</p>
<p>Handy is an environmental activist from Cuba. He has a decade of experience working at the community level on environmental issues including climate change adaptation in Cuba. </p>
<p>Gioel is the Director of Recrear (<a href=""http://www.recrearinternational.org/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">www.recrearinternational.org</a>), an organization that works around the world to help young people become active agents in community development.</p>
<p>We met in Montreal as part of the <a href=""http://www.sauvescholars.org/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Sauvé Scholars</a> program and we want to bring our expertise together to take action to help Cuba adapt to climate change. </p>
<h3><strong>Our mission is to connect Cubans working on climate change adaptation, especially youth, to help them find and share solutions to this daunting problem.</strong></h3>
<h2><strong>Our Project</strong></h2>
<p>We have designed a project to collect the experiences and best practices of Cuban youth environmental leaders so that they can be documented, shared, and more easily implemented across the country at various community levels. </p>
<p>We plan to bring together a group of 50 activists with different expertise related to climate change from 13 communities including Havana, Santiago de Cuba, Varadero and others. </p>
<p><em>We will implement the project with several local partners, including universities and other organizations including:</em></p>

<p><strong>- Nationwide consultation</strong> (2 weekends): A group of 25 youth environmental leaders from all around Cuba will be reviewing and improving the work of the consulting team.  </p>
<h2><strong>The Impact</strong></h2>
<p>At its core, our project looks to provide young Cubans a space and platform to work together to develop climate change adaptation strategies and to bring knowledge and experience back to their communities.  The project will provide 50 young environmentalists robust educational training on climate change adaptation, project design and participatory techniques for community involvement.  </p>
<p>Our end goal is to design an easily accessible manual on climate change adaptation; one which documents all that was learned through the project.   The manual will be designed not only for environmental activists and specialists, but with the intent of bringing awareness to educators, government and other stakeholders about best practices and innovations, and which offers guidance on how to replicate and scale adaptation projects at a local and regional level.</p>
<p>We will also seek to use this project to establish a climate change adaptation network that includes young professionals, students and specialists. This will enhance the sustainability of the project and promote continued dialogue and collaboration among all those involved.</p>

<h3>With great thanks and appreciation,</h3>
<h3>Handy, Gioel and the Recrear Team</h3></div>","The Challenge
Remember Hurricane Sandy?
You likely saw graphic footage of how badly it affected New York. What you might not know is that two days earlier, the same hurricane tore through Cuba destroying hundreds of thousands of homes and leaving three million people without gas, electricity, or water.
Alarmingly, scientists predict that hurricanes like Sandy will become bigger and more intense in the coming years due to increases in the ocean’s temperature.  It's just one of the many negative impacts of climate change that islands like Cuba must grapple with.
In Cuba, you see, climate change is not just two words that represent a remote concept.
For Cuba, climate change threatens to alter the make-up of everyday life. 
And it’s not just hurricanes.  Dengue fever is on the rise.  Thousands of people from many communities must now be relocated due to sea level rises and coastal flooding.  Climactic changes are impacting almost every sector of the Cuban economy, from agriculture to the health and tourism sectors.
The Context
Cuba can do little to halt actual climate change. What it can do is be proactive in how to adapt.
Thus far, Cubans have had to be inventive. Despite severe limits on how NGOs can access international funds, many experimental and creative initiatives have sprung up around the country.
But great ideas and good intentions will not be enough.  There remains a general lack of education and awareness about climate change and its challenges amongst the Cuban people.  The various initiatives that are underway are not connected to one another in any meaningful way, and their knowledge is not being shared or scaled around the country. 
At this moment, no platform or space exists for collaboration among specialists, local governments and community leaders, all of whom are working to address this serious issue. Worse, many of the public policies that do exist regarding how to adapt to climate change have not encouraged civil participation at the community level.
More needs to be done.  
There is a great opportunity to work, right now, to leverage the great work on climate change adaptation that is happening across Cuba.  There is an opportunity not only to ignite community -and especially youth- participation in tackling this challenge, but also to create a forum that can facilitate capacity building and learning between different stakeholders, a platform that creates opportunities for best practices on climate change adaptation to be shared widely across the country.
 
Our Solution
We are Gioel and Handy and we need your help.
Handy is an environmental activist from Cuba. He has a decade of experience working at the community level on environmental issues including climate change adaptation in Cuba. 
Gioel is the Director of Recrear (www.recrearinternational.org), an organization that works around the world to help young people become active agents in community development.
We met in Montreal as part of the Sauvé Scholars program and we want to bring our expertise together to take action to help Cuba adapt to climate change.

We plan to bring together a group of 50 activists with different expertise related to climate change from 13 communities including Havana, Santiago de Cuba, Varadero and others. 
We will implement the project with several local partners, including universities and other organizations including:

<p>This Project involves and impacts every living thing on this planet!  I request that you start at this link where you can find out more about me, but more importantly this project and where it's heading.  We need your support to achieve our objectives.  Please start by taking a look at the information found on the following link: <a href=""http://contest.techbriefs.com/2013/entries/sustainable-technologies/by-views/3266-saving-the-honeybee-low-toxicity-integrated-pest-management-product"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://contest.techbriefs.com/2013/entries/sustainable-technologies/by-views/3266-saving-the-honeybee-low-toxicity-integrated-pest-management-product</a></p>
<p><strong>What We Need</strong> </p>
<p>We need $150,000 Dollars so that we undertake an intense Field Study of the LTIP product leading toward certification and marketing.  Funds will be used to pay stipends to our academic research teams (at two colleges) to do field research; to provide teams with new beekeeping equipment (Garments/gloves; Nuc's, Gum's, Super's, etc.); to expense the supply of filtered beeswax; to pay for machine time; to pay for the costs of state and Federal filing fees required to obtain certification so these can be sold in the USA and exported to global markets.  We will also set-aside 10% of all funds donated to establish an educational fund that will provide basic beekeeping equipment and learning materials (books, etc.) to inner-city school programs that provide classes in Beekeeping (i.e., the Loyola Urban Beekeeping Project, 4-H Clubs, and HOPE OFIRIHA developed Onura, Sudan).  Read more at <a href=""http://www.ehow.com/list_7516763_beekeeping-projects.html#ixzz2fe67WC23"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.ehow.com/list_7516763_beekeeping-projects.html#ixzz2fe67WC23</a>) and <a href=""http://www.ehow.com/list_7516763_beekeeping-projects.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.ehow.com/list_7516763_beekeeping-projects.html</a> . We are doing this because we believe that we must teach our children about this situation or there might not be enough food to feed them and their children in 10 or 20 years.</p>
<p>One of our goal's is to make the product less costly and easier to obtain than present beekeeper supplies and pesticides.  Our pricing structure will be based on the 'spot price' for filtered beeswax, and we will purchase at the time of year when the price of beeswax (from commercial sources, e.g., Dadant &amp; Sons Apiaries or Brushy  Mountain Bee Farms) is at the seasonal low.  The large chemical companies, that have unlimited financial resources, have a (literal) 'strangle-hold' on the apiculture industry (and agriculture, in general) and they are just too large and fiscally-powerful to engage them (or 'fight' them), directly.  </p>
<p>The only way to really impact the industry is to make a product that is <strong><em>'more eco-friendly, better and easier to use, and less expensive'</em></strong> than the products that Beekeeper's are 'forced' to use, today (e.g., bee cakes, bee strips, or powdered products).  And we have done that: Our tests prove it!  Take a look at a recent article I published in a leading, international scientific Journal regarding ""LTIP"" at: <a href=""http://www.rmannco.com/low-toxicity-ipm-products.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.rmannco.com/low-toxicity-ipm-products.html</a> and at Page 1. at <a href=""http://www.pluralidade.info/Eindex.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.pluralidade.info/Eindex.html</a> . The paper was peer-reviewed and was published by our colleagues in Brazil where Beekeeping is a billion-dollar industry.</p>

<p>We realize that we're attempting to raise a lot of money through donations.  In today's economy even colleges and universities are finding it difficult to raise money to support basic research, and we recognize the potential that we may not reach our funding goal.  But, even if we don't every dollar donated will go directly to support research and nothing else.  We can't and don't expect the researchers to work, <em>Pro Bono, </em>and new beekeeping supplies cost a lot of money.  So we're hoping that everyone who reads this information, and anyone who 'eats-food', will realize just how very, very important this project truly is and help us in one way or another. If everyone who reads about this issue and would donate just One Dollar, we'd reach our benchmark very quickly.  If you can't afford to donate, you can help in other ways, like, posting our link on your Facebook Wall, posting a news 'blurb' about the project to your Twitter-family/friends, your favorite Blog, or sharing news about us F2F with your friends, and even contacting us to 'get a story/interview' for an article you might be writing, or a school Science paper?  If you want to write a paper about this subject for a school or college class (extra-credit), Dr. Resnick would be happy to help you (just ask or contact him!).  Word-of-mouth is one of the best ways to help any good cause and you can help us that way, too!</p>

<p><strong>Project Impact</strong></p>
<p>Since 1996 Dr. Resnick has been concerned with onset of parasitic infestations in feral bee populations in the USA and has experimented with several methods aimed at addressing this problem.  Since 2006-2008 studies have identified a condition termed, ‘Colony Collapse Disporder’, in which parasitic infestation(s) play some role and have been determined to be a contributing factor in the decrease of domestic honey production and imparting negative impact to crop pollination/production, in<br/>general.  Our studies (above) have revealed that there are additional contributing factors that promulgate CCD and these are not found in any of the literature.</p>
<p>Studies, such as those found at <a href=""http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/br/ccd/ccd_actionplan.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/br/ccd/ccd_actionplan.pdf</a> and <a href=""http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/about/intheworks/honeybee.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/about/intheworks/honeybee.htm</a>,<br/>indicate that additional research is needed to better identify and define<br/>causes and develop potential remedies, while following recommended guidelines<br/>in the ARS’ Action Plan.  More recently, the USDA published this update<br/>which points out major concerns with efforts to save the Honeybee. I had<br/>no hand in authoring this paper, but, as you'll see...what the USDA is stating<br/>is needed to offer viable solutions to this problem, is precisely what I've<br/>developed, i.e., a new, sustainable/renewable way, and a low-toxicity pesticide<br/>that will destroy the varrowa mite...but not kill the honeybee...and that's<br/>exactly what I've done!!!  Read this report: <a href=""http://www.usda.gov/documents/ReportHoneyBeeHealth.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.usda.gov/documents/ReportHoneyBeeHealth.pdf</a> .</p>
<p>In 2012 Dr. Joe Resnick commenced efforts to produce next-generation treatment modalities utilizing a proprietary microencapsulation process and instrumentation, developed in cooperation with NASA/JPL-MSF and tested aboard STS-41 and STS-43, with objective toward advancement of an IPM (Integrated Pest Management) protocol designed to address the recalcitrant problem of parasitic infestation in bee<br/>colonies by the Varroa mite (<em>V. destructor</em>) and trachea mites.  Additional embodiments were considered with attention to developing second generation treatment methods for at least two aspects of colony collapse disorder (“CCD“), more specifically, Varroatosis, and infestations by the Parasitic Phorid Fly, <i>Apocephalus boreali. </i>The secondary consideration was to utilize Coumaphos (camphorated oil) as a possible adjuvant as opposed to Fluvalinate which has been found to be ineffective in ARS’s Phase II experimental paradigms.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>These efforts had clear objectives with defined goals being:</p>
<p>1.To identify, qualify/quantify, natural substances best suited for use in the creation of new products for use in the prevention/treatment of varroa mite infestation;</p>
<p>2.To create eco-friendly (natural) chemical countermeasures that comprise a low-toxicity delivery system and components;</p>
<p>3.To create next-generation products that are:</p>
<p>A. Highly effective;</p>
<p>B. Quick~Easy to use (deploy/apply/re-treat);</p>
<p>C. Capable of reducing stressors to individuals comprising the colony by making the product manufactures more readily-accessible with manufactures being made in sizes between 5um to 150um and with control of molecular polarity resulting<br/>in easier transport by worker bees.</p>
<p><strong>Field Trials in Progress</strong></p>
<p>We have three (3) field trials in progress where the 'LTIP' product is being evaluated by members of our research team.  The first project was commenced in June 2013 in Santa Rosa, CA by Mr. Sherman Hahs who is widely known in the Greater Santa Rosa Area as, 'The Bee Whisperer'.  Sherm operates an apiary at his farm in Santa Rosa and performs (emergency) bee/wasp removals in his 'spare time'. Sherm has used the product in 5 of out test-hives with outstanding outcomes.  A paper is planned for publication in which details of the study will be subjected to Peer Review prior to publication.  Here's photo of Sherm's Apiary in Santa Rosa.</p>

<p>Sherm's  initial studies undertaken on a small scale at a Beta Test Site located in Santa Rosa, California have shown promising results to date in terms of accomplishing the above goals.</p>
<p>We also have a project in place in Lenoir, NC where we are culturing next-generation Queen Bees.  The NC-study focuses on pre-treatment of the queen-breeder combs so that if the queen varroa mite lays an egg in the queen-egg cell-comb the egg is 'neutralized' by the eco-friendly pre-treatment method using the LTIP product.  Here's a photo of our project in NC.  Master Beekeeper, Mr. Dan Kirby, (shown holding one of the new queen-egg cell-combs in his left hand) who has been a member of the NC Beekeeper's Association for more than 60 years, has oversight of the project in NC('Thanks, Dan!').  Dr. Joe Resnick is shown below right completing final assembly of 2 'Nuc's' that Mr. Kirby is using to culture the new queen bee broods.</p>

<p>We have fellow beekeepers in China and India who are anxious to be able to obtain the new LTIP Products.  Although CCD has not spread to some regions in China and India, 'prevention' is the desired approach to preventing occurrence and spread of this syndrome.  Below are photographs of our colleague in India using his own 'Super' made from all natural (local) woods.  You'll notice that the Indian Bee Box looks nothing like those used in the Western World.  The photo of our Chinese colleagues shows how experienced Beekeepers can 'have fun' with their bees!</p>

<p><b>Risks and Challenges </b></p>
<p>I have made every effort toward minimizing the risks to success in completing this project. I have the time, expertise, equipment needed to produce the products for field testing, and have a Beta-tests site already in place where preliminary testing<br/>has proven successful. Mr. Sherman Hahs has reported that his initial application and use of the new L-Tip product has performed 'outstandingly' and that his bees are free of all mites of any kind. </p>
<p>The greatest 'challenge', as we see it, will be to move the product through the 'red-tape' commonly associated with getting a new 'pesticide' product into the market place and obtaining the requisite state and Federal approvals under existing laws that will enable me to do that. To that end I have taken extreme care to solicit the involvement and guidance from the appropriate state and Federal agencies and officials tasked with oversight of such products and will comply with all requirements necessary under ARS Guidelines enabling me to bring this product to market. </p>
<p>I don't think I'll have much trouble getting the necessary approvals, as the materials I'm using are natural, organic substances that are already in widespread use in the marketplace (this is called, ""Grandfathering"" or obtaining approvals under a 'Grandfather Clause'). To make my product I use 100% natural Beeswax to create the microcapsules (manufactures) that are about the same size as a grain of pollen which is easy for the bee/pollinator to carry back to the hive (reducing 'stressors'). The substances I use are available, worldwide, which can be purchased at just about<br/>every retail store in the Free World. The significance of what I am doing is to make the substances more readily-accessible to the Worker Bees by making the adjuvant 1) easier for the bee to carry back to the hive and to the place inside the hive (frames) where the honeycombs are built and into which the bees place nectar/pollen; 2) reduce the 'stressors' that worker bees experience when other kinds of (bee-cakes or wafer-strip type products) are used to treat the colony for diseases or infestations by mites/moths/flies. Read this article, which speaks exactly to the need to reduce stressors as being beneficial and helpful to the effort to save the honeybee: <a href=""http://www.usda.gov/documents/ReportHoneyBeeHealth.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.usda.gov/documents/ReportHoneyBeeHealth.pdf</a></p>
<p>I truly don't anticipate any problems in registering this product with the USDA, as,<br/>'technically', I could take the product to market...today (if I had the funding to do so)! The product is common beeswax and an essential oil that anyone can purchase anywhere on the planet.  Again, what makes this product so different and unique is how I create it and make the manufactures comprising the product and how I put the active ingredient(s) inside the microcapsule: That's what 'separates the wheat from the chaff'.  When I do this the result is a product (microsphere-containing adjuvant) that is absolutely 'unique' and has never been used before as a method of treating parasite infestations in pollinators.</p>

Project Impact
Since 1996 Dr. Resnick has been concerned with onset of parasitic infestations in feral bee populations in the USA and has experimented with several methods aimed at addressing this problem.  Since 2006-2008 studies have identified a condition termed, ‘Colony Collapse Disporder’, in which parasitic infestation(s) play some role and have been determined to be a contributing factor in the decrease of domestic honey production and imparting negative impact to crop pollination/production, ingeneral.  Our studies (above) have revealed that there are additional contributing factors that promulgate CCD and these are not found in any of the literature.
Studies, such as those found at http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/br/ccd/ccd_actionplan.pdf and http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/about/intheworks/honeybee.htm,indicate that additional research is needed to better identify and definecauses and develop potential remedies, while following recommended guidelinesin the ARS’ Action Plan.  More recently, the USDA published this updatewhich points out major concerns with efforts to save the Honeybee. I hadno hand in authoring this paper, but, as you'll see...what the USDA is statingis needed to offer viable solutions to this problem, is precisely what I'vedeveloped, i.e., a new, sustainable/renewable way, and a low-toxicity pesticidethat will destroy the varrowa mite...but not kill the honeybee...and that'sexactly what I've done!!!  Read this report: http://www.usda.gov/documents/ReportHoneyBeeHealth.pdf .
In 2012 Dr. Joe Resnick commenced efforts to produce next-generation treatment modalities utilizing a proprietary microencapsulation process and instrumentation, developed in cooperation with NASA/JPL-MSF and tested aboard STS-41 and STS-43, with objective toward advancement of an IPM (Integrated Pest Management) protocol designed to address the recalcitrant problem of parasitic infestation in beecolonies by the Varroa mite (V. destructor) and trachea mites.  Additional embodiments were considered with attention to developing second generation treatment methods for at least two aspects of colony collapse disorder (“CCD“), more specifically, Varroatosis, and infestations by the Parasitic Phorid Fly, Apocephalus boreali. The secondary consideration was to utilize Coumaphos (camphorated oil) as a possible adjuvant as opposed to Fluvalinate which has been found to be ineffective in ARS’s Phase II experimental paradigms.
 
These efforts had clear objectives with defined goals being:
1.To identify, qualify/quantify, natural substances best suited for use in the creation of new products for use in the prevention/treatment of varroa mite infestation;
2.To create eco-friendly (natural) chemical countermeasures that comprise a low-toxicity delivery system and components;
3.To create next-generation products that are:
A. Highly effective;
B. Quick~Easy to use (deploy/apply/re-treat);
C. Capable of reducing stressors to individuals comprising the colony by making the product manufactures more readily-accessible with manufactures being made in sizes between 5um to 150um and with control of molecular polarity resultingin easier transport by worker bees.
Field Trials in Progress
We have three (3) field trials in progress where the 'LTIP' product is being evaluated by members of our research team.  The first project was commenced in June 2013 in Santa Rosa, CA by Mr. Sherman Hahs who is widely known in the Greater Santa Rosa Area as, 'The Bee Whisperer'.  Sherm operates an apiary at his farm in Santa Rosa and performs (emergency) bee/wasp removals in his 'spare time'. Sherm has used the product in 5 of out test-hives with outstanding outcomes.  A paper is planned for publication in which details of the study will be subjected to Peer Review prior to publication.  Here's photo of Sherm's Apiary in Santa Rosa.
 
                     
Sherm's  initial studies undertaken on a small scale at a Beta Test Site located in Santa Rosa, California have shown promising results to date in terms of accomplishing the above goals.
We also have a project in place in Lenoir, NC where we are culturing next-generation Queen Bees.  The NC-study focuses on pre-treatment of the queen-breeder combs so that if the queen varroa mite lays an egg in the queen-egg cell-comb the egg is 'neutralized' by the eco-friendly pre-treatment method using the LTIP product.  Here's a photo of our project in NC.  Master Beekeeper, Mr. Dan Kirby, (shown holding one of the new queen-egg cell-combs in his left hand) who has been a member of the NC Beekeeper's Association for more than 60 years, has oversight of the project in NC('Thanks, Dan!').  Dr. Joe Resnick is shown below right completing final assembly of 2 'Nuc's' that Mr. Kirby is using to culture the new queen bee broods.
           
      
We have fellow beekeepers in China and India who are anxious to be able to obtain the new LTIP Products.  Although CCD has not spread to some regions in China and India, 'prevention' is the desired approach to preventing occurrence and spread of this syndrome.  Below are photographs of our colleague in India using his own 'Super' made from all natural (local) woods.  You'll notice that the Indian Bee Box looks nothing like those used in the Western World.  The photo of our Chinese colleagues shows how experienced Beekeepers can 'have fun' with their bees!
  
Risks and Challenges 
I have made every effort toward minimizing the risks to success in completing this project. I have the time, expertise, equipment needed to produce the products for field testing, and have a Beta-tests site already in place where preliminary testinghas proven successful. Mr. Sherman Hahs has reported that his initial application and use of the new L-Tip product has performed 'outstandingly' and that his bees are free of all mites of any kind. 
The greatest 'challenge', as we see it, will be to move the product through the 'red-tape' commonly associated with getting a new 'pesticide' product into the market place and obtaining the requisite state and Federal approvals under existing laws that will enable me to do that. To that end I have taken extreme care to solicit the involvement and guidance from the appropriate state and Federal agencies and officials tasked with oversight of such products and will comply with all requirements necessary under ARS Guidelines enabling me to bring this product to market. 
I don't think I'll have much trouble getting the necessary approvals, as the materials I'm using are natural, organic substances that are already in widespread use in the marketplace (this is called, ""Grandfathering"" or obtaining approvals under a 'Grandfather Clause'). To make my product I use 100% natural Beeswax to create the microcapsules (manufactures) that are about the same size as a grain of pollen which is easy for the bee/pollinator to carry back to the hive (reducing 'stressors'). The substances I use are available, worldwide, which can be purchased at just aboutevery retail store in the Free World. The significance of what I am doing is to make the substances more readily-accessible to the Worker Bees by making the adjuvant 1) easier for the bee to carry back to the hive and to the place inside the hive (frames) where the honeycombs are built and into which the bees place nectar/pollen; 2) reduce the 'stressors' that worker bees experience when other kinds of (bee-cakes or wafer-strip type products) are used to treat the colony for diseases or infestations by mites/moths/flies. Read this article, which speaks exactly to the need to reduce stressors as being beneficial and helpful to the effort to save the honeybee: http://www.usda.gov/documents/ReportHoneyBeeHealth.pdf
I truly don't anticipate any problems in registering this product with the USDA, as,'technically', I could take the product to market...today (if I had the funding to do so)! The product is common beeswax and an essential oil that anyone can purchase anywhere on the planet.  Again, what makes this product so different and unique is how I create it and make the manufactures comprising the product and how I put the active ingredient(s) inside the microcapsule: That's what 'separates the wheat from the chaff'.  When I do this the result is a product (microsphere-containing adjuvant) that is absolutely 'unique' and has never been used before as a method of treating parasite infestations in pollinators.

<p class=""Default"">The Continental Divide Trail (CDT) needs you.  This campaign is a focused crowd sourcing effort to rally outdoor and environmental communities across the country towards supporting the future of this incredible national scenic trail.  Federal funds for land preservation are slowly being restricted due to sequestration and federal spending cuts. The trail corridor and its preservation is falling through the cracks, and is facing great capacity difficulties in maintaining what so many have worked so hard to build.  Dollars from this campaign will directly support much needed advocacy and protection efforts, map making, data collection, and volunteer trail building.</p>

<h3 class=""Default""><strong>What is The Continental Divide National Scenic Trail (CDT)?  </strong></h3>
<p class=""Default"">The CDT is one of the most significant trail systems in the world, spanning 3,100 miles from Canada to Mexico. In 1978, Congress established a 50-mile wide corridor on either side of the geographic Continental Divide in which to build the CDT.  The CDT connects countless communities along its spine across Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado and New Mexico traversing three national parks, one national monument, 25 national forests, and eight BLM areas.  It is one of the three National Scenic Trails belonging to the ‘Triple Crown’ (along with Pacific Crest Trail and Appalachian Trail) and is typically noted within the thru-hiking community as being the highest and wildest. </p>

<p class=""Default""><strong>Who is the Continental Divide Trail Coaltion (CDTC): </strong></p>
<p class=""Default"">CDTC formed to establish strong community-based relationships through activities that support the construction, maintenance and support of the CDT. The organization feels that cultivating local relationships with communities adjacent to the Trail and involving volunteers on the ground is the most powerful way to build our movement and preserve and protect the CDT.  Through these networks of individuals, groups, and local communities, we will build a strong and healthy voice for the CDT that will help promote the vision for the CDT and ensure it remains a national landmark for generations to come.</p>
<p class=""Default""><strong>Plans for 2014:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class=""Default"">Maintenence of 300 miles of CDT in Colorado</li>

<div> </div></div>","Why the Campaign?  
The Continental Divide Trail (CDT) needs you.  This campaign is a focused crowd sourcing effort to rally outdoor and environmental communities across the country towards supporting the future of this incredible national scenic trail.  Federal funds for land preservation are slowly being restricted due to sequestration and federal spending cuts. The trail corridor and its preservation is falling through the cracks, and is facing great capacity difficulties in maintaining what so many have worked so hard to build.  Dollars from this campaign will directly support much needed advocacy and protection efforts, map making, data collection, and volunteer trail building.

From 1995 to early 2012, the primary supporter of the Continental Divide Trail was the Continental Divide Trail Alliance (CDTA).  The CDTA ceased operations in January of 2012, leaving a large gap in trail stewardship, advocacy and support.  Passionate trail management professionals and volunteers have made it their mission to continue building and sustaining the CDT through this new organization, the Continental Divide Trail Coalition (CDTC).
CDT Gap Map
Take a look at this map of the areas where the CDT remains unprotected and vulnerable. Nearly 30% still needs us to finish the job and not let this nationally significant experience falter under our watch.

Urgency to Support the CDT: 

While 72% of the Trail is complete, there are still 800 miles in need of construction, reconstruction to national trail standards, moved off of roads, or managed to meet standards of a National Scenic Trail
There are still 200 plus miles of the CDT on Roads with major sections in the Carson National Forest in New Mexico and the Muddy Pass area of Colorado


The Forest Service Budget is shrinking (17% in 2013 ) and this is impacting how the Trail is managed and supported by the Agency.  There needs to be, a voice advocating for this not to happen to say it is worth public funds to keep the progress moving forward on the CDT

There are numerous threats around  the Trail Corridor due to energy projects such as powerlines and wind farms in view from the Trail Corridor or other activity such as clear cuts or open-pit mines that have potential to negatively impact the Trail Experience

The cost of completion for the CDT including land acquisition, trail construction and management activity are estimated at $27 million dollars


Deteriorating Trail conditions need our attention including replacing infrastructure like bridges on dangerous river/stream crossings and potential loss of the maintained route

The need for a free informational map of the CDT with information about its protection, partners and uses, is needed all along the Trail. We have the map, now we need the text




There are threats of losing protection for all headwaters in the United States which start on the Continental Divide due to loss of Trail Corridor protection which will affect all downstream drinking water for all U.S. citizens

<li>
<strong>Bogdan Fedeles</strong>: is a research scientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in the department of Biological Engineering and Center for Environmental Health Sciences (CEHS), working in the lab of the CEHS director Dr. John Essigmann. The overarching goal of Dr. Fedeles’ research is to develop a unified framework for decoding the mutational records of cells, which would enable early cancer diagnosis, better exposure risk assessment and insights into disease etiology. To study mutagenesis, Dr. Fedeles utilizes a multidisciplinary approach, which includes biological chemistry to construct site-specific nucleic acid lesions and analogs, chemical and spectroscopic tools to study lesion biochemistry, and molecular biology and genetics experiments to assess the contribution of the genetic background to mutagenic outcomes. His current work investigates the mutagenic consequences of inflammation, and their contribution to the mutational burden observed in many inflammation-dependent human cancers. </li>
<li>
<strong>Ludmil Alexandrov</strong>: completed his PhD in 2014 at the University of Cambridge and since then he has been an Oppenheimer Fellow in Theoretical Biology at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Ludmil’s research has been focused on understanding the mutational processes in human cancer through the use of mutational signatures. Ludmil developed the first comprehensive map of mutational signatures in human cancer and demonstrated the applicability of mutational signatures to cancer prevention and cancer treatment. Ludmil has more than 55 publications in well-respected scientific journals and he has won multiple awards for his work on mutational signatures, including:  listed as “30 brightest stars under the age of 30” by Forbes magazine; a Harold M. Weintraub Award by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center; Prize for Young Scientists in Genomics and Proteomics by Science magazine; Carcinogenesis Young Investigator Award by European Association for Cancer Research. Ludmil is currently one of six co-investigators leading the Mutographs of cancer, a project that seeks to understand the unknown cancer-causing factors across the globe by examining mutational signatures from 5,000 cancer patients from 17 countries across five continents.</li>

<strong>Nikolai Chepelev</strong>: has developed strong and diverse expertise in toxicogenomics during postdoctoral training at the Genomics Laboratory of Health Canada, led by Dr. Carole Yauk. For this work, he has received three awards: two from Risk Assessment Specialty Section of the Society of Toxicology (e.g., Best Published Paper Advancing the Science of Risk Assessment - 2015) and one from the Environmental and Molecular Mutagenesis (EMM; New Investigator Best Paper Award - 2016). Nikolai showed how toxicogenomics can benefit health risk assessment by providing mechanistic information to explain neurotoxicity and carcinogenicity of benzo[a]pyrene as an example. He has recently joined Genetic Toxicology Laboratory at Health Canada (Leader - Dr. Paul White), where he is applying both traditional toxicity tests (bacterial mutagenicity and transgene mutation assays) and toxicogenomics. His goal is to develop high-throughput platform for in vitro Genetic Toxicity Assessment of chemicals that will rely on both traditional and emerging technologies.

Qu'est-ce que TerraVie?


TerraVie est un
organisme de conservation sans but lucratif et une œuvre de bienfaisance qui a
pour mission de démontrer à
l’aide d’exemples concrets qu’une intégration harmonieuse des activités
humaines avec l’environnement naturel est possible. Nos deux principales activités sont donc la protection à perpétuité des milieux naturels et la réalisation à proximité de projets écologiques respectueux de l’environnement, tels l’habitation écologique, des éco-gites verts, des aménagements botaniques et d’écotourisme. Le troisième volet de l’action de TerraVie qui complète sa mission est l’éducation environnementale. Ce concept global a mérité le prix Phénix de l’environnement en 2007 dans la catégorie « développement durable ».


Ce que nous avons déjà accompli



En 2006, grâce d’une part à un programme gouvernemental et, d’autre part, aux efforts de financement d’une équipe de bénévoles, TerraVie a acquis un terrain de 288 acres dans la municipalité de Montcalm, dans la MRC des Laurentides. Depuis, ce terrain a fait l’objet de nombreux aménagements et de constructions créatives

Depuis son acquisition,
la majeure partie du terrain a d’abord été constituée en aire protégée et ensuite
en Réserve naturelle du Lac-du-Brochet protégeant à perpétuité de nombreuses
espèces vulnérables. Pour pouvoir ouvrir officiellement ce site au public,
TerraVie doit développer écologiquement des aménagements récréatifs et
éducatifs et des installations écotouristiques.  

Notre équipe de
bénévoles a déjà entamé les aménagements du centre d’accueil situé dans la
réserve naturelle comprenant : une passerelle d’accès, 600 mètres d’un
sentier pédestre accessible aux visiteurs en fauteuils roulants, des affiches signalétiques, un cabanon, des toilettes
à compost dont une pour les personnes à mobilité réduite, un abri vert éducatif
démontrant diverses techniques de construction écologique, un jardin de plantes indigènes et le début de l’aménagement
de plusieurs kilomètres de sentiers en forêt.


De plus, une yourte traditionnelle
de Mongolie est installée dans la section du grand jardin communautaire dont les bassins d’eau sont irrigués par une pompe bélier.
Un four à pain en argile y a
été monté lors d’ateliers éducatifs.
La fréquentation du lac est facilitée grâce à des quais installés aux trois différents points d'accès.

Actuellement, nous travaillons sur la construction de notre premier bâtiment permanent, le Centre d’interprétation de la nature, pour lequel nous sollicitons votre aide. 


L’objectif de cette
campagne : construction du Centre d’interprétation de la nature 



Le Centre
d'interprétation de la nature à l'entrée de la zone d'accueil de notre réserve
naturelle sera un lieu de rassemblement pour les visiteurs ainsi qu’un centre
éducatif sur l’environnement et le développement durable où seront présentés des
formations, des ateliers, des conférences, des expositions artistiques ainsi que des évènements thématiques incluant la vente de produits et services divers. (Pour plus de détails sur les activités éducatives de TerraVie, veuillez suivre le lien suivant www.terravie.org ). Le Centre contiendra un petit cinéma des bois, une bibliothèque verte et une terrasse de dégustation de produits de la forêt.
Le bâtiment du Centre
de la nature est conçu selon les principes des 3RV : réduction, réemploi, recyclage et
valorisation.
Il servira
de modèle de construction écologique. Il comprendra différents systèmes intégrés :
système de recyclage des eaux grises par les plantes, gestion de l’eau de pluie, pompage de
l'eau du lac à l’aide
de vélos, « Rocket
Stove » et poêle à bois pour le chauffage et la cuisson, système
d'énergie solaire, etc.  En mettant de
l’avant des approches et des
technologies écologiques innovatrices qui sont à la portée de tous, TerraVie veut
démontrer qu’il est possible d’intégrer des infrastructures publiques en nature
en réduisant considérablement notre empreinte écologique.

En somme, par cette initiative, nous souhaitons:

permettre aux gens d’accéder aux milieux naturels
tant pour des fins récréatives qu’éducatives
les inspirer à adopter les
technologies vertes assurant la santé des écosystèmes et des collectivités présentes et futures
et collaborer aux activités de revitalisation des petits villages avoisinants.




Voici une liste des
activités envisagées du Centre : 

Accueil des visiteurs et
renseignements, vente de produits (cartes du site, fiches éducatives, articles promotionnels, etc.), visites guidées;
Exposition en images des
essences d’arbres et des espèces d’animaux de la réserve; 
Sensibilisation du public aux habitudes et aux actions écologique grâce à des conférences et ateliers divers;
Projection de films
traitant des questions environnementales;
Organisation d’évènements
de célébration et de campagnes de financement divers; 
Création d’une
bibliothèque sur divers sujets concernant la protection de l’environnement et
les alternatives en construction et en énergie; 

Location du lieu pour différentes sessions prolongées de thérapie ou d’art en nature (yoga, Qigong, musique, peinture, sculpture, photographie, etc.) en lien avec les futurs éco-gîtes.

Atelier de crépi à la chaux





Avancement du projet et votre support 

 
À
l’heure actuelle, ont déjà été réalisés : les piliers de fondation, la
charpente, les murs extérieurs, la toiture et l’isolation du toit, certaines
fenêtres et portes, quelques panneaux solaires, le tableau de contrôle électrique,
le plancher pour l’installation du « Rocket stove » 
Nous avons besoin de
votre support pour parachever
le bâtiment, ce qui veut dire les matériaux pour :

l’isolation à la
cellulose des murs,
la finition  des murs
intérieurs,
certaines fenêtres/portes,
le revêtement des planchers,
l’escalier
intérieur,
tous les aménagements intérieurs et le système de chauffage,
les batteries, 
la
finalisation des installations électriques avec l’éclairage aux DEL,
la
terrasse,
la récupération de l’eau de pluie,
un chauffe-air solaire,
la chambre
mécanique, etc….

Les
bénévoles sont bienvenus.L’argent reçu servira à acheter ces matériaux et à assurer ses
installations.

Le ministère  québécois des Affaires municipales et de l'Occupation du territoire versera, dans le cadre du Programme d'infrastructures en entrepreneuriat collectif (PIEC), l'équivalent de 30 % du montant amassé sur Indiegogo.

Notre objectif est d’inaugurer le bâtiment le Jour de l’an 2015.D'autres façons d'aider


Nous
vous remercions grandement et nous vous invitons à parler de ce projet avec vos amis et votre
famille.
Au
plaisir de vous voir en ce lieu que l’on crée tous ensemble.



What is TerraVie
?


TerraVie is a community land trust, a non-profit charity organization and a land conservancy whose
mission is to show with concrete
examples, that harmony can be achieved between human activities and nature. Our two main activities are the preservation
of the natural area, and the realization
of local environmental
projects, such as ecological
housing, eco-gites, botanical gardens and ecotourism. The third
element in TerraVie’s action plan which also fulfills their mission, is environmental education. This initiative
earned them the Phoenix prize for the environment in
2007, under the catagory of ""sustainable development"".




What we have already achieved 





In 2006, with the help of a government funding program, and through the fundraising efforts of a team of volunteers, TerraVie acquired 288 acres
of land in the Municipality of Montcalm, in the MRC des Laurentides. Since then, this land has undergone numerous modifications and innovative constructions.


Since its acquisition, most of the land has been located
within the Lac du Brochet nature reserve, where many endangered species will be
protected forever. In order to officially open this site to the public, TerraVie will develop ecological recreational, educational and ecotourism facilities.
  


Within the reserve, our team of volunteers has already begun the construction of a
visitors center as well as a foot
bridge, 600 meters of a
wheelchair accessible walking trail, information posters, a shed, composting
toilets--
one of which is accessible for the handicapped,
an educational “green” shelter showing various
ecological building techniques, a
native plant garden and the beginning of
several kilometers of forest trails. 



A traditional Mongolian yurt was also installed near the large community garden, which is equipped with water basins supplied by a ram pump. A clay bread oven was built during one of the educational workshops, and there are three docks giving access to the lake.

Currently, we are working on our first substantial building, the Nature Interpretation Center, and we need your help

<p>Our team origins are at University of Sheffield.  We'd all worked at Danum previously, and we all knew what a special place it was. The forest here has been evolving for 130 million years. It teems with life: orang-utans, clouded leopards, gibbons, slow loris, linsang, giant pythons, crazy insects, countless spectacular birds, and the last of the Bornean banteng, pygmy elephants, and Sumatran rhinos. </p>

<p>With so little forest left, the question of whether logged forest can recover to the point where it supports the original intricate and complex faunal communities is vital.  If we can demonstrate the value of naturally regenerating forest, we can advocate for its protection.  That's what our study does.</p>

<p>Birds are our study taxon.  They are ideal for this: well understood; sensitive to ecological impacts and so good barometers of change; and they are commonly used as indicators of biodiversity, so we can use them in this way as well.

For now, we get by on volunteerism and donations.  Your donations are needed to cover lodging and food (bought on the cheap at the local markets), pay the field centre fees (which help keep the field centre afloat), cover vehicle costs, and hire the occasional local assistant to help with the dirty work.  We are always in need of gear (nets are covered by other grants, but we often must replace poles, rope, pliers, pisolas, clipboards, rulers, calipers, and other field tools).  We are always just one elephant herd away from total destruction of our set-up!  The van to town to get food is quite costly (and no one ever wants to leave work to go!), but vital.  I'd love to cover in-country flights for the research assistants as well, if I can. </p>

<p>To thank you, we are very happy to offer our fantastic perks - they are all beautiful Bornean handicrafts!  See a few of them below.  We'll try to get the exact items listed, but it depends on availability. You can email me with preferences if you like (don't be shy!).</p>

</div></div>","The Borneo Rainforest Project




Twenty years ago, as a budding biologist, I had the privilege of working in Danum Valley, north Borneo. What I found there was the most incredible, magnificent Disneyland of wildlife imaginable. For the next two decades, Danum Valley remained in my mind, and all I wanted was to return and experience it again.  When I finally got the chance, I was struck by the landscape of devastation I saw as I flew over the island.  My goal became to find a way to contribute to the conservation of this unique area.  I went to Danum Valley Field Centre (DVFC), tracked down other biologists who shared my vision, and we teamed up to form the Borneo Rainforest Project.
Our team origins are at University of Sheffield.  We'd all worked at Danum previously, and we all knew what a special place it was. The forest here has been evolving for 130 million years. It teems with life: orang-utans, clouded leopards, gibbons, slow loris, linsang, giant pythons, crazy insects, countless spectacular birds, and the last of the Bornean banteng, pygmy elephants, and Sumatran rhinos. 
  
So ancient and so fragile, the forests of Borneo have been logged and cleared for palm oil plantations at an alarming rate, leaving
less than an estimated 20,000 km2 of intact, unlogged forest. 
With so little forest left, the question of whether logged forest can recover to the point where it supports the original intricate and complex faunal communities is vital.  If we can demonstrate the value of naturally regenerating forest, we can advocate for its protection.  That's what our study does.

  
Birds are our study taxon.  They are ideal for this: well understood; sensitive to ecological impacts and so good barometers of change; and they are commonly used as indicators of biodiversity, so we can use them in this way as well. Our dedicated team of ornithologists and behavioral ecologists shares a passion for the work, for the birds, and for the rainforest.   How We're Funded and What Your Donations Do We have a small equipment grant from Idea Wild and have applied for other small grants, and the University of Sheffield supports some of our research assistants. Once we have about 5 years of data, we hope to obtain a large grant for the final 5 years. For now, we get by on volunteerism and donations.  Your donations are needed to cover lodging and food (bought on the cheap at the local markets), pay the field centre fees (which help keep the field centre afloat), cover vehicle costs, and hire the occasional local assistant to help with the dirty work.  We are always in need of gear (nets are covered by other grants, but we often must replace poles, rope, pliers, pisolas, clipboards, rulers, calipers, and other field tools).  We are always just one elephant herd away from total destruction of our set-up!  The van to town to get food is quite costly (and no one ever wants to leave work to go!), but vital.  I'd love to cover in-country flights for the research assistants as well, if I can. 


Our wish list includes a new field camera, since I pretty much drove my personal camera to an early grave with overuse, and a field laptop (again, my personal one gave out shortly after last season). These are absolutely necessary for recording morphological features, identification and documentation purposes, and of course data management.
Our one-year total budget for accommodation, food, gear, station fees,  all travel, local assistants, and vehicle costs (with 5 research assistants) is about $20,000.  That's the actual cost to run the project with no salaries but all expenses covered.  For now, we're still depending on volunteers for the bulk of it and asking for your help in covering some of the necessities.  If we can bring in more than our goal, I will be able to cover more of our expenses and equipment.  If we bring in less, well... the show must go on, so we'll hold bake sales, busk (if only we had talent), or plant a money tree.  We are always applying for grants along the way, of course, and everyone on the team contributes what they can.  Please help us exceed our goal!
To thank you, we are very happy to offer our fantastic perks - they are all beautiful Bornean handicrafts!  See a few of them below.  We'll try to get the exact items listed, but it depends on availability. You can email me with preferences if you like (don't be shy!).



 
 

  
     
The Impact - Your Contribution to Conservation
 
The
quantification of bird community responses to logging impacts and the
measurement of observable changes within logged forest as it regenerates will
help to define the role of Bornean logged forest in sustaining avian species
richness and diversity. Thus, the results of this study will bring to light the
potential value and contribution of regenerating logged forest to overall
biodiversity. 
Presently,
conversion of both primary and logged forest to low biodiversity habitats such as oil palm plantations continues at high rates. By determining both the importance of primary
forest reserves and the retained value of regenerating logged forest, this work
aims to promote consideration of all forest values in land use decision making. Land use and conservation actions taken in response to this
work will benefit all native forest species, beyond the taxon we address here.


  
Finally,
by employing and training local assistants and students, this work strives to
foster both a sense of stewardship and the talent and knowledge to perform
ongoing forest conservation work in the local community.  The local assistants hold permanent positions
at DVFC and
will have future opportunities to pursue ecological projects on site, and to
share their knowledge and experience with the many students and other visitors
that come to the Centre for courses and training.

A little bit of heaven that sits on a small and winding swamp road on Provincially Significant Wetlands butting on the Magnetawan River is up for grabs.SO WHAT HAPPENED?Here's the run down in very general terms...Mega Quarry Application is submitted to Ryerson Council.Mega Quarry Application is turned down by Ryerson Council.Mega Quarry Application is resubmitted with some ConcessionsMega Quarry Application is approved with some Conditions.The Proponent (Quarry Applicant) doesn't like the Conditions.The Residents in the mountain district don't like the Conditions.In order to solve this quandary, the only thing to do is to take the disagreements to the Ontario Municipal Board (OMB) to contest what is now called bylaw 31-13 – the bylaw put into place by Ryerson Council in order to make way for the quarry.So off go multiple parties to the OMB, including the Pegg's Mountain Group.WHY DID THIS HAPPEN?Information meeting July 2012 re: proposed quarry on Pegg's Mountain. Despite being a tiny township the room was full - and 'we the people' were clear on our position - we didn't want it then and we don't want it now! The Applicant's position looks clear – he wants conditions that are going to net him the most cash from his quarry operation.Ryerson Council's position is not really clear – they were found guilty of holding unnecessarily private meetings with the applicant twice by the Ombudsman according to the Sunshine Law (which is a big deal, but unfortunately holds no penalty) and refused to allow members of Pegg's Mountain Group or other parties to be 'in the loop' on communications and developments. (note: anyone is allowed access to public files at the Ryerson Township Office – it is not at all the same as being 'on board' and notified real time for information purposes.)They also refused (literally – we asked them many times and the answer was straight out ""no"") to require the Applicant to Commission Independent Studies in the areas where expertise was required in order to make an educated decision. These studies are a logical and every day requirement in these types of proceedings – the Applicant pays.These studies would examine in detail exactly the potential impact on the environment and local residents such as hydrology (water), road, blasting, noise and dust – including something called silica which is commonly found in granite (the stone that will be quarried).Why the heck not you may ask?So did we?Many times.We still don't know...PEGG'S MOUNTAIN GROUP - LEFT HOLDING THE BAGGYThe Road To Pegg's Mountain...Our own Ryerson Council has put us in the position of paying high legal fees to stop the quarry that they paved the way for.Had the township done their duty to protect the residents and environment of Ryerson Township and turned down the quarry, they would likely still be going to the OMB, but it would not be at the additional cost and time of ordinary private residents – which it has turned out to be.Hence, the Indiegogo Campaign.We need your help.HERE'S WHERE THE TRI AXLE GRAVEL TRUCK RUBBER MEETS THE ROADThis is the road that we will be expected to share with tri axle gravel trucks making up to 90 trips per day - bikers, walkers, horsebaack riders, joggers included.The Concessions made by the Applicant in his second attempt do not cover all of the original Concerns put forth by council.The Conditions put forth by council in Bylaw 31-13 Do Not Guarantee Protection of The Mountain, the River or the People Who Live There, both as permanent residents and seasonal.Nor Do They Protect the Tourism Industry That Supports The Town of Burk's Falls and Surrounding Townships.So...WE THE PEGG'S MOUNTAIN GROUP...Have taken it upon ourselves to try and make both parties accountable to all of the above potential travesties, and to try to pull together the people who are affected, of which there are two groups.1. Local residents and seasonal residents and visitors.2. The people, which may include you, who are affected every time a debacle of this sort is allowed to play out.This is your chance to help us do something about it.CONTRIBUTEWe often see Contribute as just a word.To Contribute is more than just an action – it's a feeling.How Does It Feel to Contribute to Preserving a Place Like Pegg's Mountain?How does it feel to pass it over?Too many times we find the answer to these kinds of questions too late.By making your contribution, you will be directly helping us to achieve the next essential step to preserve Pegg's Mountain and everything around it.This is the kind of ripple that can resound throughout the world.We would love for you to be a part of it.WHAT WE HAVE SO FARWe already have raised $17,287.95 over the past year.This amount has come from a very small number of extremely dedicated people who believe strongly in our case – and in protecting our environment, our people and our wildlife.These generous donations have paid for about 2/3's of the total costs associated with the pre-hearing. We are almost there!Without participation in the pre-hearing, we cannot participate in the hearing, when the judge will rule for or against the approved bylaw, which allows the quarry if the proponent decides to adhere to the conditions.And the fact is that he has not agreed. He is also taking Ryerson Council to the OMB to protest these conditions.In our eyes this makes our presence even more necessary.If no one is there to present all information pertinent to dismissal of the decision for bylaw approval – his chances will go up exponentially - which could result in his proceeding with the quarry unhindered by conditions at all.WHAT ABOUT RYERSON COUNCIL?You may be asking yourself why we need to be present at a hearing if 'our' Ryerson Council will be represented.That is exactly the reason. Ryerson Council will be in defense of their decision to approve the bylaw allowing the quarry with conditions – they will not be in defense of turning down permission to amend the bylaw to prevent the quarry – far contrary.We personally did not find Ryerson Council as a group to be friendly to the views or input of the Pegg's Mountain Group, so we highly do not expect to see any concessions made by them at the hearing in favour of pulling support from bylaw 31-13 which has already been passed on the vote of the Reeve Glen Miller and every council member except one who had the courage to stand up - George Sterling.NO GUARANTEESIn the end, really there can be no guarantees.And non have been given.

Where would you live? Would it be a comfy city apartment or a family house in the suburbs? Could you afford to send your kids to university?</p><p>If you were like heroes of our story, most of the answers would wrench your heart. The estimated 1.5 million waste-pickers in India are some of the world’s most marginalized people. These waste pickers, many of them women, often live below the poverty line, work in appalling conditions and are shunned by society. Yet they form a critical line of defence in stopping plastic from entering our rivers and oceans.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560934465/hjgejsnqh8dsmdgifibh.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><strong>Hope in the trash</strong></p><p>The global plastic pollution has given rise to an informal waste picking economy. Waste-pickers see the plastic as a valuable resource that can be collected and sold. Plastics For Change has developed a marketplace platform that connects waste-pickers with global brands and creates transparency through the supply chain. Our platform mobilizes thousands of waste-pickers to collect plastic that pollutes the environment. We provide a consistent supply of high quality recycled plastic for industry partners.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560417055/jv4vmhvmn3en7ri5ak6e.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><strong>Finding a solution in pollution</strong></p><p>We don’t try to stop companies from producing plastic waste; that’s how they turn a profit. So, we wanted to offer them a more sustainable alternative in buying recycled, high-quality ‘fair-trade’ plastic, rather than producing their own.</p><p>After a successful campaign and four years of hard work, we did it!  Plastics For Change collected funding to launch the world's first Fair-Trade System for urban waste pickers. This system has been a game changer for a few reasons:</p><ul>
<li>We opened international markets for informal recyclers. They went from selling to middlemen for low prices to brands like The Body Shop.</li>
<li>We created a mobile platform that records all deals and work practices. This means waste-pickers can’t get cheated and receive the best deals.</li>
<li>Our practices and prices are certified by the World Fair Trade Organization. This ensures everyone is being treated fairly.</li>
<li>We offer training, recycling infrastructure, quality assurance, safety equipment and deals to our partners. This means they are upskilled to sell to global markets.  </li>
</ul><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560417242/rdlumlvipza0idilm5qq.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><strong>Achieving the impossible with fair trade plastic</strong></p><p>In 2015, we launched our first Indiegogo Campaign to create The World's First Fair Trade System for Urban Waste Pickers. The campaign was successful and provided funding to establish the initiative in India.</p><p>We have since:</p><ul>
<li>Recycled India’s first food-grade PET and sent it to Europe `</li>
<li>Met the righteous European safety standards</li>
<li>Became the first fair trade recycler to be certified by the World Fair Trade Organisation</li>
<li>Launched our fair trade plastic with The Body Shop and changed their plastic production lines</li>
</ul><p>So, we now want to replicate it and launch it in coastal communities that lack waste-management services. To do that, we need 10,000 USD. That’s the cost of recycling equipment and hiring staff to run a business based on fair-trade values.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Invest in your planet and in yourself today</strong></p><p>Well, what do waste-pickers in India and plastic pollution even mean to you? Isn’t this a problem you can think about later?</p><p>Unfortunately not, as we speak a garbage truck of plastic is entering the ocean each minute. A large majority of ocean plastic comes from 10 major rivers, 2 being in India. Plastic has also started entering the food chain in common dinner table items like salt, fish and even tap water. We are quite literally drowning in plastic.</p><p>Don’t be the sort of person who ignores this mess. You probably use plastic every day. Be part of something bigger than yourself and see the amazing impact of change. You may be thinking that a few dollars are just a drop in the ocean and won’t matter anyway. However, in a country like India, this little ‘drop’ can change lives and reduce global plastic pollution.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560418105/oinpjvc4kgzvi7bwr26p.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>(The average person consumes a credit card sized amount of microplastics every week)</p><p> </p><p><strong>Receive free ethical gifts for helping our recycling efforts</strong></p><p>We want you to join our journey for yourself, your future and your planet.

Where would you live? Would it be a comfy city apartment or a family house in the suburbs? Could you afford to send your kids to university?If you were like heroes of our story, most of the answers would wrench your heart. The estimated 1.5 million waste-pickers in India are some of the world’s most marginalized people. These waste pickers, many of them women, often live below the poverty line, work in appalling conditions and are shunned by society. Yet they form a critical line of defence in stopping plastic from entering our rivers and oceans. Hope in the trashThe global plastic pollution has given rise to an informal waste picking economy. Waste-pickers see the plastic as a valuable resource that can be collected and sold. Plastics For Change has developed a marketplace platform that connects waste-pickers with global brands and creates transparency through the supply chain. Our platform mobilizes thousands of waste-pickers to collect plastic that pollutes the environment. We provide a consistent supply of high quality recycled plastic for industry partners. Finding a solution in pollutionWe don’t try to stop companies from producing plastic waste; that’s how they turn a profit. So, we wanted to offer them a more sustainable alternative in buying recycled, high-quality ‘fair-trade’ plastic, rather than producing their own.After a successful campaign and four years of hard work, we did it!  Plastics For Change collected funding to launch the world's first Fair-Trade System for urban waste pickers. This system has been a game changer for a few reasons:
We opened international markets for informal recyclers. They went from selling to middlemen for low prices to brands like The Body Shop.
We created a mobile platform that records all deals and work practices. This means waste-pickers can’t get cheated and receive the best deals.
Our practices and prices are certified by the World Fair Trade Organization. This ensures everyone is being treated fairly.
We offer training, recycling infrastructure, quality assurance, safety equipment and deals to our partners. This means they are upskilled to sell to global markets.  
 Achieving the impossible with fair trade plasticIn 2015, we launched our first Indiegogo Campaign to create The World's First Fair Trade System for Urban Waste Pickers. The campaign was successful and provided funding to establish the initiative in India.We have since:
Recycled India’s first food-grade PET and sent it to Europe `
Met the righteous European safety standards
Became the first fair trade recycler to be certified by the World Fair Trade Organisation
Launched our fair trade plastic with The Body Shop and changed their plastic production lines
So, we now want to replicate it and launch it in coastal communities that lack waste-management services. To do that, we need 10,000 USD. That’s the cost of recycling equipment and hiring staff to run a business based on fair-trade values. Invest in your planet and in yourself todayWell, what do waste-pickers in India and plastic pollution even mean to you? Isn’t this a problem you can think about later?Unfortunately not, as we speak a garbage truck of plastic is entering the ocean each minute. A large majority of ocean plastic comes from 10 major rivers, 2 being in India. Plastic has also started entering the food chain in common dinner table items like salt, fish and even tap water. We are quite literally drowning in plastic.Don’t be the sort of person who ignores this mess. You probably use plastic every day. Be part of something bigger than yourself and see the amazing impact of change. You may be thinking that a few dollars are just a drop in the ocean and won’t matter anyway. However, in a country like India, this little ‘drop’ can change lives and reduce global plastic pollution.(The average person consumes a credit card sized amount of microplastics every week) Receive free ethical gifts for helping our recycling effortsWe want you to join our journey for yourself, your future and your planet. We are asking you to be a backer of our expansion. We are offering some great perks to all supporters. You can follow our online updates to see where your funding is going.

<p>“Becoming more and more familiar with the conservation work underway in Patagonia, I am inspired to pursue similar work closer to home. With a background in poetry, inquiry is at the heart of how I relate to the world. I am keenly interested in discovering and articulating the subtleties of our relationship with people and place, uncovering patterns that are at once familiar and surprising, and in engaging the reader in an intimate reflection of their relationship to the subject explored. I am excited about this project because it will provide me with a unique occasion to do just that, and in a landscape that is absolutely crucial to conservation efforts in North America. I have a life-long respect for nature and the outdoors, a zeal for stories and the craft of writing, extensive experience with photography, a long history with horses, and I have a deep interest in food and agriculture.

<p>“I was first acquainted with the Midwestern landscape on long road trips across the country with family and friends. Driving across the plains, it was impossible <em>not</em> to notice how transformed the landscape is, mainly for agricultural purposes, whether plowed for corn and soybeans or heavily grazed by cattle. What was harder to notice was the wildlife that remained: along the roadways, along the railroad tracks, in the small state and local parks, national grasslands set back from the highway, and on the few well cared for farms and ranches scattered through the country, host to the rapidly disappearing native plants and animals that barely hang on in these islands of refuge. It was also hard to see the people that remain in the towns, so many driven out by farm mechanization and consolidation, when you only see the rest-stops and major cities along the interstate. I always wanted to stop and explore those scattered communities, and meet the people for whom the prairie is truly home. As an advocate of sustainable agriculture, I also am deeply interested in exploring the potential options for the future of agriculture in the region, and the work of practitioners already underway. Driving through this wide stretch of country, I always want to slow down, get off of the main roads, to really know the place. This project excites me because it is an opportunity to do that in a very special way, combining my long time love of horses and travel with my passion for prairie conservation, sustainable agriculture, and creative forms of community development, and to share that experience with others.”  -Sebastian</p>

<h3>The goal<br/>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>In 1588 a Spanish Armada wreck sank off the coast of
Scotland and I have the license to investigate and recover all treasures and am
raising funds to enable this exploration. I have already undertaken surveys and
investigations on this wreck to give us its position. I am now looking for
funds to go and recover what is in it. Contemporaneous records talk about the
value of the wreck’s contents being 30,000,000. </p>
<p>I am seeking £390,000 to investigate the wreck and recover
the treasure from within. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<h3>The history<br/>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>In 1588, the King of Spain sent what was then the largest
fleet ever amassed to invade England. The English fleet stopped the Spanish
from invading, but bad weather then scattered the fleet and they were forced to
sail all the way round the north of Scotland and Ireland with only a few making
it back to Spain. One ship staggered into a sheltered bay in Scotland where it
remained for several months until there was an explosion on board which sank
it. The ship was carrying several treasures and these were stored in the part
of the ship that did not explode.</p>

<p>The remains of the wreck remained visible on the seabed

importance of the ship) and saw, but could not reach, a crown. In those days,
‘diving’ consisted of being lowered in a barrel. We know that none of the real
treasure was recovered from this wreck before it disappeared below the seabed.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>How will the money be spent?<br/>
</h3>
<p></p>The money will fund the team of divers and
investigators who will work to uncover the wreck (lying about ten feet below
the seabed). We will use a team of divers instead of robots as only humans can
do what is necessary. The advantage to the wreck lying under the mud, is that
it has prevented others from finding the wreck and recovering its treasure. <p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What is the benefit for the investor?<br/>
</h3>
<p></p>This wreck is privately owned and the treasure will be
sold at Sotheby’s of London who are contracted to do this and to safeguard
everything brought up. The benefit of investing in this project is the
historical value of recovering sixteenth century Spanish treasure, a chance to
own some of it and a substantial financial reward. The reward is based on a
sliding scale depending on how much is found and realised at sale and can be as
much as 150% after the initial investment has been repaid. <p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>My background</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>My background is an underwater map maker, oceanographer and
wreck investigator. During my career I have found and investigated many wrecks
both ancient and modern steel ones, including in the Falkland Islands, the
Caribbean, the deep mid-Atlantic (5,000 metres down) and many around UK
waters. My team of divers and researcher also has 20+ years of research into
ancient and modern wrecks. </p>
<p>I hope that you will be part of this exciting and historic
project that should also produce you substantial financial benefit as well. </p>
Please
help spread the word about this exciting and historic project<br/><p></p>

In 1588, the King of Spain sent what was then the largest

How will the money be spent?

This wreck is privately owned and the treasure will be
sold at Sotheby’s of London who are contracted to do this and to safeguard
everything brought up. The benefit of investing in this project is the
historical value of recovering sixteenth century Spanish treasure, a chance to
own some of it and a substantial financial reward. The reward is based on a
sliding scale depending on how much is found and realised at sale and can be as
much as 150% after the initial investment has been repaid. 

My background


My background is an underwater map maker, oceanographer and
wreck investigator. During my career I have found and investigated many wrecks
both ancient and modern steel ones, including in the Falkland Islands, the
Caribbean, the deep mid-Atlantic (5,000 metres down) and many around UK
waters. My team of divers and researcher also has 20+ years of research into
ancient and modern wrecks. 
I hope that you will be part of this exciting and historic
project that should also produce you substantial financial benefit as well. 
Please
help spread the word about this exciting and historic project",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Koda Quest is an innovative 3-D game for change app staring an
adorable polar bear named Koda who lives in the Arctic on a rapidly shrinking

<p>Players must care for Koda by feeding him and cleaning him,
but they only advance when they do things in the real world like recycle and
reduce electricity.  And, they can only
win the best rewards for Koda when their parents verify actions have been taken.
</p>
<p>At last, a game kids and parents can agree on!</p>
<p>This fundraising campaign will raise the necessary funds to allow
the non-profit organization Cool the Earth to complete Koda Quest and roll it
out to the world.</p>
<p><b>Background:</b></p>
<p><a href=""www.cooltheearth.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Cool the Earth</a> was
established seven years ago to raise awareness about climate change and inspire
kids and their families to take small, simple actions to reduce their energy
and water use. To-date, our School Program has reached 250,000 families who
have collectively taken over 300,000 actions to reduce their carbon footprint. The
School Program uses a child-driven model to inspire kids to make changes at
home which are then reported back to their school.</p>
<p>In 2010, researchers at Stanford University completed a
study of the School Program and found that participant children engaged their parents
in climate-positive action, and 33% of parents took new steps to help fight
climate change, such as purchasing earth friendly products and making energy
efficiency changes in their homes.</p>

<p>With that good news, Cool the Earth decided to increase the reach
and impact of the behavior-changing model by developing the fun and engaging
game Koda Quest, featuring a polar bear, Koda, who lives on a rapidly
shrinking iceberg. Players can slow the melting iceberg by caring for Koda and completing
real-world actions to lower their carbon emissions. </p>
<p>In the same way that Smokey the Bear taught kids to prevent
forest fires in the 1940s, Koda teaches children earth-friendly behavior by
asking them to complete real-world actions at home, such as turning off lights,
walking to school and taking a shorter shower. When children complete these tasks,
they see that their actions directly help Koda. </p>
<p></p>
<p>With 75% of U.S. children having access to smart mobile
devices, playing an average of 17 hours per week, and wielding considerable
influence in the family, a unique opportunity exists to address the climate
change challenge by melding grassroots real-world action with the application
of technology.</p>
<p>Cool the Earth is excited that Koda Quest will soon be
bringing the message of kid-powered behavior change to thousands of additional
families throughout the nation, at no cost! </p>

La idea es poder mantener tres meses aproximadamente la producción, para levantar la empresa y lograr colocarnos en el mercado internacional.    A todas la personas que contribuyan con este proyecto van a figurar en nuestra lista  de fundadores en mención honorifica en linea (Redes Sociales).Los que colaboren con $15 se les enviara una muestra de Coolant DEX de una unidad del tipo que requieran diesel/gasolina a la dirección que nos faciliten.Los que colaboren $25 se les enviara una muestra de Coolant DEX de cuatro unidades del tipo que requieran diesel/gasolina a la dirección que nos faciliten.Los que colaboren con $50 se les enviara una muestra de Coolant DEX de cuatro unidades y un Certificado Honorifico como colaborador externo de la empresa, a la dirección que nos faciliten.Los que colaboren con $100 se les enviara una muestra de 10 unidades de Coolant DEX diesel/gasolina mas un Certificado Honorifico como Colaborador externo de la empresa, a la dirección que nos faciliten. Los que colaboren con $500 se les enviara una muestra de 24 unidades de Coolant DEX diesel/gasolina mas un Certificado Honorifico como Colaborador VIP de la empresa, a la dirección que nos faciliten. Los que colaboren con  $1000 se les enviara una muestra de 50 unidades de Coolant DEX diesel/gasolina mas un Certificado Honorifico como Colaborador VIP de la empresa, a la dirección que nos faciliten y podrán optar por ser parte de nuestro equipo de distribución en la región de su interés, siempre y cuando allá disponibilidad en la región prometiendo le crédito después de 6 meses de operaciones. Ademas a todos los colaboradores se les dará prioridad cuando tengamos que seleccionar distribuidores.Pienso que con $200.000 puedo empezar este proyecto y ponerlo en marcha, si acaso no se lograra la meta, tendría que emplear los fondos que se recauden en atender prioridades como el alquiler de la bodega, la compra de empaque y materia prima, el pago de personal de producción y un poco de publicidad que me permita tener ventas a nivel local, para luego pensar con las utilidades obtenidas comprar maquinaria mas optima y buscar mercado internacionales.El Impacto Este invento es un  antioxidante solido soluble en agua, apto para cualquier sistema de enfriamiento donde el agua este en contacto con el hierro y se requiera que este no oxide. En esta modalidad existen muchos antioxidantes de diversas marcas todos ellos en presentación liquida. Este nuevo Coolant DEX, pretende brindarle al usuario una mayor calidad y cuidado en su sistema de enfriamiento. Utilizando este producto vamos a proteger el planeta, pues dejaremos de contaminar con millones de envases plásticos, con millones de cajas de cartón, por ejemplo. en una caja donde se envasan seis galones de coolant liquido, se pueden empacar seiscientas pastillas de Coolant DEX, lo que nos permite dejar de utilizar noventa y nueve cajas y seiscientos galones plásticos. A parte de esto dejaremos de contaminar el medio ambiente con las emisiones de gases producidos por los combustibles que se utilizan en el trasiego del coolant liquido pues una caja con seiscientas pastillas alcanza un peso promedio de tres kilos y medio, mientras que para seiscientos galones se ocupan cien cajas, seiscientos envases con un peso promedio de tres mil kilos. El usuario final va obtener un producto mas fácil de transportar, almacenar y de aplicar y va a colaborar en la preservación del planeta.   Otras formas en las que puedes ayudarA todos aquellos que lean sobre este proyecto empresarial y no puedan apoyar económicamente, pueden darnos un gran aporte transfiriendo esta información a familiares  y amigos en la red, esto creara consciencia de que hay una posibilidad mas de sostener el planeta y que también alguno podrá aportar su granito de arena y por su puesto estaremos muy agradecidos tanto con los que nos ayuden económicamente como con los que nos comenten con otros. muchas gracias. Para negocios o información puedes contactarnos en:Mijomova Internacional SATel: (506)22541800 - (506)85187611San José, Costa Ricahttp://more271051.wix.com/mijomova",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Our experience from many countries has shown we can bring real change, and fast, if a massive amount of people are mobilized for one positive cause. It’s all about ambition, action, cooperation and positivity.</span><br/></p>
<p>Active people in many countries have joined to clean up their countries in one day. In Latvia (210,000), Lithuania (250,000), Portugal (100,000), Slovenia (270,000), Romania (250,000), Albania (147,000), Hungary (200,000), Bulgaria (375,000), Ukraine (500,000), India (54,000), the Philippines (28,000) and in many other countries massive Let’s Do It! cleanups for a clean planet have been taking place.</p>
<p><b>Success stories</b></p>
<p>A real change has already happened in Slovenia. The same Let’s Do It! volunteers who cleaned up Slovenia are now leading the change to make Ljubljana the first capital city of Europe to be Zero Waste. Other municipalities and regions have already joined the plan to stop the waste and to start seeing materials as resources. Today, country-wide cleanup campaigns are no longer even necessary.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span>In Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, the cleanups have been so successful in bringing people together, that the tradition still persists. Even though there is no longer the need to mobilize such a massive amount of people to clean up litter. It’s now about celebrating civic activism and doing any kind of community work together.</span></p>
<p>According to the 2016 Environmental Performance Index, which
ranks 180 countries on how they protect human health and ecosystems, Estonia is
the eighth most environmentally friendly country on Earth. That’s a huge leap –
from 10 000 tonnes of waste in nature to one of the most environmentally friendly
countries on Earth. Slovenia ranks number five in the same category.</p>In many countries, Let’s Do It! has grown so fast, that it has created a new culture of civic activism and volunteering that was no longer there.

<p></p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>The idea of cleaning the world in one day might sound crazy, maybe even impossible, but we have the plan and we have had some amazing success stories, and some hard core experience. This is our foundation for a plan in which we truly believe in. </p>
<p>Our biggest risk is not finding the right people in time to lead country-wide cleanup actions. This is why every donation you make will be invested in finding and training these leaders, who really have it in them to make it happen. It’s the people who get things done! </p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>

</div></div>","Let’s Do It! World Cleanup happening world-wide and in ONE DAY - also in your country!With your kind help we can build up teams in all the countries in the world to organise the biggest civic action in human history - a World Cleanup Day on the 8th of September 2018. Your donation will make sure we find and train capable leaders in every country - including your country! We have unique experience mobilizing a big number of people – having involved ca 14 million people already! Imagine in 2018, a powerful “green wave” starting in Japan and ending in Hawaii with hundreds of millions of people taking positive action together on the same day.Our ultimate goal is a clean world, and we have a plan consisting of four big steps:Firstly, we are actively recruiting for ambitious leaders willing to run the massive nationwide cleanups.Then, using technology, the best professionals, and our worldwide volunteer base, we will map the world’s waste.Our third step will be to clean up the entire world in one massive world-wide cleanup day in September, 2018.
And finally, together with organizations, experts, and visionaries around the world we will create a plan to stop the waste problem once and for all. We can keep our planet clean, but only if we do it together.
Let’s Do It! is a civic-led mass movement that began in Estonia in 2008 when 50,000 people united together to clean up the entire country (10,000 tonnes of waste) in just five hours. Since then, we have spread this model—one country in one day—around the world. To date, 112 countries and almost 14 million people have joined us and cleaned up more than 500,000 tonnes of illegal waste.
Why are we doing this? Did you know that every year 20 million tons of garbage is added to our oceans, 80% of it from mainland waste. That’s like dumping over 710,000 Boeing 737 airplanes into the ocean…each year.The fact is, waste has a nasty little habit of not staying in one place. As trash begins to decompose, harmful chemicals and toxins begin to leak. First into the soil, then it spreads into the water and air– the very things that all living things depend on for a healthy life. Dirty drinking water, the spread of diseases, red-flag air pollution days… these are all related to the waste we produce.We need to do something about it, because waste is a worldwide problem and knows no borders.Why we need your help?If you share our dream of a Clean World, and wish to see the plan succeed, then support us and make a donation for the World Cleanup Day 2018.Your Support Will Help to Find & Train Over 150 Leaders Who Will Clean Up Their Countries in Just One Day - 8 September 2018If we really want a clean world and live to see it, we need your help. Let’s Do It! has never been only about waste. It’s about people. This is why it makes a lot of sense to kickstart the whole ambitious plan together with people like you. We have a plan and we have gathered enough experience to make it happen, but to raise the bar and unite 150 countries for a one massive civic action. Raising 150 000 € (ca $162 000) will be our seed money to make Let’s Do It! blossom around the world.We’ve invested 43,5 million hours of voluntary work to build teams, plan logistics, organise cleanups, etc. Every 100 € (ca 109 USD) raised helps to bring five new volunteers to a cleanup day.We need the funds to carry out every step of our plan. Even if we do not raise as much as planned here in Indiegogo (but we trust you, guys!), we will keep working our asses off, so that the trash problem would not come and bite you in the butt. But let’s be honest here, your help will make us meet the goals much faster.Our dedicated staff and volunteers are responsible for seeking out inspiring leaders across the globe, and supporting new and existing teams in their efforts to organize and lead teams of change-makers in their respective countries.If you are experiencing difficulties with payment (we are truly sorry!) you can become a supporter of World Cleanup Day 2018, by making a transfer to our bank account in Estonia.

Welcome on board! You are invited to Estonia, the birth country of Let’s Do It! and attend the Let’s Do It! Day of Civic Actions on May 7th 2016. We will treat you like the Clean World Captain you are, covering your accommodation, activities and meals. We will make sure you get a true local experience together with our Let’s Do It! World management team. Ever dreamed about white nights, a real sauna experience or want to see if WiFi works in the forest – we will plan a visit together with you, which you will never forget.





Our experience from many countries has shown we can bring real change, and fast, if a massive amount of people are mobilized for one positive cause. It’s all about ambition, action, cooperation and positivity.
Active people in many countries have joined to clean up their countries in one day. In Latvia (210,000), Lithuania (250,000), Portugal (100,000), Slovenia (270,000), Romania (250,000), Albania (147,000), Hungary (200,000), Bulgaria (375,000), Ukraine (500,000), India (54,000), the Philippines (28,000) and in many other countries massive Let’s Do It! cleanups for a clean planet have been taking place.
Success stories
A real change has already happened in Slovenia. The same Let’s Do It! volunteers who cleaned up Slovenia are now leading the change to make Ljubljana the first capital city of Europe to be Zero Waste. Other municipalities and regions have already joined the plan to stop the waste and to start seeing materials as resources. Today, country-wide cleanup campaigns are no longer even necessary.

In Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, the cleanups have been so successful in bringing people together, that the tradition still persists. Even though there is no longer the need to mobilize such a massive amount of people to clean up litter. It’s now about celebrating civic activism and doing any kind of community work together.
According to the 2016 Environmental Performance Index, which
ranks 180 countries on how they protect human health and ecosystems, Estonia is
the eighth most environmentally friendly country on Earth. That’s a huge leap –
from 10 000 tonnes of waste in nature to one of the most environmentally friendly
countries on Earth. Slovenia ranks number five in the same category.In many countries, Let’s Do It! has grown so fast, that it has created a new culture of civic activism and volunteering that was no longer there. Read about some of our success stories here.



Risks & Challenges
The idea of cleaning the world in one day might sound crazy, maybe even impossible, but we have the plan and we have had some amazing success stories, and some hard core experience. This is our foundation for a plan in which we truly believe in. 
Our biggest risk is not finding the right people in time to lead country-wide cleanup actions. This is why every donation you make will be invested in finding and training these leaders, who really have it in them to make it happen. It’s the people who get things done!

<p> </p>
<p><span style=""color: black; font-family: verdana; font-size: medium;"">I'm Tallulah, the UK Director of the Bonobo Conservation Initiative UK (<a href=""http://www.bonobo.org.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.bonobo.org.uk</a>).  I set up BCI-UK in 2011 after discovering that there were no existing charities for bonobos in the UK!  What started out as a frustration with the shocking lack of support for our fellow ape</span><span style=""font-family: verdana; font-size: medium;"">, ended up in a plan to leave my job as a Science teacher and to do something about it.  For the last two years I have been campaigning for the cause - a decision which has resulted in me dressing up as a bonobo to walk the streets of London on multiple occasions, hosting frequent burlesque fundraisers and tweeting, blogging and talking incessantly to anyone who will listen about why bonobos need our help!    </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana; font-size: medium;"">Over the last 18 months BCI-UK has raised over £9000 ($13,500) and <strong>all of our profits</strong> have funded community managed conservation projects.  </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""color: black; font-family: verdana; font-size: medium;"">Despite our successes I am asked the same question day after day:</span></p>
<p><strong><span style=""color: black; font-family: verdana; font-size: medium;"">                              What is a bonobo?</span></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""color: black; font-family: verdana; font-size: medium;"">It's hard to save what you don't know, and unless we get to know bonobos soon we may lose that chance forever.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana; font-size: medium;"">And so, this summer I will be travelling to DRC with my talented photographer friend, Emma, to film a documentary about bonobos and BCI's work to empower local communities to live sustainably.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: black; font-family: verdana; font-size: medium;"">I have never been to DRC or seen bonobos in the wild (despite running the charity, and having both a Zoology degree and a MSc in Primate Conservation).  The trip is sadly far from cost-effective requiring 3 planes into the interior of the Congo Basin - one international, one commercial and one chartered (all very exciting but cavorting around like James Bond doesn't come cheap).  But this summer a wonderful opportunity has arisen to share a chartered plane with a team of 8 to reduce costs (see full details below). The benefits of the expedition will more than pay for themselves:  The film will be an invaluable marketing and campaign tool raising public awareness and helping to showcase the work of BCI to an international audience and to future grant makers and sponsors. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style=""color: black; font-family: verdana; font-size: medium;"">The more people that know and care about bonobos the greater their chance of survival.</span></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""color: black; font-family: verdana; font-size: medium;"">Please help us to acheive this once in a lifetime opportunity if you can and help us to help the all-too-often forgotten ape.</span></p>

<h3>I am always amazed by the generosity and kindness of strangers and the ongoing support from friends and family, so I will just use this last bit of space to say... thank you.  We appreciate every penny!</h3></div>","Bonobos, the underdog of the primate world, have been waiting peacefully in the shadows for too long!  Overlooked by their primate cousins (that us humans), bonobos were the last of the great apes to be recognised by Science and remain 'the forgotten ape' to this day.  Underlined in red by spellcheck, omitted from Hollywood's Planet of the Apes and associated more closely with an electronic DJ from Bristol than with our closest living evolutionary relative...
                           ...it is an oversight that might cost us their lives. 
Please watch our video (including our pretty awesome animation about bonobos) to find out more!
 
I'm Tallulah, the UK Director of the Bonobo Conservation Initiative UK (www.bonobo.org.uk).  I set up BCI-UK in 2011 after discovering that there were no existing charities for bonobos in the UK!  What started out as a frustration with the shocking lack of support for our fellow ape, ended up in a plan to leave my job as a Science teacher and to do something about it.  For the last two years I have been campaigning for the cause - a decision which has resulted in me dressing up as a bonobo to walk the streets of London on multiple occasions, hosting frequent burlesque fundraisers and tweeting, blogging and talking incessantly to anyone who will listen about why bonobos need our help!    
Over the last 18 months BCI-UK has raised over £9000 ($13,500) and all of our profits have funded community managed conservation projects.  
 
Despite our successes I am asked the same question day after day:
                              What is a bonobo?
 
It's hard to save what you don't know, and unless we get to know bonobos soon we may lose that chance forever.  
And so, this summer I will be travelling to DRC with my talented photographer friend, Emma, to film a documentary about bonobos and BCI's work to empower local communities to live sustainably.
I have never been to DRC or seen bonobos in the wild (despite running the charity, and having both a Zoology degree and a MSc in Primate Conservation).  The trip is sadly far from cost-effective requiring 3 planes into the interior of the Congo Basin - one international, one commercial and one chartered (all very exciting but cavorting around like James Bond doesn't come cheap).  But this summer a wonderful opportunity has arisen to share a chartered plane with a team of 8 to reduce costs (see full details below). The benefits of the expedition will more than pay for themselves:  The film will be an invaluable marketing and campaign tool raising public awareness and helping to showcase the work of BCI to an international audience and to future grant makers and sponsors. 
 
The more people that know and care about bonobos the greater their chance of survival.
 
Please help us to acheive this once in a lifetime opportunity if you can and help us to help the all-too-often forgotten ape.
 
FAQ:
What is a bonobo?
I could talk all about bonobos non-stop but I'll give you the skinny version:  Bonobos are matriarchal, peaceful and empathetic, they avoid conflict by following the 'make love not war' philosophy.  All bonobos are bisexual, their societies are complex and egalitarian, governed by a sorority of unrelated females that develop close friendships.  They are highly intelligent and in scientific studies have been shown to consider other's feelings, share food with strangers rather than eat alone, demonstrate theory of mind and possess basic language distinguishing between food types and different threats with a range of specific calls.  They walk upright on two feet almost half the time, they live up to 50 years and will have up to 4 offspring in their lifetime.  All members of the group contribute to the child care responsibilities.  Bushmeating hunting aside, it's a pretty idyllic life for a bonobo...
 
Who are BCI?
BCI are an American organisation (www.bonobo.org) that work with local communities to empower people living within the bonobo habitat to have the means and the education to protect bonobos and safeguard their rainforest home.  The work that BCI do is remarkable, building leadership capacity, setting up health centres, establishing colleges that teach sustainable agriculture and conservation management and providing microfinance initiatives to support local livelihoods.  So much of their work goes by unnoticed by the world, they are currently in desperate need of funding to continue to support the 28 communities that they work with and to protect the remaining bonobo populations.  
BCI-UK is an independent British NFP organisation (www.bonobo.org.uk), set up under UK law, our mission is to raise awareness of bonobos and support ongoing efforts to protect bonobos by funding community managed conservation projects in DRC.
 
Why are bonobos endangered?
Bonobos are hunted for bushmeat in the beleagured Democratic Republic of Congo, where, due to recent wars, political instability and rural poverty up to 80% of protein is derived from wild meat.  Bonobos are only foung in DRC and their population, small to begin with, is fragmented and decreasing.  Whole populations have been wiped out from areas where they were once abundant.  Bonobos now only exist in small pockets of their former range and, based on the best evidence available, researchers estimate that less than 10,000 bonobos may remain.  If ever they needed to be bailed out of trouble by their big brother, the time is now.

<p>Do you know where the energy comes from when you switch on the lights at home? Over 40% of the world’s electricity comes from coal, and of all the fossil fuels, coal has the highest carbon content. The extraction and use of coal for energy is the single greatest threat facing our climate. Colombia is one of the largest coal exporters in the world. The majority of benefits from the coal industry are reaped by foreign entities extracting the coal, primarily for export to the United States and countries in Europe. Those facing the most adverse effects of coal operations are the communities living close to or forced to leave their homes near the mine.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>I've served in education for 13 years and am ready for a change. For several generations, my family farmed our land in Tennessee, and last summer, I decided to return to those roots. My life partner and I are currently in the process of building an organic hydroponic farm where we will grow tomatoes, cucumbers, cauliflower, lettuce, spinach, and beans. The building we will use has been part of the property for many years and has served many purposes, and with 2,400 square feet, it has plenty of room to get the farm productive. We intend on building more facilities as we move forward and also plan to install solar panels as we grow so that we are minimizing our energy consumption and creating a self-sufficient environment for the farm. Long-term, we want the farm to be a model for sustainability in the Tennessee Valley.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Organic farming has been slow to come to Tennessee, while traditional farming has been in decline for decades. We want to restore the local agricultural base to this area by creating a blueprint for other farmers to follow and stimulate awareness in the areas of sustainability, environmental conservation, and energy efficiency. Currently, there is a growing demand for fresh organic produce in this area but not enough local farms to supply this demand. We also want to provide agricultural jobs that pay a living wage to our employees and offer opportunities for them to live well.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Our purpose for choosing hydroponics as our primary growing medium is because of efficiency. Hydroponic farming utilizes 90% less water than traditional in-ground farming. Also, hydroponic farms can produce significantly higher yields per acre because the plants tend to grow faster and bloom earlier. Long-term, because of this efficiency hydroponics has the potential to revolutionize global food production and end famine.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Additionally, our region in East Tennessee has some of the worst obesity rates in the nation, both adult and juvenile, and we both want to reduce these rates by increasing awareness. We plan to educate as many people as we can about the benefits of fresh, unprocessed foods by developing partnerships with local school districts.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Currently, our two biggest needs for startup are materials to renovate the building for indoor growing and then the equipment for the hydroponic units. The building has sat unused for 16 years, and while the foundation and frame are still in excellent shape, the walls and ceiling need insulation and new wood, which will cost nearly $1,000. Each hydroponic unit requires a lighting system, irrigation, timers, and sensors to maintain efficient operation at an average cost of roughly $2,000 per unit. As an educator, I don't earn much and need help with the initial startup capital to get the building and first unit operational. My goal is to have it running by mid-May.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Please, donate what you can afford to help us launch this farm. Along the way, I will post many more updates to keep you informed of our progress. Your donation will help create a more environmentally friendly future.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Share our link with your friends, family, and co-workers. If you are interested in the environment and sustainable agriculture, please help us make this small step forward a reality.</p>

<p>We have a film crew joining us to document every step of our trip hoping to raise awareness of the tremendous injustice plaguing the developing world.  Did you know that their are still 1.1 Billion People in the world who do not have access to clean water?   And every day 4,000 children are affected by water related diseases.</p>
<p>By supporting me on my journey to Tanzania, I hope to raise awareness to the real problems crippling the developing world: disease, lack of access to basic needs, poor nutrition and death. This cause is extremely important to me for several reasons. First and foremost it was started by two dear friends who had a passion to make a difference and opened so many eyes to perils around the world. Also because as Westerners we take for granted something as simple as being able to pour a glass of water from the sink or take a shower at our leisure and I felt it was necessary to help spread the word about the struggles going on around the world. These are things that these villagers cannot even dream of.  We are incredibly fortunate to have access to organic foods and clean water when in some villages in Tanzania the locals have to walk 7 miles to collect 1 bucket of <strong>DIRTY</strong> water. The average family is lucky if they can get 4 gallons total....As Americans we average <strong>50 GALLONS PER PERSON!</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Water Facts -There are still 1.1 billion people in the world who do not have access to clean drinking water. 1.8 million children die every year as a result of diseases caused by unclean water and poor sanitation - this amounts to around 5000 deaths a day. More people die each year from unsafe water than from all forms of violence, including war.</strong></p>
<p>E.P.I.C. (Everyday People Initiating Change) is an organization my dear friends formed to show people from all walks of life that we have the ability to make a difference. As <strong>everyday people</strong>, WE can <strong>initiate</strong> the <strong>change</strong> that all the world’s nations are hungering for, and there is no better day to start than TODAY!  I am honored to be on the board of E.P.I.C and I am elated to embark on my first journey to Africa so I ask you to please donate, big or small, to my trip to Tanzania.</p>

My mission is to continue to raise awareness with E.P.I.C., Everyday People Initiating Change, to bring clean water to under developed villages in Africa. So far E.P.I.C has drilled 7 water wells. Our goal is to visit all 7 locations where they have drilled, and implement hygiene/sanitation programs.  The water wells are in Kawe, Weru, Mangalali, a village in Arusha, and two hamlets in Ugele.

<h2>Who We Are</h2>
<p>Sattya Media Arts Collective in Kathmandu Nepal has set out to transform a space into a modern adaption of a traditional chowk - Hariyo Chowk. Hariyo Chowk or 'green square' is an area to learn and share about urban greening and how to create a socially sustainable future for Kathmandu. </p>
<p>Hariyo Chowk has been made possible with a multifaceted team of passionately dedicated people knowledgeable about sustainable architecture, design, organic farming, photography, and media. Aside from our hired team, the 'green square' has come into fruition with help from dozens of volunteers, students, organizations, and volunteer teachers that have supported us since we began in the Spring of 2012. </p>
<h2>Why Kathmandu?</h2>
<p>As Kathmandu rapidly urbanizes there are fewer and fewer green spaces left in the city once known for urban farming. Air quality, pollution, and lack of electricity are daily problems for locals. Hariyo Chowk has the potential to grow a sustainable future with Kathmandu by empowering its people with environmental awareness, social sustainability and urban greening knowledge specific to the region's problems and resources. </p>
<h2>Things We Have Done</h2>
<p>So many people have helped us bloom to where we are today. With our initial fundraiser we were able to raise $12,000, which we have been using resourcefully towards construction, administration, workshop costs and salaries. Specifically Hariyo Chowk has:</p>
<ul>
<li>Designed and constructed our own green space to near completion. Hariyo Chowk's home base is used for holding fun and educational workshops, gardening, and documentary screening.</li>
<li>Built affordably with recycled and natural materials:<br/>- an outdoor urbanite pavilion<br/>- a bamboo structure for vertical gardening<br/>- a garden for native, edible, and medicinal plants<br/>- a compost bin to manage food waste and produce fertilizer<br/>- a workshop area for arts and education<br/>- a rainwater collection system to reduce reliance on city water<br/>- a sunken fire pit for outdoor gatherings <br/>- an earthen oven made out of mud bricks</li>
<li>Maintained media coverage via Facebook on our process and gained a following of over 1000 people.</li>
<li>Built relationships with community and local organizations</li>
<li>Held events and workdays for local community, youth and organization groups.</li>
</ul><h2>Our Campaign Goal</h2>
<p>Hariyo Chowk has has spent the last 8 months creating our own green space, a hub for the community to learn and practice sustainable gardening and building. We have been working resourcefully with existing contributions and will be celebrating our grand opening in March 2013. We are envisioning a new season to begin in April, in which we want to grow in two specific ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>To become financially self-sustained within Kathmandu. We will make this possible by selling plants and seed at markets, forging relationships with local organizations, and hosting affordable workshops, events, film screenings and even parties. </li>
<li>To make Kathmandu greener with guerrilla gardening, having workdays during which we will maintain existing public green spaces, aid people in start-up of community gardens and more edible plants, and starting a seed bank and library of native plant knowledge.</li>
</ul><h2>What We Need</h2>
<div>
<p>With a little extra watering, and $5,000 though Indiegogo, we will be able to take root<br/>in our own space, and start greening the city. Specially the $5,000 will go toward:</p>
<ul>
<li>Investing in a few good tools</li>
<li>Expansion into new locations which will require rent</li>
<li>Providing modest salaries for our dedicated team </li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>

<li>You can use the Indiegogo share tools to help get Hariyo Chowk support</li>
<li>Start where you stand and gureilla garden within your own community</li>
